ABSTRACT
We estimate a model of drug demand and supply that incorporates insurance, advertising, and competition
between branded and generic drugs within and across therapeutic classes. We use data on antiulcer
drugs from 1991 to 2010. Our simulations show generics and ``me-too'' drugs each increased consumer
welfare more than $100 million in 2010, holding insurance premiums constant. However, insurance
payments in 2010 fell by nearly $1 billion due to generics and rose by over $7 billion due to me-too
antiulcer drugs.

Abstract
We estimate a model of drug demand and supply that incorporates insurance, advertising,
and competition between branded and generic drugs within and across therapeutic classes.
We use data on antiulcer drugs from 1991 to 2010. Our simulations show generics and “metoo” drugs each increased consumer welfare more than $100 million in 2010, holding insurance
premiums constant. However, insurance payments in 2010 fell by nearly $1 billion due to generics
and rose by over $7 billion due to me-too antiulcer drugs.

Introduction
Prescription drug spending as a share of U.S. national income more than tripled between 1984

and 2010.1 This occurred despite the generic share of prescriptions quadrupling over the same
period.2 The increased use of generic drugs was facilitated by the U.S. Drug Price Competition
and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) which exempted
generic manufacturers from costly clinical trials. However, some branded manufacturers responded
by launching “me-too” drugs, meaning patented drugs that require clinical testing for regulatory
approval, but are little differentiated from drugs already on the market. The quintessential me-too
drug is Nexium (esomeprazole) which became one of the highest-selling drugs of all time, despite
being the fifth branded drug in its class and facing competition from generic versions of other drugs
in its class. We formulate a demand and supply model to examine how pharmaceutical followers –
both generic and me-too drugs – affect competition and welfare.

Prescription drug expenditures as a share of national income rose from 0.5% in 1984 to 1.7% in 2010, according
to National Health Expenditure data.

The generic share of prescriptions rose from 19% in 1984 to 78% in 2010 (Berndt and Aitken, 2011).

Some contend me-too drugs waste resources, perceiving that the gains in therapeutic value are
small given that their molecular structure is similar to existing drugs and, unlike generics, metoo drugs require costly clinical trials to gain approval. In 2000, the editor of the New England
Journal of Medicine recommended that regulators reject drugs that are too similar to existing
options: “requiring manufacturers to demonstrate that a new drug is substantially better than
anything available would help to stem the rising tide of me-too drugs” (Angell, 2000). Me-too
drugs may also drain regulatory resources, because they require approval by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), which has a backlog of drugs to review.3
A key challenge in quantifying the impact of new product entries in the U.S. drug market
is the pervasive role of health insurance.4 Insured patients only pay a fraction (copayment) of
the full price of pharmaceutical products, so the relevant price that the decision-maker faces is
typically much lower than the posted price recorded in national datasets. Moreover, insurers often
receive substantial rebates from manufacturers, creating an additional disconnect between the price
observed in the data and the actual payoff to the producer. Accounting for both distortions is
critical to performing meaningful counterfactuals: ignoring the first risks incorrectly concluding
that patients are insensitive to price, while ignoring the second distorts the implied costs faced by
suppliers.
Ours is the first study to tackle the distortions from both insurance copayments and rebates. To
account for copayments, we estimate the relationship between price and copayment using insurance
plan data, imputing copayments at the national level. The copayment-price relationship is then
used to link the supply-side modeling of pricing decisions to copayments. To account for rebates
paid by manufacturers to insurers, we exploit a government policy that constrains optimal rebates
prior to generic entry. For rebates after generic entry, we identify implied rebate levels from changes
in estimated marginal costs over time under the assumption that rebates are constrained prior to
generic entry. After generic entry, fixed-rebate marginal costs jump, indicating a change in rebates
consistent with the aforementioned cost distortion. We exploit this discrete jump to estimate the
new rebate level.
Our demand model also allows for rich substitution patterns among drugs, which is important
for obtaining accurate counterfactual predictions. To do so, we extend the work of Ellison et al.
(1997), Stern (1996), Branstetter et al. (2011), and Bokhari and Fournier (2013) by modeling
pharmaceutical demand using a discrete choice framework developed by Bresnahan et al. (1997).
The framework allows for correlations across multiple nests, or clusters, of products. In particular,
we allow for preferences to be correlated among products of the same class, same brand status
3

While faster review for potential blockbuster drugs can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to some manufacturers (Ridley et al., 2006), faster review for other drugs might be inefficient. For example, the fifth branded
drug in a class might not provide much variety or competition. Likewise, the same might be true for the fifth generic
version of the same drug.
4
While insurance is an important feature of health care markets in developed countries, in developing countries
like India there is little health insurance, so estimation of pharmaceutical demand does not need to account for the
role of insurance. See, for example, Chaudhuri et al. (2006).

(branded or generic), same form (tablet or capsule), and same molecule. Our framework allows
the data to inform whether (and quantify the extent to which) drugs that vary across one or more
of these dimensions are substitutes. Alternatively, drugs that vary across a dimension could be
treated as perfect substitutes, or as non-substitutes that exist in separate markets altogether. On
the supply side, we follow Bresnahan (1987) and others in modeling firms as playing a static pricing
game. Incorporating the supply side allows us to recover marginal costs as well as simulate how
prices would change under counterfactual scenarios.
We use monthly U.S. pharmaceutical price, advertising, and utilization data from 1991 to 2010.
We focus on classes of drugs that contain quintessential me-too drugs: the H2 antagonists (H2s)
and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including the aforementioned Nexium (esomeprazole), which
treat ulcers and reflux. Our data include generic entry for every H2 and PPI molecule that has a
generic version as of 2010.5
We estimate own-price (copayment) elasticities for branded drugs in the range of −1.5 to −5.1,
with higher magnitudes corresponding to branded drugs that face generic competition. As expected,
we find higher cross-price elasticities associated with the same classes, brand/generic statuses,
forms, and molecules. Cross-price elasticities are also higher when a drug faces more competition
from other sources. For example, an increase in the price of Nexium (esomeprazole), the market
leader from 2005 to 2010, has a much larger effect on other PPIs that face generic competition
than those that do not. This occurs because the primary market for PPIs faces generic competition
from those who have preferences for branded drugs. Hence, these drugs are particularly sensitive
to price movements by branded competitors.
Using our estimates of the supply-side and demand-side parameters, we perform two sets of
counterfactuals. The first considers removing the pharmaceutical followers currently on the market.
Removing me-too drugs (i.e. only keeping the first molecule in each class) or removing all generics
leads to substantial drops in utilization which correspond to drops in consumer welfare of more
than $100 million per year, holding insurance premiums fixed. However, the removal of these two
groups has starkly different effects on insurance payments and manufacturer profits, effects that
dwarf the consumer surplus changes. When generics are removed, profits gross of fixed costs rise by
over $1 billion as the market becomes less competitive. Insurance payments rise nearly $1 billion.
When me-too drugs are removed, insurance payments plummet, falling by over $7 billion annually,
with manufacturer profits also falling by more than $4 billion.
Our second set of counterfactuals examines the effects of generic competition for the blockbuster
me-too Nexium (esomeprazole). In the short run (a few months after generic entry) with one generic
manufacturer, the branded drug reduces its price and competes, so consumer welfare rises. Adding
additional generic competitors beyond the first has little effect on welfare because there is already
significant price competition between the branded and generic manufacturers. However, adding
5

The number of generic manufacturers that enter to compete with the branded manufacturer depends on market
size (Reiffen and Ward, 2005; Grabowski et al., 2007), advertising by the branded manufacturer (Scott Morton, 2000),
and the manufacturer’s previous experience (Scott Morton, 1999; Gallant et al., 2011).

generics does shift sales from the branded drug to the generics, effectively shutting the branded
drug out of the market.
If only one generic version of Nexium (esomeprazole) were available, we find that consumer
welfare would actually be higher in the short run than in the long run. In the long run, generic
quality is sufficiently high and marginal costs sufficiently low that the branded manufacturer would
raise its prices to compete only for consumers with strong preferences for branded drugs. This
phenomenon – the branded manufacturer raising its price in the face of generic competition – is
known as the “generic paradox” (Scherer, 1993).6 When the branded manufacturer raises price,
it is not only bad for consumers of the branded drug, but also for consumers of the generic drug,
because the generic drug manufacturer can raise its price as well. In this example, there is only one
generic manufacturer. However, in markets with high demand, many generic manufacturers enter.
With a second generic manufacturer, prices fall and consumer welfare rises. We estimate that with
two or more generic manufacturers of Nexium (esomeprazole), consumer welfare will rise by about
$200 million per year.

Dubois and Lasio (2013) also examine pharmaceutical demand in the antiulcer market. However,
in contrast to our study of the U.S. market, they consider the impact of price regulation, a key
institutional feature of most high-income markets, excluding the U.S. Exploiting cross-sectional
variation in the degree or existence of price regulation, they are able to identify the impact of
regulation in the settings in which it binds. Using their demand and supply estimates, they then
identify the impact of regulation and examine counterfactuals in which regulation is eliminated.
While several studies have examined the welfare implications of pharmaceutical competition
(Chaudhuri et al., 2006; Granlund, 2010; Branstetter et al., 2011; Dutta, 2011; Bokhari and
Fournier, 2013), our paper is alone in tackling the intervening role of insurance, a key institutional feature of the U.S. market.7 Pharmaceutical studies using U.S. data frequently recover price
elasticities that are inconsistent with profit maximization under standard models of supply, making
it difficult if not impossible to solve for equilibrium prices in counterfactual simulations, thereby
sharply limiting the scope of analysis.8 Further, consumer welfare calculations hinge on the magni6

When faced with generic competition, the price of the branded drug sometimes remains relatively high or even
increases. This might be explained by a perception among consumers that the branded drug is higher quality (Frank
and Salkever, 1997; Grabowski and Vernon, 1992; Regan, 2008). Alternatively, the branded manufacturer’s optimal
price path might be increasing, with entry by a generic causing a fall relative to trend but not relative to previous
prices (Bhattacharya and Vogt, 2003). Finally, branded drug prices might increase slowly after generic entry due to
consumer heterogeneity in price sensitivity and the resolution of consumer uncertainty about generic quality (Ching,
2010a).
7
Bokhari and Fournier (2013) also solve for counterfactual prices using U.S. data, but their study differs from
ours in two important ways. First, they use an Almost Ideal Demand System instead of a discrete choice framework.
Second, like the aforementioned studies, they lack copayment data and must use price.
8
Pharmaceutical studies using U.S. data frequently estimate price elasticities in the inelastic portion of the demand
curve. For example, in a meta-analysis by Gemmill et al. (2007), mean demand elasticity for pharmaceuticals was -0.2
(and mean standard error was 0.026). There are two concerns with estimates of demand that are inelastic. First, the
inelastic demand estimates typically apply only to cases where copayments or prices move in unison. Previous studies
focused on copayments moving together due to a paucity of data. For example, Leibowitz et al. (1985), one of the
drug demand elasticity studies surveyed by Gemmill et al. (2007), wrote that they could not estimate cross-copayment

tude of the price coefficient in the estimated indirect utility function, highlighting the importance
of having correct pricing data.9 We show that our linking of prices and copayments yields economically reasonable elasticity estimates, making it possible to obtain both counterfactual equilibrium
prices as well as conduct welfare analysis.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on the antiulcer
market and shows how it has evolved over time. Section 3 describes the demand model, including
a discussion of copayments and the evolution of the outside good. Section 4 explains the model
of supply and the role of rebates. Section 5 gives the estimates of both the demand and supply
models as well as showing their implications for elasticities and the evolution of rebates. Section 6
shows the counterfactuals, including the removal of generic or me-too drugs and the introduction
of generic Nexium (esomeprazole). Section 7 concludes.

Background and Data
Our focus is on the “antiulcer” market, which includes not only drugs that treat ulcers but

also reflux (“heartburn”).10 The prevalence of reflux in the population is between 10% and 20%
(Fedorak et al., 2010) and the prevalence of ulcers is approximately 1% (Kurata and Haile, 1984).
The earliest entrants into the antiulcer market were H2 antagonists (H2s), followed by proton pump
inhibitors (PPIs). H2s inhibit peptic acid by blocking histamine receptors on acid-secreting cells in
the stomach lining. PPIs work more directly than H2s by inhibiting the proton acid pump in the
lining of the stomach.11
The H2s and PPIs include quintessential me-too drugs. For example, Zantac (ranitidine) was
the second drug in the H2 class, and became one of the top-selling drugs in the world in the 1990s.
Nexium (esomeprazole) was the fifth drug in the PPI class, and became one of the top-selling drugs
in the world in the 2000s.
The scientific community, including the FDA, regards the antiulcer drugs as close substitutes.
Only the first H2 and the first PPI were granted priority review at FDA. However, manufacturers
elasticity because coinsurance was the same across products. Second, the inelastic demand estimates make it hard to
construct a model of profit maximization and thus estimate counterfactuals. After all, if firms price in the inelastic
portion of the demand curve, then raising price would increase profit. In contrast to the previous literature, our study
uses variation in copayments and prices across drugs within a given year to estimate cross-copayment elasticity. One
exception is Ridley (2014) who used data that is similar to ours and found demand to be considerably more elastic
than in previous research, but in a reduced-form analysis.
9
See Brand et al. (2012) for a discussion of the importance of using copayments rather than price when analyzing
health care markets in the United States. They treat hospital copayments as resulting from a bargaining game
between hospitals and insurance companies.
10
We use the term “antiulcer” to be consistent with previous economic research (Berndt et al., 1995, 2003).
11
The antiulcer drugs are indicated for short-term treatment, but can be used considerably longer. For example,
Nexium’s FDA-approved label says that it is indicated for short-term treatment (4 to 8 weeks) in the healing and
relief of symptoms associated with erosive esophagitis. However, the label also says that Nexium may be used for
additional weeks if the patient has not yet been healed. Furthermore, the label says that the use of Nexium may
be continued to maintain the healing. Finally, Nexium is indicated for treatment of heartburn and other symptoms
associated with GERD.

5

of these me-too drugs assert that their drugs are superior, or at least different. For example,
the manufacturer of Zantac (the second H2) claims at least five advantages over the first mover,
including lower relapse rates, fewer side effects, and more indications (Berndt et al., 1995). Likewise,
Nexium (the fifth PPI) is advertised as the “healing purple pill”. The FDA-approved label reads:
“Nexium 40mg demonstrates higher healing rates in erosive esophagitis than Prilosec 20mg (the
approved dose for this indication)”. Hence, while the FDA regards the drugs as close substitutes,
the manufacturers claim otherwise. Ultimately, the question is whether doctors and patients see the
drugs as close substitutes. Using a revealed preference approach, we investigate whether demand
is sensitive to price differences across the drugs, and whether the availability of new drugs in the
class increases welfare.
The two most popular forms of H2s and PPIs are capsules and tablets. As shown in Table 1,
tablets dominate the H2 market and capsules dominate the PPI market. However, there is some
crossover: nizatidine (an H2) competes as a capsule, while pantoprazole and rabeprazole (PPIs)
compete as tablets.
The first H2s came off patent early in our sample period, while the three most recent PPIs
remain on patent at the end. As shown in Table 1, branded H2s entered from 1977 to 1988 and
began facing generic competition in 1994. By 2001, all branded H2s faced generic competition, with
cimetidine and ranitidine each having more than thirty generic manufacturers. Branded drugs in
the PPI class entered between 1989 and 2009 with generic entry beginning in 2002.
We use sales and advertising data from SDI Health (later acquired by IMS Health). The
sales data include units (for example, number of pills), prescriptions, and dollar value for sales of
prescription drugs sold at U.S. retail pharmacies from 1991 through 2010. The advertising data
include detailing at the molecule-manufacturer-month level. We show the evolution of prescriptions,
prices, and advertising in sections 2.1 through 2.3.
A second data source is needed because the price the manufacturer receives from a sale is
generally not the price the consumer faces due to insurance. Information on copayments (the
prices consumers face) were provided by AdvancePCS, a pharmaceutical benefit plan administrator.
The copayment data include copayment by molecule-insurer-month for a subset of the years. We
describe the copayment data and the details of the insurance market in section 2.4.

2.1

Prescriptions

We first examine how prescription quantities vary over time. Our analysis focuses on retail
sales of the most popular doses of prescription medications.12 Figure 1 illustrates the evolution
12
The market we examine is restricted along three dimensions. First, we focus on retail sales rather than hospital
sales. From 2003 to 2010, retail sales accounted for 91% of PPI prescriptions. We were able to compare retail
to hospital sales using another data set with less periodicity (annual rather than monthly) and a shorter time
period (2003-2010 rather than 1991-2010). Second, we focus on the most popular dose for each drug which covers
approximately 90% of all prescriptions. Third, we focus on prescription medications rather than the over-the-counter
market. According to an analyst report, over-the-counter drugs accounted for 16% of the retail PPI market from
February 2009 to February 2012. Section 3.3 describes how we account for over-the-counter availability in our

6

of the market’s composition by molecule and brand/generic (B/G) status, while Table 2 provides
corresponding market shares by molecule. Here, prescriptions are aggregated across all generic
manufacturers of the same molecule. Prior to 1993, H2s controlled the market, with branded ranitidine (Zantac) as the market leader, accounting for over half of all prescriptions. In the mid 1990s,
branded omeprazole (Prilosec, the first PPI) became the market leader. Later, branded lansoprazole (Prevacid, the second PPI) became the market leader. In the last five years of the sample,
omeprazole (now available as a generic) had a quarter of the market, as did esomeprazole (available
exclusively as the branded drug Nexium), with the remaining half of the market distributed across
various H2s and PPIs.
Figure 1 illustrates the fic growth in the PPI market. The PPI market grew rapidly in part by
stealing from the H2 market as can be seen in the decline of the H2 market. However, the total
prescription anti-ulcer market was clearly expanding. New entrants to the PPI market advertised
heavily. Also, new patients might have entered the market, for example seeking relief from ulcers
caused by non-steroidal inflammatory drugs. Finally, generic entry increased access by dramatically
reducing prices (Figure 3). With lower generic prices, branded share eroded rapidly. For example,
six months after the entry of generic ranitidine, the branded share had fallen by 90%. The impact
was similar for the remaining H2s and the PPIs with generic versions. Nonetheless, branded drugs
maintain a small segment of the market for a few years after initial generic entry.
The overall evolution of market shares is different for PPIs and H2s, reflecting differences in
both business stealing and market expansion. H2 prescriptions peaked in 1995 at just over 3.5
million, but declined steadily thereafter as more PPIs were brought to market. However, total
prescriptions rose dramatically, from just over 2.25 million in 1991 to over 9 million by 2011. Both
trends are illustrated in Figure 2.
Preferences for particular forms may also be important, as the side effects and release times can
vary between tablets and capsules.13 Nizatidine and famotidine have similar branded shares in the
1990s, but dissimilar generic shares in the 2000s. The difference occurs when PPIs are becoming
bigger players. A possible explanation for generic famotidine outpacing generic nizatidine is that
PPIs are generally of the same form (capsule) as nizatidine and are therefore better substitutes.

2.2

Prices

We next examine the evolution of prices. Our data include revenue and the number of prescriptions. We divide revenue by prescriptions to calculate an average price per prescription. We
do not use list price. We have only retail sales data, but retail accounts for 90% of the market for
estimation.
13
Breitkreutz and Boos (2011) note that oral forms (i.e. tablets and capsules) are generally preferred, but some
patients might not find them easy to swallow, and also note that different patients can have different sensitivities to
inactive ingredients (which can vary across forms). Jones and Francis (2000) find that, when comparing tablets to
capsules, the relative ease of swallowing, perceived speeds of action, and perceived durations of action can all vary
from patient-to-patient. As the authors conclude, “consumers have preferences for particular dosage forms.”

near $75. Over time, the branded price climbed to nearly $150, while the generic price fell below
$20. The decline in generic prices might be explained by an increase in generic competition over

time, or by falling marginal costs due to learning-by-doing in production. The fact that branded
prices do not fall (and often rise) despite the collapse of their market shares suggests the relevant
competitive adjustment occurs along a different dimension. From Figure 1, however, the fall in
H2 generic prices does not appear to be associated with increased prescriptions. This suggests
the rise of PPIs — in addition to expanding the prescription market — results in fewer generic
prescriptions.

Advertising

We include detailing data at the molecule-manufacturer-month level. While manufacturers also
use direct-to-consumer advertising, spending on detailing to physicians is much greater.14 Over 99%
From 1996 to 2005, manufacturers spent $58 billion on detailing compared to $27 on direct-to-consumer advertising (Donohue et al., 2007). For PPIs from 2000 to 2002, manufacturers spent four times more on detailing than
direct-to-consumer advertising (Ridley, 2014).

of detailing was by branded manufacturers. Generic advertising is excluded because it is negligible
and could not be attributed to a particular firm.
Figure 4 illustrates cumulative advertising expenditures. For a given molecule, branded advertising (of all types) typically ends once a generic enters.15 Advertising substantially increased after
the introduction of PPIs, particularly for lansoprazole and esomeprazole. The trends in advertising
expenditures match well with changes in prescriptions, paralleling the dramatic increase in PPI
prescriptions since 2000. Hence, while advertising may promote product switching, it also appears
to expand the market.

2.4

Insurance

In 2010, 96% of prescriptions for H2s and PPIs were purchased with insurance. Insurance
complicates the modeling of pharmaceuticals by separating the price paid by the consumer from
the price received by the manufacturer. First, copayments paid by the insured are below prices
received by the manufacturer. Second, branded manufacturers give substantial rebates to insurance
companies. We account for both copayments and rebates.
First, we account for copayments. Because copayments are below prices, the insured have
higher quantity demanded than the uninsured. This is the “moral hazard” problem.16 We ac15

One exception (from outside our market) was Pfizer which continued to advertise anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor
for 6 months after patent expiration, but Pfizer’s strategy was novel, and unsuccessful in retaining sales.
16
Insurers can drive down prices using their market power and the promise of steering market share for one drug
(Duggan and Scott Morton, 2010; Ridley, 2014). Hence, insurers can get lower prices than the uninsured. Nevertheless,
the moral hazard problem remains because insured consumers pay copayments that are below the actual prices.

12

count for the relationship between price and copayment using copayment data from AdvancePCS,
a pharmaceutical benefits manager. The sample includes the first four PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole), 63 insurance groups, and 25 months between 2000 and 2002.17
Insurance groups with $0 copayments were dropped as unrepresentative.
The copayment sample is representative of the U.S. market along three dimensions. First,
average copayments for the sample match average copayments nationally. Mean price was $150
and mean copayment was $18, which is consistent with national averages for the sample period.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2002 the average branded copayment for insurers
with two tiers (generic, brand) was $18.18 Second, average market shares across insurance groups
in the sample match market shares nationally. Average market shares from the insurance data
differ from the national data by no more than one percentage point. Third, the data vendor
(AdvancePCS) reports that its own analysis shows that its data closely match United States Census
Bureau estimates of the distribution of the U.S. population based on age, sex, and geographic region.
Using the copayment data, we estimate the relationship between copayment and price. We need
this relationship to hold over time in order for the two-year sample to represent the full two decades
of the study. As we show in Figure 3, branded prices are rising over time and generic prices are
falling. Hence, in order for our method to represent the full two decades, then national branded
copayments must be rising as branded prices rise, and national generic copayments must be falling
as generic prices fall. In fact, this is true. Between 2002 and 2010, branded copayments rose from
$18 to $28, while generic copayments changed from $9 to $10. Hence generic copayments decreased

in inflation-adjusted terms.
Second, we account for rebates, although we do not directly observe rebates. Rebates are paid by
the manufacturer to the insurer in return for a lower copayment tier. The rebates are not public,
presumably because manufacturers will pay an insurer a greater rebate if that manufacturer’s
other customers are unaware of it (Kyle and Ridley, 2007).19 While rebate data are not public, an
understanding of the regulation suggests a method for inferring rebates. Under the Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program, branded drug manufacturers must either give the U.S. government their best
price or 15.1% off their average price.20 During the 1990s and 2000s, if a manufacturer increased
its rebate to any insurer above 15.1% of its average price, then the manufacturer had to increase
its rebate to the U.S. government. Hence, manufacturers could credibly tell an insurer it was too
costly to offer a rebate above 15.1% off its average price. In the antiulcer market, it is reasonable
to expect high rebates. Hence, we assume a corner solution: a rebate of 15.1% prior to generic
entry. Prior to generic entry, manufacturers attempt to keep rebates at 15.1% to limit the best price
17

Note that this is a period where no generic PPI’s are present.
Kaiser Family Foundation, “Employer Health Benefits Survey 2013,” http://ehbs.kff.org/.
19
While rebates are not included in our data, discounts are included. For example, if the manufacturer gives the
wholesaler a discount for prompt payment, such a discount is captured in the data.
20
The 15.1% discount was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. See Sec. 1927(c) of the
Social Security Act, available at http://www.ssa.gov/OP Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm. The rebate was increased
to 23.1% under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.

obligation to Medicaid. We use this to identify the marginal costs. After patent expiration, the
Medicaid penalty constraint is lifted because Medicaid switches to generics. Hence, we assume that
the jump occurs at patent expiration. After generic entry, the constraint is relaxed, because sales
to Medicaid become a much smaller share of business (state Medicaid programs typically don’t pay
for a branded drug when a generic version is available). Hence, we assume that the rebate jump
occurs when generics enter. To check whether our rebate estimates are sensible, we compare data
on pharmaceutical sales for a molecule in a year to annual reports from the companies regarding
revenue from the molecule in the year. The results are described in section 4.1.
We assume that insurance separates the price consumers pay from the price manufacturers
receive, and thus we assume that insurance is purely distortionary. We ignore an often cited
benefit of health insurance: reducing the variation in health spending which increases the utility
of risk-averse people. For example, a person insures against hospital costs, because hospital costs
can vary dramatically for a given person across years. However, in the antiulcer market, there
is much less variation in spending, so antiulcer drugs are less like hospitalization and more like
gasoline, and people typically do not purchase gasoline insurance. The presence of insurance for
drugs in this class might not be driven by risk aversion, but driven by direct government subsidies to
constituents, such as seniors (in the form of the Medicare drug benefit), or by indirect subsidies in
the form of tax breaks (U.S. health insurance is an untaxed benefit when provided by an employer).
Hence, our assumption that insurance is distortionary might be appropriate in this context.

3

Demand
Our demand model allows for four types of product differentiation: (i) between classes (H2 and

PPI), (ii) between brands and generics (for example, branded omeprazole and generic omeprazole),
(iii) between forms (capsule and tablet), and (iv) between molecules (branded omeprazole and
branded lansoprazole).
One type of switching – from brand to generic of the same molecule – is quite common. The
pharmacist can freely switch a patient from branded lansoprazole to generic lansoprazole, unless
expressly forbidden by the physician.21 A second type of switching – from brand to brand of
different molecules – is also common. Physicians might prescribe a different molecule based on
experience (Crawford and Shum, 2005), on scientific evidence (Azoulay, 2002), or on information
provided by detailing from drug sales representatives (Berndt et al., 1995; Ching and Ishihara, 2010;
Ridley, 2014).22 The third and fourth types of switching (across classes and forms) have received
less attention in the literature.
21

In most states, a pharmacist can substitute generic lansoprazole for branded lansoprazole unless the physician
forbids it, for example by writing “do not substitute” (in California) or “dispense as written” (in Colorado) on the
prescription.
22
There is mixed evidence about which of the aforementioned types of switching is more important. Ellison et al.
(1997) found that competition between a brand and its generic is greater than between brands. However, Lichtenberg
and Philipson (2002) found the opposite.

14

Our model allows products with the same characteristics in any of our types of differentiation
to be better substitutes than those products that are not. For example, a consumer taking branded
omeprazole might consider branded lansoprazole to be a better substitute than generic omeprazole.
Similarly, a consumer that prefers capsules (due to their faster release time) may let the form drive
their choice of therapy.

3.1

Theory

Consumer choice is modeled using a differentiated products, discrete choice demand system.
Potential buyers choose one of Jt + 1 treatments, with the first Jt requiring a prescription (the
remaining choice being the “outside good”). Consumer i’s conditional indirect utility from choosing
product j in period t is given by:
uijt = αpcjt + Xjt β + ζj + ξjt + ijt ,

(1)

where pcjt is the time-t copayment (consumer price) for product j (described in detail shortly), Xjt
is a set of time-varying observed product characteristics (e.g. advertising), ζj is a product-specific
intercept (fixed effect) that captures any product characteristics (observed or unobserved) that
are fixed over time, and ξjt is a time-varying random effect that captures unobserved shocks to
demand, promotional activity, or changes in brand equity. Note that the coefficient on copayment
gives us the utility-to-dollars conversion. Individual preference heterogeneity enters through an
idiosyncratic taste parameter ijt , that is independent across buyers but may be correlated among
similar products. The mean utility (across consumers) for product j at time t is then given by
δjt = αpcjt + Xjt β + ζj + ξjt .

(2)

A flexible distribution for ijt is essential for capturing rich substitution patterns, which play
a key role in the counterfactual exercises that follow. To do so, we use the approach developed
by Bresnahan et al. (1997) which extends the familiar nested logit to allow unobserved preferences
to be correlated across multiple nests.23 For example, the unobserved preference for a particular
form of a branded drug will be correlated with the unobserved preferences for other drugs of the
same form but will also be correlated with the unobserved preferences for other branded drugs.
In particular, we assume that the unobserved preference parameters follow a generalized extreme
23

An alternative is the random coefficients (mixed) logit framework developed by Berry et al. (1995) which does not
require an ex-ante choice of nests and yields flexible substitution patterns. We believe the Principles of Differentiation
Generalized Extreme Value (PDGEV) approach developed by Bresnahan et al. (1997) to be a reasonable choice in
our context because 1) the set of nests (or clusters) of products is straightforward here, 2) the relevant product
characteristics are almost exclusively binary, and 3) we do not have access to rich demographic or multi-market share
data that are key to pinning down a more flexible distribution of random parameters (we must rely on changes over
time in the set of available products and their relative prices). See Bresnahan et al. (1997) for a detailed discussion of
the mechanism by which the PDGEV approach affords richer substitution patterns than the either the multinomial
or nested logit.

where Gj is the partial derivative of G with respect to the j th argument. Let L indicate the
number of (observed) characteristics on which the unobserved preferences may be correlated and
let λl denote the possible values of characteristic l, for l = 1, . . . , L. Following Bresnahan et al.
(1997), we can then specify G as:

where I(j, k, l) is an indicator variable taking on the value one if product j has the k th value of
the lth characteristic and ρl ∈ [0, 1] is the nesting parameter along the lth dimension. Finally, the
scaling parameters al are defined as:
1 − ρl
,
al = PL
l=1 (1 − ρl )
which assures the a’s for any product j add up to one and the properties of a multivariate GEV
distribution are satisfied for ρ ∈ [0, 1].
The market share of product j at time t can then be found by differentiating the log of G with
respect to its j th element, and can be computed in closed form. Denoting kjl as the value that
product j has on the lth dimension,

Note that, as in Bresnahan et al. (1997), when all ρ’s go to 1, we move to a multinomial logit,
whereas when all ρ’s but one go to 1, we move to a nested logit.
Figure 5 illustrates the nesting structure. For the cube on the left, each vertex represents a
unique combination of the class, brand/generic, and form. The gray edges represent substitution

across classes. The dashed edges represent substitution between branded and generic drugs. The
dotted edges represent substitution across forms. At each vertex, there are a given number of
molecules (generally greater than two, and varies for different class-brand/generic-forms). Each
molecule is represented by a single spoke of a vertex, as shown by the close-up on the right.24

3.2

Copayments and Price

The price a consumer pays (pcjt ) is different from the price received by the pharmaceutical
manufacturer (pjt ) due to insurance. First, the insurer sets copayment tiers. For example, an
insurer sets generic copayments at $10, preferred branded copayments at $30, and non-preferred
branded copayments at $50. While we do not model the optimal formulary structure for insurers,
these decisions are likely independent of any one drug or class of drugs. Second, the insurer assigns
drugs to tiers based on the price. For example, if the price of Nexium is high, then Nexium is
assigned to the non-preferred branded tier of $50. We model the relationship between copayment
and price as a power function where the power is less than one.25 In particular, we assume log
copayments are a linear function of log price:

ln pcjt = φ0 + φ1 ln (pjt )
24

(8)

To be clear, molecule does not constitute a lower level nest; however, there is no molecule that exists as both an
H2 and as a PPI, so there cannot be substitution across classes without substitution across molecules. Molecules are
depicted differently in Figure 5 in part because at least one of the four types of differentiation could not be depicted
as a spatial dimension, and also because it is the only type that is not binary, so that representing molecules along a
spatial dimension would have required a substantially more complicated diagram.
25
The power function pushes low copayments higher and high copayments lower. This matches reality, because
copayments are rarely as low as the lowest price (some people have generic copayments of $10 while Wal-Mart sells
some generics for $4) and rarely as high as the highest price (which is the nature of insurance).

17

We estimate the parameters of equation (8) using our SDI Health data merged with AdvancePCS
copayment data.26
We use these estimates and our data on prices to form predicted copayments for branded drugs
in all periods in which they did not face generic competition as none of the drugs in the AdvancePCS
data faced generic competition. To obtain copayments for generic drugs and branded drugs with
generic competitors, we assume that the curvature of the pricing relationship is the same as in (8).
For generic drugs, we adjust the price level such that the average price of generics are equivalent to
the average price of generics given in Kaiser Family Foundation’s report “Employer Health Benefits
Survey 2013.”27 For branded drugs who face generic competition, we add an indicator variable to
the indirect utility function, implying that facing generic competition leads to a level change in the
copayment formula.

3.3

Outside Good

Estimation of an aggregate discrete choice demand system requires the overall sales (or market
shares) of the inside goods as well as the number of consumers who choose the outside good. To
construct the share (and overall size) of the outside good, we assume the market for H2 antagonists
and PPIs is 20% of the total U.S. population (the estimates are not particularly sensitive to this
choice), which is in the range reported by Fedorak et al. (2010). Multiplying the 20% prevalence
by the U.S. population gives the market size. For example, in December 2010 the U.S. population
was 311 million, so the overall market size is assumed to be 62 million.
In addition to prescription drugs, there are over-the-counter drugs available without a prescription. The first over-the-counter H2 (famotidine) became available in 1995 (Ling et al., 2002), and
the first over-the-counter PPI (omeprazole) became available in 2003. Over-the-counter drugs are
typically available at half the prescription strength and may be viewed as competing with other
over-the-counter drugs (including calcium carbonate which is sold as “Tums”). Over-the-counter
H2s and PPIs are a small share of the market that changes little over time. For example, according
to an analyst report, over-the-counter drugs accounted for a mean of 16% (standard deviation of
2%) of the retail PPI market from February 2009 to February 2012.28 Nevertheless, it is important
to account for over-the-counter sales.
We account for changes in the over-the-counter market in two ways. First, we include time
dummies that vary by class. Hence, over-the-counter drugs can have differential effects by class.
We assume that when an H2 drug goes over-the-counter, it affects all H2 prescriptions in the same
way and all PPI prescriptions in the same way, but the effects may vary across classes. We are
able to include time dummies by class because we have twenty years of monthly data. Second, we
26
In subsequent estimation stages, we treat these imputed prices as given. Alternatively, the entire procedure could
be bootstrapped (or the moments efficiently stacked) to improve inference.

18

include a dummy variable for whether an over-the-counter drug of the same molecule exists and
interact this variable with generic status. In this way we relax the assumption that when a PPI
goes over-the-counter it affects all PPI’s identically as well as allowing the competitive effects of
over-the-counter drugs to vary by branded/generic status.

3.4

Time-Varying Characteristics

We allow for time-varying product characteristics, Xjt , to affect utility (any time-invariant
characteristics will be subsumed by the product-specific fixed effects). First, as described above,
we allow for time dummies that vary by class. This is important because consumer perceptions
and over-the-counter offerings may change over time.
Second, we include cumulative log advertising at the molecule-manufacturer-month level. As
discussed in the data section, our measure of advertising is detailing, which only occurs for branded
drugs. In previous studies of the effect of detailing on demand for antiulcer drugs, the estimated
depreciation rate for the (detailing) advertising stock was zero percent (Berndt et al., 1995; Ling
et al., 2002; Ridley, 2014). Hence, we use the advertising stock with zero depreciation. All forms of
the same molecule receive the same utility bump from advertising. Note that we treat advertising as
exogenous. Advertising schedules and budgets are typically laid out far in advance, and do not react
to the high-frequency (monthly) shocks to demand that constitute our econometric error (recall
that we include a full set of product fixed effects, which should absorb any omitted factors that are
constant over time). Moreover, the inclusion of time-since-entry dummies (discussed next) should
account for any tendency to advertise more intensely during the initial introduction phase. Note
that we do not attempt to solve for new advertising trajectories when performing counterfactuals.
Third, we include a set of time-since-entry dummy variables for each of the first twelve months
after product entry, which may capture product availability or aspects of consumer awareness.
The coefficients on the time dummies and on cumulative advertising are allowed to vary by class.
Generics gain market share in the first several months after patent-expiration. These time-sinceentry variables are an attempt to account for this stylized fact, which has been documented in
several empirical studies.29
Finally, in addition to the time-varying product characteristics, we also include product-level
fixed effects, where a product is defined at the manufacturer-molecule-form level.

3.5

Estimation

Our estimation procedure closely follows the algorithm proposed by Berry (1994) and further
developed by Berry et al. (1995). A key econometric issue is the endogeneity of price, which will be
correlated with the structural error ξjt via the strategic price-setting process employed by the firms.
This endogeneity is controlled for using instrumental variables, an approach which first extracts ξjt
29

It is possible that these time dummies are accounting for learning effects as in Ching (2010b).

19

from the (nonlinear) share equation (6) by inverting the shares and solving for the mean utilities
(δjt ’s) using a contraction mapping similar to that of Berry et al. (1995). Denote the mean utilities
computed by this inversion as δ (s, ρ) , a function of the observed market shares and the non-linear
parameters that index the GEV distribution (the remaining linear parameters are packed within
the mean utilities). We can then compute ξjt as

ξjt = δjt (st , ρ) − αpcjt + Xjt β + ζj ,

(9)

Exploiting an orthogonality condition between the structural error and a vector of suitable
instruments, Zjt , estimation proceeds using the standard Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
criterion function given by
min : ξ 0 ZW −1 Z 0 ξ,

ρ,α,β

(10)

in which W is the appropriate weighting matrix.
Identifying suitable instruments is difficult for discrete choice demand systems as the usual
supply side candidates (e.g., cost shifters) tend not to vary by product. We follow Bresnahan et al.
(1997), Berry et al. (1995), and the majority of the empirical industrial organization literature in
using instruments that exploit the (assumed) exogeneity of the X’s and the induced variation in
markups implied by each product’s relative isolation in product space (often called “Bresnahan
style” instruments after Bresnahan (1981, 1987)).30 Here we use the number of competitors in
particular categories to capture this source of exogenous variation. In particular, we use: the
number of molecules for the same form, number of molecules of the same form in the same class,
whether generics are present in the same form, whether generics are present in the same molecule,
number of generics present of the same molecule, number of generics present of the same form, and
number of generics present of the same form in the same class.

4

Supply
Consistent estimation of the demand system does not require a supply side, but performing

counterfactuals does, because we will need to predict how prices change when products are added
or deleted from the market.31 We follow the convention of the empirical industrial organization
30

We explored various subsets of the instruments to ensure robustness. Another approach, employed by Hausman
(1996) and Nevo (2000, 2001), uses prices of the product in other (geographically separate) submarkets as instruments.
Because our data are drawn from a single (national) market, we cannot use this strategy.
31
We assume Bertrand (price) competition rather than Cournot (capacity) competition because branded manufacturers do not have binding capacity constraints. Typically branded manufacturers have excess capacity because of
the high opportunity cost of lost sales. However, generic manufacturers, especially manufacturers of generic sterile
injectables, do sometimes face capacity constraints. This is evident in the fact that nearly all drug shortages are for
injectable generic drugs (Woodcock and Wosinska, 2012). Injectable drugs are not relevant for our analysis, because
we focus on oral solid forms (tablets and capsules) that comprise the vast majority of prescriptions in the antiulcer
market.

literature in assuming a static, multi-product Nash equilibrium in prices.32 Using the first order
conditions from this pricing game, we can find the implied marginal costs and associated measures
of market power (for example, markups and price-cost margins). We closely follow the notation of
Nevo (2000) in what follows.
Each firm f produces a subset, Ff , of the j = 1, . . . , J different products in a specific period.

where Ω is a J × J matrix. In vector notation, the first order conditions can be written as
s(p) − Ω · (p − mc) = 0

(14)

Assuming Ω is non-singular, marginal costs are then given by
mc = p − Ω−1 s(p).

(15)

Implied markups and price-cost margins follow directly. The recovered marginal costs can be
projected onto additional covariates to model their evolution over time and across products, but
32

We follow the majority of the empirical IO literature in treating the supply side as a static, Nash-in-prices,
stage game. This approach facilitates the computation of counterfactuals and mirrors a large empirical literature
on differentiated products, but does ignore some potentially important dynamics that could arise from consumer
switching costs or strong brand loyalty. If firms are able to influence these costs or exploit this loyalty through their
pricing decisions, a static supply side would ignore these incentives. In fact, there is evidence that pharmaceutical
firms will sometimes price a new product quite low (leaving the price of the old version high) in combination with a
strong advertising campaign to direct patients to the new product (e.g. AstraZenaca’s marketing of Nexium). Note
that this would not impact our demand side estimates, so long as consumers remain myopic, but could impact the
results of our counterfactuals.
33
Note that the firm chooses price which then gets translated into copayment according to pcj = exp(φ0 )pφj 1 (see
equation (8)). While it is the copayment that is relevant for calculating consumer demand, revenues are given by
price (rather than copayment) times the quantity demanded.

21

we must first address the role of manufacturer rebates.

4.1

Rebates

Another complication that arises in the context of pharmaceutical competition is the extensive
use of rebates paid by the manufacturer to the insurer. As noted earlier, we have a good measure
of rebate levels prior to generic entry but do not observe them thereafter. We now propose a simple
model to estimate rebate levels after generic entry, which again exploits our assumed model of
conduct and the first order conditions that determine optimal prices.
Consider a single product branded firm producing product j. With the firm choosing pjt at
time t, its profit maximization problem reduces to:
max(pjt − mcjt )sjt (p)

(16)

pjt

where p includes j’s price as well as competitor prices.
To incorporate rebates, let rjt denote the time-t rebate’s proportion of the price, the firm’s
problem changes to:
max((1 − rjt )pjt − mcjt )sjt (p)

(17)

pjt

with first order condition given by:
0 = (1 − rjt )sjt (p) + ((1 − rjt )pjt − mcjt )

∂sjt (p)
∂pjt

(18)

Let τjt be time since entry and let g and h be flexible functions of time and time since entry,
respectively. We specify marginal costs as:
mcjt = γj + g(t) + h(τjt ) + εjt ,

(19)

where γj is a product fixed effect and εjt is white noise. The flexible function of time, g(t), captures
differences in input prices that affect everyone. The flexible function of time since entry, h(τjt ),
allows for learning by doing.34 In practice, we use monthly indicator variables for time and time
since entry, stopping the latter after 36 months.
We assume that all firms charge the same rebate prior to generic entry (assumed to equal
15.1%), and adjust immediately to a new common rebate upon generic entry. Denote the firm’s
rebate level before generic entry by rP RE . We want to obtain rP OST . For periods before generic
entry, we can express known variables (pjt , sjt (p), ∂sjt (p)/∂pjt , rP RE ) as a function of marginal
costs:

where we expect π > 0, implying rebates are bigger in the post-period.35

Results
Key demand-side parameter estimates are presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5. Table 3 contains the

parameter estimates that link copayment to price. The coefficients show copayment increases with
price, but at a diminishing rate. We then use these parameters to form copayments for all periods
in the data, taking into account the adjustments outlined in section 3.2.
The non-linear, or nesting, parameters, which drive cross-product substitution, are presented
in Table 4. The molecule nesting parameter converged to the set lower limit of 0.05, while the

Some pharmaceutical manufacturers increase rebates to slow falling sales from generic competition. For example,
“In the face of sudden generic discounts, Pfizer seems to have given a lot of rebates to keep Lipitor on insurance
company formularies,” according to Matthew Herper writing in Forbes in May 2012.

other nesting parameters did not. This indicates that drugs of the same molecule are very good
substitutes, i.e. consumers are particularly resistant to switch from their preferred molecule. For
example, if generic omeprazole capsules are removed from the market, a consumer who buys generic
omeprazole capsules is more inclined to switch to the branded or tablet versions of their preferred
drug than to generic capsules of a different molecule. The other nesting parameters range from
0.54 to 0.72, reflecting a correlation across products with similar characteristics that is strongest
along the form dimension and weakest along the brand/generic dimension, which indicates that
consumers are more particular with regards to their preferred form than with regards to a drug’s
class or brand/generic status. The fact that most of our estimated substitution parameters do not
converge to a boundary helps justify our flexible framework because imposing either of the possible
extreme assumptions (i.e. perfect substitutes or non-substitutes) would have prevented us from
explaining regularities in the data.
Table 5 presents selected linear parameters. The price and advertising coefficients indicate – not
surprisingly – that consumers buy products with low prices and heavy advertising, all else equal.
Advertising has slightly less impact for PPIs, perhaps because H2 advertising has already made
consumers aware of the availability of antiulcer drugs. The time-since-entry coefficients suggest
new products can take a year to gain traction. PPIs are particularly slow in the first month, but
are much like H2s later. Finally, generic drugs facing over-the-counter competition in the same
molecule see lower demand. This is not true for branded drugs indicating that over-the-counter
drugs are seen as better substitutes for generics.

5.1

Elasticities

A strength of the Bresnahan et al. (1997) estimation approach is it accommodates flexible
substitution patterns. Tables 6 and 7 present own and cross-price elasticities. Table 6 is for the
last period in our data (December, 2010) and Table 7 is for an earlier period (December, 2005).
The columns associated with each drug report how its market share responds to price changes by
each alternative. We report results for all branded drugs, as well as for the most popular generic
version of each molecule. Consistent with economic theory, all own-price elasticities are less than
negative one.36 Own-price elasticities are also substantially higher for generics, reflecting the more
competitive nature of the generic portion of the market.
The most interesting patterns are revealed by the set of cross-price elasticities. In particular, the
cross-substitution effects are strongest for alternative drug therapies that share class, brand/generic
status, form, or molecule; they are also stronger from products with high shares. Consider lansoprazole, which has two branded forms (capsule and tablet) as well as a generic option. The
two branded forms have limited effects on each other, primarily because they are small players.
Changes in the price of generic pantoprazole, which is a tablet, has a substantial effect on branded
36

In contrast, before correcting prices for the role of copayments, we found that the majority of firms were pricing
on the inelastic portion of the demand curve.

25

lansoprazole tablets, with a cross-price elasticity of 0.69, while the cross-price elasticity for branded
lansoprazole capsules is only 0.10. Generic lansoprazole (a capsule) likewise has asymmetric effects
on the two forms of branded lansoprazole. If we consider the earlier period in Table 7, generic lansoprazole is not present and branded lansoprazole capsules has a much larger share of the market
than in Table 6. Consequently, changing prices for branded lansoprazole capsules results in much
larger cross-price elasticities in Table 7 than in Table 6.
Pantoprazole is the only PPI with relatively large shares of tablets. This combined with the
presence of few generic pantoprazole manufacturers results in an enormous impact of price changes
by the leading generic pantoprazole manufacturer on the market share of branded pantoprazole.
The effects are again not symmetric, as branded pantoprazole has significantly fewer sales than
its generic counterpart. Further illustrating the importance of the size among similar drugs, price
changes by esomeprazole (the leading branded drug), have large effects on the shares of other
branded molecules. This effect is particularly strong for those molecules with a generic competitor,
in which case branded manufacturers compete almost exclusively for patients who strongly prefer
branded drugs.

Marginal Costs and Rebates

Having estimated our model of consumer behavior, we can now use our model of price-setting to
recover marginal costs. Recall branded drug manufacturers provide rebates to insurance companies
that may change once a generic of the same molecule enters the market. Illustrating how ignoring
rebates leads to implausible marginal cost implications, Figure 6 plots implied marginal costs for
pantoprazole as a function of months since generic entry. There is little reason to expect the sharp
jump in production costs (shown by the vertical segment of the graph) once the first generic enters
the market. Examining other molecules reveals similar patterns.
The jumps are driven by the relatively muted price response of branded drugs to generic competition. Recall how quickly branded firms lost share to generic producers upon generic entry. Once
generic competition is present, we would have expected branded drug prices to drop, all else equal.
But branded prices show little response to generic competition. Hence, absent rebate adjustments,
the model “rationalizes” the lack of a price response by a substantial increase in marginal costs.
As described in section 4.1, our model of rebate adjustment allows firms to respond to the
increase in competition through this channel as well. In practice, we estimate equation (21) using
data from single product branded firms where we see a generic entrant and generic firms producing
those same molecules. The set of molecules satisfying these restrictions are cimetidine, famotidine,
nizatidine, and pantoprazole. In effect, we are exploiting an assumed common temporal pattern in
the adjustment of marginal costs across branded and generic manufacturers to pin down the more
discrete adjustment in the rebate level implied by optimal pricing behavior.
Table 8 presents supply-side results. Relative to cimetidine, famotidine has lower marginal costs
while nizatidine and pantoprazole have higher marginal costs. The marginal cost for nizatidine is
particularly high, reflecting its status as the only capsule among the four molecules. Branded
molecules have significantly higher marginal costs. The (market-share-weighted) average marginal
cost for generic molecules in the last period of the data was $28.25. Hence, the $23.65 additional
cost for branded drugs is a substantial premium. For the counterfactual policy simulations, the key
parameter is the post-generic rebate. Our estimates suggest average branded drug rebates increase
from 15.1% to 48.3% once a generic version enters the market.
Are our post-generic rebate estimates reasonable? While rebates are not publicly available,
we can do a “back-of-the-envelope” estimate of rebates and compare it to our results. Companies
publish revenue net of rebates in their annual reports. Some companies even break out the net
revenue by company and drug. In those cases, we can compare the net revenue to sales data.
However, our sales data include only retail sales and omit hospital sales. Hence, we obtained
another data set that includes annual data on both hospital and retail sales, albeit for fewer years.
By subtracting a company’s reported net revenue from total sales, we can estimate rebates. We
were able to find net revenue in company annual reports for two of the three PPIs in our sample
facing generic competition.37

We did not find data for lansoprazole which was sold by a Japanese firm in an alliance with a U.S. firm.

Reference molecule is cimetidine.

Omeprazole faced generic competition beginning in November 2002. In 2002, the difference
between our sales data and the company reported net revenue for omeprazole sales in the U.S. was
18%. In 2003, the difference rose to 44%. This increase is consistent with an increase in rebates
following generic entry. Likewise, pantoprazole faced generic competition beginning in December
2007. In 2007, the difference between our sales data and the company reported net revenue was
22%. In 2008, the difference rose to 36%. Similarly, this increase is also consistent with an increase
in rebates following generic entry.
The estimates also suggest significant learning by doing or economies of scale/scope. Marginal
costs fall substantially over three years. Indeed, generic and branded manufacturers actually have
similar marginal costs for the first few months after generic entry. The cost advantage of generics
comes later. These results were forecast in Figure 3, which reveals that generic prices continue to
drop over time. While this could have been caused by increased generic competition, our results
indicate a significant portion of the drop is due to falling marginal costs. While it is not possible
to identify the source of these economies, they could reflect either learning by doing or scale/scope
economies on the part of the generic producers. In particular, as the generic market for a particular molecule expands, the generic producer might switch production from an older, higher cost,
production facility to a newer one. Alternatively, they might instead reflect increasing access to
efficient distribution channels (e.g. high volume pharmacies) that take time to establish. Khanna
et al. (2010) note that “Teva reported unit-cost reductions of 30% in 2001-2005 due primarily to
scale effects”. As their relationships with large chain pharmacies have expanded, Teva has invested
in advanced information systems and automated distribution, streamlining operations and driving
down their cost per pill (Singer, 2010).

Counterfactuals

6.1

Value of Eliminating Pharmaceutical Followers

We can now combine our supply- and demand-side estimates to calculate how equilibrium prices
and shares will change under various hypothetical scenarios. We begin by considering three such
counterfactuals: (1) no generics, (2) no me-too molecules (only the first in class), and (3) no PPIs.38
Table 9 lists shares for all molecule-brand/generic combinations in December 2010 for the base case
and for the three counterfactuals. In each of the counterfactuals, products are removed, and we
consider both the effect when prices adjust and when prices do not adjust. This allows us to
differentiate between the price and variety effects.
For each counterfactual, we assume the number of manufacturers is fixed for each of the
molecule-brand/generic combinations that are not removed, so that the remaining manufacturers neither enter nor exit. For example, even when generics are removed, we assume that branded
drugs that previously exited (branded cimetidine and nizatidine) do not return. We also ran the
simulations with those manufacturers returning, but it did not change our results because these
were relatively low-quality drugs and would have garnered low market shares regardless of the
policy regime.
Removing generic competition cuts the total number of prescriptions by over half. The H2
market, which is dominated by generics, falls to less than one twentieth of its original size. If
branded manufacturers did not raise their prices in response to generic exit, then their share would
rise from 4.8 to 7.8 percent. With branded manufacturers able to raise price, branded share rises
to 7.0 percent instead.
Removing me-too molecules causes an even larger drop in utilization than removing generics.
Removing me-toos increases the share of generic omeprazole. However, utilization falls slightly for
generic PPIs as a a whole, and falls substantially for generic H2s and branded PPIs. When PPIs
are removed from the market, utilization falls about 80%. While generic H2s increase their share
by close to a percentage point, this is small compared to the 12 percentage point drop in share
purchasing any drug.
The large drops in utilization when generics, me-too molecules, or PPIs are removed might seem
dramatic. However, the results make sense given the evolution of the market. As shown in Figure
1, PPIs dramatically expanded the prescription market, suggesting H2s are not particularly good
substitutes for PPIs. Further, at the end of our sample period many of the H2s and some of the
PPIs were available over-the-counter. In this sense, we may be underestimating the importance of
me-too molecules and PPIs due to the accrued benefits once the drug can be obtained without a
prescription.
Using the coefficient on copayment from the demand-side estimation and the formulas for ex38
Note that when we remove generics we turn off the brandXgeneric competition variable in Table 5 which adjusted
for how copayments for branded drugs are affected by generic competition.

pected utility in a GEV model, we can calculate welfare changes for our counterfactuals. For the
counterfactuals, we hold insurance premiums fixed. Given our outside good assumption, consumer
surplus changes moving from regime r to r0 can be expressed as differences in the log probabilities of
choosing the outside good in the two regimes divided by the coefficient on copayment (Arcidiacono
and Miller, 2011):
∆E(CS) =

ln(s0r ) − ln(s0r0 )
α

We express consumer surplus changes in annual terms, taking twelve times the expected individual
change and multiplying by the number of afflicted people. Table 10 gives annual spending by
insurers, spending by consumers on copayments, variable costs, and profits gross of fixed costs.39
If generics are removed, prescriptions fall by over 50%, yet total revenue increases. Revenue
increases because the price per prescription increases. Also, without competition from generics,
rebates fall. Profit (gross of fixed cost) increases by $1.4 billion. Consumer welfare falls $125
million. Copayments drop because of the fall in prescriptions, but total insurance spending rises
because of the increase in price per prescription.
If me-too drugs are removed, annual drug manufacturer profit falls from over $4.5 billion to
$354 million. Profit is low because there are fewer drugs, and all remaining drugs face generic com-

petition. Insurance spending falls by $7 billion. Holding insurance premiums constant, consumer
welfare loss is $135 million. The consumer welfare loss is small relative to the insurer gains. Some
of these gains to insurers could be passed to consumers in lower premiums, higher wages (due to
savings in employer-provided insurance), and lower taxes (due to savings in government insurance
programs).40

39

Profits gross of fixed costs refers to revenues from insurance companies and consumers minus variable costs. Note
that the revenues from insurance companies are net of rebates.
40
We can compare the counterfactual estimates from Table 10 to the plot of prescriptions from Figure 2. In the
base case from Table 10, revenue from H2s and PPIs is over $9 billion in 2010. In Figure 2 in 2010, brand PPI
prescriptions are 3 million per month multiplied by $200 per prescription and 12 months per year or over $7 billion.
Generic PPI prescriptions are 5 million per month multiplied by $40 per prescription and 12 months per year or
over $2 billion. Revenue from H2s in 2010 is negligible because prescriptions and prices are much smaller than PPIs.
Hence, the $9 billion from Table 10 is consistent with Figure 2 if we convert from monthly to annual and multiply
by price.

The short run differs from the long run because of falling marginal costs and rising perceived quality for generic
esomeprazole.

6.2

Forecasting Generic Esomeprazole

Our next set of counterfactuals examine how the entry of generic manufacturers of esomeprazole affects equilibrium prices, shares, and welfare. We focus on esomeprazole —Nexium, the
quintessential me-too drug — because it is one of the top-selling drugs of all time and faces generic
competition beginning in 2014.
In the long run (greater than 3 years), generics have been on the market sufficiently long so
that their perceived quality and marginal costs have stabilized. To perform this counterfactual, we
set the quality and marginal cost for generic esomeprazole. Marginal cost for generic esomeprazole
is set to $23.65 less than branded esomeprazole, corresponding to estimates in Table 8. For quality,
we looked at differences in branded and generic quality for PPIs that faced generic competition,
using the median difference.41 The same quality and marginal cost parameters are used for each of
the generics for the cases in which there is more than one generic entrant. The results are reported
in Table 11.
Entry of the first generic has little effect on long-run consumer welfare. This occurs for two
41

If we instead used the average difference in quality between all branded drugs (H2’s and PPI’s) our estimated
consumer welfare gains and generic shares would be even higher, with generic shares rising up to 25%. This would
suggest our estimates are lower bounds. However, the outside option may also improve as more drugs move to over
the counter. To the extent the outside option improves, we will be over-estimating the effects of generic esomeprazole.

36

reasons. First, branded esomeprazole must now pay large rebates to the insurers, making it less
competitive. Branded prices rise, both because of the increase in the rebate paid and because
of incentives for the branded manufacturer to focus on customers who strongly prefer branded
drugs. Second, without other generic competitors of the same molecule, the remaining generic
esomeprazole is sufficiently differentiated that it can set a higher price. Total utilization changes
only slightly with the addition of the first generic.
Adding another generic has a substantial effect on consumer welfare, primarily due to price
competition between the generics, as generic prices fall by half. The price cut results in tripling
of generic esomeprazole prescriptions. The annualized consumer welfare change is more than $100
million. Gains from additional generic entries are smaller, in part because a single generic provides
sufficient price competition. Adding more generics has little effect on prices.
The second panel shows results in the short-run case where generic esomeprazole has been on
the market for three months, implying a lower perceived quality (Table 5) and higher marginal
costs (Table 8). The results for the short-run case are very different from the long-run case. Here,
the decreased generic quality and higher marginal cost means that branded esomeprazole is a closer
substitute. Hence, the addition of a generic entrant increases welfare more in the short run than
the long run. When there is only one generic, the increased branded competition results in a lower
generic price (relative to the case of one generic in the long run). Additional generics beyond
the first have smaller marginal welfare effects, as the market was reasonably competitive when
there was only one generic entrant. When multiple generic manufacturers are present, the branded
manufacturer stops trying to compete and raises its price to focus on consumers with a strong taste
for the branded product. With multiple generics, the branded price rises and its market share falls.

Conclusion
We estimate the demand and supply of antiulcer drugs, accommodating rich substitution pat-

terns across classes, brand/generic status, forms, and molecules. We deal with two challenges
caused by insurance. First, the prices we see in the data are not the prices paid by consumers due
to insurance subsidies. Second, firm revenues are distorted because firms pay sizable rebates to
insurance companies.
The estimates of the demand and supply models allow us to perform two sets of counterfactuals.
First, we show consumer welfare losses and changes in insurance payments and profits when drugs
are removed from the market. Removing generics or me-too drugs leads to annual losses of consumer
welfare of $125 and $135 million dollars respectively, holding insurance premiums constant. The
changes in insurance payments and firm profits are more dramatic. While removing generics would
increase insurance payments by a billion dollars annually, removing me-too drugs would decrease
insurance payments by over $7 billion dollars annually.
Although me-too drug Nexium (esomeprazole) increased insurance spending by tens of billions

37

of dollars since 2001, it will be available as a generic in 2014. We examine generic esomeprazole in
our second set of counterfactuals. We find that generic esomeprazole will expand utilization in the
class after enough generic manufacturers enter, with annual consumer welfare gains of over $100
million.
While me-too drugs provide price competition, we find that the net effect of me-too drugs is
to increase pharmaceutical spending, in part because of the added variety. This has implications
for health policy. First, the President’s proposed budget for 2013 includes speeding biosimilars
to market, but if biosimilars behave like these me-too drugs, they are likely to increase spending,
rather than decrease spending as the President predicts. Likewise, the priority review voucher
(Ridley et al., 2006) which speeds me-too drugs to market would be expected to increase spending.
Conversely, the Indian policy of not patenting me-too drugs like Glivec would decrease spending.
Of course, such effects on spending also have implications for innovation incentives which we leave
for future work.
