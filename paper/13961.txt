ABSTRACT
We provide evidence on how two important types of institutions -- dismissal barriers, and bonus pay
-- affect contract enforcement behavior in a market with incomplete contracts and repeated interactions.
Dismissal barriers are shown to have a strong negative impact on worker performance, and market
efficiency, by interfering with firms' use of firing threat as an incentive device. Dismissal barriers
also distort the dynamics of worker effort levels over time, cause firms to rely more on the spot market
for labor, and create a distribution of relationship lengths in the market that is more extreme, with
more very short and more very long relationships. The introduction of a bonus pay option dramatically
changes the market outcome. Firms are observed to substitute bonus pay for threat of firing as an incentive
device, almost entirely offsetting the negative incentive and efficiency effects of dismissal barriers.
Nevertheless, contract enforcement behavior remains fundamentally changed, because the option to
pay bonuses causes firms to rely less on long-term relationships. Our results show that market outcomes
are the result of a complex interplay between contract enforcement policies and the institutions in which
they are embedded.

Introduction

This paper uses experimental labor markets to study how two important, and often controversial, institutions  dismissal barriers, and bonus pay  aect contract enforcement
behavior. We focus on a setting with incomplete contracts as this is a ubiquitous characteristic of employment relationships.

1

We also allow for repeated interactions, because a

prominent theoretical solution to the contract enforcement problem associated with incompleteness involves employers and employees interacting in a repeated game. In particular,
the theory involves employers using a combination of rents and threat of dismissal to give
workers an incentive to perform (e.g., Klein and Leer (1981), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984)
and MacLeod and Malcomson (1989)).
Dismissal barriers are a particularly important institution to study in the context of incomplete contracts, given the strategic importance of ring threat in such settings. Dismissal
barriers have the potential to radically change the strategic interaction of rms and workers
within relationships, as well as patterns of relationship formation in the market. Dismissal
barriers arise, for example, in the presence of employment protection legislation (EPL),
where hiring a worker beyond a probation period triggers barriers to dismissal, or in the case
of relationship-specic investments that accrue over time and raise ring costs (see Mincer
(1962)).
The exibility of the labor contract is also a key institutional feature, in particular whether
rms are restricted to the wage contract focused on in the eciency wage literature, or
whether contractual instruments such as bonus pay or other forms of delayed compensation
are also available. Previous evidence indicates that bonus pay is a credible incentive device
in one-shot games, because rms reward performance with bonuses, and punish shirking by

withholding the bonus (Fehr, Gächter, and Kirchsteiger (1997); Fehr, Klein, and Schmidt
(2007)). The availability of bonus pay thus has the potential to fundamentally change rms'
contract enforcement policies in a repeated game setting. Furthermore, the availability of
bonus pay may be crucial for determining the impact of dismissal barriers, to the extent that
it provides rms with an alternative incentive device to threat of ring.
We begin by establishing a baseline condition (T-Baseline) in which there are no dismissal
barriers and no bonus pay. We use as our workhorse the experimental framework of Brown,
Falk, and Fehr (2004), in which rms and workers can endogenously form long-term relationships. Firms oer contracts involving a wage and a desired eort, and after accepting a
contract workers choose their eort level, which is unenforceable.
Despite the contract enforcement problem, eort levels in T-Baseline are on average quite
high.

High eorts are observed mainly in long-term relationships.

This reects a policy

of rms paying rents relative to unemployment, and credibly ring poor performers. These
ndings corroborate those of Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004), and show the central importance
of ring threat as an incentive device. This sets the stage for exploring our main research
questions.
We implement a second treatment (T-Barrier) in which there is a dismissal institution
present in the market, such that only the worker can end a relationship once the rm chooses
to hire the worker two times in a row. The rst time a rm hires a worker thus corresponds to
a probation period, in which ring is still possible. Firms are also restricted in their ability
to lower wages once they trigger dismissal protection by engaging in the second consecutive
contract, to rule out de facto dismissal by reducing wages to zero.

2

We predict three main eects of the dismissal barrier institution.

The rst is a nega-

tive incentive eect, due to removal of ring threat as an incentive.

Consistent with this

legal jurisdictions view the reduction of wages to zero as equivalent to ring a worker.

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

prediction, average eort levels in long-term relationships are far below those observed in
the baseline condition, which also leads to lower market eciency. A second prediction is
a probation period eect, such that worker eort is especially high in the probation period,
due to the added attractiveness of enticing rms into long-term relationships, and then drops
sharply once the worker is re-hired. Indeed, this pattern is pervasive in T-Barrier, whereas
in the baseline condition the opposite pattern is observed. The third prediction concerns a
set of related eects on relationship-formation: rms are predicted to be more reluctant to
enter relationships in a market with dismissal barriers, because of the incentive problem; the
prediction for turnover is ambiguous, because the tendency to engage in more one-shot interactions is potentially oset by the tendency for relationships that do form not to break up;
dismissal barriers are predicted to have a systematic eect on the shape of the distribution
for relationship lengths in the market, leading to more very short and also more very long
relationships. Observed behavior is supportive of all these relationship formation eects.
In a third treatment (T-Barrier-Bonus) we implement both dismissal barriers and the
option for rms to oer contractually non-enforceable bonuses as part of the initial contract.
After observing worker performance, rms can decide how much of a bonus to actually pay.
The impact of dismissal barriers is dramatically altered by the presence of bonus pay.
Firms credibly reward worker performance by paying bonuses, and this additional incentive
device essentially eliminates the problem of worker shirking in long-term relationships, despite the absence of ring threat. Market eciency is also substantially improved, and the
probation period eect on eort dynamics disappears. Relationship formation remains signicantly dierent from baseline, however, with rms being less prone to enter relationships,
despite the fact that worker performance in long-term relationships is no worse than in the
baseline condition. One potential explanation for this latter nding is that bonus pay causes

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

4

rms to rely less on relational incentives in general, because bonus pay and relationships act
as substitute incentive devices. This latter explanation cannot be veried without introducing a fourth treatment, where there is bonus pay but no confounding eect of a dismissal
institution.
We briey investigate behavior in such a treatment (T-Bonus).

Firms are much less

prone to initiate long-term relationships when bonus pay is available, compared to the case
where there is no bonus pay, indicating that bonus pay and relational incentives are in
fact substitutes. Interestingly, T-Bonus also shows that in the absence of dismissal barriers
bonus pay does not have a strong advantage over wage contracts as a way of eliciting worker
performance.

In the absence of dismissal barriers, the additional option to pay bonuses

improves market eciency only marginally compared to a case (T-Baseline) where rms
must rely on the combination of wages and ring threat.
Taken together, the ndings shed light on how enforcement behavior interacts with the
surrounding institutional environment. The negative incentive eect of dismissal barriers depends on the exibility of the contracting technology, but while introducing contractual exibility reduces negative eciency consequences, in other ways contract enforcement strategies
are left fundamentally changed. Though institutions impose constraints on contract enforcement strategies, agents are not passive, but respond by nding dierent avenues for solving
incentive problems.

In other words, understanding strategic interactions within rms re-

quires an appreciation of the institutions in which contractual relations are embedded, and
at the same time, understanding the impact of institutions requires an appreciation of how
they interact with details of rms' contract enforcement strategies.
Substantial progress has been made in previous theoretical work on the interplay of contract enforcement and institutions, in settings with repeated interactions. Beginning with

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

5

Telser (1980), there have been a number of contributions that use repeated game theory
to model the enforcement of incomplete contracts.

Klein and Leer (1981), Shapiro and

Stiglitz (1984) and Bowles (1985) show that the use of a high wage with the threat of ring
can ensure performance. Bull (1987) and MacLeod and Malcomson (1989) introduce bonus
pay to the model, and show that a similar result holds, while Levin (2003) extends these
models to allow for asymmetric information in addition to contract incompleteness. These
papers restrict attention to the case of risk neutral agents, for which bonus pay does not typically play a substantive role in ensuring eciency. Rather, in the spirit of the folk theorem
(Fudenberg and Maskin (1986)), there are many possible ecient equilibria. What bonus

3
pay does is aect the distribution of the surplus between the worker and the rm.
MacLeod and Malcomson (1998) show, in contrast, how the division of surplus can have
eciency consequences, depending upon the relative supply of workers and capital. In particular, when capital is in short supply, then it is ecient to have it fully utilized, which is
possible under an eciency wage contract, but not under a bonus pay contract. Our experimental market corresponds to the case of a shortage of capital, given that the number of jobs
is always less than the number of workers. Thus, the theory predicts that the equilibrium
with eciency wage contracts should be much more ecient, whereas we nd that both wage
contracts and bonus contracts yield similar performance (in the absence of barriers).
There are a number of reasons why standard theory does not explain our results. First,
it is assumed that agents are innitely lived, while in practice and in our experiments all
relationships are necessarily of nite duration. Without additional assumptions, all of these
theories predict a dismal level of minimum eciency in all of our treatments, due to standard

3Baker,

Gibbons, and Murphy (1994) show that bonus pay has an important impact on surplus when the
rm also has available objective measures of performance. Pearce and Stacchetti (1998) extend these results
to the case of risk averse agents.

backwards induction arguments. From previous experimental evidence on contract enforcement behavior (e.g., Fehr, Kirchsteiger, and Riedl (1993); Fehr and Falk (1999)), however,
it is known that in practice non-minimal eciency is typically achieved even in one-shot interactions with incomplete contracts. Beginning with Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts, and Wilson
(1982), it is well know that such behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that individuals
have social preferences that incorporate factors other than the pecuniary returns from a
decision.

The diculty is that we do not have an established model of these preferences,

and hence as Fehr, Klein, and Schmidt (2007) observe, it is necessary to use experimental
evidence to uncover how specic institutions will work with human subjects.
There are previous experimental studies on contract enforcement behavior, but to our
knowledge none on the important topic of how dismissal barriers aect contract enforcement, or on how the impact of dismissal barriers depends on other institutional features,
such as availability of bonus pay. This is partly because until recently experimental studies
have focused almost exclusively on static settings, whereas studying the incentive eects of

4
dismissal barriers requires a setting with repeated interactions by its very nature. Although
the focus of our paper is on the interaction of dismissal barriers and bonus pay, our results
also complement the experimental literature studying the question of how bonus contracts
perform relative to wage contracts. Fehr, Gächter, and Kirchsteiger (1997) and Fehr, Klein,
and Schmidt (2007) nd that bonus contracts perform much better than wage contracts in
terms of eciency, in one-shot interactions.

Our results qualify these ndings somewhat,

showing that in a repeated game setting bonus contracts perform only slightly better than
wage contracts, with the dierence narrowing over time. The key dierence is that in repeated game settings rms can combine wage contracts with threat of ring, whereas in

4Wu

and Roe (2007) also use the repeated-interaction framework of Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004), but focus
on varying the degree of incompleteness in contracts.

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

one-shot games worker performance under a wage contract depends solely on altruistic or
reciprocal motives of the worker. On the other hand, our ndings show that bonus pay does
have large benets relative to wage contracts, even in repeated game settings, if there are
some barriers to dismissal in the market.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the experiment, and Section 3 outlines predictions for behavior. Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 concludes.

The Experiment

2.1. Design. The labor market operated for 18 trading periods. In each period a rm could
hire at most one worker, and a worker could have at most one job. An individual period
involved two or three phases, depending on the treatment.

The rst phase was always a

market phase, in which the rms made contract oers and workers could only accept or
reject. Firms could make as many contract oers as they wanted during the time limit of
three minutes; if one of a rm's contracts was accepted, all of the other oers by that rm
were immediately removed from the market.

5

In the case that a rm and a worker agreed on

a contract, they entered a second phase in which the worker could decide how much eort,

e

to exert. In treatments where the contract oer could include an oered bonus, there was a
third phase in which the rm was informed about the worker's eort choice and could decide
how much of a bonus,

b,

to pay. Importantly, neither the worker's eort level or the rm's

bonus payment were restricted by the initial contract agreement, whereas a wage specied
in the agreement was binding.

After the second (third) phase, the rm and worker were

informed about their prots and earnings, respectively, and then a new period began.

5If

all rms had contracts, there was no potential for further trades. Thus, the market phase was designed to
end automatically after three minutes, or after the last rm had a contract oer accepted, whichever came
rst.

The oer also included the rm's ID number. Firms could make two

types of contract oers during the market phase: public oers or private oers. Public oers
were observed by all workers, and thus could be accepted by any worker.

Private oers

were observed only by a worker specied by the rm, and thus were available only to that
particular worker. In the case that a rm made a private oer, the rm specied a worker's ID
number, in addition to the contract terms. Worker and rm ID numbers remained constant
over the entire 18 periods, so it was possible for a rm to intentionally make a private oer
to the same worker over multiple periods, and for a worker to recognize oers coming from
a specic rm. This design made it possible for a rm and worker to endogenously form a
long-term relationship, by choosing to repeatedly engage in private-oer contracts with each
other over multiple periods. Public oers were a way for rms to engage in a spot market
for labor rather than engaging in long-term relationships. During the market phase, rms
were kept constantly informed about which workers had already accepted a contract, so as
to avoid having rms make a private oer to a worker that was no longer available.
In treatments with the dismissal barrier institution, a rm lost the ability to re a worker
in the case that in two consecutive periods the worker had accepted a private oer from
that rm. In other words, if a worker accepted a private oer from a rm in period
then accepted a second private oer from the same rm in period

t,

and

t + 1, the dismissal barrier

took eect and only the worker could then end the relationship. In our experiment we thus
eectively set the cost of ring to innity. Disallowing ring, as opposed to introducing an
additional parameter capturing a nite cost of ring, has the advantage of simplifying an
already complex choice situation.

It also provides a particularly tough test of the ability

of bonus pay to overcome the eects of dismissal barriers.

The fact that the dismissal

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

9

barrier was activated only with the second consecutive contract captures a common feature
of EPL institutions, which is an initial probation period, during which the rm is still able
to re the worker. It also has an analogue in situations where there are relationship-specic
investments that increase ring costs, but where investments are made only after an initial
probation period.
Having chosen to hire the worker again, after the initial private oer, the dismissal barrier
took eect and the rm had to make an oer to that same worker at the beginning of each
subsequent period until the end of the game or until the worker decided to reject the rm's
oer. Firms who had chosen to trigger the dismissal barrier made subsequent oers to the
same worker in a special phase before the market phase.

Importantly, once the dismissal

barrier was activated, the wage oer had to be at least as high as in the previous period. Some
rigidity of the wage is required for a dismissal protection institution to work, otherwise a rm
could eectively re a worker by reducing the wage to zero.

6

After rms had made their oers

required by the dismissal barrier institution, the market period began and workers protected
by the dismissal barrier could see the standing oer from their own rm, in addition to the
other market activity.

At any time, the worker could accept the standing oer, in which

case the rm was informed.

Alternatively, the worker could reject the oer by accepting

another contract in the market. As soon as the worker rejected the standing oer, the rm
was informed, and allowed to make oers during the remainder of the market phase.
In our design the eort cost function for workers, described below, is the same across
all individuals so there are no dierences in ability. This allows us to focus on the moral
hazard problem in terms of eort and bonus payment, without the complication of adverse
selection in terms of ability. We also do not implement cyclical shocks to market conditions,

or worker redundancies (multiple workers at one rm). This simplies an already complex
inter-temporal choice environment, and makes it possible to rst understand the impact of
dismissal barriers on the strategic behavior surrounding the contract enforcement problem.
We implemented four treatments, as summarized in Table 1.

had the same form, but we introduced our dismissal barrier institution. In T-Barrier-Bonus,

Payo functions for workers and rms, including the eort cost function, were common

Participants were aware that the market would last 18 periods.

Reputations

could form bi-laterally: rms learned about the eort choices of workers that they traded
with, but did not observe eort choices or bonus decisions, in interactions that they were
not a part of; workers learned about the bonus decisions of rms that they encountered, but
not about worker eort choices or rm bonus decisions in other market interactions. Firms
observed all public oers on the market during the market phase. Workers were informed not
only about private oers they had received, but also about all public oers on the market.
The experiment was computerized using Z-Tree software (Fischbacher (2007)). There was
an unpaid practice period before the experiment began, which consisted only of a market
phase but not the subsequent eort or bonus phases, to give subjects experience with the
process of making and accepting oers. After the practice period, the rst period of the paid
experiment began. At the end of each period, a subject's period prots were summarized,

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT
along with the prots of the trading partner in the case of a trade.

12
Subjects were also

reminded of the partner's ID number, the terms of the initial contract, the actual eort
choice, and the actual bonus paid.

Subjects could record this information on a separate

sheet of paper, ensuring that subjects were fully informed about their own trading history
over the course of the experiment. The experiment was framed neutrally, in terms of buyers
and sellers rather than workers and rms. Eort was referred to as quality. This facilitates
comparison with Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004). who used the same neutral framing. Fehr,
Klein, and Schmidt (2007) show, however, that whether one uses framing as buyers and
sellers, or workers and rms, is irrelevant for behavior in this class of experimental market
settings. Representative instructions are provided in an appendix at the end of the paper.
There were 408 participants in the experiment (see Table 1). We conducted six market
sessions for each of the four treatments, for a total of twenty-four sessions. Subjects were
students at the University of Bonn, from various elds of study.

No subject participated

in more than one session. On average, a session lasted roughly 100 minutes, and a subject
earned 25 Euros (approximately 32 USD).

Predictions

If it is common knowledge that workers and rms are motivated only by their own material
payos, then the prediction for behavior in T-Baseline involves a very inecient outcome.
Workers will choose

e=1

in the nal period, regardless of the agreed-upon contract

{w, ee}.

Firms will nd it optimal in the nal period to oer wages that just compensate the worker
for the outside option. All seven contract oers will be accepted. By backward induction,
the same outcome will be realized in all previous periods, with the small surplus generated
by the workers' minimal eort being claimed entirely by the rms.

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

13

If material self-interest of rms and workers is not common knowledge, however, predictions change dramatically. Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004) show theoretically that a sucient
number of fair-minded subjects, who respond to generous wages with high eort even in the
absence of strategic incentives to do so, is sucient to sustain an equilibrium in which all
workers provide high eort levels in early market periods, and only the fair workers provide
non-minimal eort in the nal market period. The key mechanism for eliciting high eort
from selsh workers (selsh in the sense of caring only about own material payos) is the
existence of a rent in the nal period, which arises because the presence of some fair workers
makes it protable (and therefore credible) for rms to pay generous wages even when there
is no prospect for future interactions.

The possibility of a future rent, and the threat of

ring, discipline even selsh workers in the second-to-last period. Because only the future
rent matters for selsh workers' incentives, rms could be expected to pay a low or zero rent
in period 17. Given the plausible belief that the lack of a rent in the current period signals
that a rm will not pay a rent in the future, however, rms will have an incentive to pay a
rent even in this period.
MacLeod (2007) observes that the key feature in this argument is the existence of some rent
in the last period, which may also be generated by individuals who have taste for performing
as promised. This implies that in the second to last period, regardless of one's type, there
will be a gain from continuing the relationship. MacLeod (2007) shows that a backwards
induction argument implies that one very quickly obtains performance that is close to the
rst best in earlier periods.
These observations lead to several qualitative predictions for contract enforcement behavior in T-Baseline. Firms are predicted to trade repeatedly with the same worker if he
performed well in the past. For this reason rms will rely on private oers, because in the

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

14

case of public oers rms make the oer available to all workers regardless of past performance. In order for the possibility of future interactions to provide an incentive, the rm
will need to pay a generous wage that oers a rent relative to being unemployed, and thus
workers are predicted to gain some of the surplus from trade. Some workers are predicted
to perform well even in the nal period, in response to a generous wage, reecting fairness concerns. Other workers who are concerned only with material payos will imitate fair
workers in early market periods, but will reduce eort to the minimum in the nal market
period when the threat of ring no longer has an impact. These predictions are part of a
particular equilibrium, but it is well known that in repeated games there exists a plethora
of equilibria (see, e.g., Fudenberg and Maskin (1986)). This highlights the need to perform
an experiment, in order to determine which equilibrium is selected. Brown, Falk, and Fehr
(2004) nd empirical support for these predictions, and our analysis in T-Baseline replicates
their results, setting the stage for answering our main research questions.
The rst question is how a dismissal barrier institution aects contract enforcement behavior in a setting with incomplete contracts and repeated interactions. We identify three
main predictions regarding the impact of dismissal barriers. The rst prediction is a negative incentive eect: in long-term relationships, the dismissal barrier institution removes the
threat of ring as an incentive device; as a result, selsh workers are predicted to shirk in
long-term relationships in T-Barrier, leading to lower eort levels than in T-Baseline. The

:

second prediction is a probation period eect

dismissal barriers are predicted to change

eort dynamics, such that eort is especially high in the initial probation period, because
workers have a greater benet from entering long-term relationships, and then drops sharply
once the rm commits do a long-term relationship, due to the removal of ring threat as an

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

15

incentive. The third prediction concerns relationship formation eects. Firms face a distribution of worker types, some who perform in the absence of ring threat and some who do
not, but the fact that average performance declines in long-run relationships is predicted to
make rms more reluctant to enter long-term relationships in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline.
The implication for the average length of relationships is ambiguous. Relationship avoidance
creates a larger number of one-shot relationships, but dismissal barriers imply that relationships that do form are likely to be long lasting, because rms are unable to re workers. The
unambiguous prediction is a change in the distribution of relationship lengths, such that the
distribution has more very short but also more long lasting relationships in T-Barrier.
The next question is how the impact of dismissal barriers interacts with the addition of
bonus pay.

In line with evidence from one-shot settings (Fehr, Gächter, and Kirchsteiger

(1997)), rms are predicted to pay bonuses for performing workers, creating a credible incentive for workers to perform even in the absence of ring threat. As a result, rms are
predicted to circumvent the negative incentive eect of dismissal barriers by using bonus
pay, so that eort in long-term relations is higher in T-Barrier-Bonus than in T-Barrier.
Furthermore, because incentives are high powered even after the probation period, there
will be a less pronounced probation eect in T-Barrier-Bonus compared to T-Barrier. The
prediction for relationship formation is ambiguous. On the one hand, rms should be less
reluctant to enter relationships since the hold-up problem is mitigated. On the other hand
they have another incentive tool at their disposal, and therefore may rely less on relational
contracting in the rst place.
This latter point raises the question how contract enforcement is aected by bonus pay in
general, i.e., in the absence of dismissal barriers. Shorter relationships in T-Barrier-Bonus

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

16

could reect a general tendency for bonus pay to lead rms to substitute away from relational incentives. This cannot be answered by T-Barrier-Bonus, because of the confounding
presence of dismissal barriers, and requires the fourth treatment T-Bonus. In the nal results
section we briey discuss the impact of bonus pay per se on contract enforcement, compared
to T-Baseline.

Results

4.1. Contract Enforcement in the Baseline Condition. To set the stage, we rst study
T-Baseline, where there is no dismissal barrier institution and no bonus pay. A rst observation is that worker eort levels in T-Baseline are quite high, despite the fact that the
sub-game perfect prediction for the stage game is an eort level of 1. The modal eort level
across all periods is

10,

the median is

7,

and the mean is

6.39

(these values are very similar

to those obtained in Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004)). The question then is how rms elicit
relatively high worker eort levels, in spite of the contract enforcement problem.
One clue is that high eort levels are mainly observed in private oer contracts, which
are typically part of long-term relationships. Long-term relationships arise when a rm and
worker endogenously choose to engage in sequence of two or more consecutive private oer
contracts with each other. Of all contracts,

64

67 percent are private oers, and of these roughly

percent end up being part of a relationship lasting at least 5 periods. The level of eort

in a given interaction is also strongly predictive of the ultimate length of the relationship:
the correlation between eort and ultimate length is

0.64

(Spearman;

p < 0.001)

Figure 1 shows that high eort levels and long-lasting relationships go together, due to
the contract enforcement strategy of rms: rms continue a relationship only in the case
that the worker performed well in the previous period. For low eort levels, the probability
that the rm terminates the relationship is close to 1, and for the maximum eort level the

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT
probability is close to zero.

17

We also estimated a Probit regression, where the dependent

variable is 1 in the case a worker is not rehired with a private oer and zero otherwise, and
nd that the estimated impact of an additional unit of eort in the previous period on the

[Figure 1 about here]

The policy of credibly punishing poor performance with termination provides a material
incentive for workers to perform, if workers nd continuing the relationship more attractive
than the alternative. The alternatives are either accepting a public oer, if one is available,
or unemployment. In fact, workers in private oer contracts earn

of ring serves as a credible incentive device, because ring imposes a cost on workers in

Workers earn a sizable rent even in the nal period, which is

important for sustaining an equilibrium with high eort levels in early periods.

earn rents, despite putting in high eort, because rms pay substantially higher (eciency)

This behavior is consistent with previous evidence indicating that

some individuals have reciprocal inclinations, rewarding generous wages with high eort,
even in the absence of strategic considerations (for a review see Fehr and Gächter (2000)).
Thus, although threat of ring is clearly important for motivating many of the worker subjects, for a sub-population fairness concerns are also relevant. The presence of such types is
important for deriving the equilibrium described in Section 3.
In summary, rms use a combination of rents and threat of ring to solve the contract
enforcement problem in T-Baseline, consistent with the disciplining version of eciency wage
theory (Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984)). At the same time, the ndings are also supportive of the
fairness version of eciency wage theory (Akerlof (1982), Akerlof and Yellen (1990)), in the

sense that a sub-population responds to generous wages with high eort even without ring
threat. These results provide a baseline for investigation of our main research questions.

4.2. Contract Enforcement and Dismissal Barriers. We now turn to how dismissal
barriers aect the strategic interactions of workers and rms, in an eciency wage setting.
We compare behavior in T-Baseline to behavior in T-Barrier, exploiting the exogenous variation in the presence of a dismissal barrier institution across treatments, while the form of
the labor contract (xed wages and no bonus pay) is held constant.
The rst way in which dismissal barriers are predicted to aect the equilibrium described
in Section 3 is by creating a negative incentive eect, such that (self-interested) workers
are more prone to shirk in long-term relationships.

Long-term relationships are dened

as interactions that involve at least two consecutive private oer contracts between the
same worker and rm.

12

In Column (1), we regress eort on a dummy for T-Barrier

and a constant (omitted category is T-Baseline). The coecient on the treatment dummy is
negative and highly signicant, indicating that dismissal barriers lead to lower eort levels
in long-term relationships. The treatment eect remains negative and signicant in Column
(2) where we control for other factors that might aect eort: wages, desired eort, and a
time trend.

[Table 3 about here]

If the drop in eort reects the removal of ring threat as an incentive device, we should
observe less of a dierence in one-shot interactions, where the institution does not aect
ability to dismiss poor performers. Estimating similar regression to those in Table 3, but
using worker eort decisions in one-shot interactions (public oer, or private oer contracts
that are not renewed), we do not observe a decit in T-Barrier eort levels relative to TBaseline.

In fact, eort levels are somewhat higher in one-shot interactions in T-Barrier

than in T-Baseline.

Later in the analysis we turn to possible reasons for the even better

performance of workers in one-shot interactions in T-Barrier. The important point for the
issue at hand is that eort levels are lower in T-Barrier precisely in situations where the

11The interval regression procedure maximizes a likelihood function that is a natural generalization of a Tobit,

treating each value as a left and right censored observation coming from an interval with known bounds. Error
terms are assumed to be normally distributed. For more information, see the STATA reference manual on
the intreg procedure listed under Tobit estimation. We nd similar results if we instead estimate regressions
using OLS.
12In this and other regressions, our conclusions are similar if we do not adjust for clustering, although
standard errors are typically smaller and eects are even more signicant.

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

21

institution makes a dierence for ring threat, consistent with the negative incentive eect
prediction.
It is noteworthy that aggregate eciency is substantially lower in T-Barrier than in TBaseline, indicating that the negative incentive eect in long-term relationships dominates
any tendency for dismissal barriers to enhance performance in one-shot interactions. Figure
3 shows the total economic surplus generated by trades in a given market period (averaged
across sessions), relative to the maximum possible surplus.

13

Whereas eciency is

63.86

percent of the maximum in T-Baseline overall, eciency is substantially lower in T-Barrier,
about

52 percent, and the dierence is growing over time.

Starting around period 6, eciency

in T-Baseline begins to climb steeply, as relationships begin to form, and leaves eciency in
T-Barrier behind. From period 10 through 17, for example, eciency in T-Baseline is about

19

percentage points, or

34

percent, higher than in T-Barrier (Mann-Whitney;

p < 0.05).

[Figure 3 about here]

Result 1: In a market with wage contracts, dismissal barriers cause signicantly lower
worker eort levels in long-term relationships, and lower market eciency.
The next prediction concerns the dynamics of worker eort provision.

The dismissal

barrier institution prevents rms from using the threat of ring once a rm chooses to
extend the relationship beyond the initial private oer contract, which we refer to as the
probation period. Workers are predicted to sharply reduce eort relative to performance
in the probation period, as soon as they are oered and accept a second private oer in
a row from the same rm.

This behavior would also shed further light on the negative

13Total surplus is rm revenues, minus worker eort costs and opportunity costs in terms of unemployment

benets. With 7 rms in each session, the maximum possible surplus in a period is equal to 7·(10·10−18−5) =
77 · 7 = 539.

incentive eect of the dismissal institution, by conrming that the lower eort levels in longterm relationships in T-Barrier reect a within-individual moral hazard response, rather than
other potential factors, for example a dierent composition of types who end up in long-term
relationships in T-Barrier.
The probability of an eort drop is much larger in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline, and the
size of the dierence is also larger, supporting the prediction. The unconditional probability
that a worker reduces eort in the second period of a relationship is
in T-Baseline.

Furthermore, the average drop is equal to

0.11.

Figure 4 compares median eort, and also the distribution of eort, before and after
the probation period.

The sample is restricted to individuals who are ultimately rehired

after the probationary period, so results for probationary and all later periods are based on
the same sample of individuals. The boxes indicate the inter-quartile ranges (25th to 75th
percentile) of the eort distributions, and the circular markers indicate the median eort
levels. In T-Barrier, median eort drops sharply in later relationship periods relative to the
probation period, and there is a substantial increase in the variance of eort. The opposite
pattern is observed in T-Baseline.

Results are similar if we instead compare eort in the

probation period to eort in the second period of relationships only; the drop in eort in
T-Barrier is immediate, occurring as soon as the probation period is passed, whereas eort
increases in T-Baseline (see also Table 4, where we focus on comparing eort in the second
relationship period to eort in the probation period).

Thus, dismissal barriers lead to a

post-probation-period drop in median eort, and an increase in eort variance in long-term
relationships.

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

23

The distribution in Figure 4 also reveals that there are still some workers in T-Barrier
who choose close to maximum eort. This is consistent with the presence of some fair types
who perform well even when dismissal barriers eliminate ring threat.

[Figure 4 about here]

Table 4 investigates the probation period eect on eort dynamics using regression analysis. The sample comprises all private-oer contracts taking place in the second period of a
long-term relationship. The dependent variable in each column is equal to 1 if eort dropped
relative to the rst period of the relationship, and zero otherwise. Coecients are marginal
eects. Column (1) indicates that the probability of eort dropping is signicantly larger in
T-Barrier compared to T-Baseline, and Column (2) shows that this is still true conditioning
on characteristics of the previous period interaction, and the contract terms in the current
period, as well as a time trend.

[Table 4 about here]

Dismissal barriers are also predicted to have an impact on the level of eort in the initial
probation period, because workers are willing to work even harder to entice the rm into
making a second private oer. This motivation comes from the fact that workers anticipate
enjoying a stronger strategic position once they get to enter a long-term relationship. Returning to Figure 4, it is evident that median eort is in fact higher in the probation period
in T-Barrier, compared to the initial period of a relationship in T-Baseline.

An interval

regression using only initial private oer contracts that subsequently lead to long-term relationships shows that the eort level is higher by
wages, desired eort, and a time trend (p

0.629 points on average after controlling for

< 0.017;

14

robust s.e., clustering on session).

This suggests that dismissal barriers might also aect the type of workers who enter longterm relationships. For example, workers who are strategic and motivated only by material
payos might be better at signaling to rms during the probation period that they have
an intention to work hard in long-term relationships. One way to assess the proportion of
selsh versus fair types who end up in long-term relationships is to look at the sensitivity of
eort levels to wages in the nal market period. The greater the fraction of selsh workers,
the less sensitive eort should be to high wage oers. Using all private oer contracts in the
nal period, which were part of an on-going relationship in the previous period, we regressed
eort on wages (interval regression; robust s.e. clustering on session). The impact of wages
is positive but not signicant in T-Barrier (p
signicant in T-Baseline (p

< 0.001).15

whereas the impact of wages on and

Thus, there is some suggestive evidence of a type of

adverse selection, in terms of worker propensity to shirk, despite the fact that cost functions
are held constant and thus there is no scope for adverse selection in the typical sense of
worker ability dierences.

14As noted above in our analysis of the negative incentive eect, eort levels in one-shot interactions are

also higher in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline, and signicantly so. With the exception of trades occurring in
period 18, where there is no potential for being re-hired, these one-shot interactions can also be interpreted
as probation periods, albeit ones that were unsuccessful. We estimate an interval regression where the
dependent variable is worker eort levels in one-shot interactions, excluding trades in period 18, and nd
that eort is higher in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline: the dierence in eort levels is 0.879 (p < 0.044; robust
s.e., clustering on session). This behavior is consistent with the existence of a heterogeneous population of
types and the fact that individuals understand this, and therefore attempt to signal their good characteristics
with high eort during the probation period.
15It turns out that in T-Barrier and T-Baseline, the number of private-oer contracts in long-term relationships in period 18 is exactly the same, so the dierence in signicance levels does not simply reect dierent
number of observations.

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

25

Result 2: In a market with wage contracts dismissal barriers there is a probation period

eect, such that workers reduce eort sharply as soon as the rm triggers dismissal barriers
by re-hiring the worker beyond the initial contract. The variance of eort also increases. In
the absence of dismissal barriers the opposite pattern occurs. Dismissal barriers also have
an additional, positive incentive eect, such that the level of eort in the probation period is
even higher than in a market without dismissal barriers.

Although rms face a distribution of worker types, and thus uncertainty about the outcome of entering a long-term relationship, the fact that on average performance suers is
predicted to make rms less likely to enter relationships in the rst place. Consistent with
the prediction of relationship avoidance we nd that 58 percent of all contracts were in oneshot interactions in T-Barrier, compared to 48 percent in T-Baseline. Even more tellingly,
we observe 23 percent of all rms in T-Barrier pursuing a strategy of strict relationshipavoidance, never making two private oers in a row to the same worker, during the entire
game.

This contrasts with only 9 percent of rms exhibiting this strategy in T-Baseline

where dismissal barriers are absent. Put another way, the probability that a rm has never
been in a long-term relationship as of market period

t is consistently higher in T-Barrier than

in T-Baseline. We estimate a Cox proportional hazard model, and nd that this survival
probability is higher in T-Barrier compared to T-Baseline. This dierence is only marginally
signicant overall (p

< 0.07;

robust s.e., clustering on session), reecting the fact that the

survival probabilities are close to 1 in both treatments for the rst few market periods; in
general long-term relationships do not form until after the rst few market periods, during
which rms appear to engage in a process of search. Considering market periods beyond period 5, however, the survival probability decreases sharply in T-Baseline whereas the decline

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

26

is slower in T-Barrier, leading to a large dierence that is statistically signicant at the ve
percent level (p

< 0.043;

robust s.e., clustering on session).

The barrier institution prevents rms from dismissing workers, which makes it less likely
that relationships that do form will break up. This latter tendency is reinforced by the fact
that workers essentially never quit once they are protected by dismissal barriers. Workers
opt out of a relationship protected by dismissal barriers in only

out of

283

which is understandable given that in T-Barrier worker earnings are about

such contracts,

48 percent higher

on average in long-term relationships than in one-shot interactions. It turns out that the
rate of turnover, measured as the average length of a relationship, is essentially the same in
T-Barrier and T-Baseline:

5.99 periods versus 5.89.

Thus, the resulting stability of long-term

relationships happens to just oset the tendency for rms to avoid relationships.
Figure 5 shows that dismissal barriers change the distribution of relationship lengths in
the market. The fractions of relationships in the two most extreme categories, which include
one-shot interactions or long-term relationships lasting 14 periods or more, respectively, are
higher in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline.

The opposite is true for the three intermediate

categories of relationship lengths. A Probit regression shows that probability of observing a
relationship in one of the two extreme categories is signicantly higher in T-Barrier than in
T-Baseline (p

< 0.001;

robust s.e., clustering on session).

[Figure 5 about here]

Result 3 : In a market with wage contracts, rms are more reluctant to enter long-term

relationships in the presence of the dismissal barrier institution. They also cannot terminate
relationships, and as a consequence the distribution of relationship lengths in the market

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

27

becomes more bi-modal at the extremes, with more one-shot interactions but also more very
long relationships.

4.3. Dismissal Barriers and Bonus Pay. In T-Barrier-Bonus, we add the option for
rms to pay bonuses.

For bonus pay to serve as an incentive device, rms must credibly

reward worker eort with bonus payments.

Figure 6 shows that bonus payments are in

fact strongly increasing in worker performance, and thus that bonus payments are credible.
We also regressed actual bonus payments in period

t

on worker eort levels in

t

(interval

regression), and found that the relationship between eort and bonus payments is positive
and highly statistically signicant, controlling for wages, desired eort, and a time trend
(p

< 0.001;

robust s.e., clustering on session).

[Figure 6 about here]

With bonus pay serving as a credible incentive device, rms have a way to at least partially
circumvent the negative incentive eect created by dismissal barriers. Figure 2 shows that,
indeed, worker eort levels in long-term relationships are consistently much higher in TBarrier-Bonus than in T-Barrier (average eort is

8.2

rather than

5.5),

and achieve a level

very close to what is observed in T-Baseline. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 3 indicate that the
dierence in eort levels is positive and statistically signicant when comparing T-BarrierBonus to T-Barrier, controlling for other variables relevant for eort.

Columns (5) and

(6) conrm that eort levels in T-Barrier-Bonus are not signicantly dierent from eort
levels in T-Baseline.

Thus, the option to pay bonuses allows rms to undo the negative

eects of dismissal barriers.

As shown in Figure 3, bonus pay also undoes much of the

negative impact of dismissal barriers on market eciency. Eciency in T-Barrier-Bonus is

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

lower than eciency in T-Baseline, and the dierence is not statistically

signicant (Mann Whitney;

p < 0.87).

Given that the negative incentive eect of dismissal barriers is largely neutralized by bonus
pay, eort dynamics are predicted to be more similar to those observed in T-Baseline. Figure
4 supports this prediction. The median eort level increases after the probation period, and
variance decreases, similar to what is observed in T-Baseline.

The level of eort in the

initial period of relationships is also similar to that in T-Baseline, consistent with bonus pay
reducing the incentive for workers to entice rms into relationships. Columns (3) and (4) of
Table 4 reveal that the probability of a drop in eort is signicantly lower in T-Barrier-Bonus
than in T-Barrier, and Columns (5) and (6) show that the probability of a drop in eort in
T-Barrier-Bonus is not statistically dierent from in T-Baseline.
While rms have less reason to avoid relationships in T-Barrier-bonus, because bonus pay
helps solve the incentive problem, bonus pay also provides a substitute for relational incentives, and thus rms may be less interested in entering relationships for this reason. The
fraction of rms who never enter a long-term relationship in T-Barrier-Bonus is 19 percent,
somewhat lower than in T-Barrier where the fraction is 24 percent, but substantially above
the 9 percent observed in T-Baseline. The survival probability of never having entered a relationship also indicates that rms in T-Barrier-Bonus are more prone to avoid relationships
than rms in T-Baseline. A Cox mixed proportional hazard model shows that the survival
probability is signicantly higher than in T-Baseline (p
session).

Compared to T-Barrier, the survival probability is higher but not signicantly

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT
dierent (p

< 0.79;

29

robust s.e., clustering on session). Thus, the tendency to avoid relation-

ships is similar to in T-Barrier, despite the lack of a strong negative incentive problem. This
nding is consistent with bonus pay changing the way that rms enforce contracts, such that
they substitute away from relational incentives to one-shot interactions and the use of bonus
incentives. To attribute this change to the eect of bonus pay, however, requires our fourth
treatment, T-Bonus, where we observe the impact of bonus pay without the confounding
eect of dismissal barriers. We turn to this comparison in the next section.

Result 4: The presence of bonus pay strongly aects the impact of the dismissal barrier

institution, eliminating both the negative incentive eect and probation period eect. Relationship initiation, however, remains altered relative to T-Baseline, with rms being less
likely to enter long-term relationships.

4.4. Impact of Bonus Pay in the Absence of Dismissal Barriers. In T-Bonus rms
have the option to pay bonuses, but there is no dismissal institution in the market. This
allows us to isolate the impact of bonus pay per se on contract enforcement policies and
market outcomes.
If bonus pay and relationships are substitutes in the contract enforcement policies of rms
(which would help explain the low rate of relationship formation in T-Barrier-Bonus), then
introducing bonus pay should lead to fewer and shorter long-term relationships, compared
to a market where labor contracts are restricted to xed wages. In fact,

17

percent of rms

never try to enter a long-term relationship in T-Bonus, substantially larger than the 9 percent
observed in T-Baseline. A Cox proportional hazard model tells a similar story, showing that
the survival probability for never having entered a long-run relationship is higher in T-Bonus
than in T-Baseline, with the dierence becoming statistically signicant considering periods

that the distribution of relationship lengths is not bi-modal in T-Bonus, as in the other
treatments, but rather has a single mode in the category of one-shot interactions and the
next highest fraction in the category of relationships lasting only 2 to 5 periods. In other
words, bonus pay leads to a leftward shift in the distribution, away from longer relationships.
For example, a Probit regression shows that the probability of observing a relationship in the
longest length category of 14 or more is signicantly lower in T-Bonus than in T-Baseline
(p

< 0.048;

robust s.e., clustering on session). These ndings indicate that bonus pay and

relational incentives are in fact substitutes, and helps explain why there is a relatively low
rate of relationship formation in T-Barrier-Bonus, despite the lack of a negative incentive
eect in long-term relationships. While the introduction of bonus pay neutralizes most of the
eects of dismissal barriers, it leaves contract enforcement policies fundamentally changed
by providing an alternative strategy for contract enforcement.
T-Bonus also provides a useful counter-factual for T-Barrier-Bonus, helping disentangle
the impact of dismissal barriers from the eect of bonus pay on the strategic position of
workers and rms. In particular, although rms achieve a high level of worker performance
in long-term relationships in T-Barrier-Bonus, comparable to in T-Bonus (see Figure 2), the
lack of ring threat caused by dismissal barriers would seem to weaken the strategic position
of rms. Figure 6 shows that in fact rms in T-Barrier-Bonus pay higher bonuses compared
to rms in T-Bonus, to achieve the same level of performance, especially at higher eort
levels. In a regression of actual bonus payment on worker eort, the wage, desired eort,
a time trend, and a dummy variable for T-Barrier-Bonus (omitted category T-Bonus), the
treatment dummy is positive and signicant (p

< 0.046;

robust s.e., clustering on session),

INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT

indicating that for a given wage and eort, rms must pay a higher bonus when dismissal
barriers are present in the market. This can also be seen by looking at total rents oered
to workers in a given market period, calculated in the same way as in the initial analysis of
T-Baseline above. Workers earn larger rents in T-Barrier-Bonus than in T-Bonus, in every
market period.

16

Thus, although bonus pay allows rms to largely circumvent the negative

incentive eect of dismissal barriers in T-Barrier-Bonus, dismissal barriers still impose a cost
on rms. Put another way, the availability of ring threat allows rms to achieve the same
level of worker performance with lower bonuses and lower oered rents.
Recent studies have compared the eciency of bonus versus wage contracts in one-shot interactions, and found that bonus contracts are much superior (e.g., Fehr, Klein, and Schmidt
(2007)), which raises the question how bonus contracts fare relative to wage contracts in a
setting with repeated interactions. The dierence we nd is positive but relatively small: aggregate eciency is

68.54

percent of maximum in T-Bonus compared to

63.86

in T-Baseline

(see also Figure 3). One explanation for the relatively good performance of wage contracts
is that in a setting with repeated interactions rms can employ ring threat as an incentive
device, whereas in one-shot settings the only reason for a worker to perform under a xed
wage contract is fairness preferences.

Result 5: Bonus pay causes rms to substitute away from relational incentives in their

contract enforcement policies. Although bonus pay allows rms to oset negative incentive
eects of dismissal barriers, dismissal barriers still impose a cost on rms by requiring rms
to pay a higher bonus and oer higher rents for a given level of eort. The benets of bonus
pay per se for market eciency, relative to eciency wage contracts, is decreasing over time.
16Taking the average worker rent from being employed in a given session as one independent observation,

rents oered by rms in sessions for the T-Barrier-Bonus treatment are signicantly higher than those oered
by rms in the T-Bonus treatment (Mann-Whitney; p<0.007). Detailed results available upon request.

Discussion

This paper explores how the complex interplay between contract enforcement behaviors
and embedding institutions determines market outcomes.

With incomplete contracts and

repeated interactions, ring threat is crucial for market eciency, and dismissal barriers
worsen performance by hindering this mechanism and by discouraging relationship formation
in the rst place.

Allowing for greater exibility in contractual instruments, in the form

of bonus pay, undoes the eects of dismissal barriers, while leaving contract enforcement
strategies fundamentally changed.
Our paper is also complementary to the empirical literature that studies dismissal barriers
in the form of employment protection legislation (EPL). Our results show that the impact
of dismissal barriers depends crucially on details of the institutional environment. This is
consistent with the empirical literature, which sometimes nds zero and other times nds
moderate eects of EPL on various types of outcomes (e.g., Lazear (1990), Nickell (1997),
Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006), MacLeod and Nakavachara (2007)). Furthermore, our
ndings highlight a specic institutional feature that is relevant for whether dismissal barriers
have a strong or weak eect on market performance, namely exibility of the labor contract.
In the spirit of the Coasian intuition articulated by Lazear (1990), we nd that giving parties
additional contractual instruments allows them to contract around the negative eects of
dismissal barriers. As noted by Krueger (1991), a key challenge for assessing the impact of
EPL in the eld is that the law change itself might be correlated with other factors that are

17

related to economic performance.

In this regard our experimental approach is also useful,

because variation in institutions is clearly exogenous. Finally, our results are supportive of
other eld evidence on specic impacts of EPL. Although measuring shirking in the eld is

dicult, Ichino and Riphan (2005) nd evidence of a probation eect similar to ours: worker
absenteeism sharply increases when workers are re-hired beyond the probation period for
employment protection legislation in Italy. Other studies nd a positive correlation between
the strength of employment protection legislation and rms' usage of temp agency workers
as opposed to long-term contracts (see, e.g., Autor (2003), and Cahuc and Postel-Vinay
(2002)), which is in line with the strategic behavior we observe among rms.

APPENDIX: INSTRUCTIONS
In the following we present representative instructions, in this case for a worker (seller)
from the treatment T-Barrier. Instructions for firms (buyers) and for participants in other
treatments are exactly the same, except for including explanation of the option for firms
to pay bonuses in the case of T-Barrier-Bonus and T-Bonus, or excluding the final
section explaining the dismissal barrier institution in the case of T-Bonus and T-Baseline.
Instructions for Sellers

You are now taking part in an economic experiment. Please read the following
instructions carefully. Everything that you need to know to participate in this experiment
is explained below. Should you have any difficulties in understanding these instructions
please notify us. We will answer your questions at your cubicle.
At the beginning of the experiment you will receive an initial sum of 8 Euro. During the
course of the experiment you can earn a further amount of money by gaining points. The
amount of points that you gain during the experiment depends on your decisions and the
decisions of other participants.
All points that you gain during the course of the experiment will be exchanged into Euro
at the end of the experiment. The exchange rate will be:
1 point = 4 Cents
At the end of the experiment you will receive the sum of money that you earned
during the experiment in addition to your 8 Euro initial sum.
The experiment is divided into periods. In each period you have to make decisions which
you will enter in a computer. There are 18 periods in all.
Please note that communication between participants is strictly prohibited during the
experiment. In addition we would like to point out that you may only use the computer
functions which are required for the experiment. Communication between participants
and unnecessary interference with computers will lead to exclusion from the experiment.
In case you have any questions we shall be glad to assist you.
Prior to the experiment the 17 participants were divided into 2 groups: buyers and sellers.
In this experiment there are 10 sellers and 7 buyers.

You shall be a seller for the entire course of the experiment. All participants have
received an identification number, which they will keep for the entire experiment. Your
identification number is stated on the documentation sheet in front of you.

An Overview of the Experiment Procedures
In each period of the experiment every buyer can trade a product with one seller. The
seller earns a profit through the trade when he sells the product at a price that exceeds his
production costs. The buyer earns a profit through the trade when the price he pays for
the product is less than what it is worth to him. How high the production costs are for the
traded product, and how much it is worth to the buyer, depends on the quality of the
product.
The experiment lasts 18 periods. In each period the procedures are as follows:
1. Each period commences with a trading phase, which lasts 150 seconds. During this
phase buyers can submit trade offers, which can be accepted by sellers.
When submitting an offer a buyer has to specify three things:
• which price he offers to pay,
• which product quality he desires,
• and finally, which seller he wants to submit the offer to. Hereby, buyers can
submit two types of offers; private offers and public offers. Private offers are
submitted to one seller only and can only be accepted by that seller. Public
offers are submitted to all sellers and can be accepted by any seller.
Buyers can submit as many offers as they like in each period. Submitted offers can be
accepted constantly. Each buyer and each seller can only enter one trade
agreement in each period. As there are 10 sellers and 7 buyers, several sellers will
not trade in each period.
2. Following the trading phase each seller who has entered a trade agreement determines
which quality of product he will supply to his buyer. Hereby, the seller is not obliged
to supply the product quality desired by his buyer.
Please note: If the same buyer has made private offer to the same seller in two
consecutive periods, and if the seller has accepted these two offers, the seller enjoys the
“right to get an offer”. This means that the buyer has to make this seller an offer in the
next period. If the seller accepts, this “right to get an offer” continues to exist. If he
rejects, the buyer is free to make an offer to any seller.
Once every seller has chosen which product quality to supply, incomes gained by each
participant in that period are determined and reported on the screen. After this the next

period commences. The points gained from all 18 periods will be summed up at the end
of the experiment, exchanged into Euros and paid together with your initial sum of
money in cash.
Procedures in Detail
There are 7 buyers and 10 sellers in the experiment. You are a seller for the entire course
of the experiment. During the experiment you will enter your decisions on the computer.
In the following we describe in detail how you can make your decisions in each period.
1. The Trading Phase
Each period commences with a trading phase. During the trading phase each buyer can
enter into a trading agreement with one seller. In order to do this the buyers can submit
trade offers to the sellers. As a seller you can accept one of the offers submitted to you in
each period. During the trading phase you will see the following screen:
Seller trading screen
•

In the top left corner of the screen you will see the current period of the experiment.
In the top right corner of the screen you will see the time remaining in this trading
phase, displayed in seconds. The trading phase in each period lasts 150 seconds.
When this time is up the trading phase is over. Hereafter, no further offers can be
submitted or accepted for this period.

•

Once you see the above screen displayed the trading phase commences. As a seller
you can now accept offers, which buyers have submitted to you. There are two types
of offers which you can accept:
• Private offers to you
Each buyer has the opportunity to submit private offers to you. You alone will be
informed of these offers and you alone can accept them. No other seller or buyer
is informed of these offers. If you receive private offers, they will appear on the left
side of your screen, below the title “private offers to you”. The offer of a buyer will
contain the following information: the identification number of the buyer who
submitted the offer, the price which he offers for the product, and which product
quality he desires. If you want to accept a private offer, you click first on the
respective row in which the offer is displayed. When you do this, the offer will be
highlighted. If you are sure you want to accept the offer you then click on the button
“accept” which is situated in the bottom left corner of the screen. As long as you do
not click “accept” you can alter your choice.

• Public offers
Each buyer also has the possibility to submit public offers. All sellers are informed of
these offers and any seller can accept them. If a buyer submits a public offer it will
appear on the right side of your screen, below the title “public offers”. The offer of a
buyer again contains the identification number of the buyer who submitted the offer,
the price which he offers for the product and which product quality he desires. This
information is also displayed to all other sellers and all buyers. If you want to accept
a public offer you follow the same procedures as with private offers. You first click
on the respective row in which the offer is displayed. When you are sure that you
want to accept the offer you then click on the button “accept” which is situated in the
bottom right corner of the screen. As long as you do not click “accept” you can alter
your choice.

•

As soon as you have pressed the “accept” button you will see which offer you have
accepted in the bottom row of your screen.

Each seller can enter only one trade agreement in each period. Once you have
accepted one offer you cannot accept any further offers.

All buyers have to observe the following rules when submitting trade offers:
•

The price offered by the buyer may not be lower than 0 or higher than 100:
0 ≤ price ≤ 100

•

The desired quality of the buyer may not be below 1 or higher than 10:
1 ≤ desired quality ≤ 10

•

As long as no offer has been accepted by a seller, the buyer can make as many
public and private offers as he wishes. Each offer submitted by a buyer can be
accepted at any time during the trading phase.

•

Each buyer can enter only one trade agreement in each period. Once an offer of a
buyer has been accepted he will be notified which seller accepted it. As each buyer
can enter only one trade agreement in each period all other offers of the buyer will be
automatically cancelled. Also, he will not be able to submit any further offers.

•

Once all 7 buyers have entered a trade agreement or after 150 seconds have elapsed,
the trading phase is over.

•

No buyer is obliged to submit trade offers, and no seller is obliged to accept a trade
offer.

2. Determination of the Product Quality
•

Following the trading phase, all sellers who have entered a trade-agreement then
determine which product quality they will supply to their respective buyers. The
product quality desired by your buyer is not binding for you as a seller. You can
choose the exact quality desired by your buyer, but also a higher or lower product
quality. If you have entered a trade agreement during a trading phase, the following
screen will appear for you to enter the product quality:
Seller quality choice screen

In order to choose the actual product quality, you enter the value for the quality in the
field “Determine the actual product quality” and press the “ok” button to confirm your
choice. As long as you have not pressed “ok” you can alter your choice.
•

The product quality that you choose must be an integer between 1 and 10.
1 ≤ actual product quality ≤ 10

How are the incomes calculated?
Your income:
•

If you have not entered a trade agreement during a trading phase you gain an
income of 5 points for that period.

•

If you have accepted a trade offer your income depends on the price you accepted and
the product quality you chose to deliver. Your income will be calculated as follows:
Your income = Price - production costs

•

Your production costs are higher, the higher the quality of the product you chose to
deliver. The production costs for each product quality are displayed in the table
below:

cost
•

Your income is therefore higher, the lower your chosen product quality. Furthermore,
your income is higher the higher is the price offered by the buyer.

The income of your buyer:
•

If a buyer does not enter a trade agreement during a trading phase he gains an income
of 0 points for that period.

•

If one of his trade offers is accepted, his income depends on which price he offered
and which product quality was supplied to him. The income of your buyer will be
determined as follows:
Income of your buyer = 10 * product quality - price

•

As you can see from the above formula the income of your buyer is higher, the higher
is the product quality actually supplied by you. At the same time his income is higher,
the lower the price he paid for the product.

The income of all buyers and sellers are determined in the same way. Each buyer can
therefore calculate the income of his seller and each seller can calculate the income
of his buyer. Furthermore, each buyer and seller is informed of the identification number
of his trading partner in each period.
Please note that buyers and sellers can incur losses in each period. These losses have to
be paid from your initial sum of money or from earnings in other periods.
You will be informed of your income and the income of your buyer on an “income
screen”. On the screen (see below) the following will be displayed:
• Which buyer you traded with
• Which price he offered
• The desired quality of your buyer
• The product quality supplied by you
• The income of your buyer in this period
• Your income in this period.
Seller income screen

Please enter all the information in the documentation sheet supplied to you. After the
income screen has been displayed, the respective period is concluded. Thereafter the
trading phase of the following period commences. Once you have finished studying the
income screen please click on the “next” button.
The buyers also view an income screen, which displays the above information. They see
the ID of their trading partner, the price, desired and supplied product quality as well as
both incomes.

“Right to get an offer”-Rule
There is one more rule to consider. If the same buyer has made two private offers to the
same seller in two consecutive periods, and both offers were accepted so that they each
lead to a trade agreement, the seller enjoys the “right to get an offer” in the next period.
This is the case, e.g., if buyer 1 makes seller 2 private offers, one in period 3 and one in
period 4, which are both accepted by seller 2. Starting from period 5, seller 2 then enjoys
the “right to get an offer”.
The right to get an offer is thus established when a buyer has traded at least twice with
the same seller, and if these trades came about through private offers. If trade comes
about based on a public offer, the right to get an offer is not established. Thus the buyer
himself can decide whether he wants to enter a relationship with or without the right to
get an offer.
In other words the “right to get an offer” means that in the next period the buyer
must make the seller an offer that is available as soon as soon as the trading phase
begins. This offer consists of a price and desired quality. The price must be at least as
high as in the previous period.
If the same buyer has offered you two times in a row a private offer, which you accepted,
you enjoy the right to get an offer. This means “your” buyer must make you an offer in
the next period. In this case the trading phase begins with the following screen.
Modified trading phase screen
This is the same screen as on page 3 with the only difference that on the upper right
corner you now see the offer of your buyer. In addition you also see the other public and
private offers, which have been offered to you and the other sellers. You can accept the
offer of “your” buyer or any other offer that has been made (private or public) by
other buyers.
As long as you have not yet decided, “your” buyer cannot make another offer to you
or another seller. This means that you can accept the offer of “your” buyer as long as
you have not declined it (and trading time has not yet elapsed).

Your buyer will be informed about your decision. If you reject his offer or if you accept
another buyer’s offer, “your” buyer is free to make offers to other sellers. As long as you
have not yet decided, all “your” buyer can do is wait and observe the market.
If you accept the offer of “your” buyer, he will also make you an offer in the next period.
Only if you reject his offer or if you accept the offer of another buyer, the right to get an
offer expires. This means that the right to get an offer can only be terminated by
yourself.
An example concerning the right to get an offer: Suppose buyer 1 and seller 2 have traded
in periods three and four, based on two private offers. Starting from period 5 seller 2
then enjoys the right to get an offer. This means that buyer 1 has to make seller 2 an offer
in the fifth period before the trading period begins. If seller 2 accepts, the relation
remains and buyer 1 will make seller 2 an offer also in period 6. If seller 2 rejects, the
relation is terminated and buyer 1 can thereafter make offers to all sellers (public and
private).
The experiment will not commence until all participants are completely familiar with all
procedures. In order to secure that this is the case we kindly ask you to solve the
exercises below.
In addition we will conduct a training trial of the trading phase, so that you can get
accustomed to the computer. This trial phase will not be added to the result of the
experiment and therefore not remunerated. Following the trial phase we will begin the
experiment, which will last for 18 periods.

Exercises
Please solve the following problems including the solution approach. If you have any
questions please ask the experimenter. Wrong answers have no consequences
whatsoever.
