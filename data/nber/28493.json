    "abstract": "\n\nUsing a survey of AFA members, we analyze how demographics, time allocation, production mechanisms, and institutional factors affect research production during the pandemic. Consistent with the literature, research productivity falls more for women and faculty with young children. Independently and novel, extra time spent teaching (much more likely for women) negatively affects research productivity. Also novel are the results that concerns about feedback, isolation, and health have large negative research effects, disproportionately affecting junior faculty and PhD students. Finally, faculty facing greater concerns about employers\u2019 finances report larger negative research effects and more concerns about feedback, isolation and health.\n\n",
