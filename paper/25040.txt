Leverage-Induced Fire Sales and Stock Market Crashes

ABSTRACT
We provide direct evidence of leverage-induced fire sales contributing to a market crash using
account-level trading data for brokerage- and shadow-financed margin accounts during the
Chinese stock market crash of 2015. Margin investors heavily sell their holdings when their
account-level leverage edges toward their maximum leverage limits, controlling for stock-date
and account fixed effects. Stocks that are disproportionately held by accounts close to leverage
limits experience high selling pressure and abnormal price declines which subsequently reverse.
Unregulated shadow-financed margin accounts, facilitated by FinTech lending platforms,
contributed more to the crash despite their smaller asset holdings relative to regulated brokerage
accounts.

Introduction

Excessive leverage and the subsequent leverage-induced re sales are considered to be major contributing factors to many past nancial crises. A prominent example is the US stock market crash of
1929. At the time, leverage for stock market margin trading was unregulated. Margin credit, i.e.,
debt that individual investors borrow to purchase stocks, rose from around 12% of NYSE market
value in 1917 to around 20% in 1929 (Schwert, 1989). In October 1929, investors began facing margin calls. As investors quickly sold assets to deleverage their positions, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average experienced a record loss of 13% in a single day, later known as Black Monday on October
28, 1929.

1

Other signicant examples of deleveraging and market crashes include the US housing

crisis which led to the 2007/08 global nancial crisis (see e.g., Mian et al. (2013)) and the Chinese
stock market crash in the summer of 2015. The latter market crash will be the focus of this paper.
As the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression, the 2007/08 global nancial crisis
greatly revived the interest of academics and policy makers in understanding and measuring the
costs and benets of nancial leverage.

In terms of academic research, the theory has arguably

advanced ahead of the empirics. For instance, in a general equilibrium framework, Brunnermeier
and Pedersen (2009) and Geanakoplos (2010) carefully model a downward leverage spiral in which
tightened leverage constraints trigger re sales, which then depress asset prices, leading to even
tighter leverage constraints. This general equilibrium theory features a devastating positive feedback
loop that is able to match various pieces of anecdotal evidence, and is widely considered to be one
of the leading mechanisms behind the meltdown of the nancial system during the 2007/08 crisis.
Despite its widespread acceptance, there is little direct empirical evidence of leverage-induced re
sales contributing to stock market crashes. Empirical tests of the theory are challenging because
of the limited availability of detailed account-level data on leverage and trading activities.

This

paper contributes to the literature on leverage and nancial crashes by providing direct evidence of
leverage-induced re sales.
We use unique account-level data in China that track hundreds of thousands of margin investors'
borrowing and trading activities. The Chinese stock market has become increasingly important in
the global economy; for an informative reading, see Carpenter and Whitelaw (2017). With market
value equal to approximately one-third that of the US market, it is now the second largest stock
market in the world.

period that is ideal for examining the asset pricing implications of leverage-induced re sales. The
Chinese stock market experienced a dramatic run-up in the rst half of 2015, followed by an unprecedented crash in the middle of 2015 which wiped out about 30% of the market's value by the end
of July 2015.
Individual retail investors are the dominant players in the Chinese stock market and were the

2

main users of leveraged margin trading systems.

Our data covers two types of margin accounts,

brokerage-nanced and shadow-nanced margin accounts, for the three-month span of May to July,
2015. Both margin trading systems grew rapidly in popularity in early 2015. The brokerage-nanced
margin system, which allows retail investors to obtain credit from their brokerage rm, is tightly
regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). For instance, investors must be
suciently wealthy and experienced to qualify for brokerage nancing. Further, the CSRC imposes
a market-wide maximum level of leveragethe Pingcang Line beyond which the account is taken
over by the lending broker, triggering forced asset sales.

3

In contrast, the shadow-nanced margin system, aided by the burgeoning FinTech industry, falls
in a regulatory gray area. Shadow-nancing was not initially regulated by the CSRC, and lenders do
not require borrowers to have a minimum level of wealth or trading history to qualify for borrowing.
There is no regulated Pingcang Line for shadow-nanced margin trades.

Instead, the maximum

leverage limits are individually negotiated between borrowers and shadow lenders. Not surprisingly,
shadow accounts have signicantly higher leverage than their brokerage counterparts.

4

On June 12, 2015, the CSRC released a set of draft rules that would tighten regulations on
shadow-nanced margin trading in the future; a month-long stock market crash started on the next
trading day, wiping out almost 40% of the market index.

The shadow-nanced margin accounts

data is particularly interesting for our study of the market crash, because it is widely believed that
excessive leverage taken by unregulated shadow-nanced margin accounts and the subsequent re
sales induced by the deleveraging process were the main driving forces behind the collapse of the
Chinese stock market in the summer of 2015.

From this perspective, one of our main contributions

Trading volume from retail traders covers 85% of the total volume, according to Shanghai Stock Exchange

Annual Statistics 2015, http://www.sse.com.cn/aboutus/publication/yearly/documents/c/tjnj_2015.pdf. It is well
known that retail traders play signicant roles even in more developed nancial markets; see, e.g., Foucault et al.
(2011).

3

The maximum leverage or Pingcang Line corresponds to the reciprocal of the maintenance margin in the US.

Pingcang in Chinese means forced settlement by creditors.

4

This is conrmed in our sample.

The equal-weighted average leverage (measured as assets/equity) is 6.6 for

shadow accounts and only 1.4 for brokerage accounts.

5

Common beliefs regarding the causes of the crash are discussed, for example, in a Financial Times article, availa-

ble at https://www.ft.com/content/6eadedf6-254d-11e5-bd83-71cb60e8f08c?mhq5j=e4. Another relevant reading in

2

is to show how re sales can result when new nancial innovations (FinTech in our case) advance
ahead of regulation, much like unregulated margin trading during the US stock market crash in
1929.
We begin our empirical analysis by identifying how leverage and leverage constraints aect
individual investor trading behavior. For each account-date, we rst construct a Distance-to-MarginCall measure based on the account's leverage (dened as the ratio of asset value to equity value), its
Pingcang Line, and the volatility of the assets held by the account. In the spirit of the Distance-toDefault measure in Merton-style models, Distance-to-Margin-Call captures the risk that a margin
account will hit its leverage constraint and consequently be taken over by creditors. When Distanceto-Margin-Call hits zero, the leverage hits the Pingcang Line and the creditor takes over the account.
In theories such as Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) and Garleanu and Pedersen (2011), costly
forced sales occur if leverage exceeds the account's Pingcang Line and the account is taken over by
the creditor. Forward-looking investors will sell as the account's leverage approaches its Pingcang

6

Line due to precautionary motives.

We nd strong empirical support for these theories in the

data. After controlling for account xed eects and stock-date xed eects, we nd that the selling
intensities of all stocks are negatively related to the account's Distance-to-Margin-Call. The eect
is non-linear, and increases sharply when the Distance-to-Margin-Call edges toward zero.
The signicant negative relationship between selling intensity and Distance-to-Margin-Call identies leverage-induced re sales in our paper. We further note that this negative relationship can be
driven by (1) leverage constraints, i.e. forced and preemptive sales that occur when leverage nears
the maximum leverage limit and (2) a portfolio rebalancing motive in which risk-averse investors
actively delever after a drop in asset values induces an increase in leverage. Thus, leverage-induced
re sales in our setting should be viewed as a combination of these two widely-accepted economic
forces: one consists of pre-emptive and forced sales due to leverage constraints and the other is
a rebalancing motive that could occur even in the absence of leverage constraints.

We provide

several tests that rule in a strong leverage constraint eect, although we do not rule out an additional leverage eect. First, we show that the ratio of leverage to the Pingcang line matters for

In static models such as Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) and Geanakoplos (2010), re sales only occur when

accounts hit the leverage constraint (the Pingcang Line).

However, in a dynamic setting such as Garleanu and

Pedersen (2011), forward looking investors will start to sell before hitting the constraint, knowing that the controlling
creditors who only aim to recover their debt claims will dump the stock holdings by ignoring price impact. Investors'
precautionary selling prior to hitting the leverage constraint can also be explained by runs in nancial markets, as
illustrated by Bernardo and Welch (2004), which is similar in spirit to the bank-run mechanism in Diamond and
Dybvig (1983), Goldstein and Pauzner (2005), and recently He and Xiong (2012)).

selling behavior, even after we exibly control for the account's level of leverage, and proxy for the
Pingcang Line (which may be endogenously determined) using the average Pingcang Line for all
accounts opened on the same day as the account in question. We also nd that the announcement
of regulations that would tighten leverage constraints for shadow-nanced margin accounts led to
large upward jumps in selling intensities for shadow accounts (and not for brokerage accounts), with
especially large jumps for accounts with Distance-to-Margin-Calls closer to zero.
We nd evidence of strong interactions between leverage-induced selling, market movements, and
stock market trading restrictions.

The relation between Distance-to-Margin-Call and net selling

is two to three times stronger on days when the market is down rather than up.

This result

underscores how leverage-induced re sales in specic stocks feed into and are fed by broad market
crashes. As more margin accounts face leverage constraints, investors will seek to deleverage their
holdings, which will contribute to a market decline. As the market declines, leverage constraints
tighten further, causing investors to intensify their selling activities. We also nd that government
announcements aimed at curbing excessive leverage may have intensied leverage-induced selling
in the short run, triggering market-wide crashes. Further, government-mandated price limits that
restricted trading for individual stocks beyond a within-day price change of 10% had the unintended
consequence of exacerbating re sales crashes in other stocks that were not protected by the price
limits. We nd that investors seeking to deleverage signicantly intensify their selling of unprotected
stocks if other stocks in their portfolios cannot be sold due to stock-specic price limits.
We then show that stocks that are disproportionately held by margin accounts with low Distanceto-Margin-Calls experience high selling pressure. We classify accounts whose Distance-to-MarginCall is below a threshold as re sale accounts.

We then construct a stock-date level measure

of re sale exposure, which measures the fraction of shares outstanding held by re sale accounts
within our sample of margin accounts. We nd that stocks with higher re sale exposure experience
signicantly more net selling volume from re sale accounts.
Next, we explore the asset pricing implications of leverage-induced re sales. Following Coval
and Staord (2007), we test the prediction that re sales should cause price drops that revert in
the long run. In our setting, selling pressure from margin accounts close to their Pingcang Lines
can cause re sales if there is insucient liquidity to absorb the selling pressure.
then revert back when liquidity returns to the market.

Prices should

To test this prediction, we do not use

the actual trading choices of re sale accounts, as investors may exercise endogenous discretion
in the choice of which stocks within their portfolios to sell.

4

Following Edmans et al. (2012), we

instead look at the pricing patterns for stocks with high re sale exposure, i.e., stocks that are
disproportionately held by margin accounts with leverage close to their Pingcang Lines. We nd
that stocks with high re sale exposure signicantly underperform stocks with low re sale exposure,
but these dierences approach zero in the long run. Stocks in the top decile of re sale exposure
underperform stocks in the bottom decile by approximately 5 percentage points within 10 to 15
trading days, and the dierence in performance reverts toward zero within 30 to 40 trading days.
To better identify a causal eect of re sales on asset prices, we also conduct an event study showing
that the relation between FSE and stock returns became signicantly stronger immediately after
a regulatory tightening announcement aimed at curbing shadow margin trading. We further show
that the long-run reversal should not be attributed solely to a large-scale government bailout which
began on July 6, 2015. While the government bailout may have helped stem the aggregate decline in
the market, the government did not disproportionately purchase stocks with high re sale exposure;
we nd the correlations between government purchases and stocks' re sale exposures at dierent
lags are economically small (below 4%) and sometimes even negative.
Finally, our unique data allows us to perform the following forensic-style analysis: Which margin
trading system, brokerage or shadow, played a more important role in the stock market crash? The
answer to this question is important from a policy perspective because it can shape the focus of
future regulatory oversight. Although practitioners, the media, and regulators have mainly pointed
their ngers at shadow-nanced margin accounts, the answer to this question is not obvious. First,
according to many estimates, total market assets held within the regulated brokerage-nanced system greatly exceeded that in the unregulated shadow-nanced system. Second, brokerage-nanced
margin accounts have a lower Pingcang Line that is uniformly imposed by the CSRC. Thus, even
though brokerage accounts have lower leverage on average, these accounts may also be closer to
hitting leverage constraints.
We nd that the data supports the view that shadow-nanced margin accounts contributed
more to the market crash.

The leverage of brokerage accounts remained low, even relative to

their tighter Pingcang Lines. There were also far fewer stock holdings in re sale accounts within
the brokerage-nanced system than within the shadow-nanced system.

Further, a measure of

re sale exposure constructed from the shadow accounts data sample predicts price declines and
subsequent reversals much more strongly than a similar re sale exposure measure constructed from
the brokerage accounts data sample.
Overall, we nd strong empirical evidence that leverage-induced re sales, originating primarily

5

in the FinTech-fueled shadow sector and participated mainly by retail investors, contributed to the
Chinese stock market crash of 2015. We caution that our results do not imply that re sales were
the ultimate cause of the large and persistent drop in the value of the Chinese stock market (the
SSE index fell from a high of over 5000 in early June of 2015 to below 3000, and has stagnated in
the low 3000s in the subsequent three years). The lack of a full recovery in the years after the crash
is consistent with Chinese markets being fundamentally overvalued in the rst half of 2015. While
we cannot know the counterfactual with certainty, it is possible that the Chinese stock market
would have experienced an eventual correction, even without the trigger of leverage-induced re
sales. Our evidence does suggest that re sales contributed to the correction taking the form of a
rapid crash in the days immediately following a regulatory announcement aimed at curbing shadow-

7

nanced margin trading.

Our cross-sectional evidence also shows that stocks disproportionately

held by highly-leveraged margin accounts experienced larger percentage declines relative to other
stocks, and that the gap between stocks with high versus low re sale exposure closed once liquidity
returned to the market.

Our ndings parallel common narratives concerning the US 1929 stock

8

market crash (e.g., Schwert (1989)).

Like the Chinese 2015 crash, the US 1929 crash was followed

by many years of market stagnation, consistent with a story of fundamental overvaluation and
eventual correction.

However, deleveraging and re sales by margin traders contributed to the

correction taking the form of dramatic single-day point drops during the summer of 1929.

Related Literature

Our paper is related to the large literature on re sales in various asset

markets including the stock market, housing market, derivatives market, and even markets for real
assets (e.g., aircraft). In a seminal paper by Shleifer and Vishny (1992), the authors argue that asset
re sales are possible when nancial distress clusters at the industry level, as the natural buyers of
the asset are nancially constrained as well. Pulvino (1998) tests this theory by studying commercial
aircraft transactions initiated by (capital) constrained versus unconstrained airlines, and Campbell
et al. (2011) documents re sales in local housing market due to events such as foreclosures. In the
context of nancial markets, Coval and Staord (2007) show the existence of re sales by studying
open-end mutual fund redemptions and the associated non-information-driven sales; Mitchell et al.

7

Indeed, an earlier Chinese stock market boom in 2007/08 which ended with a much slower downward correction

is consistent with the view that margin trading contributes to rapid crashes, as margin trading was introduced in the
Chinese stock market only after 2010 (Andrade et al., 2013).

8

The Introduction of Schwert (1989) discusses the similarity between the 1987 and 1929 crashes in the US stock

market, noting that regulators feared that cheap credit allowed over-enthusiatic speculators to bid up stock prices,
creating the potential for a crash as prices reverted down to lower (presumably more rational) levels. Similar fears
were expressed in the Congressional hearings that followed the 1929 crash.

6

(2007) investigate the price reaction of convertible bonds around hedge fund redemptions; Ellul et al.
(2011) show that downgrades of corporate bonds may induce regulation-driven selling by insurance
companies. Recently, re sales have been documented in the market for residential mortgage-backed
securities (Merrill et al. (2016)) and minority equity stakes in publicly-listed third parties (Dinc et al.
(2017)).
It is worth emphasizing that, although re sales can be triggered by many economic forces, the
seminal paper by Shleifer and Vishny (1992) and the subsequent theory literature focus on the force
of deleveraging. Meanwhile, the existing empirical evidence has not focused on leverage-induced re
sales, which have the additional feature of a downward leverage spiral. In this regard, our paper
diers from the previous empirical literature by documenting a direct link between leverage, selling
behavior, and re sales, with the aid of account-level leverage and trading data. Our paper also
diers from previous empirical work on nancial markets which has mostly focused on re sales
in specic subsets of nancial securities. We show how leverage-induced re sales play a role in a
broad stock market crash.
Our paper also contributes to the literature on the role of funding constraints, specically margin
and leverage, in asset pricing. Theoretical contributions such as Kyle and Xiong (2001), Gromb and
Vayanos (2002), Danielsson et al. (2002), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), and Garleanu and
Pedersen (2011) help academics and policymakers understand these linkages in the aftermath of the
recent global nancial crisis.
constraints to asset prices.

There is also an empirical literature that connects various funding

Our paper follows a similar vein of investigating funding constraints

tied to the market making industry (e.g., Comerton-Forde et al. (2010) and Hameed et al. (2010),
among others).
Our paper is most closely related to the empirical literature which explores the asset pricing
implications of stock margins and related regulations.

Margin requirements were rst imposed

by Congress through the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

Congress's rationale at the time

was that credit-nanced speculation in the stock market may lead to excessive price volatility
through a pyramiding-depyramiding process.

Indeed, Hardouvelis (1990) nds that a tighter

margin requirement is associated with lower volatility in the US stock market. This is consistent
with an underlying mechanism in which tighter margin requirements discourage optimistic investors
from taking speculative positions (this mechanism also seems to t unsophisticated retail investors

9

Another important strand of the literature explores heterogeneous portfolio constraints in a general equilibrium

asset pricing model and its macroeconomic implications, which features an equity constraint, for instance, Basak
and Cuoco (1998); He and Krishnamurthy (2013); Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014).

7

in the Chinese stock market). Hardouvelis and Theodossiou (2002) further show that the relation
between margin requirements and volatility only holds in bull and normal markets. This nding
points to the potential benet of margin credit, in that it essentially relaxes funding constraints.
This trade-o is cleanly tested in a recent paper by Tookes and Kahraman (2016), which shows the
causal impact of margin on stock liquidity using a regression discontinuity design comparing stocks
on either side of a margin eligibility regulatory threshold.
There are several concurrent academic articles investigating the Chinese stock market boom and
subsequent crash in the summer of 2015. In contrast with our analysis, most of the other studies use
stock-level data rather than account-level brokerage and shadow margin trading data, e.g., Huang
et al. (2016) and Chen et al. (2017). Using account-level data, but without a focus on margin trading
or shadow nancing, Huang et al. (2018) study trading suspensions that are discretionally chosen by
the listed companies themselves. Focusing on the staggered liberalization of stock-margin lending
and the associated market boom before 2015, Hansman et al. (2018) quantify the price impact
due to the expectations of future margin-driven price increases. Our analysis and conclusions are
complementary to a companion paper by Bian et al. (2018a), which uses the same dataset on
margin traders in the Chinese stock market in 2015. Bian et al. (2018a) focus on contagion among
stocks held in the same leveraged margin accounts and how the magnitude of the contagion can
be amplied through increased account leverage. Bian et al. (2018a) also show that this withinaccount contagion can be further transmitted across account networks, again amplied by leverage.
In contrast, this paper aims to provide direct evidence of leverage-induced re sales, which itself
does not require contagion (although contagion can, of course, feed and be fed by re sales). This
paper also diers from Bian et al. (2018a), because our analysis centers on the dierence between the
two types of margin accounts, regulated brokerage accounts and unregulated shadow accounts. Our
ndings concerning the unique nature of shadow-nancing may help researchers and policymakers
understand the role of regulation in the informal nance sector.

2.1

Margin Trading during the Chinese Stock Market Crash of 2015

The Chinese stock market experienced a dramatic increase in the rst half of 2015, followed by an
unprecedented crash in the middle of 2015. The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) composite index
started from around 3100 in January 2015, peaked at 5166 in mid-June, and then free-fell to 3663
at the end of July 2015. It is widely believed that high levels of margin trading and the subsequent
re sales induced by the de-leveraging process were the main driving forces of the market crash.
There were two kinds of margin trading accounts active in the Chinese stock market during
this time period. One is brokerage-nanced and the other is shadow-nanced, as shown in Figure
1, which depicts the structure and funding sources for the two margin trading systems.

10

Both

accounts were nonexistent prior to 2010, but thrived after 2014 alongside the surge in the Chinese
stock market. In what follows, we describe these two types of margin accounts in detail. Throughout
the paper, whenever there is no risk of confusion, we use brokerage (shadow) accounts to refer to
brokerage-nanced (shadow-nanced) margin accounts.

2.2

Brokerage-Financed Margin Accounts

Margin trading through brokerage rms was rst introduced to the Chinese stock market in 2010.
After its introduction, margin trading remained unpopular until around June 2014 when brokeragenanced debt began to grow exponentially. According to public data on exchanges, the total debt
held by brokerage-nanced margin accounts sat at 0.4 trillion Yuan in June 2014, but more than
quintupled to around 2.2 trillion Yuan within one year. This amounted to approximately 3-4% of
the total market capitalization of China's stock market in mid-June 2015, similar to the relative
size of margin nancing in the US and other developed markets.
Brokerage-nanced margin trades represented a highly protable business for brokerage rms.
Brokers usually provide margin nancing by issuing short-term bonds in China's interbank market
or borrowing from the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC) at a rate slightly higher than
the interbank rate.

11

Brokers then lend these funds to margin borrowers at an annual rate of

approximately 8-9%, who then combine their own equity funds to purchase stocks (the left side of

10

In Chinese, they are called Chang-Nei fund matching and Chang-Wai fund matching, which literally means

on-site and o-site nancing.

In a companion paper by Bian et al. (2018a), whose analysis is based on the

same data set as our paper, shadow-nanced is called peer-nanced, which emphasizes that margin credit can be
supplied via either formal institutions like brokerage rms or informal lending providers like wealthy individuals.

With a risk-free rate of around 4% during our sample period, this business

oered brokers higher prots than commissions, which were only about 4 basis points (or 0.04%) of
trading volumes.
Almost all brokerage-nanced margin account holders in China are retail investors.

13

Due to

concerns of potential trading frenzies from household investors, the regulatory body of the Chinese
securities market, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), sets high qualication
standards for investors to engage in brokerage-nanced margin trading. A qualied investor needs
to have a trading account with the broker for at least 18 months, with a total account value (cash
and stockholdings combined) exceeding 0.5 million Yuan.
The minimum initial margin set by the CSRC is 50%, implying that investors can borrow at most
50% of asset value when they open their brokerage accounts. More importantly for our analysis,
the CSRC also imposes a minimum margin, which requires that every brokerage account maintains
its debt below 1/1.3 of its current total asset value (cash + stock holdings). Once the debt-to-asset
ratio of a margin account increases above 1/1.3, and if borrowers fail to inject equity to reduce the
account's debt-to-asset ratio the next day, the account will be taken over by the brokerage rm.
In China, practitioners call this maximum allowable leverage ratio, which equals

1.3/(1.3 − 1) = 4.33,

the Pingcang Line, which means forced settlement line.

Asset/Equity =
Brokerage rms

have discretion to set dierent Pingcang Lines for their customers, as long as the line lies below this
regulatory maximum of 4.33. However, we do not observe any instances of a lowered maximum allowable leverage limit in our sample, which is from one of the leading brokerage rms in China. This
suggests that the CSRC has been quite stringent in regulating the brokerage-nancing business.

14

Once the account leverage exceeds the Pingcang Line, control of the account reverts to the lender
(the brokerage rm).

12

The lender then has discretion to sell assets without borrower permission,

13

The regulatory body CSRC banned professional institutional investors from conducting margin trades through

brokers in China.

14

Besides regulating leverage, the CSRC also mandated that only the most liquid stocks (usually blue-chips) were

marginable, i.e., eligible for investors to obtain margin nancing.

However, this regulation only aected margin

buying when the accounts were rst opened. Investors were able to use cash from previous sales to buy other nonmarginable stocks, as long as their accounts remained below the Pingcang Line. In our data, 23% of stock holdings
in brokerage accounts are non-marginable stocks during the week of June 8-12, 2015 (the week leading up to the
crash). When the prices of stock holdings in a leveraged brokerage account fell, the leverage rose, and the account
engaged in either preemptive sales to avoid approaching the Pingcang Line or forced sales after it was taken over after
crossing the Pingcang Line. Regardless of the situation, investors sold both marginable and non-marginable stocks,
rendering the initial margin eligibility of the stocks largely irrelevant when we study the role of leverage-induced re
sales in the stock market crash. Moreover, shadow-nanced margin accounts were not regulated and could always
buy non-marginable stocks on margin.

10

and generally sells all assets very aggressively without regard for price impact or execution costs
(see Footnote 32 for a detailed discussion of creditor incentives to liquidate assets). This aggressive
selling may help the lender recover debt at the expense of the remaining equity value of the borrower.
Therefore, borrowers may actively delever before hitting the Pingcang Line to avoid potential equity
losses once the lender seizes control.

2.3

Shadow-Financed Margin Accounts

During the rst half of 2015, aided by the burgeoning FinTech industry in China, many Chinese
retail investors engaged in margin trading via the shadow-nancing system, in addition to, or instead
of, the brokerage-nancing system. Shadow-nanced margin trading started attracting investors in
2014, alongside the rapid growth of the FinTech industry in China. The shadow-nancing system,
similar to many nancial innovations in history, existed in a regulatory gray area. Shadow-nancing
was not initially regulated by the CSRC, and lenders did not require borrowers to have a minimum
level of asset wealth or trading history to qualify for borrowing. In turn, shadow-nanced borrowers
paid higher interest rates of around 11-14%, which are 3-5 percentage points higher than their
counterparts in the brokerage-nanced market.
Shadow-nancing usually operated through a web-based trading platform which provided various

15

service functions that facilitated trading and borrowing.

The typical platform featured a mother-

child dual account structure, with each mother account oering trading access to many (in most
cases, hundreds of ) child accounts.

Panel B of Figure 1 depicts such a mother-child structure.

The mother account (the middle box) is connected to a distinct trading account registered in a
brokerage rm with direct access to stock exchanges (the top box). The mother account belongs
to the creditor, usually a professional nancing company.

Each mother account is connected to

multiple child accounts, and each child account is managed by an individual retail margin trader
(the bottom boxes).
On the surface, a mother account appears to be a normal unlevered brokerage account, albeit
with unusually large asset holdings and trading volume. In reality, these large brokerage accounts
were mother accounts, which used a FinTech software program to transmit the orders submitted
by associated child accounts in real time to stock exchanges. As shown, the professional nancing
company which manages the mother account provides margin credit to child accounts; its funding

15

HOMS, MECRT, and Royal Flush were the three leading electronic margin trading platforms in China during

2015.

11

sources include its own capital as mezzanine nancing as well as borrowing from China's shadow
banking sector. Through this umbrella-style structure, a creditor can lend funds to multiple margin
traders, while maintaining dierent leverage limits for each trader (child account).
Similar to brokerage-nanced margin accounts, a child account in the shadow-nanced margin
system had a maximum allowable leverage limiti.e., the Pingcang Linebeyond which the child
account would be taken over by the mother account (the creditor), triggering forced sales. Often,
this switch of ownership was automated through the software system, by simply triggering the
expiration of the borrower's password and immediate activation of that of the creditor.
Unlike the brokerage-nanced margin system, there were no regulations concerning the maximum
allowable leverage for each child account.

Instead, the creditor (the mother account) and the

borrower/investor negotiated the maximum allowable leverage limit for each account, resulting in
account-specic Pingcang Lines for shadow accounts. The Pingcang Line never changes during the
life of an account. In our sample, unregulated shadow accounts have much higher Pingcang Lines on
average than their regulated brokerage peers (see Table 1). Just as with brokerage-nanced market
accounts, control of the account reverts to the creditor (the mother account) once leverage exceeds
the Pingcang Line. The mother account generally sells assets aggressively without regard for price
impact or execution costs. As a result, foresighted borrowers may delever in a precautionary way,
by actively selling before hitting the Pingcang Line to avoid potential losses once the lender seizes
control.
Whereas funding for brokerage accounts came from either the brokerage rm's own borrowed
funds or from borrowing through the CSFC, funding for shadow-nanced margin accounts came from
a broader set of sources that are directly, or indirectly, linked to the shadow banking system in China.
The right hand side of Figure 1 Panel A lists these sources of credit. Besides the capital injection
by nancing companies who were running the shadow-nanced margin business and equity from
shadow margin traders, the three major funding sources were Wealth Management Products (WMP)
raised from depositors via commercial banks, Trust and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) informal lending, and
borrowing through pledged stock rights.
As suggested by the gray color on the right hand side of Figure 1 Panel A, the shadow-nanced
margin system operated in the shadow.

Regulators do not know the detailed breakdown of the

shadow funding sources and therefore do not know the exact leverage ratio associated with this
system, let alone the total size of the shadow-nancing market.

According to a research report

issued by Huatai Securities, just before the stock market collapse in June 2015, borrowing from WMP

12

peaked at around 600 billion Yuan and P2P informal lending peaked at about 200 billion Yuan.

16

For pledged stock rights, there is much less agreement on how much borrowing through pledged
stock rights owed back to the stock market; we gauge 250-500 billion Yuan to be a reasonable
estimate.

17

Summing up, the estimated total debt held by shadow-nanced margin accounts was

about 1.0-1.4 trillion Yuan at its peak, consistent with the estimates provided by China Securities
Daily on June 12, 2015.

Lack of Regulation over Shadow-Financed Margin Accounts

The Chinese stock market stagnated for several years after the crisis of 2008 and began rapidly
rising around the middle of 2014.

Recent research has argued that a major cause of the market

boom without corresponding real sector growth was leverage-fueled margin trading.

19

Although the

government and professional traders warned that the stock market run-up may represent a bubble,
new investors continued to rush into the market and the index grew by 60% from the beginning to
the mid of 2015.
As explained in the previous section, the shadow-nancing market was unregulated during our
sample period. Shadow-nanced margin investors could purchase any stock using margin as long
as the total account leverage did not exceed the account-specic Pingcang Line, without any regulation on the Pingcang Line itself.

While the shadow-nancing market remained unregulated

in the rst half of 2015, many investors and media outlets believed that the CSRC would release
regulatory guidelines in the near future. For instance, on May 22, 2015, newspapers reported that
the government had asked several leading broker/securities rms to engage in self-examinations of
services provided to shadow-nanced margin accounts, and that providers of these illegal activities had received warnings from the CSRC as early as March 13, 2015.

20

On June 12, 2015, the

CSRC released a set of draft rules that would strength the self-examinations of services provided

16

These estimates are given in Figure 1 of the report issued by Huatai Securities on July 5th, 2015, which is

available at https://wenku.baidu.com/view/565390bd43323968001c9234?pcf=2.

17

A pledge of stock rights in China is an agreement in which the borrower pledges the stocks as a collateral to

obtain credit, often from commercial banks, for real investment. It is illegal to use borrowed funds to invest in the
stock market, though, during the rst half of 2015, it was reported that some borrowers lent these borrowed funds to
professional lending rms who then lent them out to shadow-nanced margin traders to purchase stocks. Given the
total borrowing of 2.5 trillion Yuan through pledged stock rights in early June 2015, we estimate that about 10-20%
of the borrowing owed back to the stock market.

to shadow-nanced margin accounts and explicitly ban new shadow-nanced margin accounts.

A month-long stock market crash started the next trading day on Monday, June 15, 2015, wiping
out almost 40% of the market index. In response, the Chinese government began to aggressively
purchase stocks to support prices around July 6, 2015, and the market stabilized in mid-September
2015. In this paper, we show that leverage-induced selling pressure by margin investors, especially
shadow-nanced margin investors, led to widespread re sales that contributed to the crash in the
interim period of June and July 2015.

2.5

Trading Regulations

Chinese regulators had several trading regulation policies in place during our sample period of
May-July 2015, generally with the goal of reducing market turbulence. First, while there were no

22

stock-specic or market-wide automatic trading suspension triggers,

listed rms could apply for

trading suspensions with a typical length of days or weeks. These applications were actively used
by rms that were concerned about continuously dropping market values, and the CSRC often
approved these applications.

23

In the main analysis, we impute stock returns for days in which a

stock experienced trading suspensions, based on the stock's previous closing price and next opening
price; our results are robust to this treatment as shown in Section 5.3.
Second, Chinese regulators enforced a daily 10-percent rule (see e.g., Chen et al. (2018b) for a
detailed analysis). Under this rule, each individual stock was allowed to move a daily maximum of
10 percent from the previous closing level in either direction, before triggering a price limit. Once
triggered, all trades at prices beyond the limit was prohibited. For example, if the previous day's
closing price was $10, and today's price dropped to $9, the price limit would be triggered, and the
stock could not trade at less than $9. While the stock could technically continue trading within
the 10 percent range, the de factco consequence of a triggered price limit was often a near-complete
halt in trading for the aected stock. In later analysis, we explore whether these price limits may
have had the unintended consequence of exacerbating re sales crashes in other stocks that were
not protected by the price limits.

suspended it immediately at the end of that week. For details and a thorough theoretical analysis, see Chen et al.

Data and Summary Statistics

In this section, we start by describing our data samples.

We then dene account leverage, and

show that, during our sample period, leverage is highly countercyclical with the market index, with
signicant cross-account heterogeneity.

We then dene each account's Distance-to-Margin-Call,

which measures the tightness of the leverage constraint that each account faces at the start of each
day. Finally, we discuss summary statistics for our data sample.

3.1

Data

We use a mixture of proprietary and public data from several sources. The rst dataset contains the
complete equity holdings, cash balances, and trading records of all accounts from a leading brokerage
rm in China. This brokerage rm is one of the largest brokers in China, with 5.5% of the market
share in the brokerage business in 2015. This sample contains data on nearly ve million accounts,
over 95% of which are retail accounts.

Approximately 180,000 of these accounts are eligible for

brokerage-nanced margin trading, hereafter referred to as brokerage-nanced margin accounts or
brokerage accounts. After the data cleaning, the total credit to these brokerage-nanced margin
accounts represents about 5% of the outstanding brokerage margin credit to the entire stock market
in China. The remaining accounts are unleveraged, non-margin brokerage accounts, which we use
in some analyses to form a control group.
The second dataset contains all trading and holding records of more than 300,000 investor
accounts from a large web-based trading platform in China, i.e., shadow-nanced margin accounts
or shadow accounts.

After applying lters to focus on active accounts (with details provided in

Appendix A), we retain a nal sample of a little over 150,000 shadow accounts, with total debt
reaching 56 billion Yuan in June 2015. For comparison, recall that Section 2.3 estimates that the
debt associated with shadow accounts peaked at around 1-1.4 trillion Yuan, implying that our
sample covers approximately 5% of the shadow-nanced margin system.
As discussed previously, a key advantage of these two datasets is that we observe the assets and
debt of each margin account, and hence its leverage on each trading day.

24

An implicit assumption in

our analysis is that both data samples are representative of the two margin-based nancing systems
in China. Though it is impossible to verify the representativeness of our sample of shadow-nanced

24

We observe end-of-day debt levels for all brokerage-nanced margin accounts and about half of shadow-nanced

margin accounts. For the remaining shadow-nanced margin accounts, we infer daily debt levels from their initial debt
and subsequent cash ows between these shadow child accounts and their associated lending mother accounts.
See Appendix A for details.

15

margin accounts (we are among the rst to analyze detailed shadow-nanced margin trading data),
we can verify the representativeness of our brokerage sample.

We nd that the cross-sectional

correlation in trading volume between our brokerage sample and the entire market is about 94%,
suggesting the high representativeness of our brokerage sample.

25

In addition to the two proprietary

account-level datasets, we obtain daily closing prices, trading volume, stock returns and other stock
characteristics from the WIND database, which is widely regarded as the leading vendor for Chinese
market data.

equal to total assets minus total debt. Under this denition, an account with zero debt has

leverage equal to 1.
As explained previously, the Pingcang Line is the maximum leverage the investor can hold
before control of the account is transferred to the creditor (either the brokerage rm or the mother
account). When leverage nears the Pingcang Line, the investor will receive a margin call, requiring
her to either add more equity or liquidate her portfolio holdings to repay the debt. If the investor
does not lower the account leverage after receiving a margin call, her account will be taken over
by the creditor.

The creditor then has discretion over all the trading decisions of the account.

26

To reduce the inuence of these outliers, we cap leverage at 100 in our analysis; this treatment is
mostly innocuous as our main analysis allows for exible non-parametric estimation with respect to
the measure of leverage.
Panel A of Figure 2 plots the equity-weighted-average leverage for the brokerage- and shadow-

25

For each trading day, we calculate the cross-sectional correlation in each stock's trading volume between the

brokerage sample and the entire market; we then average across all trading days from May to July in 2015.

26

Although the creditor generally liquidates stock holdings aggressively for debt repayment after gaining control,

the creditor may be unable to sell due to daily 10% price limits or trading suspensions, leading to cases in which the
account leverage increases far beyond the Pingcang Line. More specically, stock prices may continue to drop by -10%
every day before the sell orders can be executed (simply because there are no buyers at these price limits). There
were also trading suspensions for many stocks during our sample period. In these situations, the market prices of
these stocks are frozen, leaving the leverage of the holding account unchanged. We exclude these latter observations
with trading suspensions in identifying re sale accounts in Section 4.1.

16

nanced margin account samples, together with the SSE composite index, which is widely used
as the representative market index in China.

By weighting each account's leverage by equity in

each account, the resulting average leverage is equal to total brokerage- or shadow-nanced margin
account assets scaled by total brokerage- or shadow-nanced margin account equity, respectively.
We observe that during the three-month period from May to July 2015, the leverage of shadow
accounts uctuates more dramatically than that of brokerage accounts.

But the gure does not

imply that brokerage leverage did not move; the correlation between these two leverage series is
91%. Further, there is a strong negative correlation between both leverage series and the SSE index
(-84% for shadow and -68% for brokerage). When the stock index began to plummet in the middle
of June, shadow leverage grew and hit its peak at around July 10th, when SSE index reached its
lowest point. Overall, Panel A of Figure 2 shows that leverage displays signicant counter-cyclical

27

trends and across-account-type heterogeneity.

We can also contrast the equity-weighted average level of leverage (shown in the previous gure)
with the asset-weighted average level of leverage in the market.

Highly leveraged accounts, by

denition, have very little equity but can control a substantial amount of assets. Panel B of Figure
2 shows that, relative to the equity-weighted average, asset-weighted levels of leverage were much
higher throughout our sample period and sharply increased toward a high of almost 7-to-1 when
the market crashed. This contrast illustrates the fact that highly leveraged accounts with very little
equity controlled a growing portion of market assets during the market crash.

3.3

Distance-to-Margin-Call (DMC)

Our analysis will be based on an account-date-level measure that captures the re-sale risk of
each margin-nanced account at the start of each trading day.

In the spirit of the Distance-to-

Default measure in the Merton (1974) credit risk model, we calculate the size of the negative shock
to the asset value of the stock portfolio held by each account that would be enough to push the
account leverage to its Pingcang Line and trigger the control shift from margin investors to creditors

27

There are two forces that drives the dynamics of leverage when asset prices uctuate. The rst is the passive

valuation eect, which drives leverage up when asset prices fall, by the denition of leverage (assets/(assets-debt));
this leads leverage to be counter-cyclical (e.g., He and Krishnamurthy (2013); Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014)).
The second is the active deleveraging eect, in which investors respond to the negative fundamental shock by selling
more assets, which contributes to pro-cyclical leverage.

Clearly, pro-cyclical leverage requires a stronger active

deleveraging eect, so much so that the resulting leverage goes down with falling asset prices (e.g., Fostel and
Geanakoplos (2008); Geanakoplos (2010), and Adrian and Shin (2013)). He et al. (2017) discuss these two forces in
various asset pricing models in detail, and explains why the rst valuation eect often dominates in general equilibrium
and hence counter-cyclical leverage ensues.

In our sample, the rst valuation eect is empirically stronger, which

explains the counter-cyclical leverage pattern in Panel A of Figure 2.

In words, the account's Distance-to-Margin-Call (DMC) equals the number of standard deviations

necessary to push the current level of leverage up to its Pingcang Line. The Pingcang Line never
changes over the life of account. Hence

Lev j

has no date-t subscript, and an account's DMC varies

over time due to changes in its leverage and asset volatility.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of DMC for each day, pooling together the brokerage and shadow
samples; for ease of illustration, we plot the log of DMC, i.e.,

ln Z .

A key advantage of our analysis

is that we can exploit the within-day heterogeneity in DMC across leveraged margin accounts. We
observe a qualitatively similar pattern for the severity of leverage constraints: the upper percentile
lines (50th and 80th) remain relatively at throughout the sample period, whereas the 10th and
20th percentile lines dropped dramatically when the market index plummeted.

3.4

Summary Statistics

Table 1 reports summary statistics for our data sample. We separately report statistics for observations at the account-day, account-stock-day, and stock-day levels, where each day is a trading day.
In addition, we report statistics separately for the brokerage- and shadow-nanced margin account
samples. Consistent with Panel A of Figure 2, we nd average leverage in shadow accounts is more
than four times larger than that in brokerage accounts. Shadow accounts also display substantially
greater dispersion in leverage, with a standard deviation of 12.8 compared to a standard deviation
of 0.5 for brokerage accounts.
In terms of of leverage constraints, the Pingcang Lines of shadow accounts are, on average, three
times larger than the Pingcang Line of 4.3 that applies to all brokerage accounts. However, shadow
accounts are also more likely to face leverage constraints despite their higher leverage limits. This
point is evident from the dierence in DMCs across the two margin-nanced accounts: on average,
the DMC of shadow accounts are about one-fourth of that of brokerage accounts.
We also use data from non-margin brokerage accounts as a benchmark for the trading activity
of unlevered accounts. These accounts have zero debt and hence their leverage is equal to 1. While
these accounts are part of our brokerage dataset, they are not included when we refer to brokerage
accounts which always refer to brokerage-nanced margin accounts.

Empirical Results

In this section, we empirically test how account-level leverage relates to selling pressure, re sales,
and asset prices. We begin by presenting analysis that pools the brokerage- and shadow-nanced
margin account samples.

In later analysis, we will show that the main eects are driven by the

relatively small pool of shadow-nanced margin accounts that faced severe leverage constraints.

19

4.1

Account-Stock-Level Evidence: Leverage-Induced Fire Sales

We expect that the selling intensity of each trading account increases as its Distance-to-MarginCall nears zero. A general feature of a portfolio choice problem with nancial constraints is that
forward-looking agents who are averse to losing control of their trading accounts will start selling
their risky holdings in a precautionary way before hitting the leverage constraint. Margin investors
may be averse to hitting the Pingcang Line because creditors will sell stocks aggressively to recover
their debt claims, ignoring execution costs and without regard to potential temporary price declines.
For a more detailed explanation, see footnote 32. As

Z

approaches zero, the investor's risk of losing

control of the account increases, so we expect net selling to increase.

4.1.1 Selling Intensity
We rst show that accounts with tighter leverage constraints, proxied by lower Distance-to-MarginCall (DMC)

Zjt

dened in Eq. (3) as of the start of each trading day, tend to sell more of their

holdings over the course of the day. We sort

The omitted category is bin

0, representing unlevered brokerage accounts (which include all non-margin accounts and margin
accounts that hold zero debt).
The main coecients of interest are the selling intensities

λk 's,

which measure the dierence in

selling intensity within each bin relative to the omitted category of unlevered accounts. It is worth
emphasizing that Eq.

(5) includes stock-date xed eects

νit

and account xed eects

αj .

The

stock-date xed eects control for the possibility that all accounts in our sample may be more likely
to sell a stock on a particular day; essentially, we compare the selling intensities for the same stock
on the same day but sitting in accounts with dierent DMCs. The account xed eects capture the
account-specic unobservable eecte.g., some accounts may be more likely to sell than others on
average during our sample period.
The theory in Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), Geanakoplos (2010), and Garleanu and Pedersen (2011) implies that closeness to margin calls triggers net selling by leveraged accounts. As
a result, we expect the selling intensity

λk

to increase with

k,

i.e., a higher selling intensity for ac-

counts with lower DMCs, in regression (5). Our empirical results strongly support this theoretical
prediction, as shown in Figure 4 which plots selling intensity

λk

for each bin representing DMC.

The regression analogue for the gure is presented in Column 1 of Table 2. Relative to unlevered
accounts, accounts in bin 11 with

Z <0

(these are accounts that have hit the leverage constraint

and have been taken over by lenders) increase net selling by 0.19. This additional selling intensity of
0.19 is equivalent to 60% of a standard deviation in the level of net selling activity across accounts.
Further, these coecients may underestimate the extent to which investors desire to sell, as we
include observations corresponding to stocks with partially limited daily trading due to the daily
10-percent rule.

Fire Sale Accounts

In Figure 4,

λk

is close to zero for accounts that are far away from margin

calls (Z is large), and increases sharply when the DMC edges toward 3. In other words, for the
same stock on the same day, investors begin to intensify their selling (by selling an extra 6.4% of
initial asset holdings relative to unlevered accounts) when a two-to-three standard deviation return
movement would lead to loss of control of their accounts. For this reason, from now on, we refer
to accounts with

Z≤3

as re sale accounts. These accounts are signicantly more likely to face

margin calls and to contribute to re sales of assets. In later tests, we also show that our results

21

are not sensitive to the exact cuto of

Z = 3.

4.1.2 Asymmetry with Respect to Market Conditions
One important prediction of models with leverage-nanced agents is downward leverage spirals (e.g.,
Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)). That is, the magnitude of leverage-induced selling should vary
asymmetrically with market downturns and upturns. Asymmetric behavior with respect to market
performance has been documented by Hameed et al. (2010) and Tookes and Kahraman (2016) in
various related contexts.
The theory predicts that precautionary motives should lead investors that are close to receiving
margin calls to exhibit high selling intensity, even when the aggregate market does well. However,
conditional on a given DMC at the start of day t, leverage constraints will tighten further on average
if the market return over day

t

is negative. Thus, we expect that the relation between DMC and

selling intensity will be stronger if the market return on that day is negative.
Figure 5 and Appendix Table B.1 show how DMC at the start of day

t

conditional on whether the market return is positive or negative on day

aects selling intensity,

t.

Consistent with the

predictions above, we nd that lower DMC leads to higher selling intensity even when market returns
are positive; but the relation between DMC and net selling is two to three times stronger on days
when the market is down. These results underscore how leverage-induced re sales in specic stocks
feed into and are fed by broad market crashes. As more margin accounts face leverage constraints,
investors will seek to deleverage their holdings, which will contribute to a market decline. As the
market declines, leverage constraints tighten further, causing investors to intensify their selling
activities, conditional on each level of DMC.

4.1.3 Leverage and Leverage-to-Pingcang
Recall that we construct the DMC measure as a proxy for the risk of an account being taken over
by the creditor. This risk measure depends on the account leverage, how close the leverage is to
the Pingcang Line, and the asset volatility of its holdings. Eq. (3) essentially combines these three
inputs in a particular structural way. Do our re sale results hold without imposing this structure?
For ease of illustration, we focus on two terms in Eq. (3): leverage and Leverage-to-Pingcang.
Focusing on these two measures also has the advantage of shedding light on the role of leverage
versus leverage constraints (represented by the Pingcang Line), which we discuss further in the next
subsection.

22

Following the format of regression (5), in Table 3 we regress net selling on bins for Leverageto-Pingcang

LPjt

dened in Eq. (4), ve bins for the account's level of leverage, and interactions

between the leverage bins and an indicator for accounts with

LPjt ≤ 0.4

(we choose

0.4

because

selling intensity increases sharply after this cuto ); as before, stock-date xed eects and account
xed eects are included. We focus this analysis on shadow-nanced margin accounts only. This
is because Pingcang Lines vary across accounts in the shadow sample, allowing us to separately
identify the eects of Leverage-to-Pingcang, leverage, and potential interactions. In contrast, the
brokerage sample has the same Pingcang Line across accounts, so there is a one-to-one mapping
between leverage and Leverage-to-Pingcang.
First, we nd that Leverage-to-Pingcang, as a proxy for the leverage constraint, predicts higher
selling intensity, after controlling for leverage. Moreover, the coecients for the interaction between
leverage bins and the leverage constraint (the indicator for accounts with
increasing in leverage.

LP ≤ 0.4)

are generally

This positive interaction term lends support to the theoretical reasoning

underlying the construction of the DMC in Eq. (3).

30

4.1.4 Economic Mechanisms
This section investigates complementary mechanisms for the negative empirical relation between
DMC and account selling intensity in Figure 4. It is worth emphasizing again that, since we control
for stock-date and account xed eects in our baseline specication, this strong negative relation
cannot be explained by any mechanisms that only varies at the stock-date or account level.

Leverage and/or Leverage Constraint?

We dene the negative relation between DMC and

net selling as leverage-induced re sales. These re sales can result from two related forces. First,
leverage constraints could lead to both forced sales when control shifts from investors to creditors
once leverage exceeds the Pingcang Line, as well as precautionary sales in which investors delever to
avoid hitting the Pingcang Line. Second, leverage itself, even in the absence of nancing constraints,
may lead risk-averse investors to sell risky stocks for rebalancing purposes (e.g., Merton (1971)).
Because the reciprocal of account leverage enters the DMC measure in Eq. (3), this simple leveragebased rebalancing force in Merton (1971) can also contribute to the negative relation between selling

30

While very high leverage predicts increased net selling, the relation between leverage and net selling seems to

be reversed for the range with low leverage. This empirical pattern is consistent with the view that investors choose
to take on more leverage when they are feeling more bullish and/or speculative and therefore are more likely to buy
rather than sell assets, holding leverage constraints (Leverage-to-Pingcang) constant. However, as leverage constraints
begin to bind, investors become more likely to sell assets if the level of leverage is also high.

23

intensity and DMC documented in Figure 4. Note, a handful of general equilibrium asset pricing
papers, such as Kyle and Xiong (2001) and He and Krishnamurthy (2013), have shown that leverage
itself can play an important role in downturns in nancial markets without leverage constraints.
In our sample, we can rule in the role of leverage constraints by looking at the net selling
activity of accounts with negative DMC (i.e.,
and are engaged in forced sales.

31

Z < 0),

which have been taken over by creditors

Once the creditor gains the control over the trading account, he

generally dumps the stock holdings as soon as possible (subject to daily trading limits) to recover
his debt claims, ignoring any price impact or execution cost triggered by his aggressive selling.

32

In

Section 4.3, we also show that our results are robust to the more conservative treatment in which
we only classify account-date observations with

Z<0

as re sale accounts.

We can further isolate the role of leverage constraints from leverage for accounts in which the
investor remains in control (accounts with

Z > 0).

In other words, we can distinguish precautionary

sales due to fear of hitting a leverage constraint from a simple deleveraging motive. First, Section
4.1.3 takes advantage of the fact that shadow accounts vary in their Leverage-to-Pingcang, holding
the level of leverage constant; in that section, we showed that higher Leverage-to-Pingcang (a tighter
leverage constraint) leads to higher selling intensity after controlling for account-level leverage. This
evidence lends support to the leverage constraint mechanism.
However, a potential concern with the evidence in Section 4.1.3 is that the Pingcang Line is not
randomly assigned to margin investors. There could be endogenous matching of creditors oering
higher or lower Pingcang Lines with investors with heterogeneous risk aversion when opening their
accounts, and this unobserved risk aversion could directly impact selling behavior as accounts near
their leverage constraints.

To address this concern, we use each account's predicted Pingcang

Line, which is more likely to be an exogenous proxy for the account's leverage constraint. Instead

31

Some margin accounts in our sample have leverage signicantly above their Pingcang Lines. These observations

likely correspond to cases in which creditors have gained control, but are unable to immediately sell their holdings
due to daily price limits (the 10-percent-rule). Creditors can sell the stock holdings the next day (within the

±10%

return range), and can also exercise discretion in terms of whether and what to sell.

32

While a creditor will generally prefer to sell aggressively upon gaining control over a trading account, this

intuition may not hold in extreme cases. Suppose that the creditor has a debt claim

D

over the stock held by the

account. In the context of re sales, it is important to distinguish between the market value
post-sale price

A − ∆,

where

∆

A

and the (immediate)

captures the price impact of immediate selling. For example, suppose the Pingcang

A/E = 10,
D = 0.9 · A), the creditor who just gained control is eager to sell the stock and willing to accept any price impact
∆ < 0.1 · A. This is because the creditor only needs to recover D = 0.9 · A for his debt claim, and the loss due to price
Line equals 10, a common value in our shadow account sample. When leverage just hits 10 (implying that

so

impact is borne by the investor (who holds an equity claim). This logic also implies that the creditor will become
more cautious in selling if the account leverage rises further, say 20 (in this situation, the creditor is only willing to
accept a price impact

∆ < 0.05 · A).

Hence, for the very small portion of our sample with leverage far above the

Pingcang Line, selling should become less aggressive, even after the creditor gains control. This empirical prediction
is supported in our data (available upon request).

24

of using each account's actual Pingcang Line (which could result from endogenous matching), we
proxy for the account's leverage constraint using the average Pingcang Line for all accounts opened
on the same day as the account in question.

Variation in average Pingcang Lines over time are

likely to be driven by aggregate funding conditions rather than individual preferences. As shown in
Table 4 which reports the updated regression estimates using this proxy for leverage constraints, we
nd that higher Leverage-to-Predicted-Pingcang bins strongly predict net selling average controlling
exibly for the level of leverage. Consistent with a leverage constraints channel, the basic monotone
pattern with respect to leverage constraints persists even after controlling for account-level leverage.
While the aforementioned tests rule in a leverage constraints channel, we do not rule out the
existence of a leverage channel. The exact distinction between the two channels is less crucial for the
purpose of understanding the role of leverage (margin) and associated re sales during the Chinese
stock market crash. Recall that we refer to the negative relation between selling intensity and DMC
in Figure 4 as leverage-induced re sales. This overall eect can be viewed as the combination of two
economic forces: rebalancing due to leverage, and precautionary and forced sales due to the leverage
constraint. Both forces are rooted in leverage. Because in later sections we are only interested in
the implications of leverage taken by margin accounts and resulting sales as a whole, we leave the
detailed quantitative distinction between the leverage eect and the leverage constraint eect for
future, more structural-based, research.

Regulatory Shocks

Another important economic force that could impact leverage-induced re

sales is regulatory shocks. We now investigate how the selling intensities of brokerage and shadow
accounts dier in their responses to regulatory shocks that occurred before the onset of the market
crash. As mentioned in Section 2.4, two regulatory tightening announcements were made which had
the potential to trigger spikes in the selling intensities of shadow-nanced margin accounts: the May
22 event, in which some brokerage rms were required to self-examine their provision of services
toward shadow-nanced margin accounts, and the June 12 event, in which the CSRC released a set
of draft rules that would explicitly ban new shadow accounts.
For both events, we estimate

λk 's

for the ve trading days before and after the regulatory an-

nouncements, which were released after-hours on Fridays. The results are plotted in Figure 6, and
detailed regression results are presented in Appendix Table B.2. We nd that the two regulatory
announcements led to small and inconsistent changes in the selling intensities for brokerage ac-

25

counts.

33

In contrast, news of regulatory tightening signicantly increased the selling intensities of

shadow accounts within each DMC bin. The June 12 announcement, in particular, led to dramatically higher selling intensities for shadow accounts with DMC below 3. This evidence is consistent
with the widely-held view that news of potential future regulatory tightening triggered re sales by
shadow accounts.
These event studies also help establish a causal link between leverage constraints and selling
pressure from shadow accounts close to margin calls.

The sharp increase in selling intensity by

shadow accounts immediately following these regulatory announcements (and the concurrent muted
reaction by brokerage margin investors) points to the working of leverage constraints because shadow
account investors feared increased constraints due to regulatory oversight.

As with the previous

account-level evidence presented in Figure 4, the regressions for these event studies control for
stock-date and account xed eects, so the empirical patterns cannot be explained by the fact that
low DMC shadow accounts held an unobservably dierent set of stocks or engaged in dierent selling
behaviors on average during the event study sample period.

The Disposition Eect and Leverage: Stabilization vs. Amplication

We also ex-

plore another, more behavioral, explanation. Margin accounts that have recently experienced poor
account-level returns will tend to be accounts with low DMC. Poor account-level returns may directly lead investors to sell, if, for example, investors extrapolate and believe that poor past returns
will persist. This channel is not fully accounted for by the stock-date and account xed eects in
Equation (5), because it operates within an account over time. In supplementary results, shown in
Appendix Table B.3, we nd a similar and slightly stronger relation between DMC and net selling
after also controlling for account-level returns in the past ten days. This occurs because lower past
account-level returns actually predicts lower, not higher, net selling, consistent with the well-known
disposition eect in which investors tend to sell to realize gains and hold on to losers to avoid
realizing losses.
It is interesting to note that this disposition eect tends to stabilize any negative fundamental
shocks, because investors are reluctant to sell to realize losses. Thus, the disposition eect channel
can partly oset the amplication eect due to leverage. These two eects coexist in the Chinese
stock market, although we nd that the latter leverage-amplication eect dominates during our
sample period.

33

There are very few brokerage account observations corresponding to the far right bins representing DMC close

to zero. As a result, the estimated selling intensities for those bins are insignicantly dierent from zero.

26

4.2

Stock-Level Evidence: Fire Sale Exposure and Selling Pressure

Selling pressure occurs when more investors wish to sell a stock than can quickly be absorbed
by investors on the other side, leading to short-term price declines and long-run reversals.

We

hypothesize that stocks that are disproportionately held by margin accounts that have high risk of
hitting their Pingcang Lines, i.e., re sale accounts with DMC
sale risk. To test this hypothesis, we dene stock

and Actual Net Selling

In the following analysis, we purposely do not use the actual trading choices of re sale accounts,
as investors may exercise endogenous discretion in the choice of which stocks within their portfolios
to sell. We instead look at the pricing patterns for stocks with high re sale exposure (i.e., stocks
that are disproportionately held by margin accounts with leverage close to their Pingcang Lines);
see Edmans et al. (2012) for a similar treatment.
One necessary step of this approach is to check whether higher-F SE stocks indeed experience
greater selling by re sale accounts. To check this, we estimate the following regression to examine
the eect of

F SE

on stock-level selling pressure:

δit = β · F SEit + controlsit + si + τt + εit .
Here, we construct the stock-level selling pressure from re sale accounts,

23.5% obtained from a more saturated regression in which we also control for stock and date xed
eects, past returns, and a large set of other time-varying stock characteristics. Thus,

F SEit

can

explain a substantial percentage of the variation in selling pressure from highly-leveraged accounts,
and controlling for additional stock characteristics only marginally adds to the explanatory power
of the regression.
In Figure 7, we plot the net selling by re sale accounts in our sample of margin accounts, as a
percentage of total volume on each calendar day. The sample is restricted stocks in the top decile
of

F SEit ,

calculated as of the start of each day. As expected, we nd that average net selling by

re sale accounts is positive over time. Net selling by re sale accounts also negatively covaries with
the market index, consistent with the idea that poor market returns amplify selling pressure from
re sale accounts. Finally, the gure shows that re sale accounts represent a disproportionately
large percentage of trading volume relative to the amount of assets held within these accounts
(shown later in Figure 10),

34

which motivates our next set of tests which examines the asset pricing

implications of selling pressure from re sale accounts.

Table 6 reports the results when we regress

margin traders.

Finally, investors may be more willing to take highly-levered positions in more

F SE

stocks tend to have greater turnover.

These results suggest that re sale exposure is not randomly assigned across stocks. In the next
section, we will account for non-random assignment when we examine how re sale exposure aects
stock prices.

4.3

Stock-Level Evidence: Fire Sale Exposure and Stock Prices

In this section, we show how re sale exposure aects stock prices. If there is insucient liquidity
in the market to absorb the selling pressure from margin accounts that are close to margin calls, re
sales should cause stock prices to decline in the short run. In the long run, prices should revert to
fundamental value once liquidity returns to the market. Thus, we expect stocks with high
underperform stocks with low

F SE

F SE

to

over the short-run and to revert to similar levels in the long-run,

a pattern that is hard to reconcile with standard frictionless rational settings.
We present two empirical strategies to test this conjecture. For both empirical strategies, we
impute stock returns for days in which the stock experienced an outright trading suspension using
prices before and after, assuming equally-compounded daily returns during the suspension period.
For days in which stocks experienced binding daily price limits of

±10%,

we use the actual return

on that day.

Third, we show that the

tightening announcements.

These regulatory tightening announcements are unlikely to coincide

exactly with negative stock fundamental shocks; rather the announcements likely changed investor
expectations of future leverage constraints, which led to increased re sales for high

35

F SE

stocks.

In previous regression analysis in which we used past returns as a control variable, we computed returns using

the same methodology.

29

Another potential concern is that our ndings of a long-run return reversal for high

F SE

stocks

may be dependent on a large-scale government bailout of Chinese nancial markets that began in
early July. Specically, we will present evidence of a strong long-run reversal of high

F SE

stocks

relative to low-F SE stocks. This pattern might be driven by the possibility that Chinese regulators knew of the details of the brokerage and shadow margin systems and therefore targeted the
bailout at high

F SE

stocks. However, this conjecture contradicts most post-bailout narratives of

the government response to the crisis, which characterize the government as being severely underinformed about the details of the shadow-nanced margin system and lacking a coherent trading
strategy (Bian et al. (2018a), Bian et al. (2018b)).

Moreover, using stock-day-level government

net purchasing data in July 2015, we can calculate the correlation between

F SE

and government

purchases at various lags. We nd that the correlation between government purchases and individual stock

F SE

is close to zero, and sometimes even negative.

This evidence shows that, while

the bailout may have helped stem the aggregate decline in the market, the government did not
disproportionately purchase stocks with high re sale exposure. Therefore, the government bailout
cannot explain the cross-sectional evidence of a long-run return reversal of high
to low

4.3.1 Double Sorts

at the start of each day

For each quartile of previous period returns, we construct

a long-short strategy that longs the bin with the highest

F SE

and shorts the bin with the lowest

F SE .
In Figure 8, we plot the cumulative returns for this long-short strategy in event time, averaged
across all calendar trading days

For all four quartiles of past 10-day returns, we nd a distinct

4.3.2 Regression Analysis
To better account for other factors that could lead to dierential return patterns for high and low

stocks, we turn to regression analysis. We estimate the following regression:

CARi,t+h = γh · F SEit + controlsit + si + τt + εit ,

4.3.3 Regulatory Announcement Event Study
To better identify a causal eect of re sales, we conduct an event study examining how the relation
between

F SE

and stock returns changes after a regulatory tightening announcement. This event

study helps address the concern that an omitted factor, such as bad fundamentals, may spuriously
drive the negative relation between high

F SE

and returns.

Recall that on June 12 (after hours

on a Friday), the CSRC released draft rules that would ban new shadow-nanced margin accounts.
As shown earlier in Section 4.1.4, the regulatory announcement led to a sharp increase in selling
intensity, especially by highly-leveraged shadow accounts. The regulatory tightening announcement

Brokerage- vs. Shadow-Financed Margin Accounts

As explained in Section 2, two types of leveraged margin accounts were active during the Chinese
stock market crash of 2015. In short, brokerage-nanced margin accounts were managed by certied
brokerage rms, and were heavily regulated with lower maximum allowable leverage (lower Pingcang
Lines) and lower leverage on average. Meanwhile, shadow-nanced margin accounts that conducted
trading and borrowing on web-based platforms were free from regulation, and had much higher
Pingcang Lines and leverage.
Since the onset of the stock market crash in early June 2015, practitioners, the media, and regulators have alleged that shadow-nanced margin accounts were the driving force behind the market
collapse.

However, this accusation has largely been untested using concrete evidence.

shadow accounts were more to blame than brokerage accounts is also not obvious.

Whether

As we will

discuss in Section 4.4.2, many estimates suggest that total market assets held within the regulated brokerage-nanced system greatly exceeded that in the unregulated shadow-nanced system.
Furthermore, because brokerage accounts have a lower (and uniformly imposed) Pingcang Line, brokerage accounts may have been closer to their Pingcang Lines (and closer to leverage constraints),
despite their lower average levels of leverage.
However, we show in Panel A of Table 1 that, in addition to having low absolute levels of
leverage, brokerage margin accounts also maintained lower leverage as a fraction of the Pingcang
Lines. Equivalently, shadow margin accounts have lower Distance-to-Margin-Calls, implying that
shadow accounts are more likely to become re sale accounts. With the aid of detailed account-level

32

data, we investigate dierences between shadow and brokerage margin accounts in detail in this
subsection. Our ndings shed light on the consequences of regulation (or lack thereof ).

4.4.1 Selling Intensities for Brokerage and Shadow Accounts
In Section 4.1.1, we showed that accounts tend to sell more of their stock holdings when they are
closer to their account-specic Pingcang Lines, and we classied re sale accounts as those with
DMC below the cuto of 3 (i.e.,

Zjt ≤ 3

as in Eq. (4)). We now repeat the exercise separately

for the brokerage- and shadow-nance margin account samples. The estimated selling intensities
(λk 's) for each account type are plotted in Figure 9 and the corresponding regression coecients
are presented in Table 2, Columns 2 and 3. We nd that the estimated selling intensities decrease
as DMC increases for both samples, consistent with the leverage-induced re sales mechanism.
There are several features in Figure 9 worth discussing. First, for re sale accounts with DMC
below 3 but above zero, selling intensities conditional on a DMC bin are comparable across the
two types of accounts, with slightly larger magnitudes for the shadow margin sample. The similarity in selling intensities within a DMC bin lends support to our DMC measure in Eq. (3) as a
comprehensive measure of account-level risk capturing leverage-induced re sales. We also observe
that the selling intensity of brokerage accounts relative to shadow accounts rises dramatically once
the accounts have reverted to creditor control (Z

< 0).

Although our data does not allow us to

investigate this issue fully, one plausible explanation is that some creditors of shadow accounts may
be wealthy individual investors who exercise discretionary selling once they gain control of defaulted
shadow accounts. In contrast, lenders of brokerage accounts are brokerage rms who may have more
stringent automated risk management systems.

4.4.2 Contribution of Brokerage and Shadow Accounts to Fire Sales
As discussed in Section 2, brokerage-nanced margin accounts dominate their shadow peers in terms
of asset size.

This point is vividly shown in Figure 10, which plots the asset holdings over time

for each account type. The relative asset sizes of the two account types shown in Panel A roughly
reect their relative asset holdings in the entire market.

37

37

We estimate the total asset holdings of all brokerage-nanced margin accounts during the peak of our sample

period to be approximately RMB 8.76 trillion; this is the product of the total debt of brokerage accounts (2.26 trillion
published on stock exchanges) and the asset-to-debt ratio in brokerage account sample of about 3.87 in the week of
June 8-12, 2015. We estimate the total asset holdings of all shadow-nanced margin accounts during the peak of our
sample period to be approximately RMB 1.93 trillion, which is the product of the estimated total debt of shadow
accounts in Section 2.3 (about 1.2 trillion in its peak time) and the asset-to-debt ratio in the shadow account sample

However, Panel A in Figure 10 oers a misleading picture of how these two types of accounts

and farther from their Pingcang Lines.
accounts, i.e., accounts with

Zjt ≤ 3.

In Panel B, we instead plot total assets held in re sale
These re sale accounts are much more likely to receive

margin calls and to exhibit greater selling intensity, as shown earlier in Figure 4.
Once we focus on the asset holdings of re sale accounts in Panel B, we see a quite dierent
picture.

In general, shadow accounts have more total assets held in re sale accounts than do

brokerage accounts.

Before the week of June 24, 2015, the stock holdings in shadow re sale

accounts exceed assets in brokerage re sale accounts by more than 10 to 1.

It is not until the

week of July 1, 2015, when the SSE index had dropped by about 30% from its peak, that the asset
holdings of brokerage re sale accounts increased to be approximately on par with those of shadow
re sale accounts.
Next, we show that shadow accounts matter more for re sales and reversals, i.e., the U-shaped

we also present results with standardized coecients in Appendix Table B.6. We nd that a one

dip in returns than a one standard deviation change in

Overall, the dierences in magnitudes support the view that shadow trading played a relatively
more important role in driving re sales during the Chinese stock market crash in the summer of
2015.

Discussion, Extensions, and Robustness

In this section, we rst discuss how shadow-nanced margin system and re sales played a role in
the 2015 Chinese stock market crash. We then explore the interaction between leverage-induced re
of about 1.61 in the week of June 8-12, 2015. These two numbers imply that the asset holdings of shadow accounts
are approximately 22% that of brokerage accounts. In our sample, this ratio is about 19%.

sales and regulated price limits, which is an interesting institutional feature of the Chinese stock
market.

Finally, we show that our ndings are robust to alternative weighting schemes, cutos,

sample splits, and imputation procedures.

5.1

Discussion: The Role of the Shadow-Financed Margin System and Fire
Sales

We have demonstrated that shadow-nanced margin accounts contributed more than brokerage
accounts to the Chinese stock market crash in 2015. Panel B of Figure 10 suggests the following
narrative for the evolution of the market crash. In the rst half of 2015, shadow accounts maintained
higher absolute leverage and higher leverage relative their Pingcang Lines. However, the potential
selling pressure from these re sale shadow accounts were absorbed by the continuous inow of retail
investors who opened new shadow accounts: in our data, the net inow of funding from shadow

38

accounts peaked at 8.7 trillion Yuan during the week of June 1, 2015.

The news about potential

regulatory tightening for shadow-nancing released on June 12, 2015 not only halted the inow of
new investors (the net inow of funding dropped to 4.6 trillion Yuan) but also increased the selling
by existing shadow accounts, causing the stock market index to fall. The market decline after June
17 triggered a leverage spiral, turning more and more shadow accounts into re sale accounts (as
shown in Panel B of Figure 10), whose selling further depressed stock prices.

The beaten stock

prices in late June 2015 pushed the leverage of brokerage-nanced margin accounts closer to their
Pingcang Lines. As shown in Panel B of Figure 10, brokerage re sale account assets rose sharply
around July 1, and their re sales contributed to the continued market collapse in early July 2015.
The leverage-induced re sale spiral nally stemmed around July 6th, when the Chinese government
started to intervene using large-scale market purchases.
By presenting a battery of empirical evidence, including analysis of account-level selling behavior, reactions to regulatory shocks, and the reversal of high-F SE stocks, this paper shows the
existence of re sales during the 2015 Chinese market crash. However, we emphasize that our evidence, which is primarily cross-sectional in nature coupled with event studies around regulatory
tightening announcements, does not imply that re sales caused the entire Chinese market crash in
2015. The existing literature suggests that the Chinese stock market was overvalued in mid-2015
due to unleashed margin credit starting in 2010 (Hansman et al., 2018). Presumably, the market in-

The net inow of funding is calculated as the asset holdings of newly opened shadow accounts minus the asset

holdings of closed shadow accounts over a given period.

35

dex would have reverted to its fundamental level even without leverage-induced re sales. Leverage
likely shortened the correction phase, causing a rapid crash in the days immediately following a
regulatory announcement aimed at curbing shadow-nanced margin trading. Our ndings parallel
the common narratives concerning the US 1929 stock market crash (Schwert, 1989). While deleveraging is unlikely to be the ultimate cause of the large and persistent drop in the value of the US
stock market in the years following 1929, many scholars believe that deleveraging contributed to
the correction taking the form of dramatic and destabilizing single-day crashes.

5.2

Price Limits and Selling Intensity

During our sample period of May to July 2015, each individual stock was allowed to move a daily
maximum of 10 percent from the previous closing level in either direction, before triggering a price
limit, as explained in Section 2.4. These price limits were introduced with the goal of suppressing
excessive trading and controlling market volatility.

However, the price limits may have had the

unintended consequence of exacerbating re sales crashes in other stocks.

As shown in Table 2,

margin investors are signicantly more likely to sell assets when their account-level leverage nears
their Pingcang Line limits.

We hypothesize that an investor seeking to deleverage may further

intensify the selling of a particular stock if other stocks in her portfolio cannot be sold due to
stock-specic price limits.
For each account-day, we dene price limit fraction as the fractional value of account
as of the start of day

t

j 's assets

that consist of stocks that hit price limits at some later point on day

t.

Price limit fraction measures the extent to which margin investors are constrained in their ability
to sell a subset of their holdings. We then regress net selling at the account-stock-day level on the
set of DMC bins dened earlier, the price limit fraction, and the interaction between the price limit
fraction and the DMC bins. We restrict the regression sample to stocks that do not face trading
suspensions or price limits on day t. The results for the full sample of brokerage and shadow margin
accounts are reported in Table 9 Column 1. As expected, we nd that accounts with lower DMC
are signicantly more likely to sell.

Moreover, the interaction between DMC and price limit is

signicant and positive for all DMC bins, with greater magnitudes for lower bins corresponding to
lower DMC. This is consistent with investors being more likely to sell any particular stock in their
portfolio if other holdings cannot be sold due to government-regulated price limits, with the eect
being larger for investors with stronger deleveraging motives (i.e., those with lower DMC).
We also structured the analysis to account for a key alternative explanation. Accounts with a

price limits.

set of DMC bins. As in the previous regressions examining net selling, we also control for stock-day
and account xed eects. Thus, our estimated eects cannot be explained by high selling due to
poor portfolio returns or by mechanisms that vary only at the stock-day or account level. Instead,
we nd that deleveraging motives combined with price limits intensify the selling pressure for stocks
that are not yet protected by price limits.

5.3

Other Robustness Checks

Appendix Table B.4 shows that the results in Table 7 are robust to the choice of

Zjt ≤ 3

as the

cuto for margin accounts to be classied as re sale accounts. Instead of calculating each stock's
re sale exposure as the fraction of shares held by re sale accounts, we estimate re sale exposure
as the fraction of shares held in any margin account, with each account's holdings weighted by the
corresponding selling intensities
We nd that this alternative

λk

λk -weighted

measure of re sale exposure predicts a similar U-shaped

return pattern. As another robustness check, we adopt a conservative treatment that only classies
account-date observations with

Z < 0 (these accounts have been taken over by creditors) as re sale

accounts; this amounts to setting

λZ<0 = 1

while all other

λk = 0.

The results are qualitatively

similar, as shown in Appendix Table B.5.
Appendix Table B.6 presents standardized coecients, as discussed earlier in Section 4.4, which
allow for comparison of magnitudes across the brokerage and shadow samples. Finally, Appendix
Table B.7 shows that our results are unlikely to be driven by the imputation of stock returns.
Some stocks in our sample experienced trading suspensions for one or more trading days. In our
baseline analysis, we impute the returns for days in which trading was suspended using the most
recent traded prices before and after the suspension. In this robustness test, we exclude stock-day
observations from the regression sample if the stock ever experiences a full day of suspended trading
during the event period

[t, t + 40],

and nd a similar U-shaped pattern in returns.

Conclusion

Using unique account-level data for brokerage-nanced and shadow-nanced margin traders in the
Chinese stock market, we study the role of deleveraging and re sales in the Chinese stock market
crash in the summer of 2015, during which the SSE index fell by more than 30%.

As direct

evidence for leverage-induced re sales, we show that margin investors heavily sell their holdings
when their account-level leverage edges toward their maximum leverage limits (the Pingcang Line),
controlling for stock-date and account xed eects.

This selling pressure leads stocks that are

disproportionately held by investors who are close to receiving margin calls to be exposed to re
sale risk, especially during periods when the market is in rapid decline. Consistent with this view,
we show that stocks with greater re sale risk exposure experience larger abnormal price declines
and subsequent reversals, relative to stocks with lower re sale risk.
We would like to highlight that the leveraged-induced 2015 Chinese stock market crash studied
in this paper closely resembles the US stock market crash of 1929. According to Galbraith (2009),
margin trading thrived in the period leading up to the 1929 crash, with outstanding margin credit
rising from about 1 billion dollars in the beginning of 1920s to 17 billion dollars in the summer of
1929. Moreover, the US margin trading system in 1929 was very similar to China's shadow-nanced
margin system in 2015, in that both systems lacked market-wide regulations of initial margins and
minimum margins (these regulations were later introduced by the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934 in the US). In response to the regulatory void, individual traders took on excessive leverage
both in the US in 1929 and in China in 2015, leading to re sale externalities (e.g., Lorenzoni (2008),
Stein (2012), He and Kondor (2016), and Davila and Korinek (2017)). This view is consistent with
another major nding of this paper: although regulated brokerage-nanced margin accounts held a
much larger fraction of market assets, unregulated shadow-nanced margin accounts played a more
signicant role in the 2015 Chinese market crash.

Leverage in Brokerage and Shadow Margin Accounts
Panel A depicts the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) composite index (the dashed blue line), the average
leverage for shadow margin accounts (the solid red line), and the average leverage for brokerage margin
accounts (the dashed-dotted red line), weighted by the equity size of each account, at the start of each day
from May to July, 2015. To compute the average, we weight each account's leverage by the equity in each
account. Weighted in this manner, average leverage equals total debt scaled by total equity. Panel B presents

of standard deviations of downward movements in asset values necessary for the current level of leverage to
meet the Pingcang Line; when Z drops below zero, the investor loses control of the account to the creditor
because account level leverage has exceeded the account's Pingcang Line. We plot the 15th (solid red line),
20th (dashed-dotted red line), 50th (dashed red line), and 80th (dotted red line) percentiles of the full sample
including both brokerage- and shadow-nanced margin accounts, at the start of each day from May to July,
2015.

Distance-to-Margin-Call and Investor Selling Intensity
This gure plots the coecients λk from the regression:

j
λk Ik,t−1
+ νit + αj + εjit ,

k=1
j
where δjt
is account j 's net selling volume of stock i on day t, normalized by account j 's initial holding of
j
stock i at the beginning of day t. νit is the stock-date xed eect and αj is the account xed eect. Ik,t−1
represents 10 bins for each account's Distance-to-Margin-Call, with higher bins corresponding to accounts
that are closer to their leverage limit (the Pingcang Line). Accounts with leverage exceeding the Pingcang
Line are assigned to bin 11. Unleveraged accounts are the omitted category. The sample includes all
brokerage- and shadow-nanced margin accounts, as well as brokerage non-margin accounts which aid in the
estimation of the omitted category. The sample is restricted to stock-days in which a stock is not suspended
from trading at any point during day t, and is also restricted to stocks i held by account j as of the start of
day t. The time period is from May to July, 2015.

Distance-to-Margin-Call and Investor Selling Intensity: Market Returns
This gure plots the coecients λk from the regression dened in Figure 4, estimated separately for the
samples in which the market return on day t is positive and negative.

Figure 6

Regulatory Tightening
Regulatory tightening announcements occurred after hours on Friday May 22, 2015 and Friday June 12, 2015.
This gure plots the coecients λk from the regression dened in Figure 4, separately for the brokerage and
shadow samples for the ve trading days immediately before and after the announcements events. There are
very few brokerage observations corresponding to the far right bins representing DMC close to zero if the
left two panel; the λk 's for those bins are insignicantly dierent from zero.

Figure 7

Net Selling by Fire Sale Accounts
This gure plots net selling of high re sale exposure stocks by re sale accounts as a percentage of total
volume traded. To compute the series, we rst restrict the sample to stocks in the top decile of re sale
exposure, calculated as of the start of each trading day. For each stock-day, we compute total net selling by
re sale accounts as a percentage of total trading volume for the same set of stocks on that day (in monetary
units), and aggregate at the weekly level.

Figure 8

Returns Following Fire Sales: Long-Short Portfolio
This gure plots the average long-short portfolio cumulative abnormal return after double sorts based on
each stock's previous period return and re sale exposure (FSE). On each day t, we sort all stocks held by
re sale accounts into four quartiles according to their return over the period [t − 10, t − 1]. Within each
quartile, we then sort stocks into 10 bins according to their FSE at the start of each day t. For each quartile
of previous period returns, we construct a long-short strategy that longs the bin with the highest FSE and
shorts the bin with the lowest FSE. The sample includes all stocks held by brokerage- and shadow-nanced
margin accounts. The time period is from May to July, 2015. The dotted lines represent 90% condence
intervals. Standard errors and condence bands are estimated from a stock by event-day level regression
using a sample restricted to the top and bottom deciles in terms of FSE at the start of day t and for the
relevant return quartile over the period [t − 10, t − 1]. We regress cumulative returns on indicators for event
dates t, t+1, ... , t+40 as well as the interaction between the event date indicators and an indicator for
whether the observation is in the top decile for FSE. The graph plots the coecients on the interaction
terms, which represent the dierence in average cumulative returns between the two decile portfolios for
each event date. Standard errors are allowed to be double-clustered by calendar day and stock. The sample
is restricted to stocks that do not experience suspended trading on day t.

Table 1

Summary Statistics
This table presents summary statistics for account activity and stocks characteristics from May to July
2015. Leverage is the ratio of assets to equity at the start of each account-day, where equity is equal to
assets minus debt. The Pingcang Line is the account-level maximum allowable level of leverage. Z is the
Distance-to-Margin-Call. An account is classied as a re sale account on day t if Z is less than or equal to
3. Net selling is account j 's net selling volume of stock i on day t, normalized by account j 's shares held of
stock i at the beginning of day t. Selling pressure is the total net selling volume of stock i on day t from
all re sale accounts that hold stock i at the start of day t, scaled by the number of outstanding shares of
stock i at the beginning of day t. Fire sale exposure is the ratio of the total shares of stock i held in re sale
accounts at the start of day t to the number of outstanding shares of stock i on day t. CAR is the cumulative
abnormal return estimated relative to the CAPM, with beta calculated for each stock using year 2014 data.
Return volatility is the standard deviation of returns during the prior 60 days. Log market value is the log
of the product of each stock's daily close price and total number of shares outstanding, measured in t − 3.
Avg turnover is the average of the ratio of trading volume in shares to the total shares outstanding in the
prior 60 days.

stock i at the beginning of day t. νit is the stock-date xed eect and αj is the account xed eect. Ik,t−1
represents 10 bins for each account's Distance-to-Margin-Call, with higher bins corresponding to accounts
that are closer to their leverage limit (the Pingcang Line). Accounts with leverage exceeding the Pingcang
Line are assigned to bin 11. Unleveraged accounts are the omitted category. The sample includes brokerageand shadow-nanced margin accounts, as well as brokerage non-margin accounts which comprise the omitted
category. The sample is restricted to stock-days in which a stock is not suspended from trading at any point
during day t, and is also restricted to stocks i held by account j as of the start of day t. The time period
isBaseline
from May to July, 2015. Standard errors are allowed to be clustered at the account-date level. ***, **, *

Table 3

Leverage-to-Pingcang and Leverage Interactions
This table examines how leverage levels and the Leverage-to-Pingcang ratio impact net selling. The sample
is restricted to shadow-nanced margin accounts, for which we can separately identify leverage and Leverageto-Pingcang, due to variation in Pingcang Lines across accounts. Other sample restrictions are the same
as in Table 2. Column 1 replicates Column 3 of Table 2, substituting DMC with ten equally spaced bins
for Leverage-to-Pingcang. Column 2 adds controls for ve bins representing leverage at the start of of each
account-day and the interaction between the leverage bins and an indicator for whether the account has
a Leverage-to-Pingcang below 4. The leverage bins are spaced so that the number of observations in the
Leverage-to-Pingcang bins b and b + 1 are equal to the number of observations in leverage bin b/2, for
b = 2, 4, ..., 10. Standard errors are allowed to be clustered at the account-date level. ***, **, * correspond

Table 9

Price Limits
This table tests whether an investor is more likely to sell a stock if other stocks in her portfolio cannot be
sold due to stock-specic price limits that limit trading if a stock's within-day absolute return exceeds 10%.
Price limit fraction equals the fractional value of account j 's total stock holdings as of the start of day t
that consist of stocks that hit price oors at some later point on day t or experienced suspended trading for
any reason on day t. All specications control for each account's day t counterfactual returns assuming no
stocks are bought or sold on day t, interacted with the set of bins for Distance-to-Margin-Call. All other
variables are as dened in Table 2. The sample is restricted to stocks that do not face trading restrictions
or price limits on day t. The sample includes brokerage- and shadow-nanced margin accounts, as well as
brokerage non-margin accounts which comprise the omitted category. Standard errors are allowed to be
clustered at the stock-date level. ***, **, * correspond to statistical signicance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively.

A

Internet Data Appendix

The shadow-nanced margin account data is organized in a umbrella-style structure.

There are

153,331 child accounts, each of which is connected to a mother accounts maintained by the trading
platform. For each child account, we observe the initial lending ratio of the borrower, dened as
the amount of borrowing divided by the investor's margin deposit (equity). We also observe the

minimum coverage ratio, the ratio of remaining assets to debt, that will trigger a margin call.

A.1

Data Filter

We adopt the following procedure to clean our data.
1. We eliminate accounts with invalid initial margin and maintenance margin information. We
require the initial lending ratio to be less than 100. There are some accounts with extremely
high initial lending ratios.

They are usually used as a bonus to investors with much lower

lending ratios and typically carry very little assets. On the other hand, we require the minimum

coverage ratio to be above 1, i.e, investors will receive the margin calls before outstanding debt
exceeds the current asset wealth. Agent accounts with margin information outside these ranges
might be maintained by non-margin accounts.
2. We require the rst record in the margin accounts to be a cash ow from the mother account,
before the account starts any trading activities. These cash ows usually occur right after the
account opens, and includes the loans from the lenders together with the deposited margins
from the borrowers. We eliminate observations from accounts that either never have any cash
ows from mother accounts, or the rst cash ows are from the child accounts to the mother
accounts.
3. We compare the size of initial cash ows and the initial debt information provided by the
trading platform, and further eliminate observations from accounts for which the size of the
initial cash ow deviates signicantly from the initial debt reported by the online trading
system.

A.2

Construction of daily debt level

The shadow accounts data includes all variables in the brokerage account data, except for the
end-of-day leverage numbers. Instead, the trading platform provides detailed information on the
initial debt, subsequent cash ows between the mother account (controlled by the lender) and child
accounts (controlled by the borrowers), and all trades by the child accounts. We can thus manually
calculate the end-of-day asset and debt value for each child account.
To construct daily outstanding debt for each margin child account in our dataset, we rely on
the cash ow information between the mother and child accounts, as well as transaction remarks,
both provided by the trading platform. For about two-thirds of the accounts, the platform provides
detailed remarks for each cash ow (whether it is an issued loan or loan repayment), which helps us
calculate the exact daily outstanding debt levels. For the remaining accounts without transaction
remarks, we assume that cash ows to (from) the mother account exceeding 20% of the margin debt
in the child account reects a payment of existing debt (additional borrowing). This 20% cuto
rule is suggested by practitioners in the trading platform.

Table B.7

Fire Sales and Reversals, Excluding Imputed Prices
This table presents the same regressions as in Table 7, but exclude stocks that ever experienced a full day
of suspended trading during the event period [t, t + 40]. In our baseline analysis, we impute stock prices
and returns for trading days in which a particularly stock did not trade. The imputation procedure uses
information on the most recent traded prices before and after the trading suspension. Standard errors are
allowed
be clustered at the date level. ***, **, * correspond to statistical signicance at the 1%, 5%, and
Full, noto
imputation
10% levels, respectively.
