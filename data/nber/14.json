Here we seek to compare the earnings patterns of people attending different types of colleges.  The classification of colleges used in this study is the scheme developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education based on the sense of commitments to research, types of programs offered and selectivity of admission of students.  We find that at the college level, differences in type of  institution attended have highly significant effects on differences in lifetime earning patterns of students.\n\n",
