    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a text-based method for measuring and analyzing the international propagation of uncertainty shocks at the \ufb01rm level. We apply this method to estimate the impact of Brexit-related uncertainty and \ufb01nd widespread reverberations on listed \ufb01rms in 81 countries. International \ufb01rms most exposed to Brexit uncertainty not only signi\ufb01cantly lost market value but also reduced hiring and investments. In addition to Brexit uncertainty (the second moment), we \ufb01nd that international \ufb01rms overwhelmingly expected negative direct e\ufb00ects from Brexit (the \ufb01rst moment). Most prominently, \ufb01rms expected di\ufb03culties from regulatory divergence, reduced labor mobility, and limited trade access.\n\n",
