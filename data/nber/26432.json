    "abstract": "\n\nThe \u2018China shock\u2019 operated in part through the housing market, which is one reason why its impact was so large in the United States. We add housing to a multi-region monopolistic competition model, with individuals choosing whether and where to work. Controlling for housing reduces the negative coefficient of import exposure on manufacturing employment by 20-25%, with a significant indirect magnification through the housing market. Combining manufacturing and construction employment, the indirect effect of the China shock through the housing market explains one-fifth as much of the variance in employment as the direct effect of import exposure, with further employment impacts through independent fluctuations in the housing market.\n\n",
