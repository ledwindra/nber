Granular Comparative Advantage

JEL No. D20,D43,F10,F40
ABSTRACT
Large firms play a pivotal role in international trade, shaping the export patterns of countries. We
propose and quantify a granular multi-sector model of trade, which combines fundamental
comparative advantage across sectors with granular comparative advantage embodied in
outstanding individual firms. We develop an SMM-based estimation procedure, which takes full
account of the general equilibrium of the model, to jointly estimate these fundamental and
granular forces using French micro-data with information on firm domestic and export sales
across manufacturing industries. We find that granularity accounts for about 20% of the variation
in realized export intensity across sectors, and is more pronounced in the most export-intensive
sectors. In turn, idiosyncratic firm dynamics accounts for a large share of the evolution of a
country's comparative advantage over time. Governments face strong incentives to target trade
policy at large individual foreign exporters, and to use lenient antitrust regulation at home to
substitute for beggar-thy-neighbor trade policy.

Introduction

Firms play a pivotal role in international trade. A significant share of exports is done by a
small number of large firms, which enjoy substantial market power across destination countries.1 The fates of these large firms shape, in part, the countries’ trade patterns. For instance,
Nokia in Finland or the Intel plant in Costa Rica have profoundly altered the specialization and
export intensity of these countries.2 The importance of large firms is also reflected in trade
and industrial policies that are often so narrow that they appear tailor-made to target individual firms rather than industries. In particular, antitrust regulation, antidumping policies, and
international sanctions all target large individual foreign firms.3
In this paper, we study the role of individual firms in determining the comparative advantage of a country. We decompose comparative advantage into two components: First, an inherent country-sector characteristic, which can stem from technological or endowment differences, and is, importantly, immune to the fate of individual firms. We call it fundamental comparative advantage. Second, specific expertise embodied in individual firms and entrepreneurs,
which determines what we call granular comparative advantage. We set out to measure the
contribution of granular comparative advantage to international trade flows. We then study
the extent to which the granular origin of sectors shapes the evolution of their export performance over time. Finally, we analyze trade and antitrust policies targeted at granular sectors.
We thus revisit the fundamental questions in international trade: what goods do countries
trade and what is the source of a country’s comparative advantage? We find that granularity
accounts for about 20% of the variation in realized export intensity across sectors, which suggests that a substantial share of international trade flows is intrinsically linked to the success
of individual firms. Second, we show that idiosyncratic firm dynamics can account for the
bulk of the evolution of a country’s comparative advantage over time, contributing in an important way to the inter-sectoral reallocation of employment and production. Finally, we find
that governments have an incentive to target trade policy at large individual foreign exporters,

In their “Export superstars” paper, Freund and Pierola (2015) find that a single largest exporting firm accounts
for 17% of total manufacturing exports, on average across 32 developing and middle-income countries in their
dataset. In the French manufacturing dataset used in this paper, the largest firm accounts for 7% of all manufacturing exports, and within 4-digit industries the largest firm accounts on average for 28% of the industry exports.

In Costa Rica, Intel decided to close its microchip plant and move it to Asia in 2014. The electronics sector
represented a steady 27% of Costa-Rican exports until 2013, yet starting 2015 it fell to just 8%. In Finland, Nokia
at its peak in the mid-2000s enjoyed a 25% share of total Finnish exports, a 3.7% share of Finnish GDP, and a
39% share of the global mobile phone market, before collapsing following the smartphone revolution launched
by Apple, and being eventually bought-out by Microsoft in 2013.

Recent examples of international antitrust regulations are the 2007 case of the European Commission (EC)
against Microsoft Corporation and the 2017 fine imposed by the EC on Google. A very recent case of a granular
trade war is the 292% tariff imposed by the US on a particular jet produced by the Canadian Bombardier. “Granular” tactics are particularly widespread in antidumping retaliation (see Blonigen and Prusa 2008) and international
sanctions (as in the recent case of the US against the Chinese ZTE).

rather than entire industries. In addition, in granular sectors, they can use lenient antitrust
policy as a substitute for beggar-thy-neighbor trade policy.
The international trade literature has shifted towards modeling individual firm exporting
decisions, with a focus on firm heterogeneity and selection of the fittest firms into exporting.
At the same time, the workhorse model maintains the assumption that sectors are comprised
of a continuum of firms, each firm being infinitesimal. Under this continuum assumption,
the productivity of any individual firm is inconsequential for sectoral trade patterns. Indeed,
such continuous models are equivalent in the aggregate to a neoclassical Ricardian model that
focuses on sector-level technologies and fully abstracts from modeling individual firms.
We propose and quantify an alternative multi-sector granular model of trade. We lift the
assumption of a continuum of firms, acknowledging that a finite number of firms operate in
each sector, with the largest firms often claiming a large share of the market. In our model,
firms are small at the level of the whole economy, yet they are big within their individual
industries. Under these circumstances, realized sectoral productivities, and hence the comparative advantage of a country, are shaped in part by the idiosyncrartic productivity draws
of individual firms, which do not average out at the sectoral level.
Our granular model builds on a number of familiar ingredients. Across sectors, it features classic Ricardian forces as in Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977; henceforth DFS).
Within sectors, we maintain the firm heterogeneity assumption of the Melitz (2003) model,
but relax the assumption of a continuum of firms, following Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012;
henceforth EKS). Specifically, we assume that a finite number of firms in each sector draw productivities from a Pareto distribution, resulting in a distribution of sectoral firm sales which approximates Zipf’s law, as observed in the data.4 Our model is a multi-sector extension of EKS,
which allows us to simultaneously nest fundamental and granular comparative advantage in
a unified framework. We set up the model and study its analytical properties in Section 2.
In Section 3, we develop a simulated method of moments (SMM) estimation procedure
which takes full account of the general equilibrium of our granular model. We estimate the
model using firm-level data on domestic and export sales of French firms across 119 4-digit
manufacturing industries. To disentangle the relative roles of fundamental and granular forces,
we leverage information on the cross-sectional joint distribution of sectoral trade flows and
domestic sales concentration within sectors. Intuitively, sectors in which export intensity is
high due to granular comparative advantage are expected to feature outlying firms that are
particularly large relative to other firms in the industry. We show that the estimated granular model, which features limited heterogeneity in parameters across sectors, is successful at

Zipf’s law is a fat-tailed Pareto distribution with a shape parameter of 1. The law of large numbers provides
a particularly poor approximation when a large number of draws are taken from a fat-tailed distribution.

reproducing the rich empirical cross-sectoral distributions — such as those of the number of
firms, of market shares of the largest firm, and of sectoral export intensity.
We use the estimated model in Section 4 to quantify the importance of granularity in shaping sectoral trade outcomes. In the model, as in the data, despite the fact that an average manufacturing sector features around 350 firms, the largest home firm accounts on average for 20%
of the domestic-market sales by all home firms. This is a reflection of a fat-tailed distribution
of firm sales, and hence of strong granular forces. We find that not only is a substantial share of
trade flows of granular origin, but the contribution of granularity is particularly pronounced
in the most export-intensive sectors, i.e. in the export champions of the country. Among the
top 10% export-intensive sectors, nearly one third of exports is of granular origin. In addition,
we show that conventional inference of fundamental sectoral productivities based on sectoral
export shares leads to biased estimates in a granular world. Measurable proxies of granularity,
such as the relative sales share of the top firm in the domestic market, predict trade flows and
can be used to reduce this bias. We also develop a Bayesian filtering technique to predict the
likelihood that exports in a given sector in the data are of granular origin.
Having established the role of granularity to shaping the sectoral trade patterns, we explore in Section 5 its dynamic implications. First, we study the role of granularity in explaining
the evolution of comparative advantage over time. To this end, we extend our granular model
to allow for industry dynamics driven by idiosyncratic firm productivity shocks, disciplined
with the persistence of firm market shares in the data. We find that the model is simultaneously consistent with the hyper-specialization of countries in a few industries at any given
point in time and with a relatively fast mean reversion in comparative advantage, emphasized
in a recent paper by Hanson, Lind, and Muendler (2016; henceforth HLM). In particular, our
granular model with firm-level productivity dynamics, but no dynamics in fundamental comparative advantage, can already account for over 60% of the mean reversion in comparative
advantage documented in HLM for a panel of countries, and accounts for close to all of the
mean reversion we observe in our French manufacturing dataset.5 We illustrate further the
dynamic implications of granularity for trade patterns by showing how the exit of a large firm
can radically alter the export stance of a sector. In certain cases, sectors switch from being
among the most export-intensive to becoming comparatively disadvantaged, as a disproportionate share of sales of the exiting granular firm is re-captured by foreign firms.
Finally, Section 6 studies some of the policy implications of granular comparative advantage. Some important dimensions of industrial and trade policy concern large individual firms,
such as antitrust policy or trade policy targeted at individual firms or products. We use our

Together with mean reversion in comparative advantage, firm dynamics in a granular open economy causes
production and employment reallocation across sectors, which accounts for about 20% of total labor reallocation
across firms, consistent with the empirical patterns documented in the macro-labor literature.

model to study the general equilibrium welfare and distributional implications of these policies in a granular open economy. First, we study the merger of two large domestic firms. The
increase in monopoly power and the resulting destruction of consumer surplus make mergers undesirable in a closed economy. However, in an open economy, mergers can be welfare
improving for the home country, as the merged home firm is able to capture a larger portion
of the foreign consumer surplus. Thus, open economies might be excessively lenient towards
mergers, especially in granular sectors, using them to manipulate the terms of trade.
Second, we study the incentives of a country to impose an import tariff on a single large
foreign exporter. We find that in a granular world, a country prefers a tariff on the largest
firm over a uniform tariff on all sectoral imports, particularly so in sectors where its trade
partner enjoys a granular comparative advantage. The reason is that by taxing the largest
foreign firm, a country takes advantage not only of the general-equilibrium terms-of-trade
effect, operating via a reduction in the foreign wage rate, but also of the industry-level termsof-trade improvement, due to a markup reduction by the large foreign firm.
Related literature The term “granularity” has been coined in the macroeconomics literature, which following Gabaix (2011) has focused on the study of aggregate fluctuations driven
by idiosyncratic productivity shocks (see e.g. Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, and TahbazSalehi 2012, Carvalho and Gabaix 2013, Carvalho and Grassi 2014). The aggregate volatility consequences of granularity in an open economy have been studied by di Giovanni and
Levchenko (2012) and di Giovanni, Levchenko, and Méjean (2014). Instead of aggregate volatility, we focus here on sectoral trade patterns, where the granular forces must be at least as
prominent, since granularity is particularly pronounced within sectors.
In terms of modeling, we borrow from the recent trade literature, and in particular from EKS.
EKS tackle a very different set of issues in the context of a single-sector model, such as explaining the prevalence of zeros in aggregate trade flows, while we develop a multi-sector environment to explore the implications of granularity for a country’s comparative advantage.6 In
terms of the question studied, our paper therefore contributes to the empirical trade literature
on the structure and evolution of comparative advantage, e.g. Chor (2010), Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer (2012), Freund and Pierola (2015), Sutton and Trefler (2016), Levchenko and
Zhang (2016), and HLM.
For our analysis, we adopt a model of oligopolistic competition with variable markups,
which has been used in a number of papers studying the behavior of markups, prices and
market shares in an open economy (see e.g. Atkeson and Burstein 2008, Edmond, Midrigan,
and Xu 2015, Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings 2014, 2018, Hottman, Redding, and Weinstein 2015).

In the context of import sourcing, Head, Jing, and Ries (2017) study the role of granularity of buyers in
explaining hierarchy violations.

We follow Neary (2003, 2012, 2015) and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2010) in studying an
open economy oligopolistic environment with firms that are big in the small (at the sectoral
level), but small in the big (at the economy-wide level). More generally, see Bernard, Jensen,
Redding, and Schott (2018) for a recent review of the empirical and theoretical literature on
the role of individual firms in international trade.
On the policy front, our study is related to the vast literature on trade policy and market structure, summarized in Helpman and Krugman (1989) and Bagwell and Staiger (2004).7
We contribute to this literature by studying policy implications in a quantitative model of
oligopolistic competition with many firms, which captures the salient features of the market
structure of modern manufacturing industries.

A Granular Model of Comparative Advantage

This section sets up our granular model and discusses its properties. The model is a twocountry multi-sector model, which combines a Ricardian DFS model across sectors with the
EKS model of granular firms within each sector.8 The model nests as special cases both the
DFS-Melitz model, as firms become infinitesimal, as well as the Ricardian DFS model, as varieties of products become perfect substitutes and fixed costs tend to zero (see Appendix B.1).
Preferences There is a unit continuum of sectors z ∈ [0, 1]. Households in each country
have the same Cobb-Douglas preferences over the consumption of sectoral output {Qz }:

where {αz }z∈[0,1] are non-negative preference parameters, which satisfy 0 αz dz = 1, and
determine the shares of household income spent on consumption across sectors.
Within each sector, there is a finite number of product varieties i ∈ {1, .., Kz }, which are
combined into aggregate sectoral output using a CES aggregator:

where σ > 1 is the within-sector elasticity of substitution, common across all sectors. The Kz

foreign origin. In the foreign market, there are Kz∗ product varieties available for consumption,

The early classics include Dixit (1984), Brander and Spencer (1984), Eaton and Grossman (1986); the examples
of more recent work are Horn and Levinsohn (2001) and Costinot, Rodríguez-Clare, and Werning (2016).

which are in general different from the set of varieties marketed at home. In what follows,
starred variables correspond to the foreign market.
With this demand structure, the home consumer expenditure on variety i in sector z is:

with

(3)

where pz,i is the price and sz,i is the within-sector market share of the product variety, and
Y is aggregate income (expenditure) in the home market. The expressions in (3) derive from
the fact that with Cobb-Douglas preferences, consumers spend a constant share αz of their
income Y on purchasing varieties in sector z (i.e., Pz Qz = αz Y ), and within sector z the CES

demand for variety i is given by qz,i = pz,i /Pz
Qz . The sectoral price index Pz satisfies:

The home and foreign households respectively supply L and L∗ units of labor inelastically,
with L/L∗ measuring the relative size of the home country.
Production technology Each product variety is supplied by an individual firm with productivity ϕz,i (ϕ∗z,i , respectively, if the firm is foreign). Products are produced in their market of origin, and firms have access to a CRS production technology, which uses local labor,
yz,i = ϕz,i `z,i . The output of the firm can be marketed domestically and exported. Exporting
is associated with an iceberg trade cost τ ≥ 1, that is τ units of product need to be shipped for
one unit to arrive at the foreign market. Therefore, the marginal cost of supplying the home
market is constant and equal to:
(
cz,i =

w/ϕz,i , if i is a home variety,
τ w∗ /ϕ∗z,i , if i is a foreign variety,

(5)

where w and w∗ are respectively the home and foreign wage rates. The marginal cost of
serving the foreign market is defined symmetrically, and we denote it with c∗z,i .
Furthermore, there is a fixed market access cost F in local units of labor, which is independent of the origin of the firm, i.e. applies both for local firms and exporters. As a result, the
differential selection of domestic and foreign firms into the local market is driven by iceberg
trade costs, rather than by a differential fixed access cost. In each market, we sort all potential
entrants in the increasing order of marginal cost cz,i (c∗z,i in foreign, respectively). The index i
refers to the marginal cost ranking of a firm in a given market, so that the same firm is in
general represented by different indexes in different markets.
6

Productivity draws We denote with Mz a potential (shadow) number of domestic products in sector z. Mz is the realization of a Poisson random variable with parameter M̄z , so that
E(Mz ) = M̄z . Each of the Mz potential entrants takes an iid productivity draw from a Pareto
distribution with a shape parameter θ and lower bound ϕz .9 We borrow this structure of productivity draws from the earlier work of Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003) and EKS.
It results both in a tractable model environment and in a realistic cross-sectional distribution
of firm revenues.
Given this productivity structure, the combined parameter:
Tz ≡ M̄z · ϕθz

(6)

is a sufficient statistic that determines the expected productivity of a sector.10 Intuitively, a
sector is more productive either if there are more potential entrants (i.e., productivity draws),
equal to M̄z in expectation, or if the average productivity of a potential entrant is high, which
θ
ϕz .
is given by θ−1
The pool of foreign potential products and the ensuing productivity draws are obtained in
a symmetric way, with country-sector-specific parameters M̄z∗ and ϕ∗z , resulting in a sufficient
statistic for the expected sectoral productivity Tz∗ = M̄z∗ · (ϕ∗z )θ . The ratio Tz /Tz∗ varies across
sectors z and determines the expected relative productivity of the two countries, and thus is
a measure of the home’s fundamental comparative advantage. Tz /Tz∗ is the only source of
comparative advantage in the continuous DFS-Melitz limit of the model (see Appendix B.1).
Market structure For a given set of Kz entrants, the firms play a Bertrand oligopolistic
price setting game, similar to Atkeson and Burstein (2008). Specifically, firm i ∈ {1, .., Kz }
chooses its prices pz,i , taking as given the prices of its competitors {pz,j }j6=i , to maximize its
profits from serving the home market:

where we used the expressions for the market share of the firm (3) and the sectoral price
index (4). While firms are large within their industries, and hence internalize their effect on

Formally, the realized number of products Mz has the pdf P Mz = m = e−M̄z M̄zm /m! for m = 0, 1, 2..,
while the cdf of productivity draws ϕ is given by Gz (ϕ) = 1 − (ϕz /ϕ)θ .
10
In particular, EKS show that the number of productivity draws above any given ϕ > ϕz is a Poisson random
variable with a mean parameter Tz ϕ−θ , increasing in Tz and decreasing in ϕ. As long as the least efficient product
stays inactive in equilibrium, the model is invariant to various combinations of M̄z and ϕz , which result in the
same Tz . A convenient limiting case with M̄z → ∞ and ϕz → 0 (holding Tz constant) ensures that there is
always a sufficient number of draws and the least productive draw is necessarily inactive.

the sectoral price index (4), they are still infinitesimal at the level of the whole economy, since
the model features a continuum of sectors, different from EKS. Therefore, firms take wage
rates w and w∗ as given, and hence treat cz,i as exogenous to their decisions.
The solution to this Bertrand-Nash competition game is a markup price setting rule:
pz,i =

εz,i
· cz,i ,
εz,i − 1

εz,i ≡ ε(sz,i ) = σ(1 − sz,i ) + sz,i ,

where

(7)

with the market share of the firm sz,i defined in (3), and with εz,i ∈ [1, σ] measuring the
effective elasticity of residual demand for the product of the firm. This elasticity decreases,
pz,i
ε
and hence the markup µz,i ≡ cz,i
= εz,iz,i−1 increases, with the market share of the firm sz,i .
This contrasts with the constant-markup pricing under monopolistic competition in the continuous DFS-Melitz limit of the model.11

To summarize, given the set of entrants and their marginal costs {cz,i }K
i=1 , the equilibrium
z
in the Bertrand-Nash price setting game is a vector of prices and market shares {pz,i , sz,i }K

and a sectoral price index Pz , which solve the fixed point defined by (7), (3) and (4). While there
is no analytical characterization of the resulting prices and market shares, the equilibrium is
unique and has the property that prices pz,i increase with marginal costs cz,i , while markups
µz,i = pz,i /cz,i and market shares sz,i decrease with cz,i . Furthermore, the equilibrium firm
profits from serving the home market are given by:

Much of the earlier granularity literature (including Carvalho and Grassi 2014, di Giovanni and Levchenko
2012) adopts an ad hoc assumption of constant markups. The quantitative pricing-to-market literature following
Atkeson and Burstein (2008) studies oligopolistic competition with variable markups, but adopts competition
in quantities, which is qualitatively similar but results in greater markup variability (see discussion in Amiti,
Itskhoki, and Konings 2018). We adopt a more natural case of oligopolistic competition in prices, following EKS,
which results in a less pronounced quantitative difference from the constant markup case.

be negative. With a discrete number of potential entrants, there may exist multiple equilibria
in the entry game. We therefore consider a sequential entry game in each market separately.
Specifically, firms with lower marginal costs of serving a given market, cz,i , move first. We
assign the indexes i such that cz,1 ≤ cz,2 ≤ .., and hence firms with lower indexes i choose
whether to enter first.12 With this equilibrium selection, the entry game has a unique cutoff
equilibrium, so that only firms with marginal costs below some cutoff enter the market.
z
Formally, denote by sK
z,i the market share of firm i ≤ Kz resulting from the price-setting

game when Kz firms choose to enter. The corresponding profits are given by ΠK

defined in (8). We already know that, for a given Kz , sK
z,i is decreasing in i. Furthermore, it

is easy to verify that sK

z,i is decreasing in Kz for all i, that is sz,i < sz,i

since Πz (sK
z,i ) is a monotonically increasing function of sz,i , there exists a unique Kz such that

ΠK
z,i ≥ 0 for all i ≤ Kz and Πz,i < 0 for all i > Kz and K > Kz . This Kz is the equilibrium
number of entrants, and cz,Kz is the cutoff cost level. Note that, due to monotonicity, it is
Kz +1
z
sufficient to find the unqiue Kz such that ΠK
z,Kz ≥ 0 and Πz,Kz +1 < 0.
General equilibrium is a vector of wage rates and incomes (w, w∗ , Y, Y ∗ ), such that labor markets clear in both countries and aggregate incomes equal aggregate expenditures. In
particular, in the home country

and hence trade balance. We normalize w = 1 as numeraire and omit the foreign budget
constraint by Walras’ law.

In turn, given the aggregate equilibrium vector X, the solution to the entry and price-setting
game in each country-sector yields the sectoral equilibrium vector Z. The resulting fixed point
(X, Z) is the equilibrium in the granular economy.
Properties of the granular model In the following sections, we use the granular model
to quantify the role played by individual firms in shaping the comparative advantage of a
country. To set the stage for this analysis, we now discuss the properties of one object of
interest, which summarizes the comparative advantage of a country in a given sector, namely
the foreign share. The sectoral foreign share is the cumulative market share of all foreign firms
serving the home market in a given sector z, and we denote it by:14
XKz
Xz∗
=
(1 − ιz,i )sz,i ,
Λz ≡
i=1
αz Y

(12)

where Xz∗ is total home imports (foreign exports) and αz Y is total home absorption in sector z.
By analogy, the home export share in sector z is given by Λ∗z = Xz /(αz Y ∗ ), where Xz denotes
total home exports in sector z.
In the granular model, the realized foreign share is a random variable, which depends
on the productivity of the home and foreign firms in sector z. These productivity draws
are shaped, in turn, by the fundamental comparative advantage of the sector (Tz /Tz∗ ) and
the idiosyncratic realizations of firm draws from the Poisson-Pareto process described above.
The structure of the model provides a natural decomposition of the foreign share Λz into these
fundamental and granular components. In particular, the expected foreign share, conditional

on fundamental comparative advantage of the sector Tz /Tz∗ , is given by:15
Φz ≡ ET {Λz } = E{Λz | Tz /Tz∗ } =

1
1 + (τ ω)θ · Tz /Tz∗

.

(13)

The expected foreign share Φz decreases in all sectors in the trade cost τ and in the relative
foreign wage rate ω ≡ w∗ /w. Across sectors, variation in Φz is shaped by the fundamental
comparative advantage Tz /Tz∗ . The expression in (13) is familiar from the quantitative trade
literature, following Eaton and Kortum (2002), and it characterizes the realized trade shares in
the continuous limit of our granular model (see Appendix B.1). In short, the granular model
has, in expectation, the same sectoral trade shares as the continuous model.
Due to granularity, however, the realized trade shares Λz differ from their expectation Φz .
We define the discrepancy between the realized and expected shares as the granular residual:
Γz ≡ Λz − Φz ,

ET {Γz } = ET {Λz − Φz } = 0.

such that

(14)

Defined this way, the granular residual Γz is a scalar sufficient statistic for the effect of all

idosyncratic productivity draws within a sector, {ϕz,j }M
i=j and {ϕz,j }j=1 , on the sectoral trade
pattern Λz relative to its expected value Φz . By construction, granular residuals have an expected value of zero and are uncorrelated with the fundamental comparative advantage Φz .
This provides a convenient way to decompose the cross-sectional variation in the realized
trade patterns Λz into the contribution of the fundamental and granular comparative advantage, Φz and Γz , as we do in Section 4.
Note that within-sector granularity does not create extra trade at the aggregate level, compared to the continuous benchmark with the same expected shares. Indeed, total imports are:16

This result applies despite the fact that market shares sz,i are complex non-linear transformation of firm productivity draws ϕz,i , which in particular depend on the endogenous markups µz,i that do not admit an analytical
characterization. Nonetheless, due to the Poisson-Pareto productivity structure and the common entry cost F ,
the distribution of equilibrium market shares conditional on entry in a given market is the same for foreign and
home firms. However, the expected number of entrants differs for foreign and home firms, and its ratio is given
by Φz . The formal derivation of (13) is provided in Appendix B.2.
16
Similarly, X = Φ∗ Y ∗ is the aggregate value of exports. Due to local fixed costs, the trade balance in general
is not X = X ∗ , but is instead
Φ [Y − wF K] = Φ∗ [Y ∗ − w∗ F ∗ K ∗ ] ,
where K and K ∗ denote the total number of firms serving the two markets across all sectors. Indeeed, [Y −wF K]
are aggregate sales in the home market net of fixed entry costs, and a fraction Φ of these net sales is foreign
income from exports. See Appendix B.2 for the derivation of (15) and the resulting simplification of the general
equilibrium system (9)–(11).

where Φ ≡ EΦz = 0 αz Φz dz is the aggregate foreign share, which integrates Φz across
sectors with different fundamental comparative advantage Tz /Tz∗ . The aggregate amount of
trade in a continuous model is also given by X ∗ = ΦY . While granularity does not create extra
trade in the aggregate, it changes the distribution of trade flows across sectors, contributing
to the patterns of a country’s comparative advantage.

Estimation of the Granular Model

In a continuous trade model, the observed trade flows are assumed to be shaped entirely by
the fundamental forces Φz in (13), making estimation and quantification of the continuous
model particularly straightforward (see Eaton and Kortum 2002, and the vast quantitative literature it gave rise to). In contrast, the observed trade flows in a granular model confound
both fundamental and idiosyncratic (granular) forces, Λz = Φz + Γz . This poses an interesting
identification challenge, which we address in this section. We first describe the data, and then
detail our estimation procedure, present the estimation results and discuss the fit of the model.

3.1

Data

We estimate a two-country model with France as home and the rest of the world (ROW) as
foreign. We use a dataset of French firms (BRN), which reports information on the balance
sheets of firms declared for tax purposes. All firms with revenues over 730,000 euros are included. It reports in particular information on both domestic and export sales, as well as 4-digit
industry classification, at the firm level. We use 2005 as our reference year for estimation. We
match this data with international trade data from Comtrade, to get the aggregate imports and
exports of France in each industry.17 This leaves us with Ñ = 119 manufacturing sectors at
the 4-digit level with an average of about 350 French firms per sector.
We use tildes to denote the empirical variables that correspond to the theoretical objects
that can be measured in the granular model of Section 2. The merged data allows us to construct French sectoral expenditure α̃z Ỹ as the sum of sectoral imports X̃z∗ and domestic sales
z
of all French firms {r̃z,j }M̃
j=1 , where j is the rank of French firms and M̃z is the observed number of French firms in each sector z = 1, ..., Ñ . Taking the ratio of sectoral imports to sectoral
∗
expenditure, we obtain the foreign share in the home market Λ̃z = α̃X̃zỸ . Additionally, we
z
introduce a measure of French export intensity:
17

The industry classification used in the French data is the French NAF (based on European NACE classification), whereas the trade data uses ISIC rev3. We convert the French data into the ISIC rev3 classification using
the crosswalk between NACE and ISIC available from UNstats.

where we normalize exports by domestic expenditure. In the model, this measure is proporY
tional to the French export share, Λ∗z = Λ∗0
z Y ∗ , but is easier to measure since we do not observe
sectoral expenditure in the ROW.
Lastly, we construct the relative sales share of each French firm among all domestic firms
in the domestic market:18

z , M̃z , {s̃z,j }j=1 z=1 to estimate the model using a
simulated method of moments procedure (SMM), which we describe next.

3.2

Estimation procedure

For estimation, we parameterize the fundamental comparative advantage across sectors as
draws from a log-normal distribution with parameters µT and σT , that is:

log Tz /Tz∗ ∼ N (µT , σT2 ).

(18)

Hanson, Lind, and Muendler (2016) show evidence that the distribution of measured comparative advantage across countries and sectors is well-approximated by a log-normal distribution,
a property that we check holds in the estimated version of our granular model under the above
distributional assumption.
With this assumption, we estimate the model parameters in two steps. In the first step,
we calibrate Cobb-Douglas shares from the data as equal to the sectoral expenditure shares,
and we report the histogram of the resulting αz in Appendix Figure A1.19 The relative sectoral
productivity parameters Tz /Tz∗ and the Cobb-Douglas shares αz are the only parameters that
vary across sectors, and in all other respects the sectoral outcomes emerge from a symmetric
data generating process shaped by the remaining model parameters (σ, θ, τ, F ), which in the
baseline case are assumed to be common across sectors and countries.20
18

Note that the sales share s̃z,j differs from the home market share sz,i , used for equilibrium characterization
in Section 2. Specifically, s̃z,j = sz,i(j) /(1 − Λz ), where i(j) is the rank of home firm j among all firms serving
the home market in sector z.
19
In the data, the largest Cobb-Douglas share is 7.5%, the 90th percentile is 1.7%, the median is 0.4% and the
10th percentile is 0.1%. By construction, the mean share is 1/Ñ = 0.8%. In the model, we set αz = Ñ α̃z , so that
the average Eαz = 1, as is required by our model with a continuum of sectors.
20
Our baseline model keeps cross-sectoral parametric heterogeneity to a minimum, yet the estimation procedure can be immediately extended to heterogeneity in other parameters (such as θ, σ and F ) by analogy with
heterogeneity in Tz /Tz∗ , provided the availability of relevant empirical moments for identification. See Section 4
for our robustness analysis, which allows for heterogeneity in productivity parameters θz across sectors.

13

In the second step, we use a simulated method of moments (SMM) procedure to estimate
the six parameters of the model Θ ≡ (σ, θ, τ, F, µT , σT ). The estimation is done in full general
equilibrium, taking into acount in particular the impact of these parameters on firm entry,
heterogeneous markups, and equilibrium prices and quantities. Our approach to statistical
inference in this granular model leverages its multi-sector nature. We view each sector as a
draw from the parametric data generating process (DGP) described in Section 2. The SMM
procedure treats each sector as a (multi-dimensional) observation from the structural DGP,
with parameters that need to be estimated. In particular, we treat the Ñ sectors in the data
as a finite number of draws from a model with a continuum of sectors, and our statistical
inference considers the asymptotics as Ñ increases unboundedly.
For a given parameter vector Θ, we simulate the model, compute a list of cross-sectoral
moments M(Θ), and contrast them with the equivalent moments in the data m̃. We search
for the parameter vector Θ̂ that minimizes the distance between the model and the empirical
0

moments, according to the loss function L(Θ) ≡ M(Θ)− m̃ W M(Θ)− m̃ , where W is a
weighting matrix. Specifically, we search for the best-fitting parameters on a series of coarseto-fine grids, completed by a local minimum search starting from a subset of best-fitting points
from the grid. The full SMM procedure is described in Appendix C.
Normalizations In the model, home and foreign differ in labor endowments L and L∗ . The
model scales with L, as long as we keep L/L∗ and L/F constant. In other words, L simply determines the units of labor, and hence we normalize L = 100, and estimate L∗ /L and F/L. We
calibrate w/w∗ = 1.13, which corresponds to the ratio of wages in France to the average wage
of its trading partners weighted by trade values. As we discuss below, this imposes a general
equilibrium restriction on the other parameters, in particular the relative labor supplies L/L∗ ,
which the procedure estimates along with the model parameters. Given the Cobb-Douglas
preference structure, all variables of interest in the model scale with the common level of
productivity, and therefore we normalize Tz∗ ≡ 1 without loss of generality.21
Lastly, in our estimation, we find that the elasticity of substitution σ and the productivity
parameter θ are weakly separately identified. Indeed, the moments tend to be sensitive to
the ratio κ ≡ θ/(σ − 1), which approximately corresponds to the Pareto tail of the sales
distribution across firms, but not to the values of θ and σ separately. Therefore, we choose to
fix σ = 5 and estimate the constrained model with five parameters Θ0 = (θ, τ, F, µT , σT ).22
This reduces the parameter space and improves the precision of estimation for the remaining
parameters.
21

Note that if productivity in sector z doubles in both countries, the quantity in this sector doubles and the
price halves, without any effect on market shares within or across sectors.
22
The value of σ = 5 (within 4-digit sectors) is conventional in the trade literature (see Broda and Weinstein
2006). When we estimate the unrestricted model, we find σ = 4.927, yet imprecisely estimated.

14

3.3

Moments and identification

We target 15 empirical moments, which correspond to averages and standard deviations of
sectoral outcomes. Table 2 summarizes the list of the moments. With 15 moments, the model
with 5 parameters is overidentified, and variation in any of the parameters tends to affect all
moments simultaneously. Nonetheless, some parameters are particularly sensitive to specific
moments (see Andrews, Gentzkow, and Shapiro 2017). We provide here a discussion of the
main forces ensuring identification.
First, we target the cross-sectoral mean and standard deviation of the log number of French
firms operating in the domestic market, log M̃z . Intuitively, the fixed cost parameter F is
particularly sensitive to the average number of firms, which is the key moment in identifying it. Second, we target the average and standard deviation across sectors of two measures of
within-industry concentration — the relative size of the largest and top-3 largest French firms
P
within-industry relative to other French firms, that is s̃z,1 and 3j=1 s̃z,j , as defined in (17).
The parameter combination κ = θ/(σ − 1) is particularly sensitive to these moments. Recall that κ is closely associated with the shape parameter of the sales distribution, and hence
determines the average industry concentration.23 Therefore, given the calibrated value of the
elasticity of substitution σ, the concentration moments are key in identifying the productivity
parameter θ, as we illustrate in the Appendix Figure A3.
Third, we target a set of five moments describing cross-sectoral patterns of international
trade. In particular, we target the averages and standard deviations of import shares in the
French market Λ̃z , and of export sales of French firms relative to domestic expenditure Λ̃∗0
z,
given in (16). These trade moments help identify the size of the trade cost τ and the average
productivity advantage of France µT . Indeed, from (13), expected foreign shares (Φz and Φ∗z )
are both decreasing in τ , while one is decreasing and the other is increasing in Tz /Tz∗ , which
has a mean governed by µT . Furthermore, the value of σT , the standard deviation of the home
country relative productivities, is particularly sensitive to the variation of trade shares across
sectors. Finally, we target the fraction of French sectors in which export sales exceed the
overall domestic sales of French firms. Due to trade costs, such sectors can emerge only when
the ROW is larger than France, Y ∗ > Y . Therefore, this moment identifies the relative size of
France, Y /Y ∗ and L/L∗ , given the calibrated value of the relative wages ω = w∗ /w.24
The final four moments capture the correlations between French import and export shares,
23

In a granular Zipf’s world (i.e., when κ ≈ 1), the number of firms in a sector (and hence the value of the
fixed cost F ) has only a small effect on the size of the largest firms. We use this correlation moment below as an
external check of the fit of the estimated model.
24
While this moment is directly informative of the relative size of the two economies, the model is also constrained by the general equilibrium trade balance restriction, Φ[Y − wF K] = Φ∗ [Y ∗ − w∗ F ∗ K ∗ ], which links
the aggregate import shares, Φ and Φ∗ , with the relative size of the two economies.

∗0
we target the regression coefficients of Λ̃z and Λ̃z separately on s̃z,1 and j=1 s̃z,j , controlling
in all four regressions for the size of the sector (log total domestic expenditure, log α̃z Ỹ ). We
denote these regression coefficients with b̂j and b̂∗j for j ∈ {1, 3} respectively. These moments
are instrumental for identifying the relative importance of fundamental versus granular forces
in shaping trade shares. In a continuous model, trade flows are shaped exclusively by the
expected productivity of a sector, and conditional on it should not be related to the moments
of the relative size distribution of firm sales. In the data, however, we see a clear correlation
pattern — sectors with more concentrated sales at the top have larger export shares, while
there is no clear relationship for import shares. As we illustrate in the Appendix Figure A3,
the model can capture this only with a particular combination of κ and σT , where the two
parameters shape, respectively, the granular and fundamental forces.

3.4

Estimation results and model fit

Estimated parameters Table 1 reports the SMM estimates of the model parameters and
their standard errors (described in Appendix C), along with the corresponding auxiliary variables implied by the general equilibrium of the estimated model. Overall, the parameters of
the model are quite precisely estimated.
We point out a few features of the estimated parameters. First, κ = θ/(σ − 1) that controls
the Pareto shape parameter of the sales distribution is estimated to equal 1.08, somewhat
above 1, hence exhibiting thinner tails relative to Zipf’s law (see Gabaix 2009). Since granular
phenomena are stronger when distributions have thicker tails, our estimated model offers a
conservative bound on the role of granularity in trade flows, as we further discuss below.
Next, we estimate µT to be positive, albeit small. A positive µT means that France has
on average slightly better productivity draws relative to its trade partners, in line with the
calibrated higher wage rate w/w∗ = 1.13. The estimated value of σT = 1.4, the standard deviation of fundamental comparative advantage, is large. It suggests that in the cross-section of
sectors, a one standard deviation increase in fundamental comparative advantage corresponds
to a four-fold increase in the relative productivity of the two countries. Below, we discuss the
relative role of κ = 1.08 and σT = 1.4 in generating the patterns of trade across sectors.
We find that the iceberg trade costs are τ = 1.34, broadly in line with the estimates in
the literature (see Anderson and van Wincoop 2004). Note that the estimated model implies
that France is 1.7 times smaller than the rest of the world in terms of population (and 1.5
times smaller in terms of GDP). This is, of course, an abstraction of a two-country model with
a common iceberg trade cost τ separating the two regions. The appropriate interpretation
of L∗ /L in the model is the relative size of the ROW, in which the individual countries are

discounted by their economic distance to France (i.e., if countries trade little with France, their
population weight is heavily discounted). The model implies an aggregate share of profits in
GDP (Π/Y ) equal to 21%, broadly in line with the national income accounts, without being
targeted in the estimation procedure.
Model fit Table 2 reports the model-based values of the 15 moments used in estimation,
and compares them with their empirical counterparts. The table also reports the percentage
contribution of each moment to the overall loss function L(Θ̂), as we describe in Appendix C.
Overall, the model provides a reasonable fit to the data for the 15 moments targeted in estimation, as we now discuss. In addition, the Appendix Figure A4 shows the fit of the model
over the whole distribution of sectoral outcomes, rather than just for the means and standard
deviations reported in Table 2.
The model accurately matches the distribution of the number of firms across sectors. The
median sector has around 350 French firms with a large variation across sectors: a sector at the
25th percentile has just over 100 firms and a sector at the 75th percentile has over 700 firms.
The model also fits well the average size of the largest and top-3 largest French firms, which
are about 20% and 35% of the overall French-firm sales, respectively. The ability of the model
to closely replicate the distribution of the number of firms and the market shares of the large
firms across sectors is important in the quantitative analysis of granularity. Furthermore, in
the model, like in the data, average export and import shares across French manufacturing
sectors are both around 35%.25
The regression coefficients of the sectoral trade share on either the top-firm or top-3 domestic sales shares in the data are 0.20–0.25 for exports and around zero for imports, and
the model matches these patterns accurately. The table further reports the OLS standard errors for these regression coefficients, and the model is able to reproduce them as well, even
though they are not targeted in estimation. In particular, the regression coefficients for the

Note that trade is balanced in the model, which is not far from the small empirical manufacturing trade
deficit that France ran in 2005.

export share are significant with t-statistics over 2, while the coefficients for import shares are
well-estimated zeros with t-statistics close to zero.
In contrast, one moment where the fit of the model is not as good is the fraction of sectors
with exports exceeding domestic sales: the model predicts 9% of such sectors against 18% in
the data. Note that the presence of such sectors is only possible in a model with Y ∗ > Y ,
i.e. when France is smaller than the ROW. Our simplified two-country geography is likely the
reason why the model has a hard time matching this moment. This is the only moment for
which the model is off by a substantial amount, accounting for 38% of the loss function (the
SMM objective), as can be seen in the last column of Table 2.
Moments not targeted in estimation We consider here a series of overidentification checks
by exploring the fit of the moments not targeted directly in our estimation procedure. First,
we consider an additional measure of concentration by estimating the Pareto shape parame18

ter κ̂z of domestic sales of French firms, industry-by-industry. Specifically, we follow Gabaix
and Ibragimov (2011) and estimate by OLS:
log(j − 0.5) = const − κ̂z · log s̃z,j + κz,j ,
Data:
Model:

(19)

1.015

[0.817, 1.208]

1.096

[1.010, 1.169]

where j is the domestic-sales rank of French firms in industry z, and we only use the top 25%
of firms in each industry.26 A lower κ̂z corresponds to a more fat-tailed (concentrated) sales
distribution. The display above reports the mean and the interquartile range of κ̂z , estimated
in the data and in the model. On average across sectors, the distribution of domestic sales
exhibits Zipf’s law, i.e. the estimated Pareto shape parameter is equal to 1.015, close to 1.
However, there is a substantial variation across sectors, with the interquartile range given by
[0.82, 1.21]. The model somewhat overstates the mean of κ̂z , at 1.096, and understates the
variation across sectors, with the interquartile range [1.01, 1.17].27 With a less fat-tailed sales
distribution compared to the data, the model therefore offers a conservative bound for the role
of granularity, as we explore in the following section.
Our second overidentification check considers the joint distribution of French-firm sales
and the number of French firms across sectors. In particular, we regress the relative size of
the largest French firm s̃z,1 on the log domestic absorption Ỹz = α̃z Ỹ and the log-number of
French firms M̃z in the sector:
s̃z,1 = const + γM · log M̃z + γY · log Ỹz + sz

The display above reports the OLS-estimated semi-elasticities and their standard errors. In
sectors with more French firms, the relative size of the largest French firm is smaller, however
this relationship is not very steep. Conditional on the number of firms, the size of the sector
(measured by domestic absorption) has a small positive correlation with the relative size of the
largest firm. The model is successful at capturing these empirical patterns. Granular forces
are likely to be shaped by both the number of firms M̃z and the relative size of the largest
26

The results are similar for the sample of top 50% of firms.
θ
Recall that in the model the average shape parameter is closely related to κ = σ−1
= 1.077, and is slightly
higher (less fat-tailed) due to variable markups. Indeed, the markups are higher for larger firms, and hence the
sales distribution is less concentrated than would be the case under constant markups.

firm s̃z,1 , and thus it is important that our model replicates not only their partial distributions
(in Appendix Figure A4), but also their joint distribution across sectors.
From this analysis, we conclude that the model is capable of capturing the salient features
of the cross-sector variation in the number of firms, top-firm market shares, trade shares and
measures of concentration. The model is also successful at capturing the patterns of joint variation of some of these variables. This is, perhaps, surprising given the tightness of the model
parameterization, which features only five parameters common across sectors and countries.
The granularity mechanism results in rich variations across sectors that mimic the patterns
observed in the data.
Equilibrium markups We close by briefly commenting on the equilibrium markup variation across firms displayed in the estimated model. The oligopolistic competition in our granular model results in heterogeneous markups, with larger firms setting higher markups, as
given by (7). However, under Bertrand competition, the equilibrium variation in markups
is quite limited, as we illustrate in Appendix Figure A2. Indeed, only the largest firm in a
sector charges a markup considerably above 1.25, which would be the value of the constant
σ
= 1.25).
markup in a counterfactual continuous model with monopolistic competition ( σ−1
The markup of the largest firm is 1.30 on average across sectors, and it is as high as 1.37 at the
90th percentile across sectors. In contrast, the third largest firm in a sector charges a markup
just under 1.26 on average across sectors and with little cross-sectoral variation. This is almost indistinguishable from the monopolistic-competition markup. Therefore, the abstraction
with constant markups used in much of the granularity literature is reasonable, except for the
largest one or two firms in an industry. These firms, however, can be pivotal for sectoral
outcomes, as well as for trade and industrial policies that we study below.

Quantifying Granular Trade

Armed with the estimated model, we now study the extent to which granularity shapes trade
patterns. Recall from equation (12)–(14) that sectoral trade flows Xz are determined by three
factors: (i) sectoral expenditure shares αz , (ii) fundamental comparative advantage Φz , and (iii)
granular comparative advantage, driven by outstanding firms and summarized by the granular
residual Γz . That is, total sectoral exports can be expressed as follows:
Xz = αz Λ∗z Y ∗

and

Λ∗z = Φ∗z + Γ∗z .

Table 3 reports the decomposition of trade flows into the above three sources of variation,
in the estimated model (column 1). The other columns of the table report robustness results,
which we discuss below.

Note: The lower panel reports averages across simulated sectors; κ̂z is estimated as in (19); bold emphasizes
the targeted moment in each specification. Specifications: (1) Baseline estimated model. (2) Counterfactual with
σ = 5.34 (instead of σ = 5) to match the average estimated Pareto shape (κ̂z ) equal to 1.02. In (3)–(5), σ = 5
and θz are sector-specific: (3) θz set such that θz /(σ − 1) = κ̂z in the data (the estimated Pareto shapes sectorby-sector). (4) like (3), but proportionally scaling θz down to match the average of κ̂z (since θz /(σ − 1) > κ̂z due
to variable markups). (5) like (3), but proportionally scaling θz up to match the average top-firm sales share s̃z,1
(relative to other home firms in the home market; moment 3 in Table 2). See Appendix Figure A5 for the fit of
the model across these specifications.

We first report the contribution of the granular residual Γ∗z to the variation in export
shares Λ∗z across sectors, using the following variance decomposition:
var(Λ∗z ) = var(Φ∗z ) + var(Γ∗z ).

(20)

By construction, Γ∗z is a mean-zero granular residual, which is uncorrelated with the fundamental comparative advantage Φ∗z , and hence this decomposition holds exactly without a
covariance term. In our estimated model, we find that granularity shapes 17% of the variation
in export shares across sectors, while the rest corresponds to fundamental comparative advantage. In turn, export shares Λ∗z account for 57% of the variation in overall trade flows Xz ,
while the rest is accounted for by sectoral expenditure shares αz .28
By construction, the granular contribution to trade flows is zero on average across sectors,
and granularity does not create additional trade at the aggregate level. Instead, granularity
creates additional trade flows in the granular sectors, which is compensated by missing trade
in the non-granular sectors, as we investigate next. Here and below, we refer to a sector as
granular if Γ∗z  0, while if Γ∗z < 0 or Γ∗z ≈ 0 we label such sectors non-granular, even though
ex ante all sectors are symmetric in terms of their expected granularity, as EΓ∗z = 0 for every z.
We measure the contribution of export shares to the overall sectoral exports as var(log Λ∗z )/var(log Xz ).
The exact variance decomposition of Xz is var(log Xz ) = var(log αz ) + var(log Λ∗z ) + 2cov(log αz , log Λ∗z ). In
the estimated model, cov(log αz , log Λ∗z ) ≈ 0, and therefore there is no need to allocate the covariance term.

Deciles of sectors, by export intensity Λ∗z

Figure 1: Export intensity and granularity
Note: All sectors are split into 10 deciles (bins of equal size in terms of the number of sectors) based on their export
share, Λ∗z = Xz /(αz Y ∗ ). The left panel plots for each decile the fraction of sectors for which Γ∗z /Λ∗z ≥ ϑ ∈
{1/2, 1/3, 1/4}. For example, the cumulative height of the blue and red bars corresponds to the fraction of sectors
for which Γ∗z ≥ 13 Λ∗z , or equivalently Γ∗z ≥ 12 Φ∗z . The right panel plots the contribution of deciles to aggregate
trade (dashed blue bars) and the contribution of granular trade (Γ∗z αz Y ∗ ) to aggregate exports X = Φ∗ Y ∗ (solid
red bars), by deciles of sectors. The figures are based on a simulation of the estimated model with 10,000 sectors.

Figure 1 illustrates that the effects of granularity are particularly pronounced in the most
export-intensive sectors, i.e. in the export champions of the country. This can be seen in two
ways. Panel (a) illustrates that the likelihood of a sector being granular tends to increase with
the export intensity of the sector Λ∗z .29 Panel (b) plots the corresponding export flows. As in
panel (a), sectors are grouped by deciles of export intensity. The figure shows the contribution
of each decile to the country’s total exports (dashed blue bars), and highlights with red solid
bars the contribution of granular trade to the total sectoral exports.30 Note that the cumulative
height of all blue bars is 1 (aggregate exports), while the cumulative height of all red bars is
zero, as granularity does not change the aggregate amount of trade. The top three deciles of
export-intensive sectors account for two thirds of the aggregate exports. These are exactly the
sectors where the granular contribution to trade is positive on net, and accounts for a substantial fraction of trade flows. In all other bins of less-export-intensive sectors, the contribution of
granular trade is negative, that is, these sectors would export slightly more in the continuous
limit of the model.
Specifically, the figure groups sectors into deciles of export intensity Λ∗z , and reports for each decile the share
of sectors where granular exports are important, representing more than 1/4 (1/3, or 1/2, respectively) of the total
sectoral exports.

Overall, granularity shapes trade flows, and does so in a concentrated way among the
most export-intensive sectors. An outstanding productivity draw in a sector (i.e., a very large
firm) tends to have a major positive impact for production and exports in this sector, while
the absence of such a draw in a sector (i.e., no outsized firm) tends to only have a moderate
negative impact. This is balanced out by the fact that the presence of an outstanding draw is a
rare outcome. Taken together, these forces add skewness to the distribution of export intensity
across sectors in a granular economy.
Robustness Our baseline model features only two sources of ex-ante heterogeneity across
sectors: the Cobb-Douglas expenditure shares αz and fundamental productivities Tz /Tz∗ , whereas
in reality, sectors are likely to be heterogeneous in a number of different ways. One may thus
worry that our results are sensitive to this simplifying assumption, and that we overstate the
role of granularity by shutting down such heterogeneity. In particular, variation in firm size
distribution is likely to be in part due to these other sources of heterogeneity, rather than
driven by granularity alone.
To address this issue, we recalibrate the model by allowing for sector-specific θz , i.e. the parameters that govern the dispersion in firm productivity draws within sectors. In a continuous
model, variation in this parameter is a natural way to obtain variation in firm-size distribution
across sectors (see e.g. di Giovanni and Levchenko 2012, 2013). We discipline the distribution
of θz across sectors in three alternative ways, with results reported in the last three columns
θz
= κ̂z for all sectors, where {κ̂z } are the empiriof Table 3. First, we choose θz so that σ−1
cal estimates of the Pareto shapes of the firm size distribution in the data (from (19)). With a
θz
continuum of firms and constant markups, σ−1
exactly corresponds to the Pareto shape of the
sales distribution, but a granular model with variable markups introduces a wedge between
the two. Therefore, our second calibration proportionally scales down the distribution of θz to
ensure that the mean value of the estimated Pareto shape parameters in the model, κ̂z , matches
the one in the data. Third, since both of these calibrations overstate somewhat the average
sales share of the largest firm relative to the data (and relative to the baseline model, which
matches this moment), we scale up the distribution of θz to match the top sales share moment.
The bottom panel of Table 3 and the Appendix Figure A5 illustrate the fit of different moments
across these three specifications. In particular, the calibrated model can now accurately match
the distribution of the estimated Pareto shape coefficients κ̂z in the data.
Interestingly, Table 3 shows that the contribution of granularity increases, across all three
specifications, compared to our baseline calibration with homogeneous θ across sectors. The
contribution of granularity now ranges from 20% to 28%. Intuitively, the strength of granularity is largely determined by the market share of the largest firm in the sector (see Table A1 and

23

the discussion below). Having heterogeneous θz does not change the ability of the model to
match the relative size of the largest firms. However, with heterogeneous θz , some sectors end
up having smaller θz , and as a result even fatter-tailed sales distributions and larger top firms.
This additional skewness increases the role of granularity in shaping the economic outcomes.
Overall, this robustness exercise suggests that our baseline estimate of the role of granularity
is, if anything, conservative.
As another robustness check, the second column of Table 3 reports the sensitivity of our
results to the elasticity of substitution of demand, σ. We do this for two reasons. First, as we
noted above, our estimation procedure is conservative in that we target the market share of
the top firms, but understate the fatness of the tail of the sales distribution, as measured by the
Pareto shape κ̂z . We report here what would be the outcome of a less conservative estimation
procedure, which would target instead the measured Pareto shapes of the firm-size distribution
(i.e., Zipf’s law). Second, we note that the literature has been documenting an increase in
concentration within industries (see e.g. Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen 2017,
Gutiérrez and Philippon 2017). A common hypothesis is that it corresponds to an increased
substitutability across products σ, for example due to the increased online competition.31 Here
we are interested in understanding the possible consequences of this increase for the role
of granularity in shaping trade flows. We therefore consider a counterfactual with a larger
elasticity of substitution σ = 5.34 (versus σ = 5 in the baseline). It allows the model to match
exactly the average estimated Pareto shape parameter in the data (equal to 1.02; see (19)). We
find that the contribution of granularity to sectoral export shares increases from 17% to 22%.
Quite intuitively, the role of granularity increases as the economy becomes more concentrated.
Inference on sectoral comparative advantage Having established the quantitative relevance of granularity in shaping the sectoral trade flows, we now ask the following question:
Given the observed export stance of a sector, what inference can one make on its fundamental comparative advantage? In a conventional continuous model, there is a one-to-one mapping from the observed trade flows into the fundamental comparative advantage Tz /Tz∗ , as
Λ∗z = Φ∗z in this case, a feature that is used extensively in the quantitative trade literature
following Eaton and Kortum (2002). The presence of granularity complicates this inference,
as export shares Λ∗z now reflect both fundamental and granular sources of comparative advantage. The ability to draw inference on this split is important if fundamental and granular
comparative advantage have different implications, for example, for the dynamics of trade
flows, as we explore in Section 5.
31

A natural microfoundation for this mechanism is a frictional discrete choice model with decreasing search
costs over time (see e.g. Hortacsu and Syverson 2014).

Figure 2: Comparative advantage and trade flows: distribution across realizations
Note: The figures plot moments and percentiles of the conditional distributions: Λ∗z |Φ∗z in the left panel and
Φ∗z |Λ∗z in the right panel. In both figures, the red solid 45◦ -line corresponds to Λ∗z = Φ∗z , towards which the
distributions degenerate in a continuous model. The vertical dotted lines plot the percentiles of the unconditional
partial distribution of Φ∗z in the left panel and of Λ∗z in the right panel. The figures are based on a simulation of
the estimated model with 100,000 sectors.

As a first step, we use the estimated model to plot, in the left panel of Figure 4, the distribution of realized export intensity Λ∗z conditional on the fundamental comparative advantage
of a sector Φ∗z . The one-to-one deterministic mapping between the two in the continuous
model is depicted with a red 45◦ -line. In the granular model, export shares conditional on the
fundamental forces are now random, reflecting the granular draws. Their conditional mean
is depicted with a dashed blue line, which coincides with the red line. There is substantial
variation in actual realizations, which is seen from the dotted lines that correspond to the
percentiles of the conditional distribution of Λ∗z |Φ∗z . The vertical departures from the 45◦ -line
correspond to the realizations of the sectoral granular residuals, Γ∗z = Λ∗z − Φ∗z .32 This figure
complements the decomposition in Table 3 in illustrating the contribution of granularity to
sectoral trade shares.
The right panel of Figure 4 describes instead the conditional distribution of Φ∗z |Λ∗z , that is,
the inference one can make on the fundamental Φ∗z conditional on observing a realized export
share Λ∗z . To that end, the right panel switches the axes of the left panel. The continuous
model is again represented by the solid red diagonal line. In the granular model, inference
is very different. The conditional expectation of Φ∗z given the observed Λ∗z is depicted with a
blue dashed line, which unlike in the left panel now departs from the red diagonal. In other
For example, at the 75th percentile of Φ∗z = 0.33, the interquartile range of Λ∗z |Φ∗z is [0.27, 0.40], and its 90th
percentile is 0.49, corresponding to almost the 90th percentile of the unconditional distribution of Λ∗z .
32

words, the sectoral Φ∗z |Λ∗z is not symmetric or even centered around Λ∗z , as was the case for
Λ∗z |Φ∗z in the left panel. This reflects the pattern we already observed in Figure 1, namely that
sectors with small realized export shares tend to have negative granular residuals and sectors
with large realized export shares tend have positive granular residuals. Therefore, sectors with
the largest realized export shares have systematically lower expected export shares, Φ∗z < Λ∗z ,
i.e. a lower fundamental comparative advantage than a continuous model would predict.33
In other words, using a continuous model to estimate fundamental sectoral productivities in
a granular world would lead to a systematic positive bias for high export-intensity sectors.
Inference on sectoral granularity We next use the estimated model to study the covariation properties of the granular trade share Γ∗z , which is unobservable in the data, with variables that are, in contrast, observable in the data. The goal of this analysis is to establish
effective measurable proxies for granularity. This acts as a check of our identification strategy
in Section 3 and provides input for further empirical investigation of granular trade flows.
In particular, we use these insights below to estimate the likelihood that sectoral exports have
a large granular component, for each French sector in our dataset.
By construction, the granular share Γ∗z is uncorrelated with sectoral fundamental productivity advantage captured by Φ∗z . We find, furthermore, that Γ∗z is largely uncorrelated with a
number of sector-level variables, including the size of the sector, measured by total expenditure log(αz Y ), and the total number of French firms serving the sector, log M̃z . This emphasizes that granularity is not merely a reflection of a small number of firms. In contrast, the
variable that is most closely associated with Γ∗z is the relative size of the largest French firm, as
captured by its domestic sales share relative to other French firms in the sector, s̃z,1 .34 A sector
in which the largest French firm has a 10 percentage points higher sales share relative to other
French firms has on average a 3.5 percentage points higher export share to the foreign market,
entirely of granular origin. Note that s̃z,1 does not contain any direct information on the firm’s
advantage over its foreign rivals, yet it signals the likelihood that the best domestic firm is a
granular outlier, and hence predicts exports.
To conclude, simple statistics characterizing within-sector firm-size distribution, such as s̃z,1 ,
offer powerful proxies for the overall role of granularity in a sector and the aggregate sectoral
outcomes, such as sectoral exports. This equilibrium statistical association was at the core of
33

This corresponds to a classical selection (or reversion-to-the-mean) effect: a sector-outlier is only in part
shaped by fundamental forces, and the less so the more of an outlier it is. From the right panel of Figure 4, note
that over 70% of sectors (with smallest Λ∗z ) have E{Φ∗z |Λ∗z } > Λ∗z , and it is only the most export-intensive sectors
that share the reverse feature (indeed, unconditionally, EΦ∗z = EΛ∗z ).
34
This variable alone can explain about 35% of variation in Γ∗z , and when it is combined with a foreign counterpart s̃∗z,1 , they together explain over a half of granular trade. Additional variables, including other measures of
concentration and skewness in the domestic sales shares, improve the fit only marginally. We summarize these
results in Appendix Table A1.

Note: Colors (see scale on the right) reflect the probability that at least 25% of the export share Λ∗z in a sector

our empirical identification strategy in Section 3.2, as captured by the last four moments in
Table 2 (see also Navaretti, Bugamelli, Forlani, and Ottaviano 2016, who explore the predictive
ability of skewness in the firm-sales distribution for sectoral trade flows).
Lastly, we use the insights from this analysis, and briefly address the possibility of identifying specific granular sectors in the data. This is a challenging task, as neither Φ∗z nor Γ∗z are
observable, and the inference must be made using only the overall trade share Λ∗z and the observable proxies for granularity, such as the relative size of the largest firm s̃z,1 . Nonetheless,
one can make a Bayesian inference of the probability that exports in a given sector z are of a
significant granular origin, e.g. Γ∗z ≥ ϑΛ∗z for some cutoff ϑ ∈ (0, 1), as we defined in Figure 1.
We plot the estimated granular probabilities for the French sectors in Figure 3 and detail the
estimation procedure in Appendix C.

Dynamics of Comparative Advantage

Having established the implications of granularity for cross-sectional trade patterns, we now
extend our granular model to allow for industry dynamics driven by idiosyncratic firm productivity shocks, and study its implications for the evolution of a country’s comparative advantage over time. This line of analysis brings us closer to the macro granularity literature
that, following Gabaix (2011), focuses on aggregate fluctuations.
27

5.1

Dynamic model

We introduce dynamics by assuming that the productivity of each firm evolves over time according to a random growth process. As a consequence, individual firm market shares change
over time, as well as the granular comparative advantage and the resulting sectoral trade patterns. Note that in a continuous model, in contrast, such firm-level idiosyncratic volatility
would have no impact on sectoral trade shares.
We assume that the productivity ϕz,i,t of firm i in sector z at period t evolves according
to a geometric random walk with downward drift µ < 0 and a reflecting barrier at the lower
bound ϕz . Specifically, if the resulting ϕz,i,t ≥ ϕz , then
log ϕz,i,t = µ + log ϕz,i,t−1 + νεz,i,t ,

εz,i,t ∼ iid N (0, 1),

(21)

otherwise, log ϕz,i,t is reflected symmetrically away from the lower bound ϕz .35 The negative
drift term µ = −θν 2 /2 ensures stationarity of the cross-sectional productivity distribution,
which is Pareto with shape parameter θ (see Gabaix 2009), like in the static model. This productivity process applies to all shadow firms in the economy. There is no entry or exit: the
pool of shadow firms remains constant over time. Shadow firms decide each period whether
to pay a per-period fixed cost and be active, or be inactive. Since firms do not incur sunk costs
of entry, their choice of operating in each period is a static one. As a result, the equilibrium of
this dynamic model is a sequence of static equilibria: each period, firms play the static entry
and price-setting game described in Section 2, given the current productivity distribution. This
allows us to embed, in a tractable way, a persistent dynamic process for firm-level productivity
that, in particular, affects the evolution of sectoral trade in the granular economy over time.
Quantitatively, we discipline the idiosyncratic productivity process using the evolution of
firm market shares in the French data over 11 years, 1997 to 2007. The only new parameter that needs to be calibrated is the standard deviation of productivity innovations ν. Importantly, this parameter does not affect any of the static moments used in estimation. We
choose to target two moments of the domestic sales shares s̃z,i,t dynamics: namely, the (inverse) short-run persistence measured by std(∆s̃z,i,t+1 ) and the long-run persistence measured by corr(s̃z,i,t+10 , s̃z,i,t ), where we average across sectors z (and firms i, for the former
moment), and one period corresponds to a year. Targeting these moments leads to ν = 0.05.36


Formally, if µ+log ϕz,i,t−1 +νεz,i,t < log ϕz , then log ϕz,i,t = log ϕz + log ϕz −(µ+log ϕz,i,t−1 +νεz,i,t ) .
Recall that ϕz is also the lower bound for the initial productivity draws, which are obtained according to the same
Poisson-Pareto process as in the static model. ϕz is normalized to be a small number that never binds in the entry
game; this parameter is of no consequence otherwise.
36
With ν = 0.05, the model slightly overstates the short-run persistence and slightly understates the long-run
persistence (see Table 4). Setting ν = 0.053 allows to match std(∆s̃z,i,t+1 ) = 0.0018, while setting ν = 0.045
allows to match corr(s̃z,i,t+10 , s̃z,i,t ) = 0.86. The quantitative results change little with this variation: namely,
the 20-year turnover moment in Table 4 changes from 72% to 70% as we increase ν from 0.045 to 0.053.
35

28

Note that this calibration of dynamics does not rely on any trade-related moments.
We use the calibrated dynamic model to simulate the dynamic equilibrium path of the
economy over an extended period of time, in order to explore the implications of granularity
for the dynamics of comparative advantage.

5.2

Granular dynamics of comparative advantage

In a recent paper, Hanson, Lind, and Muendler (2016; henceforth, HLM) study the dynamic
evolution of the comparative advantage of countries. We take their study as a benchmark.
They emphasize two striking patterns:
(i) hyper-specialization of exports: a single sector accounts for 21% of a country’s total exports on average across countries, while the three top sectors account for over 40%.
For France, these two concentration ratios are somewhat lower, equal to 17% and 30%
respectively. Our estimated granular model reproduces this, as we report in Table 4.37
(ii) high turnover of comparative advantage: a sector in the top-5 of sectors by export intensity has about a 50-50 chance of staying in the top-5 two decades later.
The combination of these two facts is indeed intriguing: countries appear to exhibit extreme
specialization, yet their comparative advantage tends to change significantly in the medium
run. We argue here that granular effects can rationalize these patterns. To show this, we
quantify how much turnover in the comparative advantage of sectors is generated by our
quantified granular model with firm dynamics.
We find that firm dynamics in the granular model generate mean reversion in sectoral
export patterns. A sector in the top 5% in terms of export intensity only has a 71% chance
to remain there two decades later. This is exclusively due to idiosyncratic shocks to firm
productivity: there is no change over time in the fundamental comparative advantage of sectors. Therefore, quantitatively, this granular force alone can explain over 60% of the sectoral
turnover documented by HLM. Furthermore, it can explain almost all the turnover we observe
in the French data, where a sector among the top-5 in terms of export intensity in the beginning of our sample has an 80% chance to remain in the top 5 by the end of the sample, 10 years
later. In comparison, our simulated model predicts a 79% chance over a 10-year horizon.38
37

HLM split all products into 113 sectors, so we interpret top-1, top-3 and top-5 respectively as top-1%, top-3%
and top-5% of sectors in the context of our model with a large number (continuum) of sectors. HLM show that
small developing countries exhibit more extreme patterns of both specialization and mean reversion, and anecdotally FDI likely plays an important role in this (e.g., Intel operations in Costa Rica). Since we focus on France,
a large developed country, we report the moments from HLM which correspond to the subsample of developed
countries. Table 4 also reports the corresponding moments in our French data with 119 manufacturing sectors.
38
Appendix Figure A6 plots the measure of turnover for different horizons T ≥ 0 in the simulated model.
The probability of staying in the top 5% of export-intensive sectors decreases to 65% after 50 years, and it is just
above 50% in the very long-run, reflecting the role of fundamental forces at keeping some sectors at the top of
the export intensity distribution.

the French dataset) and 1% (3% and 5%) of sectors in the model-simulated data (with 25,000 sectors). The export
share moments are based on sectoral exports Λ∗z αz Y ∗ ; the turnover moments are based on export shares Λ∗z .

Recall that we do not target any trade-related moments in the calibration of dynamics, as we
only use the persistence of sales shares of the French firms, among other French firms, in the
domestic market. These results suggest that idiosyncratic firm dynamics is important quantitatively in shaping the observed turnover among the most export-intensive sectors.
More generally, what are the implications of granularity for the dynamics of comparative
advantage across the full range of sectors? To illustrate the role of granularity, we rank sectors
by their granular trade shares Γ∗z in the initial period of the simulation, and group them in 10
bins of equal size (deciles). The left panel of Figure 4 plots the average changes in export shares
∆Λ∗z by decile, over 20 and 50 years. The strongest mean-reversion forces are at play in the
most granular sectors, which tend to lose export shares over time. The non-granular sectors
(with Γ∗z < 0 or Γ∗z ≈ 0) are expected to gain export shares over time, but at a much slower
pace, emphasizing again the skewness inherent in granular outcomes (compare with Figure 1).
The right panel of Figure 4 shows that, in addition to mean reversion, the most granular
sectors also exhibit very volatile export patterns over time. This figure plots the standard
deviation of annual changes in export shares ∆Λ∗z , again by deciles of sectors. By this measure,
the most granular sectors are over five times more volatile than the least granular sectors,
which resonates with the results on aggregate fluctuations in the macro-granularity literature.
This volatility is an order of magnitude larger than the annualized rates of mean reversion in
comparative advantage. That is, while granular sectors tend to mean revert on average and
over longer horizons (panel a), they can also gain considerably in comparative advantage over
a medium run (panel b). This volatility, intrinsic to granular outcomes, emphasizes the need

for a model to study the granular patterns, which would be very difficult to measure directly
in the data with a sufficient degree of precision.
Granularity, openness and sectoral reallocation A natural corollary of what we have
established so far is that, in a granular open economy, firm-level shocks generate production
and labor reallocation, and do so not only between firms, but also across sectors. This allows
the open economy granular model to speak to an important macroeconomic feature of the
data, namely the equilibrium intensity of labor reallocation across industries. Note that, in
contrast, the continuous counterpart of the model predicts no inter-sectoral labor reallocation
triggered by firm-level industry dynamics.
In our simulated dynamic model with idiosyncratic firm productivity shocks, the annual
job creation and job destruction rates are about 12%. Importantly, 19% of this turnover is due
to inter-sectoral job reallocation, reflecting the shifts in production across sectors in response
to granular changes in the country’s comparative advantage. This extent of job turnover, both
within and across sectors, is in line with the empirical patterns documented by Davis and
Haltiwanger (1999; see their Tables 1, 2 and 5). Furthermore, the share of inter-sectoral labor
reallocation in the overall job flows is very sensitive to the degree of openness of the economy,
and it falls to just 3% in an economy virtually closed to international trade. We provide further
details in Appendix Table A2, which also shows that similar patterns of inter-sectoral reallocation hold over longer horizons. These results emphasize the interaction between granularity

Note: Top firm share (blue bars) is the foreign market share of the largest home exporter. Loss in export share

and trade openness in contributing to the increased volatility of resource allocation in open
economies (cf Rodrik 1998).
Individual firm exit Another way to quantify the important role played by individual firms
in shaping comparative advantage is to consider a counterfactual in which the largest firm in
a sector exits the industry for an exogenous reason. We study the impact of this shock on the
export performance of the sector, which would be nil in a continuous model. In our quantified
model, the largest exporter accounts on average for over a quarter of total sectoral exports
and over 6% of the foreign market. If this large exporter exits, its market share is redistributed
towards existing home and foreign firms in the sector, as well as towards new entrants at home
and abroad. The reallocation of this lost market share towards foreign firms reflects a loss in
comparative advantage.
In Figure 5, we look at the comparative-advantage sectors (top 30% of sectors in terms of
export shares Λ∗z that account for over two-thirds of total exports) and group them into deciles
by granular trade shares Γ∗z . We plot the average foreign market share of the largest domestic
exporter (blue bars) and the average loss in sectoral export share when this largest exporter
fails (red bars). In non-granular sectors, the impact of a firm exit is limited. On average, about
half of the exporter’s sales are recaptured by domestic exporters, while the remaining half is
reallocated towards foreign firms. For most sectors this leads only to a mild loss in export
intensity and comparative advantage.
32

The situation is very different, however, for the most granular sectors. In the top decile,
the largest exporter commands as much as a 40% foreign market share, and, importantly, over
70% of it is lost to foreign firms if this largest exporter fails. This results in a sharp loss of
comparative advantage. That is, not only do granular firms matter because they hold a large
share of exports, but also because loosing these firms would generate a disproportionate loss
of sectoral export shares and comparative advantage. In certain cases, sectors may drop entirely from being among the most export-intensive sectors (top 5%) into becoming comparative
disadvantaged (bottom 50%).

Granular Policies in an Open Economy

Having established the role of granularity in shaping static and dynamic trade patterns, we finally turn to exploring its consequences for policy. A range of policies specifically target large
firms. An obvious example is antitrust policy that regulates mergers of firms with significant
market power. Merger policy is often viewed as part of a toolkit that policymakers use to affect
foreign market access (see e.g. Bagwell and Staiger 2004, Chapter 9). Further, countries may
be interested in targeting large foreign firms directly, for example, as part of a trade war. What
impact do these policies have on trade flows and welfare? This question cannot be analyzed
using standard continuous models where, even in the presence of heterogeneity, every firm is
infinitesimal. In contrast, our quantitative granular model is well-suited to analyze the consequences of and the economic motivation behind such policies. In what follows, we explore
in turn two policies: a merger between two large firms in a given sector of an open granular
economy and a granular import tariff imposed on a single large foreign exporter. Before presenting the results, we start by outlining the general methodology we follow to compute and
decompose the welfare effects of policies.
Welfare decomposition In our model, the welfare of a representative consumer at home
R1
is given by W = Y /P , where Y is aggregate home income and P = exp 0 αz log Pz dz
is the price index. In general, aggregate income can be decomposed as Y = wL + Π + T R,
where wL is labor income, Π is aggregate profits defined in (10), and T R is government policy
revenues distributed lump-sum to workers. Since labor is supplied inelastically and we adopt
the home wage as numeraire, the log-change in home welfare in response to a policy can be
expressed as follows:39
Z 1
dΠ dT R
Y
+
−
αz d log Pz dz,
(22)
Ŵ ≡ d log =
P
Y
Y
0
39

Note that the change in the real wage is fully accounted for by the changes in the price level P since nominal
wage w = 1 by our choice of the numeraire; otherwise, there would be an additional term wL
Y d log w.

33

The three components in (22) correspond to the respective changes in the producer surplus,
government revenues, and consumer surplus.
We are interested in the general equilibrium impact of policies targeted at large firms,
and in particular, in contrasting the effects they have in granular versus non-granular sectors. To this end, we study a given policy change in a positive measure of sectors Z that
have similar levels of granularity.40 More concretely, we bin sectors into quintiles by granular export share Γ∗z defined in (14). We then compute the corresponding welfare impact
ŴZ = d log(Y /P ) of the policy in bin Z, and report its average aggregate welfare effect,
normalized by the size of set Z, defined by:41
ŴZ = R

ŴZ .

(23)

We also consider the decomposition of the average welfare effects ŴZ into the contributions
of the changes in the consumer and producer surplus, according to (22).

6.1

Welfare implications of a merger

We study here the welfare consequences of a merger between the two top domestic firms in
a sector, with a binary policy option of whether or not to allow the merger. Mergers and
acquisitions are sought by firms for a range of reasons, including increasing their market
power, realizing cost synergies and transferring core competencies and best practices. We
capture these channels in the following way. First, we assume that, upon merging, the single
entity continues to produce the two distinct product lines previously produced by the two
separate firms, but that it now sets markups to maximize the total profit of the merged entity.
As a consequence, the new firm’s market power and markups increase.42 Second, we assume
that the merged firm pays only one fixed cost rather than two. We note however that this
assumption is largely inconsequential quantitatively, as fixed costs are a very small fraction of
revenues for the largest firms. Finally, we allow the merger to generate productivity spillovers
between the merged entities. Specifically, we allow for the less-productive product line to
inherit some of the efficiency of the most productive one, with the strength of the spillover
40

Note that in our model with a continuum of sectors, we need to consider a positive measure of sectors with
a policy change, since changes in a single sector have no aggregate effects. The direct effect of a policy change
in sector z can be captured by (dΠz + dT Rz )/Y − αz d log Pz , but the indirect general equilibrium effects have
impact on all other sectors z 0 ∈ [0, 1] and need to be taken into account.
41
With this definition, in the limit as sets Z become tight around individual sectors z, the aggregate welfare
change Ŵ from a sectoral policy vector {ςz }z∈[0,1] can be decomposed as a cross-sectoral weighted-average of
R1
the welfare effects Ŵz of the sectoral policies ςz , namely Ŵ = 0 αz Ŵz dz.
42
Given CES demand, the optimal markups are the same for both products and depend on their cumulative
market share s0z,1 + s0z,2 in the new equilibrium, according to the same functional relationship as in (7).

34

governed by the parameter % ∈ [0, 1]:
ϕ0z,2 = %ϕz,1 + (1 − %)ϕz,2 ,
where ϕz,i is the productivity of the pre-merger firm i and ϕ0z,i is the productivity of the corresponding post-merger product line. Given this post-merger market structure and productivity
distribution, we solve for the new entry game and price-setting equilibrium in each sector. To
get at the full welfare effect of a merger, we simulate it for a subset of sectors z ∈ Z, and recompute the new general equilibrium. This allows us to quantify and decompose the average
general equilibrium welfare effect of a merger, ŴZ , as described above.
To illustrate our findings, we report in Figure 6 the welfare effects of a merger in a baseline experiment in which the productivity spillover is set at a high value of % = 0.5, and the
Appendix Figure A8 provides the results for an alternative low level of productivity spillover
% = 0.1. The figure plots the welfare implication of a top merger, as a function of the level
of granularity of the sector captured by the granular trade share Γ∗z , and for different levels of
trade openness captured by the variable trade cost τ . A stark picture emerges. First, mergers
are much less welfare detrimental, and instead can increase domestic welfare, when the economy is more open to international trade, even if the productivity spillover % is small. Second,
when the productivity spillover is sufficiently strong or if the economy is sufficiently open,
mergers are particularly beneficial in the most granular sectors.43 This interaction between
granularity and trade openness is driven by the fact that the merged entity enjoys increased
market power and greater profits. The more open the economy, the more these profits are
made at the expense of the foreign country, by extracting its consumer surplus and improving
the terms of trade for the home country.
The right panel of Figure 6 dissects the overall welfare effect of a merger into the contributions from consumer and producer surplus, −d log P and dΠ/Y . First, note that a merger,
by increasing monopoly power, leads the price level to increase and hence the real wage to
decline, reducing consumer surplus. Even a substantial productivity spillover (% = 0.5) cannot make up for the deterioration in industry competitiveness coming from an increase in
markups. This decline in consumer surplus is counterbalanced by an increase in producer surplus, i.e. by the profits of domestic firms, at home and abroad. In sufficiently open economies
and granular sectors, this increase in producer surplus dominates the reduction in consumer
surplus, resulting in a net increase in domestic welfare.44
43

With a high level of productivity spillover (% = 0.5), mergers are detrimental to welfare only in sectors
with little granularity and when the economy is closed to international trade. With low productivity spillovers
(% = 0.1), mergers are only beneficial when the economy is very open to international trade and in the most
granular sectors. Compare Figures 6 and A8.
44
The loss of consumer surplus may be lower or higher in more granular sectors, depending on the strength

Note: The figure plots the average welfare effects ŴZ of a merger between the first two firms in an industry with
a high productivity spillover % = 0.5 (see description in the text), where sets Z are quintiles of sectors by granular
export share Γ∗z . The left panel plots the overall average welfare effects ŴZ in economies with different levels of
trade costs τ (estimated baseline τ = 1.34, free trade τ = 1, and double the baseline τ = 2.68 corresponding to
a high 168% trade cost). The right panel plots the decomposition of the overall effect ŴZ into the contributions
from consumer and producer surplus, following (22), for the baseline level of trade cost τ = 1.34 (the blue circled
lines are the same in the two panels). Appendix Figure A8 reports the alternative case with low spillover % = 0.1.

This analysis suggests a rationale for governments in open countries to be more lenient
towards mergers, especially in more granular industries. Of course, mergers that are beneficial
from the perspective of the home economy can be detrimental for foreign welfare, as they lead
to a deterioration in foreign terms of trade. A lenient antitrust policy can, thus, substitute for
a beggar-thy-neighbor trade policy. This suggests an important role for international cooperation over M&A policies in open economies to avoid excessive build-up of market power.

6.2

Granular import tariff

The second policy we consider is a granular import tariff ςz,1 imposed on the largest foreign
exporter. Narrow trade restrictions and antidumping duties that target individual firms have
been regularly emphasized in the policy debate. We contrast this granular tariff with a uniform
import tariff ς¯z in the same industry that generates the same tariff revenue.45 The government
may consider a granular tariff over a sectoral one for two reasons. First, it might be more
of productivity spillovers %, which leads to greater efficiency gain in more granular sectors (cf Figures 6 and A8).
The gain in producer surplus is larger in more granular sectors, conditional on fundamental productivity Φ∗z (note
that a single sort on Γ∗z in the figures induces a negative selection on Φ∗z , explaining the slight non-monotonicity).
45
In particular, we set ς¯z as a uniform 1% tariff on all imports, and then search for the value of ςz,1 on the top
foreign firm, which yields the same tariff revenue at the industry level. See Appendix B.2 for full modeling details.

Note: GE average welfare effects ŴZ (and their decomposition according to (22)) of a 1% uniform import tariff ς¯z
and a corresponding granular tariff on the top foreign exporter ςz,1 ≥ ς¯z , which yields the same tariff revenue
(hence, yellow-triangled lines coincide in the two subplots, providing a benchmark for comparison). Subsets Z
correspond to quintiles of sectors sorted by foreign granularity Γz . Tariff revenue is T R/Y , the change in the
producer surplus is dΠ/Y and the change in the consumer surplus is −d log P , which together add up to the
overall welfare change ŴZ .

attractive in terms of domestic political economy, though perhaps more complex to impose
legally. Second, it might be a more effective policy at extracting surplus from foreign producers and improving the home country’s terms of trade. As we shall shortly see, this latter
consideration is indeed the case in our granular model with oligopolistic competition.
Figure 7 describes the general equilibrium welfare consequences of the two alternative import tariffs and its decomposition based on (22). Again, we consider the policy applied to a
subset of sectors z ∈ Z, which correspond to the quintiles of sectors, but now in terms of foreign granularity Γz . We find that home benefits from both types of import tariffs, but always
more from imposing a granular tariff, especially in sectors where foreign enjoys granular comparative advantage. While a 1% uniform import tariff leads to average welfare gains of around
0.2%, the gains from a corresponding granular tariff can be more than doubled in sectors with
outstanding foreign firms.
Turning to the decomposition of these effects, we first note that, by construction, tariff
revenues are the same under both policies. Furthermore, Figure 7 shows that the post-tariff
change in the total home firm profits is very small and nearly identical under the two alternative tariffs. Hence, the main difference between the two policies lies in the extent of consumer
surplus destruction, i.e. increase in the home price level triggered by the tariffs. A uniform
tariff has a strong negative effect on the consumer surplus, which offsets a large part of the
37

gains from tariff revenue. On net, the general equilibrium terms of trade improvement, triggered by a reduction in foreign wages, leads home to enjoy an increase in real income and
welfare, largely independently from the extent of foreign granularity of the sector.46
In contrast, a granular tariff achieves an improvement in terms of trade without destroying the surplus of home consumers. As can be seen in the right panel of Figure 7, perhaps
surprisingly, the average prices faced by the home consumers even fall slightly, a version of
the Metzler paradox (see also Helpman and Krugman 1989, Chapters 4 and 7). The reason is
that in response to a granular tariff, the large foreign exporter choses to reduce its markup
in an attempt to maintain its home market share. This incomplete pass-through of the tariff
into prices leads to a partial-equilibrium terms of trade improvement, which reinforces the
general-equilibrium one via a declining foreign wage.47 A further implication of this mechanism is that a granular tariff leads to a much smaller loss in the volume of trade, reducing
the import shares in the targeted sectors by a small percentage. This is in contrast with a
uniform import tariff, which leads to a large reduction in trade flows, as we illustrate in the
Appendix Figure A9. To conclude, this analysis suggests that a granular tariff is an effective
way of extracting surplus from foreign producers and converting it into home tariff revenues.

Conclusion

Granular firms play a pivotal role in international trade. The goal of this paper is to contribute
to our understanding of the granular features of the global economy, with a particular focus
on international trade flows, and to develop tools to analyze them. To this end, we propose
and quantify a granular multi-sector model of trade, which combines fundamental comparative advantage across sectors with granular comparative advantage embodied in outstanding
individual firms. We adopt the workhorse model of international trade with heterogeneous
firms, in which we relax the standard assumption of a continuum of firms, and hence allow
individual firms to shape aggregate trade patterns. The model, estimated using a rich set of
sectoral and firm-level moments, suggests that granularity account for about 20% of the variation in realized export intensity across sectors. Moreover, granularity contributes markedly
to skewness in aggregate outcomes, as it is most pronounced in the most export-intensive sectors. As a consequence, idiosyncratic firm dynamics accounts for a large share of the evolution
of a country’s comparative advantage over time, as well as its mean reversion across sectors.
46

Since foreign granular residual Γz correlates positively with home import share Λz = Φz +Γz , a 1% uniform
import tariff results in greater tariff revenues, but also in larger loss in consumer surplus, in bins of sectors with
high Γz . These two opposing effects net out, leaving the overall welfare effect of a uniform tariff rather stable.
47
The pass-through is more complete for a uniform tariff for two reasons: (a) it constitutes a more aggregate
shock, affecting a larger number of firms, and (b) smaller firms exhibit larger cost pass-through (in the model, as
well as in the data; see Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings 2018).

38

The granular structure of the world economy offers powerful incentives for governments to
adopt trade and industrial policies targeted at individual firms.
By relying on the conventional modeling assumption of exogenous productivity draws,
our model abstracts from an important question, the one of the origins of outstanding firms.
We see this line of analysis as very fruitful for future research. In particular, it would help better understand whether government policies can and should promote the growth of “national
champions”. Another mechanism we assume away in this paper are productivity spillovers
between independent firms. Such spillovers may be important in practice, especially for firms
that are located close together, as the literature on agglomeration economies suggests. Analyzing the role of granular firms and their location decisions in determining the productivity
and growth trajectories of individual cities (e.g., the decisions of Microsoft to move from Albuquerque to Seattle in 1979) is another fascinating question that we leave for future research.

Figure A7: Trade effects of individual firm exit: additional patterns
Note: The left plot is the same as Figure 5 in the main text, but done for all sectors, and not just for the top
30% of sectors in terms of export intensity Λ∗z . In this case, there is a non-monotonic pattern across deciles
of Γ∗z because of the strong selection effect for the very bottom deciles of Γ∗z (as they must be very high Φ∗z
sectors since Λ∗z = Φ∗z + Γ∗z ≥ 0 by construction). The right panel is the same as the left panel, but deciles are
sorted by the overall initial export intensity of the sectors Λ∗z . Bottom deciles by Λ∗z are low on both Φ∗z and Γ∗z ,
and hence the destroyed market share of the top home firm is fully captured by foreign firms.

observable variables (and a constant). M̃z is the number of French firms in the French market, s̃z,1 is the relative
size of the largest French firm in the French market relative to other French firms, and s̃∗z,1 is a corresponding
variable for foreign firms. Projections are done using 10,000 counterfactual sectors drawn from the estimated
model, and thus standard errors on the projection coefficients are nearly zero. The partial correlations of Γ∗z
with log(αz Y ) and Φ∗z are close to zero, and we omit these results for brevity (compare the incremental R2 in
columns 2–4 and 5–6). We have also experimented with two other proxies for granularity — concentration ratio
of the three largest domestic firms (relative to other domestic firms) and the ratio of the top to median market
shares of the domestic firms; both of these variables have similar, albeit slightly lower, explanatory power as s̃z,1 ,
but they do not improve the fit when combined together.

Continuous DFS-Melitz model

We review here the continuous model, which serves as a benchmark in our granular analysis. Consider a two-country multi-sector extension of the Melitz (2003) model, with Ricardian
comparative advantage across a unit continuum of sectors indexed by z ∈ [0, 1], as in Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977).48 We refer to this benchmark economy as DFS-Melitz.
More specifically, within each sector z we consider the Chaney (2008) version of the Melitz
model without free entry, in which an exogenous mass of firms M̄z are present and their productivities are drawn from a Pareto distribution with a sector-specific lower bound ϕz and a
shape parameter θ common across all sectors. We show below that in this model, the overall
sectoral productivity is determined by Tz = M̄z · ϕθz , as in (6). The two countries differ in the
sectoral productivity measures, {Tz } at home and {Tz∗ } in foreign, which is the source of the
Ricardian comparative advantage across sectors.
Housebolds are as described in Section 2 with the exception that, instead of (2), the sectoral
CES consumption bundles aggregate over a continuum of individual varieties ω:

where Ωz is the set of varieties available for consumption in sector z at home, and the resulting
1/(1−σ)
R
. The foreign demand structure is symmetric,
price index is Pz = ω∈Ωz pz (ω)1−σ dω
∗
with Ωz replacing Ωz .
Firms and productivity are also as described in Section 2, with the exception that M̄z is
a deterministic mass of existing shadow firms in each sector, with individual productivities
ϕz (ω) ∼ iid Pareto(θ, ϕz ) with P{ϕz (ω) ≤ ϕ} = 1 − (ϕz /ϕ)θ representing the realized
productivity frequencies. A continuous model requires a parameter restriction θ > σ − 1.
Each firm is infinitesimal in the markets it serves. Therefore, upon entry, firms compete
according to monopolistic competition in each market. They set a constant markup σ/(σ − 1)
over their marginal costs. This implies that the firm’s operating profit in each market equals
1/σ of its revenues, and the overall profit of the firm can be written as:

This model extends Melitz (2003) in a multi-sector way, the same way Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer
(2012) extend the Eaton and Kortum (2002) model. Other papers which considered a multi-sector DFS-Melitz
environment, albeit under somewhat different formulation, are Okubo (2009) and Fan, Lai, and Qi (2015).

where we substituted the markup pricing rule over the marginal cost into the expression for
revenues (3), and we use the notation [x]+ ≡ max{0, x}.49 Firms with sufficiently high productivities profitably enter the home and the foreign markets respectively, as is conventional
in the Melitz model. We denote with ϕh,z and ϕf,z the productivity cutoffs for a domestic firm
to enter the home and foreign markets respectively in sector z, and rewrite profits as:

The foreign firms are symmetric, and we denote with πz∗ (ω) their profits, and with ϕ∗h,z and
ϕ∗f,z their productivity cutoffs for entry into the home and foreign markets respectively.
Sectoral equilibrium Using the definition of the price index, the markup pricing rules, the
cutoff definitions in (A2), and the Pareto productivity distribution, we can integrate to solve
for the price index in sector z in the home market:

where κ ≡ θ/(σ − 1) and Φz is the foreign share, as defined in (13).50 The sectoral price index
in (A3) increases in the local wage rate and in the relative fixed cost of entry (wF )/(αz Y ), and
decreases in sectoral productivity Tz and in the foreign share Φz , which reflects the gains from
trade (see ACR). Using (A3), we can express all sectoral variables as functions of the general
equilibrium vector (w, w∗ , Y, Y ∗ ) and exogenous parameters of the model, completing the
description of the sectoral equilibrium.
The definition of the foreign share Φz , and its symmetric counterpart in the foreign country Φ∗z , makes it straightforward to calculate sectoral exports of home and foreign countries
respectively:
Xz = αz Φ∗z Y ∗
and
Xz∗ = αz Φz Y,
(A4)
and sectoral net exports is N Xz = Xz − Xz∗ . In addition, we also characterize the allocation
49

Specifically, a home firm sets pz (ω) =

in the home market, which results in revenues

(pz (ω)/P (z))
αz Y , according to (3), and the operating profits equal fraction 1/σ of these revenues due to
constant markup pricing. Net profits are operating profits net of the fixed entry cost. Symmetric characterization
applies to profits in the foreign market, with the difference that the marginal cost of delivering a good abroad is
augmented by iceberg trade cost τ .
50
We note that the foreign share in (12) does not depend on the fixed costs since both domestic and foreign
firms are assumed to face the same fixed costs of entry into the home market. As a result, fixed costs in this
framework have little effect on the key variables which characterize equilibrium, apart from the price indexes Pz
and Pz∗ , which increase with the fixed cost of entry into the market, thereby reducing local welfare.

The last term is labor used in production of goods for foreign market, while the first two terms
are labor used for production and entry costs in the home market.51 Combining (A4) and (A5),
with (A8) below, we obtain the relationship between sectoral net exports and labor allocation:

(A6)

In autarky, Lz = αz L due to the Cobb-Douglas preferences, yet in the open economy labor
reallocates towards the sectors with comparative advantage.
General equilibrium requires balanced current account and labor market clearing in both
countries, which (together with our choice of numeraire w∗ = 1) allow us to solve for (w, w∗ , Y, Y ∗ ).
These three conditions also imply countries’ budget balances (9) by Walras Law.
Balanced current account can, in general, be different from the balanced trade in this model,
as exporting requires paying a fixed cost in the destination market. Nonetheless, the two
coincide in the continuous model with a Pareto distribution. The total home income obtain
from exports in sector z equals the value of exports Xz = αz Φ∗z Y ∗ net of the fixed cost of
α Φ∗ Y ∗ , which is proportional to exports Xz = αz Φ∗z Y ∗ ,

(A8)

Therefore, total labor income is a constant share of GDP (total income), with the complementary share coming from firm profits. Combining (A7) with (A8) and normalizing w = 1, allows
to solve for (w∗ , Y, Y ∗ ), completing the description of the general equilibrium.52

Taking the ratio of the two equations in (A8), we have Y /Y = (wL)/(w L ), which together with (A7)
allows to solve for both relative wage w/w∗ and relative incomes Y /Y ∗ , as in the DFS model. Recall from (12),
that Φz and Φ∗z can be written as function of relative wages w/w∗ and the exogenous parameters of the model.

The continuous DFS-Melitz benchmark admits as a limiting case the classical DFS
formulation when within-sector firm heterogeneity collapses. Specifically, the DFS model
emerges as a limit of the DFS-Melitz model when θ, σ → ∞, F → 0, while at the same time
1/θ
holding constant κ = θ/(σ − 1), σF and the following productivity parameters: az ≡ Tz
and a∗z ≡ (Tz∗ )1/θ . In the DFS limit, the foreign shares Φz and Φ∗z in (12) become step functions, defined by two cutoffs z, z̄ ∈ [0, 1]. Specifically, we rank all sectors z ∈ [0, 1] such
that az /a∗z = (Tz /Tz∗ )1/θ is a monotonically increasing function of z, and define the cutoffs to
satisfy:

which implies z < z̄. For sectors z ∈ [0, z), foreign is the only supplier of the good on both
domestic and foreign markets, goods z ∈ (z, z̄) are non-traded and produced in both countries,
and for goods z ∈ (z̄, 1] home is the only world supplier.
Lastly, we discuss how the granular model of Section 2 admits the continuous DFS-Melitz limit described above. We introduce a scaler M > 0, and rewrite the price
index in (7) and the market share in (3) as follows:

i=1 s̃z,i = 1 for any M > 0. We also rewrite the utility in (2) as Q̃z = M
where q̃z,i = M qz,i are the new consumption units. Lastly, the derived productivity parameter
z
· ϕθz .
in (6) is generalized as Tz = M̄
M
With this generalization to an arbitrary M > 0, we can now take the following limit:
M, M̄z → ∞ and F → 0, such that M̄z /M = const for all z and M F = const, and holding
constant the other parameters of the model, including the location of the productivity distribution ϕz . This keeps Tz unchanged. Furthermore, M̄z /M now represents the relative measure
of shadow firms in sector z. The ratio Kz /M̄z tends to a constant related to productivity cutoffs (A2) in the continuous model; the price index Pz tends to a constant, the price level in the
continuous model (A3); the market shares sz,i → 0 so that the elasticity in (7) εz,i → σ and
markups become constant equal to σ/(σ − 1); and the non-negativity of profits in (8) with
F → 0 at the same rate as sz,i → 0 now corresponds to the cutoff condition in (A2). All
sums (redefined to feature 1/M or sz,i weights) converge to corresponding integrals in the
continuous model, which is the direct counterpart to the granular model of Section 2.

Derivations and proofs for the granular model

Foreign share

Consider the foreign share Λz defined in (12). We reproduce
Λz =

XKz
i=1

(1 − ιz,i )sz,i ,

where ιz,i is an indicator for whether the firm is of home origin. There is no analytical characterization for the distribution of sz,i , which are complex transformation of the realized productivity vector, which relies both on the price setting and entry outcomes (e.g., see (3), (7) and (8)).
Nonetheless, following EKS, we can prove that the conditional distributions of sz,i |ιz,i = 1 and
sz,i |ιz,i = 0 are the same, i.e. the distribution of sz,i is symmetric for firms of home and foreign
origin, and hence the expectation of Λz simply equals the unconditional expectation that any
entrant is of foreign origin (i.e., the relative extensive margin of entry into the home market).
The formal argument proceeds in two steps (all expectations ET {·} are conditional on the
realization of fundamental productivity Tz and Tz∗ , which are hence treated as parameters):
θ

Tz w
1. For any s > 0, ET {ιz,i |sz,i > s} = PT {ιz,i = 1|sz,i > s} = Tz wθ +T
∗
∗ θ = 1 − Φz , as
z (τ w )
defined in (13). Hence, ET {ιz,i |sz,i > s} does not depend on s, and ET {ιz,i |sz,i } = ET ιz,i .
See a sketch of a proof below.

PKz

2. ET Λz = K
i=1 ET sz,i = Φz ,
i=1 ET {sz,i ·ET {1−ιz,i |sz,i }} = Φz
i=1 ET {(1−ιz,i )sz,i } =
 PKz
since ET
i=1 sz,i = ET {1} = 1, and where the third equality uses property 1.
Property 1 follow from the Poisson-Pareto productivity draw structure and the application
of the Bayes’ formula. Indeed, in a given sectoral equilibrium, sz,i decreases with the cost
of the firm cz,i , which in turn decreases with the firm productivity (ϕz,i if the firm is home
and ϕ∗z,i if the firm is foreign; see (5)). Given the productivity draw structure, the number of
home firms with productivity above ϕ is a Poisson random variable with parameter ϕ−θ Tz ,
and symmetrically for the foreign firms. Consequently, the number of home and foreign firms
with a cost below c are independent Poisson random variables with parameters (w/c)−θ Tz and
(τ w∗ /c)−θ Tz∗ , respectively. Therefore, we can calculate:
PT {ιz,i = 1|sz,i > s} = PT {ιz,i = 1|cz,i < c}
(w/c)−θ Tz
PT {cz,i < c, ιz,i = 1}
=
= 1 − Φz .
(w/c)−θ Tz + (τ w∗ /c)−θ Tz∗
ι∈{0,1} PT {cz,i < c, ιz,i = ι}

=P

Therefore, we conclude that indeed ET Λz = Φz , and the granular residual Γz = Λz − Φz is
zero in expectation for any sector z (see (13) and (14)).

We reproduce here the full general equilibrium system of the granular
model, which consists of the aggregate budget constraints and labor market clearing in both
countries. Using (8) and (10), we write the home country budget Y = wL + Π constraint as:

where K ∗ = KH

It is immediate to verify that the equilibrium system (A10)–(A13) has the following properties:

1. It is linear in the general equilibrium vector (w, w∗ , Y, Y ∗ ) conditional on the vector

(Λ, Λ∗ , KH , KH

z∈[0,1]

2. It is linearly dependent, so that any of the four equations follow from the other three.
Normalizing w = 1 and dropping any of the equations (for example (A11)) results in
a linearly independent system of three equations in three unknown (w∗ , Y, Y ∗ ) with a
unique solution.
3. Substituting in labor market clearing (A12) into the budget constraint (A10) (or equivalently (A13) into (A11)) results in the current account balance condition (which in general differs from the trade balance N X = Λ∗ Y ∗ − ΛY ):
∗
ΛY − wF KF = Y ∗ Λ∗ − w∗ F ∗ KH
.

(A14)

The equilibrium system can be represented by system of three linearly independent
equations (A12)–(A14). Note the similarity and differences of this equilibrium system
with a corresponding system in the continuous model (A7)–(A8). In particular, due to
discreteness and variable markups, the shares of labor income and profits in aggregate
income are no longer constants (σκ − 1)/(σκ) and 1/(σκ).
Finally, using the same strategy we used to prove that ET Λz = Φz above, we can show that

where the integrals of Φz and Φ∗z can be viewed as expectations taken over the joint distribution
of (αz , Tz /Tz∗ ). As αz and Tz /Tz∗ are assumed independent, the values of Φ and Φ∗ depend
only on the parameters θ, τ and (µT , σT ) of the distribution of Tz /Tz∗ . Using this result, we can
simplify the equilibrium system. For example, conditions (A10) and (A14) can be rewritten as:

which corresponds to the expression in footnote 16. Lastly, note that in a closed economy
Φ = Φ∗ = 0, and therefore the country budget constraint (A10) becomes Y = µ̄w[L − F K],
as we have it in footnote 13.
Consider firm-specific tariffs {ςz,i } imposed by the home government on
foreign firms i in sector z. In particular, if a foreign firm generates revenues rz,i = sz,i αz Y in
the home market, it needs to pay ςz,i rz,i to the home government, and takes home (1 − ςz,i )rz,i .
Then the foreign firm’s profit maximization in the home market is:

with the solution for prices and markups as if its costs were increased to c0z,i = cz,i /(1 − ςz,i ),
or equivalently productivity draw reduced to ϕ0z,i = ϕz,i (1 − ςz,i ). We denote the resulting

and ranking firms on c0z,i (and hence s0z,i does not guarantee monotonic-

F/(1 − ςz,i ) ≈ F is sufficient accurate in the entry game. Indeed, recall that entry is a discrete zero-one decision,
in which most entering firms are inframarginal, with Π0z,i  0 due to the Zipf’s law.

Therefore, there are changes to the three general equilibrium conditions (A10), (A11) and
(A13). In particular, (A10) becomes:

and where the profits of home firms Π is still expressed as in (A10). Foreign income (A11) is

Lastly, the current account balance (A14) becomes:

ΛY − wF KF − T R = Y ∗ Λ∗ − w∗ F ∗ KH
,

as now the foreign income from exporting is reduced by T R.
In an open granular economy, idiosyncratic firm productivity shocks affect sectoral comparative advantage and hence the allocation of production and employment
across sectors.54 We calculate the share of the total labor reallocation across firms (T LR)
accounted for by the reallocation of labor across sectors (SLR). Formally, we define:

where ∆Lz,i,t is the annual employment change of firm i in sector z and ∆Lz,t is the annual
employment change in sector z, and | · | takes the absolute values of these changes.55 By construction 0 ≤ SLR ≤ T LR ≤ 1. T LR captures the overall extent of labor reallocation across
firms in the economy and SLR captures the extent of the inter-sectoral labor reallocation.
We report SLR, T LR and SLR/T LR in Appendix Table A2, for both annual and 10-year
employment changes, and for different counterfactual values of trade openness.
54
In contrast, in a continuous model, sectoral labor allocation is given by (A6), and just like trade patterns is
not sensitive to idiosyncratic firm productivity shocks.

SLR corresponds to the net employment change and T LR corresponds to the average of job creation and job

Estimation Appendix

Detailed estimation procedure:

1. For given parameter values of µT and σT , we draw N relative sectoral productivities Tz
from the log-normal distribution (recall our normalization Tz∗ ≡ 1).56 We keep the seed
of all random draws constant throughout estimation.
2. For given values of parameter θ and realization of Tz in each sector z = 1..N , we draw
z
productivities of potential entrants {ϕz,j }M
j=1 in a manner consistent with the distribuMz∗
tional assumptions of the model.57 We obtain foreign productivity draws {ϕ∗z,j }j=1
in
the same manner.
3. With the calibrated value of the relative wage rate w/w∗ and normalization w = 1,
and given the productivity draws and the remaining model parameters (σ, τ, F ), we
implement the following fixed point procedure:
(i) Take an initial guess for (Y, Y ∗ ), which completes the general equilibrium vector
X = (w, w∗ , Y, Y ∗ ) .
(ii) Given X, solve for sectoral equilibrium in each sector and each country, charac
∗
∗ Kz

∗
z
terizing Z ≡ Kz , {sz,i }K
i=1 , Kz , {sz,i }i=1 , as described in Section 2.
(iii) Given Z and the normalization L = 100, use the general equilibrium conditions (9)
and (11) to solve for the new values of Y and Y ∗ . Note that these equations are
56

We use four replications of the French sectors. The simulated economy has therefore N = 476 (= 119 × 4)
sectors in total. Without such replication, the model is sensitive to the randomness in the match between sectoral
shares αz and productivities Tz , while with four replications the effect of this randomness is already negligible.
In each of the four replications, the empirical Cobb-Douglas shares and reshuffled randomly across sectors.
57
Specifically, we follow EKS in using rank-order statistics for the Poisson-Pareto data generating process to
directly draw the productivity of the most productive firm, which follows a Frechet(θ, Tz ) distribution, and each
firm thereafter, with spacings following an exponential distribution. Specifically, denote Uz,j ≡ Tz ϕ−θ
z,j , where
j is the rank of domestic firms in industry z. Eaton and Kortum (2010) show that Uz,1 , (Uz,2 − Uz,1 ), (Uz,3 −
Uz,2 ), . . . are iid exponential with cdf GU (u) = 1 − e−u . We use the transformation to convert the exponential
draws into productivity draws {ϕz,j }. We draw enough shadow firms in each sector to ensure that the least
productive ones never enter the market. Specifically, we use 5,000 firm draws by sector for France and 10,000 for
ROW. For smaller sectors (in terms of Cobb-Douglas shares), we use 700 and 1,400 draws respectively, to reduce
computing time. We check that with these number of draws, and over the relevant range of parameter values
used in estimation, it is never the case that all shadow firms enter in any of the sectors.
58
Solving for exact equilibrium values of Kz and Kz∗ is computationally costly, therefore, we adopt the following approximation procedure. We solve for equilibrium K̂z under the counterfactual assumption of constant
markup equal to µ̂ = σ/(σ − 1), which is a simple analytical problem. It is easy to show that K̂z is a lower bound
for equilibrium Kz with variable markups (since from (7) equilibrium markups are strictly higher than µ̂, and
hence price level is higher, yielding room for additional entry). We solve for oligopolistic equilibrium markups
and market shares given K̂z . Given these markups for the first K̂z firms, we then solve for additional entry
∆Kz , assuming the marginal entrants charge constant markup µ̂. We then set Kz = K̂z + ∆Kz , and recalculate
the oligopolistic equilibrium markups and market shares for this Kz . We check numerically that this procedure
recovers a Kz which differs from the exact solution by at most one or two firms. Given that a typical French
sector has over 300 firms, we view this approximation error as small.

linear in (Y, Y ∗ ), and hence this is done by simple inversion.
(iv) Update the initial values of (Y, Y ∗ ) taking a half step between the initial vector
from step (i) and the new vector from step (iii), and loop over until convergence.
Upon convergence of (Y, Y ∗ ), we use the foreign counterpart to labor market clearing condition (11) (namely, (A13)) to recover the value of L∗ , which is consistent
with the general equilibrium relative wage w/w∗ , given parameter vector Θ.
(v) Upon convergence of the equilibrium vector (X, Z), simulate the model and calculate the moment vector Mz (Θ) for all sectors z = 1..N , corresponding to parameter vector Θ = (σ, θ, τ, F, µT , σT ).
4. On a grid for parameters Θ with 20,000 points, evaluate the moment function Mz (Θ),
with moments described in Table 2, and the associated SMM loss function:

2
0
L(Θ) ≡ M̄(Θ) − m̃ W M̄(Θ) − m̃ = w0 M̄(Θ) − m̃ ,
P
where M̄(Θ) ≡ N1 N
z=1 Mz (Θ), m̃ are the values of the moments in our empirical
dataset Ξ̃, and W = diag{w} is the weighting matrix, which we chose to be diagonal
and inversely proportional to m̃2 .59 Table 2 also reports the relative contribution of
each moment k to the overall loss function, which with a diagonal weighting matrix is
2
straightforward to calculate as wk M̄k (Θ̂) − m̃k /L(Θ̂), where subindex k refers to
the kth entry of the respective vector.
We use a Halton sequence to define the grid points, so that it covers the whole parameter
space more efficienctly than if points were regularly spaced.
5. With the results from the first Halton grid, we recompute a second finer Halton grid of
20,000 points. We restrict this grid to be wide enough to ecompass the 50 best fitting
parameter values of the previous grid, but exclude the regions with the highest loss function. We iterate this procedure five times. After five iterations, the procedure converges
to a narrow region of the parameter space.
6. We take the best 20 of all the evaluated grid points, i.e. the ones that correspond to the
lowest value of the loss function, and start local minimizers from each of them. We take
as our estimate (the global minimizer) the point of local convergence with the lowest
loss function, Θ̂ = arg minΘ L(Θ).
59

We use this weighting to express the moment fit in percentage-deviation terms, apart for the first moment
log M̃z , which is already in relative (log) terms (see Table 2 for the list of moments). For moments 14 and 15,
with empirical values close to zero, w uses the values of the symmetric moments 12 and 13. Finally, we downweight all standard deviation moments relative to the mean moments by a factor of 3, to emphasize the greater
importance of matching the average patterns relative to the patterns of variation across sectors.

57

We use the standard SMM asymptotics (as the number of sectors increases unboundedly) to calculate the standard errors for our estimator Θ̂.
Rewrite the moment conditions as Emi (Θ) = 0, where mi (Θ) = M̄(Θ) − m̃i is the moment
P
function such that Ñ1 Ñ
i=1 mi (Θ) = M̄(Θ) − m̃, where i correspond to one of Ñ sectors
we observe in the data. With this, we express our SMM estimator Θ̂ minimizing L(Θ) as a
conventional extremum estimator:

Furthermore, note that M̄(Θ) are model-evaluated moments, which do not contribute to
the sample variation in mi (Θ).60 Thus, all sample variation emerges from the empirically
measured moments m̃i over a finite sample of Ñ sectors. This gives rise to the standard errors
of SMM estimation, which we compute according to the conventional asymptotic theory for
an extremum estimator:

bian and H = E{mi (Θ)mi (Θ) } is the variance of moments, both in population under the true
parameter vector Θ. Note that with our SMM moment structure, the effects of the data m̃ and
the model parameters Θ separate inside the moment function mi (Θ), and hence the Jacobian
J does not depend at all on the data. Hence we calculate J by numerical differentiation using
Θ̂)
the model-generated moment function M̄(Θ), evaluated around Θ = Θ̂, that is Jˆ = ∂ M̄(
.
∂Θ
The variance of moments matrix H depends on both M̄(Θ̂) and the data, and we calculate its
estimate as follows:

The standard errors for parameters in Table 2 are then calculated as s.e.(Θ̂) = diag V̂Θ /Ñ .
60

We simulate a sufficient number of sectors in the model, so that this assumption is indeed accurate.

58

We are interested in evaluating the probability that export share Λ∗z
in a given sector z, with a vector of additional observables rz , has a substantial granular component, namely Γ∗z ≥ ϑΛ∗z for some ϑ ∈ (0, 1). Using the model, with the estimated parameter
vector Θ̂, this probability can be evaluated as follows:

where g(·|Θ̂) is the probability density of (Φ∗z , Λ∗z , rz ) realizations across sectors in the estimated model, which we characterize numerically by simulating a large number of sectors
using the estimated model. Note that we integrate over possible realizations of Φ∗z = Λ∗z − Γ∗z


using Bayes’ rule, in particular that gΛ,r|Φ Λ∗z , rz |Φ∗z gΦ (Φ∗z ) = g Φ∗z , Λ∗z , rz , and where we

for the case ϑ = 1/4 and rz = s̃z,1 .
