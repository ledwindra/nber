Export Supply and Import Demand Functions:

A Production Theory Approach

ABSTRACT

In this paper we theoretically and empirically model import demand and

export supply behavior of firms for the U.S. economy from 1967-1982. A
producer theoretic approach based on duality theory is used to derive
econometric systems of producer supply and demand functions that are

consistent with profit maximizing behavior. This syste. is then empirically
l.plemented and the resulting estimates used to construct a full set of supply
and demand elasticities characterizing import demand and export supply

functions as well as domestic output supply and labor demand. These
elasticities are in turn used to derive devaluation elasticities and some
estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate that would cause the U.S.
trade surplus to reach zero.

I. Introduction

In this paper, we utilize a producer theory approach to the generation of
export supply and import demand functions for the U.S. economy for the period

1967 to 1982. Our approach uses an economy wide GNP function1 or restricted
profit function with exports appearing as outputs and imports appearing as

inputs. This approach to modeling trade functions using an integrated
production theory framework was implemented by Kohli [19781 for the Canadian
economy.2
Traditional general equilibrium models of trading economies assume that
internationally traded goods can enter the consumer sector directly and hence
traditional empirical approaches to the estimation of import demand and export

supply functions inevitably involve modeling the household sector. However,
in Kohlis approach, imports are regarded as intermediate inputs into the
production sector and exports are regarded as separate nondomestic outputs

produced by the private production sector as a whole.3 Treating imported
goods as intermediate goods seems reasonable since:

(i) many imports are

intermediates and (ii) even imported goods that are delivered to the household
sector generally have domestic transportation, wholesaling and retailing

inputs added to them. The advantage of the Kohli approach over the
traditional approach is that we need only model the private production sector
of the economy and we can ignore the difficult problems involved in modeling
the consumer sector.

Duality theory may be used to derive econometrically convenient systems
of producer supply and demand functions that are consistent with profit

maximizing behavior.4 However, often the estimated profit functions do not

2

satisfy the appropriate theoretical curvature conditions. Thus in this study,
we shall use an adaptation to the profit function context of a functional form

due to Diewert and Wales [1985]. This functional form allows one to impse the
correct curvature conditions in a global manner without destroying the
flexibility of the functional form.

A brief outline of the paper follows. In Section 2, we outline the
production theory approach to the generation of systems of export supply and

import demand functions. In Section 3, we introduce our functional form for
the profit function and we explain how the correct curvature conditions can be

imposed. Empirical results are also presented in this section. In Section 4,

we table various elasticities based on our estimated profit function. In
Section 5, we derive some devaluation elasticities and some estimates of the
equilibrium real exchange rate by year that would drive the U.S. merchandise

trade surplus or deficit to zero for the years 1967 to 1982. For example, for
the year 1982, we estimate that a devaluation of 28% would be required to

eliminate the U.S. balance of trade deficit for that year. Section 6
concludes and our data are described and tabled in a data Appendix.
Our model of producer behavior is based on short run competitive profit

maximization, holding capital fixed in each period. Thus we do not model the
capital accumulation process.

Moreover, we assume that producers regard wage

rates as fixed and can hire any amount of labor at the going wage rate. Due
to the existence of substantial amounts of unemployment during the period, we
feel that this assumption is •ore realistic than the polar case where labor
input into the private production sector is held fixed and the wage rate

becomes an endogenous variable. In subsequent work, we plan to consider
alternative treatments of labor.

2. A Prod

uction The O!1 Ap2r oa ch t oEortp2l_yandIportDemandFunctions

We assume that domestic and international demand and supply decisions are

made by profit maximizing firms operating under perfect competition in all

commodity and factor markets. The firms face vectors of domestic and
international prices and a vector of domestic primary factor stocks and make

decisions about domestic and international input demand and production. The
technology is assumed to be represented by a production possibilities set,
from which a profit function can be derived.

Specifically, let the production possibilities set for the private sector

of a country in period t be a set St{(x,y,Kt)} where x=(x1

xN) is an N

dimensional vector of domestic net outputs (if x<O, then good n is an input),
y(y1,. .

.,yj)

is an M dimensional vector of net exports (if Ym<O, then good in

is an imported good that is being utilized by the private sector) and
KtEKt1,.. .,Ktj) is a nonnegative J dimensional vector of capital stocks

utilized by the private sector in period t. Let ptpt1

pt) be the

positive vector of domestic prices faced by domestic producers in period t and
let wt=(wt1... ,wtM) be the positive vector of international prices that

producers face in period t. Then we can define the country's net revenue or
restricted profit function (see Gorman [1968], McFadden [1966], or Diewert
[1974fl by:

From I1otelling's Lemma, the economy's observed net output vector x =

(xtj...,xtj)

and observed net export vector (yt1,...yt) are equal to the

vectors of derivatives of the restricted profit function with respect to the
components of Pt and wt, respectively (if the derivatives exist); i.e.,

t t ,wt,Kt)
(p

for

t=1

T,

where V is the vector differential operator. Thus Vflt(pt,wtKt) is the
vector of first order derivatives of n with respect to the components of p.
Note that these net output and input vectors are explicitly based on short run
decisions since they are conditional on fixed stock levels of certain inputs.
The extent of fixity —- and thus the flexibility of the country to act in the
short run —-

will

depend on how many stocks are held fixed (e.g., recognizing

only the fixity of capital plant and equipment, or including also labor stocks
to characterize labor hoarding, or assuming a given domestic output level
which generates the negative of a cost function).
Assuming that only capital stocks are fixed, the system of equations (2)
represents the economy's short run domestic output supply and labor (and
possibly other domestic variable input) demand functions while the system of
equations (3) contains the economy's short run export supply and import demand

functions. If we assume a functional form for fl, and append errors to (2)
and (3), then the unknown parameters which characterize flt (and therefore the

production possibilities set St by duality theory) may be econometrically
estimated from (2) and (3), given a time series of observations on xt, yt, Pt,
wt, and Kt.

The_Normalized_Quadratic Prof it Function

The approach explained in
and

the previous section for modeling export supply

import demand functions has been implemented by Kohli [1978] for Canada

using

the translog functional form. However, a problem with the translog

5

functional form is that the estimated profit function frequently fails to

satisfy the appropriate theoretical curvative conditions. A procedure due to
Jorgenson and Fraumeni [19811 (see also Jorgenson [19841) may be used to
impose the appropriate curvature conditions, but Diewert and Wales [1985] have
shown that this procedure destroys the flexibility of the translog functional

form. We therefore will implement the model described in section 2 by using a
special case of the Biquadratic Restricted Profit Function defined by Diewert

[1985;89]. For the case of only one capital good and a constant returns to
scale technology, this profit function in period t, flt(p,w,K) say, is defined
as follows:

where Kt>O denotes the quantity of capital utilized during year t, t is a

international prices respectively, a

bN+MIT

[b1

are Ni-K dimensional column vectors of unknown parameters and B

[b1] is an

N-l-i-M by N-li-K symmetric matrix of unknown parameters.

Note that the right hand side of (4) defines a unit profit function: it
defines the maximum amount of net revenue that the economy can produce, given
one unit of capital and given that all producers face the domestic prices p
and the international prices w. Note that our definition of flt has imposed a

constant returns to scale property on the technology: if we change the
capital input by the scalar )..>O, then the economy's net revenue will change by
the same proportional factor X; i.e., flt(p,w,Xkt) =

Xflt(p,w,Kt).

The function

becomes more complex, of course, if more fixed inputs are considered.

6

The profit function defined by (4) is a straightforward adaptation of the
Generalized McFadden cost function defined in Diewert and Wales L1985].
Adapting their proofs, it can be shown that the Ut defined by (4) is a

flexible functional form for a constant returns to scale technology. It can

be seen the n also is linearly homogeneous in prices, although it will be
convex in prices if and only if the symmetric matrix B is positive
semidefinite.

For our empirical work, we utilize the data for the U.S. economy for the

period 1967-1982 which was developed by Morrison and Diewert [19851. We have
two domestic goods (i.e., N=2): x1 is the quantity of domestic sales and x2
is (minus) labor input.5 We have three classes of internationally traded
goods: Yi is (minus) the quantity of import demand excluding petroleum
products, Y2 is (minus) petroleum imports, and Y3 is exports. The data are
more fully described in the data Appendix.

From (2) and (3), differentiating fl with respect to the prices
p1,p2,w1,w2,w3 yields:

(I) the domestic supply function, (ii) (minus) the

labor demand function, (iii) (minus) the nonpetroleum import demand function,
(iv) (minus) the petroleum import demand function and (v) the export supply

function for the U.S. economy in period t. We divided these net supply
functions by the capital utilized in the period (this made the assumption of
homoskedastic errors more plausible) and appended the stochastic disturbance

ut1 to equation i in period t. The resulting system of estimating equations
is given by

There are five a1, five bi and ten b1 parameters that must be estimated
given that the cross equation symmetry constraints on the b1 in equations
(5)—(9) have been imposed. To estimate this system, we first assume that the
error vectors jtE[ut11.. 11t5jT are independently distributed with a

multivariate normal distribution with zero means and covariance matrix 0. We
then were able to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates for a,b and B using
the iterative Zeliner SYSTEM command in version 5 of SHAZAM (see White [1978))

because the system is linear. RESTRICT statements were used to impose the
cross equation symmetry restrictions. The algorithm took 65 iterations to
converge. The log of the likelihood function after one iteration was 210.25
and after 65 iterations was 260.04. The equation R-squares between the

observed and predicted values were: .24,.80,.45,. 25, and .93. These R—
squares are relatively low because of our division of the quantities on the

8

left hand side of (5)-(9) by capital to eliminate trends due to the growth in

the economy. Our parameter estimates may be found in Table 1 below.
Unfortunately, this unconstrained specification resulted in a violation

of the required curvature properties for the technology. Testing for this
violation requires verifying that the matrix of second order partial
derivatives of II with respect to prices, V2zzrt(zt,Kt) is positive

semidefinite. Since the price by definition is positive and the functional
form is basically a quadratic, the convexity conditions are satisfied globally
if and if the estimated B matrix is positive semidefinite, which can be

determined by checking whether the elgenvalues are all positive. For our
estimated unconstrained model, one of these elgenvalues turned out to be
negative.

Since the estimated B matrix did not satisfy the required properties we
imposed positive semi-definiteness on B by a reparametrization due to Wiley,
Schmidt and Bramble [1973] and discussed and extended in Diewert [1985] and

Diewert and Wales [1985]. The process requires replacing the components of B
by the corresponding elements of a 4 by 4 lower triangular matrix C, where

10) B=CCT;

C

[c..];

i,j =

1,2,3,4;

c13O for j>i

Due to the symmetry restrictions imposed on the b3 parameters, this
reparameterization does not change the total number of parameters to be

estimated. However the equations become substantially more complicated since
the b1 parameters, which enter linearly in (5)—(9) given the restrictions on
the model, must be replaced by

11) b.. =

c.kc.k

for i,j=1,. .

,'

9

Using equations (10) or (11), the b1j's appearing in (5)-(9) were
replaced by these functions of the Cjj'S. and the resulting parameters ai,bj,

and C were estimated with the nonlinear regression command in SHAZAM using the
Davisdon=Fletcher—Powell algorithm which required 345 iterations to converge.
At the final stage, the log of the likelihood function was 257.8 and the
equation by equation k—squares between the observed and predicted values were:

.23, .79, .37, .25 and .91. Thus the likelihood decreased negligibly going
from the B unconstrained case to the B constrained case and there was little
loss of fit.

Once estimates for the elements of the C matrix have been found,
estimates for the elements of the B matrix can be obtained using matrix

equation (10), or, equivalently, equations (11). These estimates for the b13
parameters along with the corresponding estimates for the a1 and bjts are

reported in the last column of Table 1. Standard errors are not reported
since standard asymptotic theory is unfortunately not applicable when

parameters are subject to inequality constraints.6 As the reader can see from
Table 1, in most cases the constrained parameter estimates are of the same
sign and order of magnitude as the corresponding unconstrained case.
In the following sections, we use only the constrained estimates in order
to form a system of U.S. net domestic supply functions by differentiating our
estimated profit function with respect to domestic prices (recall (2)) and a
system of U.S. net export supply functions by differentiating with respect to
international prices (recall (3)).

10

4. Trade Elasticities

We differentiate nt(pt1,pt2,wt1,wt2,wt3,Kt) with respect to p1 and P2 to
obtain a domestic supply function xt1

flt/pj and (minus) a labor demand

function x2 t/p2. Similarly, differentiation of fl with respect to
w2, and w3 yields ytj =
function, yt2

t/w1 =

(minus) a nonpetroleum import demand

flt/w2 = (minus> a petroleum products import demand function

and yt3 t/q3 = an

export supply function.

It is of some interest to consider the various supply and demand

elasticities with respect to prices.7 In Table 2 below, we list the domestic

supply elasticities Ex1p =

(wtj/xt1).(xt1/w),

(pt1/xt1)(xt1/p1),

i=1,2, and Ex1w3 =

j=1,2,3 for alternate years. In tables 3—6 we list the

price elasticities for the labor demand, nonpetroleum import demand, petroleum
import demand and export supply functions, respectively.

From Table 2, it can be seen that in 1982, a 1% increase in the domestic
price level or the price of nonpetroleum imports would increase domestic
supply (holding capital and other prices fixed) by about .8% and .01%
respectively while a 1% increase in the wage rate, the price of exports or the
price of petroleum imports would decrease domestic supply by about .7%, .1%

and .1% respectively. It is interesting to note that the one sign change
appearing over time in these tables is for petroleum imports; until 1973 a 1%
increase in the price of petroleum imports corresponded to an increase in

domestic supply and later it caused a decrease in supply. This has important
implications about the impact of the OPEC price shocks on domestic production.
In the cost function context, two inputs are Hicks [1946] -Allen
[1938;5041 substitutes (complements) if the cross partial derivative of the
cost function with respect to the prices of the two goods is positive

11

(nonpositive). In the profit function case, we define two distinct goods to
be substitutes (complements) if the cross partial derivative of the profit

function with respect to the two prices is gative (nonnegative). Hicks
[1946;311-312] shows that in the two input case, the two inputs must be
substitutes while in the three input case, at least two pairs of inputs must

be substitutes. Hicks [1946;321] and Diewert [l974;143—1451 show more
generally that in the case of only two variable goods, the two goods must be
substitutes while in the three variable good case, at least two pairs of goods

must be substitutes. Since the elasticities in Table 2 are second order
derivatives of the profit function with respect to Pi and one of the other
prices times the other price divided by xt1, it can be seen that domestic

sales and exports are substitutes, which we might expect. Domestic sales and
labor are substitutes while sales with either of the two types of imports are
complementary pairs of goods.

From Table 3, it can be seen that in 1982, a 1% increase in the domestic
price level, the price of imports or the price of petroleum imports would
increase the demand for labor by about 1.1%, .1%, and .02% respectively, while
a 1% increase in the wage rate or in the price of exports would decrease labor

demand by about 1.2% and .1% respectively. It appears that labor is quite
highly substitutable with domestic sales, and slightly substitutable with both

nonpetroleun and petroleum imports. Labor is complementary with exports. The
relatively large own price elasticity of demand for labor means that there
would appear to be a rather high wage—unemployment tradeoff; i.e., moderation
in wage demands would lead to relatively large employment Increases.
Conversely, the small elasticity with respect to petroleum imports implies
that there is very little tradeoff between use of energy and labor in
production.

12

Turning to Table 4, in 1982 a 1% increase in the wage rate or the price
of petroleum imports would increase the demand for nonpetroleum imports by
about 1% and .09* respectively, while a 1% increase in the domestic price
level, the price of nonpetroleum imports or the price of exports would

decrease the demand for nonpetroleum imports by about .2%, .7%, and .2%. Note
that the own price elasticity of demand for nonpetroleum imports was close to
-1 for much of the period.

It can be seen that nonpetroleum imports are

substitutable with labor (as might be expected) and petroleum imports, and are

complementary with domestic sales and exports. Note that the substitutability
with labor is particularly strong.
From Table 5, in 1982 a 1% increase in the wage rate or in the price of
nonpetroleum imports would increase the demand for petroleum imports by about
.3% and .2% respectively, while a 1% increase in the domestic price level, the
price of petroleum imports or the price of exports would decrease the demand

for petroleum imports by about .25%, .6%, and .1% respectively. It can be
seen that petroleum imports are substitutable with labor and nonpetroleum

imports, and are complementary with domestic sales and exports. Note that
although all elasticities are small, the complementarity with sales is
relatively strong in the first part of the sample, decreases, and then rises
again approximately to its initial value, whereas the substitutability with
labor is larger at the beginning of the period (Ey2p2
diminishes consistently over time (Ey2p2

.414 in 1967) and

.965 in 1982). Conversely, the own

elasticity begins very small (Ey2w2 = — .182 in 1967) and increases over time,
with a noticeable jump post 1973 and a peak in 1980 of — .894 about the time of
the second OPEC shock.

Finally, turning to Table 6, we see that in 1982 a 1% increase in the
wage rate, in the price of nonpetroleum imports, in the price of petroleum

13

imports or in the price of exports would increase the supply of exports by
about .8%, .2%, .07%, and .3% respectively while a 1% increase in the price of
domestic sales (holding other prices and capital input constant as usual)

would decrease the supply of exports by about 1.4%. Thus exports are strongly
substitutable with domestic sales, are quite strongly complementary with labor

and are weakly complementary with the two classes of imports. The own price
elasticity of export supply stayed fairly constant between .32 and .375 over
the sample period.

Although these elasticities are interesting in their own right, it may be
even more important to consider their combined implications for questions that

we may ask about international trade. One very interesting question which may
be posed, for example, is how large a change in the real exchange rate would

be required to create a zero trade surplus. We turn now to an illustration of
this application of the above elasticities.

5. Devaluation_and the Balance of Trade

Let e be an exchange rate and define the balance of trade function In
period t, Bt(e), as the value of exports minus the value of imports expressed

in world prices.8 Since net export supply functions can be obtained by
differentiating the profit function with respect to the international prices

Wj

(recall

(3), Hotellings Lemma), we may define Bt(e) as follows:
t

(12)

8 (e) E

3

t t

E.1 w.n

t

t t t t t

(ep1,ep2,w1,w2,w3,K )/w.

Since e is a hypothetical real exchange rate which expresses the price of
nontraded U.S. domestic goods relative to internally traded goods, a decline

in e implies a devaluation of the U.S. dollar.9 If we define it by (4) using

14

our constrained parameter estimates, it can be seen that Bt(l) corresponds to
the estimated trade balance for the U.S. for the year t; Bt(1)>O (<0)

indicates that the estimated trade balance is a surplus (deficit). The Bt(1)
are tabled in Table 7 below.

Differentiate (12) with respect to e and evaluate the resulting
derivatives at e=1:

(13)

Bt(l) =

E1 w1E1 Pt 2nt(ptwtKt)/wP

where yt(p,w,K) is the jth net export supply function for the U.S. economy.

Since Bt(1)0 in our sample, we can convert Bt(1) into an elasticity by
multiplying it by 1/Bt(1):

Bt(l)/Bt(l) =

53

= 1 and Ey3pt1

with respect to Pj (see Tables 4, 5,

and 6 for a partial listing for these elasticities). Equations (12) and (14)
enable us to compute Bt'.
A linear approximation to Bt(e) is:

(15)

Bt(e)

Bt(l) + Bt(l)(e_l)

From (15), it can be seen that a one cent appreciation in the real exchange
rate in period t will change the balance of trade net surplus by approximately
•0l8t'(1) billions of dollars (all quantities are measured in billions of 1972

dollars and all prices are set equal to 1 in 1972). These numbers are tabled
in Table 7. It can be seen that these trade_balance impacts are all negative
as we might expect;1° a devaluation of domestic as compared to traded goods

15

always improves the U.S. balance of trade. Note that the effectiveness of a
hypothetical devaluation improves over the sample period 11: a one cent
devaluation in the late sixties would tend to improve the trade balance by
only .5 billion dollars while the same devaluation in 1981 would improve the
balance by about 4 billion dollars.

If we take the right hand side of (15) and set it equal to zero, we may

solve for an approximate qilibrium reaL exchang rate that would induce a
zero trade surplus in each year. The resulting series et may also be found in

Table 7. Note that e1982 = .72, so that an approximate 28% devaluation would
be required to eliminate the estimated 1982 trade deficit. However, in
addition to the crudeness of the approximation (15), the reader should note
that our model assumes that domestic prices are "sticky" in the short run so

that the relative price of output and labor remain unchanged. In the long
run, domestic demand conditions may alter these prices and hence our

equilibrium exchange rate may be only a short run equilibrium. In addition,
moving to an analysis of long run adjustment is much more complex because the
dynamics of investment and different capital vintages should be incorporated
in order to model lags associated with real world devaluations.
Note, finally, that the model of real exchange rate devaluation or
appreciation developed here can be adapted to yield a producer oriented theory

of purchasing power parities12: an equilibrium PPP price vector for a country
in period t could be defined to be the price vector etpt where the scalar
exchange rate et) solves the following equation:
t

t tt t t

(16) w •V fl(e p ,w ,K ) = T

where w is the vector of international prices that all countries face,
is the country's net export vector and T denotes the long run equilibrium

16

level of "transfers" (i.e., remittances abroad, net tourist expenditures
abroad, net international debt service,'3 etc.) that the production sector of
the country should make in period t.

If labor were treated as a fixed good so

that it appears in the "capital" vector Kt, and there were only one domestic

good, then the scalar etpt would be the country's equilibrium PPP. This
formulation is useful because it shows that a country's equilibrium PPP will
not generally be unity even if technology sets are identical across countries.
The equilibrium PPP depends on:

(i) the country's long run level of net

transfers T, (ii) the country's technological capabilities (i.e., the

production set St or its dual nt), (iii) the world price vector w, and (iv)
the country's endowments of labor skills, capital stocks and natural resources

that are embodied in the vector Kt. Changes in any of these variables will
generally change the country's equilibrium PPP.

6. Conclusion
We have shown how a consistent framework for simultaneously modeling a
country's domestic supply, labor demand, import demand and export supply

functions can be obtained using producer theory. We followed in the footsteps
of Kohli [1978] and others, except that we adapted to the profit function
context some of the recent work by Diewert and Wales [1985] on flexible

functional forms that satisfy curvature conditions globally. Use of the
producer—oriented framework to model export supply and import demand functions
is much simpler than traditional general equilibrium approaches since we do
not have to model the consumer side of the model and the associated

aggregation over consumers problem. However, consideration of only one
"building block" of the full general equilibrium model, as with any applied
production theory analysis, requires partial equilibrium assumptions such as

17

exogeneity of domestic prices rather than allowing these prices to be affected

by changes in international prices. Our partial equilibrium framework
requires assumptions about conditional distributions which may not be true and
thus our estimates may be subject to some simultaneous equations bias.
Additional problems and deficiencies arise from the simplifications
incorporated in our model including:

(i) a high level of aggregation, (ii)

the assumption of constant returns to scale, (iii) the assumption of price
taking behavior (in particular, possible induced changes in foreign prices are
ignored and possible monopolistic behavior is assumed away), (iv) the neglect
of natural resource stocks, (v) the use of the assumption of homogeneous
capital across time periods (in particular, we have not allowed for possible
adjustment costs involved in installing new capital equipment), and (vi)
avoidance of consideration of the various taxes, tariffs, subsidies and quotas
that impact the allocation of resources within the private production sector

of the U.S. economy. We have shown, however, that we can effectively deal
with many interesting issues within the framework of this simple model.
Although it is possible to extend the analysis to include, say, imperfect
competition and nonconstant returns to scale, these extensions cause
additional aggregation and computation problems that, at least for a first

attempt, are best avoided. Finally, it would be useful to push our data base
forward through 1985, so that we could attempt to model the very recent
experience of the U.S. economy.14

7. Data_Appendix

The data required to calculate our indexes include price and quantity
information on national output, capital and labor inputs, exports and imports.
We have developed the output, import and export data for 1968-82 from the
National Income and Product Accounts (U.S. Department of Commerce
[1981],[19821,[1983fl, and have used real capital stock data constructed by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (U.S. Department of Labor [19831) and real
labor data updated from Jorgenson and Fraumeni [19811, since these series
closely approximate our theoretically ideal indexes.

More specifically, we have calculated the value of output (ptyyt) as
gross domestic business product including tenant occupied housing output,
property taxes, and Federal subsidies to businesses, but excluding Federal,

State and Local indirect taxes and owner occupied housing. The corresponding
price index (Pt.1), was computed by cumulating the Business Gross Domestic
Product Chain Price index.

The value of merchandise exports and imports were determined by adding
the durable and nondurable export and import values, respectively, reported in

the National Accounts. Tariff revenues were added to the value of imports.
For 1967-82, value and price data for nine different types of exports and ten
types of imports were available, which were used to compute chain price
indexes.

An aggregate export price index

was calculated as a translog

(or Divisia in SHAZAM terminology) price index in the nine types of exports

and the corresponding quantity series Xt was determined implicitly. Translog
or Tornqvist indexes are defined in Diewert [19781. An aggregate nonpetroleum
import price index PtM was calculated as a translog or divisia price index in
the nine types of nonpetroleum imports and the corresponding quantity series

19

Mt was determined implicitly. The price index pt0 and the value series for
petroleum imports were taken directly from the National Accounts and the

corresponding quantity series O was determined by division.

Using the values of imports and exports, ptt pt00t and PtXXt, tax
adjusted gross domestic private business sales to domestic purchasers, or

absorption, was calculated as PlSt =

ptyt - pt)(t + pt#t + pt0t

The

corresponding price (pts) determined by cumulating the gross domestic
purchases chain price index from the National Accounts, and the constant
dollar quantity St was calculated by division.
For our labor quantity series Lt, we used the series constructed by
0. Jorgenson and B. Fraumeni, whieh is conveniently tabled by the U.S.

Department of Labor [1983;77]. Our total private labor compensation series,
ptLLt, was taken from the same publication. The price of labor, PtL, was
determined by division.15]

For our capital services quantity series Kt we used the private business
sector (excluding government enterprises) constant dollar capital serivces

input tabled by the U.S. Department of Labor [1983;77]. In order to ensure
that the value of privately produced outputs equals the value of privately
utilized inputs, we determined the price of capital services PtK residually,

i.e., K (Ptyyt —

PtLLt)/Kt.

Changing now to the notation used in the main text of our paper, we set

xESt,
w'2

pEPt5 ;
pt0; yt3

_Lt, pt2

Xt, w3

PtL

; yt1

_Mt, w1 PtM ; yt2

_0t,

The price series are tabled below in Table 8

while the quantity series are tabled in Table 9.

Finally, we calculated a translog price index using P1 w1, w2, w3 as
prices and xtj, yt1, yt2, yt3 as the corresponding quantity weights. Call the
resulting price and net output series PAt and QAt. We calculated a translog

20

quantity index using Kt and Lt as quantities and PtK and ptL as the

corresponding price weights. Call the resulting input quantity and price
series QBt and PBt. We took t to be QAt/QBt, a translog productivity index.
For a theoretical justification of this index, see Theorem 1 in Diewert and

Morrison [1986]. The series t may be found in Table 9 below.

FOOTNOTES

1This concept can be traced to Samuelson [1953].

2See Woodland [1982; 3690375] for a summary of Kohli's approach and references
to related empirical literature. M. Denny and D. Burgess used this approach
in their unpublished Ph.D. theses; see Denny [1972] and Burgess [1974].
30f course, some of these export goods could be highly or even perfectly
substitutable with the corresponding domestic outputs.
4See Diewert [1974] [1982], Fuss and McFadden [1978] and Jorgenson [1984] for
references to the rapidly growing literature that utilizes duality theory.
5This series was taken from Jorgenson and Fraumeni [1981].

6See Gourieroux, Holly and Monfort [1982]. Replacing B by CCt is equivalent
to estimating B subject to the usual determinantal inequality conditions for
positive semidefiniteness. One of these inequalities turns out to be binding
in our case and this Is what leads to a failure in the usual asymptotic
theory.
7All supply and demand elasticities with respect to the capital input are
unity and this is due to our maintained hypothesis of constant returns to
scale. We assumed a constant returns to scale technology in order to avoid
conceptual problems that can occur when aggregating over producers.
8We ignore tariffs, subsidies and quotas in what follows.

9See Dornbusch [1980] for further discussion of the real exchange rate
concept.

101f there were only one domestic variable good, it can be shown using the
properties of profit functions that Bt'(l) must be nonpositive; see Diewert
[1974;145].

-This reflects the fact that the trade elasticities tabled in the previous
section tend to become larger in magnitude over the sample period.
2See Dornbusch [1985] for a nice exposition of purchasing power parity
theories.

13Net capital movements abroad should be excluded.

14The main obstacle to accomplishing this task is the unavailability of a
sensible measure for U.S. real labor input into the private production sector.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics [1983] for historical reasons uses unweighted
manhours as its official measure of labor input. The conceptually more
desirable wage rate weighted series developed by Jorgenson and Fraumeni [1981]
which we utilized is only available through 1982.
15We wish to thank Mike Harper at BLS and Barbara Fraumeni for their help in
providing updated series.
