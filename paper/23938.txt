Ranking Firms Using Revealed Preference
Isaac Sorkin
NBER Working Paper No. 23938
October 2017
JEL No. E24,J01,J3,J32,J42
ABSTRACT
This paper estimates workers' preferences for firms by studying the structure of employer-to-employer
transitions in U.S. administrative data. The paper uses a tool from numerical linear algebra to measure
the central tendency of worker flows, which is closely related to the ranking of firms revealed by workers'
choices. There is evidence for compensating differential when workers systematically move to lower-paying
firms in a way that cannot be accounted for by layoffs or differences in recruiting intensity. The estimates
suggest that compensating differentials account for over half of the firm component of the variance
of earnings.

Dating back to at least Smith (1776/2003, Book 1, Chapter 10) (see also Rosen (1986)),
economists have argued that differences in the nonpay characteristics of jobs explain some of earnings inequality. To find evidence for these compensating differentials, the literature has typically
taken a bottom-up, hedonic approach. In the classic hedonic approach, the researcher considers a
cross-sectional regression of earnings on one (or a few) nonpay characteristics and interprets the
coefficient on each nonpay characteristic as the market price of that characteristic. For stark case
studies such as fatality risk or whether or not a PhD scientist has control over their research agenda,
this approach has identified compensating differentials.1 But these findings are typically viewed
as somewhat special leading to the conclusion that compensating differentials are not relevant for
understanding the structure of earnings.2
This conclusion is potentially unwarranted because the hedonic approach can lead to an incomplete picture of the importance of compensating differentials for at least two reasons. First, it
assumes that a researcher knows—and can measure—all the nonpay characteristics that workers
value. Even among the characteristics a researcher can measure, if the unobserved characteristics
are negatively correlated with the observed characteristics, then estimated prices can be biased
down. Second, it assumes that the labor market is perfectly competitive and so utility is equalized
across jobs. If there is dispersion in utility, then higher-paying jobs might also have more desirable
nonpay characteristics, also biasing estimates down.
This paper develops and implements an empirical framework to measure the role of compensating differentials that addresses these two critiques via two building blocks. First, the framework
uses a revealed preference argument. As opposed to measuring and valuing one nonpay characteristic at a time, revealed preference takes a top-down approach and relies on worker choices to tell the
researcher which bundle of characteristics they value. Second, the framework allows for differences
in utility across jobs. As opposed to assuming that the labor market is perfectly competitive, the
framework quantifies the extent of utility dispersion across jobs.
To see how these two building blocks could lead to an estimate of the role of compensating
differentials, suppose there are two firms: A and B. Suppose that the firms do not tailor their offers
to specific workers, and workers have common preferences (up to an idiosyncratic utility draw).
Suppose also that both firms are initially the same size and make the same number of offers to
workers at the other firm at random. If more workers accept A’s offer than B’s offer, then we
can infer that workers prefer firm A to firm B. If it also turns out that B is higher-paying than
A, then we infer that B offers worse nonpay characteristics than A (since workers prefer A to B
despite the lower pay). Hence, compensating differentials explains why B pays more than A.3 This

their research agenda, see Stern (2004). See Mas and Pallais (2017) for an interesting recent study of alternative
work arrangements.
2
For example, Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011, pg. 2883) survey some literature on the hedonic approach
and write that compensating differentials “does not show too much promise” in explaining earnings dispersion.
3
With exactly two firms, this idea will find that compensating differentials explains either all or none of the pay
gap. With three or more firms, however, this idea can find that it is a mix: suppose the ranking based on choices is
A then B then C, while the ranking based on pay is B then A then C. Then the A and B pay gap is compensating
differentials, while the B and C pay gap is not.

example incorporate the two building blocks as follows. It relies on revealed preference because
it uses the information in workers’ choices between A and B. And it entertains the possibility of
utility dispersion because it allows us to conclude that, from the workers’ perspective, one firm is
better.
In the data I use, rather than two firms, there are about half a million firms, which poses the
computational challenge of how to aggregate the flows in an economically interpretable way. To do
so, I develop a structural interpretation of Google’s PageRank algorithm. I begin by interpreting
the flow data as arising from binary choices between firms where workers perceive a common value
of firms and an idiosyncratic utility draw. These assumptions imply a simple recursive definition
of good: “good firms hire from other good firms and have few workers leave.” A similar recursive
definition underlies Google’s PageRank algorithm which aggregates the link structure of the web:
“good webpages are linked to by other good webpages.” Compared to billions of webpages, a
matched employer-employee dataset with a half million firms is almost “small data” and it is
computationally quite cheap to solve this recursion.
I then incorporate a few other explanations for the structure of flows besides differences in the
values of firms: differences in size, offers, and the possibility that workers were laid-off. First, a
large firm will naturally have more workers moving away from it than a small firm. I account
for this because I observe firm size. Second, a firm that makes a lot of offers will naturally have
more workers moving towards it. I account for this because I estimate the offer distribution using
information in nonemployment-to-employer flows. By jointly estimating the offer distribution and
the value of nonemployment, I allow nonemployed workers to reject offers. Finally, to identify
workers who were laid off (and so who could not choose to stay at their current employer), I use
information in what a worker’s coworkers were doing at the time of the separation. In the spirit of
the displaced worker literature (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993)), if the firm is contracting
and an unusually high share of coworkers are also separating, then a firm-level shock caused the
separations, and there is a high probability that any given worker was laidoff.
Combined, these pieces give me an estimate of the value of working at a firm, which I compare to
a measure of firm-level pay to get an estimate of the role of compensating differentials in firm-level
pay differences. There are a couple reasons to focus on firm-level pay differences. First, to focus
on the common preference, I want to aggregate over idiosyncratic factors affecting workers’ choices
and observe multiple workers facing similar choices. Aggregating to the firm level provides some
hope of doing this. Second, it lets me build on recent work emphasizing the role of firms in pay
setting in the labor market (e.g., Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (AKM), Andersson et al.
(2012), Card, Heining, and Kline (2013), Song et al. (2016), Barth et al. (2016), Card, Cardoso,
and Kline (2016), Goldschmidt and Schmieder (2017), Engbom and Moser (2017), and Abowd,
Mckinney, and Zhao (2017)).4 Hence, part of the goal of this paper is to open up the black box
of what the AKM firm effects represent by asking to what extent higher-paying firms are more
desirable firms. Specifically, I interpret the extent to which higher-paying firms are more desirable
4

In this paper, I use the word firm and employer interchangeably.

2

firms as evidence of rents, while the extent to which this is not the case as evidence of compensating
differentials. Naturally, by focusing on firm effects, I only have something to say about the portion
of the variance of earnings that is at the firm level. Through the lense of the AKM decomposition—
which decomposes pay into a firm effect, a worker effect, covariates and a residual—I leave out any
compensating differentials which would be reflected in components besides the firm effect.
Once we allow for utility dispersion, nonpay characteristics can be both compensating and augmenting and so interpreting the comparison of firm-level pay and values in terms of compensating
differentials is subtle. In the classic hedonic setting of Rosen (1986), utility is equalized across jobs
(at the margin). Hence, all variation in nonpay characteristics is offset by compensating variation
in pay. In contrast, in the presence of utility dispersion (implied by frictional models), nonpay characteristics can contribute to utility dispersion by augmenting variation in pay. Thus, for any given
nonpay characteristic it is not obvious whether it is compensating or augmenting (and this might
differ by firm). By focusing on revealed preference, I partially sidestep this ambiguity. I develop a
model of a firm’s posting decision, where firms post a compensation package consisting of both pay
and nonpay characteristics. There are two sources of firm heterogeneity: heterogeneity in desired
utility (the “Mortensen” motive), which generates augmenting variation, and heterogeneity in the
marginal cost of the provision of nonpay characteristics (the “Rosen” motive), which generates
compensating variation. I show that the variation in pay conditional on overall value maps into the
pure Rosen motive, or the part of the Rosen motive that is orthogonal to the Mortensen motive.
Hence, this comparison identifies a theoretically coherent concept of compensating differentials. In
contrast, I cannot identify the importance (or presence) of the augmenting nonpay characteristics.
I estimate the model on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics
(LEHD) dataset and develop three main findings. First, the framework finds that compensating
differentials explain about two-thirds of the variance of firm-level earnings. Aggregated, this finding
implies that compensating differentials explain at least 15% of the variance of earnings. Second, if
the estimated nonpay characteristics were removed and earnings changed to compensate workers,
then earnings inequality would decline. This reduction comes mainly from the lower tail of the
income distribution shifting up. Finally, the finding of a large role for compensating differentials
helps resolve the puzzle emphasized by Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011) that benchmark
search models cannot generate the extent of observed residual earnings inequality. Workers act as
if a large share of the variance of firm-level earnings does not reflect variation in value.
Numerous supplementary analyses build the plausibility of the results. First, I aggregate the
firm-level estimates to the sector level and the ranking of sectors is intuitively plausible, as is
the implied distribution of nonpay characteristics. For example, education has good nonpay characteristics, while many blue-collar sectors, such as mining and manufacturing, have bad nonpay
characteristics. Second, the finding of a large role for compensating differentials rests on a conservative interpretation of the underlying patterns in the data: I only interpret 40% of moves to
lower-paying firms as being explained by more desirable nonpay characteristics, with the remaining
moves explained by a combination of layoffs and negative idiosyncratic shocks. Third, the moves

3

to lower-paying firms are not offset by future earnings increases, which suggests that some nonpay
characteristic drives the move. Fourth, the basic result is robust across subgroups defined by age,
gender, worker effects, geography and industry.
Nevertheless, numerous caveats related to both the data and the framework remain. In terms
of data, I do not observe hours and so it could be that all the variation in nonpay characteristics I
estimate is hours. Such a finding would perhaps be reassuring about the validity of the framework,
but might make the results less novel. I provide some suggestive evidence that hours variation is
not the dominant source of compensating differentials by looking at sectoral-level variation in hours
and find that it explains about 15% of the sectoral compensating differentials. In addition, I have
no measures of working conditions to compare to my estimates.
In terms of caveats related to the framework, as the two firm example makes clear, it is quite
stylized. Specifically, it omits many mechanisms that have been discussed in the literature. For
example, it omits screening, systematic forms of preference heterogeneity, mobility costs, and counteroffers. Combined, the first two mechanisms rule out any sorting between workers and firms. It
is typically hard, however, to tell a story of how these simplifications lead to biased estimates. The
reason is that it is not enough that any one move be for a reason outside the model, because the
idiosyncratic utility draw allows for unmodeled reasons. Instead, it is necessary to explain how
this omission generates a systematic pattern of mobility that is towards lower-paying firms. One
example that generates an overstatement of the role of compensating differentials is if all voluntary
mobility to lower-paying firms is because workers were laid-off. Another example is if the nonemployed and the employed search from very different distributions. This difference could scramble
the values and lead to a weaker relationship between values and pay.5 In addition, noise in the
estimates of the values and pay leads to an overestimate of the role of compensating differentials,
though I present Monte Carlo evidence that such bias is quantitatively small. Going the other way,
suppose that in order to work at a high-paying firm a worker needs experience at a low-paying firm.
Then workers systematically move from low-paying to high-paying firms, but the high pay reflects
their time-varying skills and not rents.
Literature: This paper builds on a number of literatures. The idea that earnings cuts identify
nonpay characteristics is shared with a few papers (e.g., Becker (2011), Nunn (2013), Sullivan
and To (2014), Hall and Mueller (2017), and Taber and Vejlin (2016)). The most closely related
paper is Taber and Vejlin (2016), which also uses matched employer-employee data and a revealed
preference argument. Relative to this paper, Taber and Vejlin (2016) attempt to explain all of
the variance of earnings and not just the firm-level component. This ambition, however, means
that the mapping to the data is less straightforward. Relative to the remaining papers (which all
use individual level data), I focus on the firm component, which averages out idiosyncratic nonpay
aspects of job value.6
5

The actual model that would generate this is slightly more complicated, because in order to get this to be a
steady state this implies that the layoffs shocks are non-neutral with respect to worker type, and it is not obvious
how this propogates through estimation.
6
There is also literature (e.g., Gronberg and Reed (1994), Dey and Flinn (2005), Bonhomme and Jolivet (2009),

4

This paper uses how workers move across firms in a new way relative to existing literature.
Bagger and Lentz (2016) also emphasize patterns in worker reallocation across firms, but do not
allow for nonpay characteristics and do not exploit the complete structure of employer-to-employer
moves. Similarly, Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2016) and Haltiwanger et al. (2017) explore worker
flows and ask whether these are consistent with a job ladder defined by a particular observable
characteristic (e.g., size or wages). I invert the approach in these papers and instead construct the
job ladder implied by worker flows.
The estimation approach applies conditional choice probability estimation (Hotz and Miller
(1993)) to matched employer-employee data, which allows gross worker flows between firms to
exceed net flows. Other papers exploit similar modeling insights to study situations where gross
flows exceed net flows; e.g., Kline (2008) and Artuc, Chaudhuri, and McLaren (2010).
Finally, this paper echoes some themes in the interindustry wage differential literature, and I
discuss this relationship further in the concluding section.
Roadmap: This paper unfolds as follows. Section 1 introduces the data. Section 2 shows that
firms play a large role in explaining the variance of earnings, and documents some simple summary
statistics which suggest the importance of nonpay motives in driving mobility: over a third of EE
moves come with earnings cuts and about 40% of EE moves are to lower paying firms. I also
show that these EE moves to lower-paying firms reflect systematic patterns of mobility. Section 3
takes up the task of how to rank firms using mobility data. Section 4 presents the main results of
the paper. Section 5 presents the earnings inequality counterfactual and discusses the relationship
to the Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011) puzzle. Section 6 shows that the main results are
robust across a variety of subgroups. Finally, section 7 relates this paper to the interindustry wage
differential literature, and discusses some caveats and promising avenues for future work.

Matched employer-employee data

I use the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics data, which is a quarterly dataset that is constructed from unemployment insurance records.7 The LEHD is matched
employer-employee data and so allows me to follow workers across firms.
I look at the worker’s annual dominant employer: the employer from which the worker made
the most money in the calendar year. To facilitate coding transitions, I require that the worker had
two quarters of employment at the employer and that the second quarter occurred in the calender
year.8 I also restrict attention to workers aged 18-61 (inclusive) and, following Card, Heining, and
Kline (2013), require that the annualized real earnings exceed $3,250. Earnings are annualized by
adjusting earnings for the number of quarters a worker was at a particular employer. Throughout

See Abowd et al. (2009) for details.

Reduction to one observation per person per year is common. See Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999)
(France), Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney (2003) (US), Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) (Germany), and Card,
Cardoso, and Kline (2016) (Portugal). Even outside of estimating statistical wage decompositions, Bagger et al.
(2014) also reduce to one such observation per year.

5

the paper, nominal earnings are converted to 2011 dollars using the CPI-U.
To understand more about the transition, I use the quarterly detail of the LEHD to code transitions as employer-to-employer or employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer. Specifically, following
Bjelland et al. (2011) and Hyatt et al. (2014), I code a transition as employer-to-nonemployment-toemployer if between the annual dominant employers there is a quarter when the worker is nonemployed or has very low earnings. See Appendix A for details on dataset construction (including
how earnings are annualized).
Three features of the LEHD should be kept in mind when interpreting the results. First, the
unemployment insurance system measures earnings, but not hours.9 Thus, variation in hours as
well as in benefits will be included in my measure of compensating differentials. I provide some
evidence on the extent to which hours variation explains the results in section 4.4. Second, the
notion of an employer is a state-level unemployment insurance account, though the dataset follows
workers across states.10 Third, only employers that are covered by the unemployment insurance
system appear in the dataset.11 Overall, in 1994 the unemployment insurance system covered about
96% of employment and 92.5% of wages and salaries (BLS (1997, pg. 42)).
I pool data from 27 states from the fourth quarter of 2000 through the first quarter of 2008.12
Pooling data means that I keep track of flows between as well as within these states.
I impose three restrictions to eliminate the smallest firms where it would be hard to plausibly
estimate a firm effect. The first restriction is a minimum size threshold. Specifically, I eliminate
firms where there are strictly fewer than 90 non-singleton person-years at the firm (or 15 per
year), where a singleton person-year is one where I never observe the worker again.13 The second
restriction is that I look at the strongly connected subset of those firms (I define strongly connected
in section 3.2). Third, within this set of firms, I look at the strongly connected set of firms that
also hire from nonemployment, and that appear in a sufficient number of bootstrap replications.14
9
The notion of earnings captured by UI records is as follows: “gross wages and salaries, bonuses, stock options,
tips and other gratuities, and the value of meals and lodging” (BLS (1997, pg. 44)). This omits the following
components of compensation: “employer contributions to Old-age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI);
health insurance; unemployment insurance; workers’ compensation; and private pension and welfare funds” (BLS
(1997, pg. 44)).
10
This can understate firm size for two reasons. First, for employers that operate in multiple states, this understates
true employer size. Second, it is also possible for a given employer to have multiple unemployment insurance accounts
within a state, which would also lead to an understatement of true employer size, though this is quantitatively
unimportant (personal communication from Henry Hyatt (dated June 12, 2014): “the employment weighted fraction
of firmids with multiple SEINs [state employer identification number] in a given state is about 1.5%, and...this
fraction is actually lower in some of the larger states.”) That said, working conditions are probably more similar
within establishments than within employers, so having a “smaller” notion of an employer is desirable from the
perspective of measuring compensating differentials.
11
This restriction results in the exclusion of certain sectors of the economy. In particular, small nonprofit (organizations employing fewer than four workers), domestic, self-employed, some agricultural and federal government
(but not state and local government) workers are excluded. For more complete discussions, see Kornfeld and Bloom
(1999, pg. 173), BLS (1997, pg. 43) and http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/uilawcompar/
2012/coverage.pdf.
12
I use the following states: CA, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, KS, MD, ME, MN, MO, MT, NC, ND, NJ, NM, NV,
PA, OR, RI, SC, SD, TN, VA, WA, and WI. See Figure A1 in Appendix K for a map.
13
For example, all observations in 2007 count as singleton person-years because it is the last year in the dataset.
14
An additional motivation to impose a minimum size threshold is to minimize variation in the identified set of

6

Table 1 shows that the first restriction eliminates about 92% of employers, 14% of people, and 19%
of person-years, and the remaining restrictions have relatively small effects on sample size.

Earnings

I now document that conditional on person fixed effects, firms play a large role in explaining the
variance of earnings and that there are many moves to lower-paying firms. I then develop a method
to find the systematic pattern of mobility. I show that this systematic pattern also includes moves
to lower paying firms, and so these moves to lower-paying firms are unlikely to be explained by
idiosyncratic shocks.

2.1

Firms play an important role in earnings determination

To measure firm-level earnings, I use the following equation for log earnings (known as the Abowd,
Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) decomposition):
yit
|{z}

=

log earnings

αi
|{z}

person effect

+ ΨJ(i,t) + x0it β +
|{z}
| {z }
firm effect

covariates

rit
|{z}

,

(1)

residual/error term

where yit is log earnings of person i at time t, αi is a person fixed effect, ΨJ(i,t) is the firm fixed
effect at the employer j where worker i is employed at time t (denoted by J (i, t)), r is an error
term, and x is a set of covariates including higher-order polynomial terms in age.15
I quantify the role of firms in earnings using the following decomposition of the variance of
earnings:16
Var(yit )
| {z }

variance of earnings

= Cov(αi , yit ) + Cov(ΨJ(i,t) , yit )
|
{z
} |
{z
}
person effect

firm effect

+ Cov(x0it β, yit ) + Cov(rit , yit ) .

{z
}
covariates

residual

The share of the variance in earnings accounted for by firms is:
Cov(ΨJ(i,t) , yit )
.
Var(yit )

(3)

Firms play an important role in earnings determination. The third portion of Table 1 shows that
firms account for about 21% of the variance of earnings.
The fourth portion of Table 1 reports an alternative decomposition. It shows results that are
quite similar to results for an identical time period in the US using a different dataset. In particular,
firms across the bootstrap resamples.
15
Because I only use seven years of data, the linear terms in the age-wage profile are highly correlated with the
person fixed effects and thus, following Card, Heining, and Kline (2013), are omitted. Following Card, Heining, and
Kline (2013), I assume that earnings are flat at age 40, and include quadratic and cubic terms in age. See Card et al.
(2017, pg. 10) for further discussion of this point. I also include a gender dummy interacted with the type of earnings
observation used: “continuous” or “full” (see Appendix A for details).
16
Card et al. (2017, pg. 10) call this the “ensemble” decomposition.

7

relative to Song et al. (2016, Table C3, column (8)), which covers the US for 2001-2007 using Social
Security Administration data, I find a similar role of workers (51% v. 52%), a slightly larger role
for firm effects (14% vs. 12%), and a slightly larger role for the covariance of firm and worker
effects (10% vs. 7%). Putting the pieces together, I find a larger correlation between firm effects
and worker effects than Song et al. (2016, Table C2, column 8) (0.19 vs. 0.08). I also find a 6
percentage point increase in the adjusted R2 from including match effects, which is nearly identical
to that found by Song et al. (2016, Table C2, column 8).
While for finite-sample reasons it is likely that this 21% estimate is biased upwards, three
alternative approaches presented in column (1) of Table 4 suggest that this bias is negligible. First,
I shrink the firm effects using bootstrapped estimates of standard errors in a way that I describe
in more detail in section 3.3. Using the shrunken estimates, I find that firms explain 21% of the
variance of earnings. Second, I consider a sample of very large firms (1000 or more non-singleton
person-year observations per year). Using the large firm sample, I find that firms explain 20%.
Third, I split workers randomly into two mutually exclusive subsamples and estimate the AKM
decomposition in each of these subsamples. I then use the firm effects from one sample in the
AKM decomposition in the other sample. Using this approach, I find that firms explain 21% of
the variance of earnings. In combination, these three approaches suggest that the magnitude of
the bias is small and firms account for about 20% of the variance of earnings. Finally, Appendix H
discusses Monte Carlo evidence on the baseline measurement and shows that the bias is negligible.

2.2

Earnings declines are an important feature of the data

This section begins to build the empirical case that something besides the pursuit of higher pay
explains some employer-to-employer moves. I show that earnings declines are widespread, are
captured by the firm effects, and are not offset by future earnings increases.
Individual-level earnings declines are widespread in the data. Panel A of Table 2 shows that
43% of transitions between annual dominant employers see earnings declines, while 37% of such
EE transitions see earnings declines (in nominal terms these shares are naturally smaller: 40%
and 34%).17 Hence, many employer-to-employer transitions cannot be explained by pursuit of
higher-pay. By revealed preference, there must be some good nonpay characteristics that justify
these earnings cuts. The nonpay characteristics, however, might be idiosyncratic to the firm-worker
match and would not generate compensating differentials because such factors are not necessarily
priced in the labor market.
I now present evidence that the earnings declines are captured by the firm effects and then
discuss why this finding is not mechanical. To begin to show that the earnings declines are related
to firm-level characteristics that we expect to be priced in the labor market, I show that the firm
17
The share of earnings declines is quantitatively consistent with evidence from survey datasets where researchers
are able to calculate changes in hourly earnings. Jolivet, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006, Table 1) find that in the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics 23.1% of job-to-job transitions come with an earnings cut. For the Survey of Income
and Program Participation, Tjaden and Wellschmied (2014, Table 2) find 34%. And for the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth 1997, Sullivan and To (2014, Table 1) find 36%.

effects capture the probability of an earnings decline. Panel B of Table 2 shows that 52% of the
EE transitions to lower-paying firms have earnings declines, while only 27% of the such transitions
to higher-paying firms have earnings declines. Figure 1 plots the change in firm effects against
the probability of an earnings decline on all transitions (top panel) and EE transitions (bottom
panel). The probability of an earnings decline on an EE transition decreases from 75% for the
largest downward moves to 10% for the largest upward moves.
The firm effects also capture the magnitude of the earnings declines. As emphasized by Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff (2014), a measure of bias in firm effects (or, in their case, teacher valueadded) is to consider the β1 coefficient in the following regression:
h

= β0 + β1 Ψ̂J(i,t) − Ψ̂J(i,t−1) + i,t , ∀ i,t s.t. J (i, t) 6= J (i, t − 1),

(4)

˜
r = y − x0 β̂ is the residualized earnings, and Ψ̂
where yi,t
i,t
J(i,t) is the shrunken firm effect. If the
it
firm effects are unbiased, then we expect β̂1 = 1. The top panel of Figure 2 shows that this is the
case. The figure plots 20 bins of changes in firm effects at all transitions between annual dominant
employers against the average individual-level change in earnings on these transitions. The solid
line plots the best-fitting line from a regression run on the individual-level data. The thin-dashed
line shows the line that would be expected if the firm effects were unbiased. The lines are identical
and the coefficient is 1.005. The bottom panel shows the analogous figure for the EE transitions,
and the slope is 0.813. Formally this finding could be interpreted as indicating misspecification,
though it is not clear whether the departure is quantitatively important. Figure A3 reports the
results of a conceptually similar exercise where, following Card, Heining, and Kline (2013, pg. 997),
I plot event studies around transitions from lower- to higher-paying firms and vice-versa and show
that earnings change in opposite directions with equal magnitudes.
While it may seem mechanical that the firm effects would predict the individual-level changes,
this finding does not hold if the AKM decomposition is seriously misspecified. To show this, I
simulate data from a model where mobility is on the basis of the comparative advantage (e.g.,
Eeckhout and Kircher (2011), Lopes de Melo (2016) and Hagedorn, Law, and Manovskii (2017)).
This type of model implies that the residual plays a large role in determining mobility and generates
at least two implications which are at odds with the data. First, there are no earnings cuts on EE
transitions, and the individual-level earnings changes always lie above the x-axis. Second, there
is not the approximate symmetry in earnings changes from moving to a better or a worse firm
(Card, Heining, and Kline (2013, pg. 990) emphasize this symmetry property). Figure A2 plots
the analogous figure to Figure 2b with data simulated from the example production function in
Eeckhout and Kircher (2011). The estimate of β1 is about 0.4, and unlike in the data, the earnings
changes display a v-shape in the firm effects changes.18
18
The v-shape comes from earnings increases accruing to workers whose comparative advantage is working at the
lowest productivity firms. In a model of circular heterogeneity without absolute advantage like Marimon and Zilibotti
(1999), there is no variance in the estimated firm effects because all firms are equally high- and low-paying for the
same number of workers and in the same way.

9

One explanation for moves to lower-paying firms is that workers trade-off the level of pay for
the promise of more rapid earnings growth. But the earnings declines captured by moving to lowerpaying firms are not offset by future earnings increases. Following Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis
(1999), I estimate firm-specific earnings slopes using the wage growth of the stayers. When workers
move to lower-paying firms, Figure 3 shows that they do not move to firms offering steeper slopes in
earnings (the coefficient on all moves is 0.000 and on EE moves is 0.002). Similarly, the firm effects
in the intercept are positively correlated with the slope when estimated in the same regression (the
correlation is 0.033). These results are quantitatively different than a model that explains earnings
cuts as a function of an option value of a future increase. I simulate Papp (2013)’s calibration
of Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006), which matches the share of earnings cuts in the data.
In the simulated data, the correlation between the firm effects in the intercept and the slope is
−0.90. This result implies that earnings cuts are not explained by the possibility of future earnings
increases at the same firm.

2.3

Moves to lower-paying firms are systematic

While many employer-to-employer transitions are to lower-paying firms, Panel B of Table 2 shows
that workers are more likely to transition to higher-paying firms than to lower-paying firms: 53%
of all moves are to higher paying firms.. Hence, the moves to lower-paying firms might best be
explained by idiosyncratic shocks and not be evidence of compensating differentials. To interpret
these moves as evidence of compensating differentials, I want to show that they cannot be explained
by idiosyncratic shocks.
I now develop a way of averaging out idiosyncratic shocks and extracting the systematic pattern
of mobility. I present the method in the context of a rank-aggregation problem where I view the set
of EE transitions as generated from an equal-number of workers facing the choice between any pair
of firms. In section 3, I introduce additional notation and assumptions that maps this approach
more tightly to the empirical context of flows between firms where firms might differ in the number
of workers, in their probability of making an offer, and some of the flows might reflect exogenous
shocks.
To introduce the rank aggregation problem, suppose I observe N workers choosing between
o workers choose k and M o = N − M o choose j. To
firms k and j. Out of these N workers, Mkj
jk
kj

produce a single ranking that best-rationalizes the data, suppose that the common value of firm
k is ṼkEE . When choosing between firm k and j, workers take into account the common value as
well as an idiosyncratic draw, ι, which is distributed type I extreme value with scale parameter
1. This idiosyncratic utility draw captures preference heterogeneity, where part of the preference
heterogeneity might be that workers receive a negative shock to the value of the match.19 This
distributional assumption implies that the probability of choosing firm k over j is
19

exp(ṼkEE )
.
exp(ṼkEE )+exp(ṼjEE )

Because the idiosyncratic utility draw includes negative shocks to the value of the match, I do not interpret
moves to lower-value firms that are rationalized by the idiosyncratic draw as being utility-increasing.

While it would be possible to take equation (5) directly to the data, doing so would run into two
problems. First, for many pairs of firms there are not flows in both directions so this approach would
not yield well-defined values of employers. Second, there is no guarantee that this approach would
yield consistent valuations of employers. For example, there might be Condorcet cycle-like cases
where combining the comparisons of employer A with employer B and employer B with employer C
would give different relative valuations of employer A and employer C than the direct comparison
of employer A and employer C.
To estimate the firm-level value, I relax the pair-wise restrictions embedded in the model and
instead impose only one restriction per firm, which addresses the two problems mentioned above.
First, by reducing to one restriction per firm, this model reduces to an exactly identified set of
equations and so there exists a unique set of firm-level values that best explain all the flows and do
so in a way that is computationally feasible (unlike MLE). Second, the condition for uniqueness,
which I discuss formally later in this section, is a restriction on the pattern of zeros in the flows
that is much weaker than that each pair of firms have flows in both directions. (In Appendix C
I present an over-identifying test which relies on asking whether the model estimates satisfy the
pair-wise comparisons.)
Now let E be the set of employers. Cross-multiplying (5) gives
o
o
exp(ṼkEE ), ∀j ∈ E,
exp(ṼjEE ) = Mjk

where the “for all” holds because (5) holds for all pairs of employers. Summing across all employers
on both sides gives

Equation (7) implies one linear restriction per firm. The equation generates a recursive definition

11

of employer quality: a good firm is chosen over other good firms, and has few workers not choose it.
Formally, this equation is closely related to the recursion underlying Google’s PageRank approach
to ranking webpages, which says that a good webpage is linked to by other good webpages. I now
exploit this connection to show how to estimate Ṽ EE .
To solve for the values, create the matrix version of equation (7). Specifically, define a diagonal
P
o . Then letting exp(Ṽ EE ) be the |E| × 1
matrix S with the ith diagonal entry being Siio = j∈E Mji
vector that contains the firm-level exp(ṼkEE ) yields the following:

values

This equation allows me to solve for exp(Ṽ EE ). Intuitively, exp(Ṽ EE ) is the fixed point of the
function S o,−1 M o : R|E| → R|E| . In many settings in economics, fixed points can be found by
starting with an initial guess and repeatedly applying the function to the resulting output until it
converges. Despite the very high-dimensionality of the function, the same idea applies here.
I now discuss when exp(Ṽ EE ) exists. To show when the exp(Ṽ EE ) vector exists, note that in
the context of a linear system, the fixed point is an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of
1. The technical condition is that S o,−1 M o has an eigenvalue of 1 and this eigenvalue is the largest
one. Moreover, in order for the values to be interpretable, the exp(Ṽ EE ) vector needs to be all
positive so that Ṽ EE is defined (the log of a negative number is not defined).
Result 1. Let S o,−1 M o be matrices representing the set of flows across a set of employers and be
defined as above. If the adjacency matrix associated with M o represents a set of strongly connected
employers, then there exists a unique-up-to-multiplicative-factor vector of the same sign exp(Ṽ EE )
that solves the following set of equations:
S o,−1 M o exp(Ṽ EE ) = exp(Ṽ EE ).
Proof. See Appendix D (also for graph theory definitions).
This result shows that I can estimate the value of employers in the strongly connected set.
Strongly connected is a restriction on the pattern of zeros in the M o matrix. To be in the strongly
connected set, an employer has to both hire a worker from and have a worker hired by an employer
in the strongly connected set. This result is intuitive. The information used to estimate values is
relative flows. If an employer either never hires, or never has anyone leave, then we cannot figure
out its relative value. To see this, consider equation (7). If a firm never hires, then its value is
mechanically zero. Alternatively, if a firm has no workers leave, then the denominator is zero and
the value of the firm is infinite. This result is related to the identification result in Abowd, Creecy,
and Kramarz (2002) who show that the employer fixed effect in Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis
(1999) can only be estimated in the connected set of employers. To be in the connected set, an
employer has to either hire a worker from or have a worker hired by an employer in the connected
set.
12

The analogy to Abowd, Creecy, and Kramarz (2002) is helpful in understanding the data
requirements to estimate Ṽ EE . As in Abowd, Creecy, and Kramarz (2002), it is not necessary for
there to be flows between every pair of employers to estimate the relative values (or relative pay).
All that is required is that there is enough information in the non-zero entries to learn about each
firm. It is possible to construct examples where in the limit as the number of firms grow the share
of non-zero entries goes to zero, but the values remain well-estimated.20
Remark on Result 1: Because the discrete choice setting implies that the S o matrix is different
than in standard applications, the novelty in result 1 is showing that the top eigenvalue is 1 (the
Perron-Frobenius theorem is used to show that the top eigenvector is unique). S o divides the ith
row of M o by the ith column sum of M o . In other applications (e.g., Pinski and Narin (1976),
Page et al. (1998) (Google’s PageRank), and Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2004)), the normalizing
matrix instead divides the ith column of M o by the ith column sum. This normalization makes the
resulting matrix a transition matrix and standard results imply that the top eigenvalue is 1. With
the alternative normalization implied by the discrete choice model, standard results do not apply.
The diagonal entries in M o are not defined using the discrete choice setting (or the search model
defined below). The following result shows that because of the normalization, the top eigenvector
of S o,−1 M o is invariant to the value of the diagonal entries in M o .
Result 2. Suppose that exp(Ṽ EE ) is a solution to exp(Ṽ EE ) = S o,−1 M o exp(Ṽ EE ) for a particular
0

set of {Mk,k
k∈E . Pick arbitrary alternative values of the diagonal: {Mk,k }k∈E 6= {Mk,k }k∈E . Let

S o and M o be the natural variants on S o and M o . If exp(Ṽ EE ) solves the equation exp(Ṽ EE ) =
0

0

S o,−1 M o exp(Ṽ EE ), then it also solves the equation exp(Ṽ EE ) = S o −1 M o exp(Ṽ EE ).
Proof. See Appendix D.
Remark on Result 2: A natural statistic to compute to assess the noise in the estimation of Ṽ EE
is the spectral gap, or the difference between the first and second eigenvalues. This result shows
that the spectral gap is not pinned down by the data because, in general, the second eigenvalue
depends on the diagonal entry in the matrix.21
Panel C of Table 2 shows that by picking a ranking to fit the pattern of EE mobility, it is
(perhaps unsurprisingly) possible to fit the pattern of mobility better than ranking firms based on
pay. Specifically, while 57% of EE moves are to higher paying firms, 66% of EE moves are to higher
Ṽ EE firms. The remaining rows of Panel C show that while Ṽ EE fits the moves better than pay,
it is related to pay: a move to a higher-paying firm is more likely to yield an increase in Ṽ EE than
a move to a lower-paying firm. Panel A of Figure 4 shows this pattern more generally.
20
Suppose that there are flows (in both directions) between firms 1 and 2, 2 to 3, and N − 1 to N (assuming N
is even). Then the number of non-zero entries in M o is proportional to N (2N − 2), while the number of entries is
proportional to N 2 . Hence, the share of non-zero entries is proportional to N1 and goes to zero as N grows large.
But if the number of observations going into each of these comparisons grows, then theestimates
of Ṽ EE converge.

x y
21
To see this point in a simple example, consider the following matrix: M o =
, where y > 0, and
y x
x ∈ (−∞, +∞). The eigenvalues of the normalized matrix are {1, x−y
}. If we restrict attention to x ≥ 0, then this
x+y
second eigenvalue ranges from [−1, 1). If we allow x < 0, then the range of the second eigenvalue is (−∞, 1).

13

Nevertheless, 30% of the moves with the biggest decreases in firm effects see an increase in
Ṽ

EE .

The revealed preference logic suggests that the presence of a systematic pattern of moves to

lower-paying firms implies nonpay characteristics which outweigh the pay cuts. Panel E of Table
2 confirms that on average workers do move to higher-paying firms, but the systematic pattern
of mobility is not perfectly explained by pay: the correlation coefficient between Ṽ EE and Ψ is
0.43. An alternative implementation of the revealed preference logic used in this paper would be
to assume a frictionless labor market and use market share (size) as a marker of utility. Compared
to this marker, Ṽ EE is much more tightly aligned with pay. For example, the rank correlation
coefficient between size and Ψ is only 0.07.
Moves to lower-paying firms do not reflect (mass) layoffs: A natural concern is that moves
to lower-paying firms might not reflect workers’ preferences. Instead, workers might have been
laidoff. Note that the computation of Ṽ EE already allows for one form of layoffs through the
idiosyncratic shocks. Specifically, because Ṽ EE captures the average pattern of mobility, it allows
for any given move to be value decreasing. An additional way of addressing this concern is to follow
a tradition starting with Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993) and use negative firm growth rates
as a proxy for negative firm-level shocks. I restrict to firm-years whose annual growth rates are in
the interval [−10%, +20%]. Panel F of Table 2 shows that when I estimate Ṽ EE in this restricted
sample, the correlation rises to 0.57, but is still far from 1.
Moves to lower-paying firms do not reflect differences in offer intensity (or size): The
data-generating process described above relied on the implausible assumption that all firms are the
same size and make the same number of offers. In the next section, I write down a search model
that nests the approach developed in this section. This model implies that under the assumption
that all workers search from the same offer distribution, the appropriate functional form to adjust
for offers and size is exp(Ṽ EE ) fgo , where g is the size of the firm and f o is a measure of the share
of offers. The intuition for this functional form is that large firms will have more workers leaving
them than small firms, but this does not mean that they are less desirable firms. Similarly, firms
that make lots of offers will hire lots of workers, but this does not mean that they are desirable—in
the context of the model, they are simply hunting for good draws of idiosyncratic utility.
To implement this correction, I need a measure of the share of offers made by a firm, or f o
(helpfully, g is observed in the data). The feature of the data that I use to measure the offer
distribution is the share of workers hired from nonemployment hired by a particular firm. Using
where nonemployed workers are hired to measure the offer distribution facing employed workers
relies on two assumptions. The first assumption is that employed and nonemployed workers search
from the same offer distribution. The second assumption is that the nonemployed workers do not
reject offers and so where they are hired reveals the offer distribution.
Panel F of Table 2 shows that when I adjust Ṽ EE by adjusting for offers and size the correlation
between the adjusted Ṽ EE and the firm effect, Ψ, rises to 0.57, but is still far from 1.
The next section develops an economic model that nests equation (7) in a data generating
process that more closely matches the labor market context rather than the static discrete choice
14

context of the rank aggregation problem. An additional feature of the model is that it incorporates
the features of the data discussed in this section. Moreover, it makes precise the (strong) assumptions needed to interpret aggregate firm-level outcomes as revealing information about values and
nonpay characteristics.

Ranking firms using revealed preference

3.1

A model with utility-posting firms

The model is a partial equilibrium, posting, random, on-the-job search model with exogenous
search effort and homogeneous workers in the spirit of Burdett and Mortensen (1998) where firms
post utility offers. This class of models is sometimes described through the metaphor of a job
ladder, where there is a common ranking of firms and workers try to climb the ladder through
employer-to-employer mobility. Partial equilibrium and posting mean that I do not model the
source of firm heterogeneity, and instead treat firms as mechanical objects. Posting means that
there is no bargaining. Random means that search is not directed. Random search, jointly with
the assumption that nonemployed and employed workers search from the same offer distribution,
gives enough structure to estimate the offer distribution. On-the job search is where the “revealed
preference” action in the model is: sometimes workers get outside offers and decide whether or not
to accept them. Exogenous search effort means that the arrival rate of offers does not depend on
a worker’s firm. Finally, the assumption of homogeneous workers means that the world looks the
same to all workers—specifically, they have the same search parameters, search from the same offer
distribution and—up to an i.i.d. draw—value all firms the same.
Types of separations
Before getting into the details of the model, I discuss at a conceptual level the types of separations
that occur in the model, the motivation for these definitions, and what these are in the data.
As the rank aggregation exercise in section 2 highlights, the dataset I want to approximate is
one with workers’ choice sets and the choices they made. It is conceptually clear what this dataset
means in the case of unemployed workers who are looking for a job.22 One example of such a paper
is Stern (2004) in the context of PhD scientists looking for their first job, where he collects the
set of offers the scientists received and their ultimate decision. Similarly, Hall and Mueller (2017)
have information on offers and acceptances for unemployed workers in New Jersey. In the empirical
context of this paper of studying transitions between employers, it is hard to imagine a dataset
that perfectly captures worker choice sets. One way to try to figure out whether workers had the
choice of staying at their incumbent employer is to ask whether the worker separated in a quit or
layoff, and then only use information in quits on the assumption that workers who report a quit had
the choice of staying. This approach, while appealing, has some limitations. A long tradition in
22

The reason is that in these cases we can difference out the value of unemployment and have a cleaner comparison
of the value of the multiple job offers.

15

economics has discussed whether the quit-layoff distinction is meaningful in the presence of efficient
turnover.23 Concretely, this distinction is ambiguous because workers can quit when they see the
writing on the wall, or can be laid-off when they decide that they want to quit and so reduce
effort. Moreover, this distinction may not map into the choice set logic because quits respond to
both push and pull factors. For example, Flaaen, Shapiro, and Sorkin (2016) document that the
probability of separating and reporting a “quit” in survey data increases when employers contract.
This finding suggests that survey-reported quits respond to both the pull factor of an outside offer,
and the push factor of the change in the value of a current match.
Rather than trying to approximate the quit-layoff distinction, the model features two classes
of separations: endogenous and exogenous. In the model, an endogenous separation comes from
a maximizing choice, while an exogenous separation is one where the worker does not make a
maximizing choice. In terms of the choice set logic, I only interpret the endogenous moves as
potentially revealing preferences, while I interpret the exogenous moves as being like layoffs. The
maximizing choice in the endogenous moves takes into account both the common value of employers
as well as an idiosyncratic utility shock. Because the idiosyncratic utility shock can be negative, a
given EE move can reflect a mix of the pull factor of the desirability of the outside offer, and the
push factor of the decline in the desirability of the current firm. In terms of the logic of surveyresponses, were we to ask a worker whether a given endogenous move was a quit, many of them
might respond “no” because the separation was in response to a negative shock at the incumbent
employer.
In the data, I operationalize the distinction between endogenous and exogenous as follows. The
model has a theory of the probability of an endogenous separation at each employer in each time
period, which is given by the combination of the value of the employer, the randomness of offers,
and the idiosyncratic utility draw. I view separations in excess of this probability at contracting
employers as exogenous. The motivation for this distinction is that these excess separations are
likely due to a firm-level shock. While a richer model would feature explicit firm-level shocks
and then model how these shocks get propagated through the employment relationship and into
separations, doing so is well-beyond the scope of this paper.
Here are some examples of what I have in mind when I refer to exogenous job destruction (EN)
and reallocation (EE) shocks. An example of an exogenous job destruction shock is a mass layoff as
in Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993). And an example of an exogenous reallocation shock are
the EE transitions resulting from the increase in search activity in advance of mass layoff suggested
by, for example, Bowlus and Vilhuber (2002), where the idea is that workers know their firm is
about to undergo a mass layoff and so take jobs that they would not have in the absence of the
impending mass layoff.
23

See, for example, Becker, Landes, and Michael (1977) and McLaughlin (1991).

16

Employers
What does an employer do in the model? An employer j posts a flow payoff vj , share of offers
denoted by fj and employs a share of workers denoted by gj . Finally, employers also differ in their
exogenous separation rates δj and ρj , where δj is the probability of an exogenous job destruction
shock that sends a worker to nonemployment, and ρj is the probability of an exogenous reallocation
shock. While my notation allows these shocks to be firm-specific, in estimation they vary across 20
sectors. Combined, the forward-looking value of being at firm j is denoted by V e (vj , δj , ρj ), which
I abbreviate as Vje . This value includes both pay and nonpay components, Vje = ω(Ψj + aj ), where
aj is the nonpay characteristic at firm j and ω is the (unknown) unit conversion from log dollar
units to forward-looking values.
Were I to impose steady state, then there would be a mechanical relationship between fj and
gj (given all other parameters of the model). In estimation, I do not impose steady state so that
I allow firms to grow and shrink. Because I do not impose steady state, one might think that
growing firms would be mechanically better. In fact, the correlation between firm growth rates and
the estimated value is negative: −0.10.
Workers
What does a worker do in the model? The following Bellman equation summarizes how the model
looks to a worker. A worker at employer j has the following value function:24

Reading from left to right, a worker employed at j has value V e (vj , δj , ρj ) = Vje . This value consists
of the deterministic flow payoff, vj , and the continuation value, which she discounts by β.
The continuation value weights the expected value of four mutually exclusive possibilities. Two
24

The fact that the idiosyncratic shock shows up on the forward-looking values, rather than in the flow payoff,
may look odd but is standard in the conditional choice probability literature. See Arcidiacono and Ellickson (2011,
pg. 368).

possibilities generate exogenous separations. With probability δj , a worker is hit with a job destruction shock and ends up in nonemployment, where she receives value V n + ι1 , where V n is
the common component of the value, and ι1 is an idiosyncratic draw from a type I distribution.
With probability ρj , a worker is hit with a reallocation shock and is forced to make an employer-toemployer move. The density of such offers from firm j is f˜j , and the summand is over the set of all
employers. If this happens, the worker receives value Vje + ι2 , where Vje is the common component
of the value, and ι2 is an idiosyncratic draw from a type I distribution.
Two possibilities generate endogenous separations. If neither of the exogenous separations
happen, then with probability λ1 a worker receives an offer from another firm, the probability the
offer is from any particular firm is fk (note that this distribution is distinct from the distribution
following reallocation shocks), and the worker makes a maximizing choice of whether to accept or
reject the offer. The worker compares Vke + ι3 and Vie + ι4 and makes a maximizing decision. Note
that the ιs are drawn independently. Finally, if she does not receive an outside offer, then the
worker makes a maximizing choice of whether to “quit” to nonemployment.
In equation (9), the model contains ingredients to address each of the three issues mentioned
above. First, when a worker considers an offer from another firm she considers both the value of
the firm, the Vje , as well as the idiosyncratic utility draw, ι. By taking into account the ι, the
model allows workers to make off-setting moves and, more generally, for gross flows to exceed net
flows. Second, the ρi shocks allow the possibility that workers move between firms in an exogenous
way. Third, the fact that different firms can make a different share of offers (i.e., it might be the
case that fj 6= fk ) means that patterns in mobility can reflect differences in offer rates rather than
differences in value.

no offer

Reading from left to right, a nonemployed worker receives a total value of nonemployment of b,
which includes both unemployment benefits as well as the value of nonmarket time and household
production. Then each period two things might happen. She might receive an offer from an
employer, in which case she decides whether or not to accept it. Or, nothing might happen. In
this case, she receives a new idiosyncratic draw associated with nonemployment. Because of the
assumption that the nonemployed and employed search from the same distribution—that is, the f
in the second row of equation (10) is the same f in the third row of equation (9)— which firms hire
18

nonemployed workers is informative about the offer distribution facing employed workers.
Relationship between the search model and AKM
Given that I ultimately compare the V e to Ψ, I now discuss how the assumptions in the search model
and AKM relate. The take-away is that the mobility assumptions in the search model are both more
and less restrictive than the mobility assumptions in Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (AKM).
In the search model, mobility depends on Vje and ι. On the one hand, this assumption is more
restrictive than those in AKM because in AKM mobility decisions can depend also on the worker
effect (αi ), the covariates (Xi β) and the history (past and future) of firms (Ψj ). That is, in AKM
high-paid workers can have different mobility patterns than low-paid workers, or older workers can
have different mobility patterns than young workers.25 While the search model does allow mobility
patterns to depend on the identity of the current firm, this dependence is more restrictive than
what AKM assumes. On the other hand, the assumption on mobility is less restrictive than those in
AKM because I can relax the strict exogeneity assumption that mobility is independent of all past
and future realizations of the residual (rit ). Specifically, in the context of the search model, mobility
can depend on the idiosyncratic utility draw (ι). I can selection correct the earnings equation and
allow mobility to depend on the error term. See Appendix B for details.

Estimating the utility levels that firms post

This section shows how to estimate the utility levels that firms post. There are three steps of
estimation: first, I summarize the systematic pattern of worker flows, which summarizes the information in accepted offers by averaging out idiosyncratic shocks; second, I estimate the offer
distribution using information in nonemployment to employment flows, which allows for some of
the patterns in accepted offers to reflect differences in recruiting intensity; and third, I measure exogenous separations as excess separations at contracting firms. The three steps are interdependent
and I perform them in a loop.
Summarizing the systematic pattern of worker flows
This section rewrites the model so that it gives rise to the same expression used in section 2 to
measure the systematic pattern of worker flows. Relative to the derivation in section 2, the point
here is to show how the systematic pattern combines both the underlying value of the firm, the Vje ,
as well as differences in layoff rates ({δj , ρj }) as well as differences in size (g) and the offer rates
(f ). Then the remaining parts of this subsection discuss how to estimate these components.
Recall that the point of the model is to find values that rationalize the structure of flows between
employers. Record the endogenous flows between employers in a mobility matrix, denoted by M .
The (j, k) entry in M is the number of endogenous flows to employer j from employer k. In the
model, workers receive one offer at a time and, therefore, only ever make binary choices. Because
25

It is possible to include a persistent worker-firm match effect in AKM, which is not possible in the search model.

where W is the number of employed workers. To interpret this equation, note that there are gk W
workers at employer k and (1 − δk )(1 − ρk ) share of them do not undergo exogenous separations.
These workers get an offer from j with probability λ1 fj and accept the offer with probability
Pr(j  k).
To connect this model to the expressions in section 2, the model implies a simple expression
for the flow-relevant value of an employer and nonemployment. To derive this expression, consider
relative flows between pairs of employers, which are given by:

relative values

Relative flows (accepted offers) are directly related to relative values, but multiplied by relative
offers and effective size. Why do offers, and effective size matter? Offers matter because workers
flow towards a firm that makes lots of offers. These flows do not reveal that the firm is more
desirable, but that it is hunting for a good idiosyncratic draw. Effective size matters because more
workers flow away from a large firm than a small firm. These flows do not reveal that the firm is
less desirable, but that there are more chances for a negative idiosyncratic draw.
Now introduce notation which defines the flow-relevant firm-level value that summarizes the
determinants of relative flows:

exp(Ṽj ) is the flow-relevant value of an employer. It combines differences in the underlying value
of an employer, as well as differences in (effective) size and the offer rate.26

relative flow-relevant values

This expression is the same as that in section 2. There are two differences: first, I use the flows to
and from nonemployment. Second, the model now shows the appropriate functional form to adjust
for differences in layoff rates, size and offers.
The offer distribution
As discussed in section 2, the main feature of the data that I use to pin down the offer distribution
is where nonemployed workers are hired. Relative to the intuitive approach in section 2, I allow
nonemployed workers to reject offers. Two assumptions jointly allow estimation of the offer distribution, while allowing nonemployed workers to reject offers. The first assumption is common to
section 2 and is that nonemployed and employed workers search from the same distribution. In
the Bellman equations, the employed and nonemployed draw offers from a common F . The second
assumption is new relative to section 2 and is that it is only when workers do not receive an outside
offer that workers consider endogenous quits to nonemployment. In the Bellman equation (equation
(9)), the rate of “offers” of nonemployment is 1 − λ1 . The first assumption is important because it
reduces the number of parameters to estimate and allows me to incorporate another dimension of
the data.
The second assumption is important because it adds an additional moment: the level of EE
flows. The parameter that matches the number of EE transitions implies how often workers get
offers from nonemployment. Knowing how often employed workers get offers from nonemployment
then distinguishes between two explanations for relative flows between employment and nonemployment: the relative value of nonemployment and the offer rate of nonemployment.
Formally, solving for the offer distribution combines information in three equations. The first
equation defines fio , or the share of workers hired from nonemployment hired by firm i. The fact
that this is informative about the offer distribution reflects the first assumption:

Identifying exogenous separations
The revealed preference interpretation of an employer-to-employer transition relies on believing
that workers had the option of staying at their original firm. Relative to the intuitive approach in
section 2 where I threw out separations from firms that were contracting by “too much,” here I
downweight separations when the firms are contracting. This approach has the benefit of preserving
more of the information in the data.
The central idea is that there is some level of separations from the firm that we expect when
there are no shocks to the firm, and any excess separations when the firm is contracting are due
to a firm level shock. The expected level of separations are the endogenous separations in the
model that arise from outside offers that are accepted and quits to nonemployment. Since these
separations might happen because of negative idiosyncratic shocks, I do not interpret all of these
as utility-increasing moves.
Mechanically this approach finds the level of endogenous separations based on what happens
at expanding firms, and then views separations above that level when the firm contracts as the
exogenous separations. To see this approach graphically and using aggregated data, consider Figure
5.27 The figure shows EE and EN separation probabilities as a function of quarterly employer
growth. The approach takes the average separation rate on the right hand side of the graph—
where the employer is expanding—and assumes that this rate is the endogenous separation rate.
Then when the employer is contracting—on the left hand side of the graph—if the separation rate
is higher than the endogenous rate then these excess separations are viewed as exogenous. That
is, when the employer is contracting there are some workers who would have separated even if
the employer was not contracting and some who separate because the employer is contracting. In
practice, I do not know which worker falls into which group, and so I assign a probability that the
separation was exogenous to each worker who separates at a contracting firm and add these up
across years to get the exogenous separation rate at the firm.28
I now write down the equations that correspond to this idea for the EE separations and analogous equations apply for the EN separations. The model’s theory of the endogenous EE separation
probability at employer j—which corresponds to the EE separation rate at expanding firms on the
27
28

This figure is inspired by Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2012, Figure 6).
This approach is conceptually related to that in Flaaen, Shapiro, and Sorkin (2016).

(19)

where this is the probability that a worker is not laid off, gets an offer, and accepts it.
Now develop notation to measure the separation rate when the firm is contracting. Let C(t, j)
be an indicator variable for firm j being on the right hand side of Figure 5 and contracting in terms
of the number of workers in period t. The following expression records this probability (where the
o stands for observed):
Pr(EE|C(t, j) = 1)o .

(20)

Finally, combine the previous two expressions to generate an expression for the probability
that a separation at a contracting firm was “expected anyway” and so counts as an endogenous
separation:

Pr(Endog = 1|EE = 1, C(t, j) = 1) = min


Pr(Pr(EE(j))endog
,1 ,
Pr(EE|C(t, j) = 1)o

(21)

while the exogenous (exog) probability is the complementary probability: Pr(Exog = 1|EE =
1, C(t, j) = 1) = 1 − Pr(Endog = 1|EE = 1, C(t, j) = 1). In terms of the figure (and the EN
measure), the endogenous probability is the black solid line relative to the total length of the line,
while the exogenous probability is the red dashed line relative to the total length of the line. When
a firm is expanding, I assume that the exogenous probability is 0 and the endogenous probability is
1. Replacing EE with EN in the above gives analogous expressions to decompose EN separations
at contracting firms into exogenous and endogenous components.
Now I use these weights to construct two objects that feature in the model: Mji , or endogenous
mobility, and the exogenous shocks {δj , ρj }. This amounts to reweighting the observed flows (things
with o superscripts) by the probability that the flow was endogenous. For all j, k ∈ E Mkj =
P
o
t Mkj,t Pr(Endog = 1|EE = 1, t, j), and, for flows to nonemployment (n), and for all k ∈ E
P
o
Mnj =
t Mnj,t Pr(Endog = 1|EN = 1, t, j). I assume that flows from nonemployment are all
P
o . Finally, the two shocks come from summing over all the exogenous
endogenous: Mjn = t Mjn,t

To implement this approach, I need an estimate of the values of firms, which then depends on
how I divide the transitions between exogenous and endogenous. Hence, I perform this step in a
loop where I update my model-predicted separation probabilities at each step. I initialize the loop
using the average EE and EN separation rates in expanding years. In practice, it takes only a few
iterations for the loop to converge.
While it is possible to estimate firm-specific values of δ and ρ, to limit the number of parameters
to estimate I aggregate to the sectoral level in two places. Specifically, in equation (19) I take the

23

sectoral average (weighting firms by the number of person-years) of the model-implied separation
probabilities, and then use this coarser counterfactual throughout the equations in this section.
In addition, when I substitute into equation (14) to unravel for the firm-specific value, I use the
sectoral average of the δ and ρ.
Summary
Appendix F provides details on how the pieces of estimation fit together. Given a sample, there are
two loops and a grid search. The outer loop is the loop to separate the exogenous and endogenous
transitions, which is conditional on a guess for the firm values (Vje ). The inner loop is the fixed
point problem to compute the exp(Ṽ ), which depends on the division between exogenous and
endogenous transitions. The grid search is the step of finding a λ1 which generates the extent of
EE transitions. A byproduct of an estimate of λ1 is an estimate of the offer distribution F . Since
size, g, is observed, this allows me to unravel the exp(Ṽ ) and recover a new guess of the firm value,
which I use to generate an updated division of separations into exogenous and endogenous (and
estimates of the δ and ρ) and then repeat the three steps.

3.3

Measurement error

As detailed in section 4, the empirical exercise in this paper reduces to computing the R2 between
the values and earnings and so noise in either term biases me towards finding a larger role for
compensating differentials. I take three complementary approaches to addressing this possibility.
First, I use an empirical Bayes approach and shrink the estimates. Second, I split the sample in half
on the basis of workers, which lets me generate two independent estimates of the values and pay
at each firm. The correlation between these two estimates is thus informative about the amount
of noise. Third, I consider a subset of very large firms (1000 or more non-singleton observations
per year) and re-estimate the values and earnings in this subsample. Appendix G provides more
details and Appendix H provides Monte Carlo evidence.

3.4

Other model-consistent approaches to ranking firms

To provide more intuition about the model, Appendix I shows that it is also possible to rank
firms based on properties of just the worker inflows or properties of just the worker outflows. The
inflow-based measure follows Bagger and Lentz (2016) and ranks firms based on the share of hires
on (endogenous) employer-to-employer moves relative to all hires. The reason this statistic ranks
firms in the model is that “better firms hire from better firms,” where nonemployment is viewed
as an exceptionally bad firm. The outflow-based measure follows a tradition in the inter-industry
wage differential literature and ranks firms based on the (endogenous) quit rate. The reason this
statistic ranks firms in the model is that “workers are less likely to leave better firms.” Estimating
the full model has the benefit of providing a model-consistent way of separating transitions into
endogenous and exogenous, incorporating information in both inflows and outflows, providing a way

24

of measuring how important the common component of job value is relative to the idiosyncratic
part, and incorporating the feature of the data that is most directly about revealed preference: the
structure of employer-to-employer transitions.

3.5

Model parameters

Before describing the main results of the paper, I now present some results internal to the model
and discuss features of the data the model does not match.
Table 3 shows the estimated model parameters, as well as the split of separations into EE and
ENE. The top rows of Table 3 shows that the annual separation probability is about a quarter
and only two-fifths of these are employer-to-employer. About three-quarters of these EE transitions are endogenous, while only two-thirds of the ENE transitions are endogenous. Combining
the exogenous weights and the separation probabilities gives an annual exogenous employer-tononemployment, or job destruction, rate (δ) of 0.04. Combining the exogenous weights and the
separation probabilities, gives an annual exogenous employer-to-employer, or reallocation, rate (ρ)
of 0.03. The feature of the data that drives the estimates of δ and ρ is the extent to which the
EE and EN separation probabilities are higher at contracting than at expanding employers, and
the probability of employers contracting. Finally, the annual probability of receiving an offer is a
little under one-fifth. The feature of the data that drives this estimate is matching the level of EE
transitions given the estimated offer distribution and the relative values of employers. I discuss the
probability of accepting an offer from nonemployment in section 5.
While, the model matches many features of the structure and level of transitions, it does not
perfectly fit the data. Here are two features of the data the model has no mechanism to match.
First, the model has no mechanism to generate sorting of workers to firms because in the model all
workers are ex-ante identical. Second, the model does not generate the extent of the decline in the
separation rate by job-tenure because separation rates are constant within each firm.

Main results

So far I have shown how to estimate a value of each employer as revealed by worker choices, as well
as the earnings at each firm. This section shows how to combine these two measures to decompose
the variance of firm earnings into rents and compensating differentials. I find that about 70% of
the firm component of the variance of earnings reflects compensating differentials.

4.1

Measuring compensating differentials and rents

To decompose firm-level pay into rents and compensating differentials, I confront the basic challenge
that the theory of compensating differentials is typically cast in a frictionless labor market where
utility is equalized across jobs (at the margin). In contrast, this paper’s framework allows the
possibility that there are frictions so that utility is not equalized across jobs and workers earn
rents. In this setting, nonpay characteristics play two roles: first, they can augment differences
25

in pay and disperse utility, and, second, they can compensate for differences in pay and compress
utility.
To clarify what compensating differentials mean in this setting and what can be identified, I
write down a simple partial equilibrium model of a maximizing firm where there are two motives for
variation in nonpay characteristics across firms: a “Rosen” motive corresponding to variation in the
marginal cost of providing amenities, and a “Mortensen” motive corresponding to variation in the
desired level of utility provided by the firm.29 I show that knowledge of the pay and value perceived
by workers identifies the variation in amenities due to the “pure” Rosen motive, i.e., the piece of
the Rosen motive that is orthogonal to the Mortensen motive. I label nonpay characteristics arising
from this source of variation as compensating differentials. In Appendix E, I present an alternative
motivation for this decomposition where I show that the compensating differentials component
corresponds to the minimum variance of the nonpay components that rationalizes the firm-level
measures of value and pay assuming additive separability of pay and nonpay components.
Suppose that workers’ utility functions are given by the following equation
Vje = ω(Ψj + ln aj ),

(22)

where Vje is the utility of being employed at firm j, Ψj is the (log) earnings at the firm, and aj is
the level of nonpay characteristics (amenities) provided by the firm.30 (I include an ω to allow for
there to be an arbitrary unit conversion from (log) dollars to utility. In what follows, for notational
simplicity I set ω = 1, but never use the fact that I know the units on Vje .) Firm j’s objective
function is:
max πj − cj aj − exp(Ψj )

Ψj ,aj

(23)

such that Vje = V̄je . Here, πj is the profit from hiring the marginal (and average) worker, cj is the
marginal cost of amenity provision, and V̄je is the desired level of utility provision. I allow for an
arbitrary covariance between the marginal cost of amenity provision and the desired level of utility
provision. Before considering the general case, it is helpful to consider two special cases of this
model where only the “Rosen” or “Mortensen” motives are operative.
Heterogeneity in cost of amenity provision: We can interpret Rosen (1986) as considering the
case where utility is equalized across firms so that V̄je = V̄ e , a constant. Then the only stochastic
element in the amenity provision expressions is the marginal cost of amenity provision, cj , and
the following statements are true. First, wages and amenities are perfectly negatively correlated:
Corr(Ψj , ln aj ) = −1. Second, and abusing notation, wages and utility are uncorrelated, that is,
Corr(Ψj , Vje ) = 0. Finally, the only source of variation in nonpay characteristics is the variation in
29
For example, Hwang, Mortensen, and Reed (1998), Lang and Majumdar (2004) and Mortensen (2003) construct
models where utility is not equalized across jobs and, in equilibrium, pay and nonpay characteristics are positively
correlated. Similarly, Pierce (2001) presents evidence that benefits are positively correlated with earnings.
30
In appendix J I show how to use the Hotz and Miller (1993) inversion to recover the flow-payoff, vj . I then
estimate vj = ω 0 (Ψj + a0j ), and find nearly the same relationship.

26

the cost of amenity provision across firms: V ar(ln aj ) = 41 V ar(ln cj ).
Heterogeneity in utility: We can interpret Lang and Majumdar (2004) and Mortensen (2003,
pg. 26-28) as highlighting the strikingly different implications of the case where there is no variation
in the marginal cost of amenity provision, cj = c̄, and there is variation in utility. For simplicity, set
c̄ = 1. Then the only stochastic element in amenity provision is V̄je and the following statements are
true. First, wages and amenities are perfectly positively correlated: Corr(Ψj , ln aj ) = 1. Second,
wages and utility are perfectly positively correlated, Corr(Ψj , v̄j ) = 1. Finally, the only source of
variation in nonpay characteristics is the variation in desired utility across firms: V ar(ln aj ) =
1
4V

ar(V̄je ).

Both sources of heterogeneity: Now consider the case with both sources of heterogeneity. The
previous stark results become ambiguous and depend on the relative strength of the two motives
and their covariance. First, the sign of the correlation (or the covariance) between wages and
amenities
is ambiguous, depending on the relative variances of the two motives: Cov(Ψj , ln aj ) =

1
e
4 V ar(V̄j )−V ar(ln cj ) . Second, the magnitude of the covariance between wages and utility ranges
from 0 to 1 depending on both the variance in desired utility provision and its covariance with the
cost of amenity provision, Cov(Ψj , V̄je ) =

1
2V

ar(V̄je ) + 12 Cov(ln cj , V̄je ). Finally, the variance of

nonpay characteristics
depends on the variance of the two motives as well as their covariance,

V ar(ln aj ) = 14 V ar(V̄je ) + V ar(ln cj ) − 2Cov(V̄je , ln cj ) .
In this general case, what can be identified in terms of primitives of the firm’s problem given
observables (Vje and Ψj )? I now show that I can identify the variation in amenities that comes
from the “pure” Rosen motive, or the variation in the cost of amenity provision that is orthogonal
to variation in desired utility level. But I cannot identify the variation in amenities that contribute
to utility dispersion, i.e., those that come from the Mortensen motive. The fundamental reason is
that I do not know the variance of utility in log dollar units.
To see this result, consider the hypothetical regression of the cost of amenity provision on the
variation in desired level of utility (and assume that variables are mean zero), cj = β V̄je + c̃j , where
c̃j is the residual and thus is orthogonal to V̄je by construction. This orthogonal component in the
cost of amenity provision has the following variance: V ar(c̃j ) = V ar(ln cj )−

Cov(ln cj ,V̄je )2

V ar(V̄je )

Similarly,

consider the variance in pay that is orthogonal
to variation in utility

compensating differentials

Figure 6a illustrates this result. It shows a binned scatterplot of the firm-level values and
earnings as well as the line of best fit.31 Rents can be seen in the upward slope in the line
of best fit, which shows the variation in firm-level earnings that is reflected in variation in values.
Compensating differentials—or Rosen amenities—are variation in firm-level earnings holding utility
constant. This variation is depicted in the red dashed lines that show plus and minus one standard
deviation bands of firm-level earnings holding utility constant. In contrast, because the x-axis is
in units of the standard deviation of the idiosyncratic utility draw, Mortensen amenities are not
identified. Mortensen amenities stretch out the x-axis in log dollar units, but the conversion from
log dollars to the standard deviation of the idiosyncratic draw is not known.

4.2

Decomposing firm-level pay into compensating differentials and rents

Table 4 shows that about 70% of the firm component of pay is compensating differentials, while
about 30% is rents. Aggregating this finding implies that compensating differentials account for at
least 15% of the variance of earnings, since firms account for about 21% of the variance of earnings.
The three approaches to addressing measurement error deliver quantitatively similar results.32
While this estimate of the role of compensating differentials might strike some readers as large,
it relies on a conservative interpretation of the EE moves to lower-paying firms. Recall from Panel
B of Table 2 that 43% of EE moves are to lower-paying firms. Panel D shows, however, that the
model only interprets 40% of these moves as being value-increasing moves—i.e., moves where the
increase in the nonpay characteristics fully offsets the decline in pay. More generally, the lower
panel of Figure 4b shows the share of moves that the model interprets as being to higher-value
firms as a function of the change in pay. For the largest earnings cuts, the model only interprets
20% of them as value-increasing moves.33
31

Table 2 shows that the Pearson correlation in the microdata underlying this plot is 0.53 and the Spearman
(rank) correlation is 0.51. So given a monotone relationship, the deviations from linearity are not large.

The unadjusted R2 is 0.28. The bootstrap-adjusted share is 0.30. Using the correlations between samples 1 and
0.281
2 implies an R2 of 0.306 = 0.970×0.948
. And in the large firm sample the R2 is 0.36. The Monte Carlo evidence in
Appendix H suggests that these adjustments might be biased down by one or two percentage points.
33
Moving from Ṽ EE to V e addresses two issues highlighted in section 2: layoffs, and differences in offer intensity.
The table shows three ways in which addressing these issues generates more “reasonable” answers. First, I find a
tighter alignment between pay and V e than between pay and Ṽ EE . Second, I find a tighter relationship between
size and V e than size and Ṽ EE , and size is often taken as an external marker of quality (e.g., Brown and Medoff
(1989) or Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2016).) Third, adjusting for offer intensity—which uses information in the
NE flows—shifts down the probability of making a value increasing EE move, as we would expect if some of the
systematic pattern was due to differences in offer intensity.

28

The model explains the large number of non-value increasing moves to lower-paying firms
through a large variance in the idiosyncratic shocks. Figure 7 plots the distribution of the values of the firms, and the idiosyncratic shocks. The variance of the idiosyncratic shocks is larger
than the variance of the values of firms.34 Intuitively, the relative variance of the values and the
idiosyncratic shocks is identified by the extent to which gross flows exceeds net flows.35 Given the
importance of the idiosyncratic shocks in explaining mobility, it is logically possible that all the
moves to lower-paying firms would have been best explained by idiosyncratic shocks rather than
the pursuit of common features of firms valued by all workers.
While l find an important role for compensating differentials, I also provide two sources of
evidence of rents in the labor market. First, I find that pay and values are positively correlated and
this explains a non-trivial share of the variance of firm-level pay. As I discuss in the conclusion, this
finding is consistent with a long tradition in labor economics. Second, I find that there is significant
dispersion in the underlying values of the firms relative to the idiosyncratic utility draws. Thus,
this paper provides way of quantifying the importance of a common job ladder in explaining worker
mobility, which is at the heart of many frictional models of the labor market.

4.3

Relating compensating differentials and rents to observables

One potential concern with using revealed preference is that this approach amounts to labelling a
residual and so compensating differentials are observationally equivalent to measurement error. To
show that these differences do not look like measurement error, I show that these are related to
industry and locations in plausible ways.
The first characteristic is sector. Table 5 shows that sector accounts for about 30% of the
variance of nonpay characteristics, while going to 4 digit industry increases the variance share to
45%.
The estimates of sectoral-level nonpay characteristics are plausible and match intuitions about
differences in working conditions. Figure 6b plots the sector-level values and earnings (and implicitly nonpay characteristics). The x-axis shows the values, which are in units of a standard
deviation of a type I extreme value distribution. The y-axis shows the pay, which are in log-dollar
units. The vertical slices in the graph show the Rosen amenities, since these slices reflect variation in pay while holding overall value constant. As evidence of plausibility, some sectors that are
relatively high-paying relative to the value they offer workers are mining, construction and transportation/warehousing, which I interpret as evidence of compensating differentials.36 Similarly,
education, public administration and arts/entertainment/recreation are low-paying relative to the
value they offer workers, which is evidence of desirable nonpay characteristics.
34

2

The variance of the idiosyncratic shocks is π6 ≈ 1.6 by normalization. The raw variance of the values is 0.847,
while taking into account measurement error gives an estimate of 0.814.
35
To see this, return to equation (5), and suppose that flows are exactly balanced (Mjk = Mkj ). Then all flows
are gross flows and the values of the two firms are identical. Alternatively, suppose that there are only flows in one
direction and all flows are net flows. Then one firm is infinitely better than the other firm.
36
Holzer, Katz, and Krueger (1991, Figure 1) present a similar sector-level scatterplot, in their case of industry
wage differentials and application differentials and interpret it in a similar way.

29

The second characteristic is location. Table 5 shows that state captures 8% of the variance
of nonpay characteristics. Similarly, county explains 15%. Consistent with the intuition from the
Rosen-Roback model, the location-level variation in pay is weakly related to variation in value.
Jointly, industry and location account for about 60% of nonpay characteristics.37 Hence, much
of the variation in nonpay characteristics is related to observable characteristics, and does so in
intuitively plausible ways.

4.4

Are the compensating differentials just variation in hours?

One observable that might be important is variation in hours. In my data (as in the U.S. tax data
used by Piketty and Saez (2003) and Chetty et al. (2014) among others), I observe earnings and
not hours, and so a low-earnings job might just be a low-hours job. To the extent that variation in
hours explains the compensating differentials, this finding would add credibility to the methods of
the paper by mapping the compensating differentials to an observable. But it would detract from
the novelty as there is a long tradition in economics that people value leisure.38
To attempt to quantify the role of hours in explaining compensating differentials, I consider the
extent to which variation in hours can explain aspects of Figure 6b. The reason to focus on the
sectoral-level picture is that the data I have do not contain hours, but I can construct measures of
sectoral weekly hours using the March CPS. Hours variation explains about 15% of the variation
in sectoral compensating differentials.39 To the extent that the sectoral analysis maps into the
firm analysis, I conclude that while some of the compensating differential is variation in hours, it
is unlikely to be the main compensating differential.

5.1

Other implications
Inequality

This section considers the consequences for earnings inequality of equalizing the aRosen portion
of nonpay characteristics across jobs and compensating workers (this leaves the aMortensen portion
unpriced). Mechanically, this amounts to replacing the Ψ in the earnings equations with βV e ,
where the β is estimated from a regression of Ψ on V e . I find that equalizing nonpay characteristics
and compensating workers reduces earnings inequality.
37
Without shrinkage, this statement would be exact because the count and 4-digit industry means are estimated
in a common regression. With shrinkage, this statement is no longer exact.
38
This interpretation views variation in hours as coming from labor supply factors. Of historical interest, Smith
(1776/2003, pg. 143-144) discusses variation in hours coming from labor demand factors as a source of compensating
differentials in hourly wages and hence implicitly argues that it is annual earnings that should be equalized across
jobs: “In the greater part of manufactures, a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day of
the year that he is able to work. A mason or bricklayer, on the contrary, can work neither in hard frost nor in foul
weather, and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers. He is liable,
in consequence, to be frequently without any...The high wages of those workmen, therefore, are not so much the
recompence of their skill, as the compensation for the inconstancy of their employment.”
39
Panel A of Table A10 shows the sectoral measures of hours, and the footnote provides more detail on sample
construction. Panel B reports the R2 .

30

The effect on inequality of pricing the aRosen component is ambiguous and depends on the
correlation between nonpay characteristics and overall earnings. To see how earnings inequality
might understate well-being inequality, suppose economists dominate the data. Economists are wellpaid workers in jobs with good nonpay characteristics. Were we to equalize nonpay characteristics
and compensate workers for it, then a highly-paid worker would be even more highly paid, and so
earnings inequality would understate well-being inequality. In contrast, suppose artists dominate
the data. Artists are low-paid workers in jobs with good nonpay characteristics. Were we to equalize
nonpay characteristics and then compensate workers, then a low-paid worker would make more.
Hence, the variance of earnings would go down, and earnings inequality would overstate well-being
inequality.
Table 6 shows that equalizing nonpay characteristics and compensating workers would reduce
inequality, that is, the artist example dominates the data. About half of the effect occurs at the
industry level.
Equalizing nonpay characteristics and compensating workers has surprising impacts on the
structure of earnings. Figure 8 plots the actual distribution of earnings and the distribution in this
counterfactual.40 Inequality is reduced primarily by shifting in the lower tail of the distribution.
In contrast, Figure 8b shows a naive counterfactual. To compute this counterfactual, I multiply
the firm effects by 1 − R2 and recompute the variance of earnings. Relative to the data, the naive
counterfactual shifts in both the lower and the upper tail of the income distribution.

5.2

Ability of search models to match earnings dispersion

The message of this paper is consistent with Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011). They argue
that benchmark search models cannot rationalize the extent of earnings dispersion—measured as
the residual in a Mincerian regression—in the labor market. Their observation is that unemployed
workers find jobs quickly—which suggests that workers do not face a large amount of dispersion in
job value in the offer distribution since otherwise they would wait for a better offer.
By focusing on the behavior of employed workers, rather than unemployed workers, this paper
provides a complementary source of evidence to Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011) that rents
do not explain all earnings dispersion. The key evidence is systematic patterns of employed workers
making employer-to-employer transitions to lower-paying firms. This finding indicates that a large
portion of measured earnings dispersion is not treated by workers as reflecting dispersion in value.
I interpret this finding as evidence for compensating differentials.
Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011) argue that search models that explain earnings dispersion typically imply implausibly low values of unemployment. Because utility is only measured up
to an additive constant, I cannot compare the value of nonemployment to the average value of a job.
A statistic about the value of nonemployment that I can compare to other estimates is the share
of offers accepted among the unemployed. Hall and Mueller (2017, pg. 22) report that in their
40

I use the word counterfactual simply to summarize this mechanical measurement. The model is partial equilibrium and so I implicitly assume that this is costless for firms.

31

sample of job seekers in New Jersey collecting unemployment insurance, unemployed workers had
accepted 71.9% of offers. I estimate that the nonemployed accept 78.1% of offers, which provides
evidence that my estimate of the value of nonemployment is plausible.

6

Robustness

I now present model results estimated on a variety of subgroups, which addresses concerns that my
results are driven by learning, preference heterogeneity, or inappropriately pooling labor markets.41

6.1

Learning: age subsamples

One explanation for patterns of wage increases and decreases at job changes is that this reflects
learning in the labor market. For example, high-paying firms might be firms that hire workers
when the market learns good things about them, while low-paying firms are firms that hire workers
when the market learns bad things about them.
While a complete analysis of learning is well-beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth pointing
out the empirical implications of two extreme cases. In the symmetric updating and public learning
case the market can learn both good and bad things about a worker, this learning generates offsetting flows that are captured in the idiosyncratic shocks and it is not obvious how it biases either
the estimates of pay or overall values. In contrast, some high-skill labor markets (like academia
or high-powered corporate law) are characterized by asymmetric updating where learning only
contributes to downward mobility (e.g., assistant professors do not get tenure, law firm associates
do not make partner). In this case, such learning could lead to substantial bias in that I might
recover the opposite of the correct ranking and hence find a substantial role for compensating
differentials.
I consider two ways of detecting the presence of learning. The first is to split the sample on
the basis of age and estimate the model among young (18-34) and old (35-61) year old workers.42
The reason age is a useful way to divide the data is that Lange (2007) emphasizes that learning is
quite quick, and so it is plausible that the effects of learning on mobility and earnings dynamics
are concentrated in the younger sample. Table 4 shows that the correlation in the pay between
older and younger worker is 0.87, the values is 0.83, and the estimated non-pay characteristics is
0.78. Similarly, while there are differences in the decomposition between the two subsamples, in
both subsamples the firm-level compensating differentials account for over 15% of the variance of
earnings. The second way is to follow Card, Heining, and Kline (2013, pg. 991) and note that in
the event studies in Figure A3 there are no differential pre-trends between the workers who move to
lower- and higher-paying firms. In contrast, under a spot market assumption with public learning
where ability is more rewarded in some sectors (or firms) than others (as in Gibbons et al. (2005)),
we would expect to see larger increases in earnings among those transitioning to higher-paying firms
41
42

Limitations on computational resources meant that I only bootstrapped the main results in the paper.
This divides the sample at approximately half of the EE transitions.

32

in the pre-period. The reason we would expect to see pre-trends is because the market is updating
positively about the workers, and the spot market assumption implies that this learning would be
reflected in pay. Combining these pieces of evidence, I conclude that learning is unlikely to drive
the results.

6.2

Preference heterogeneity: gender subsamples

One concern is that the model assumes that all workers have common preferences (up to the
idiosyncratic utility shocks) and that there is no heterogeneity in the treatment effect of firms; that
is, all workers agree on the ranking. As with learning, this form of model misspecification could
lead me to find a weaker relationship between values and earnings than I would find if I indeed
took this heterogeneity into account.
It is not enough to observe preference heterogeneity for the model to be misspecified in a way
that generates evidence of compensating differentials. In terms of the earnings, heterogeneity in
treatment effects of firms will tend to find that the firm effects are less important, and so the overall
role of compensating differentials in the earnings structure would be smaller. In terms of the values,
heterogeneity tends to weaken the systematic patterns of mobility in the labor market; that is, it
will increase the variance of idiosyncratic draws relative to the values. Combined, the simplest
forms of heterogeneity do not push me towards finding a larger role for compensating differentials.
Nevertheless, one simple way to assess the role of heterogeneity is to consider gender as an
observable form of heterogeneity. Estimating the model separately by men and women, in Table
4 shows that the decomposition into rents and compensating differentials is quite similar within
each group as overall, and the weighted average says that the firm-level compensating differentials
explain about 15% of the variance of earnings. Moreover, the values and earnings of men and
women are quite correlated. As such, this evidence suggests that heterogeneity is unlikely to be
driving my results.

6.3

Worker heterogeneity: subsamples by worker fixed effects

The assumption in this paper is that all workers share a common ranking of firms. One of the stark
predictions of models of sorting based on comparative advantage is that workers of different types
will have different rankings of firms. In addition, one of the ways in which AKM relies on weaker
assumptions than the search model is that it allows for different mobility patterns as a function of
the worker type.
I split the data on the basis of the estimated worker effects (αw in equation (1)) and then
re-estimate the model in both samples. Table 4 shows that while there are differences between
the groups, the weighted average estimate is that firm-level compensating differentials account for
21% of the variance of earnings. Taking this heterogeneity into account generates a larger role for
compensating differentials than in the benchmark results, which suggests that ignoring this form
of heterogeneity is not driving the results.

33

6.4

Pooling labor markets: state and sector subsamples

The assumption in this paper is that I can treat all data as coming from one labor market. While
this aggregate perspective follows the broader Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) literature, it
is helpful to consider whether aggregation drives results.
One way to disaggregate the labor market is to estimate the model sector-by-sector. Table 4
shows the results for the five sectors where the model finds the smallest role for nonpay characteristics in explaining within-sector variation in pay.43 The key take away is that restricting to within
sector moves does not generate a tighter relationship between pay and value.
An alternative way to disaggregate the labor market is to go state-by-state. As such, I reestimate the model using only within state moves. Table 4 shows that the overall weighted average
of the decomposition is that about 14% of the variance of earnings is firm-level compensating
differentials.

7

Discussion

This paper develops a framework to measure compensating differentials that takes into account
the difficulty of measuring nonpay characteristics and the possibility of utility dispersion in the
labor market. Implementing the framework, I find some evidence that compensating differentials
play a role in explaining the variance of earnings. I reach this conclusion by focusing on the firm
component of the variance of earnings, and separating this component into rents and compensating
differentials.
This paper echoes some themes in the interindustry wage differentials literature. That literature
found differences in pay across sectors that were not explained by worker observables. Similar to the
limited success of the compensating differentials literature, Krueger and Summers (1988) found that
observable industry characteristics explained little of interindustry wage differentials, supporting
the interpretation of these differentials as rents. The exercise in this paper is related to another
exercise that supported the interpretation of interindustry differentials as rents. A long line of work
in the interindustry wage differential literature and elsewhere relates some measure of the value of
the firm derived from worker behavior to some measure of the pay “premium” and finds a positive
correlation (e.g., Ulman (1965), Dickens and Katz (1987), Krueger and Summers (1988), Holzer,
Katz, and Krueger (1991), and Card, Heining, and Kline (2012)).44 Consistent with this line of
work, I interpret the positive correlation between values and earnings as evidence of rents in the
labor market. Following Holzer, Katz, and Krueger (1991, pg. 759-760), I depart from the line
of work and interpret the correlation coefficient being less than one as evidence of compensating
differentials. With a small survey dataset, Holzer, Katz, and Krueger (1991) emphasize that the
43

Recall from Table 5 that 40 percent of the variation in pay is between sector.
Similarly, Tjaden and Wellschmied (2014) argue that earnings cuts on EE transitions do not provide evidence of
nonpay characteristics because on average workers are more likely to leave jobs after earnings cuts on EE transitions
than earnings increases.
44

34

imperfect correlation might reflect sampling variability. With a large administrative dataset, I have
shown in multiple ways that sampling variability does not drive my results.
Besides sampling variability, I have taken into account several other explanations for why the
firm component of pay does not perfectly line up with values. I started from the observation that
43% of EE moves are to lower-paying firms. I showed that these moves could not be explained by
trading off a lower intercept in pay for a steeper slope. Then I estimated a model which took into
account the following explanations for these moves: idiosyncratic shocks, layoffs, and differences in
the offer intensity. Even taking these factors into account, I still found a large role for compensating
differentials.
Nevertheless, my results still require many caveats. There might still be many layoffs in the
data. Or the simple model of the labor market I use might be a poor approximation; for example,
the model does not generate sorting between firms and workers. Although I have tried to provide
evidence on these concerns, given the nature of the data and the exercise there are necessarily
limitations to how reassuring I can be. Besides investigating these issues more fully, future work
could try to relate the nonpay characteristics to observables, or find richer datasets that require
fewer assumptions.

Notes: Sample counts are rounded to the nearest thousand. The data is at an annual frequency.
There is one observation per person per year. The observation is the job from which a person
made the most money, but only if she made at least $3, 250 (in $2011, using the CPI-U). Earnings
are annualized. The table includes person-years in which on December 31 the person was aged
18-61 (inclusive). The restriction in column (2) is that the employer had on average 15 or more
non-singleton observations each year (a total of 90 or more over the sample). The extra restrictions
in column (4) are that an employer hire a worker from nonemployment, and appears in 20 or more
of the 50 bootstrap repetitions. AKM is the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) decomposition
(see equation (1)). EE is employer-to-employer.

Notes: This table reports the main decomposition in this paper, and also shows the relationship
between quantities estimated in different subsamples. In all cases, I start with the sample in column
(3) of Table 1 and then re-estimate in the relevant subsample. In Panel A, column (1) reports the
share of the variance of earnings in the sample that can be explained by firms as in equation
(2). Column (2) computes the R2 between Ψ and V e . Column (3) follows equation (25) and
multiplies column (1) and (2) to show the share of the variance of earnings in the subsample that is
attributable to compensating differentials. Column (4) shows the share of person-year observations
that are represented in the subsample relative to the top row, where the sample is column (4) of
Table 1. The only row that adjusts for noise is the first row. In Panel B, I report correlations in
the two subsamples described in the relevant rows.

Appendix: Constructing datasets

Being able to track employers over time is central to measuring employer-to-employer flows and
administrative errors in the employer identifiers would lead to an overstatement of flows. Following
Benedetto et al. (2007), I assume that large groups of workers moving from employer A to employer
B in consecutive periods—especially if employer B did not previously exist—likely reflects errors
in the administrative data rather than a genuine set of flows. As such, I correct the employer
identifiers using worker flows. I use the Successor-Predecessor File and assume that if 70% or
more of employer A’s workers moved to employer B, then either 1) employer B is a relabelling of
employer A or 2) employer B acquired employer A. Therefore, I do not count such “moves” as
employer-to-employer transitions.

A.1

Annual dataset

I follow Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney (2003) to construct the dataset to estimate the
earnings decomposition. I depart from them to define employment in a way that is consistent
with how employment is defined to construct employer-to-employer flows, to follow more recent
literature in imposing age restrictions, and to follow more recent literature in dropping jobs with
very low earnings.
For the purposes of estimating the earnings decomposition, the annual dominant employer is
the employer from which the worker had the highest earnings in the calendar year. This employer is
chosen from the employers from which the worker had received earnings for two or more consecutive
quarters within the calendar year; the reason to make this restriction is to allow me to code transitions between employers as employer-to-employer or employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer.45
In this set of jobs, the annual dominant employer is the one with the highest total earnings in the
calendar year.
To construct annualized earnings, for each quarter within a year I first identify the nature
of the worker’s attachment to the employer. Specifically, code quarter t of earnings into one of
the following two mutually exclusive categories: full-quarter (if earnings from the employer are in
quarters t − 1, t and t + 1) or continuous (if earnings are in quarters t − 1 and t or in t and t + 1).
Annualize these earnings as follows. First, if the worker had any quarters of full-quarter earnings,
take the average of these quarters and multiply by 4 to get an annualized salary. Second, if the
worker did not have full-quarter earnings and has any quarters of continuous earnings, take the
average of these and multiply by 8 to get an annualized salary. The justification for this procedure is
that if a worker is present in only two consecutive quarters and if employment duration is uniformly
distributed then on average the earnings represent 12 a quarter’s work, while if a worker is present
45

This eliminates quarters of employment that Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney (2003, pg. 15-16) term
“discontinuous,” that is, where a worker is observed in neither adjacent quarter. Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney
(2003, pg. 15-16) report that such discontinuous quarters of employment accounted for 5 percent of person-year
observations in their final dataset. Second, it eliminates “continuous” quarters of employment where the first quarter
of the match is quarter IV within the year, and the second quarter is quarter I of the following year. Under
the assumption that continuous quarters are uniformly distributed within the year, this eliminates 18 of continuous
workers. Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney (2003, pg. 15-16) report that continuous quarters account for 11
percent of observations in their final dataset, so this eliminates about 1.4 percent of observations.

A1

in both adjacent quarters then the earnings reflect a full quarter’s work.46 Then take the log of
these earnings.
I then make two additional sample restrictions. First, I keep workers aged 18-61 (on December
31st of the year), inclusive. This is an attempt to avoid issues with retirement. This age restriction
is similar to, e.g., Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) (20-60 in Germany) and Taber and Vejlin (2016)
(19-55 in Denmark), though Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney (2003) do not report imposing
any age restriction. Second, following Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) I drop observations with
annualized earnings of less than $3,250 in 2011:IV dollars.47
I now summarize how the various sample restrictions affect the same size. Table A2 in Appendix
K shows that there are about 650 million person-employer-years before imposing an earnings test,
614 million after imposing an earnings test, and 505 million after going down to one observation
per person per year. This means that after dropping the low-earnings jobs, there are an average
of 1.2 employers per person per year.48 Table A3 shows the distribution of the number of jobs per
year in row 2 of Table A2.
Table A4 shows that on the full annual dataset, 91% share of person-year observations are
full-quarter and 9% are continuous.49 Table A5 shows the distribution of the number of years
per person. About 40% of the people are in the dataset for all 7 years, and only 13% are in the
dataset for only a single year. Table A6 shows that there is a substantial amount of mobility in
this sample: half of the workers have two or more employers. Table A7 shows that about 10% of
person-employer matches (or 30% of person-years) last for the entire span of my data. However,
almost half of matches (20% of person-years) only last for a single year.

A.2

Quarterly dataset

I build on ideas developed in Bjelland et al. (2011) and Hyatt et al. (2014). Specifically, the
procedure of restricting to jobs with two quarters of earnings and using overlapping quarters of
earnings to label an employer-to-employer transition comes from Bjelland et al. (2011, pg. 496,
equation 2). The idea of using earnings in the two quarters to select the dominant job is found in
Hyatt et al. (2014, pg. 3).
For the purposes of measuring flows, the quarterly dominant employer in quarter t is the employer from which the worker had the highest earnings summing over quarter t and quarter t − 1.
This job is chosen from among the employers where the worker had positive earnings in both quarter
t and quarter t − 1. To count as employment, the earnings must pass the the same earnings test
as for the annual dataset.50
For the person-quarters that remain after the earnings test, the goal is to select a single
employer—the quarterly dominant employer. The quarterly dominant employer is the employer
from which the worker has the most total earnings summing across t − 1 and t. There is one
46

In the small number of cases where a worker had forward-looking continuous employment in quarter IV as well as
another quarter of continuous employment at the same employer, I included this quarter in the earnings calculation.
47
Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) drop daily wages of less than 10 euros. 10 euros × ≈ 1.3 euros per dollar ×250
days per year= 3,250.
48
For Germany, Card, Heining, and Kline (2013, Appendix Table 1a, row 5) find 1.10 employers per person per
year, and this number is stable from 1985 through 2009.
49
Abowd, Lengermann, and McKinney (2003, pg. 15-16) find 84% are full-quarter, 11% are continuous, and 5%
are discontinuous.

Sum together the two quarters of earnings and multiply by 4. If the earnings are below $3,250, then drop the
person-employer match. Multiplying by 4 is justified if one assumes that each quarter is a continuous quarter of
employment. The assumption that this is a continuous quarter of employment does lead to more jobs being included
than the annual dataset; specifically, if a job is actually full-quarter, then the annualized earnings treating it as full
quarter can be lower than the annualized earnings assuming it is a continuous quarter.

exception to this selection rule. If a worker has earnings from her annual dominant employer in
quarters t − 1 and t, then this employer is the quarterly dominant employer regardless of whether it
is the employer with the most total earnings summing across t − 1 and t. The reason for prioritizing
the annual dominant job is that I want to use this quarterly dataset to code transitions between
annual dominant jobs so it is important that they appear in the quarterly dataset.
If a worker has different quarterly dominant employers in quarter t and quarter t + 1, then this
worker had earnings from both employers in quarter t and I label the worker as having undergone
an employer-to-employer transition in quarter t. If a worker has no dominant employer in quarter
t + 1, then, with one exception highlighted a little later in this section, I consider that worker to
have been nonemployed in quarter t = 1, so I label the transition from the quarter t dominant
employer as a transition into nonemployment.5152
I depart from prior work to address the possibility that workers move on the seam between
two quarters (Hyatt and McEntarfer (2012) emphasize that on some outcomes these transitions
look like employer-to-employer moves). To make this concrete, suppose that I observe a worker at
firm A in quarter t − 2 and t − 1 and at firm B in t and t + 1. Then the definitions developed
previously say that in quarter t − 1 firm A is the dominant employer and in quarter t + 1 firm
B is the dominant employer. But in quarter t the worker had no dominant employer because it
was not the second consecutive quarter of any employment relationship. So the transition from A
to B was an employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer transition. It might be, however, that the
worker’s last day at A was the last day of quarter t − 1 and her first day at B was the first day of
quarter t, so this was actually an employer-to-employer transition. The way I attempt to capture
these transitions is to use the stability of earnings across quarters to suggest that a worker was
probably employed for the full quarter in both quarters. So, if the earnings from firm A in quarters
t − 2 and t − 1 are within 5% of each other (using quarter t − 1 earnings as the denominator),
then this employer is the dominant employer in quarter t. This then allows me code the transition
from A to B as employer-to-employer. Table A8 shows that this correction accounts for 3.5% of
the employer-to-employer transitions in my dataset.
The final result is a dataset that at the quarterly level says where the person was employed
and, if this is a new job, says whether the worker came to this job directly from another job, or
had an intervening spell of nonemployment.

A.3

Combining the quarterly and annual datasets

The goal of combining the datasets is to use the detail of the quarterly dataset to label each
transition between annual dominant employers as an employer-to-employer or an employer-tononemployment-to-employer transition.
To label the transition as employer-to-employer or employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer, I
proceed as follows. First, identify consecutive observations where a worker has a different annual
dominant employer; to be concrete, suppose that the worker’s annual dominant employer is A in
2002 and B in 2003.53 Second, look at the quarterly dataset and find the last quarter that the
worker is employed at A (this might be in 2002 or 2003). Third, look at the quarterly dataset
and find the first quarter that the worker is employed at B (this might be in 2002 or 2003). If
51

Similarly, Burgess, Lane, and Stevens (2000) drop matches that only last a single quarter.
This definition of a transition into nonemployment will pick up very few recalls as employer-to-nonemploymentto-employer transitions. The reason is that even if a worker is nonemployed awaiting recall for 13 weeks, the probability
1
).
that I record a quarter with zero earnings from her employer is less than 10% ( 13
53
It is possible that a worker only appears in the annual dataset in nonconsecutive years—say, 2002 and 2004. In
this case, the procedure ends up labelling the transition an employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer.
52

A3

the last quarter at A and first quarter at B are adjacent, then there was an overlapping quarter of
earnings and I label this an employer-to-employer transition. If not, then typically I label this an
employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer transition. The exception to labelling the transition an
employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer transition is if the worker made an employer-to-employer
move through some third (and possibly fourth or fifth) employer en route to moving from A to B.
Suppose, for example, that the worker makes the following transitions (where EE is employer-toEE

EE

employer and ENE is employer-to-nonemployment-to-employer): A −−→ C −−→ B. Because the
worker only made employer-to-employer transitions between A and B, I label this an employerto-employer transition between annual dominant employers. Alternatively, suppose that I observe
EE
EN E
A −−→ C −−−→ B. Then I label the transition between annual dominant employers an employerto-nonemployment-to-employer transition.
If a worker never has another employer, then I do not attempt to label this transition. For
example, if a worker has a dominant employer in 2006 and no dominant employer in 2007, then I
do not record a separation in 2006. The reason is that this could occur for any number of reasons:
1) a worker ages out of my age range, 2) a worker moves out of my states, or 3) a worker leaves
the labor force.

Appendix: Selection-correcting the earnings

I selection-correct the earnings equation by combining the proportionality assumption and the
results of the search model. That is, I add the expectation of the error term from the search model
to the earnings equation.
In the first period of a worker’s employment relationship, this expectation depends on the
identity of her prior firm in her first year at each firm. That is, suppose a worker moves from firm
2 to firm 1, then E[ι1 |V1e + ι1 > V2e + ι2 ] = E[ι1 |ι1 − ι2 > V2e − V1e ]. In the second and subsequent
years, this selection term for a worker at employer j is
P
E\j,n P r(offer from k and not move)E[ι|offer from k and not move]
e
P
E[ι|Vj , not move] =
. (A1)
E\j,n P r(offer from k and not move)
For a worker at j, these terms—when involving other firms—are:
P r(offer from k and not move) = λ1 fk

exp(Vje )

exp(Vke ) + exp(Vje )

E[ι|offer from k and not move] = γ − log

E[ι|offer from nonemp and not move] = γ − log

exp(Vje )
exp(V n ) + exp(Vje )

!
.

(A5)

In implementation there are a couple issues. First, for the first year that a worker appears
in the dataset I do not know which selection correction term to apply; that is, it might be that

A4

the worker showed up from another firm, or it might be that the worker had already been there.
To address this, I assume that all such observations are in the second or subsequent years of the
employment relationship. Second, there are firms that I cannot estimate the revealed value of,
even though I can estimate the value of the firm in the earnings equation (these are firms in the
strongly connected set for which I cannot estimate either f or g). For the purposes of the selection
correction, I assume that fg = 1 and therefore use the mobility relevant value. Third, to speed up
computation, I discretize the firms into 1, 000 equally-sized (in terms of person-years) bins and use
the bin means to compute the selection correction.
I then use the expectation of the ι in the earnings equation. Let E[ι|i, t] denote the expectation
of the ι given the worker i’s history. Then I estimate:
yit = αi + ΨJ(i,t) + x0it β + ηE[ι|i, t] + r̃it ,

(A6)

where r̃ indicates that this is a different residual than in equation (1) because I include the expectation of ι. I find that the correlation of Ψj with and without the selection correlation is 0.99986.
Table A9 presents the variance decomposition with the selection correction.

C

Appendix: Overidentification test

The model has a theory of every entry in the M o matrix and thus it is possible to construct a wide
variety of overidentifying tests by comparing the model predictions for entries to the empirical
matrix. The overidentifying test I conduct focuses on the “dense” part of the matrix and asks how
well the top eigenvector is able to predict binary comparisons. Specifically, I study the (j, k) pairs
o 6= 0 and M o 6= 0. For each such pair, I label the winner of the binary comparison—or
where Mjk
kj
o > M o and k wins if
the “local” winner— the firm that has the most flows; i.e. j wins if Mjk
kj
o > M o . In contrast, the model says that firm k wins if Ṽ o > Ṽ o , or the “global” winner.54
Mkj
j
jk
k
The extent of disagreement between the global and local rankings is consistent with the model
being the data-generating process. When I weight the comparisons by the number of accepted
offers represented in each comparison,55 the model and the binary comparisons agree on 71.0% of
comparisons. Is 70% big or small? This number allows me to reject the null of the model being
equivalent to all firms having the same value.56 I find that the 90% confidence interval under the
random null is [49.77%, 50.23%]. Under the null that the model is the data-generating process,
the 90% confidence interval is [77.37%, 77.49%].57 This means that the data are statistically
inconsistent with the model being the data-generating process, but the economic magnitude of the
rejection is not large. Thus, I conclude that the top eigenvector of the mobility matrix does a
reasonable job of summarizing the structure of the employer-to-employer transitions.
54

The reason to focus on the top eigenvector is that adjustments for the offer distribution will affect both comparisons in the same way.

I repeat the procedure described in footnote 56 except that the probability of choosing A is given by

Appendix: Omitted Proofs

Proof of Result 1
Notational/definitional preliminaries: This follows the presentation in Minc (1988) of standard graph theory definitions. Let M be a matrix, where entry Mij measures flows from employer
j to employer i. Note that all entries in M are by construction nonnegative: the entries are either
zeros, or positive values. Let E be a set (of employers) labelled from 1...n. Let A be a set of ordered
pairs of elements of E. The pair D = (E, A) is a directed graph. E is the set of vertices, and the
elements of A are the arcs of D, which represent directed flows between employers. A sequence
of arcs (i, t1 )(t1 , t2 )...(tm−2 , tm−1 )(tm−1 , j) is a path connecting j to i. The adjacency matrix of a
directed graph is the (0, 1) matrix whose (i, j) entry is 1 if and only if (i, j) is an arc of D. An
adjacency matrix is associated with a nonnegative matrix M if it has the same zero pattern as M .
The directed graph is strongly connected if for any pair of distinct vertices i and j there is a path in
D connecting i to j and j to i. The directed graph is connected if for any pair of distinct vertices
i and j there is a path in D connecting i to j or a path connecting j to i.
Proof. Observe that if M is strongly connected, then every column sum is nonzero so that the
adjacency matrix associated with M is the same as the adjacency matrix associated with S −1 M.
By Minc (1988), chapter 4, theorem 3.2, a nonnegative matrix is irreducible if and only if
the associated directed graph is strongly connected. By Minc (1988), chapter 1, theorem 4.4,
an irreducible matrix has exactly one eigenvector in E n (the simplex). If M represents a set
of strongly connected firms then these two theorems (often jointly called the Perron-Frobenius
theorem) guarantee the existence of a unique solution of the form:
S −1 M exp(Ṽ ) = λexp(Ṽ ),
where all the entries in exp(Ṽ ) are of the same sign.
All that remains to show is that λ = 1. Consider the j th row of S −1 M exp(Ṽ ) = λexp(Ṽ ). Let
ej be the basis vector; that is, it is a zero vector with 1 in the j th row.
[S −1 M exp(Ṽ )]j = [λexp(Ṽ )]j ,

P P
where || · ||1 is the l1 norm of a matrix so for an arbitrary matrix A we have ||A||1 = k j |akj |.
Note that ||M ej ||1 is a scalar.
Because M is a nonnegative matrix, we can rewrite the l1 norm as a dot product with a vector
of ones. Specifically, let 1 be a column vector of 1s:
||M ej ||1 = 1T M ej .

Appendix: Alternative derivation of the decomposition in section 4

Result 3. Suppose that the utility function is given by equation (22) and that {Vje }j∈E and {Ψj }j∈E
are known. Then
V ar(aRosen ) = (1 − R2 )V ar(Ψ),
V ar(aMortensen ) ∈ [0, ∞)
and combining them, we have
V ar(a) ∈ [V ar(Ψ)(1 − R2 ), +∞),
where R2 = Corr(V e , Ψ)2 . The willingness to pay for Rosen and Mortensen amenities is one. The
Rosen amenities are related to earnings as follows:

Corr(Ψ, aRosen ) = − 1 − R2 .

Bounds on the variance of utility in log dollar units are:
V ar(Ψ + a) ∈ [V ar(Ψ)R2 , ∞).
Proof. It is helpful to first have explicit expressions for a number of quantities. Write the R2
between Ψ and V in terms of the known variable V and the unknown variable a:
Cov(Ψ, V )2

It is also helpful to write V ar(a) in terms of one unknown quantity by rearranging equation (A21):

A lower bound on V ar(a): To minimize V ar(a), start with the expression for V ar(a) (equation
(A24)) in terms of Cov(Ψ, a) and take the first order condition with respect to Cov(Ψ, a):
2(1 − R2 )V ar(Ψ) + 2Cov(Ψ, a)

The second order condition is R2 V ar(Ψ)
, which is positive. Substitute this into the expression for
V ar(a) (equation (A24)) to get that the minimum value is given by:

V ar(a) =

(1 − R2 )V ar(Ψ)2 + 2(1 − R2 )V ar(Ψ)(−(1 − R2 )V ar(Ψ)) + (−(1 − R2 )V ar(Ψ))2

treating R2 as a constant (because it is observable data):

Rosen vs. Mortensen amenities: To decompose the a term into Rosen and Mortensen amenities, note that the properties of the Rosen amenities correspond to the lower bounds in these results,
while the properties of the Mortensen amenities correspond to the upper bounds.
To see that the aRosen term captures variation in pay while holding value constant, consider the
following equation:
Ψ = βV e + .

(A44)

Treating this equation as a regression (where we have demeaned V e and Ψ, which is without loss
of generality because they are only identified up to location), we have:
β̂ =

Cov(Ψ, V e )
.
V ar(V e )

(A45)

And:
ˆ = Ψ − β̂V e .

(A46)

Note that ˆ = −aRosen because it generates variation in pay (Ψ) while holding value constant.
Hence, aRosen and Ψ are in the same units and so workers are willing to trade them off one-for-one.

These are exactly the properties of a at the lower bounds.
The properties of a at the upper bound correspond to the properties of aM ortensen (conditional
on the variance being positive). In terms of interpretation, Corr(Ψ, aM ortensen ) > 0 means that
a hedonic regression would find a wrong-signed coefficient on aM ortensen and hence corresponds
to the explanation for the absence of evidence of compensating differentials that desirable nonpay
characteristics are positively correlated with pay. Note that aM ortensen does not correspond to
nonpay characteristics that are orthogonal to pay.
Willingness to pay for Rosen and Mortensen amenities: Note that in these derivations
V e = ω(Ψ + a) so that by construction the Rosen and Mortensen amenities are in the same units
as Ψ (log dollars) and workers are willing to trade-off one-for-one between log dollars and the
amenities.

Step 0 Initialize the model EE and EN probabilities using EE and EN probabilities at expanding
firms. The relative size of employers (gj ) and the number of workers (W ) are summary
statistics of the data. Initalize {Vje }j∈E to be a constant.
Step 1 Exogenous separations: Using the method described in section 3.2, build M and compute δ
and ρ using these probabilities.
Step 2 Central tendency of worker flows: Using equation (8), compute exp(Ṽ ).
Step 3 Offer distribution: Compute f by doing a grid-search on λ1 to match the level of EE flows.
As an output this gives a new value of {Vje , fj }j∈E as well as λ1 . See below for more detail.
Step 4 Given the new values of {Vje }j∈E use equation (19) to compute the new counterfactual separation probabilities. If the size-weighted correlation between the old and new {Vje }j∈E is less
than 0.999, then return to step 1.

Appendix: Addressing measurement error

This appendix provides more details on two approaches to addressing and quantifying the role of
measurement error in driving my results.
Approach 1: Shrinkage
The first approach uses an empirical Bayes approach to shrinkage. Specifically, I follow Morris
(1983) and use estimates of the standard errors to downweight noisier observations. In my context,
measurement error means that I overstate the variance of the underlying values and so understate
the correlation.
Standard errors
To compute standard errors, I use the bootstrap.
To maintain the dependency structure in the data, I resample at the level of worker-year-pairs.
That is, if I have three earnings observations for worker w, {yi,t−1 , yi,t , yi,t+1 }, then I create a set of
two observations, {(yi,t−1 , yi,t ), (yi,t , yi,t+1 )}, where I record how the worker moved (i.e., EE, ENE,
or not at all) from the employer in the first period to the second period.60 The asymptotic thought
experiment that this relates to is allowing W in equation (11) to grow.

To make this computationally feasible, group firms into 1, 000 categories on the basis of the firm values (V e ).
While this procedure places equal weight on each transition between employers, it double-counts the interior
earnings observations (in this case, the year t earnings observations). Hence, to compute the earnings decomposition in
the bootstrap resamples I delete duplicate interior earnings observations. Formally, if an interior earnings observation
appears n times in the bootstrap replicate, then I include the observation d n2 e times, where this notation is the ceiling
operator that rounds up to the nearest integer.
60

A13

Two issues arise in the bootstrap: first, how to normalize estimates and second, the identified
set. Because both Vje and Ψj are only identified up to location, I need to normalize the value of
one j. I normalize the location of Ψ by assuming that the estimates are noiseless for a very large
firm. I normalize the location of Vje by setting V n = 0 in all repetitions.
The second issue is that the identified set of firms varies across bootstrap resamples. The reason
is that the strongly connected set of firms differs across the bootstrap resamples. This means that
there will be a different number of observations to estimate the variability of each of the parameters
(that is, smaller firms will typically have fewer resamples). I address this in two steps. First, my
initial sample selection eliminates the smallest firms where this issue is likely to come up the most
(i.e., I eliminate firms that have fewer than 90 non-singleton observations). Second, I compute 50
bootstrap replications and only keep firms that show up in at least 20 of them.
Shrinkage
I use the standard errors to shrink the estimates of Vje and Ψj . Formally, I follow the empirical
Bayes approach laid out by Morris (1983). My exposition follows Online Appendix C in Chandra
et al. (2016).
Define some notation. Let j be a firm. Let nJ be the number of firms. Let np(j) be the number
of person years represented by firm j. Let qj be a measure of the quality of the firm—i.e., either Vje
or Ψj . Let q̂j denote the estimate of q for firm j. Let Q be the nj × 1 vector of q̂j . Let π̂j2 denote
the variance of the estimate. Let σ̂ 2 denote the estimate of the true variance of qj . Let xj be an
nx × 1 vector of characteristics of firm j. I use a set of dummies for 4-digit industry and county.
Let X be the stacked vector of the x0j . Let λ be an nx × 1 vector of coefficients. Finally, let wj be
the weight of firm j and W be the nJ × nJ matrix with wj on the diagonal.
The following equations show how these terms relate.

The two unknowns are σ̂ 2 and λ̂. These are solved for in a loop. Initialize wj = np(j) . Then
iterate the following till convergence:
1. Compute λ̂, then a new estimate of σ̂ 2 (using the above equation).
2. Check if σ̂ 2 has converged. If not, update the weights, wj , and return to step 1.
The feasible shrinkage estimator is:

(A81)

(A82)

where this reflects the assumption that the measurement error in A and B is uncorrelated.
Recall that λ̂ is the vector of coefficients, which reflects industry and location means of the
measure of quality. For some purposes I am interested in comparing these. Hence, I shrink λ̂ using
the observation that λ̂ is computed from the following regression:
√
√
W Q = λ W X,
(A83)
and so I can estimate the variance around the λ̂ using analytical formulas for the variance-covariance
matrix, and then shrink these estimates using the formulas above.
Approach 2: Split samples
A second approach to quantifying the importance of measurement error is to split the sample in
half. Specifically, I divide the sample based on people by randomly allocating each unique person
into sample 1 or sample 2. By splitting on the basis of people, I get two independent estimates of
the value and pay at each firm that shows up in strongly connected set defined by each subsample.
With two independent estimates of the same quantity, I can estimate how much of the variance is
due to noise.
Formally, let Vˆj e,1 be the estimate in subsample 1 and V̂je,2 be the estimate of the value of being
employed at firm j in subsample 2. Assume that:
V̂je,1 = Vje + j,1

(A84)

V̂je,2 = Vje + j,2 .

(A85)

and

Because the samples are mutually exclusive, the errors are uncorrelated and Cov(j,1 , j,2 ) =

A15

0, Cov(V̂je,2 , j,1 ) = 0, and Cov(V̂je,1 , j,2 ) = 0 ∀ j. Hence,

Appendix: Monte Carlo evidence

This appendix describes Monte Carlo evidence on the properties of the estimators used in this
paper.

Simulation details
There are a few high-level issues that inform the design of the Monte Carlos. First, the search
model does not impose steady state so that firms can grow or shrink over time. Hence, if I take
the set of parameter values and run the model for a large number of periods then, in the limit, the
data would be dominated by a small number of firms. Second, the method to identify exogenous
separations relies on variation in the growth rates of a given firm over time. Hence, in order to have
a simulation that generates data where it is possible to include all steps of estimation, I need to
have multiple time periods. Third, as is well-known, in order to run AKM it is necessary to have
multiple observations per worker and to follow workers across firms (whereas in the search model
the identify of workers is irrelevant). Fourth, it is computationally intensive to estimate the model.
To balance these various considerations, I proceed as follows. First, to address the fact that it
is computationally intensive to estimate the model, I randomly sample of firms. To preserve the
size distribution of firms, I stratify the firms by size and then sample from each bin, where the bins
contain an equal number of person-years. The bootstrapping is especially time-intensive, so I report
a one-in-200 sample for the bootstrapping results and a one-in-10 sample for all results.61 Second,
to generate multiple observations over time, I divide the number of non-singleton person-years at a
61

To show the effect of varying network density, I also report one-in-20 samples.

g W

firm in four ( j4 ) and thus allow for five periods. Third, to allow for variation in firm growth rates,
I set the realization of δj and ρj to zero in three periods, and equal to 4{δj , ρj } in one period (I
do not tell the model estimation code which time period this occurs). Fourth, to generate a panel
of workers, in each of the four years I follow workers between the two employers. If the firm grows
from one year to the next, then I cut-off worker histories randomly. In contrast, if the firm shrinks,
then I add new workers. The net result of this procedure is that workers appear in the simulated
data for at most five periods, but there is a distribution of the length of the worker’s labor market
histories.
The last piece of the simulation is constructing earnings by person-year. I draw the person effects
from a normal distribution. I draw residuals in an independent way from a normal distribution.
Because the model does not generate sorting between firms and workers, these are picked so that
the AKM decomposition generates that firms account for 0.21
0.9 of the variance of earnings, workers
0.11
are 0.57
and
the
residual
is
,
where

divide

because
I do not generate (meaningful)
0.9
0.9
covariates in the simulations (i.e., so that the rest of the code will run I generate years, ages, and
an indicator for the type of quarter, but then I do not impute any explanatory power to these
variables).
I report the results of 100 simulation runs.

Results
Table A1 reports the results of these simulations. The left-hand side of the table shows results from
one in 10 sampling, the middle reports results from one in 20 sampling, and the right-hand side
of the table shows the results from one in 200 sampling. Panel A reports the (percentage point)
gap between the true and estimated values that are relevant for the quantitative bottom-line of the
paper, while the italicized rows report the levels of the true values.62 The basic point to take from
Panel A is that the estimation procedure is slightly biased down, but the bias is quantitatively
small. Focusing on the one in 10 sampling, the bias down in the raw measure is two percentage
points while the bias in the various corrected measures is one percentage point. The basic point
to take from comparing the one in 10 sampling and the one in 20 sampling is that the different
sampling rate does not have a big effect on the estimates. For example, the median gap between
the true and estimated R2 between V e and Ψ are both one percentage point. Finally, the one in
200 sampling shows that the bootstrap performs similarly to the split sample approach.
Panel B reports the correlation between the true and estimated values of Ψ, V e , and Ṽ EE across
simulation runs. The table allows us to understand the result in Panel A that the procedure is
not particularly biased. Specifically, the table shows that given the sample sizes, Ψ and V e are
estimated without that much noise. The correlation between the true and estimated Ψ is 1.00, and
the correlation between the true and estimated V e is also very high, 0.98. In contrast, the table
shows that the estimation of the Ṽ EE is much noisier. Why is Ṽ EE so much noisier than V e ?
The basic reason is that estimation of Ṽ EE uses much less information than the estimation of V e :
specifically, it only uses information in the EE transitions, whereas V e also uses information in
the EN E transitions (this information is necessary to estimate the value of nonemployment, which
is necessary to estimate the offer distribution). Since Table 3 shows that EE transitions account
for only 40% of all transitions, it is not surprising that when we move from Ṽ EE to V e that the
estimation becomes less noisy.
62

The levels of the true values vary across simulations because the weights are stochastic. To be specific, even
though the set of true V e and Ψ are fixed across simulation runs, the randomness in which firms end up in the
connected set generates variation in firm size because I only keep person-years in which the worker reappears in the
dataset.

Notes: This table reports Monte Carlo simulations of the estimation procedure. The table reports statistics across 100 simulation runs.
The left-hand side reports simulations where I have drawn one-in-10 random sample; the middle panel reports a one-in-20 random sample
and the right-hand side reports one-in-200 random sample. Because the bootstrap is very computationally expensive, I only report the
bootstrap results for the one-in-200 sample. Panel A reports statistics on the gap between the true minus the estimated value, while
Panel B reports statistics on the correlation between the true and estimated values. The interpretation of a positive number in Panel A
is that the estimation procedure underestimates the true relationship. The definitions and procedures are the same as in Table 4.

Appendix: Other model-consistent approaches to ranking firms

The first approach looks at worker inflows and ranks firms based on the share of hires that are on
employer-to-employer transitions. Bagger and Lentz (2016, pg. 21) term this ratio the “poaching
index.” Formally, the observed poaching index is:
P
o
k∈E\i Mkj
o
P Rj = P
(A92)
o .
k∈E∪n\j Mjk
The model-consistent version focuses on the endogenous flows:
P
k∈E\j Mkj
m
P Rj = P
.
k∈E∪n\j Mjk

(A93)

Result 4. If the value of nonemployment (V n ) is low enough relative to the distribution of the
value of employment (Vje ), then P Rjm is monotonically increasing in firm value.
Proof. It is easier to work with a monotone transformation of the poaching index and look at the
ratio of hires on employer-to-employer transitions, and consider employer-to-employer flows from a
firm to itself:

Hence, for small enough V n equation (A100) is positive for all exp(Vje ) so that P Rjm is increasing
in exp(Vje ).
The intuition of the result is that “better firms hire from better firms,” where nonemployment
is viewed as an exceptionally bad firm.
The second approach looks at worker outflows and ranks firms based on the separation rate.
This approach follows a long tradition in the inter-industry wage differential literature of using a
survey-based measure of the quit rate as a measure of desirability (e.g., Ulman (1965, Table III)
and Krueger and Summers (1988, Table IX)). The model offers several ways of operationalizing
this idea, which hinges on how to interpret the survey response of “quit.” One possibility is to
interpret this as all EE transitions, which gives rise to the following pair of definitions:
P
P
o
k∈E\j Mkj
k∈E\j Mkj
o
m
QRj (EE) =

(A102)

Alternatively, the quit rate could be interpreted as all separations, which gives rise to the following
pair of definitions:
P

k∈E∪n\j Mkj

QRj (ALL) =

(A103)
gj W
(1 − δ)(1 − ρ)gj W
Result 5. QRj (ALL)m and QRj (EE)m are monotonically decreasing in Vje .
Proof. EE quit rate: The probability of an EE quit is given by (for simplicity, this includes the
probability of a worker at firm j quitting to firm j):
QRj (EE)m = λ1

Hence, QRj (EE)m is decreasing in exp(Vje ).
EN quit rate: The probability of an EN quit is given by:
QRj (EN )m = (1 − λ1 )

Hence, QRj (EN )m is decreasing in exp(Vje ).
All quit rate: This result follows form combining the previous two results.
The intuition of the result is that because workers at all firms face the same offer distribution
and, in expectation, value all firms the same way, the probability of choosing to leave is decreasing
in the quality of the firm.

Solving this equation requires two objects that are not required to solve for Vje : β and f˜. I set
β = 0.95 (reflecting the annual frequency of the model), and I set f˜ = f. If there were no variation
in δj and ρj across j, then vj is just a monotone transformation of Vje since the first two terms
do not vary in Vje and the second two terms are monotone increasing in Vje . With variation in
δj and ρj , then this equivalence breaks. Nonetheless, the correlation between Vje and vj is 0.937.
Similarly, the correlation between vj and Ψj is 0.573 (because it is computationally expensive to
compute vj , I did not compute this quantity in each bootstrap repetition and so this should be
compared to the “raw” correlation between Vje and Ψj , which is 0.530.)

Notes: All counts are rounded to the nearest thousand. Row 2 divided by row 3 is 1.215. The
first row shows the total number of person-year-employer observations that are continuous quarter
or full-quarter among workers in the relevant age range. The second row shows the number of
person-year-employer observations where the person’s dominant job in the particular year passes
an earnings test. The third row goes down to the unique employer that provides the worker’s
“dominant” job, or the employer from which the worker made the most in the calendar year.

First, γ = E[ι] ≈ 0.577... is Euler’s constant. Second, the conditional expectation of ι is related to the choice
probability in the following way, where the two choices are a and b: E[ιa |a] = γ − ln(Pr(a  b)).

Notes: Sample counts are rounded to the nearest thousand. The data is at an annual frequency.
There is one observation per person per year. The observation is the job from which a person made
the most money, but only if she made at least $3, 250 (in $2011, using the CPI-U). Earnings are
annualized. The table includes person-years in which on December 31 the person was aged 18-61
(inclusive). EE is employer-to-employer. The sample is the same as column (3) of Table 1.

Notes: Panel A report average hours worked last week across sector pooling data from 2003-2007.
Columns (1) through (3) uses the monthly CPS. Column (1) reproduces the weighted average
of the published BLS Annual Average tables (Table 21). The BLS tables are more aggregated
than the sector level, and so the numbers are copied where two sectors are joined (for example,
“education” and “health and social” are aggregated). Column (2) replicates column (1) using the
micro-data. Column (3) disaggregates the sectors that were combined in columns (1) and (2), and
adds in agricultural workers. Columns (4) through (7) use the March CPS. Column (4) imposes the
same sample restrictions as in columns (2) and (3). Column (5) adds sample restrictions following
Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008) in terms of dropping imputed observations and observations with
extreme earnings. Column (6) restricts to men and women aged 18-61. Finally, column (7) imposes
an earnings floor of $3250 a year (in $2011). Panel B reports the relationship between estimated
sectoral compensating differentials reported in Figure 6b and measures of the variation in hours
worked across sectors reported in each column in Panel A. The R2 comes from a regression of the
sectoral compensating differentials on the the hours reported in the relevant column, where the
observations are weighted by the sectoral sum of the relevant person weights.

Figure A3: Event studies of earnings changes

Notes: This figure shows the mean wages of workers who change jobs and held the preceeding job
for two or more years, and the new job for two or more years. “Job” refers to the dominant annual
job. Each job is classified into quartiles based on the estimated firm effects in Table 1 column (3).
