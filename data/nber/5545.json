    "abstract": "\n\nIn a 1991 essay in Scientific American, Michael Porter suggested that environmental regulation may have a positive effect on the performance of domestic firms relative to their foreign competitors, by stimulating domestic innovation.  We examine the stylized facts regarding environmental expenditures and innovation in a panel of manufacturing industries.  We find that lagged environmental compliance expenditures have significant positive effect on R&D expenditures when we control for unobserved industry-specific effects.  We find little evidence, however, that industries' inventive output (as measured by patent applications) is related to compliance costs).\n\n",
