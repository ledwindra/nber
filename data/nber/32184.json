    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a unified theory of asset price determination encompassing both \u201cconventional\u201d and \u201calternative\u201d asset classes (private equity, real estate, etc.). The model features disruption of old by young firms and skewness in the distribution of innovative rents among the young innovators. The relative size of asset classes, the dynamics of rich investors\u2019 wealth, and the returns of the various asset classes are jointly determined in equilibrium. Besides explaining the observed patterns of returns across asset classes, we analyze the theoretical properties of the most widely used performance-evaluation measure for alternative investments. We also provide connections between the growth of alternative investments, the dispersion of returns across investors, and the turnover inside the ranks of wealthy individuals.\n\n",
