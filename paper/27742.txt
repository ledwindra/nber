ABSTRACT
Social policy to limit interactions can slow the spread of infection, but this benefit comes at the
cost of reduced output. We solve an optimal control problem to choose the degree of interaction
to maximize an objective function that rewards output and penalizes excess deaths. Optimal
policy restricts the degree of interaction—permanently and perhaps substantially—but,
surprisingly, not so much as to eradicate the disease. This finding holds regardless of how much
weight the objective function places on excess deaths, provided the weight is finite. Complete
eradication is optimal only if achieved by science or medicine.

“It’s important to put this on the table: This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” Dr.
Michael Ryan, WHO, May 14, 2020
Efforts to fight the global COVID-19 pandemic comprise medical/scientific activities and
social policies. Medical/scientific activities include pursuit of therapies to accelerate recovery
and reduce the death rate among infected people, as well as development of a safe and
effective vaccine. Social policies aim to reduce the spread of the disease through shutdowns
of business and social activities, social distancing, wearing of face coverings, contact tracing
and quarantine. Such policies have had massive impacts on output and employment that
have led to bitter divisions about how aggressively to pursue these policies and when to relax
them.
As in the burgeoning economics literature, we treat medical/scientific efforts as exogenous
and focus on social policies. We use a version of the SIR model with vital dynamics and
excess deaths to provide the constraints in a planner’s optimal control problem.

As in

Alvarez et al. (2020), Piguillem and Shi (2020), and Acemoglu et al. (2020), the planner’s
objective function rewards output and penalizes excess deaths. The key tradeoff facing the
planner is that increased interaction leads to more output, but also more deaths from the
disease. We characterize the optimal solution of this problem and compare it to the outcome
of a “laissez-faire” economy, an economy where the social interaction rate is chosen freely
by individuals, as in the optimization frameworks of Eichenbaum et al. (2020) and Toxvaerd
(2020), or informally as in Cochrane (2020).
A surprising finding of our analysis is that even though it is feasible for the planner to
eradicate the disease by limiting interactions, it is not optimal to do so, even in the long
run. That is, the planner’s optimal policy leads to an endemic equilibrium. Remarkably,
this finding holds no matter how large is the penalty on excess deaths. Nevertheless, it is
optimal for the planner to limit interactions until the random arrival of a cure and vaccine.
Moreover, the planner restricts interactions more than individuals would in a laissez-faire
economy.
Two features distinguish our paper from existing economics literature on pandemics.
1

First, by using versions of the SIR model in which there is no entry in the pool of susceptible
people, existing papers (including all of the work cited above, as well as Atkeson (2020),
Berger et al. (2020), and Fernandez-Villaverde and Jones (2020)) preclude the possibility of
endemic equilibria in which the infection share remains positive even in the long run. We
overcome this problem by including vital dynamics (births and non-disease deaths) to allow replenishment of the pool of susceptible people, thus opening the possibility of endemic
equilibria. (Alternatively, we could specify that recovered people lose their immunity after
a period of time and become susceptible, which would also open the possibility of endemic
equilibria.) Second, our analysis produces robust theoretical results that do not depend on
specific parameter values, unlike the papers above that typically1 rely on numerical simulations, which, of course, depend on specific parameter values.

SIR Model with Population Growth and Excess Deaths

The total population, N , is the sum of susceptible people, S, infected people, I, and recovered
people, R, who are no longer susceptible to the disease. Let φ > 0 be the birth rate per
unit of population per unit of time, µ ≥ 0 be the baseline death rate per unit of population
per unit of time, γ > 0 be the recovery rate per infected person per unit of time and
δ > 0 be the excess death rate of infected people per unit of time. As in conventional SIR
epidemiological models, the flow of new infections per unit of time is βS NI , where β > 0
is a contagion parameter reflecting the extent of social and professional interactions. In
this section we treat β as a fixed parameter. From section 2 onward, we treat beta as a
time-varying, choice variable.
The differential equations governing the evolution of S, I, and R are

which generalizes the basic reproduction rate in a conventional SIR model. R0 depends on
the endogenous growth rate g, so it is endogenous. R0 plays a pivotal role in determining
whether the long-run equilibrium of the economy is a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) with a
zero measure of infected people or an endemic equilibrium (EE) with a positive measure of
infected people.

Steady-State Equilibria

In a steady state, S, I, R, and N all grow at the rate g, so s, i, and r are constant and
equal s∗ , i∗ , and r∗ , respectively.

Throughout, an asterisk (*) denotes steady-state values

of variables. In a steady state, the rates of change of the population shares in (5) - (7) are
zero. In a DFE steady state, s∗ = 1 and i∗ = r∗ = 0, so (4) implies that the population
growth rate is g ∗ = φ − µ.
1.1.1.

An EE Steady State

An EE steady state has strictly positive values of s∗ , i∗ , and r∗ .
Proposition 1 If R0∗ ≥ 1, then

Thus, the steady state is DFE with s∗ = 1, i∗ = r∗ = 0 and Statements 1 - 3 are satisfied.
Case II: R0∗ > 1. Assume that the steady state is DFE. In the neighborhood of i = 0 and

Corollary 1 A steady state will be an EE if and only if R0∗ > 1.
Proof of Corollary 1.

From Proposition 1, if R0∗ > 1, then i∗ > 0, so the steady state

is EE. If R0∗ = 1, Proposition 1 implies that s∗ = 1 and i∗ = r∗ = 0, so the steady state is
DFE. If R0∗ < 1, then

di

in (6) equals zero if and only if i∗ = 0, so the steady state is DFE.

Proposition 2 If β > βc , then
1. R0∗ > 1, so the steady state is EE
2. the steady-state adjusted growth rate, Γ∗ ≡ g ∗ + µ, is the positive root of q (Γ) ≡
(β − δ) Γ2 + [(β − δ) (δ + γ) − φβ] Γ − γφβ = 0.
Sketch of Proof of Proposition 2. See Appendix B, which rewrites the inequality in (11)
as a quadratic function of Γ∗ and shows that one root of that function satisfies (8).

5

Remark 1 If the birth rate, φ, equals 0, then the roots of q (Γ) = 0 are 0 and − (δ + γ), so
Γ∗ = 0. Therefore, Statement 2 of Proposition 1 implies that i∗ = 0 and the steady state is
DFE, even if R0∗ > 1. As stated in the introduction, if there is no replenishment of the pool
of susceptible people, the steady state cannot be endemic.
Corollary 2 If β ≤ βc then
1. the steady state adjusted growth rate is Γ∗ = φ
2. R0∗ ≤ 1, so the steady state is DFE.
Proof of Corollary 2. From the proof of Proposition 2, q (φ) = (β − βc ) δφ. If β = βc ,
then q (φ) = 0, and therefore Γ∗ = φ. If β < βc , then q (φ) < 0, and since q (Γ∗ ) is convex,
the positive root of q (Γ∗ ) = 0 is greater than φ, which violates the inequality in (8).

In

this case, Γ∗ = φ, which satisfies inequalities (B.1) in the proof of Proposition 2 and (8);
∗

therefore i∗ = − Γ δ−φ = 0.
Proposition 3 If β > βc , then i∗0 (β) > 0.
Proof of Proposition 3. Since the quadratic function q (Γ) is linear in β, it can be written
as q (Γ) = −δΓ2 − δ (δ + γ) Γ + β dq(Γ)
. Thus q (Γ∗ ) = 0 implies
dβ

dq(Γ∗ )
dβ

= (Γ∗ + δ + γ) βδ Γ∗ =

The following Proposition provides a simple upper bound on i∗ that holds for both EE
and DFE steady states.
Proposition 4 0 ≤ i∗ <

Proof of Proposition 4. If β > βc , then R0∗ > 1 and Statement 2 of Proposition 1 implies
i∗ <

Γ∗
γ+Γ∗

φ
γ+φ

< 1. If β ≤ βc , then from Corollary 2, the steady state is DFE so i∗ = 0.

The quantitative analysis in Section 5 uses φ = 0.015 and γ = 12, so Proposition 4
implies i∗ <

φ
γ+φ

= 0.0012. Remarkably, this upper bound holds for any finite value of the

contagion parameter β, even arbitrarily large values.

Effect of Public Health Policy on Output

Public health policies aimed at reducing the contagion parameter β, such as those designed
to restrict interaction, can reduce aggregate output. In this section, we specify output as a
function of β.
Define zs as an index of a susceptible person’s social and productive interactions.

A

susceptible person’s effective labor is strictly increasing in zs for zs < z and is constant for
z ≥ z. The contagion parameter β is strictly increasing in zs , so we can write effective labor
per susceptible worker as e (β) with e0 (β) > 0 for β < β and e0 (β) ≡ 0 for β ≥ β, where β
is the value of β when zs = z.
Recovered people are not susceptible to the disease, so they do not restrain interactions

below z. Therefore, zr = z and a recovered person’s effective labor is e β .
We assume that infected people are not engaged in production, so the total amount of

effective labor in the economy is L = Se (β) + Re β .
As an example,2 we assume that aggregate output equals AL, where A is the productivity

of an effective unit of labor. Therefore, output per capita is A NL = A se (β) + re β , which
we write as

Y (β, s, r) = sy (β) + ry β ,

(12)



where y (β) ≡ Ae (β) is the output per susceptible person and y β ≡ Ae β is output per
recovered person. Differentiating Y (β, s, r) yields
Yβ (β, s, r) = sy 0 (β) ≥ 0

(13)


Ys (β, s, r) = y (β) ≤ y β = Yr (β, s, r) .

The inequalities in (13) and (14) hold with equality if and only if β = β.

Optimal β

As in Alvarez et al. (2020), we assume that there is a constant hazard of a “breakthrough
date,” denoted T , when medical therapies lead to complete and instantaneous recovery of all
infected people and a vaccine prevents any new infections, so that the disease is completely
eradicated. The recovery rate, γ, and the excess death rate, δ, remain constant until T ;
from T onward, i = 0, g (i) = φ − µ, and optimal β = β. Therefore,

ensure that Ve is finite, assume that

(16)

Before T , the optimal time path of β balances the benefit of reducing β in terms of
reducing excess deaths against the cost of reducing β in terms of lost output. This tradeoff

and
(ρ + µ + p) Vr = Yr .

(22)

In (20), the effective discount rate on the left side is ρ + µ + p. As in models of uncertain
lifetimes going back to Yaari (1965), the effective discount rate includes the rate of pure time
preference, ρ, and the instantaneous hazard rate of death. Here, the hazard rate of death is
the baseline death rate, µ, plus the hazard rate that T will arrive, terminating the regime in
which the disease is present. Thus, the left side of (20) is the required return associated with
9

increasing s by one unit. It is equated with the expected return on the right side, which
consists of the output Ys produced by an additional unit of s and the change in valuation
reflecting: (1) the passage of time,

dVs
,
dt

and (2) the increased hazard of becoming infected,

βi, multiplied by the change in valuation, Vi − Vs , as a person moves from susceptible to
infected. The interpretation of (22) is similar except there is no term reflecting the change
in health status because there are no transitions to susceptibility or infected status from the
recovered status.
The interpretation of (21) is more complicated. On the left side, the effective discount
rate, ρ + µ + p + δ, includes δ because a unit increase in i increases excess deaths by δ. The
first three terms on the right side are similar to the terms on the right side of (20): The first
term reflects that a unit increase in i increases deaths by δ, which reduces the flow of welfare
by ωδ; the second term,

dVi
,
dt

captures the change in Vi with the passage of time; and the

third term, γ (Vr − Vi ), is the hazard rate γ of switching from status i to status r, multiplied
by the change in valuation, Vr − Vi , associated with that change. The fourth term reflects
that a unit increase in i reduces the population change by δN , reducing the aggregate flow

∂
R
of utility by δ ∂N
N V NS , NI , N
, which equals3 δ [V − (sVs + iVi + rVr )]. The fifth term,
− (Vs − Vi ) βs, reflects an important externality, namely, that an increase in the infection
share i increases by βs the hazard rate that a susceptible person will become infected. The
planner takes account of this externality by including the change in welfare associated with
this new infection − (Vs − Vi ) multiplied by βs.
The first-order condition for optimal β is
Yβ (β, s, r) = (Vs − Vi ) si.

(23)

The left side of (23), Yβ (β, s, r), is the marginal benefit of increasing β, which is the increase
in per-capita output facilitated by an increase in β. The right side of (23) is the marginal
cost of increasing β. A unit increase in β increases the infection rate by si, which reduces
s by si units and increases i by si units, causing V (s, i, r) to fall by (Vs − Vi ) si.

3.1

Steady State Under Optimal Policy

Let β ∗ denote the steady-state value of β under the optimal policy.
Lemma 1 If β ∗ ≥ βc ≡ δ + γ + φ, then Vs∗ − Vi∗ is positive and finite.
Sketch of Proof of Lemma 1. The full proof of Lemma 1 in Appendix B uses the steadystate versions of (20), (21), and (22) and shows that if Vs∗ − Vi∗ ≤ 0, then β ∗ = β. That
proof shows that if β ∗ = β, then Vs∗ − Vi∗ > 0, thereby contradicting Vs∗ − Vi∗ ≤ 0.
Lemma 1 helps prove the following proposition.
Proposition 5 If β ≥ βc ≡ δ + γ + φ, and ω > 0 is finite, then under the optimal policy,
the steady state is EE.
Proof of Proposition 5. Suppose that, contrary to what is to be proved, the steady state
under optimal policy is DFE, so that s∗ = 1 and i∗ = r∗ = 0. Therefore, since Vs∗ − Vi∗ > 0
is finite (Lemma 1), the marginal cost of β, (Vs∗ − Vi∗ ) s∗ i∗ , equals zero. Since Yβ > 0 for
β < β, the first-order condition for β in (23) implies that β ∗ ≥ β > βc , which implies that
i∗ > 0. Therefore, the steady state under optimal policy cannot be DFE and hence is EE.

The first-order condition in (23) along with Yβ β, s∗ , r∗ = 0 and (Vs − Vi ) s∗ i∗ > 0 in
an EE steady state imply
Corollary 3 If β ≥ βc ≡ δ + γ + φ and ω > 0 is finite, then β ∗ < β.

Laissez Faire

In the absence of centralized policy to control β, individual susceptible people may choose
to limit their interactions to reduce their own risks of becoming infected.

Consider the

decision of a susceptible person, who knows that in the future she may become infected and
subsequently may recover from the disease.
recovered stage of life.

Using backward induction, first consider the

person’s earnings until the time of her death, or the arrival of T , whichever comes first, is
v R and satisfies

(ρ + µ + p) v r = y β .

(24)

For an infected person, the effective discount rate, ρ + µ + δ + p, includes the hazard
rate, δ, that the person dies from the disease. Let v I be the value of being in the infected
state. The instantaneous flow of welfare, −ωδ, and the hazard-weighted change in value

when recovering from the disease, γ v R − v I , satisfy

(ρ + µ + δ + p) v I = −ωδ + γ v R − v I .

where, unlike v I and v R , v S is not constant. It depends on the aggregate infection share, i,
which evolves over time. The first-order condition for the maximization in (26) is

y 0 (β) = i v S − v I .

(27)

Now compare an individual’s v R , v I , and v S with the derivatives of the planner’s value

function Vr , Vi , and Vs , respectively. Comparing (24) with (22) and noting that Yr = y β ,
implies that v R = Vr . Similarly, noting that Ys = y (β) and Yβ = sy 0 (β) shows that (20) has
the same form as (26) and the first-order condition (23) has the same form as (27), where
Vs corresponds to v S and Vi corresponds to v I .
The optimal values of β in the two problems differ because the expression for v I in (25)
has a different form than the expression for Vi in (21). The last two terms on the right side of
(21) have no counterpart in (25). In addition, the solution Vi of the ODE (21) is a function

12

of time, while the solution of (25) is a time-invariant, constant v I . Because v I differs from
Vi , the laissez-faire choice of β differs from the planner’s choice so welfare can be improved
by mandating β rather than relying on individual precaution.
The two terms on the right side of (21) that are responsible for the discrepancy between
Vi and v I are δ [V − (sVs + iVi + rVr )], and (Vs − Vi ) βs. The first term is related to the fact
that the planner takes into account the impact of i on population growth. The second term,
(Vs − Vi ) βs, reflects an important externality, as discussed earlier. An infected individual
does not internalize the contagion of her infection, while the planner does. This externality
is the fundamental reason that public health policy is useful.

Quantitative Behavior Along the Transition Path

This section presents a quantitative illustration of transition paths. We set φ = 0.015, which
is the sum of the annual birth and net immigration rates, and µ = 0.01, the annual death
rate in the United States.4 The values of disease-related parameters are based on the US
experience with Covid-19. We set γ = 12 to reflect that the average person who recovers
was infected for about one month. We set δ = 0.01γ = 0.12 to reflect that infected people
are about 1% as likely to die from the disease as to recover from it. Therefore, the critical
value βc ≡ δ + γ + φ = 12.135. To calibrate β, we use (9) and the fact that δi is so much
smaller than βc to obtain β = (δ + γ + φ − δi) R0 ≈ βc R0 , where R0 is the maximal value
of R0 observed at the beginning of the pandemic before any individual actions or any public
health policies to reduce contagion. We use the high end of estimates for R0 across US states
in the last week of February 2020 and set R0 = 3.5, which implies β = 42.473.5 The value
of the discount rate used by the planner and by individuals, ρ, is set to 0.03.

was approximately the value of the reproductive rate for most states during the second quarter of 2020. We set ∆ = 0.09 to match the 9% drop in output in that quarter. Therefore,

To calibrate ω we use the concept of “Quality Adjusted Life Year” (QALY), defined as the
value of extending quality life by an extra year. The World Health Organization consensus is
that QALY is 1 - 3 annual GDP per capita.6 Using a discount rate of ρ + µ = 0.03 + 0.01 to
discount the foregone stream of 1 QALY per year over the lost years of life implies that the
present value of the losses from an excess death is 25 QALY. Assigning a value of 2 times

GDP per capita to each QALY implies ω = 50 times GDP per capita. With y β = 1, we
set ω equal to 50.7
Finally, i0 , the infection share of the population on the initial day of our simulation
(March 1), is chosen so that the daily excess death count implied by the model matches the
daily Covid-related deaths observed three weeks later (March 22). This calibration implies

With δ = 0.12, i0 = 0.0025.

To interpret data on the reproduction rate, we distinguish the basic reproduction rate at
time t, R0,t ≡

γ+φ+Γt

from the effective reproduction rate at time t, Rt,t ≡

βt st

is st R0,t , the product of the susceptible share of the population and the basic reproduction
rate. Using Rt,t , (6) can be written as
di
= (Rt,t − 1) (δ + γ + µ + g) i.

(28)

Therefore, the sign of Rt,t − 1 determines whether the infection share, it , is increasing or
decreasing; in contrast, the sign of R0∗ − 1 determines whether the steady state is EE or
DFE, where R0∗ is the steady-state value of R0,t . Since available data typically refer to the
effective reproduction rate, Rt,t , we will focus on that measure in Figure 1. However, near

Alvarez et al. (2020), citing Hall et al. (2020), set ω = 20, but note that this value “is on the low range of
the estimates in the literature.” Our fundamental result that optimal policy leads to an endemic equilibrium
holds for any positive value of ω.

the beginning of an epidemic of a new disease, st is very close to one, so the distinction
between R0,t and Rt,t is virtually immaterial.
In Figure 1, the optimal policy scenario (OP) shows the value of Rt,t when the contagion
parameter βt is the socially optimal value determined by the first-order condition in (23)
at each point of time.

The laissez-faire scenario (LF) shows the value of Rt,t when the

contagion parameter βt is the laissez-faire value determined by the first-order condition in
(27) at each point of time. Figure 1 also shows data that are estimates of Rt,t for the 50
individual US states.8 The most notable feature of Figure 1 is that scenario OP exhibits
more aggressive policy to fight the disease than scenario LF. Specifically, the values of Rt,t ,
which reflect values of βt , are lower in scenario OP than in scenario LF. In particular, during
the first 4-6 weeks, Rt,t is substantially smaller than one in scenario OP and is substantially
higher than one in scenario LF.
Figure 2 shows that under scenario OP, daily excess deaths initially decline and continue
to decline throughout the 5 months shown.

In contrast, under scenario LF, daily excess

deaths spike upward abruptly, and after 2-3 months begin to decline very slowly. To illustrate
the quantitative difference under the two scenarios, we find that on May 1, daily excess deaths
are 114 under scenario OP and are 1501 under scenario LF. The data for nationwide daily
excess deaths in Figure 2 resemble scenario LF for the first 6 weeks. Thereafter, daily excess
deaths decline rapidly reflecting the effect of policies instituted by various states.

Concluding Remarks

Proposition 5 states that under the socially optimal policy, the steady state is an endemic
equilibrium with a strictly positive measure infection share i∗ . To avoid misunderstanding
this finding, it is important to understand what the proposition does not say.
First, the proposition does not imply that public health policies should be abandoned in
the steady state. On the contrary, Corollary 3 states that in the steady state, the optimal
value of β is less than β, which requires restraint on interaction.
8

Source: http://rt.live. Data from http://epiforecasts.io imply quantitatively similar values.

15

Second, since the steady state under optimal policy is EE, R0∗ > 1 in the steady state.
However, consistent with the comment regarding Corollary 3, R0∗ is less than its unfettered
value, and may, for high values of ω be close to one.
Third, though R0 is greater than one in the steady state, its optimal value can be smaller
than one for a period of time along the transition path to the steady state. In the quantitative
example in Section 5, socially optimal policy immediately decreases R0,t to 0.22. The steadystate value of i∗ is small, implying δi∗ = 0.006%, which — for a population of 330 million —
amounts to 19, 800 excess deaths annually.
Fourth, while Proposition 5 implies that it is not optimal to eradicate the disease solely
by reducing β, it leaves open the possibility that it is optimal to eradicate the disease by
developing an effective vaccine that is widely used by the population.
Fifth, the finding that optimal policy does not reduce β enough to eradicate the disease
does not depend on the possibility of a medical breakthrough that eliminates the disease.
This finding prevails even if p = 0.
Sixth, the objective function in (17) treats deaths as the only harmful effect of the
disease, though many survivors of the disease may have serious health problems that linger
indefinitely. These non-fatal harmful effects can be incorporated into the objection function
by increasing the value of ω. Since Proposition 5 holds for arbitrarily large ω, increasing ω
will not change the result that under optimal policy, the steady state is EE.

Selected Proofs

Proof of Proposition 2. First, prove Γ∗ > 0. Inequality (11) can be written as
f (Γ∗ ) ≥ 0,

(B.1)

where f (z) ≡ z 2 + (γ + δ − φ) z − γφ. Since f 00 (z) > 0 and f (0) = −φγ < 0, the quadratic
equation f (z) = 0 has two real roots, z1 < 0 < z2 . Therefore, Γ∗ satisfies (B.1) if and only if
Γ∗ < z1 or Γ∗ > z2 . Observe that f (φ − δ) = (φ − δ)2 + (γ + δ − φ) (φ − δ) − φγ = −γδ < 0
so z1 < φ − δ and hence Γ∗ < z1 violates (11). Observe that f (φ) = φ2 + (γ + δ − φ) φ − φγ
= δφ > 0 so that z2 < φ.

Therefore, Γ∗ ∈ [z2 , φ] satisfies inequalities (B.1) and (11) so

Γ∗ > 0.
(Statement 1) The definition of R0∗ in (9) and the steady-state growth rate g ∗ = φ−µ−δi∗
imply that R0∗ =

(Statement 2) To calculate Γ∗ when R0∗ ≥ 1, set

Then subtract both sides of this equation from the

corresponding sides of Statement 2 in Proposition 1 and use the definitions of Γ∗ and R0 to
obtain the quadratic equation9 q (Γ∗ ) ≡ (β − δ) Γ∗2 + [(β − δ) (δ + γ) − φβ] Γ∗ − γφβ = 0.
Since β > βc > δ, q (β) is convex and since q (0) = −γφβ < 0, q (Γ) = 0 has two distinct
real roots Γ1 < 0 < Γ2 .

Since Γ∗ > 0, ignore Γ1 < 0.

to prove q (φ) > 0 since q (0) < 0.

To prove that Γ2 < φ, it suffices

Evaluate q (φ) = [(β − δ) (φ + δ + γ) − φβ − γβ] φ =

[−δ (φ + δ + γ) + βδ] φ = (β − βc ) δφ > 0.
∗
Proof of Lemma 1. First prove that det M33
> 0 is finite.

∗
Since all four elements of M33

are finite and since ρ + µ + p + β ∗ i∗ > 0 and −β ∗ i∗ ≤ 0, it suffices to prove (a) (β ∗ − δ) s∗ ≥ 0
and (b) ρ + µ + p + δ + γ − δi∗ − β ∗ s∗ > 0. The assumption β ∗ ≥ βc ≡ δ + γ + φ implies
β ∗ − δ ≥ γ + φ > 0 which proves (a). To prove (b), consider two separate cases: (i) i∗ = 0
and (ii) i∗ > 0.

In case (i), i∗ = 0 implies β ∗ ≤ βc , which together with the assumption

β ∗ ≥ βc implies that β ∗ = βc . Therefore, since s∗ = 1, ρ + µ + p + δ + γ − δi∗ − β ∗ s∗ ≥
ρ + µ + p + δ + γ − βc = ρ + p − (φ − µ) > 0. In case (ii), setting

di
