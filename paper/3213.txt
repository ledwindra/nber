LONGITUDINAL PATTERNS OF COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS IN
THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
ABSTRACT
Ve examine the impact of OSHA enforcement on company compliance with
agency regulations in the manufacturing sector, with a unique plant-level
dataset of inspection and compliance behavior during 1972-1983, the first
twelve years of the agency operation. The analysis suggests that, for an
individual inspected plant, the average effect of OSHA inspections during
this period was to reduce expected citations by 3.0 or by .36 s.d. The
total effect on expected citations of additional inspections can be
decomposed into two parts; evaluated at the mean of the sample, 59 percent
of the total change in citations occurred due to an increase in the
compliance rate; 41 percent was due to a reduction in citations among
continuing violators.
