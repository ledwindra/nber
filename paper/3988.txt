             II. ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE CONTEXT
           OF THE ECONOMYWIDE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN

       The electric utility industxy is a prime culprit in the economywide post-1973
productivity growth slowdown. As shown in Table 1, growth in labor productivity (output

per hour) in the electric utility industry proceeded at a rate triple that of the aggregate

economy from 1899 to 1948, and at a rate 2.5 times as fast from 1948 to 1973. After 1973,

however, the previously rapid rate of advance for electric utilities caine screeching to a halt,

as productivity growth slowed to the same low rate as experienced by the aggregate

economy.

       Table 1 also displays the growth rate of the real price of electricity over the same

time intervals. Here the rate of improvement decelerated sharply immediately after World

War II, and the historical decline in the real price was replaced by an increase after 1973.

        While the electric generating industry is appealing as a subject for study, our

regressions cover an extremely small fraction of U. S. employment and bear on only a smnll

fraction of the total U. S. productivity growth puzzle. A second qualification is that the

electric utility industry has entered a relatively "mature" phase of the industry growth cycle,

and thus it may not be surprising that its productivity growth would decline over time.

 Thus the higher the heat rate, the more fuel is being consumed in the production of a given

 amount of electricity, and the less efficient is the generation process. The heat rate moves

 inversely to a companion ratio called "thermal efficiency."




      2. This verdict is qualified by Hirsch (1989, p.71), who argues that 'to explain progress in electric power
 technològy simply as a result of research and development performed by manufacturers would be one-sided and
 misleadin&" The other side of technical advance is achieved by utility management, 67 percent of which in 1964
 consisted of trained engineers. Managers in particular companiesperceived themselves ascompeting for the role
 of technological leadership and constantly pressed equipment manufacturers to achieve technical advances, taking
 the risk that unproved technology would be successfuL However, this role of management is not counted as
  research and development (R&D) by normal accounting methods, and Hirsch himself reports that utility-funded
  R&D in 1970 amounted to only 0.23 percent of gross revenues.

increase beyond 250 megawatts. Indeed, after increasing from 3 percent in 1880 to 22 percent in 1947, thermal
efficiency leveled off at about 33 percent in the late 1950s and showed no change after than (Hirsch, 1989, Figure

the slowdown in labor productivity growth and decline in thermal efficiency experienced by

utilities, as regulations induced a shift away from soft coal, required major capital
expenditures for scrubbers and other devices, and substantially raised the requirement for

maintenance employees. Thus productivity growth was impeded after the early 1970s by

both the technological plateau and by environmental regulation, introducing a serious
identification problem for any study attempting to explain the productivity growth slowdown.

 percent for equipment shipped in 1965.69 to 2 percent in 1975-80 to 0.5 percent in 1980-84.

Christensen-Greene (1976). A dissenting opinion is offered by Gollop-Roberts (1981, p. 120), who argue that
"producers make input decisions on the basis of technical and market conditions facing the complete system, not
isolated plants.' However, when plant data are available, there is no reason to make this choie ex ante, as
aggregation issues can be studied explicitly by estimating firm and establishment effects, as in Table 12 below.

in (2).14 The Bushe equation omits vintage effects and instead uses design data to divide

up the total sample into seven technically homogeneous cells, and the coefficients in
equation (4) are separately for each cell. The log-linear functional form of our specification

(2) is shared with (4). In contrast, in (3) Wills begins with a linear form but allows for

interaction effects and normalizes by capacity. Bushe also implicitly normalizes by capacity,

since the average capacity within his seven separate cells differs by several orders of

magnitude.

       A basic difference between the three specifications is the allowance for both time and

vintage effects in (2), only vintage effects in (3) and only "cell' effects in (4). The vintage

variable is included in (2) but not in (3), because the latter includes observations only for

newly installed plants, whereas the former includes observations for each year of operation.

The Bushe approach in (4) appears to be inconsistent, in that data for multiple years of

    14. The two dummy variables in the Wills equation are for presence of coal burning and of more than one
unit, and in the Bushe equation the single dummy variable represents the presence of coal burning.

in (2).14 The Bushe equation omits vintage effects and instead uses design data to divide

up the total sample into seven technically homogeneous cells, and the coefficients in
equation (4) are separately for each cell. The log-linear functional form of our specification

(2) is shared with (4). In contrast, in (3) Wills begins with a linear form but allows for

interaction effects and normalizes by capacity. Bushe also implicitly normalizes by capacity,

since the average capacity within his seven separate cells differs by several orders of

magnitude.

       A basic difference between the three specifications is the allowance for both time and

vintage effects in (2), only vintage effects in (3) and only "cell' effects in (4). The vintage

variable is included in (2) but not in (3), because the latter includes observations only for

newly installed plants, whereas the former includes observations for each year of operation.

The Bushe approach in (4) appears to be inconsistent, in that data for multiple years of

    14. The two dummy variables in the Wills equation are for presence of coal burning and of more than one
unit, and in the Bushe equation the single dummy variable represents the presence of coal burning.

        The earlier studies are surveyed by Cowing and Smith (1978).

        Among these studies are Atkinson and Halvorsen (1984), Gollop and Roberts (1981, 1983), Cowing.
Small and Stevenson (1981), and Christensen and Greene (1976). The advantages of plant over &m data are
discussed by Cowing and Smith (1978), pp. 175.7, with reference to the papers by Nerlove (1963) and
Christensen-Greene (1976). A dissenting opinion is offered by Gollop-Roberts (1981, p. 120), who argue that
"producers make input decisions on the basis of technical and market conditions facing the complete system, not
isolated plants.' However, when plant data are available, there is no reason to make this choie ex ante, as
aggregation issues can be studied explicitly by estimating firm and establishment effects, as in Table 12 below.

the slowdown in labor productivity growth and decline in thermal efficiency experienced by

utilities, as regulations induced a shift away from soft coal, required major capital
expenditures for scrubbers and other devices, and substantially raised the requirement for

maintenance employees. Thus productivity growth was impeded after the early 1970s by

both the technological plateau and by environmental regulation, introducing a serious
identification problem for any study attempting to explain the productivity growth slowdown.

increase beyond 250 megawatts. Indeed, after increasing from 3 percent in 1880 to 22 percent in 1947, thermal
efficiency leveled off at about 33 percent in the late 1950s and showed no change after than (Hirsch, 1989, Figure

 Thus the higher the heat rate, the more fuel is being consumed in the production of a given

 amount of electricity, and the less efficient is the generation process. The heat rate moves

 inversely to a companion ratio called "thermal efficiency."




      2. This verdict is qualified by Hirsch (1989, p.71), who argues that 'to explain progress in electric power
 technològy simply as a result of research and development performed by manufacturers would be one-sided and
 misleadin&" The other side of technical advance is achieved by utility management, 67 percent of which in 1964
 consisted of trained engineers. Managers in particular companiesperceived themselves ascompeting for the role
 of technological leadership and constantly pressed equipment manufacturers to achieve technical advances, taking
 the risk that unproved technology would be successfuL However, this role of management is not counted as
  research and development (R&D) by normal accounting methods, and Hirsch himself reports that utility-funded
  R&D in 1970 amounted to only 0.23 percent of gross revenues.

        While the electric generating industry is appealing as a subject for study, our

regressions cover an extremely small fraction of U. S. employment and bear on only a smnll

fraction of the total U. S. productivity growth puzzle. A second qualification is that the

electric utility industry has entered a relatively "mature" phase of the industry growth cycle,

and thus it may not be surprising that its productivity growth would decline over time.

             II. ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE CONTEXT
           OF THE ECONOMYWIDE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN

       The electric utility industxy is a prime culprit in the economywide post-1973
productivity growth slowdown. As shown in Table 1, growth in labor productivity (output

per hour) in the electric utility industry proceeded at a rate triple that of the aggregate

economy from 1899 to 1948, and at a rate 2.5 times as fast from 1948 to 1973. After 1973,

however, the previously rapid rate of advance for electric utilities caine screeching to a halt,

as productivity growth slowed to the same low rate as experienced by the aggregate

economy.

       Table 1 also displays the growth rate of the real price of electricity over the same

time intervals. Here the rate of improvement decelerated sharply immediately after World

War II, and the historical decline in the real price was replaced by an increase after 1973.
