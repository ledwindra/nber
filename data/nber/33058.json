    "abstract": "\n\nA number of papers have solved for the optimal dynamic portfolio strategy when expected returns are time-varying and trading is costly, but only for agents with myopic utility. Non-myopic agents benefit from hedging against future shocks to the investment opportunity set even when transaction costs are zero (Merton, 1969, 1971). In this paper, we propose a solution to the dynamic portfolio allocation problem for non-myopic agents faced with a stochastic investment opportunity set when trading is costly. We show that the agent\u2019s optimal policy is to trade toward an \u201caim\u201d portfolio, the makeup of which depends both on transaction costs and on each asset\u2019s correlation with changes in the investment opportunity set. The speed at which the agent should trade towards the aim portfolio depends both on the shock\u2019s persistence and on the extent to which the shock can be effectively hedged. We illustrate the differences in portfolio makeup that result from considering hedging demands of a long-horizon investor using a set of simplified examples, and using a daily trading strategy based on the estimated relation between retail order imbalance and future returns.\n\n",
