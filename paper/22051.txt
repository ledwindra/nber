ABSTRACT
We provide the first analysis of the relationship between economic conditions and the use of
illicit drugs other than marijuana. Drawing on US data from 2002-2013, we find mixed evidence
with regard to the cyclicality of illicit drug use. However, there is strong evidence that economic
downturns lead to increases in substance use disorders involving hallucinogens and prescription
pain relievers. These effects are robust to a variety of specification choices and are concentrated
among prime-age white males with low educational attainment. We conclude that the returns to
spending on the treatment of substance use disorders are particularly high during economic
downturns.

1. Introduction
The United States has recently experienced surges in the prevalence of
certain illicit drugs other than marijuana (henceforth illicit drugs), in particular the
non-medical use of prescription pain relievers and heroin. From 2001-2013, there
was a three-fold increase in overdose deaths involving prescription pain relievers
and a five-fold increase in overdose deaths involving heroin (NIDA 2015).
Although some observers have attributed these trends, at least in part, to the Great
Recession (Farrell 2009; Bernstein et al. 2014; Seelye 2014; Douthat 2015;
Mencimer 2015), research on this issue has been hindered by a lack of credible
data on illicit drug use at the state-year level. Instead, researchers have focused
on how economic conditions affect alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use,
information on which is more readily available.
The current study examines the relationship between economic conditions
and the use of illicit drugs such as analgesics (i.e., prescription pain relievers),
cocaine, and heroin. Our data source is the National Surveys on Drug Use and
Health (NSDUH), which are used to produce the primary estimates of substance
use and misuse in the United States (Muhuri et al. 2013).

Every year, the

NSDUH surveys almost 70,000 residents of the United States about their drug
consumption and other health behaviors (Morton et al. 2013). Pooling NSDUH
data from the years 2002-2013, we obtain a sample composed of over 800,000
respondents, which is critical for studying illicit drugs with very low rates of use.

1

Because the NSDUH questionnaire contains items specifically designed to
measure the symptoms of substance use disorder, we are able to study the effects
of economic conditions on a variety of clinically relevant outcomes related to
substance use disorders, which have been linked to premature mortality from HIV
and hepatitis infections, overdoses, suicide, and traffic fatalities (Degenhardt and
Hall 2012). 1 The NSDUH data also span the Great Recession of 2007-2008,
allowing us to explore how one of the most severe economic downturns in the
past century influenced the use and abuse of illicit drugs.
Documenting the relationship between economic conditions and the use of
illicit drugs is important for several reasons. First, theory does not provide clear
predictions with regard to how macroeconomic fluctuations relate to substance
use (Arkes 2011), and the results of previous studies have been mixed (Pabilonia
2014, Tekin et al. 2013). Second, public funding for drug treatment programs is
often at risk of being cut when state and local governments are faced with budget
shortfalls (Richman 2009; Dresser 2015; Keilman 2015; McNamara 2015).
Accurately predicting the consequences of such cuts requires a better
understanding of how economic conditions relate to substance use and abuse. 2
1

The NSDUH items designed to measure substance use disorder are described below and are
based on the criteria contained in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-4).
2
Accurately predicting the consequences of funding cuts to drug treatment programs also depends
upon knowing something about the effectiveness of these programs. Several well-designed
studies have concluded that treatment in both outpatient and residential programs leads to
substantial and long-lasting reductions in substance use (Hubbard et al. 1997; Simpson et al. 1999;
Gossop et al. 2003; Hser et al. 2004). Swensen (2015) uses county level information on substance

2

Third, there is evidence that deaths from accidental poisoning, or drug overdoses,
have become strongly countercyclical since the early 1980s (Ruhm 2015). Ruhm
(2015) argued that increased access to opioid analgesics coupled with recessioninduced mental health problems is likely responsible for this phenomenon, but
because of lack of data could not explore its causes. Below, we estimate the
relationship between economic conditions and the use of prescription pain
relievers such as OxyContin and Percocet, providing the first direct support for
Ruhm’s argument.
Using standard difference-in-differences models, we find that economic
downturns are associated with statistically significant increases in the use of
ecstasy and reductions in LSD use. Estimates of the relationship between state
economic conditions and use of drugs other than ecstasy or LSD are generally
inconclusive. Examining outcomes based on more clinically relevant measures of
substance use disorder, we find clear evidence that disorders involving analgesics
and hallucinogens are strongly countercyclical, substantial in terms of magnitude,
and concentrated among non-elderly adult white males with low educational
attainment. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that economic
downturns lead to increases in the use and abuse of illicit drugs and suggest that
the returns to state and local government spending to treat substance abuse
disorders are particularly high during economic downturns.

use treatment facility openings and closings and finds that increases in facilities significantly

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a
brief literature review, and section 3 describes the data and outlines the empirical
approach. Section 4 presents the results, and Section 5 discusses and concludes.

2. Literature Review
Our work builds upon a voluminous literature on how health behaviors
and health outcomes vary with economic conditions; we provide only a very brief
review here, as this work has been summarized elsewhere (Ruhm 2012, Cawley
and Ruhm 2012). Since Ruhm’s (2000) study showing that mortality in the
United States was strongly procyclical, researchers have extended this basic result
in several directions. For example, researchers have documented procyclical
mortality in other countries (Lin 2009; Gertdham and Ruhm 2006; Tapa Granado
2005) and have explored changes in the relationship between economic conditions
and mortality over time (Ruhm 2015). To examine mechanisms, researchers have
estimated the effects of macroeconomic conditions on health insurance coverage
(Cawley and Simon 2005; Cawley et al. 2015) and healthcare quality (Stevens et
al. 2015, forthcoming).

Researchers have also examined how risky health

behaviors such as poor diet and nutrition choices respond to macroeconomic
fluctuations (Colman and Dave 2014, forthcoming).

reduce drug-induced mortality rates.

4

A large number of studies have examined how alcohol consumption varies
with the macroeconomy, including methodologically sophisticated studies that
control for both time and geography-specific fixed effects. These studies identify
the effects of economic conditions by within-area (typically state) changes in the
unemployment rate. The broad pattern that emerges from pre-Great Recession
business cycles is that heavy drinkers consume less during economic downturns
while light drinkers consume more (see Dee 2001, Ruhm 1995, Ruhm and Black
2002, and others; for a recent review see Pacula 2011), although there are some
exceptions (Davalos et al. 2012).
Several recent studies have studied the relationship between economic
conditions and alcohol consumption using data from the Great Recession.
Drawing upon data Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data,
Bor et al. (2013) found that there was an increase in abstention from drinking
coupled with an increase in binge drinking during the period 2008-2009. Tekin et
al. (2013) also found evidence that binge drinking increased during the Great
Recession using BRFSS data, although they argued the effect was trivial in terms
of magnitude (that is, they argued that the actual incidence of binge drinking did
not increase by an economically significant amount). Finally, recent work by
Cotti et al. (2015, forthcoming) using household scanner data found that, among

5

households with any alcohol purchases, demand for packaged alcohol was
significantly procyclical during the Great Recession. 3
There have been far fewer studies examining the relationship between
economic conditions and illicit drug use, mainly due to the lack of data. In fact,
we are aware of only three studies that have examined this relationship using U.S.
data, all of which focused on youths and none of which examined specific illicit
drugs other than marijuana. 4 Pabilonia (2014) analyzed YRBS data on 15-17
year-olds for the period 2003-2011. She found little evidence of a relationship
between economic conditions and marijuana use among white respondents,
although there was a significant countercylical relationship among black males.
Arkes (2007, 2011) examined drug use among youths and young adults using data
from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). Controlling
for unobserved heterogeneity at the state level, he found that the use of marijuana
and illicit drugs among teenagers was strongly countercyclical. Among 20-24
year-olds, marijuana use appeared to be countercyclical, but the relationship
between economic conditions and illicit drugs was much weaker (Arkes 2011).

3

At least two studies have focused on the relationship between economic conditions and youth
drinking. Using Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data for the period 1991-2011, Argys et al.
(2014) found that drinking participation and binge drinking both increased during economic
downturns. In contrast, Pabilonia (2014) did not find evidence of counter cyclicality for drinking
among 15-17 year-olds using YRBS data for a shorter period (2003-2011).
4
We are only aware of one study that has examined economic conditions and drug use using nonU.S. data. Chalmers and Ritter (2011) focused on alcohol and cannabis use in Australia from
1991-2007. These authors found that economic downturns were positively related to the number
of youths who used cannabis as well as their frequency of use.

6

Data limitations did not permit Arkes to separately identify specific illicit
drugs, and the relevant question in the NLSY also explicitly excludes use of drugs
prescribed by physicians, which is of particular interest to public health officials
in light of the increase in prescription drug misuse. 5 As we will show below: 1)
the relationship between economic conditions and substance use differs markedly
across drug types; 2) the use of some drugs (e.g., LSD) is procyclical while use of
others is countercyclical (e.g., ecstasy), suggesting that an aggregate ‘any illicit
drug’ outcome could mask important relationships; and 3) there is a strong
relationship between economic conditions and prescription pain relievers that
likely would not be included in the NLSY measure. These patterns – along with
our disorder outcomes described in detail below – highlight the unique value of
the NSDUH data.
To summarize, while there are numerous well-designed studies that
evaluate the effects of economic conditions on alcohol consumption among both
adults and youths, there are only three studies that have examined population rates
of illicit drug use, all of which focused on teenagers or young adults and only one
of which used data spanning the Great Recession. 6 None of the prior work on
5

Specifically, individuals are asked: “Excluding cannabis and alcohol, since the date of the last
interview, have you used any drugs like cocaine or crack or heroin, or any other substance not
prescribed by a doctor, in order to get high or achieve an altered state?”
6
Maclean et al. (2013) used data from the Treatment Episodes Data Set (TEDS) for the period
1992-2010 to examine the relationship between economic conditions and admissions to specialty
substance abuse treatment facilities for alcohol and illicit drugs. They found that both alcohol and
drug treatment admissions declined during economic downturns, but could not rule out the
possibility that “reductions in (substance abuse) treatment supply mechanically lower admissions”

7

illicit drugs examines substance use disorder as based on professionallydeveloped diagnostic criteria 7, an outcome that is more clinically relevant than
simple participation. Our study fills these gaps by using NSDUH data to provide
the first comprehensive evidence on the relationship between economic
conditions and the use of specific illicit drugs, and by providing the first estimates
of the relationship between economic conditions and substance use disorders.

3. Data Description and Empirical Approach
As noted above, our primary data source is the National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH); we use restricted versions from 2002-2013. 8

The

federal government uses these data for determining drug use prevalence in the
United States. The NSDUH is a survey of individuals in non-institutional settings
and was designed to be representative at the state level.
NSDUH respondents are asked a series of questions about their use of
tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drugs, including prescription painkillers.
Specifically, NSDUH respondents are asked: “Now think about the past 12
months, from [DATEFILL] through today. We want to know how many days

(p. 14). Substance abuse treatment use may respond differentially than that of other healthcare
because income effects, which appear to dominate general healthcare utilization decisions during
downturns, may be more than offset by true need for substance abuse treatment (i.e., psychological
stress related to downturns can lead individuals to misuse substances).
7
Davalos et al. (2012) examine alcohol use and/or dependence (using the DSM-4 criteria) with
data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol Related Conditions
(NESARC). They find that higher state unemployment rates are significantly related to increased
likelihood of alcohol abuse and/or dependence.

8

you've used {drug} during the past 12 months.” 9 Based on answers to these
questions, NSDUH statisticians create participation indicators, which are defined
as equal to one if the respondent reported any past year use of the relevant
substance and equal to zero otherwise. The survey also identifies whether the
substance use occurred in the past month, and we create associated indicators for
more recent use accordingly.
We examine several outcomes reflecting different groupings of drugs
based on well-accepted classifications. For alcohol and marijuana, we measure
any past month and past year use of each substance. For illicit drugs, we first
consider a broad participation indicator equal to one if a respondent reported
taking any drug other than alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana in the prior year
(including prescription painkillers), which we call ‘Any Illicit Drug Use’. We
then separate illicit drugs into 7 mutually exclusive categories: cocaine (including
crack);

other

stimulants

(including

methamphetamine);

analgesics

(i.e.,

prescription pain relievers); heroin; sedatives and tranquilizers; hallucinogens;
and inhalants. Table 1 reports mean participation by these 7 categories.
Stimulants are drugs such as cocaine and ‘meth’ that stimulate or
accelerate the central nervous system. Analgesics are drugs used to relieve pain,
and sedatives/tranquilizers are drugs with a sedating effect on the central nervous

8

NSDUH underwent a major redesign between 2001 and 2002; earlier waves are not comparable.

system. 10 Within the category of analgesics we consider oxycontin separately.
Hallucinogens are drugs that produce hallucinations when taken; so-called “club
drugs” such as Special K, LSD, and ecstasy fall into this category.

Within

hallucinogens we separately consider LSD, PCP, and ecstasy. Inhalants comprise
a broad class of substances such as gases, solvents, aerosols, and nitrites that
produce mind-altering effects and share a common route of administration (i.e.,
breathing them in); there are no subcategories for inhalants or heroin.
In addition to recent use, which is the focus of most prior research, a major
strength of the NSDUH is that it also asks respondents a series of questions about
abuse and dependence of various substances (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin,
hallucinogens, inhalants, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives)
over the past year. These include the following problems related to use of the
substance: 1) hazardous use; 2) social/interpersonal problems related to use; 3)
neglected major roles to use; 4) withdrawal (not defined for cannabis, inhalants,
or hallucinogens); 4) tolerance; 5) used larger amounts/longer; 6) repeated
attempts to quit/control use; 7) great deal of time spent using or in associated
activities; 8) physical/psychological problems related to use; and 9) activities
9

Many drugs have multiple ‘street names’; the survey instrument uses these alternate names in
attempting to measure drug use prevalence. Although all of the drug use outcomes are selfreported, these data have been validated by other research (SAMHSA 2012).
10
The wording of the NSDUH questionnaire does not allow us to distinguish the use of opioid
analgesics from the use of non-opioid analgesics such as Fioricet and Fiorinal. However, NSDUH
respondents are asked to identify which prescription drug they have ever used. The use of nonopioid prescription pain relievers appears to be at extremely lows levels: only 0.14 and 0.11
percent of respondents indicate any lifetime use of Fioricet and Fiorinal (respectively) in 2013.

10

given up to use. A recent substantive update to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) no longer differentiates between abuse and
dependence, but instead adopts a substance use disorder rubric that combines
elements of each and places the disorder on a severity continuum (Hasin et al.
2013).

While future NSDUH questionnaires will have DSM-5 criteria for a

revised set of questions as part of a larger redesign of the survey, only DSM-4
criteria are currently available. To reflect the new understanding that substance
use disorder is not separable into abuse and dependence, but should be viewed on
a continuum, we use the DSM-4 diagnostic criteria that overlap with the DSM-5
criteria for questions asked during the period 2002-2013 to calculate a substance
use disorder estimate that attempts to be consistent with the current DSM-5
algorithm 11.
Specifically, we define an individual as having a substance use disorder if
the respondent reported fulfilling two or more criteria of the DSM-4. In addition,
we follow DSM-5 classification scheme by separately examining mild substance
use disorder (2 or 3 criteria), moderate substance use disorder (4 or 5 criteria), and
severe substance use disorder (6 or more criteria). Although slightly different
from the DSM-5 measure, these measures anticipate the DSM-5 changes allowing

11

The DSM-4 and DSM-5 share nearly all substance disorder criteria. Notably, the DSM-5
classification removes a ‘legal problems’ criterion and adds a ‘craving’ criterion. The major
change between the versions is how those criteria are classified into certain diagnoses. Since the
NSDUH does not include questions for the ‘craving’ criterion, we denote our measure as a
‘pseudo’ substance abuse diagnosis measure.

11

us to extend the analysis from simple use patterns to the more consequential
outcomes of substance use dependence. Because the NSDUH does not include
the craving measure in the DSM-5, we will underestimate substance use disorders
based on these criteria.

However, this measurement error should not be

systematically related to economic conditions.
To estimate the effects of economic conditions on the outcomes described
above, we estimate standard two-way fixed effects models that rely on plausibly
exogenous variation in the timing and extent of macroeconomic fluctuations
across states. Specifically, we estimate:
(1) Yist = π0 + π1State Unemployment Ratest + Xistβ + vs + wt + θst + εist,
where Yist are the substance use and disorder outcomes available in the NSDUH
data for individual i in state s at time t. Because some drug participation rates are
very low (i.e., near the 0 boundary), we estimate logistic regression models on the
dichotomous NSDUH outcomes and report marginal effects evaluated at the
sample means.

Xist is a vector of individual characteristics available in the

NSDUH, including: gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, family income, and
marital status. State Unemployment Ratest is the twelve month moving average of
the monthly state unemployment rate prior to the month of the interview date
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; this is a standard approach in the literature

12

(Tekin et al. 2013). 12 In some specifications, we allow for state-specific linear
time trends by interacting a linear trend variable (equal to 1 in 2002, 2 in 2003,
and so forth) with the state fixed effects.

Standard errors are corrected for

clustering at the state level (Bertrand et al. 2004).

4. Results
a. Descriptive Statistics, Substance Use Outcomes and Demographics
We begin by presenting descriptive statistics on drug use in Table 1. Columns 14 present weighted means for past month use, past year use, past year disorder,
and past year disorder conditional on past year use, respectively, for each
substance.
Alcohol and marijuana are by far the most commonly used substances in
the US population. Two thirds of the population reported consuming alcohol in
the past year, and 11 percent reported consuming marijuana. In comparison, 8
percent reported using any illicit drug other than marijuana in the past year, with
nearly 5 percent reporting the use of analgesics.
Turning to substance use disorder, we find that 8 percent of the population
meets the criteria for having a clinically relevant alcohol use disorder, while 1.65
percent of the population had a substance use disorder for an illicit drug. Column

12

In robustness analyses, we explore models that replace the state unemployment rate with the
state employment to population ratio or state per capita GDP, and we also explore models that
measure the unemployment rate at the county level as opposed to the state level.

13

4 reveals that substance use disorders are very common among past-year users of
each substance. For example, while only 0.14 percent of the population reported
having used heroin in the past year, fully 61 percent of past year heroin users meet
the pseudo DSM-5 definition for disorder. Similarly, while only 0.28 percent of
the population reported using sedatives and tranquilizers, nearly 68 percent of past
year users met the definition for disorder. Thus, while the prevalence of past year
use of illicit drugs is rare, clinical disorder is very common among past year
substance users.
Table 2 presents means for the individual demographic characteristics and
state unemployment rate. The majority is white, non-elderly adult (18-64), and
employed, with about half the population having at least some college education
and about half being married. The average state unemployment rate over this
period was approximately 6.7 percent.

b. Results: Economic conditions and substance use
We begin the discussion of our results with the results for substance use, followed
by results for substance use disorder, and concluding with results from several
extensions, robustness checks, and heterogeneous sub-populations.

Table 3

shows our main results on the relationship between economic conditions and
substance use for the major drug categories.

Each entry in Table 3 is the

coefficient on the state unemployment rate variable in a model that includes

14

controls for all the individual demographic characteristics and state and year fixed
effects. In columns (2) and (4) of Table 3, we include state-specific linear trends
as additional controls. In columns (1) and (2), we report results for past-month
outcomes, while in columns (3) and (4) we report results for past-year outcomes.
For alcohol, which has been the subject of most prior work on this topic,
there is some evidence of a procyclical relationship. Specifically, three out of
four estimates of π1 are negative, but only one is significant at conventional
levels: controlling for state-specific trends, a one percentage point increase in the
unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability of past-month
alcohol participation of .0034. Estimates of π1 for marijuana use are small and
statistically insignificant. Similarly, when we consider the use of any illicit drug
in the third row of Table 3, there is no evidence of a relationship with state
unemployment rates using either past-month or past-year outcomes.
The general pattern of null findings is repeated when we turn our attention
to the major drug classes. For example, we find no statistically or economically
meaningful relationships between state economic conditions and use of
analgesics, sedatives and tranquilizers, or inhalants using either past year or past
month measures. We do, however, find a statistically significant procyclical
relationship for stimulants using past-month measures, although the past-year
relationships are not statistically significant.

We also find a statistically

significant countercyclical relationship for hallucinogens using both the past-

15

month and past-year measures (although the past-month relationship is not robust
to including state trends).
In Table 4, we focus on several drug subcategories (e.g., LSD and PCP
instead of the broad category of hallucinogens). The most consistent finding in
Table 4 is that ecstasy use is strongly countercyclical: coefficient estimates on the
state unemployment rate for both past-month and past-year use are positive,
statistically significant, and robust to the inclusion of state trends. Specifically,
controlling for state-specific linear trends, a one- percentage point increase in the
state unemployment rate is associated with a .00049 increase in the probability of
ecstasy use in the past year, or a five percent increase relative to the mean
(.049/.98 = .05). Results in Table 4 also indicate that past-month LSD use is
significantly procyclical, and this relationship holds when examining past-year
use in the model with state trends. There is also some evidence of a procyclical
relationship for PCP, although these results only hold in models with statespecific trends. Overall, the results in Table 4 indicate that ecstasy use is strongly
countercyclical, LSD use is strongly procyclical, and other subcategories of illicit
drugs exhibit a less consistent relationship with state unemployment rates. 13

13

These same general patterns (i.e., mixed evidence on use) remained when we examined
outcomes reflecting ‘regular’ use, such as the probability of reporting at least four uses in the past
month (i.e., approximately once per week) or the probability of reporting at least 12 uses in the
past year (i.e., approximately once per month). These results are available upon request.

16

c. Results: Economic conditions and substance use disorder
In Table 5, we turn to our attention to substance use disorders. Recall that the
disorder questions were only asked regarding outcomes over the past year for the
major drug classes. Results in Table 5 indicate that substance use disorders for
most major drug classes are not related to economic conditions.

Estimated

coefficients of the state unemployment rate for disorders involving marijuana,
cocaine, stimulants, heroin, sedatives and tranquilizers, and inhalants are
consistently small and statistically insignificant. There is some evidence of a
statistically significant countercyclical relationship for alcohol disorders, although
this estimate is not significant in the model with linear state trends.
Table 5 also indicates that disorders involving the use of analgesics and
hallucinogens are significantly countercyclical: controlling for state-specific
linear trends, a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate is
associated with an increase in the probability of having a disorder involving
analgesics of .00049 and increase in the probability of having a disorder involving
hallucinogens of .00017.

For each percentage point increase in the state

unemployment rate, these estimates represent about a six percent increase in the
likelihood of having a disorder involving analgesics and an 11 percent increase in
the likelihood of having a disorder involving hallucinogens.
Next, we investigate robustness of, and extensions to, the key findings on
analgesics and hallucinogens disorders documented in Table 5. These results are

17

reported in Table 6, which shows the results of several extensions and robustness
analyses in the rows. In each row, we report the coefficient of the relevant
economic-conditions variable for analgesics disorder in columns (1) and (2) (with
and without trends, respectively) and for hallucinogens disorder in columns (3)
and (4).
In the first row of Table 6, we report the baseline estimate from Table 5
documenting that

analgesics

and

hallucinogens

disorders

are strongly

countercyclical. Rows (2)-(4) show results separately for mild, moderate, and
severe disorders. 14 These results are somewhat sensitive to the inclusion of statespecific linear trends, although severe disorders involving hallucinogens are
clearly countercyclical with or without controlling for state trends. In row (5), we
again focus on any disorder, but we restrict our attention to individuals whose
NSDUH responses were not imputed to check if SAMHSA imputation procedures
impart any bias to the outcomes. This affects very small share of observations in
the sample with either missing data or logical imputations performed on their
substance use responses; in each case, the estimated coefficient on the state
unemployment rate is nearly identical to the baseline estimate in row (1). In row
(6), we restrict the sample to past-year users of each substance and find that

14

Severity of dependence is determined by the number of dependence criteria the individual
meets, with 2-3 criteria indicating mild dependence, 4-5 indicating moderate dependence, and 6 or
more indicating severe dependence.

18

positive relationship between the unemployment rate and disorders involving
analgesics remains.
In rows (7) and (8) of Table 6, we explore alternative estimation strategies
and show that the findings with regard to analgesics and heroin disorders are
robust to using either a linear probability model or a probit. In rows (9) and (10),
we explore other ways to measure state economic conditions. 15 Although state
unemployment rates are standard in the literature, we also examine state
employment to population ratios in row (9) and state log GDP per capita in row
(10). The results of this exercise suggest that our findings are generally robust to
alternative choices of specification with respect to expected sign and magnitude,
but statistical significance is affected in rows (9) and (10) for analgesics and
hallucinogens, respectively. 16 Finally, in row (11) we show that our results are
similar to outcomes using the DSM-4 classification of abuse and dependence. 17

15

We also examined whether the level of aggregation matters for our estimates by measuring
economic conditions using county (as opposed to state) unemployment rates (Lindo 2015).
Notably, in these models we also replaced the state fixed effects with county fixed effects.
Results indicated that aggregation choices do not alter our core finding that higher unemployment
rates are associated with significant increases in substance use disorders involving analgesics and
hallucinogens. These results are available upon request.
16
We also estimated similarly specified differences-in-differences models relating state
unemployment rates to the likelihood an individual reports she is employed and to the
respondent’s reported household income. State unemployment rates were statistically significant
(negative) predictors of each. These results are available upon request.
17
The NSDUH also asks whether individuals sought treatment for substance use abuse or
dependence in the prior year. In results not reported but available upon request, we did not find
statistically significant relationships between state economic conditions and the likelihood of
seeking treatment for substance use disorders.

19

d. Results: Economic conditions and substance use in heterogeneous subpopulations
In Table 7, we take our core findings on analgesics and hallucinogen
disorders and estimate models separately by demographic characteristics to
examine possible differential treatment effects on sub-populations. The format of
Table 7 follows that of Table 6: in the top row we reprint the main estimates from
Table 5 for analgesics and hallucinogens. The subsequent rows of Table 7 report
results from estimation of equation (1) separately for: men, women, whites,
nonwhites, individuals with a high school degree or less, individuals with some
college or more, individuals under the age of 18, individuals age 18-64, and
individuals in the 15 states with the highest use rates of each drug. 18 The results
show that state unemployment rates are significantly positively related to
analgesics and hallucinogens disorders for men, whites, less educated individuals,
and 18-64 year olds. 19

18

We also examined whether the disorder results varied according to the individual’s reported
occupation. Interpretation of these analyses is complicated by the fact that economic conditions
change who is employed (and thus who is reporting an occupation), but we did find robust
evidence that the countercyclical relationship for substance use disorders involving analgesics is
driven by people in sales/service occupations as opposed to professionals or blue collar workers.
Notably, we also found that among blue collar workers (construction, maintenance, machine
operators, transportation workers, and the armed forces), substance use disorders involving heroin
were also strongly countercyclical. These results are available upon request.
19
We also estimated models for individuals age 65 and older. Estimates of the effect of state
unemployment rates on substance use disorders involving analgesics were not statistically
significant, and there were too few individuals age 65 and older who reported using hallucinogens
to meaningfully estimate similar models for that outcome. We also estimated models separately
for 18-34 year olds and 35-64 year olds but did not find robust differences in the effects across
these age groups for disorders involving analgesics or hallucinogens. We did, however, find that
higher state unemployment rates were significantly related to increases in the likelihood of both

20

In row (10) of Table 7, we restrict our attention to NSDUH respondents
from the 15 states with the highest participation rates for the period 2002-2013.
This restriction is intended to address the concern that use of these drugs may be
highly regional – and thus that many states are mainly contributing noise to the
relationship between economic conditions and the outcomes under study. When
we restrict our attention to the 15 states with the highest rates of hallucinogen use,
we find that disorders involving hallucinogens

are still significantly

countercyclical; when we restrict our attention to the 15 states with the highest
rates of analgesics use, the estimated relationship between the unemployment rate
and disorders involving analgesics is positive with or without state-specific
trends, but only significant in column (1). 20

e. Did the Great Recession change these relationships?
Having demonstrated that disorders relating to analgesics and hallucinogens were
strongly countercyclical over the period 2002-2013, we now ask whether the
Great Recession occasioned a change in the relationship between the
unemployment rate and these disorders. That is, we ask whether the association

heroin use and heroin-related substance use disorders for 18-34 year olds, consistent with the
results for blue collar workers described above. These results are available upon request.
20
For analgesics, the 15 states with the highest rates of use are: West Virginia, Idaho, Michigan,
Alabama, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky,
Washington, Oregon, and Oklahoma. For hallucinogens, the 15 states with the highest rates of use
are: California, Connecticut, Arizona, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Washington, Alaska, New
Mexico, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, and Colorado.

21

between the unemployment rate and these disorders was more (or less)
pronounced during the period December 2007 – June 2009, when the United
States experienced one of the most pronounced recessions in its history.
Specifically, we modify equation (1) by adding a control for whether the
respondent reported on substance use behavior that would have occurred between
December 2007 and June 2009, as well as an interaction between the state
unemployment rate and the Great Recession indicator:
(2)

Yist = π0 + π1State Unemployment Ratest + π2Great Recessiont + π3(State
Unemployment Rate*Great Recession)st + Xβist + vs + wt + θst + εist,

where all variables are as defined above.

If the relationship changed

fundamentally during the recession, we would expect it to be observed on the
interaction term between the unemployment rates and the Great Recession.
We present the results of this exercise in Table 8 for analgesics disorder
(column 1) and hallucinogens disorder (column 2).

For both outcomes, we

confirm the countercyclicality of disorder but fail to find meaningful interactions
between unemployment rates and the Great Recession period. This suggests that
although economic conditions play a strong role in substance use disorder, the
Great Recession period did not fundamentally alter this relationship.

5. Discussion and Conclusion

22

The results above provide the first comprehensive evidence on economic
conditions and illicit drug use in the United States. We overcome inherent data
limitations of prior work by using restricted data from the 2002-2013 National
Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and standard two-way fixed effects
models of illicit drug use and abuse. Prior work has focused nearly exclusively
on alcohol, marijuana, or used a broad categorization of ‘any illicit drug’;
NSDUH data allow us to examine all major drug classes as well as specific
subcategories of illicit drugs.

Results from difference-in-differences models

relating past year use to past year state unemployment rates provide evidence that
recent use of ecstasy is significantly countercyclical, while LSD use is
significantly procyclical. Results for other classes of drugs are mixed and not
consistent.
Our most important results concern clinically meaningful NSDUH
outcomes relating to substance use disorders that are based on (though not
identical to) DSM-5 criteria such as withdrawal, physical/psychological problems
related to use, and hazardous use. To our knowledge, no prior study has linked
economic conditions to substance use disorders for illicit drugs. Individuals with
substance use disorders comprise the disproportionate share of social costs
associated with illicit drug use and represent the main targets of substance use
treatment (Degenhardt and Hall 2012). We find clear evidence that substance use
disorders

involving

analgesics

and

23

hallucinogens

are

both

strongly

countercyclical. These findings, which are highly robust and strongest among
non-elderly adult white men with low levels of education (who were hit hard by
recent economic downturns), are consistent with the observation that deaths from
accidental poisoning have become strongly countercyclical since the 1980s
(Ruhm 2015).
Our results are important for understanding optimal policy responses to
economic booms and busts. Most debates over public funding for drug treatment,
penalties for illicit drug use, and other drug policy levers ignore the role of
economic conditions. Our results highlight the perils of this omission.

For

example, as state budgets contract during economic downturns, drug treatment
funding is particularly vulnerable. Our findings suggest that such funding cuts, if
untargeted, could lead to significant adverse effects on individuals with substance
use disorders.

Notes: Based on data from the 2002-2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Marginal
probabilities (multiplied by 100) from separate weighted logistic regressions of disorders on the
state unemployment rate are reported. Standard errors corrected for clustering at the state level are
in parentheses. Although not shown, controls for individual demographic characteristics and state
and year fixed effects are included. N = 812,300 for all models. Statistical significance is dentoted
by *, **, and *** at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.
