    "abstract": "\n\nA common complaint about tax systems is that they are too complex and several countries offer simplified regimes to subsets of taxpayers. But do such regimes simplify tax reporting or just make it easier to evade taxes? We use panel data on the universe of income tax returns in France and the introduction of simplified tax regimes for the self-employed to assess whether individuals\u2019 shift towards these simpler tax regimes\u2013among others, captured by substantial bunching below the eligibility thresholds\u2013is driven by the desire for simplicity or by motives related to tax evasion. Tax evasion plays a significant role in explaining individuals\u2019 attraction to simpler tax regimes. We develop a structural model to quantitatively assess the importance of simplicity and evasion motives. Our preferred estimates indicate a significant preference for tax simplicity, increasing in the degree of simplicity, ranging from 162 to 942 euros per year per self-employed individual, along with a sizable evasion elasticity.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nA much earlier version of this paper circulated under the title \u201cTax Simplicity and Heterogeneous Learning.\u201d The earlier working paper did not have panel data, which only subsequently became available to researchers, so this new paper provides a different analysis made possible by this data. The original working paper was in collaboration with Ufuk Akcigit, whose invaluable inspiration greatly contributed to shaping it and to whom we are indebted.
