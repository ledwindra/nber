    "abstract": "\n\nIndia\u2019s case fatality rate (CFR) under covid-19 is strikingly low, trending from 3% or more, to a current level of around 2.2%. The world average rate is far higher, at around 4%. Several observers have noted that this difference is at least partly due to India\u2019s younger age distribution. In this paper, we use age-specific fatality rates from 14 comparison countries, coupled with India\u2019s distribution of covid-19 cases to \u201cpredict\" what India\u2019s CFR would be with those age-specific rates. In most cases, those predictions are lower than India\u2019s actual performance, suggesting that India\u2019s CFR is, if anything, too high rather than too low. We supplement the prediction exercises with the application of a decomposition technique, and we additionally account for time lags between case incidence and death, for a more relevant cross-country perspective in the growth phase of the pandemic.\n\n",
