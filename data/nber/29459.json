    "abstract": "\n\nWe document substantial variation in the effects of a highly-effective literacy pro-gram in northern Uganda. The program increases test scores by 1.40 SDs on average, but standard statistical bounds show that the impact standard deviation exceeds 1.0SD. This implies that the variation in effects across our students is wider than the spread of mean effects across all randomized evaluations of developing country education interventions in the literature. This very effective program does indeed leave some students behind. At the same time, we do not learn much from our analyses that attempt to determine which students benefit more or less from the program. We reject rank preservation, and the weaker assumption of stochastic increasingness leaves wide bounds on quantile-specific average treatment effects. Neither conventional nor machine-learning approaches to estimating systematic heterogeneity capture more than a small fraction of the variation in impacts given our available candidate moderators.\n\n",

Deborah Amuka, Victoria Brown,and Katie Pollman of Ichuli Institute were indispensable to the data collection for this study.  This project would not have been possible without the efforts of Anne Alum, Patrick Engola, Craig Esbeck, Jimmy Mwoci, James Odongo, JB Opeto, and the rest of the Mango Tree Uganda staff, who developed and carried out the NULP intervention.  We also thank the students, parents,  and  teachers  from  our  study  schools  in  northern  Uganda.  We  are  grateful  for  funding  from  DFID/ESRC  Raising Learning Outcomes Grant ES/M004996/2, Wellspring, and the International Growth Centre.
