    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the structure of expectations of the weekly money supply announcement in the late 1970s. The data used are from a weekly telephone survey of money market participants. The rationality and structure of expectations are explored with the data organized in three ways:the mean response to each weekly survey, the pooled sample of individual responses, and time series of responses by each individual in the survey.The effect of data aggregation on rationality tests is investigated. The structure of the expectations data are also examined and it is found that both strong regressive influences and adaptive learning characterize the data.\n\n",
