    "abstract": "\n\nThe recent financial crisis has led to a major debate about fair-value accounting.  Many critics have argued that fair-value accounting, often also called mark-to-market accounting, has significantly contributed to the financial crisis or, at least, exacerbated its severity.  In this paper, we assess these arguments and examine the role of fair-value accounting in the financial crisis using descriptive data and empirical evidence.  Based on our analysis, it is unlikely that fair-value accounting added to the severity of the current financial crisis in a major way.  While there may have been downward spirals or asset-fire sales in certain markets, we find little evidence that these effects are the result of fair-value accounting.  We also find little support for claims that fair-value accounting leads to excessive write-downs of banks' assets.  If anything, empirical evidence to date points in the opposite direction, that is, towards overvaluation of bank assets.\n\n",
