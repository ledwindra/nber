    "abstract": "\n\nA simple dynamic game is used for analyzing international environmental problems and climate agreements. Different countries are, over time, emitting as well as investing in green technology. In this framework, we can analyze the business-as-usual outcome, short vs. long term agreements, self-enforcing agreements, participation, compliance, alternative designs, and the development from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement. The text should be accessible to students at any level.\n\n",
