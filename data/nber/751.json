This study examines the relative economic progress of black cohorts and of individual black workers in longitudinal samples to evaluate the permanence of changes. It finds that the preponderance of evidence runs against the proposition that the post-1964 advances have bS2- transitory or illusory. Measured by earnings of workers and occupational attainment, blacks have continued to make significant progress in the 1970s. Measured by the increase in earnings of specific cohorts, black gains did not dissipate due to slow growth of earnings.\n\n",
