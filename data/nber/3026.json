This paper utilizes a unique database to analyze the determinants of the variation in formal training across businesses and the impact of such training on labor productivity. Major findings are that large businesses, those introducing new technology end those who rely on internal promotions to fill vacancies are more likely to have formal training programs. Formal training is found to have a positive effect on labor productivity.\n\n",
