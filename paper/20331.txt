ABSTRACT
Individuals that consume different baskets of goods are differentially affected by relative price changes
caused by international trade. We develop a methodology to measure the unequal gains from trade
across consumers within countries. The approach requires data on aggregate expenditures and parameters
estimated from a non-homothetic gravity equation. We find that trade typically favors the poor, who
concentrate spending in more traded sectors.

Introduction
Understanding the distributional impact of international trade is one of the central tasks pursued

by international economists. A vast body of research has examined this question through the effect
of trade on the distribution of earnings across workers (e.g., Stolper and Samuelson 1941). A second
channel operates through the cost of living. It is well known that the consumption baskets of highand low-income consumers look very different (e.g., Deaton and Muellbauer 1980b). International
trade therefore has a distributional impact whenever it affects the relative price of goods that are
consumed at different intensities by rich and poor consumers. For example, a trade-induced increase
in the price of food has a stronger negative effect on low-income consumers, who typically have
larger food expenditure shares than richer consumers. How important are the distributional effects
of international trade through this expenditure channel ? How do they vary across countries? Do
they typically favor high- or low- income consumers?
In this paper we develop a methodology to answer these questions. The approach is based on
aggregate statistics and model parameters that can be estimated from readily available bilateral
trade and production data. It can therefore be implemented across many countries and over time.
A recent literature in international trade, including Arkolakis et al. (2012), Melitz and Redding
(2014) and Feenstra and Weinstein (2010), measures the aggregate welfare gains from trade by
first estimating model parameters from a gravity equation (typically, the elasticity of imports with
respect to trade costs) and then combining these parameters with aggregate statistics to calculate
the impact of trade on aggregate real income. We estimate model parameters from a non-homothetic
gravity equation (the elasticity of imports with respect to both trade costs and income) to calculate
the impact of trade on the real income of consumers with different expenditures within the economy.
The premise of our analysis is that consumers at different income levels within an economy may
have different expenditure shares in goods from different origins or in different sectors. Studying
the distributional implications of trade in this context requires a non-homothetic demand structure
with good-specific Engel curves, where the elasticity of the expenditure share with respect to
individuals’ total expenditures is allowed to vary across goods. The Almost-Ideal Demand System
(AIDS) is a natural choice. As first pointed out by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980a), it is a firstorder approximation to any demand system; importantly for our purposes, it is flexible enough
to satisfy the key requirement of good-specific income elasticities and has convenient aggregation
properties that allow us to accommodate within-country inequality.
We start with a demand-side result: in the AIDS, the welfare change through the expenditure
channel experienced by consumers at each expenditure level as a result of changes in prices, can
be recovered from demand parameters and aggregate statistics. These aggregate statistics include
the initial levels and changes in aggregate expenditure shares across commodities, and moments
from the distribution of expenditure levels across consumers. The intuition for this result is that,
conditioning on moments of the expenditure distribution, changes in aggregate expenditure shares
across goods can be mapped to changes in the relative prices of high- versus low-income elastic
goods by inverting the aggregate demand. These relative price changes and demand parameters, in
1

turn, suffice to measure the variation in real income of consumers at each expenditure level through
changes in the cost of living.
To study the distributional effects of trade through the expenditure channel we embed this
demand structure into a standard model of international trade, the multi-sector Armington model.
This simple supply side allows us to cleanly highlight the methodological innovation on the demand
side.1 The model allows for cross-country differences in sectoral productivity and bilateral trade
costs, and within each sector goods are differentiated by country of origin. We extend this supplyside structure with two features. First, the endowment of the single factor of production varies
across consumers, generating within-country inequality. Second, consumer preferences are given
by the AIDS, allowing goods from each sector and country of origin to enter with different income
elasticity into the demand of individual consumers. As a result, aggregate trade patterns are driven
both by standard Ricardian forces (differences in productivities and trade costs across countries
and sectors) and by demand forces (cross-country differences in income distribution and differences
in the income elasticity of exports by sector and country).
In the model, differences between the income elasticities of exported and imported goods shape
the gains from trade-cost reductions of poor relative to rich consumers within each country. We
show how to use demand-side parameters and changes in aggregate expenditure shares to measure
welfare changes experienced by consumers at different income levels in response to foreign shocks.
For example, a tilt in the aggregate import basket towards goods consumed mostly by the rich may
reveal a fall in the import prices of these goods, and a relative welfare improvement for high-income
consumers. In countries where exports are high-income elastic relative to imports, the gains from
trade are relatively biased to poorer consumers because opening to trade decreases the relative
price of low-income elastic goods. Non-homotheticity across sectors also shape the unequal gains
from trade across consumers because sectors vary in their tradeability (e.g., food versus services)
and in the substitutability across goods supplied by different exporters.
To quantify the unequal gains from trade, we need estimates of the elasticity of individual
expenditure shares by sector and country of origin with respect to both prices and income. A
salient feature of the model is that it delivers a sectoral non-homothetic gravity equation to estimate
these key parameters from readily-available data on production and trade flows. The estimation
identifies which countries produce high or low income-elastic goods by projecting budget shares
within each sector on standard gravity forces (e.g., distance, border and common language) and a
summary statistic of the importer’s income distribution whose elasticity can vary across exporters.2
Consistent with the existing empirical literature, such as Hallak and Schott (2011) and Feenstra
and Romalis (2014), we find that richer countries export goods with higher income elasticities
within sectors. The estimation also identifies the sectors whose goods are relatively more valued by
1
For example, the model abstracts away from forces that would lead to distributional effects through changes in
the earnings distribution, as well as differentiated exporters within sectors, firm heterogeneity, competitive effects, or
input-output linkages. Future work could consider embedding the AIDS into models with a richer supply side.

When non-homotheticities are shut down, the gravity equation in our model corresponds to the translog gravity
equation estimated by Novy (2012) and Feenstra and Weinstein (2010).

rich consumers by projecting sectoral expenditure shares on a summary statistic of the importer’s
income distribution. Consistent with Hallak (2010), our results also suggest non-homotheticities
not only across origin countries but also across sectors.
Using the estimated parameters, we apply the results from the theory to ask: who are the
winners and losers of trade within countries, how large are the distributional effects, and what
country characteristics are important to shape these effects? To answer these questions we perform
the counterfactual exercise of increasing trade costs so that each country is brought from its current
trade shares to autarky, and compute the gains from trade corresponding to each percentile of the
income distribution in each country (i.e., the real income that would be lost by each percentile
because of a shut down of trade).
We find a pro-poor bias of trade in every country. On average, the real income loss from closing
off trade is 63 percent at the 10th percentile of the income distribution and 28 percent for the
90th percentile. This bias in the gains from trade toward poor consumers hinges on the fact that
these consumers spend relatively more on sectors that are more traded, while high-income individuals consume relatively more services, which are among the least traded sectors. Additionally,
low-income consumers happen to concentrate spending on sectors with a lower elasticity of substitution across source countries. Larger expenditures in more tradeable sectors and a lower rate
of substitution between imports and domestic goods lead to larger gains from trade for the poor
than the rich. While this pro-poor bias of trade is present in every country, there is heterogeneity
in the difference between the gains from trade of poor and rich consumers across countries. In
countries with a lower income elasticity of exports, the gains from trade tend to be less favorable
for poor consumers because opening to trade causes an increase in the relative price of low-income
elastic goods. Similar results appear in counterfactuals involving smaller changes in trade costs
than a movement to autarky; for example, a small reduction in the cost of importing in the food or
manufacturing sectors also exhibits a pro-poor bias. However, trade-cost reductions affecting only
the service sectors (which are relatively high-income elastic) benefits the rich relatively more.
As we mentioned, our approach to measure welfare gains from trade using aggregate statistics
is close to a recent literature that studies the aggregate welfare gains from trade summarized by
Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014). This literature confronts the challenge that price changes
induced by trade costs are not commonly available by inferring them through the model structure
from changes in trade shares.3 These approaches are designed to measure only aggregate gains
rather than distributional consequences.4 In our setting, we exploit properties of a non-homothetic
demand system that also allows us to infer changes in prices from trade shares and to trace out the
welfare consequences of these price changes across different consumers within countries. We are
motivated by the belief that an approach that is able to quantify the (potentially) unequal gains
3
For example, autarky prices are rarely observed in data but under standard assumptions on preferences the
autarky expenditure shares are generally known. The difference between autarky and observed trade shares can then
be used to back out the price changes caused by a counterfactual movement to autarky.

from trade through the expenditure channel for many countries is useful in assessing the implications
of trade, particularly because much of the public opposition towards increased openness stems from
the belief that welfare changes are unevenly distributed.
Of course, we are not the first to allow for differences in income elasticities across goods in
an international trade framework. Theoretical contributions to this literature including Markusen
(1986), Flam and Helpman (1987) and Matsuyama (2000) develop models where richer countries
specialize in high-income elastic goods through supply-side forces, while Fajgelbaum et al. (2011)
study cross-country patterns of specialization that result from home market effects in vertically
differentiated products. Recent papers by Hallak (2006), Fieler (2011), Caron et al. (2014) and
Feenstra and Romalis (2014) find that richer countries export goods with higher income elasticity.5
This role of non-homothetic demand and cross-country differences in the income elasticity of exports
in explaining trade data is an important motivation for our focus on explaining the unequal gains
from trade through the expenditure channel.
These theoretical and empirical studies use a variety of demand structures. To our knowledge,
only a few studies have used the AIDS in the international trade literature: Feenstra and Reinsdorf
(2000) show how prices and aggregate expenditures relate to the Divisia index in the AIDS and
suggest that this demand system could be useful for welfare evaluation in a trade context, Feenstra
(2010) works with a symmetric AIDS expenditure function to study the entry of new goods, and
Chaudhuri et al. (2006) use the AIDS to determine the welfare consequences in India of enforcing
the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights.6 Neary (2004) and Feenstra et al.
(2009) use the AIDS for making aggregate real income comparisons across countries and over time
using data from the International Comparison Project. Aguiar and Bils (2015) estimated an AIDS
in the U.S. to measure inequality in total consumption expenditures from consumption patterns.
A few papers study the effect of trade on inequality through the expenditure channel. Porto
(2006) studies the effect of price changes implied by a tariff reform on the distribution of welfare
using consumer survey data from Argentina, Faber (2013) exploits Mexico’s entry into NAFTA to
study the effect of input tariff reductions on the price changes of final goods of different quality,
and Atkin et al. (2015) studies the effect of foreign retailers on consumer prices in Mexico. While
these papers utilize detailed microdata for specific countries in the context of major reforms, our
approach provides a framework to quantify the unequal gains from trade across consumers over a
large set of countries using aggregate trade and production data. Within our framework we are able
to show theoretically how changes in trade costs map to the welfare changes of individuals in each
point of the expenditure distribution, how to compute these effects using model parameters and
aggregate statistics, and how to estimate the parameters from cross-country trade and production
5

See also Schott (2004), Hallak and Schott (2011) and Khandelwal (2010) who provide evidence that richer
countries export higher-quality goods, which typically have high income elasticity of demand. In this paper we
abstract from quality differentiation within sectors, but note that our methodology could be implemented using
disaggregated trade data where differences in the income elasticity of demand may be driven by differences in quality.

If good-specific income elasticities are neutralized, the AIDS collapses to the homothetic translog demand system
studied in an international trade context by Kee et al. (2008), Feenstra and Weinstein (2010), Arkolakis et al. (2010)
and Novy (2012).

data.
There is of course a large literature that examines trade and inequality through the earnings
channel. A dominant theme in this literature, as summarized by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007),
has been the poor performance of Stolper-Samuelson effects, which predict that trade increases
the relative wages of low-skill workers in countries where these workers are relatively abundant, in
rationalizing patterns from low-income countries.7 We complement these and other studies that
focus on the earnings channel by examining the implications of trade through the expenditure
channel.
The remainder of the paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 uses standard consumer
theory to derive generic expressions for the distribution of welfare changes across consumers, and
applies these results to the AIDS. Section 3 embeds these results in a standard trade framework,
derives the non-homothetic gravity equation, and provides the expressions to determine the gains
from trade across consumers. Section 4 estimates the key elasticities from the gravity equation.
Section 5 presents the results of counterfactuals that simulate foreign-trade cost shocks. Section 6
concludes.

Consumers
We start by deriving generic expressions for the distribution of welfare changes in response to

price changes across consumers that vary in their total expenditures. We only use properties of
demand implied by standard demand theory. In Section 3, we link these results to a standard
model of trade in general equilibrium.

We study an economy with J goods for final consumption with price vector p = {pj }Jj=1 taken
as given by h = 1, .., H consumers. Consumer h has indirect utility vh and total expenditures xh .

The first term on the right-hand side of (3) is an expenditure-share weighted average of price

refer to ω

variation, expressed as share of the initial level of expenditures, associated with a change in prices
or in the expenditure level of individual h.

Almost-Ideal Demand

The Almost-Ideal Demand System (AIDS) introduced by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980a) belongs to the family of Log Price-Independent Generalized Preferences defined by Muellbauer (1975).

The first price aggregator, a (p), has the form of a homothetic translog price index. It is
independent from non-homotheticities and can be interpreted as the cost of a subsistence basket of
goods. The second price aggregator, b (p), captures the relative price of high-income elastic goods.
For our purposes, a key feature of these preferences is that the larger is the consumer’s expenditure
level xh relative to a (p), the larger is the welfare gain from a reduction in the cost of high incomeelastic goods, as captured by a reduction in b (p) . We refer to a and b as the homothetic and
non-homothetic components of preferences, respectively.
Applying Shephard’s Lemma to the indirect utility function defined by equations (7) to (9)
generates an expenditure share in good j for individual h equal to:

for j = 1, . . . , J. We assume that (10) predicts non-negative expenditure shares for all goods and
consumers, so that the non-negativity restriction is not binding. Since expenditure shares add
up to one, this guarantees that expenditure shares are also smaller than one. We discuss how to
incorporate this restriction in the empirical analysis in Section 4.
These expenditure shares have two features that suit our purposes. First, the elasticity with

These parameter restrictions correspond to the adding up, homogeneity, and symmetry constraints implied by
individual rationality, and ensure that the AIDS is a well-defined demand system. No direct-utility representation of
the AIDS exists, but this poses no restriction for our purposes. See Deaton and Muellbauer (1980b).

respect to the expenditure level is allowed to be good-specific.11 Goods for which βj > 0 have positive income elasticity, while goods for which βj < 0 have negative income elasticity.12 Second, they
admit aggregation: market-level behavior can be represented by the behavior of a representative
consumer. The aggregate market share of good j is Sj = sj (p, x
e), where x
e is an inequality-adjusted
mean of the distribution of expenditures across consumers, x
e = xeΣ , where x ≡ E [xh ] is the mean

and Σ ≡ E xh ln xxh is the Theil index of the expenditure distribution.13 We can write the
aggregate shares as

where bb is the change in the log of the non-homothetic component b (p). Note that bb/J equals
the covariance between the good-specific income elasticities and the price changes.14 A positive
(negative) value of b̂ reflects an increase in the relative prices of high- (low-) income elastic goods,
leading to a relative welfare loss for rich (poor) consumers.
11

We note that the AIDS restricts these elasticities to be constant, thus ruling out the possibility that demand peaks
at intermediate levels of income. Several discrete-choice models of trade with vertically differentiated products, such
Flam and Helpman (1987), Matsuyama (2000), or the multi-quality extension in Section VII of Fajgelbaum et al.
(2011), feature non-monotonic income elasticities. Banks et al. (1997) and Lewbel and Pendakur (2009) develop
extensions of the AIDS that allow for non-constant income elasticities.
12
Note that γ’s and β’s are semi-elasticities since they relate expenditure shares to logs of prices and income, but
we refer to them as elasticities to save notation. Note also that although we define xh as the individual expenditure
level, we follow standard terminology and refer to βj as the income elasticity of the expenditure share in good j.

These formulas correspond to infinitesimal welfare changes and can be used to compute a first-order

In deriving this result, we have not specified the supply-side of the economy, and we have
allowed for arbitrary changes in the distribution of individual expenditure levels, {b
xh }. These
demand-side expressions can be embedded in different supply-side structures to study the welfare
changes associated with specific counterfactuals. In the next section, we embed them in a model
of international trade to compute the welfare effects caused by changes in trade costs as function
of observed expenditure shares.

International Trade Framework
We embed the results from the previous section in an Armington trade model. Section 3.1

develops a multi-sector Armington model with Almost-Ideal preferences and within-country income
heterogeneity in Section . Section 3.2 derives the non-homothetic gravity equation implied by the
framework. Section 3.3 presents expressions for the welfare changes across households resulting
from foreign shocks.

The world economy consists of N countries, indexed by n as importer and i as exporter. Each
country specializes in the production of a different variety within each sector s = 1, .., S, so that
there are J = N ×S varieties, each defined by a sector-origin dyad. These varieties are demanded at
different income elasticities. For example, expenditure shares on textiles from India may decrease
with individual income, while shares on U.S. textiles may increase with income. We let psni be the
price in country n of the goods in sector s imported from country i, and pn be the price vector in
s . Perfect competition
country n. The iceberg trade cost of exporting from i to n in sector s is τni
s ps .
implies that psni = τni
ii

Labor is the only factor of production. Country n has constant labor productivity Zns in sector
s. Assuming that every country has positive production in every sector, the wage per effective unit
of labor in country n is wn = psnn Zns for all s = 1, .., S, and an individual h in country i with zh
effective units of labor receives income of xh = zh × wn . Each country is characterized by a mean z̄n
and a Theil index Σn of its distribution of effective units of labor across the workforce. Therefore,
the income distribution has mean x̄n = wn z̄n and Theil index Σi . Income equals expenditure at
the individual level (and we use these terms interchangeably) and also at the aggregate level due
to balanced trade.
16

In assuming that the changes in prices are small, we have not allowed for the possibility that consumers drop
varieties in response to the price changes. When we measure the welfare losses from moving to autarky in the
international trade setup we account for this possibility.

We assume Almost-Ideal Demand and reformulate the aggregate expenditure share equation
s be the value of exports from exporter i to importer n in sector s,

where an = a (pn ) is the homothetic component of the price index (8) in country n and yn =
ln (x̄n/an ) + Σn is the adjusted real income of the economy. The income elasticity βis is allowed
to vary across both sectors and exporters. The richer is the importing country (higher x̄n ) or
the more unequal it is (higher Σn ), the larger is its expenditure share in varieties with positive

The coefficient γiiss0 is the semi-elasticity of the expenditure share in good (i, s) with respect
to the price of good (i0 , s0 ). We assume no cross-substitution between goods in different sectors
0

(γiiss0 = 0 if i 6= i0 ) and, within each sector s, we assume the same elasticity between goods from
different sources (γiiss0 is the same for all i0 6= i for each s, but allowed to vary across s). Formally,

This structure on the elasticities is convenient because it simplifies the algebra, but it is not
necessary to reach analytic results.17 It allows us to cast a demand system that looks similar to a
two-tier demand system (across sectors in the upper tier and across origins within each sector in
the lower tier) and to relate it to homothetic multi-sector gravity models.18

The normalization by N in (21) only serves the purpose of easing the notation in following derivations.
This nesting is a standard approach to the demand structure in multi-sector trade models. For example, see
Feenstra and Romalis (2014) or Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014). Imposing symmetry within sectors also allows
us to compare results to estimates of gravity equations derived under a translog demand system from the literature
(see below).

3.2

Non-Homothetic Gravity Equation

The model yields a sectoral non-homothetic gravity equation that depends on aggregate data
and the demand parameters. These parameters are the elasticity of substitution γ s across exporters
in sector s and the income elasticity of the goods supplied by each exporter in each sector, {βns }.

captures

relative size of the exporter due to, for example, high productivity relative to other countries. The
s , measures both bilateral trade costs and multilateral resistance (i.e., the cost of
third term, Tni

exporting to third countries).
The last term in (27), βis Ωn , is the non-homothetic component of the gravity equation. It
includes the good-specific Engel curves needed to measure the unequal gains from trade across
consumers. This term captures the “mismatch” between the income elasticity of the exporter
and the income distribution of the importer. The larger Ωn is, either because average income or
inequality in the importing country n are high relative to the rest of the world, the higher is the
share of expenditures devoted to goods in sector s from country i when i sells high income-elastic
goods (βis > 0). If non-homotheticities are shut down, this last terms disappears and the gravity
equation in (27) becomes the translog gravity equation.

3.3

Distributional Impact of a Foreign-Trade Shock

Using the results from Section 2, we derive the welfare impacts of a foreign-trade shock across
the expenditure distribution. Without loss of generality we normalize the wage in country n to 1,
wn = 1. Consider a foreign shock to this country consisting of an infinitesimal change in foreign
productivities, foreign endowments or trade costs between any country pair. From the perspective
of an individual consumer h in country n, this shock affects welfare through the price changes

13

{b

to own varieties satisfies:

Expressions (32) to (36) provide a closed-form characterization of the welfare effects of a foreigntrade shock that includes three novel margins. First, preferences are non-homothetic with goodspecific income elasticities. Second, the formulas accommodate within-country inequality through
the Theil index of expenditure distribution Σn , which enters through the level of yn . Third, and
key for our purposes, the expressions characterize the welfare change experienced by individuals at
each income level, so that the entire distribution of welfare changes across consumers h in country

adjusts for the country’s pattern of specialization in high- or low-income elastic goods and for the
change in adjusted real income.
The key term for measuring unequal welfare effects is the change in the non-homothetic component bbn . As we have established, bbn < 0 implies a decrease in the relative price of high income-elastic
goods, which favors high-income consumers. To develop an intuition for how observed trade shares
and parameters map to bbn , consider the single-sector version of the model. Setting S = 1 and
omitting the s superscript from every variable, equation (35) can be written as

bbn = 1 σ 2 dyn − dβ̄n ,

(39)

i=1

The parameter σβ2 is proportional to the variance of the βn ’s and captures the strength of nonhomotheticities across goods from different origins. The term β̄n is proportional to the covariance
between the Sni ’s and the βi ’s, and measures the bias in the composition of aggregate expenditure
shares of country i towards goods from high-β exporters. The larger is β̄n , the relatively more
economy n spends in goods that are preferred by high-income consumers. Suppose that dβ̄n > 0,
i.e., a movement of aggregate trade shares towards high-βi exporters; if γ > 0 and the aggregate
real income of the economy stays constant (dyn = 0), this implies a reduction in the relative price
of imports from high-βi exporters, and a positive welfare impact on consumers who are richer than
the representative consumer.22
Equations (32) to (36) express changes in individual welfare as the equivalent variation of a
consumer that corresponds to an infinitesimal change in prices caused by foreign shocks. To obtain
the exact change in real income experienced by an individual with expenditure level xh in country n
between an initial scenario under trade (tr) and a counterfactual scenario (cf ) we integrate (37),23

Feenstra and Weinstein (2010) measures the aggregate gains from trade in the U.S. under translog preferences in
a context with competitive effects, and Arkolakis et al. (2010) study the aggregate gains from trade with competitive
effects under homothetic translog demand and Pareto distribution of productivity. The AIDS nests the demand
systems in these papers, but we abstract from competitive effects. With a single sector, the translog term in (33)

which depends on just the own trade share. See Arkolakis et al. (2012).
22
At the same time, keeping prices constant, dyn > 0 would imply a movement of aggregate shares to highβi exporters (dβ̄n > 0). Therefore, conditioning on dβ̄n , a larger dyn implies an increase in the relative price of
high-income elastic goods.
23
An expression similar to (40) appears in Feenstra et al. (2009).

In Section 5 we perform the counterfactual experiment of bringing each country to autarky, and
also simulate partial changes in the trade costs. In each case, we compute (40) using the changes in
expenditure shares that take place between the observed and counterfactual scenarios. For that, we
need the income elasticities {βns } and the substitution parameters {γ s }. The next section explains
the estimation of the gravity equation to obtain these parameters.

Estimation of the Gravity Equation
In this section, we estimate the non-homothetic gravity derived in Section 3.24 Section 4.1

describes the data, and Section 4.2 presents the estimation results.

4.1

Data

To estimate the non-homothetic gravity equation we use data compiled by World Input-Output
Database (WIOD). The database records bilateral trade flows and production data by sector for
40 countries (27 European countries and 13 other large countries) across 35 sectors that cover
food, manufacturing and services (we take an average of flows between 2005-2007 to smooth out
annual shocks). The data record total expenditures by sector and country of origin, as well as final
consumption; we use total expenditures as the baseline and report robustness checks that restrict
attention to final consumption. We obtain bilateral distance, common language and border information from CEPII’s Gravity database. Price levels, adjusted for cross-country quality variation,
are obtained from Feenstra and Romalis (2014). Income per capita and population are from the
Penn World Tables, and we obtain gini coefficients from the World Income Inequality Database
(Version 2.0c, 2008) published by the World Institute for Development Research.25
The left-hand-side of (27),

can be directly measured using the data from sector s and

In principle, one could obtain the parameters from other data sources, such as household surveys, that record
consumption variation across households within countries. We have chosen to use cross-country data because it is
internally consistent within our framework, and it is a common approach taken in the literature. In Section 5.4, we
explore results that use parameters estimated from the U.S. consumption expenditure microdata.
25
The World Income Inequality Database provides gini coefficients from both expenditure and income data. Ideally,
we would use ginis from only the expenditure data, but this is not always available for some countries during certain
time periods. We construct a country’s average gini using the available data between 2001-2006.

because we do not directly observe trade costs we cannot separately identify γ s and ρs . Following
Novy (2012) we set ρs = ρ = 0.177 for all s.29
The term Ωn in (41) captures importer n’s inequality-adjusted real income relative to the

more recently Atkin (2013), to proxy the homothetic component an with a Stone index, for which
P
we use an = i Sni ln (pnn dρni ), where pnn are the quality-adjusted prices estimated by Feenstra
and Romalis (2014). The obvious advantage of this approach is that it avoids the estimation of

strongly correlated with countries’ real income per capita; this suggests that Ωi indeed captures

Since bilateral distance is measured between the largest cities in each country using population as weights, it is
defined when i = n; see Mayer and Zignago (2011). Note that we parametrize trade costs such that a positive effect
of common language and common border on trade is reflected in δjs > 0.

Waugh (2010) includes exporter effects in the trade-cost specification. The gravity equation (27) would be

Sns = αs + β yn + εsn .

(44)

This equation is an Engel curve that projects expenditure shares on the adjusted real income.30
Specifically, it regresses sector expenditure shares on sector dummies and the importer’s adjusted real income interacted with sector dummies. The interaction coefficients will have the

structural interpretation as the sectoral betas β .31 Using (28), (43), and (44) we can write

The gravity equation (45) identifies βis − αi β̄ s using the variation in Ωn across importers for
each exporter. Using the β̄ s estimated from the sectoral Engel curve in (44) and the αi estimated
from (45) we can recover the βis (which is needed to perform the counterfactuals). Since the market
P P
shares sum to one for each importer, it is guaranteed that i s βis = 0 in the estimation, as
the theory requires. We cluster the estimation at the importer level to allow for correlation in the
errors across exporters.
The sectoral gravity equation aggregates to the gravity equation of a single-sector model. Summing (45) across sectors s gives the total expenditure share dedicated to goods from i in the

We can readily identify (46) as the

gravity equation that would arise in a single-sector model (S = 1). Thus, summing our estimates on
the gravity terms from (45) will match the gravity coefficients from a single-sector model. Likewise,
P
the sum of the sector-specific income elasticities by exporter s βis estimated from (45) matches
the income elasticity βi estimated from (46).

30

Note that sectoral shares in value added and efficiency units are allowed to vary independently from expenditure
shares depending on the distribution of sectoral productivities Zns and trade patterns. The sectoral productivities are
not estimated and are not needed to perform the counterfactuals.
31
The term εsi captures cross-country differences in tastes across sectors that are not explained by differences in
income or inequality levels. As in Costinot et al. (2012) or Caliendo and Parro (2012), this flexibility is needed for
the model to match sectoral shares by importer. This approach to measuring taste differences is also in the spirit of
Atkin (2013), who attributes regional differences in tastes to variation in demand that is not captured by observables.

18

4.2

Estimation Results

We begin by estimating the single-sector gravity model in equation (46). This regression aggregates across the sectors in the data, and as illustrated in (46), the baseline multi-sector gravity
equation aggregates exactly to this single-sector gravity equation. The results are reported in Table
1. Consistent with the literature, we find that bilateral distance reduces trade flows between countries, which is captured by the statistically significant coefficient on Dni . Under the assumption
that ρ = 0.177, the estimate implies γ = 0.24 (=.043/.177).32 The additional trade costs–common
language and a contiguous border term–also have the intuitive signs.
The table also reports estimates of the 40 βi parameters, one corresponding to each exporter, in
the subsequent rows. The exporters with the highest β’s are the U.S. and Japan, while Indonesia
and India have the lowest β’s. This means that U.S. and Japan export goods that are preferred by
richer consumers, while the latter export goods that are preferred by poorer consumers. To visualize
the β’s, we plot them against the per capita income in Figure 1. The relationship is strongly positive
and statistically significant. We emphasize that this relationship is not imposed by the estimation.
Rather, these coefficients reflect that richer countries are more likely to spend on products from
richer countries, conditional on trade costs. We also note that the β’s are fully flexible, which is
why the coefficients are often not statistically significant, but the null hypothesis that all income
elasticities are zero is rejected.33 Moreover, the finding that a subset are statistically significant is
sufficient to reject homothetic preferences in the data, and is consistent with the existing literature
who finds that richer countries export goods with higher income elasticities.34
We next report the results for the multi-sector estimation. As noted earlier, the analysis involves estimating the Engel curve in (44), which projects sectoral expenditure shares on adjusted
s

real income across countries. Table 2 reports the sectoral betas, β . Compared to food and manufacturing sectors (listed in column 1A), service sectors (listed in column 1B) tend to be high-income
elastic.35 This pattern can be visualized by plotting countries’ expenditure shares in these three
broad categories against their income per capita in Figure 2: the Engel curve for services is positively sloped, while it is negatively sloped for food and manufacturing.36 These sectoral elasticities
32
This estimate is close to the translog gravity equation estimate of γ = 0.167 estimated by Novy (2012). Feenstra
and Weinstein (2010) report a median γ of 0.19 using a different data, level of aggregation and estimation procedure,
so our estimate is in line with the few papers that have run gravity regressions with the translog specification.
33
If we reduce the number of estimated parameters by imposing a relationship between income elasticities and
exporter income, we find a positive and statistically significant relationship between the two variables. Specifically, we
can impose that βi = B0 + P
B1 yi , which is similar to how FeenstraPand Romalis (2014) allow for non-homotheticities.

To see this, we aggregate the β¯s into three categories: food includes “Agriculture” and “Food, Beverages and
Tobacco”, manufacturing includes the remaining sectors listed in column 1A of Table 2, and services is comprised of
the 19 sectors in column 1B. The corresponding elasticities for food, manufacturing and services are -0.0343, -0.0410,
and 0.0753, respectively. (Again, the sum of these three broad classifications is zero.)

elasticities against each other.37
The results of the sectoral gravity equation in (45) is reported in Table 3. Columns 1A and 1B
report the 35 sector-specific distance coefficients, ργ s (where ρ = .177 as before). Recall, these these
coefficients sum to coefficient on distance from the single-sector model (See Table 1). Likewise, the
sector-specific language and border coefficients in columns 2 and 3 of Table 3 sum exactly to the
corresponding coefficients in the single-sector estimation.
We suppress the estimates of {βns } for readability purposes, but recall that

construction, n βns equals the sectoral elasticities β displayed in Table 2. To see how βns relate
to exporter income per capita, we aggregate these coefficients to three broad classifications–food,
manufacturing and services–and report the plot in Figure 3. Analogous to the single-sector estimates in Figure 1, we find that the positive relationship between exporter income per capita and
income elasticities holds within sectors as well.

The Unequal Gains from Trade
This section conducts counterfactual analyses to measure the distributional consequences of

trade. Section 5.1 explains how we numerically implement the expressions from Section 3.3. Section
5.2 shows the results of autarky counterfactuals in the single-sector version of our model. Section 5.3
presents the main results: the autarky counterfactuals in the baseline multi-sector model. Section
5.4 presents a series of robustness checks. In Section 5.5, we conduct counterfactuals of partial
changes in foreign trade costs.

5.1

Computing Consumer-Specific Welfare Changes

To measure the unequal distribution of the gains from trade across consumers, we perform the
counterfactual experiment of changing trade costs. The main results bring consumers in each country to autarky, and we also simulate partial changes in trade costs. Because we know the changes
in expenditure shares that take place between the observed trade shares and the counterfactual
scenarios, we can use the results from Section 3.3 to measure the welfare change experienced by
consumers at each income level. But before applying these results, a few considerations are in
order.
First, we highlight that throughout the analysis we take as given the specialization pattern of
countries across goods with different income elasticity. That is, the βns are not allowed to change
in counterfactual scenarios. These patterns could change as trade costs change, but we note that

37

Caron et al. (2014) estimate sectoral income elasticities on GTAP data using constant relative income preferences.
We match GTAP sector classifications with WIOD sector classifications to produce the scatter plot.

20

the direction of the change will depend on what forces determine specialization across goods with
different income elasticity.38
Second, the restriction to non-negative individual expenditure shares may bind in some intr→cf
stances. Therefore, to compute expression (40) for the welfare change ωn,h
of each consumer

h from country n between the initial scenario under trade (tr) and each counterfactual scenario
(cf ), we must first compute consumer-specific reservation prices. Following Feenstra (2010), this
amounts to setting the individual expenditure shares of dropped varieties to zero according to (23),
and substituting reservation prices back into the consumed varieties. We then numerically integrate
equations (32) to (36) between the aggregate expenditure shares for country n in (22) evaluated
at those reservation prices. As this procedure is done for each consumer h separately, we add a
subscript h to the terms in (40) to denote that the aggregate expenditure shares used to construct
the welfare change of each consumer are consumer-specific:

(47)

We describe these steps formally in Appendix A.
Finally, we assume, as with the gravity estimation, that the expenditure distribution in country
n is lognormal with variance σn2 . This allows mapping the observed gini coefficient to the Theil
index. Henceforth, we index consumers by their percentile in the income distribution, so that
h ∈ (0, 1). Under the log-normal distribution, the expenditure level of a consumer at percentile h
in country i is ezh σi +µi , where zh denotes the value from a standard normal z-table at percentile h,
and x̃i = eσi +µi . We can therefore re-write (47) as:

5.2

Single-Sector Analysis

To convey some intuition, we first report results from the single-sector version of the model
using the parameters from Table 1. Figure 4 plots the gains from trade by percentile of the income

distribution for all the countries in our data (i.e., it plots 1 − ωn,h
for ωn,h
defined in (48) for

all n and h = {0.01, .., 0.99} when each country is moved to autarky). To facilitate the comparisons
across countries, we express the gains from trade of each percentile as difference from the gains
38
If specialization is demand-driven by home-market effects, as in Fajgelbaum et al. (2011), poor countries would
specialize less in low-income elastic goods as trade costs increase. However, if specialization is demand-driven in a
neoclassical environment as in Mitra and Trindade (2005), or determined by relative factor endowments, as in Schott
(2004) or Caron et al. (2014), the opposite would happen. To our knowledge, no study has established the relative
importance of these forces for international specialization patterns in goods with different income elasticity.

of the 50th percentile in each country. The solid red line in the figure shows the average for each
percentile across the 40 countries in our sample.
The typical U-shape relationship between the gains from trade and the position in the income
distribution implies that poor and rich consumers within each country tend to reap larger benefits
from trade compared to middle-income consumers. The reason for these patterns is intuitive in the
light of the earlier discussion of equation (38) for the change in the relative price of high-income
elastic goods. In a movement to autarky, the change in the relative price of high income-elastic
goods experienced by the representative agent of country n is:

The formula reveals that a key determinant of the bias of trade is the income elasticity of each
country’s exports relative to each country’s imports, captured by βn − β̄n .39 A positive βn − β̄n
implies that expenditures move towards higher income elastic goods in a movement to autarky,
potentially implying a reduction in their relative price. Therefore, for low-income (high-income)
countries which tend to be exporters of low (high) income-elastic goods as shown in Figure 1,
trade openness relatively favors rich (poor) individuals.40 In countries that export products with
intermediate income elasticities, middle-income consumers benefit the least from trade because
their home country already supplies these goods; at the same time, opening to trade supplies both
the rich and poor with products that better match their tastes. This creates a U-shaped pattern
of the gains from trade for the typical country in the single-sector model.

5.3

Multi-Sector Analysis

We now present the baseline results from the multi-sector model. We first report the aggregate
gains from trade, defined as the gains for the representative agent in each country. Columns 1A
and 1B of Table 4 report the real income loss for the representative consumer in each country.41
We compare these results to a homothetic case by setting βns = 0 for all n and s in the gravity
estimation and re-estimating the remaining parameters; this amounts to estimating a translog
multi-sector gravity equation. The translog gravity estimates are reported in Appendix Table A.1;
the results reveal that the estimated gravity coefficients hardly change under the constraint that
preferences are homothetic (compare Table 3 with Appendix Table A.1). As a result, the aggregate
gains under the translog specification, reported in Columns 2A and 2B of Table 4, are very similar
to the aggregate gains under the non-homothetic AIDS. This suggests that, in our context, non39

A decomposition of (49) reveals that the second term inside the parenthesis accounts for majority of the variation,
80.7 percent. The first term accounts for only 13.9 percent, and the covariance for the remaining 5.4 percent.
40
When the economy is in autarky, all foreign goods are dropped and demand for the domestic variety corresponds
to a single-good AIDS with unitary income elasticity; see Feenstra (2010). However, the parameter βn still enters in
(49) because it measures the difference in relative prices between the actual trade scenario and the autarky prices.
41
The aggregate gains from trade in the multi-sector setting are higher than the single-sector case. This is consistent
with Ossa (2015) and Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) who show that allowing for sectoral heterogeneity leads
to larger measurement of the aggregate gains from trade in CES environments.

22

homotheticities do not fundamentally change the estimates of the aggregate gains from trade.42
However, as we discuss next, they have a strong impact on the bias of the gains from trade across
consumers.
Figure 5 reports the unequal gains from trade with multiple sectors across percentiles using the
parameters from Tables 2 and 3. As before, the figure shows the gains from trade for each percentile
in each country as a difference from the median percentile of each country. Table 5 reports the
absolute gains from trade at the 10th, median, and 90th percentile, as well as for the representative
consumer of each country (which is identical to Column 1 of Table 4).
There are two important differences between the results under the single- and under the multisector frameworks. First, the relative effects across percentiles are considerably larger. In the
single-sector case from Figure 4, the gains from trade (relative to the median) lie within the -5
percent to 10 percent band across most countries and percentiles, while in the multi-sector case the
range increases to -40 percent to 60 percent. Second, poor consumers are now predicted to gain
more from trade than rich consumers in every country. Every consumer below the median income
gains more from trade than every consumer above the median. On average across the countries in
our sample, the gains from trade are 63 percent at the 10th percentile of the income distribution
and 28 percent at the 90th percentile.
Why do the results for the multi-sector analysis differ from the single-sector analysis? The
multi-sector model allows for two key additional margins that influence the pro-poor bias of trade:

heterogeneity in the elasticity of substitution {γs } and in the sectoral betas β̄ s . By construction,
if we restricted the {γs } and {βns } to be constant across sectors in the multi-sector estimation, we
would recover the same unequal gains from trade as in the single-sector estimation, and Figure 5
would look identical to Figure 4. To gauge the importance of each of these margins in shaping
the unequal gains, Figure 6 shows the average gains from trade by percentile across all countries
for four models: 1) the single-sector model (which is equal to the solid red curve in Figure 4);
2) a multi-sector model with homothetic sectors that imposes β̄ s = 0 for all s but allows for
heterogeneous γ’s; 3) a multi-sector model that imposes symmetric γ’s (γs =

1
J γ)

but allows for

non-homothetic sectors; and 4) the baseline multi-sector model that allows for non-homothetic
sectors and sector-specific γ 0 s (which is equal to the solid red curve in Figure 5).
We find that including non-homotheticities across sectors (i.e., comparing models 1 versus 3
or models 2 versus 4) is crucial for the strongly pro-poor bias of trade. The reason is that lowincome consumers spend relatively more on sectors that are more traded, whereas high-income
consumers spend relatively more on services, which are among the least internationally traded
sectors. Recall from Figure 2 that the income elasticities of the service sectors are higher than
non-service sectors; in addition, the average import share among the service sectors is 6.4 percent
compared to 20 percent and 48 percent for food and manufacturing sectors, respectively. We also
42

We note that this statement relies on defining the aggregate gains as those of the representative consumer.
An alternative,
we do not pursue here, would be to define the aggregate gains as the average change in real
P which

23

find that including heterogeneity in γs across sectors (i.e., comparing models 1 versus 2, or models
3 versus 4) slightly biases the gains from trade towards poor consumers. The reason is that lowincome consumers concentrate spending on sectors with a lower substitution parameter γs . To see
this, we construct, for each percentile in each country, an expenditure-share weighted average of the
sectoral gammas. Then, we average across all countries and report the results in Appendix Figure
A.2. The figure reveals that higher percentiles concentrate spending in sectors where exporters sell
more substitutable goods. In sum, larger expenditures in more tradeable sectors and a lower rate
of substitution between imports and domestic goods lead to larger gains from trade for the poor
than the rich.
While the gains from trade are larger for the poor in every country, we also observe cross-country
heterogeneity in the difference between the gains from trade of poor and rich consumers. What
determines the strength in the pro-poor bias of trade? As in the single-sector case the answer lies
in part in the income elasticity of each country’s products vis-à-vis its natural trade partners. In
countries that export relatively low income-elastic goods, such as India, the gains from trade are
relatively less biased to poor consumers. In these countries, opening to trade increases the relative
price of low-income elastic goods (which are exported), or decreases that of high-income elastic
goods (which are imported). This can be seen in Figure 7, which plots the difference between
the gains from trade of the 90th and 10th percentiles against each country’s income elasticity
P
(βn = s βns ). The difference between the gains from trade of the 90th and 10th percentiles is
more negative in countries with higher income elasticity of exports. However, the income elasticity
of the goods exported by each country is not sufficient to determine the bias of trade, which also
depends on the distribution of expenditures across goods with different income elasticity, as implied
by (35).43

Robustness

This subsection examines the robustness of our baseline results to alternative specifications.

Sectoral Income Elasticities β

The first set of robustness checks examines the robustness of estimating the β using the Engel
curve regression in (44).
An assumption in our framework is that individual preferences are identical across countries.44
This assumption is standard in models of international trade and in quantitative analyses of these
models. A second assumption, that results from the structure of the price elasticities in (21), is that
relative prices do not affect sectoral expenditure shares in (44) other than through the homothetic
component a(p) (and only so if non-homotheticities are present). As a result, equation (44) for
43
If the U.S. and India are excluded from the figure, the relationship remains negative but not significant. This
suggests that although the income elasticity of a country’s products matters, the other terms in (35) also influence
the overall bias of trade.

24

the aggregate shares has an “extended Cobb-Douglas” form consisting of a constant plus a slope
with respect to income. This property of the model is also similar to the majority of multi-sector
trade models that assume Cobb-Douglas preferences across sectors. Our approach to estimating
the Engel curves using cross-country data is consistent with these assumptions. Under these two
assumptions, the slopes of Engel curves across consumers within a country are the same as the
slopes of the Engel curves that we estimate using aggregate data across countries. This motivates
the following two robustness checks.
First, we re-estimate the Engel curve slopes from equation (44) using variation over time by
including country-sector fixed effects, rather than just sector fixed effects. This specification controls
for time invariant differences in country characteristics, and in principle, may result in very different
s

s

estimates of the β parameters.45 However, the β estimated using the specification with countrysector fixed effects are positively correlated with the baseline estimates (the correlation between
the estimates is 0.68). Figure 8 compares the welfare gains, averaged across countries, using these
alternative sectoral elasticities with the baseline results, resulting in very similar patterns.
As a second robustness check, we estimate the sectoral elasticities relying on consumer-level
microdata. This check addresses the concern that variation in consumer expenditures within countries may not be accurately reflected in aggregate expenditures across countries.46 We use the 2013
U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) microdata that records expenditures to estimate the β

where ζns ≡ αs − β ln (an ) and h refers to a household in the CE data. To cleanly map the
categories in the CE with the sectors in the aggregate data, we classify household expenditures
into three broad categories—food, manufacturers and services.48 We find β

to baseline Engel curves, the microdata reveal a positive income elasticity for manufactures, and
a somewhat flatter (though still positive) income elasticity for services. We then re-estimate the
remaining parameters of the model from the gravity equation in (27) imposing these sectoral betas,
and recompute the gains from trade using the same aggregate data as in the baseline case.
The results are presented in Figure 8. Consistent with the baseline results, the poorest consumers gain more from trade than the median. The reason is that in both the CE and aggregate
45

We use an average of bilateral flows between 1995-1997 as the initial year to smooth out annual shocks.
For example, Bee et al. (2012) discusses inconsistencies between aggregation of consumer expenditure surveys
and national accounts data in the U.S.
47
If the CE recorded expenditures by country of origin and/or prices, it would be possible to use these data to
estimate obtain estimates of βns and/or γ s .
48
We use the 2013 quarterly-level summary expenditure files: fmli132.dta, fmli133.dta, fmli134.dta, and
fmli141.dta. We analyze consumption in the current quarter, and construct the categories as follows. Food is
the sum of {foodcq alcbevcq, tobacccq}. Manufactured goods is the sum of {apparcq, cartkncq, cartkucq, othvehcq,
gasmocq, tvrdiocq, otheqcq, predrqcq, medsupcq, houseqcq, misccq}. Services is the sum of {vehfincq, mainrpcq,
vehinscq, vrntlocq, pubtracq, feeadmcq, hlthincq, medsrvcq, sheltcq, utilcq, housopcq, perscacq, readcq, educacq,

data, the Engel curve on food sectors is negative and has low γ s . The main difference is revealed
at the top of the expenditure distribution. In the baseline results, we generally find that the rich
gain less than the median-income consumer. But when we estimate the sectoral income elasticities
using the the CE data, the average curve bends upward at higher income levels. This is because
manufacturing sectors have a higher income elasticity in the CE data and are also more tradeable
(relative to services). As a result, using sectoral income elasticities from microdata reveals a slightly
different bias of trade relative to the baseline case.
5.4.2

Price Elasticity of Service Sectors and Non-Tradeability

The second set of robustness checks alter the assumptions on the degree of tradeability of
some of the service sectors in the data. As discussed earlier, the high elasticity parameters γ s in
service sectors partly affect the bias of the unequal gains. These parameters were obtained by first
identifying ρs γ s from the semi-elasticity of trade with respect to distance in the gravity equation
45, and then setting ρs = 0.177 for all sectors. However, one might expect ρs to be higher for some
service sectors that are essentially non-traded, which would lead us to over-estimate the value of
γ s these sectors.49
We perform two robustness checks to address this concern. In a first robustness check, we
increase the value of ρ by 25 percent to 0.221 for the 12 service sectors that have, on average across
countries, expenditures on imports of less than 10 percent.50 By increasing ρ for these sectors, we
lower their corresponding γ’s by 20 percent. In a second robustness check, we treat these 12 service
categories as non-tradeable. Appendix B shows that the equations (32) to (36) for the welfare
effects of a foreign-trade shock carry over exactly in the presence of non-traded sectors, the only
difference being that these sectors must be excluded from the computations.
We re-compute the gains from trade in each of these two cases, and compare the results, averaged
across countries, to the baseline result in Figure 9. The three curves are very similar; this reassures
us that the main results are not sensitive to the value of ρ in sectors that plausibly have higher
price elasticities. The high similarity across these cases is not surprising since the sectors affected
by each robustness check features little trade, so that their inclusion in the baseline model does not
considerably affect the computations.
5.4.3

Additional Checks

Finally, we present additional robustness checks. As noted earlier, the parameter ρ cannot be
separately identified in the data. We therefore re-run the counterfactuals assuming a ρ = 0.221,
or a 25 percent increase from the baseline value. This implies reducing of the estimate of γ, and
as a result, increases the gains from trade according to equation (32). While the welfare estimates
49
Anderson et al. (2012) show that geographic barriers are a stronger deterrent of trade of some services trade
than of goods trade.
50
These sectors are: electricity, gas and water; construction; motor vehicle sales and maintenance; wholesale trade;
retail trade; hotels and restaurants; telecommunications; real estate; public administration and defense; education;
health; and other personal services.

26

in levels increase, Figure 10 shows that the relative gains from trade across percentiles are largely
unaffected. The figure also reports the results from setting ρ = 0.133, a 25 percent decrease in the
baseline value, and again the results are qualitatively unchanged. Hence, while ρ affects the level
of the gains from trade predicted by the model, it does not affect the distributional bias.51
Next, we examine the sensitivity of our analysis by using final rather than total expenditures.52 As mentioned earlier, the WIOD allow us to separate final expenditures from total expenditures, and we use these data to re-estimate the main results. See Appendix Tables A.2 and
A.3 for the parameter estimation results. Figure 11 reports the welfare gains, averaged across
countries, against the baseline results, and the results are similar.
The last robustness checks implements a more flexible version of the gravity equation in (45)
by replacing Yns/YW with exporter-sector pair fixed effects. This specification is more flexible in that
it does not rely on the full structure of the model. We report the results of the sectoral gravity
s

equation in Appendix Table A.4 (the Engel-curve estimates of the β are the same as those reported
in Table 2), and find a correlation of the income elasticities with the baseline coefficients of 0.90.
Figure 11 compares the welfare gains with the baseline results, and once again the message remains
unchanged.

5.5

Partial Changes in Trade Costs

The welfare changes implied by the trade-to-autarky counterfactual are special in two ways.
First, the magnitude of the shock is larger than what is typically experienced by countries that
enact trade reforms. Second, trade reforms often target specific sectors rather than all sectors at the
same time; as such, the clear pro-poor bias of trade may not be present when a trade liberalization
only affects specific sectors. In this sub-section, we examine the welfare implications of partial
reductions in trade costs involving specific sectors.
s = −5
We consider a 5 percent reduction in the cost of importing in specific sectors: ∆ ln τni
s = 0 otherwise. We
percent for all i 6= n and for all s in some subset of all sectors, and ∆ ln τni

separately simulate the welfare impact of this shock for each country n at a time treating each
country as a small open economy, so that changes in trade costs have a negligible impact on
wages in foreign countries. The change in the price of goods in sector s imported from i relative
s for all i, s. Feeding these price
to domestically produced goods is then ∆ ln (psni /psnn ) = ∆ ln τni

changes to the aggregate demand system (20) we find the aggregate shares in the final scenario,
and then follow the steps in Section 5.1 to measure welfare changes by percentile.
We first compare the welfare change of the representative consumer implied by this shock for
manufacturing sectors with the welfare changes implied by a standard multi-sector Armington trade
51

When ρ = 0.133, the aggregate gain from trade, averaged across countries, is 25 percent. When ρ = 0.221, the
average is 37 percent.
52
We work with total expenditures as the baseline because separating final expenditures requires taking a stand on
the end use on products (see Dietzenbacher et al. 2013). The most accurate way to account for intermediate inputs
would be to enrich the supply-side structure to account for input-output linkages, but we do not pursue this route
here.

27

model with Cobb-Douglas preferences across sectors and CES preferences across origins within
sectors (e.g, Ossa 2015).53 Appendix Table A.5 shows that the aggregate gains estimates are very
similar between the two models (correlation of 0.98). The 5 percent reduction in the cost of all
manufacturing imports increases welfare of the representative consumer by between 0.2 percent and
1.3 percent across countries.
Figure 12 displays three panels that report the average welfare change across countries corresponding to the 5 percent trade cost decrease in the food sectors, the manufacturing sectors, and
the service sectors. Given the smaller shock to prices, the differences in the gains from trade across
percentiles are, of course, smaller than in the case of moving to autarky. A pro-poor bias of trade
still results when sectors within food or manufacturing, which are typically negative-income elastic,
experience a decline in foreign trade costs. Alternatively, when only the service sectors, which are
typically positive-income elastic, experience a decline in the cost of importing, we see an overall
U-shaped pattern, with the very rich gaining relatively more.

Conclusion
This paper develops a methodology to measure the distribution of welfare changes across hetero-

geneous consumers through the expenditure channel for many countries over time. The approach
has broad applicability as it is based on aggregate statistics and model parameters that can be
estimated from readily available bilateral trade and production data. This is possible by using
the AIDS demand structure which allows for non-homotheticities and has convenient aggregation
properties.
We estimate a non-homothetic gravity equation generated by the model to obtain the key
parameters required by the approach, and identify the effect of trade on the distribution of welfare
changes through counterfactual changes in trade costs. The estimated parameters suggest large
differences in how trade affects individuals along the income distribution in different countries.
The multi-sector analysis reveals that the gains from trade are typically biased towards the poor.
This is because the poor tend to concentrate expenditures in sectors that are more traded, and
because these sectors have lower price elasticities. Heterogeneity in the pro-poor bias of trade is
driven, in part, by a country’s pattern of specialization relative to its trading partners.
While our goal in this paper is to demonstrate the importance of demand heterogeneity across
consumers for the distributional effects of trade, we believe that a promising avenue lies in integrating this approach with a richer supply-side structure to measure jointly the impact of trade through
both the expenditure and income channels across consumers. We leave this for future work.

Appendix to Section 5
This appendix provides the details to implement the counterfactuals in Section 5.

A.1

Reservation Prices

The restriction to non-negative individual expenditure shares may bind in the counterfactuals. In these cases,
we find consumer-specific reservation prices that set the individual shares of dropped varieties to zero, and adjust
s,j
the remaining individual shares using these reservation prices. Let Nn,h
be the number of varieties not consumed by
n
o
 s,j
s,j
percentile h from country n in sector s at prices pni under scenario j, In,h
be the set of such varieties, and ps,j
ni,h
be the reservation prices of consumer h. The notation j may correspond to the initial scenario under trade (j = tr)
or to a counterfactual (j = cf ).

For each percentile h in country n, we have that ps,j

ni,h
ni,h < 0 we include n in the set In,h of the next iteration; since yn,h is not observed,
s,tr
i∈I
/ n,h

we approximate its value using yntr . It can be shown that this procedure is formally equivalent to evenly redistributing
the shares of varieties predicted to be negative at the actual prices among the remaining varieties within each sector.55
Autarky For the counterfactuals that move consumers to autarky in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, only own-country varieties
s,cf
are consumed; this implies In,h
= {i : i 6= n}. Equations (23) and (25) then imply:

integrate dyn using (36) between Sni
and Sni,h
starting from the initial condition yntr . These steps yield an

that is then used as a guess for the next iteration, and the procedure continues until convergence.
cf
This procedure achieves convergence to the same yn,h
from multiple initial guesses for each percentile-country pair
for all but a handful of cases which are excluded from the figures and tables referenced in Section 5.56

Partial Changes in Trade Costs For the counterfactuals involving partial changes in foreign-trade costs (Section
5.5) we construct individual shares following steps similar to the initial trade scenario using the aggregate final shares

Computing Welfare Changes with a Non-Traded Sector

We derive the welfare results assuming that a subset of sectors are non-traded. Assume that s = N T is a nontraded sector. We show that equations (32) to (36) for the welfare effects of a foreign-trade shock remain the same
with the only difference being that the non-traded sector is excluded from the expressions.
In sector s = N T , the preferences of country n are only defined over the variety produced by country n. We
let β N T be the income elasticity corresponding to the non-traded sector. The adding-up constrain then implies

Notes: Table reports the sectoral income elasticities from the Engel curve equation. It is a regression of importers' sectoral expenditures
shares on the adjusted real income interacted with sector dummies. Sectors "Agriculture" and "Food, Beverages and Tobacco" are the
food sectors, and the remaining sectors in column 1A are the manufacturing sectors; the service sectors are listed in column 1B. The
regression	  also	  includes	  sector	  fixed	  effects.	  Standard	  errors	  are	  clustered	  by	  importer.	  Significance	  *	  .10;	  **	  .05;	  ***	  .01.

Notes: Table reports the estimates of the sectoral gravity equation. The results report sector-­‐specific coefficients on (the negative of) distance, language and border in columns 1, 2 and
3, respectively. The sum of these coefficients exactly sum to the corresponding coefficients in Table 1. The table supresses the sector-­‐exporter interaction coefficients to save space, but
recall that the sum of these coefficients across sectors equals sectoral coefficients in Table 2, and the sum of the coefficients for each exporter across sectors equals the country-­‐specific
coefficients	  in	  Table	  1.	  Standard	  errors	  are	  clustered	  by	  importer.	  Significance	  *	  .10;	  **	  .05;	  ***	  .01.

Notes: Table reports gains from trade. The first and third columns repors the gains for the representative agent and median consumer, respectively, using the estimated
parameters from Tables 2 and 3. The second column computes welfare changes using a translog demand system; these parameters are obtained from re-­‐running the
gravity	  equation	  imposing	  βsi=0	  (see	  Appendix	  Table	  A.1).	  The	  fourth	  column	  reports	  the	  aggregate	  import	  share	  for	  each	  country.

Notes: Table reports the estimates of the sectoral gravity equation using data on final expenditures. The results report sector-­‐specific coefficients on (the negative of) distance, language
and border in columns 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The table supresses the sector-­‐exporter interaction coefficients to save space, but recall that the sum of these coefficients across sectors
equals	  sectoral	  coefficients	  in	  Table	  A.2.	  Standard	  errors	  are	  clustered	  by	  importer.	  Significance	  *	  .10;	  **	  .05;	  ***	  .01.

Notes: Table reports the estimates of the sectoral gravity equation that includes sector-­‐exporter pair fixed effects. The results report sector-­‐specific coefficients on (the negative of)
distance, language and border in columns 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The table supresses the sector-­‐exporter linteraction and level coefficients to save space, but recall that the sum of the
interaction coefficients across sectors equals sectoral coefficients in Table 2, and the sum of the coefficients for each exporter across sectors equals the country-­‐specific coefficients in

Notes: Table reports welfare changes in the multi-­‐sector model from a 5% decline in
foreign trade costs in the manufacturing sectors. Column 1 reports the results using the
AIDS demand system, and column 2 reports results from the CES demand system (e.g.,
Ossa 2015). The elasticities for the CES system are taken from Ossa (2015) and matched
the	  WIOD	  industry	  classification.	  The	  correlation	  between	  the	  two	  models	  is	  0.99.
