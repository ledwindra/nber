A Transactions Based Model of the Monetary

Transmission Mechanism: Part 2

ABSTRACT

In Part 1 the dynamics of an open market operation were analyzed for

the case of logarithmic utility. Though such a utility function is useful
for illustrative purposes, the implication that current prices are independent

of current and future monetary injections is unsatisfactory. This implication
results from the fact that with logarithmic utility future consumption is

independent of the rate of return to savings. In Part 2 the logarithmic
utility assumption is replaced by the more general assumption that utility is
of the constant elasticity form such that future consumption is an increasing

function of the interest rate. Though a closed form solution cannot be derived
for this case, it is shown that the basic results of Part 1 still hold: An
increase in money causes a sluggish response of the price level and a fall
in interest rates.

In Part 1 the dynamics of an open market operation were analyzed for

the case of logarithmic utility. Though such a utility function Is useful
for illustrative purposes, the implication that current prices are independent

of current and future monetary injections is unsatisfactory. This implication
results from the fact that with logarithmic utility future consumption is
independent of the rate of return to savings. In Part 2 the logarithmic
utility assumption is replaced by the more general assumption that utility

is of the constant elasticity form such that future consumption is an increasing

this case, it is shown that the basic results of Part 1 still hold: An
increase in money causes a sluggish response of the price level and a fall
in interest rates.

As in Part 1 we will be concerned with equilibrium near the steady
state, where the initial cash in advance constraint will be binding. In order
to analyze an open market operation which occurs only during period 1,
set

(1)

M =

M(l

+ k), for t >

1,

where k is the % increase in money which occurs at time 1, and N = Ma
is the steady state stock of money. Also set

y. Thus (2.20), gives

the following second order difference equation

(2)

Recall that for t > 3, py is the amount of money flowing Into and hence

t—l is the money holdings at

out of the bank at t—l. Thus

(Pt \
plans to exhaust his money at the end of t+l by spending
during t+i. The term

is the money held at the end of t by the people

making a withdrawal at t. Hence the left hand side of (2) is total money
holdings at the end of t.
Note that (2) implies that

Since prices are non—negative, (5) is defined only for non—negative
Equation (5) gives the path of the one period returns to holding money
It is somewhat easier to work with rates of return than prices so we will

study (5) rather than (2). Note that (5) has only one steady state namely

Hence It must go to positive infinity or zero.

However this will violate (5) for 1 sufficiently large or close to zero, QED

Lemma 1 implies that if there are ever 2 consecutive

1' both above

Pt goes to infinity or Pt goes to zero, and (5)

will eventually fail. Each of these possibilities Is inconsistent with

market clearing. To see this look at equation (2), Since k and M are

given with (l+k)M > 0 and 0 < q < 1, It cannot be the case that prices
get Indefinitely high or go to zero:

(2) will eventually fail.

Intuitively, If prices get too high then people will be demanding more
money than the whole stock of money to make their purchases.

Similarly if

Pt gets too small the purchasing power of M(l+k) will exceed the stock

of goods. Hence

Corollary 1

If Pt is an equilibrium price path i.e., (2) and (3) hold,

then there is no t > 3 such that (a)

< 1 and

< 1, or (b)

> 1

and 't+l > 1.

Recall from Part 1, that except for the case of logarithmic utility

we have no equation to determine p1. That is, (3a) gives p2 as a function

of p1. This and (3b) gives

p3 as a function of p1. Thus p3 and p2

are determined as a function of p1. Equation (2) is a second order
difference equation which requires a

p3 and p2 to start it off. Thus for

every p1, in general there will be a path generated by (2) and (3) which
is a candidate path for an equilibrium. The paradox of this seemingly
continuum of equilibria can be resolved by showing that the second order

< 1 unless p2

difference equation in (2) will eventually violate 0 <

and p3 satisfy a particular functional relationship. In particular given
a p2 we will show that there exists at most one

in that neighborhood there exists

a 13 such that the solution to (5) converges to the steady state. We will
need the following theorem.

is the 2 x 2 matrix of derivatives

of g with respect to x. Assume that the two characteristic roots of

A satisfy 1X11 > 1 and IX2 < 1. Then there exists a one dimensional
manifold M in LI2, tangent to the stable manifold of the linear system at
x, with the following properties: there exists an open neighborhood of x

say N such that if x E N fl N and Cx } is generated from x41 =

starting at x, then

Theorem 1 is analogous to the stable manifold theorems for differential
equations, see Coddington and Levinson Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 on pp.330—334.
Of course, not all theorems for differential equations are true for difference

equations. However Theorem 1 is true. In particular Scheinkman (1974)
(i.e., his Lemma 6 of Part II) proves most of Theorem 1 following steps

analogous to Coddington and Levinson. The remainder of the theorem is
straightforward following Scheinkman's discrete time rendition of Coddington and

and Levinson. Thus a proof will not be given here.
We will use Theorem 1 to prove a global property of the difference
equation (5).

II. The Non Neutrality of pen Market Operations
It is easy to use Lemma 1 to show that prices respond slowly to an

open market operation. The next Theorem shows that a k% increase in money
via an open market operation leads the initial price to move by less than

k%. (Similarly prices initially fall by less than k% if there is a monetary
contraction .)

Throughout this Section M: and M' are as given in (3.2).

Proof,

We give the proof for k < 0, The proof for k > 0 is similar. So
suppose k < 0 and p1 < (l+k)p, then this leads to a contradiction as

follows. Let Pt be the equilibrium path generated for k < 0. From (3a)

to (2) evaluated at t = 3

and conclude that q(y3) > 4(l), SO 13 >

Corollary 1 this is impossible.

QED

It can also be shown that prices respond gradually to a small monetary

injection, with p1 rising, p11p2, p2/p3 falling and p3/p4 rising relative
to their steady state positions of p,l,l, and 1 respectively. This is easily
seen by differentiating (8) with respect to k, evaluating the derivatives

at k = 0, and using the fact that m'(l) =

is

the slope of the linearized

system in Theorem 2.

Finally, it is possible to show that a small increase in money by an
open market operation lowers both the initial two period nominal rate and

real rate. This can be proved by noting that from (2.23)

p1 as a function of k, and hence

as a function of k. Thus R1R2 is determined

as a function of k. This function can be differentiated and evaluated at
k

0 to verify that an increase in k lowers R1R2 for k small.

Si.milarly the real race is easily shown to fall because there is inflation

with respect to k at k = 0.

III. Conclusions
The determination of the initial price level for the model of Part 1

with non—logarithmic utility has been presented. This facilitated a simple
proof that open market increases in money lead to a sluggish price level

response and a temporary fall in interest rates. These results assume that
the open market operation is sufficiently small so that people do not return

to the bank (initially) with unspent cash. Throughout Part 1 and Part 2, the
period between trips to the bank has been taken to be independent of the size

of the open market operation. It would be useful but difficult, to extend our
results to a model where the transaction period is endogenous. It would be
far more useful to discuss the possibility of returns to the bank with unspent
cash balances in such a model, rather than in the current model.

This

shows that there is a unique equilibrium for economies beginning
(i.e., for small monetary shocks), given that the initial
cash in advance constraints are binding. Clearly, if we do not assume

near k = 0

they are binding there will be no p1 in a neighborhood of the p which
solves (8) in which the constraint will fail to bind, and which leds to
a convergent equilibrium. This is because, by the stable manifold property
small changes in the initial conditions will lead to small changes in all
y and consumptions. Thus since (2.26) holds as a strict inequality for
te solution to (8) it will also be a strict inequality for the alternative
path. Hence the cash in advance constraint will bind for all prices which
begin in a neighborhood of the steady state.
