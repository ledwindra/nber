    "abstract": "\n\nGlobalization is expected to be reversed, at least partially, in the post pandemic era. The Great Financial Recession of 2008\u201310 marked a historic turning point in the direction of weakening the degree of global economic integration. Now, in the post-pandemic era, policymakers appear poised to take deliberate steps to reinforce the movement toward de-globalization. At the same time, safety nets are expected to be strengthened. In this paper, we develop a model, with which we analyze central macroeconomic interactions between globalization and safety nets. We  put together stylized elements of  trade globalization,  financial globalization, international tax competition, immigration, and welfare state, all in a  two-skill, two-period stylized model, where  policy (taxes and social benefits) is determined through majority voting.\n\n",
