    "abstract": "\n\nNatives benefit from immigration mainly because of production complementarities between immigrant workers and other factors of production, and these benefits are larger when immigrants are sufficiently `different' from the stock of native productive inputs. The available evidence suggests that the economic benefits from immigration for the United States are small, on the order of $6 billion and almost certainly less than $20 billion annually.  These gains, however, could be increased considerably if the United States pursued an immigration policy which attracted a more skilled immigrant flow.\n\n",
