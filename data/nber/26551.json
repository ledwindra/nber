    "abstract": "\n\nOpioid addiction and mortality skyrocketed over the past decade.  A casual look at the geographic incidence of opioid mortality shows sharply higher mortality rates in the Appalachian region, especially in coal-mining areas.  This has led observers to make a link that was characterized by one newspaper as \u201cabandoned by coal, swallowed by opioids.\u201d  We test that theory using restricted death data and mine level coal production data.   Specifically, we examine whether higher reliance on coal mining in a county\u2019s economy leads to higher or lower opioid mortality.  We find a positive relationship between the share of coal miners among total local labor force and county-level opioid mortality rates.  This contradicts the \u201cabandoned by coal, swallowed by opioids\u201d story.  Rather our results suggest that the higher rates of injury in underground coal mining (in particular) lead to greater amounts of opioid consumption and mortality.  An implication is that the decline in coal mining in the United States may have a positive spillover in the form of reduced mortality from opioid use.\n\n",
