Making the House a Home: The Stimulative Effect of Home Purchases on Consumption and
Investment

NBER Working Paper No. 23570

ABSTRACT
We introduce and quantify a new channel through which the housing market affects household
spending: the home purchase channel. Using an event-study design with data from the Consumer
Expenditure Survey, we show that households spend on average $3,700 more in the months
before and the first year following a home purchase. This spending is concentrated in the homerelated durables and home improvements sectors, which are complementary to the purchase of
the house. Expenditures on nondurables and durables unrelated to the home remain unchanged or
decrease modestly. We estimate that the home purchase channel played a substantial role in the
Great Recession, accounting for one-third of the decline in home-related durables spending and a
fifth of the decline in home maintenance and investment spending from 2005 to 2010, together
totaling $14.3 billion annually.

I. INTRODUCTION
Why	   do	   household	   consumption	   and	   the	   housing	   market	   move	   in	   tandem	   through	  
periods	  of	  both	  prosperity	  and	  decline?	  This	  question	  has	  been	  central	  to	  macroeconomic	  
analysis	   and	   monetary	   policy-­‐making	   in	   the	   United	   States	   since	   2000,	   as	   the	   aggregate	  
economy	   experienced	   a	   dramatic	   expansion	   and	   contraction	   that	   mirrored	   the	   boom	   and	  
bust	   in	   the	   housing	   market.	   Previous	   studies	   of	   this	   pattern	   have	   focused	   on	   the	   role	   of	  
housing	   wealth	   in	   spurring	   household	   consumption	   through	   its	   effects	   on	   overall	   wealth,	  
credit	  constraints,	  and	  employment.	  
In	   this	   paper	   we	   propose	   and	   provide	   evidence	   for	   a	   further	   link	   between	   the	  
housing	  market	  and	  household	  consumption	  that	  does	  not	  operate	  directly	  through	  house	  
prices.	  We	  argue	  that	  home	  purchases,	  which	  experienced	  a	  boom	  and	  bust	  similar	  to	  that	  
of	   home	   prices	   since	   2000,	   stimulate	   durable	   consumption	   by	   raising	   demand	   for	   goods	  
and	   services	   complementary	   to	   the	   home.	   This	   relationship	   follows	   from	   two	   main	  
assumptions.	   First,	   owing	   to	   search	   frictions,	   households	   cannot	   find	   homes	   that	   match	  
their	   specific	   tastes	   and	   stock	   of	   durable	   goods.	   Buyers	   therefore	   tailor	   their	   newly	  
purchased	  home	  to	  their	  preferences	  by	  altering	  the	  physical	  structure	  and	  by	  buying	  new	  
furnishings	   and	   appliances.	   Second,	   these	   alterations	   and	   purchases	   are	   at	   least	   in	   part	  
irreversible.	   Home	   renovations	   and	   additions,	   for	   example,	   cannot	   be	   moved	   from	   one	  
residence	   to	   the	   next.	   Many	   fixtures,	   appliances,	   and	   furnishings	   are	   also	   purchased	   to	  
complement	   a	   particular	   physical	   space	   and	   so	   are	   purchased	   anew	   after	   a	   move.	   Given	  
these	   assumptions,	   aggregate	   consumption	   will	   expand	   and	   contract	   with	   the	   number	   of	  
transactions	   during	   housing	   cycles.	   This	   home	   purchase	   channel	   is	   particularly	   potent	   in	  
housing	   downturns,	   when	   sales	   tend	   to	   move	   more	   strongly	   with	   –	   and	   react	  
proportionately	  more	  than	  –	  home	  prices.

Our	   analysis	   uses	   microdata	   on	   household	   spending	   and	   building	   permits	   to	  
estimate	  the	  relationship	  between	  home	  purchases	  and	  home-­‐related	  spending.	  Our	  main	  
tests	  rely	  on	  monthly	  expenditures	  reported	  by	  homeowners	  in	  the	  Consumer	  Expenditure	  
Survey	  (CE)	  between	  2001	  and	  2013.	  We	  also	  examine	  home	  improvement	  activity	  using	  
property-­‐level	   data	   on	   building	   permits	   compiled	   by	   BuildFax	   from	   city	   and	   county	  
permitting	   agencies.	   These	   data	   provide	   quarterly	   measures	   of	   permitting	   activity	   –	   the	  
number	   of	   permits	   and	   the	   estimated	   project	   job	   cost	   –	   for	   a	   sample	   of	   approximately	   nine	  
million	  homes	  that	  sold	  between	  2001	  and	  2013.	  
A	   great	   deal	   of	   household	   spending	   is	   tied	   to	   the	   home.	   Homeowners	   surveyed	   in	  
the	  CE	  spend	  an	  average	  of	  $1,700	  per	  year	  on	  home	  durables	  and	  $2,500	  per	  year	  on	  home	  
improvement	   and	   maintenance.	   This	   home-­‐related	   spending	   constitutes	   nearly	   10%	   of	  
homeowners’	  total	  spending	  of	  $53,300.	  
We	   use	   an	   event-­‐study	   methodology	   to	   estimate	   both	   the	   timing	   and	   the	   magnitude	  
of	   spending	   responses	   after	   the	   purchase	   of	   a	   home.	   Within	   aggregate	   data,	   home	   values	  
and	   home	   purchases	   move	   in	   tandem,	   which	   complicates	   the	   separate	   identification	   of	  
home	   value	   and	   home	   purchase	   effects.2	  By	   focusing	   on	   the	   cross-­‐section	   of	   households,	  
however,	  we	  exploit	  variation	  in	  months	  after	  purchase	  among	  homeowners.	  Our	  preferred	  
specification	   makes	   use	   of	   the	   panel	   nature	   of	   the	   CE	   by	   controlling	   for	   household	   fixed	  
effects.	  These	  fixed	  effects	  narrow	  the	  identifying	  variation	  to	  within-­‐household	  differences	  
in	   time	   after	   purchase	   and	   absorb	   household-­‐level	   spending	   differences	   that	   relate,	   for	  
example,	  to	  variation	  in	  wealth,	  income,	  and	  stage	  of	  life.	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
2.	  The	  correlation	  of	  home	  sales	  and	  house	  prices	  in	  levels	  is	  between	  0.75	  and	  0.85	  and	  in	  log	  changes	  is	  
between	  0.4	  and	  0.5.	  See	  Appendix	  B	  for	  details.

We	  estimate	  that	  homebuyers	  who	  occupy	  their	  homes	  spend	  $5,900	  (measured	  in	  
2009	   dollars)	   more	   on	   home	   durables	   and	   improvements	   from	   three	   months	   before	   the	  
home	   purchase	   through	   one	   year	   after	   the	   purchase.	   This	   increase	   includes	   $2,500	   of	  
additional	   spending	   on	   home-­‐related	   durables,	   which	   nearly	   amounts	   to	   a	   tripling	   of	  
spending	   compared	   longer-­‐tenured	   owners	   $1,520	   annual	   spending	   on	   home-­‐related	  
durables.	   Recent	   homebuyers	   also	   spend	   substantially	   more	   on	   home	   improvement	   and	  
maintenance.	   These	   investments	   in	   the	   home	   more	   than	   double	   in	   the	   first	   year	   after	  
purchase,	   increasing	   by	   $3,400	   relative	   to	   longer-­‐tenured	   owners’	   average	   annual	  
investment	   of	   $2,350.	   Both	   home	   durables	   and	   investment	   spending	   spike	   particularly	   in	  
the	   first	   quarter	   following	   home	   purchase	   and	   remain	   modestly	   higher	   for	   six	   to	   nine	  
months	  after	  home	  purchase	  before	  leveling	  off	  at	  their	  long-­‐term	  average	  by	  the	  end	  of	  the	  
first	  year	  of	  ownership.	  Households	  that	  purchase	  additional	  properties—vacation	  homes	  
or	   investment	   properties—also	   boost	   spending,	   but	   by	   a	   smaller	   amount	   than	   owner-­‐
occupants.	  
Our	   analysis	   of	   building	   permits	   likewise	   shows	   a	   substantial	   increase	   in	   home	  
improvements:	  the	  estimated	  cost	  of	  permitted	  jobs	  more	  than	  doubles	  in	  the	  first	  year	  of	  
homeownership,	   increasing	   by	   $2,500.	   The	   building	   permit	   data	   allow	   further	   examination	  
of	   any	   intertemporal	   substitution	   of	   home	   improvements.	   We	   find	   that	   home	   sellers	   also	  
increase	  spending	  on	  improvements	  by	  an	  average	  of	  $770	  in	  the	  year	  before	  the	  sale.	  We	  
conclude	   that	   first-­‐year	   owners’	   improvement	   spending	   is	   incremental,	   since	   it	   does	   not	  
merely	  replace	  sellers’	  deferred	  investments.	  
In	   contrast	   to	   the	   patterns	   we	   observe	   for	   home-­‐related	   spending,	   we	   find	   that	  
spending	   on	   nondurables	   and	   durables	   unrelated	   to	   the	   home	   remain	   flat	   or	   decline	  

	  

3	  

modestly	   around	   home	   purchases.	   On	   net,	   the	   increases	   in	   home	   durables,	   improvement,	  
and	   maintenance	   spending	   are	   not	   offset	   by	   spending	   declines	   in	   other	   consumption	  
categories.	   The	   absence	   of	   spending	   increases	   unrelated	   to	   the	   home	   also	   reinforces	   a	  
causal	  interpretation	  of	  the	  main	  results.	  
The	   event-­‐study	   methodology	   is	   not	   immune	   to	   omitted	   variables	   critiques.	   For	  
instance,	   a	   shock	   that	   causes	   the	   household	   to	   buy	   a	   new	   home	   –	   such	   as	   a	   windfall	  
increase	  in	  wealth,	  a	  job	  promotion	  that	  raises	  income	  expectations,	  or	  a	  change	  in	  family	  
status,	  such	  as	  the	  birth	  of	  a	  child	  –	  may	  also	  increase	  durable	  spending	  even	  in	  the	  absence	  
of	  a	  home	  purchase.	  One	  would	  expect,	  however,	  that	  such	  omitted	  variables	  would	  cause	  
systematically	  higher	  spending,	  even	  among	  categories	  that	  are	  unrelated	  to	  the	  home.	  Yet	  
purchases	  of	  vehicles,	  jewelry,	  books,	  and	  health	  equipment	  are	  very	  similar	  between	  first-­‐
year	   and	   long-­‐tenured	   owners	   after	   accounting	   for	   household	   fixed	   effects.	   Indeed,	   only	  
audiovisual	   goods,	   which	   we	   view	   as	   home	   related	   but	   which	   the	   Bureau	   of	   Economic	  
Analysis’s	  National	  Income	  and	  Product	  Accounts	  (NIPA)	  classify	  as	  recreational,	  show	  an	  
increase	  after	  home	  purchase.	  This	  observance	  of	  spending	  increases	  so	  tightly	  associated	  
with	   the	   home	   suggests	   that	   household	   fixed	   effects	   are	   successful	   in	   absorbing	   omitted	  
variables	  in	  our	  main	  analysis.	  
The	   relationship	   between	   home	   purchases	   and	   spending	   has	   proven	   important	   in	  
the	   aggregate,	   particularly	   during	   the	   Great	   Recession.	   Figure	   I	   shows	   the	   time	   series	   for	  
home	  sales	  (in	  blue	  and	  on	  the	  left	  axis)	  and	  for	  combined	  home	  durables,	  improvement,	  
and	   maintenance	   spending	   (in	   red	   and	   on	   the	   right	   axis)	   through	   the	   Great	   Recession.	  
Home	   sales	   plunged	   by	   nearly	   50%	   between	   2005	   and	   2010,	   from	   8.36	   million	   units	   per	  
year	   to	   4.50	   million	   units	   per	   year.	   Spending	   on	   home	   durables	   and	   home	   improvement	  

	  

4	  

and	   maintenance	   also	   declined	   drastically,	   falling	   in	   real	   terms	   by	   12%	   and	   28%,	  
respectively,	   over	   the	   same	   period.	   These	   were	   some	   of	   the	   largest	   declines	   in	   spending	  
across	  all	  categories	  in	  the	  Great	  Recession.	  
Drawing	   on	   our	   event-­‐study	   estimates	   for	   spending	   after	   home	   purchase	   and	   the	  
decline	   in	   home	   sales	   from	   2005	   to	   2010,	   we	   calculate	   that	   the	   collapse	   of	   home	   purchases	  
led	   to	   a	   $14.3	   billion	   annual	   decline	   in	   spending	   and	   investment	   during	   the	   Great	  
Recession.	   This	   mechanism	   explains	   more	   than	   one-­‐third	   of	   the	   decline	   in	   spending	   on	  
home	  durables	  and	  15%	  to	  20%	  of	  the	  decline	  in	  home	  improvements	  spending,	  although	  
these	   are	   likely	   underestimates,	   particularly	   for	   spending	   on	   home	   improvements,	   given	  
our	   finding	   in	   the	   permit	   data	   that	   homeowners	   also	   spend	   money	   on	   improvement	   and	  
maintenance	  before	  marketing	  and	  selling	  a	  property.	  	  As	  a	  point	  of	  comparison,	  the	  $14.3	  
annual	  figure	  over	  three	  years	  is	  equivalent	  to	  three-­‐quarters	  of	  the	  average	  annual	  decline	  
in	  non-­‐auto	  durables	  spending	  owing	  to	  the	  decline	  in	  housing	  wealth	  from	  2006	  to	  2009	  
estimated	  by	  Mian,	  Rao,	  and	  Sufi	  (2013).	  	  
Our	   work	   relates	   to	   a	   broad	   literature	   on	   the	   relationship	   between	   the	   housing	  
market	   and	   consumption.	   Several	   papers	   have	   quantified	   this	   relationship	   and	   generally	  
find	   that	   households	   consume	   between	   four	   and	   eleven	   cents	   of	   each	   dollar	   change	   in	  
housing	   wealth.	   This	   literature	   includes	   work	   with	   regional	   variation	   by	   Case,	   Quigley,	   and	  
Shiller	  (2005,	  2012),	  Mian	  and	  Sufi	  (2011,	  2014a,	  2014b),	  and	  Mian,	  Rao,	  and	  Sufi	  (2013);	  
work	   with	   household-­‐level	   data	   by	   Hurst	   and	   Stafford	   (2004),	   Campbell	   and	   Cocco	   (2007),	  
Attansio	   et	   al.	   (2009),	   and	   Attanasio,	   Leicester,	   and	   Wakefield	   (2011);	   and	   work	   with	  
aggregate	   data	   by	   Carroll,	   Otsuka,	   and	   Slacalek	   (2011).	   In	   terms	   of	   understanding	   the	  
mechanism,	   Cooper	   (2013)	   and	   DeFusco	   (2016)	   use	   novel	   empirical	   approaches	   to	   show

that	   the	   collateral	   channel	   is	   important.	   On	   the	   theoretical	   side,	   Chen,	   Michaux,	   and	  
Roussanov	  (2013),	  Gorea	  and	  Midrigan	  (2015),	  Berger	  et	  al.	  (2015),	  and	  Kaplan,	  Mitman,	  
and	   Violante	   (2016)	   use	   calibrated	   models	   to	   inspect	   the	   mechanism,	   mainly	   focusing	   on	  
the	   collateral	   channel.	   Most	   directly	   related	   to	   this	   paper	   is	   work	   by	   Best	   and	   Kleven	  
(2016),	   who	   estimate	   the	   stimulus	   effects	   of	   changes	   in	   housing	   transaction	   taxes	   using	  
identification	  from	  tax	  notches	  in	  the	  United	  Kingdom.	  In	  an	  extension,	  they	  use	  annual	  U.K.	  
microdata	  to	  estimate	  that	  a	  housing	  purchase	  triggers	  auxiliary	  spending	  equal	  to	  5%	  of	  
the	   house’s	   price	   in	   the	   first	   year	   and	   1%	   the	   following	   year.	   Their	   analysis	   uses	   annual	  
repeated	  cross	  sections	  and	  cannot	  capture	  the	  fineness	  in	  consumption	  and	  heterogeneity	  
that	  is	  a	  focus	  of	  our	  paper.	  
Our	  paper	  also	  relates	  to	  the	  literature	  on	  the	  consumption	  of	  durables.	  Most	  of	  the	  
theoretical	   literature	   focuses	   on	   (S,s)	   adjustment	   models	   with	   fixed	   costs	   (e.g.,	   Eberly	  
1994).	   Our	   findings	   highlight	   that	   many	   durable	   goods	   purchases	   are	   complementary	   to	  
other	  goods	  or	  life	  changes,	  such	  as	  purchasing	  a	  new	  house.	  
The	  rest	  of	  the	  paper	  is	  organized	  as	  follows.	  Section	  II	  describes	  the	  data,	  summary	  
statistics,	   and	   empirical	   methodology.	   Section	   III	   presents	   the	   empirical	   results	   of	  
household	   spending	   patterns	   around	   home	   purchase	   for	   home	   durables	   and	   home	  
improvements	   and	   maintenance.	   In	   Section	   IV	   we	   discuss	   our	   empirical	   identification	  
strategy	  and	  present	  placebo	  and	  robustness	  tests.	  Section	  V	   explores	  heterogeneity	  in	  the	  
home	  purchase	  channel.	  Section	  VI	  provides	  estimates	  of	  the	  aggregate	  effect	  of	  the	  home	  
purchase	   channel	   in	   the	   expansion	   from	   2000	   to	   2005	   and	   the	   contraction	   from	   2005	   to	  
2011.	  Section	  VII	  concludes.

II.	  DATA	  AND	  METHODOLOGY	  
We	   use	   survey	   data	   on	   household	   spending	   from	   the	   Consumer	   Expenditure	  
Interview	   Survey	   (CE)	   and	   administrative	   data	   on	   building	   permits	   from	   the	   data	   analytics	  
firm	  BuildFax.	  
	  
II.A.	  Consumer	  Expenditure	  Survey	  
Our	  primary	  data	  source	  is	  the	  CE,	  which	  provides	  monthly	  panel	  data	  on	  household	  
spending	   for	   a	   random	   sample	   of	   nearly	   thirty	   thousand	   households	   per	   year.	   The	   data	   are	  
ideal	   for	   our	   study	   because	   they	   combine	   measures	   of	   household	   expenditures	   with	  
information	   on	   home	   purchase	   timing,	   home	   characteristics,	   and	   household	   mortgage	  
borrowing.	   Survey	   participants	   remain	   in	   the	   sample	   for	   one	   year	   and	   report	   their	  
expenditures	  retrospectively	  through	  four	  quarterly	  interviews.	  
We	  use	  the	  CE’s	  detailed	  data	  on	  the	  timing,	  value,	  and	  category	  of	  expenditures	  to	  
construct	   monthly	   data	   on	   purchases	   of	   durable	   goods	   and	   spending	   on	   home-­‐related	  
maintenance	  and	  improvement	  projects.	  The	  survey	  includes	  an	  extensive	  set	  of	  questions	  
about	   spending	   on	   durables,	   with	   separate	   sections	   devoted	   to	   home	   furnishings,	  
appliances	   and	   household	   equipment,	   vehicles,	   and	   home	   maintenance	   and	   improvement	  
projects.	  For	  durable	  goods	  purchased	  over	  the	  previous	  three	  months,	  households	  report	  
the	   type	   of	   product	   (e.g.,	   dining	   table	   or	   refrigerator),	   the	   price	   paid,	   and	   the	   month	   of	  
purchase.	   For	   new	   and	   used	   vehicles,	   households	   report	   the	   month	   of	   purchase,	   the	   net	  
price	  paid,	  and	  the	  value	  of	  any	  trade-­‐in.	  Finally,	  for	  home	  maintenance	  and	  improvement	  
projects,	  survey	  participants	  report	  the	  type	  of	  project	  (e.g.,	  adding	  insulation	  or	  replacing	  
siding)	   and	   their	   monthly	   spending	   on	   supplies	   and	   contractor	   labor.	   These	   projects	  

	  

7	  

include	   home	   additions	   and	   remodeling	   projects	   as	   well	   as	   repairs	   and	   maintenance	  
throughout	   the	   interior	   and	   exterior	   of	   the	   home.	   We	   deflate	   all	   expenditures	   to	   2009	  
dollars	  using	  the	  Consumer	  Price	  Index	  (CPI)	  for	  each	  spending	  category	  for	  durables	  and	  
using	  NIPA	  deflators	  for	  home	  maintenance	  and	  improvement.	  
In	  addition	  to	  tracking	  household	  spending,	  the	  survey	  gathers	  information	  on	  home	  
ownership	   that	   allows	   us	   to	   measure	   the	   time	   elapsed	   since	   home	   purchase.	   For	   each	  
home,	   including	   the	   household’s	   main	   residence	   as	   well	   as	   any	   vacation	   and	   investment	  
properties,	   the	   survey	   collects	   the	   month	   and	   year	   the	   property	   was	   acquired,	   the	  
estimated	  current	  value,	  and	  basic	  physical	  characteristics	  (e.g.,	  number	  of	  bedrooms	  and	  
bathrooms).	  For	  owner-­‐occupied	  properties,	  the	  survey	  also	  collects	  the	  age	  of	  the	  home.	  
For	  each	  household	  we	  calculate	  the	  number	  of	  months	  since	  property	  acquisition,	  taking	  
the	   minimum	   number	   of	   months	   since	   acquisition	   for	   households	   that	   own	   multiple	  
properties.	   An	   important	   feature	   of	   the	   CE	   survey	   design	   is	   that	   it	   does	   not	   follow	  
households	   that	   move	   after	   entering	   the	   sample;	   these	   households	   exit	   the	   sample	   upon	  
moving.	  As	  a	  result,	  we	  observe	  at	  most	  three	  months	  of	  expenditures	  before	  a	  move,	  with	  
pre-­‐move	   spending	   reported	   retrospectively	   by	   the	   few	   households	   that	   enter	   the	   CE	  
sample	   just	   after	   moving	   into	   their	   new	   residence.	   Our	   main	   analysis	   thus	   primarily	  
exploits	  the	  variation	  in	  time-­‐since-­‐purchase	  for	  survey	  participants	  while	  they	  remain	  at	  a	  
given	   residence.	   In	   additional	   tests,	   we	   use	   the	   pre-­‐moving	   expenditures	   to	   examine	  
intertemporal	   substitution	   in	   the	   months	   preceding	   the	   move,	   although	   confidence	  
intervals	  widen	  in	  these	  months	  because	  of	  small	  sample	  sizes.	  
	  
II.B.	  Building	  Permit	  Data	  

	  

8	  

Our	   second	   data	   source	   is	   a	   database	   of	   residential	   building	   permits	   compiled	   by	  
BuildFax.	   City	   or	   county	   agencies	   typically	   require	   homeowners	   or	   their	   contractors	   to	  
obtain	  building	  permits	  before	  making	  significant	  home	  additions	  and	  alterations.	  BuildFax	  
collects	   these	   records	   from	   permitting	   agencies	   and	   organizes	   them	   into	   property-­‐level	  
histories	   of	   permitting	   activity.	   BuildFax	   reports	   the	   number	   of	   permits,	   broken	   down	   by	  
the	   type	   of	   work:	   electrical,	   mechanical,	   plumbing,	   or	   structural.	   In	   some	   jurisdictions,	  
BuildFax	   observes	   an	   estimate	   of	   the	   building,	   electrical,	   mechanical,	   plumbing,	   and	   total	  
job	  cost.	  The	  data	  span	  1994	  to	  2013,	  with	  BuildFax’s	  coverage	  of	  permitting	  jurisdictions	  
growing	  over	  this	  time	  period	  from	  roughly	  25%	  to	  50%	  of	  U.S.	  homes.	  
We	   restrict	   our	  sample	   to	   homes	   with	   a	   sales	   transaction.	   Using	   property	   deed	   data	  
from	  DataQuick,	  we	  obtain	  the	  property	  addresses	  of	  all	  single-­‐family	  homes	  with	  a	  sales	  
transaction	  between	  2001	  and	  2013.	  BuildFax	  then	  matches	  these	  addresses	  to	  the	  permit	  
records	   in	   its	   database	   and	   returns	   a	   panel	   dataset	   with	   the	   quarterly	   permitting	   activity	  
for	   each	   property	   in	   a	   jurisdiction	   with	   data	   coverage.	   The	   matched	   BuildFax–DataQuick	  
dataset	   includes	   nine	   million	   properties	   for	   which	   there	   is	   at	   least	   one	   home	   purchase	  
transaction	  during	  our	  sample	  period.	  
The	   permit	   data	   provide	   two	   advantages	   over	   the	   CE	   data	   for	   the	   study	   of	  
residential	   improvements.	   First,	   the	   permit	   data	   afford	   more	   statistical	   power	   because	   of	  
the	  substantially	  larger	  sample	  of	  home	  transactions.	  Second,	  the	  permit	  data	  cover	  a	  wider	  
time	   window	   around	   home	   purchases.	   Whereas	   the	   CE	   data	   are	   available	   only	   three	  
months	  before	  a	  home	  purchase,	  the	  permit	  data	  enable	  the	  study	  of	  improvements	  in	  the	  
years	  and	  months	  leading	  up	  to	  a	  home	  sale.	  To	  the	  extent	  that	  sellers	  are	  also	  buyers	  of	  a	  

	  

9	  

new	   property,	   this	   wider	   time	   window	   allows	   us	   to	   evaluate	   the	   extent	   of	   intertemporal	  
substitution	  in	  improvements.	  
	  
II.C.	  Sample	  Description	  and	  Summary	  Statistics	  
Table	   I	   presents	   summary	   statistics	   for	   the	   CE	   and	   BuildFax	   samples.	   The	   table	  
reports	   household	   characteristics	   (Panel	   A),	   property	   characteristics	   (Panel	   B),	   and	  
household	  spending	  (Panel	  C)	  for	  the	  CE	  data,	  and	  it	  reports	  permitting	  activity	  (Panel	  D)	  
for	  the	  BuildFax	  data.	  
The	   CE	   sample	   includes	   all	   homeowners	   surveyed	   between	   April	   2001	   and	   March	  
2013.	   The	   sample	   includes	   660,620	   monthly	   observations	   for	   70,269	   homeowners	   with	  
non-­‐missing	  information	  on	  the	  date	  of	  home	  purchase.	  	  
As	   the	   sample	   statistics	   in	   Panel	   A	   show,	   average	   household	   annual	   income	   and	  
financial	  asset	  holdings,	  measured	  in	  2009	  dollars,	  are	  $73,516	  and	  $57,444,	  respectively.	  
In	  terms	  of	  education,	  11%	  of	  household	  heads	  in	  the	  sample	  lack	  a	  high	  school	  diploma,	  
26%	   have	   only	   a	   high	   school	   diploma,	   29%	   have	   some	   college	   education,	   21%	   have	   a	  
college	  degree,	  and	  13%	  have	  a	  graduate	  degree.	  Of	  the	  sampled	  household	  heads,	  73%	  are	  
white,	  14%	  are	  Hispanic,	  8%	  are	  black,	  and	  3%	  are	  Asian.	  Moving	  to	  marital	  status,	  65%	  of	  
the	   household	   heads	   are	   married,	   12%	   are	   divorced,	   11%	   are	   widowed,	   and	   10%	   have	  
never	   been	   married.	   The	   mean	   family	   size	   is	   2.63.	   The	   average	   age	   for	   the	   head	   of	  
household	  is	  52.9	  years,	  and	  24%	  of	  households	  have	  a	  head	  of	  household	  or	  spouse	  who	  is	  
retired.	  
Panel	  B	  reports	  summary	  statistics	  on	  property	  characteristics.	  The	  typical	  property	  
in	  our	  sample	  was	  purchased	  around	  thirteen	  years	  before	  the	  survey	  date.	  More	  than	  60%	  

	  

10	  

of	  the	  households	  have	  a	  mortgage,	  and	  about	  7%	  of	  the	  households	  have	  refinanced	  their	  
mortgage	  in	  the	  twelve	  months	  before	  the	  survey.	  The	  average	  home	  is	  thirty-­‐seven	  years	  
old	  and	  has	  three	  bedrooms	  and	  1.8	  bathrooms.	  
Panel	   C	   presents	   information	   on	   household	   spending	   that	   we	   use	   to	   construct	   our	  
dependent	  variables	  in	  the	  regression	  analysis.	  The	  CE	  expenditure	  data	  are	  detailed	  and	  
comprehensive.	   We	   classify	   spending	   as	   (1)	   home	   improvement	   and	   maintenance,	   (2)	  
home	  durables,	  (3)	  non-­‐home	  durables,	  and	  (4)	  food.	  The	  improvements	  and	  maintenance	  
variable	  includes	  all	  spending	  for	  materials,	  tools,	  and	  labor	  but	  excludes	  the	  cost	  of	  home	  
appliances,	  which	  we	  allocate	  to	  spending	  on	  home	  durables.	  The	  vast	  majority	  of	  spending	  
on	  non-­‐home	  durables,	  more	  than	  80%,	  goes	  toward	  vehicles.	  
As	   Panel	   C	   demonstrates,	   the	   average	   spending	   on	   home	   improvement	   and	  
maintenance	  is	  $209	  per	  month,	  amounting	  to	  $2,508	  per	  year,	  while	  the	  average	  spending	  
on	   home	   durables	   is	   $144	   per	   month,	   or	   $1,728	   per	   year.	   The	   other	   spending	   categories	   of	  
non-­‐home	  durables	  and	  food	  average	  $502	  and	  $612	  per	  month,	  respectively.	  Households	  
make	   home	   improvement	   expenditures	   in	   about	   17%	   of	   the	   months	   in	   our	   sample.	   They	  
purchase	  home	  durables	  more	  frequently,	  in	  47%	  of	  the	  household-­‐month	  observations	  in	  
the	  CE	  sample.	  
The	   permitting	   sample	   includes	   all	   homes	   with	   a	   sales	   transaction	   between	   2001	  
and	   2013.	   Our	   sample	   includes	   9,081,284	   million	   properties	   with	   at	   least	   one	   purchase	  
transaction	   during	   our	   sample	   period,	   with	   44.1	   quarters	   of	   BuildFax	   data	   coverage	   per	  
property	  on	  average,	  with	  a	  total	  of	  400,060,883	  property-­‐quarter	  observations.	  As	  Panel	  D	  
illustrates,	  the	  average	  property	  has	  1.85	  permits	  during	  our	  sample	  period,	  with	  a	  mean	  
count	  of	  0.31	  permits	  for	  electrical	  work,	  0.21	  permits	  for	  mechanical	  work,	  0.22	  permits	  

	  

11	  

for	   plumbing	   work,	   and	   1.11	   permits	   for	   structural	   work.	   The	   mean	   total	   job	   cost	   for	   all	  
property-­‐quarter	   observations	   in	   the	   data	   is	   $634	   per	   quarter.	   However,	   conditional	   on	  
property-­‐quarters	   with	   positive	   permit-­‐related	   expenditure,	   the	   mean	   total	   job	   cost	   is	  
$42,990.	   This	   high	   average	   job	   cost	   relative	   to	   the	   CE	   reflects	   the	   fact	   that	   building	   permits	  
are	  necessary	  for	  large	  home	  improvements	  but	  not	  for	  smaller	  improvements.	  Because	  of	  
this,	   we	   see	   the	   analysis	   of	   the	   BuildFax	   data	   as	   supportive	   of	   the	   more	   representative	  
figures	  in	  the	  CE.	  
	  
III.	  ESTIMATING	  HOME-­‐RELATED	  SPENDING	  PATTERNS	  FOLLOWING	  HOME	  PURCHASE	  
As	  highlighted	  in	  the	  Introduction,	  home	  purchases	  are	  highly	  correlated	  with	  home	  values.	  
Time-­‐series	   regressions	   using	   aggregate	   data	   fail	   to	   identify	   home	   purchase	   effects	  
separately	   from	   home	   value	   effects	   because	   of	   this	   collinearity.	   Cross-­‐sectional	   analyses	  
using	   instruments	   that	   project	   onto	   both	   price	   and	   sales	   volume,	   such	   as	   the	   Saiz	   (2010)	  
instrument,	   also	   cannot	   separate	   the	   home	   purchase	   channel	   from	   housing	   wealth	   or	  
collateral	  effects.	  
In	   this	   paper	   we	   apply	   a	   methodology	   that	   is	   in	   essence	   similar	   to	   an	   event	   study.	  
We	  use	  spending	  microdata	  at	  the	  household	  level,	  which	  provides	  additional	  variation	  to	  
identify	  home	  purchase	  effects:	  cross-­‐sectional	  variation	  in	  spending	  categories	  as	  well	  as	  
time-­‐series	  variation	  measured	  as	  time	  since	  home	  purchase.	  	  
	  
III.A.	  Average	  Consumption	  and	  Permitting	  Activity	  by	  Time	  Since	  Purchase	  
Table	   II	   provides	   a	   first	   pass	   at	   exploiting	   at	   this	   variation	   by	   showing	   average	  
monthly	   spending	   across	   the	   four	   spending	   categories	   for	   households	   in	   each	   of	   the	   four	  

	  

12	  

quarters	   since	   their	   home	   purchase	   and	   those	   households	   that	   purchased	   more	   than	   five	  
quarters	   ago.	   These	   raw	   differences	   in	   spending	   are	   not	   necessarily	   caused	   by	   home	  
purchase,	  but	  they	  provide	  a	  useful	  point	  of	  departure	  for	  the	  subsequent	  analysis.	  
Household	  spending	  patterns	  following	  home	  purchases	  are	  illustrated	  in	  Panel	  A	  of	  
Table	   II.	   Panel	   A	   reports	   average	   monthly	   spending	   across	   the	   four	   spending	   categories	  
(home	  improvement,	  home	  durables,	  non-­‐home	  durables,	  and	  food)	  in	  each	  of	  the	  first	  four	  
quarters	   following	   the	   property	   purchase.	   All	   spending	   figures	   are	   in	   real	   terms	   (2009	  
dollars)	  and	  adjusted	  for	  inflation	  using	  the	  Consumer	  Price	  Index	  for	  All	  Urban	  Consumers	  
(CPI-­‐U)	  price	  deflator.	  
As	  Panel	  A	  of	  Table	  II	  shows,	  the	  average	  monthly	  home	  improvement	  spending	  in	  
the	  first	  quarter	  after	  the	  home	  purchase	  is	  $598	  compared	  to	  the	  mean	  of	  $196	  per	  month	  
after	   the	   first	   year	   of	   ownership.	   That	   is,	   households	   spend	   three	   times	  more	   in	   each	   of	   the	  
first	   three	   months	   after	   the	   home	   purchase.	   Moreover,	   home	   improvement	   spending	  
remains	   elevated	   in	  the	  second	  quarter	   after	   the	   purchase—spending	   is	  $382	  per	   month,	  
which	  is	  nearly	  twice	  as	  large	  as	  the	  average	  spending	  beyond	  the	  first	  year	  of	  ownership.	  
Spending	   on	   home	   improvement	   also	   remains	   high	   in	   the	   third	   and	   fourth	   quarters	   after	  
the	  home	  purchase,	  at	  $325	  and	  $280	  per	  month,	  respectively.	  	  
Likewise,	  household	  spending	  on	  home	  durables	  increases	  dramatically	  in	  the	  first	  
quarter	  after	  the	  purchase	  of	  a	  property.	  As	  Table	  II	  shows,	  the	  average	  monthly	  spending	  
on	   home	   durables	   in	   the	   first	   three	   months	   after	   the	   home	   purchase	   is	   $858	   per	   month,	  
compared	  to	  a	  mean	  $127	  per	  month	  after	  one	  year	  of	  ownership,	  representing	  an	  almost	  
sevenfold	  increase	  in	  spending	  on	  home	  durables.	  The	  level	  of	  spending	  on	  home	  durables	  
remains	  higher	  than	  the	  mean	  throughout	  the	  first	  year	  after	  the	  home	  purchase.	  We	  also	  

	  

13	  

find	   an	   increase	   in	   spending	   on	   non-­‐home	   durables	   in	   the	   year	   after	   the	   home	   purchase,	  
but	   this	   increase	   is	   smaller	   than	   those	   for	   home	   improvement	   or	   home	   durables.	   For	  
example,	  spending	  on	  non-­‐home	  durables	  is	  $698	  per	  month	  in	  the	  first	  quarter	  after	  the	  
home	  purchase,	  representing	  an	  increase	  of	  41.5%	  over	  the	  $493	  per	  month	  spent	  among	  
households	   beyond	   the	   first	   year	   of	   ownership.	   Finally,	   we	   do	   not	   find	   any	   significant	  
changes	   in	   household	   spending	   on	   food	   following	   a	   home	   purchase,	   suggesting	   that	   the	  
purchase	  itself	  is	  unlikely	  to	  lead	  to	  a	  dramatic	  change	  in	  the	  household’s	  lifestyle.	  
In	   Panel	   B	   of	   Table	   II	   we	   summarize	   the	   building	   permit	   activity	   following	   home	  
purchases.	  The	  fraction	  of	  properties	  with	  at	  least	  one	  permit	  is	  7.7%	  in	  the	  first	  quarter	  
following	   a	   purchase.	   The	   incidence	   of	   permits	   then	   falls	   steadily	   during	   the	   first	   year	   of	  
ownership	   and	   reaches	   2.6%	   among	   homes	   that	   are	   more	   than	   one	   year	   beyond	   the	  
purchase	   date.	   The	   estimated	   total	   job	   cost	   displays	   a	   similar	   pattern,	   declining	   from	   an	  
average	  of	  $1,292	  in	  the	  first	  quarter	  following	  the	  purchase	  to	  $506	  per	  quarter	  beyond	  
the	  first	  year	  of	  ownership.	  
These	   raw	   differences	   in	   spending	   of	   course	   may	   reflect	   selection	   into	   who	  
purchases	   rather	   than	   spending	   caused	   by	   the	   home	   purchase	   itself.	   For	   example,	   if	  
wealthier	   households	   both	   spend	   more	   on	   food	   and	   move	   more	   often,	   we	   would	   observe	  
similar	  spending	  patterns	  even	  if	  food	  spending	  were	  unaffected	  by	  a	  home	  purchase.	  Our	  
empirical	   strategy	   aims	   to	   address	   this	   issue	   and	   provide	   a	   causal	   estimate	   of	   the	   spending	  
responses	  to	  home	  purchase.	  
	  
III.B.	  An	  Empirical	  Model	  of	  Spending	  Patterns	  

	  

14	  

The	   summary	   statistics	   presented	   above	   suggest	   that	   households	   spend	  
dramatically	   more	   on	   home	   improvement	   and	   home	   durables	   during	   the	   first	   year	   of	  
ownership.	  We	  now	  turn	  to	  a	  multivariate	  analysis	  of	  household	  spending	  and	  permitting	  
activity	  following	  home	  purchases.	  
We	   use	   an	   event-­‐study	   methodology,	   estimating	   the	   following	   regression	   model	  in	  
the	  CE	  sample:	  
1     𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔!" = 𝛼 +

!!
!!!! 𝛽! 1

𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑠  𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒  𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 = 𝑚 + 𝛿! + 𝜸′𝑿!" + 𝜀!" ,	  

where	   the	   dependent	   variable	   is	   spending	   by	   household	   i	   in	   month	   t.	   As	   measures	   of	  
spending,	   we	   consider	   alternately	   the	   level	   of	   spending	   (dollars	   per	   month),	   the	   log	   of	  
spending	   (natural	   logarithm	   of	   1	   +	   dollar	   spending),	   and	   the	   incidence	   of	   spending	   (an	  
indicator	   for	   spending	   >	   0).	   Aside	   from	   different	   scaling,	   the	   levels	   specification	   tends	   to	  
focus	  on	  fitting	  large	  expenditures,	  whereas	  the	  log	  specification	  puts	  more	  weight	  on	  small	  
purchases.	  
The	  coefficients	  of	  interest	  are	  fixed	  effects	  for	  each	  month	  relative	  to	  the	  time	  of	  the	  
home	   purchase	   ( 𝛽! , 𝑚 ∈ −3, 11 ).	   These	   fixed	   effects	   measure	   the	   household’s	  
incremental	   spending	   in	   each	   of	   the	  three	   months	  before	  the	   house	  purchase	   as	   well	   as	   the	  
first	  twelve	  months	  of	  home	  ownership	  relative	  to	  an	  excluded	  category	  of	  thirteen	  or	  more	  
months	   after	   purchase.	   The	   model	   also	   includes	   month-­‐by-­‐year	   fixed	   effects	   (𝛿! )  to	   control	  
for	   common	   variation	   in	   spending	   over	   time,	   such	   as	   fluctuations	   through	   the	   business	  
cycle.	   The	   vector	   X	   includes	   controls	   for	   household	   income	   and	   wealth,	   as	   well	   as	  
demographics:	  household	  size,	  the	  age	  of	  the	  head	  of	  household,	  and	  indicators	  for	  the	  head	  
of	  household’s	  marital	  status,	  retirement	  status,	  race,	  and	  education.	  	  

	  

15	  

Most	   important,	   our	   preferred	   specification	   makes	   use	   of	   the	   panel	   nature	   of	   the	   CE	  
by	   controlling	   for	   household	   fixed	   effects	   in	   addition	   to	   the	   control	   variables	   discussed	  
above.	   These	   fixed	   effects	   narrow	   the	   identifying	   variation	   to	   within-­‐household	   differences	  
in	  time	  after	  purchase	  and	  absorb	  household-­‐level	  spending	  differences	  that	  are	  driven	  by	  
such	  factors	  as	  wealth,	  income,	  or	  stage	  of	  life.	  	  
We	  estimate	  the	  model	  with	  ordinary	  least	  squares,	  and	  in	  robustness	  tests	  we	  show	  
similar	   findings	   for	   Probit	   and	   Tobit	   models	   designed	   for	   discrete	   and	   censored	   outcome	  
variables.	   We	   calculate	   Huber-­‐White	   standard	   errors	   with	   observations	   clustered	   by	  
household.	   Most	   of	   the	   analysis	   is	   presented	   using	   figures	   that	   plot	   the	   pattern	   in	  
household	   spending	   following	   home	   purchase	   or	   mortgage	   refinancing.	   The	   figures	   are	  
plotted	  based	  on	  the	  coefficients	  of	  the	  fixed	  effects	  for	  each	  month	  relative	  to	  the	  date	  of	  
the	   home	   purchase	   ( 𝛽! , 𝑚 ∈ −3, 11 ).	   These	   fixed	   effects	   measure	   the	   household’s	  
incremental	  spending	  in	  each	  of	  the	  three	  months	  before	  the	  purchase	  as	  well	  as	  the	  first	  
twelve	   months	   of	   home	   ownership	   relative	   to	   an	   excluded	   category	   of	   thirteen	   or	   more	  
months	  following	  the	  purchase	  after	  we	  control	  for	  property	  and	  household	  characteristics.	  
We	  estimate	  a	  similar	  model	  in	  the	  permitting	  analysis:	  
2     𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑠!" = 𝛼 +

!
!!!! 𝛽! 1

𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒  𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 = 𝑞 + 𝜹𝒕 + 𝜽𝒑 + 𝜀!" .	  

The	   unit	   of	   observation	   in	   this	   analysis	   is	   the	   property	   p	   in	   a	   quarter	   t.	   An	   important	  
feature	   of	   the	   permitting	   data	   is	   that	   we	   can	   observe	   permitting	   in	   the	   years	   before	   a	  
transaction,	   so	   we	   are	   able	   to	   expand	   the	   time-­‐relative-­‐to-­‐purchase	   dummies	   to	   include	  
each	   of	   the	   eight	  quarters	   before	   and	   after	   the	   home	   purchase.	   Even	   though	  the	   quarters	  
before	   the	   sale	   concern	   a	   different	   homeowner,	   which	   means	   that	   we	   cannot	   measure	  
intertemporal	   substitution	   for	   a	   single	   household	   with	   the	   permit	   data,	   we	   can	  

	  

16	  

nevertheless	   test	   whether	   on	   average	   sellers	   defer	   maintenance	   or	   upgrade	   their	   house	  
before	   selling.	   Because	   most	   sellers	   repurchase,	   this	   helps	   us	   assess	   intertemporal	  
substitution	  for	  permitted	  home	  improvements.	  By	  contrast,	  because	  the	  CE	  does	  not	  track	  
movers,	  we	  can	  observe	  only	  up	  to	  three	  months	  before	  a	  purchase.	  
We	   measure	   permitting	   activity	   alternately	   as	   the	   incidence	   of	   a	   permit	   (per	  
quarter),	   the	   number	   of	   permits	   (per	   quarter),	   the	   total	   estimated	   job	   cost	   (per	   quarter),	  
and	  the	  log	  of	  the	  estimated	  job	  cost	  (natural	  logarithm	  of	  1	  +	  job	  cost).	  As	  control	  variables	  
in	   some	   specifications,	   we	   include	   quarter-­‐by-­‐year	   fixed	   effects	   (𝛿! )	  and	   property	   fixed	  
effects	  (𝜃! ).	  We	  estimate	  the	  model	  with	  ordinary	  least	  squares	  and	  cluster	  observations	  by	  
property.	  
	  
III.C.	  Home	  Durable	  Spending	  Following	  Home	  Purchase	  
Table	  III	  presents	  results	  from	  estimating	  Regression	  (1)	  using	  a	  measure	  of	  home	  
durables	  spending	  as	  a	  dependent	  variable.	  As	  the	  table	  illustrates,	  there	  is	  an	  increase	  in	  
spending	  during	  the	  twelve	  months	  following	  a	  home	  purchase.	  When	  we	  do	  not	  control	  for	  
household	  or	  property	  characteristics,	  log	  spending	  increases	  by	  1.69	  log	  points	  in	  the	  first	  
month,	  1.88	  log	  points	  in	  the	  second	  month,	  and	  1.10	  log	  points	  in	  the	  third	  month.	  These	  
log	   differences	   equate	   to	   proportional	   increases	   of	   442%,	   555%,	   and	   201%,	   respectively.	  
This	   pattern	   of	   increased	   consumption	   that	   peaks	   in	   the	   second	   month	   remains	   similar	  
when	   we	   control	   for	   property	   and	   household	   characteristics	   and	   year	   fixed	   effects	   in	  
Column	  (2)	  as	  well	  as	  when	  we	  control	  for	  household	  fixed	  effects	  in	  Column	  (3).	  
Controlling	   for	   household	   characteristics	   and	   then	   household	   fixed	   effects	   reduces	  
the	   estimated	   spending	   responses	   modestly	   for	   the	   first	   few	   months	   following	   a	   home	  

	  

17	  

purchase	  and	  more	  substantially	  for	  months	  6	  to	  12	  following	  the	  purchase.	  The	  elevated	  
spending	   late	   in	   the	   first	   year	   of	   ownership—reflected	   in	   coefficients	   of	   roughly	   0.3	   for	  
months	   9	   to	   11	   of	   the	   first	   specification—falls	   by	   more	   than	   half	   after	   controlling	   for	  
household	   characteristics	   and	   then	   to	   zero	   after	   controlling	   for	   household	   fixed	   effects.	  
Some	   of	   the	   elevated	   spending	   in	   the	   first	   year	   of	   ownership	   evident	   in	   the	   raw	   data,	  
therefore,	   is	   caused	   by	   generally	   higher	   spending	   by	   households	   that	   tend	   to	   buy	   homes	  
more	  frequently	  rather	  than	  by	  a	  home	  purchase	  per	  se.	  The	  variation	  across	  specifications	  
is	   shown	   visually	   in	   Appendix	   A.	   Nevertheless,	   there	   is	   a	   substantial	   home	   durables	  
spending	   response	   in	   the	   first	   nine	   months	   after	   purchase	   even	   for	   the	   most	   stringent	  
specification	  that	  includes	  household	  fixed	  effects.	  
In	  terms	  of	  dollar	  spending,	  home	  durables	  spending	  increases	  by	  $908	  in	  the	  first	  
month	   and	   $836	   in	   the	   second	   month	   after	   a	   home	   purchase.	   In	   the	   third	   and	   the	   fourth	  
months	   after	   the	   purchase,	   spending	   increases	   by	   $349	   and	   $201,	   respectively,	   and	   it	  
increases	   by	   about	   an	   additional	   $50	   in	   each	   of	   the	   fifth	   and	   sixth	   months	   after	   the	  
purchase.	   Finally,	   in	   Column	   (5)	   of	   Table	   III	   we	   use	   the	   incidence	   of	   spending	   as	   our	  
dependent	  variable	  and	  find	  that	  the	  propensity	  to	  spend	  on	  home	  durables	  increases	  by	  
13.4%	  in	  the	  first	  month,	  16.1%	  in	  the	  second	  month,	  and	  8.3%	  in	  the	  third	  month	  after	  a	  
home	   purchase.	   The	   incidence	   of	   home	   durables	   spending	   is	   4.9%–6.3%	   	   higher	   in	   months	  
4,	  5,	  and	  6	  and	  1.9%–3.3%	  higher	  in	  in	  months	  7,	  8,	  and	  9.	  
Table	   III	   also	   presents	   household	   spending	   for	   the	   three	   months	   before	   the	   home	  
purchase.	   	   As	   the	   table	   demonstrates,	   households	   reduce	   their	   spending	   on	   home	   durables	  
in	   the	   three	   months	   before	  making	   a	   home	   purchase.	   For	   example,	   the	   propensity	   to	   spend	  
is	   13.8%,	   15.7%,	   and	   10.7%	   lower	   in	   months	   −3,	   −2,	   and	   −1	   relative	   to	   the	   home	   purchase,	  

	  

18	  

respectively.	   The	   spending	   patterns	   in	   these	   three	   months	   are	   consistent	   with	   some	  
intertemporal	   substitution	   of	   consumption	   in	   which	   both	   buyers	   and	   sellers	   in	   a	   pending	  
transaction	   may	   delay	   durable	   goods	   purchases	   and	   home	   improvements	   until	   the	  
transaction	  is	  completed.	  However,	  the	  increase	  in	  consumption	  after	  the	  purchase	  dwarfs	  
the	   decline	   before	   the	   purchase.	   In	   the	   analysis	   of	   log	   spending,	   for	   example,	   the	  
coefficients	   imply	   a	   cumulative	   spending	   difference	   of	   +6.21	   log	   points	   in	   the	   twelve	  
months	   after	   a	   purchase,	   which	   is	   three	   times	   as	   large	   as	   the	   cumulative	   −2.18	   log	   point	  
decline	  in	  the	  three	  months	  before	  the	  purchase.	  
The	  pattern	  of	  spending	  on	  home	  durables	  is	  illustrated	  in	  Figures	  II.A,	  II.B,	  and	  II.C.	  
Each	  figure	  is	  plotted	  based	  on	  the	  coefficients	  of	  the	  fixed	  effects	  for	  each	  month	  relative	  
to	   the	   date	   of	   the	   home	   purchase,	   using	   as	   dependent	   variables	   the	   logarithm	   of	   home	  
durables	  spending	  (Figure	  II.A),	  the	  dollar	  amount	  of	  home	  durables	  spending	  (Figure	  II.B),	  
or	  the	  incidence	  of	  home	  durables	  spending	  (Figure	  II.C).	  	  
	  
III.D.	  Home	  Improvement	  and	  Maintenance	  Following	  Home	  Purchase	  
We	   also	   analyze	   household	   spending	   patterns	   on	   home	   improvement	   and	  
maintenance	  and	  report	  the	  results	  in	  Table	  IV	  and	  Figures	   III.B,	  III.B,	  and	   III.C.	  As	  Table	   IV	  
demonstrates,	   we	   find	   a	   significant	   increase	   in	   home	   improvement	   and	   maintenance	  
spending	   following	   a	   home	   purchase.	   The	   incidence	   of	   home	   improvement	   spending	   is	  
10.7%	  in	  the	  month	  of	  the	  home	  purchase,	  while	  it	  is	  not	  statistically	  different	  from	  zero	  in	  
the	  three	  months	  before	  the	  purchase.	  The	  likelihood	  that	  a	  household	  will	  conduct	  home	  
improvement	   and	   maintenance	   increases	   to	   14.9%	   in	   the	   first	   month	   after	   the	   purchase	  
and	   is	   10.2%	   and	   7.0%	   in	   the	   second	   and	   third	   months,	   respectively,	   after	   the	   purchase.	  

	  

19	  

The	  magnitudes	  of	  these	  spending	  are	  also	  significant,	  amounting	  to	  an	  average	  of	  $484.80,	  
$478.70,	  and	  $301.20	  in	  each	  of	  the	  three	  months	  before	  the	  home	  purchase.	  	  
To	   gauge	   the	   total	   effect	   of	   a	   home	   purchase	   on	   spending,	   we	   analyze	   the	   combined	  
spending	   on	   durable	   goods	   as	   well	   as	   on	   home	   improvement	   and	   maintenance.	   The	   results	  
are	  presented	  in	  Table	  V	  and	  in	  Figures	  IV.A,	  IV.B,	  and	  IV.C.	  As	  Table	  V,	  Column	  (4)	  shows,	  
the	  combined	  spending	  on	  durables	  and	  home	  improvement	  and	  maintenance	  is	  $1,482	  in	  
the	  month	  of	  the	  home	  purchase.	  Spending	  remains	  high	  in	  the	  next	  three	  months,	  with	  a	  
total	  of	  $1,351	  in	  the	  first	  month	  after	  the	  purchase	  and	  $674	  and	  $469	  in	  the	  second	  and	  
third	  months	  after	  the	  purchase,	  respectively.	  
	  
III.E.	  Permitting	  Activity	  Around	  Home	  Purchases	  
Results	   from	   estimating	   Regression	   (2)	   for	   our	   analysis	   of	   building	   permits	   are	  
presented	   in	   Table	   VI.	   The	   dependent	   variable	   in	   Columns	   (1)	   to	   (3)	   is	   the	   natural	  
logarithm	  of	  1	  +	  total	  job	  cost,	  while	  in	  Columns	  (4)	  and	  (5),	  the	  dependent	  variable	  is	  the	  
actual	  job	  cost	  in	  dollars.	  Column	  (1)	  shows	  an	  increase	  of	  0.241	  log	  points	  in	  permit	  total	  
job	  cost	  during	  the	  quarter	  in	  which	  a	  home	  is	  purchased,	  or	  an	  increase	  of	  27.3%	  in	  permit	  
cost.	  The	  estimated	  job	  cost	  is	  also	  0.181	  and	  0.094	  log	  points	  higher	  in	  the	  first	  and	  second	  
quarters	   after	   the	   purchase,	   representing	   proportional	   increases	   of	   19.8%	   and	   9.9%,	  
respectively.	  The	  pattern	  of	  increased	  job	  cost	  during	  the	  quarter	  of	  the	  home	  purchase	  and	  
the	   following	   two	   quarters	   also	   remains	   similar	   when	   we	   control	   for	   year	   fixed	   effects	  in	  
Column	  (2)	  and	  property	  and	  year	  fixed	  effects	  in	  Column	  (3).	  
In	  terms	  of	  actual	  job	  cost,	  the	  average	  increases	  by	  $763	  during	  the	  quarter	  of	  the	  
home	  purchase	  and	  by	  $835	  in	  the	  first	  quarter	  after	  the	  purchase.	  In	  the	  second	  and	  the	  

	  

20	  

third	   quarters	   after	   the	   purchase,	   the	   average	   job	   cost	   increases	   by	   $561	   and	   $365,	  
respectively,	   and	   it	   increases	   by	   an	   additional	   $223	   in	   the	   fourth	   quarter	   after	   the	  
purchase,	  as	  shown	  in	  Column	  (4).	  Interestingly,	  permit	  job	  costs	  also	  increase	  before	  the	  
purchase,	   suggesting	   that	   home	   sellers	   invest	   in	   their	   homes	   before	   selling.	   This	   reveals	  
that	   households	   that	   are	   both	   buyers	   and	   sellers	   do	   not	   intertemporally	   substitute	   by	  
deferring	  maintenance	  on	  their	  old	  home	  before	  purchasing	  a	  new	  home	  and	  investing	  in	  it.	  
It	  also	  suggests	  that	  if	  anything	  our	  estimate	  of	  home	  improvement	  and	  maintenance	  in	  the	  
CE	  is	  an	  underestimate	  because	  it	  does	  not	  fully	  account	  for	  upgrades	  made	  before	  a	  sale	  
that	  occur	  more	  than	  three	  months	  before	  the	  purchase.	  
Finally,	  in	  Column	  (5)	  of	  Table	  VI	  we	  use	  the	  incidence	  of	  having	  any	  permit	  as	  our	  
dependent	   variable	   and	   find	   that	   the	   likelihood	   of	   having	   a	   permit	   increases	   by	   5.5%	  
during	  the	  quarter	  of	  the	  home	  purchase,	  followed	  by	  a	  3.5%	  increase	  in	  the	  first	  quarter	  
after	   the	   purchase	   and	   1.9%	   and	   1.3%	   increases	   respectively	   in	   the	   second	   and	   third	  
quarters	  after	  the	  purchase.	  	  
The	   permit	   data	   overall	   corroborate	   the	   results	   from	   the	   CE.	   Although	   we	   do	   not	  
wish	   to	   take	   a	   strong	   stand	   on	   aggregate	   dollar	   values,	   given	   that	   not	   all	   home	  
improvements	  require	  a	  permit,	  the	  general	  time	  pattern	  is	  highly	  consistent	  with	  what	  we	  
see	   in	   the	   consumer	   survey,	   and	   a	   two-­‐year	   look-­‐back	   produces	   no	   evidence	   consistent	  
with	  intertemporal	  substitution.	  	  
	  
IV.	  CAUSALITY	  AND	  ROBUSTNESS	  
The	   results	   so	   far	   suggest	   that	   households	   increase	   their	   spending	   on	   home	  
durables,	  improvement,	  and	  maintenance	  when	  they	  purchase	  a	  house.	  The	  evidence	  sheds	  

	  

21	  

light	   on	   the	   link	   between	   the	   housing	   market	   and	   private	   consumption	   through	   a	  
transaction	  –	  rather	  than	  price	  –	  channel.	  However,	  it	  is	  important	  to	  explore	  more	  deeply	  
whether	   these	   effects	   are	   causal	   or	   whether	   unobserved	   heterogeneity	   at	   the	   household	  
level	  is	  driving	  the	  results.	  Our	  regressions	  control	  for	  household	  income	  and	  wealth	  and	  
various	   demographics:	   household	   size	   and	   head	   of	   household	   age,	   marital	   status,	  
retirement	   status,	   race,	   and	   education.	   Our	   results	   are	   robust	   to	   the	   inclusion	   of	   household	  
fixed	   effects,	   which	   absorb	   fixed	   differences	   in	   expenditures	   during	   the	   year	   that	   the	  
household	  appears	  in	  the	  data.	  
By	  including	  household	  fixed	  effects	  we	  exploit	  the	  exact	  timing	  of	  spending	  rather	  
than	  relying	  on	  a	  coarse	  comparison	  between	  households	  that	  recently	  purchased	  a	  home	  
and	  those	  that	  did	  not.	  To	  clarify	  this	  point,	  it	  is	  helpful	  to	  consider	  the	  example	  of	  elderly	  
homeowners,	   who	   tend	   to	   stay	   in	   the	   same	   home	   and	   to	   keep	   their	   current	   household	  
appliances.	  A	  model	  without	  controls	  or	  household	  fixed	  effects	  would	  find	  higher	  spending	  
on	  durables	  in	  each	  month	  during	  the	  first	  year	  of	  ownership,	  since	  the	  elderly	  spend	  at	  a	  
low	   rate	   and	   are	   disproportionately	   represented	   in	   the	   excluded	   category:	   owners	   who	  
purchased	   more	   than	   one	   year	   ago.	   Omitting	   age	   from	   the	   model	   causes	   an	   upward	   bias	   in	  
the	  spending	  coefficients	  across	  the	  board	  in	  each	  of	  the	  first	  twelve	  months	  after	  purchase.	  
Controlling	   for	   age,	   or,	   more	   flexibly,	   absorbing	   unobserved	   heterogeneity	   with	   a	  
household	  fixed	  effect,	  resolves	  this	  problem.	  
It	   is	   still	   possible,	   however,	   that	   unobserved	   shocks	   that	   coincide	   with	   (and	   may	  
potentially	   drive)	   home	   purchase	   lead	   to	   increased	   spending	   precisely	   in	   the	   first	   few	  
months	  after	  the	  purchase.	  These	  potential	  omitted	  variables	  may	  include:	  (1)	  unobserved	  
financial	   or	   housing	   wealth	   that	   permits	   higher	   spending;	   (2)	   an	   increase	   in	   permanent	  

	  

22	  

income	   that	   may	   result	   in	   an	   increased	   propensity	   to	   consume;	   and	   (3)	   an	   increase	   in	  
family	  size	  that	  requires	  greater	  spending	  on	  durables	  and	  may	  also	  cause	  the	  household	  to	  
move.	  
We	  next	  consider	  a	  series	  of	  placebo	  tests	  to	  alleviate	  concerns	  that	  our	  results	  are	  
driven	   by	   omitted	   factors	   unrelated	   to	   the	   home	   purchase.	   To	   test	   whether	   omitted	  
variables	   are	   driving	   our	   results,	   we	   investigate	   whether	   household	   spending	   in	   categories	  
unrelated	  to	  home	  purchase	  display	  the	  same	  patterns	  as	  spending	  on	  home	  durables	  and	  
home	   improvement	   and	   maintenance.	   Using	   information	   provided	   in	   the	   CE,	   we	   study	  
spending	  on	  non-­‐home	  durables,	  food,	  and	  entertainment.	  
Figures	   V.A,	   V.B,	   and	   V.C	   show	   spending	   patterns	   for	   non-­‐home	   durables	   (Figure	  
5.A),	   food	   (Figure	   V.B),	   and	   entertainment	   (Figure	   V.C)	   corresponding	   to	   fixed	   effects	   in	  
Regression	  (1).3	  As	  the	  figures	  demonstrate,	  there	  is	  no	  significant	  change	  in	  consumption	  
patterns	   in	   any	   of	   these	   categories.	   We	   find	   a	   very	   modest	   response	   of	   spending	   on	   non-­‐
home	   durables	   and	   no	   response	   of	   spending	   on	   food	   or	   entertainment	   in	   the	   months	  
following	  home	  purchase.	  If	  any	  wealth,	  income,	  or	  household	  size	  shocks	  coincided	  with	  
home	  purchases	  and	  caused	  short-­‐run	  increases	  in	  spending,	  one	  would	  expect	  them	  also	  
to	   boost	   non-­‐housing	   spending.	   Instead,	   we	   find	   much	   a	   larger	   response	   of	   home-­‐related	  
spending.	   We	   should	   also	   note	   here	   that	   non-­‐home	   durables	   and	   food	   spending	   are	   not	  
insensitive	   to	   income	   and	   wealth	   –	   coefficients	   on	   those	   controls	   show	   the	   expected	  
relationship.	   The	   failure	   to	   find	   a	   non-­‐housing	   and	   non-­‐durable	   spending	   response	   thus	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
3.	  The	  figures	  are	  constructed	  from	  regressions	  that	  use	  the	  logarithm	  of	  the	  expenditure	  as	  a	  dependent	  
variable.	  Figures	  that	  use	  the	  actual	  dollar	  cost	  look	  similar	  and	  can	  be	  found	  in	  Appendix	  A.

does	   not	   result	   from	   any	   general	   inelasticity	   of	   these	   spending	   categories	   to	   income	   and	  
wealth.	  
	  
V.	  HETEROGENEITY	  IN	  THE	  HOME	  PURCHASE	  CHANNEL	  
The	   richness	   of	   our	   data	   allows	   us	   to	   explore	   heterogeneity	   in	   the	   home	   purchase	  
channel	  to	  provide	  more	  texture	  on	  how	  it	  operates.	  
	  
V.A.	  Maintenance	  Versus	  Customization	  
To	   aggregate	   our	   results,	   it	   is	   necessary	   to	   determine	   the	   counterfactual	   level	   of	  
house-­‐related	   consumption	   that	   would	   occur	   absent	   a	   transaction.	   To	   aid	   with	   this	  
counterfactual,	   it	   is	   useful	   to	   divide	   house-­‐related	   consumption	   into	   two	   categories:	  
“customization”	  is	  directly	  related	  to	  the	  tastes	  of	  the	  new	  homeowner	  and	  would	  not	  occur	  
without	  a	  sale;	  by	  contrast,	  “maintenance”	  may	  occur	  at	  the	  transaction	  date	  because	  it	  is	  
most	  conveniently	  done	  when	  the	  house	  changes	  hands,	  and	  some	  of	  this	  maintenance	  may	  
occur	  to	  some	  extent	  absent	  a	  transaction.	  
Two	  features	  of	  our	  data	  suggest	  that	  the	  home	  purchase	  channel	  consists	  primarily	  
of	  spending	  on	  customization,	  not	  maintenance.	  First,	  if	  maintenance	  were	  important,	  one	  
would	  expect	  to	  see	  evidence	  of	  intertemporal	  substitution	  in	  the	  CE	  or	  permit	  data.	  That	  
we	   do	   not	   observe	   such	   substitution	   suggests	   that	   maintenance	   that	   is	   performed	  
concurrent	  with	  a	  transaction	  is	  small.	  
Second,	  we	  evaluate	  whether	  our	  effect	  changes	  with	  sales	  volume	  by	  splitting	  our	  
sample	  into	  a	  boom	  period	  with	  high	  sales	  from	  2001	  to	  2005	  and	  a	  bust	  period	  with	  low	  
sales	   from	   2007	   to	   2012.	   If	   the	   maintenance	   story	   were	   quantitatively	   important,	   we	  

	  

24	  

should	  observe	  a	  substantially	  larger	  impulse	  response	  when	  transaction	  volume	  is	  lower,	  
since	   more	   maintenance	   would	   be	   done	   when	   properties	   transact	   if	   they	   turn	   over	   less	  
often.	  Although	  several	  things	  likely	  changed	  between	  2001–2005	  and	  2007–2012	  beyond	  
transaction	  volume,	  comparing	  the	  boom	  and	  bust	  provides	  a	  coarse	  sense	  of	  whether	  the	  
impulse	  response	  is	  larger	  when	  transaction	  volume	  is	  lower.	  
Figure	   VI	   shows	   the	   impulse	   responses	   for	   the	   boom	   and	   bust	   separately.	   For	  
spending	   on	   home	   durables,	   the	   boom	   and	   bust	   appear	   almost	   indistinguishable,	  
suggesting	  that	  the	  vast	  majority	  of	  this	  spending	  is	  customization.	  For	  home	  improvement	  
and	  maintenance	  spending,	  the	  effect	  is	  about	  50%	  larger	  in	  the	  bust	  than	  in	  the	  boom.	  This	  
suggests	  that	  at	  most	  a	  third	  of	  the	  home	  improvement	  and	  maintenance	  spending	  in	  our	  
baseline	  results	  is	  caused	  by	  maintenance.4	  Overall,	  our	  comparison	  of	  the	  boom	  and	  bust	  
periods	  suggests	  that	  the	  majority	  of	  spending	  that	  occurs	  after	  home	  purchase	  would	  not	  
occur	  absent	  a	  transaction.	  	  
	  
V.B.	  Additional	  Dimensions	  of	  Heterogeneity	  
	  

Table	   VII	   assesses	   several	   dimensions	   of	   heterogeneity	   in	   the	   home	   purchase	  

channel	  by	  reporting	  the	  cumulative	  change	  in	  log	  consumption	  from	  three	  months	  before	  
a	  home	  purchase	  through	  twelve	  months	  after	  the	  purchase.	  We	  report	  results	  from	  the	  log	  
specification	   because	   it	   makes	   it	   easier	   to	   compare	   effects	   for	   subgroups	   with	   different	  
baseline	  spending	  and	  because	  it	  is	  less	  sensitive	  to	  outliers	  when	  sample	  sizes	  get	  small.	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4.	  We	  consider	  this	  an	  upper	  bound	  because	  there	  were	  so	  many	  more	  foreclosure	  sales	  in	  the	  bust	  and	  
foreclosures	  typically	  require	  more	  maintenance.

The	   first	   three	   splits	   are	   by	   characteristics	   of	   the	   purchased	   home.	   We	   find	   that	  

there	  are	  larger	  responses	  for	  larger	  homes	  in	  terms	  of	  bedrooms	  and,	  to	  a	  lesser	  extent,	  
home	  value.	  In	  terms	  of	  home	  age,	  improvement	  and	  maintenance	  expenditures	  are	  lower	  –	  
but	   not	   zero	   –	   for	   newer	   homes,	   suggesting	   that	   there	   is	   still	   some	   customization	   of	   brand-­‐
new	  homes.	  Home	  improvement	  and	  maintenance	  spending	  is	  highest	  for	  older	  homes,	  as	  
one	   might	   expect.	   Home	   durables	   spending	   –	   being	   higher	   for	   homes	   that	   are	   fewer	   than	  
ten	   years	   old	   –	   go	   the	   other	   way,	   providing	   some	   speculative	   evidence	   that	   home	  
improvement	   and	   maintenance	   and	   home	   durables	   spending	   substitute	   for	   one	   another,	  
leading	  to	  an	  aggregate	  effect	  that	  is	  larger	  for	  older	  homes,	  but	  not	  by	  very	  much.	  
	  

The	  final	  three	  splits	  are	  by	   homeowner	   characteristics.	   We	   find	   that	   the	   results	   for	  

home	  durables	  spending	  are	  very	  similar	  for	  homeowners	  age	  thirty-­‐five	  or	  younger,	  who	  
are	   more	   likely	   to	   be	   first-­‐time	   homeowners,	   relative	   to	   homeowners	   who	   are	   thirty-­‐six	   or	  
older.	   By	   contrast,	   younger	   homeowners	   spend	   much	   less	   on	   home	   improvement	   and	  
maintenance,	  which	  likely	  relates	  to	  the	  results	  on	  home	  size.	  Spending	  in	  both	  categories	  
is	   higher	   for	   lower-­‐income	   and	   lower-­‐asset	   households,	   mostly	   because	   they	   have	   lower	  
initial	   spending,	   so	   the	   same	   dollar	   change	   leads	   to	   a	   larger	   log	   change	   in	   spending.	   This	  
suggests	  that	  budget	  and	  financial	  constraints	  do	  not	  limit	  the	  effect	  of	  the	  home	  purchase	  
channel.	  
	  
V.C.	  Summary	  of	  Cumulative	  Effect	  of	  Home	  Purchase	  on	  Spending	  
Figure	   VII	   summarizes	   our	   overall	   results	   by	   showing	   the	   impulse	   response	   of	  
spending	   in	   dollars	   by	   category	   as	   well	   as	   the	   same	   figure	   for	   cumulative	   spending	   by	  
category.	   As	   discussed	   above,	   the	   increases	   in	   spending	   on	   home	   durables	   and	   home

improvement	  and	  maintenance	  following	  purchase	  dwarf	  the	  declines	  in	  these	  series	  and	  
on	   non-­‐home	   durables	   spending	   before	   purchase.	   Cumulatively,	   the	   increase	   in	   spending	  
from	   three	   months	   before	   purchase	   until	   twelve	   months	   after	   is	   about	   $3,500	   for	   home	  
improvement	   and	   about	   $2,500	   for	   home	   durables,	   with	   a	   $1,000	   decline	   in	   non-­‐home	  
durables	  spending.	  	  The	  aggregate	  effect	  is	  thus	  about	  $5,000	  for	  the	  purchase	  of	  primary	  
residences.	  These	  effects	  are	  somewhat	  smaller	  for	  secondary	  residences,	  so	  the	  aggregate	  
cumulative	   effect	   unconditional	   on	   whether	   the	   residence	   is	   primary	   or	   secondary	   is	  
$3,700.	  
	  
VI.	  THE	  AGGREGATE	  EFFECT	  OF	  THE	  HOME	  PURCHASE	  CHANNEL	  FROM	  2000	  TO	  2011	  
In	   this	   section,	   we	   assess	   how	   much	   the	   home	   purchase	   channel	   contributed	   to	  
changes	  in	  consumption	  in	  the	  housing	  boom	  from	  2000	  to	  2005	  and	  the	  ensuing	  bust	  from	  
2005	   to	   2011.	   To	   do	   so,	   we	   compare	   the	   change	   in	   consumption	   that	   one	   would	   predict	   by	  
multiplying	   the	   change	   in	   home	   sales	   by	   our	   preferred	   estimates	   of	   the	   effect	   of	   a	   home	  
purchase	   on	   consumption	   in	   each	   category	   to	   the	   actual	   change	   in	   consumption	   in	   that	  
category	  in	  the	  CE.5,6	  This	  provides	  a	  simple,	  partial	  equilibrium	  accounting,	  similar	  to	  the	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
5.	  We	  do	  not	  compare	  to	  NIPA	  tables	  because	  NIPA	  uses	  different	  definitions	  that	  make	  it	  difficult	  to	  compare	  
levels	  changes.	  This	  problem	  is	  particularly	  acute	  for	  home	  maintenance,	  repair,	  and	  improvement,	  because	  
these	  CE	  categories	  are	  split	  across	  residential	  investment,	  “other	  services”	  in	  personal	  consumption,	  and	  
“imputed	  rent”	  in	  personal	  consumption.	  
6.	  One	  may	  worry	  that	  our	  effects	  overstate	  the	  aggregate	  consumption	  change	  because	  households	  sell	  home	  
durables	  around	  a	  sale,	  and	  so	  some	  of	  the	  durables	  consumption	  is	  canceled	  out	  in	  the	  aggregate	  by	  sales	  of	  
durables.	  However,	  we	  find	  no	  evidence	  of	  increased	  household	  income	  from	  sales	  of	  goods	  around	  a	  home	  
sale	  in	  the	  CE.	  We	  thus	  conclude	  that	  our	  estimates	  do	  not	  overstate	  the	  aggregate	  change	  in	  consumption	  for	  
this	  reason.

literature	   on	   housing	   wealth	   effects,	   that	   assesses	   how	   much	   of	   the	   observed	   change	   in	  
consumption	  can	  be	  accounted	  for	  by	  the	  home	  purchase	  channel.	  
To	   create	   the	   national	   time	   series	   for	   consumption	   and	   home	   improvement	   and	  
maintenance,	   we	   aggregate	   the	   CE	   using	   the	   provided	   sample	   weights.	   We	   deflate	  
subcategories	   of	   durable	   consumption	   by	   their	   subcategory	   CPI	   deflator	   and	   subcategories	  
of	   improvement	   and	   maintenance	   by	   their	   NIPA	   deflator.	   For	   home	   sales,	   we	   use	   non-­‐
seasonally	   adjusted	   data	   on	   existing	   home	   sales	   for	   the	   entire	   United	   States	   from	   the	  
National	   Association	   of	   Realtors	   together	   with	   monthly,	   non-­‐seasonally	   adjusted	   data	   on	  
sales	   of	   new	   homes	   from	   the	   Census	   Bureau.	   These	   data	   provide	   a	   more	   accurate	   time	  
series	   of	   home	   sales	   than	   home	   sales	   aggregated	   using	   the	   CE	   weights,	   although	  
reassuringly	  the	  two	  series	  are	  quite	  consistent.	  This	  is	  the	  case	  because	  these	  categories	  
had	   lower	   inflation	   than	   the	   aggregate	   CPI	   in	   the	   boom	   but	   higher	   inflation	   than	   the	  
aggregate	   in	   the	   bust.	   Consequently,	   deflating	   by	   category	   price	   indices	   leads	   to	   a	   larger	  
run-­‐up	  in	  consumption	  in	  the	  boom	  and	  a	  smaller	  decline	  in	  consumption	  in	  the	  bust.	  We	  
multiply	  the	  monthly	  time	  series	  by	  our	  preferred	  estimates	  of	  average	  dollar	  spending	  in	  
the	  three	  months	  before	  purchase,	  the	  month	  of	  purchase,	  and	  each	  of	  the	  following	  twelve	  
months	   and	   then	   aggregate	   the	   implied	   time	   series	   to	   the	   annual	   level.	   We	   next	   take	  
differences	  between	  2000–2002	  and	  2005	  for	  the	  boom	  as	  well	  as	  2005	  to	  2008–2011	  for	  
the	   bust.	   We	   then	   divide	   this	   change	   by	   the	   actual	   change	   in	   the	   aggregate	   consumption	  
time	   series	   for	   the	   same	   category	   created	   using	   the	   CE	   microdata	   and	   weights,	   which	   gives	  
us	  the	  percentage	  of	  the	  aggregate	  change	  explained	  by	  the	  home	  purchase	  channel.	  We	  use	  
2005	  as	  our	  base	  year	  because	  home	  sales	  peaked	  in	  2005.

Our	  results	  are	  shown	  in	  Table	  VIII,	  with	  the	  boom	  above	  the	  horizontal	  line	  and	  the	  
bust	   below	   the	   horizontal	   line.	   Our	   results	   are	   generally	   stronger	   for	   the	   bust	   than	   the	  
boom	  for	  two	  reasons.	  First,	  home	  sales	  fell	  more	  in	  the	  bust	  than	  they	  rose	  in	  the	  boom.	  
Second,	  home	  durables	  consumption	  –	  and	  to	  a	  lesser	  extent	  the	  other	  categories	  –	  grew	  by	  
more	  in	  the	  boom	  than	  it	  shrank	  in	  the	  bust,	  so	  the	  denominator	  is	  bigger	  in	  the	  boom	  than	  
the	  bust.	  
Column	   (1)	   of	   Table	   VIII	   shows	   that	   in	   the	   boom	   the	   home	   purchase	   channel	  
accounted	  for	  about	  8.5%	  to	  9.0%	  of	  the	  growth	  in	  spending	  on	  home	  durables,	  while	  in	  the	  
bust	   the	   home	   purchase	   channel	   contributed	   23%	   to	   39%	   percent	   of	   the	   decline	   in	  
spending	   on	   home	   durables.7	  The	   home	   purchase	   channel	   has	   a	   small	   negative	   effect	   on	  
non-­‐home	   durables	   spending,	   mostly	   because	   households	   cut	   back	   slightly	   on	   non-­‐home	  
durables	  spending	  in	  the	  months	  preceding	  a	  move.	  Column	  (4)	  shows	  the	  effect	  on	  home	  
improvements	   spending,	   which	   was	   7.4%	   to	   9.3%	   in	   the	   boom	   and	   13%	   to	   19%	   percent	   in	  
the	  bust.	  Maintenance	  is	  a	  much	  more	  erratic	  time	  series,	  particularly	  in	  the	  boom,	  but	  we	  
can	   see	   a	   10%	   to	   40%	   effect	   in	   the	   bust,	   as	   shown	   in	   Column	   (5).	   Column	   (6)	   combines	  
improvements	   and	   maintenance	   spending,	   finding	   slightly	   higher	   numbers	   when	  
maintenance	  is	  added	  than	  for	  improvements	  alone.	  
The	  categories	  of	  spending	  affected	  by	  the	  home	  purchase	  channel	  are	  only	  part	  of	  
overall	  durables	  and	  home	  maintenance	  spending.	  To	  show	  the	  effect	  of	  the	  home	  purchase	  
channel	  on	  these	  larger	  categories,	  Table	  VIII	  shows	  the	  aggregate	  effect	  of	  these	  declines	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
7.	  The	  differences	  between	  2005–2008,	  2009,	  2010,	  and	  2011	  can	  largely	  be	  ascribed	  to	  the	  time	  path	  of	  the	  
denominator.	  This	  is	  because	  home	  sales	  fall	  from	  2005	  to	  2008	  and	  then	  stay	  at	  roughly	  the	  same	  low	  level,	  
while	  home	  durables	  consumption	  continues	  to	  decline	  slightly	  until	  2009,	  after	  which	  it	  begins	  to	  rebound.	  
Similar	  patterns	  can	  be	  seen	  for	  the	  other	  variables.

on	   total	   durables	   in	   Column	   (3)	   and	   on	   total	   durables	   plus	   home	   improvements	   and	  
maintenance	   in	   Column	   (7).	   In	   the	   boom,	   the	   aggregate	   effect	   on	   total	   durables	   spending	  
was	   1.5%	   to	   2.0%,	   rising	   to	   3.7%	   to	   4.8%	   when	   spending	   on	   maintenance	   and	  
improvements	   is	   added.	   In	   the	   bust,	   the	   effect	   on	   total	   durables	   spending	   was	   2.7%	   to	  
3.6%,	  rising	  to	  6.6%	  to	  9.1%	  when	  spending	  on	  maintenance	  and	  improvements	  is	  added.	  
Note	   that	   these	   figures	   are	   likely	   underestimates	   for	   the	   impact	   of	   home	   transactions	   on	  
maintenance	   and	   improvements	   spending,	   because	   the	   CE	   design	   precludes	   us	   from	  
accounting	  for	  improvements	  made	  by	  sellers	  in	  order	  to	  market	  and	  sell	  their	  house.	  
To	   provide	   a	   sense	   of	   the	   magnitude	   of	   this	   effect,	   the	   average	   home	   purchase	  
triggers	  a	  net	  spending	  of	  $3,700	  on	  durables,	  home	  improvement,	  and	  maintenance	  from	  
three	  months	  before	  purchase	  to	  one	  year	  after	  purchase,8	  and	  from	  2005	  to	  2010	  sales	  fell	  
by	   3.86	   million	   units.	   This	   implies	   an	   annual	   decline	   in	   spending	   of	   approximately	   $14.3	  
billion,	  or	  approximately	  0.1%	  of	  GDP.	  As	  a	  yardstick	  for	  comparison,	  Mian,	  Rao,	  and	  Sufi	  
(2013)	   find	   that	   home	   equity	   fell	   by	   $5.6	   trillion	   from	   2006	   to	   2009	   and	   find	   a	   marginal	  
propensity	   to	   consume	   (MPC)	   metric	   out	   of	   housing	   wealth	   of	   5.4%,	   implying	   a	   total	  
decline	  in	  consumption	  of	  $302.4	  billion,	  with	  $128.8	  billion	  accounted	  for	  by	  autos,	  $89.6	  
billion	  by	  non-­‐durables,	  and	  $61.6	  billion	  by	  non-­‐auto	  durables.	  Our	  annual	  effect	  of	  $14.3	  
billion	  over	  three	  years	  is	  thus	  equivalent	  to	  roughly	  three-­‐quarters	  of	  Mian,	  Rao,	  and	  Sufi’s

VII.	  CONCLUSION	  
	  

This	   paper	   describes	   and	   quantifies	   a	   new	   channel	   for	   the	   causal	   relationship	  

between	   housing	   markets	   and	   spending:	   the	   home	   purchase	   channel.	   In	   the	   months	   before	  
and	  in	  the	  year	  following	  a	  home	  purchase,	  households	  spend	  $3,700,	  primarily	  on	  home-­‐
related	   durable	   goods	   and	   home	   maintenance	   and	   repair.	   To	   address	   concerns	   that	   this	  
relationship	   is	   driven	   by	   unobserved	   heterogeneity,	   we	   use	   an	   event-­‐study	   design	   that	  
includes	   household-­‐level	   fixed	   effects,	   so	   that	   all	   identification	   comes	   from	   a	   variation	  
within	   households	   before	   and	   after	   a	   home	   purchase.	   To	   address	   concerns	   that	   the	  
spending	   is	   caused	   by	   an	   event	   that	   triggers	   a	   home	   purchase	   rather	   than	   the	   home	  
purchase	   itself,	   we	   show	   that	   there	   is	   no	   related	   effect	   for	   food	   or	   entertainment	   spending,	  
and	   a	   modest	   offsetting	   effect	   for	   non-­‐home	   durable	   goods	   spending	   (included	   in	   the	  
$3,700	  figure	  above).	  	  
	  

This	   channel	   played	   a	   quantitatively	   sizable	   role	   in	   in	   the	   Great	   Recession	   and	   a	  

more	  modest	  role	  in	  the	  prior	  housing	  boom.	  It	  accounted	  for	  a	  third	  of	  the	  decline	  in	  home	  
durable	   goods	   spending	   during	   the	   Great	   Recession	   and	   a	   fifth	   of	   the	   decline	   in	   home	  
improvement	   and	   maintenance	   spending.	   A	   back-­‐of-­‐the-­‐envelope	   calculation	   implies	   that	  
the	   home	   purchase	   channel	   accounted	   for	   a	   $14.3	   billion	   –	   or	   0.1%	   of	   GDP	   –	   decline	   in	  
spending	  per	  year	  in	  the	  Great	  Recession.	  
The	  home	  purchase	  channel	  complements	  the	  response	  of	  consumption	  to	  changes	  
in	  housing	  wealth	  driven	  by	  house	  prices	  that	  has	  been	  the	  focus	  of	  recent	  literature	  (e.g.,	  
Mian,	   Rao,	   and	   Sufi	   2013).	   Appendix	   A	   shows	   that	   changes	   in	   housing	   prices	   and	   sales	  
volume	  are	  highly	  correlated,	  both	  in	  levels	  and	  in	  log	  changes.	  The	  home	  purchase	  channel	  
is	  quantitatively	  smaller	  than	  the	  housing	  wealth	  channel	  because	  it	  only	  affects	  non-­‐auto	  

	  

31	  

durables	  spending,	  but	  for	  these	  categories	  it	  is	  substantial:	  the	  magnitude	  of	  our	  effect	  is	  
equivalent	   to	   three-­‐quarters	   of	   the	   causal	   effect	   of	   the	   2006–2009	   change	   in	   housing	  
wealth	  on	  non-­‐auto	  durables	  consumption	  estimated	  by	  Mian,	  Rao,	  and	  Sufi	  (2013).	  
	  

Beyond	   understanding	   the	   mechanisms	   connecting	   the	   housing	   market	   and	  

spending	   in	   the	   Great	   Recession,	   our	   estimates	   are	   of	   relevance	   to	   policy	   makers.	   To	   the	  
extent	   that	   monetary	   policy	   is	   passed	   through	   into	   mortgage	   interest	   rates,	   monetary	  
policy	   can	   have	   a	   substantial	   impact	   on	   housing	   transaction	   volume.	   Our	   estimates	   are	   a	  
crucial	  input	  for	  monetary	  policy	  makers	  who	  wish	  to	  understand	  the	  effect	  of	  these	  sales	  
on	  durables	  and	  home	  improvement	  spending.	  In	  addition,	  our	  figures	  are	  a	  crucial	  input	  
into	   the	   cost-­‐benefit	   analysis	   for	   fiscal	   policy	   makers	   interested	   in	   pursuing	   policies	  
designed	   to	   stimulate	   home	   sales,	   such	   as	   the	   new	   homebuyer	   tax	   credit	   in	   the	   Great	  
Recession	  (Berger	  et	  al.	  2016).

Note:	   Each	   cell	   reflects	   the	   fraction	   of	   the	   total	   change	   in	   a	   consumption	   category	   for	   a	   given	   time	   period	  
explained	   by	   the	   home	   purchase	   channel,	   computed	   by	   multiplying	   the	   change	   in	   home	   sales	   for	   the	   time	  
period	  by	  our	  preferred	  estimate	  of	  the	  dollar	  amount	  of	  consumption	  associated	  with	  a	  home	  purchase.	  For	  
the	   preferred	   estimate	   and	   the	   consumption	   time	   series	   used	   in	   the	   denominator,	   the	   CE	   data	   is	   deflated	   by	   a	  
category-­‐level	  deflator	  from	  the	  CPI	  (for	  durables),	  NIPA	  (for	  home	  improvements,	  and	  this	  same	  deflator	  is

on	   the	   total	   change	   in	   a	   consumption	   category	   for	   a	   given	   time	   period	   are	   aggregates	   computed	   using	   CE

Appendix	  B:	  The	  Relationship	  Between	  House	  Prices	  and	  Sales	  Volume	  
	  
The	  literature	  has	  focused	  largely	  on	  how	  changes	  in	  housing	  wealth	  driven	  by	  price	  
movements	   affects	   consumption.	   The	   home	   purchase	   channel	   we	   describe	   is	  
complementary	  to	  this	  channel	  because	  change	  in	  house	  prices	  are	  highly	  correlated	  with	  
changes	  in	  sales	  volume.	  
Figure	   B.1	   shows	   the	   relationship	   between	   several	   measures	   of	   home	   prices	   and	  
home	  sales	  from	  1968	  to	  2013.	  The	  price	  series,	  which	  include	  the	  National	  Association	  of	  
Realtors	  (NAR)	  median	  sales	  price	  (1968–2013),	  the	  CoreLogic	  national	  house	  price	  index	  
(1976–2013),	   and	   the	   Federal	   Housing	   Finance	   Authority	   all	   transactions	   price	   index	  
(1975–2013),	  are	  all	  aggregated	  to	  quarterly,	  seasonally	  adjusted	  (by	  the	  data	  producer),	  
and	  adjusted	  for	  inflation	  using	  the	  CPI	  and	  normalized	  to	  one	  in	  1990.	  The	  sales	  series	  is	  
the	   NAR	   single-­‐family	   home	   sales	   series	   (1968–2013).	   We	   use	   only	   single-­‐family	   sales	  
rather	  than	  all	  sales	  because	  single-­‐family	  sales	  are	  available	  for	  a	  much	  longer	  panel	  than	  
all	  sales.	  To	  minimize	  seasonality	  in	  this	  series,	  which	  is	  not	  seasonally	  adjusted	  by	  the	  data	  
provider,	  we	  show	  a	  one-­‐year	  average	  around	  the	  plotted	  date.	  Panel	  A	  of	  Figure	  B.1	  shows	  
the	  series	  in	  levels,	  while	  panel	  B	  shows	  the	  series	  in	  annual	  log	  changes.	  
The	   price	   series	   are	   highly	   correlated	   with	   the	   sales	   volume	   series,	   although	   sales	  
volume	  is	  somewhat	  more	  volatile.	  Indeed,	  the	  correlation	  of	  the	  price	  series	  with	  the	  sales	  
series	  ranges	  between	  0.75	  and	  0.86,	  depending	  on	  the	  index.	  Beyond	  this	  correlation,	  the	  
figure	   reveals	   that	   in	   both	   the	   early	   1980s	   and	   the	   late	   1980s,	   when	   nationwide	   house	  
prices	  fell	  modestly,	  and	  in	  the	  Great	  Recession,	  sales	  volume	  fell	  much	  more	  than	  prices.	  
Sales	   volume	   appears	   to	   lead	   price	   changes,	   but	   only	   by	   a	   few	   quarters.	   In	   log	   changes,	  
there	  is	  still	  a	  fairly	  strong	  correlation	  between	  sales	  and	  prices,	  although	  sales	  volume	  is	  

	  

59	  

far	   more	   volatile.	   Nonetheless,	   in	   annual	   log	   changes,	   the	   correlations	   between	   the	   sales	  
series	   and	   prices	   are	   0.47	   for	   the	   NAR	   median	   price	   series.	   0.39	   for	   the	   CoreLogic	   Price	  
Index,	  and	  0.43	  for	  the	  FHFA	  price	  index.
