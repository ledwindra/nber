Taxation and the Size and
Composition of the Capital
Stock: An Asset Price pproach

ABSTRACT

This

paper develops an asset price approach to the analysis

of capital taxation. The costs of adjusting capital stocks cause
tax changes to have important impacts on the valuation of existing

capital. The recapitalizations associated with tax reforms
represent an important aspect of their incidence. These effects
are studied within the context of an empirically calibrated

general equilibrium model. The model extends previous work by
explicitly treating the process of adjustment following tax reforms, treating in detail the relationship between tax rules and
interest rates and examining the differential incidence effects
of corporate tax reductions and investment incentives.

The importance of taxation in determining the size and corn-

position of the nation's capital stock is by now widely recog-

nized. Taxes affect both individuals' incentivto save, and

the

allocation of savings among alternative forms of investment.

These effects have been extensively studied within the context
of general equilibrium models of the type developed by Harberger
(1962), and elaborated in the work of Shoven and others.'
These models have been used to estimate the welfare loss
which arises from tax wedges which causes the pre-tax marginal

product of capital in different sectors to diverge, and to analyze
the

long run effects

of tax reforms on real wages and rates of

to

ouiy to changes in tax policy. They assume that there are no
costs of adjustment impeding the accumulation or reallocation of
capital. As a consequence, sectoral marginal products of capital
are always equated. This means that there is essentially rio

scope for variation in the asset price of existing capital goods.
Studies of tax incidence within this framework focus on the
effects of tax changes on the after tax rate of return, because
the constancy of the relative price of capital goods precludes

The implausibility of these assumptions may be seen by noting

that they imply that corporate shareowners would not gain
relative to homeowners from increases in the tax burdens on residential capital and reductions in the tax burdens on corporate

capital. More generally, standard general equilibrium models
have the counterfactual implication that all owners of capital
should have the same preferences about tax policy, since all capi-

tal will be equally affected. Capitalists would. have no reason

to systematically oppose taxes on their own industry. This is
because the standard approach to tax incidence ignores an important
aspect of the actual economy's response to such a tax change.

Return to the example of a reduction in corporate taxes. In the
short run, the price of existing corporate capital would rise, and
of existing homes would fall, as investors reallocated their port-

folios. The price changes would capitalize the expected present
value of the effects of the tax reform on future returns, conferritg windfall gains on the owners of corporate capital, and losses

on homeowners. These price changes would act as signals to the
suppliers of new capital, calling forth more plant and equipment
and fewer homes, until their relative prices were again equated
to their relative long run marginal costs of production.

The extreme volatility of asset prices in the American economy
suggests that these "capitalization" effects are of substantial

importance. The ratio of the market value of corporate capital
to its replacement cost has varied by a factor of more than two

over the last 15 years. The relative price of the stock of owner
occupied housing has increased very substantially. Bulow and
Summers (1984) point to evidence of substantial volatility in the

—3-.

prices of specific used capital goods. Even more extreme vola—
tility has been observed in the relative price of non-reproducible

assets such as land, gold, and Rembrandts. Such relative price
changes represent important transfers of wealth, and must be
considered if the incidence of tax changes is to be accurately
assessed.

A second type of example suggests the importance of focusing

on asset prices in examining tax incidence. Investment can be
stimulated by reducing the corporate tax rate or by the use of
incentives for new investment such as the investment tax credit

or accelerated depreciation. In the long run, these two types
may be designed to have very similar effects. But their incidence
will differ dramatically. Because the former policy benefits old
as well as new capital, it will confer a windfall gain on the owners

of capital at the time that reform is announced. On the other
hand, investment incentives may actually confer a windfall loss
on the holders of existing capital. This di-stinction cannot be
captured within the standard general equilibrium model, but requires a framework in which the distinction between new and old
capital is a meaningful one.

This paper develops a general equilibrium model in which
costs of adjustment are incorporated, so that it is possible to
examine jointly the short run effects of tax policy on asset prices
and the long run effect on patterns of capital accumulation.
The model is intended to provide a realistic guide to the likely
responses of the American economy to tax reforms and so it is
calibrated to econometric estimates of the relevant parameters

—4—

and to data from the National Income Accounts. The model is
solved using the method of multiple shooting developed in Lipton,
Poterba, Sachs and Summers (1982)

While the model is somewhat stylized in that it incorporates

only three types of capital: corporate plant and equipment, owner—
occupied housing and land, it is capable of examining the wealth

effects of tax reforms on economic behavior. Consider for example, the effects of compensated reductions in the corporate tax

rate. This reform is normally analyzed in terms of its effects
on firms' investment incentives. But it has another potentially
large effect. Such a tax reform will raise stock market values
instantaneously as investors capitalize subsequent tax savings.

The resulting increase in wealth will increase consumption tending
to increase required rates of return on all assets.

The advantages of the asset price approach to the evaluation
of tax reforms taken here are discussed in detail in Summers (1984)

The only parameters in the model that are estimated statistically
pertain to tastes or technology and so can be assumed to be in-

variant to the choice of policy rule. Thus the estimates presented here are from the Lucas critique of econometric policy evalua-

tion exercises. Because of its forward looking character, the
model developed here can easily be used to examine the effects
of policy announcements and the differential impacts of temporary
and permanent tax reforms.

The model developed in the paper is used to examine the
effects of indexing the tax system and of various types of tax

reform. The effects of inflation working through the tax system

—5—

have been extensively studied. Typically, researchers have closed
their models by making an arbitrary assumption about the response

of interest rates to inflation. The general equilibrium character of the model developed here makes it possible to endogenously

derive the response of inflation to interest rates. Changes in
depreciation provisions continue to be a major issue in U.S.

tax reform debates. The model presented here can be used to trace
the effects of policies which benefit new but riot old capital
investments.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes
a simple model illustrating the asset price approach to the analysis

of investment incentives and lays out the general structure of

the model used in this paper. In the second section, the corporate
sector of the model is described. The markets for housing and
land, along with the consumption function are discussed in the

third section. The fourth section considers the long run steady

state effects of changes in inflation and in tax policy. The
effects of inflation and tax reforms on asset prices and on short

run economic performance are taken up in the fifth section. A
final section concludes the paper by discussing the implications
of the analysis for current tax policy debates.

Note that the system displays saddle point stability. Except
along a unique path marked by the dark arrows, the system
will not converge. Only along this path does the supply of investment exactly validate the future returns capitalized into
the market price of capital goods. Such saddle point stability

is characteristic of asset price models. It implies that at
any point in time, the stock of capital and assumption of saddle
point stabiliy uniquely determine the

This result may at first seem counter—intuitive. It occurs
because the subsidy reduces the price of new capital which is a
substitute for existing capital. The adverse effect of a reduction

in new car prices on used car prices illustrates the effect

considered here.

Note that effects of tax policy in this model depends only
on the production function and the supply curve for capital goods.

These parameters are technological, and so their estimation is not

dependent on the assumption of a stable policy regime. This is
not the case for standard approaches based on estimated investment
equations. The asset—price approach can also be used to examine
the effects of policy announcements, and the differential effects
of permanent and temporary policies.

The General Equilibrium Model
This paper constructs a general equilibrium perfect foresight growth model in which asset market prices and investment
decisions are determined in a manner parallel to that illustrated

here. There are two important advantages of this approach over
standard general equilibrium models which assume perfect capital
mobility.

First, models which recognize that stocks of capital adjust
slowly are likely to provide much more realistic estimates of the
consequences of tax measures over the policy relevant horizon.

A second virtue of this approach is that it provides a more satis-

factory approach to the analysis of tax incidence. Without introducing adjustment costs of some type it is not possible to account
for the variations in the price of existing assets relative to
replacement costs, which account for most of variation in the return received by asset holders.

Note also that because it provides a basis for evaluating the
windfall gains and losses from tax return, the model here can be

used to address questions of horizontal equity. The importance
of the announcement effects of tax policies on asset values from
the perspective of equity is stressed in Féldstein (1976)

,

who

stresses the desirability of reforms which do not confer windfalls.

The present model provides a basis for considering policies
directed at this objective.

Taking account of adjustment costs entails other sacrifices.
It is not computationally feasible to solve multi—sector models

with more than a very small number of capital goods. This means
that the model must be much more aggregative than many of those

—13—

surveyed in Shoven and Whalley (1984) .

As in general equilibrium models,

there is no explicit treatment of uncertainty, or effort to model

the effects of taxation on corporate financial policy. Considerable
attention is however devoted to modelling the effects of the nonindexation of the tax system.

The modelling of each sector is treated in subsequent sections.

Here the general structure of the model is described. It is
'assumed that physical output is homogenous and is produced according

to an aggregate production function F(K,L) + FTT where T is the
economy's land endowment, and FT are the rents generated on land.
The assumption that land enters th' prcducticn function in an
additively separable way is maintained only for convenience and

does not affect the qualitative results. Output takes two forms:
the basic good Y. which is consumed and used as physical capital

and H, housing capital which produces housing services. The
composition of output depends on the relative price B of housing
in terms of X. The production function may ttius be written:

(3)

G(X,IH) =

F(K,L) +FTT =

Y

where IH represents the production of housing capital. Producers
maximize profits by setting:

(4,

GIH —
Gx

H

This generates an upward sloping supply schedule of housing capital.

S

—14—

There are three physical assets in the model: capital K,

houses H, and land T. The last is inelastically supplied. The
supply of the housing depends on its relative price as shown in

(4). Investment in plant and equipment K is assumed to incur
adjustment costs, so that it depends on Tobin's q ratio of the

market value of capital to its replacement cost. This ratio is
adjusted for the effects of taxes on the cost of acquiring new
capital goods. This is described in more detail in the next
section.

The simplest possible model of portfolio equilibrium is assumed.
The three forrris of physical capital are treated as perfect

substitutes up to risk premiums which cause their after tax returns

to differ by fixed amounts. However, the value of the rental
services provided by tho housing stock is assumed to be a

decreasing function of the quantity of housing capital. Bonds
are also treated as perfect substitutes for capital. Money does
not explicitly enter the model. Implicitly, it is assumed to be
demanded inelastically. Exogenous changes in the rate of inflation
should be thought of as coming from movements in the rate of money
growth.

The Corporate Sector
In

the model

all physical output is assumed to be pro-

in the corporate sector. As already noted, it is assumed
investment in the corporate sector involves internal adjust-

duced

that

ment costs. The determinants of corporate investment and the
market valuation of the corporate sector are modelled using the
approach developed in Summers (1981).

The model is based on q theory of investment linking the
level of investment to the q ratio of the market value of the
corporate capital stock to its replacement cost. The essential
insight underlying Tobin's theory is that in a taxless world
firms invest as long as each dollar spent purchasing capital
raises the market value of the firm by more than one dollar.
Tobin assumes that to a good approximation, the market value
of an additional unit of capital equals the average market value

of the existing capital stock-—that is, average q, measured
as the ratio of the market value of the capital stock to its
replacement cost, is a good proxy for the valne of the marginal

q as an additional dollar of investment. It is natural then
to assume that the rate of investment is an increasing function

of q.
I draw on earlier work by others, especially Hayashi (1982)
to show that under certain

circumstances there is an exact corres-

pondence between average g as measured in the conventional way,
and the shadow price of capital, or "marginal q" associated
with dynamic optimization of a firm's

value

adjustment costs. This correspondence can be used as a basis
for econometric estimation of the adjustment cost function.
I begin by examining how individuals value corporate stock

and then turn to the decision problem facing a firm. Throughout
it is assumed that firms neither issue new equity nor repurchase

existing shares.2 Hence share prices are proportional to the
outstanding value of a firm's equity. The required return, p,
is the sum of capital gains and dividends net of tax. It follows
that

the effects of dividend taxation developed by Auerbach (1979).
It is adopted for the sake of comparability with my earlier
work. Poterba and Summers (1984) provide some evidence in
favor of the alternative "q=l" model of the effects of dividend
taxation.

with the requirement that capital is hozxx)geneous, are essential

investment incentives that is discussed below.

A crucial feature cf the model

is that there is a cost to

changing the capital stock. Without this cost, the size of the
firm would be indeterminate because of the constant returns to
scale and the assumption of perfect competition. The cost of

installing additional capital rises with the rate of capital accumulation, thereby preventing jumps in the demand for capital. The
cost function is taken to be convex and linearly homogeneous in
investment and capital. Under these conditions, dividends can

The first-order condition, equation (9a), implies that labor
is hired until its marginal product and wage are equal. Equation
(9b) characterizes the investment function; it implictly defines
a function linking investment to the real shadow price of capital,
A/p, the tax parameters, and the costs of adjustment. This equation has an intuitive explanation. The right-hand side is the
shadow price of additional capital goods, which is equal to their
marginal cost in after—tax corporate dollars on the left—hand side.
The third first-order condition, (9c) describes the volution
of the shadow price, A. It guarantees that the shadow price equals
the present value of the future marginal produjcts of a unit of
capital. In this model, capital investment is productive in terms
of output and, because of the form of the adjustment—cost function,
in reducing the cost of subsequent investment.
Equation (7b) is of no operational significance as a theory
of investment unless an observable counterpart to the shadow price,
Alp, can be obtained. HayashJ. has shown in a similar model with
a less elaborate tax system how the shadow price is linked to the
market valuation of existing capital.
This link can be demonstrated as follows. Note that VtBt

The remaining assumptions about the corporate sector are

consistent with the constancy of factor shares despite the

changing ratio of capital to output. The share of capital in
the production function is taken to be 0.25. This is quite close
to the observed value in the nonfinancial corporate sector.

depreciation for tax purposes on the capital stock. One additional
complication is introduced in the simulations: firms are assumed

to pay corporate income taxes on FIFO inventory profits. The
magnitude of this tax as a fraction of output is estimated as

the product of thecorporate tax rate and the ratio of the
inventory valuation adjustment of the nonfinancial corporate sector

to its gross output. From this procedure one can conclude that
each point of inflation raises corporate taxes by 0.17 percent
of output.

Note that in this model the deductibility of nominal interest
payments is not the source of the tax advantage enjoyed by owner

occupied housing. Individuals can borrow to finance purchases
of any asset so interest deductibility does not uniquely bene-

fit housing. Rather the source of the tax advantage to housing

in this model is the fact that imputed rents escape taxation.
This distinction is stressed in Summers (1981).

—29—

The supply of housing is determined by profit maximization

as in Equation (4). Increases in its relative price P increase
supply. Poterba (1984) estimates that price elasticity of the
production

of new owner occupied housing is 2.0. This estimate

is used here as a basis for calibrating the function G in uatiai
(3).

I assume this function takes the form.

because they reduce the present value of future labor earnings.
These effects play an important role in the consumption function
postulated here. It is assumed that consumption C is proportional to full wealth, which equals the sum of the present value
of future labor incomes and the market value of existing corporate capital, housing and land. That is:

long run supply of funds to the corporate sector appears
to be very elastic relative to the MPIR schedule so that its
movement with inflation determines the equilibrium relation

An important implication of this analysis is that analyses

of the effects of inflation and taxes which assume
likely to be misleading. The standard argument that corporations
benefit from the deductibility of nominal rather than real
interest payments depends on the ad—hoc assumption that nominal

interest rates only adjust to inflation to

a

limited extent.

The conclusion here should not be surprising. The gain corporations

realize from the deductibility of nominal interest payments

largely offset by the loss their debtho].ders incur. Inflation subsidizes corporate investment only to the extent that t>e

with respect to the real rate of return in the model. This high
elasticity causes the ratio of wealth—to—labor income to decline
with increases in the rate of inflation, if real after tax interest

rates decline at all. If a savings function were postulated that
did not have this property, it would be necessary for the change
in the market value of stocks of housing and land to equal the

change in the stock market. In this greater changes in the rate
of return on housing and land prices would be observed. A savings
function with a lower interest elasticity could be introduced
into the model by assuming that some consumers were liquidity

constrained, or by assuming a lower elasticity of substitution
between present and future consumption.

The steady state effects of various statutory tax reforms are

considered in Table 3. The first column considers an acceleration of tax depreciation roughly comparable to the American ACRS

program as enacted in 1981. The rate of tax depreciation is
assumed to rise from 17 percent a year to 33 percent a year.

This probably understates the actual acceleration of depreciation
because most investment may be treated as equipment for tax
purposes, and because double declining balance depreciation is
permitted.

As one would expect the results suggest that accelerating

depreciation allowances would significantly increase long run

capitalintensity. The predicted increase of 12.4 percent is
sufficient to raise steady state GNP by 3.1 percent and real

wages by 2.5 percent. The fact that the real after tax rate of

rises by only 10 basis points in equilibrium means that
a substantial fraction of the long run benefit from accelerated
depreciation falls on workers rather than the owners of capital.

interest rates, there is again some crowding out

The

the

second column considers the effects of eliminating

corporate income tax. This is predicted to have only a

slightly greater impact on long run capital intensity than

acceleration of depreciation. However its other effects
are quite different. Where accelerating depreciation reduces
the effective purchase price of new capital goods, elimination
of corporate iricon taxes raises the effective purchase price
because of the expensing of adjustment costs and the presence
of accelerated depreciation. For this reason, the ratio of the

This increase also reflects the fact that the elimination of
the corporate tax applies to the return on old as well as new
capital.
The substantial increase in wealth caused by the change in
the value of the market relative to the corporate capital stock
raises consumption,

thus bidding up interest rates. While elim-

of the corporate income tax spurs only slightly more
corporate investment than acceleration of depreciation, it crowds

reduces

prices by 7.4 percent. The effects on market value shown

here reveal that the long run

incidence

of eliminating the corp-

orate income tax is very different than that of accelerating
depreciation allowances.

The third column of the table examines the effects of elim-

inating capital gains taxation. Recall that in the model only

corporate capital is subject to capital gains taxation. This
reform has a significant effect on capital formation despite its
xelatjvely small impact on the

stock market.

The reason for

this involves the assumption that all equity investment is

financed from retentions rather than new equity issues. Reductions in the capital gains tax raise the effective price of new

capital

goods, because they increase the tax

penalty

to paying

dividends. Because this type of return has only small wealth
effects, it has only a negligible impact on the prices of housing and

land.

—42—

The dividend tax reduction

considered

in the fourth Section

has what may seem to be a paradoxical effect. It actually reduces the long run capital stock by about 1.5 percent. This

arises because of the assumption that equity investment
is financed out of retained earnings. Reductions in dividend
taxes raise the cost of capital by an amount just sufficient to
offset the increased return to shareholders. Thus they are
peutral with respect to new investment. The reduction in diviresult

dend taxes does however have a wealth effect, as it raises the

equilibrium value of stock market. This increases consumption
raising demand and the interst rate, in turn reducing capital

intensity. The increased interest rate slightly reduces the
price of land and houses.

There is obviously an important moral for policy here.
Insofar as marginal investment is financed out of retentions,
reductions

in tax rates on high bracket

individuals are likely

to confer windfalls without spurring significant amounts of new

investment. This conclusion is supported by the simulation in
the fifth

column of

the effects of eliminating the interest

income tax. This encourages corporate investments slightly
and discourages investment in housing and land. The result
occurs because corporations deduct interest payments at the
46 percent rate while households deduct them at a lesser rate.
If interest rates adjusted to the change in 8 by only enough

—43—

to keep the real after tax individual return on bonds constant,
corporations would gain because of their reduced borrowing
costs, and no one else would lose——so the income expenditure iden-

tity would not be satisfied. Hence the real return rises slightly
but not enough to offset all the stimulus to corporate investment.
Steady state calculations of the type reported here are only

approximate guides in analyzing tax policy. The next section
considers the transition path of the economy following several

tax reforms.. Particular attention is devoted to the
effects arising from asset revaluations following tax

An interesting feature of the results is the behavior of

interest rates. Following the indexation of the tax system, the
real after tax short term interest rate rises. This occurs because the

liabilities. In the short run, output is fixed and so real
interest rates are bid up. In the longer run, capital is
accumulated and the rate of interest declines until the real

after tax rate of return returns to its original level. This
path of interest rates implies that there is significant short
run crowding out following indexation, but much less in the
long run.
In Tables 5 and 6, the incidence of eliminating the coinparable tax system and using accelerated depreciation are examined. Both have quite similar long run effects on capital intensity in the corporate sector. However, their incidence effects are
very different. The elimination of the corporate income tax
causes corporate shareholders to receive a windfall excess return
of 76.2 percent when the tax reform is announced. Significant
capital losses are suffered by the owners of houses and land.
On the other hand, the windfall from accelerating depreciation

is a less than 1 percent increase in the value of the stock
market and much smaller reductions in the value of-housing and
land.
The differences point up the importance of taking an
asset price approach to the analysis of tax incidence. Traditional approaches would convert an acceleration of depreciation
allowances into a reduction in the effective tax rate, and then
focus on differences in the steady state rate of return to cap-

ital. They would reveal only very

is their differential effect on the value of used capital as
explained in the preceding section. !Jote that the analysis
here suggests that there is nothing paradoxical thout the failure
of the ,tock market to respond strongly to the recently enacted

of tax

relief.

These results show that corporate tax changes have important
effects

on interest rates. The pattern of response is similar

in both simulations. Following expansionary policy, the interest
rate rises and then returns toward its equilibrium level as cap-

ital is accumulated. In the case of corporate tax

A surprising

feature

of all the simulations is the relative

unimportance of induced changes in land and housing prices,

arising from inflation or changes in tax policy. The cause is
the insencitivity of interest rate to tax changes. This in turn
is a consequence of the form of the consumption function which

makes savings highly interest elastic. If savings were more

VI. Conclusions
The simulations of the model may shed some light on recent

economic experience. The model predicts the observed negative
relationship between changes in stock market values and the rate
of inflation, as well as the positive relationship between infla-

tion and housing and land prices. These predictions based on tax
effects, first made in the late 1970's, have stood up very well

during the disinflation of early 1980's. Real stock prices have
risen .dramatically whereas real housing prices have actually declined.

The composition of capital investment between residential and nonresidential investment has also fluctuated as predicted by the
model presented here.

interpreted as a descriptive
theory of stock market prices, other asset prices or investment.
It is clear that forces other than changes in the tax law account
for most of the variations in these variables. Tax factors may
help to explain their movements, but they are only a small part
of the story. In analogy to a regression equation, their coefIn no sense can this model be

large and significant but the R2 is very low. The

model does reveal one very striking anomaly——the behavior of

interest rates in the face of rising inflation. The model yields
the conclusion that inflation should raise interest rates by far

more than point for point. The calculations indicate that each
extra percentage point of inflation should raise nominal interest

rates by close to 150 basis points. This is a prediction about

—52--

the effects of long run changes in the underlying inflation
rate, caused by changes in the rate of money growth, not high
frequency movements in inflation. In Summers (1983), I show

that this prediction is not borne out.
This anomaly raises important doubts about analysis of the

effects of inflation and its interactions with the tax system.
In what sense can this model be interpreted as demonstrating

that the interaction of inflation and taxes partially explains
the downturn in the stock market and the level of investment
during the 1970's. The negative relationship between inflation
and these variables in the model is predicated on an assumed

increase in interest rates. If behavior more like the actual
reality is inserted into the model, and interest rates are assumed
to rise point for point with inflation, the implication would
be

an increase in the stock market and investment. This is the

essential point, of the analyses

of Gordon (1980) and Bendershott

(1980).

There iS clearly more than one way to look at the question.
I believe that a general equilibrium model of the type used here
is the "right" way to examine inflation—taxation interactions.
It provides a way of examining the "pure" effects of changes in
the rate of inflation unaccompanied by other real shocks.
The failure of interest rates to rise more fully with inflation
presumably reflects either some form of inflation illusion or
a historical correlation between rates of inflation and

real

shocks. In neither case would it be appropriate to ignore the.

of asset prices or investment. The usual procedure of estiinating or postulating an inflation-interest rate relationship and
then using it as a basis for analyzing tax effects involves an

hybrid of theory and evidence. If the goal is to examine
effects only, a general equilibrium model of the type used

here is appropriate. If the objective is describing the actual
behavior of the economy, it is necessary to model the full effects

results here have implications for the analysis of stat—
ury tax reform. Perhaps most importantly, they illustrate the

recognizing adjustment costs. The half—life of

the capital stock following shocks is over a
decade in the simulations reported here. Because of these substantial lags in the adjustment of the capital stock, tax reforms
have important wealth effects. They confer large windfalls on
the owners of different types of capital assets. For example,
the simulations suggest that eliminating the corporate income
tax would confer a windfall excess return of over 70 percent on
the owners of corporate stock. Measures which benefit only new
capital such as the investment tax credit are likely to involve
much smaller windfalls.
The finding that adjustment costs are large enough to

explaining why q is not maintained at a more constant level by the
elastici supply of new capital goods. An Lmportant priority for future
research must be determining the nature of the adjustment costs which
lead to the sluggish response of investment to tax changes.

A second major conclusion which comes from the analysis is
the sensitivity of the supply of funds

to

the corporate sector

to the rate of return. Because of the high elasticity of overafl savings with respect to the rate of return, and the reallocation of investors' portfolios, changes in business taxation

have only very small effects on interest rates. Eliminating the
corporate income tax for example, which would raise the after
tax marginal product of corporate capital by about 5 percent in
the short run, is estimated to increase interest rates by 1.1

in the short run and only .5 points in the long run. This
finding is consistent with the empirical evidence in Feldstein
