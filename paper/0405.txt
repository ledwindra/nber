Inequality Within and

Between Families

ABSTRACT

Between—family differences in expenditures arid

output

reflect

the effect of simultaneous increases in children's ability on the

willingness of parents to transfer resources to them. Within—family
differences also reflect the attitudes of parents toward disparity among
children. In this paper we characterize the conditions on parents'
preferences that determine whether between—family differences exceed

within—family differences. For an additive utility, within—family
differences in expenditures always exceed between—family differences.

This may also be true for the max—mm utility function if an increase
in ability reduces the marginal utility of income. Within—family
differences in output (utility or income) can also exceed between—family

differences. In this case, the implication for income distribution is
that equality is enhanced by a higher correlation of ability between
brothers.

INEQUALITY WITHIN AND BETWEEN FM4ILIES1

by
Eytan Sheshinski* and Yoram Weiss**

Introduction

1.

A major goal of government policy is to affect the income distribution

between individuals in society. There are, however, other social institutions which affect the income distribution and their actions may either

reinforce or countervail those of the government. The family plays a major
role in this respect. The effect of the family on the distribution of
income depends on the variation in individual characteristics within and

between families and on the rules for allocation of family resources. We
are interested in a particular aspect of this problem: the allocation of
parental resources among children of different abilities and its effect on
the distribution of their future income and welfare.
The nature of the problem can be illustrated by means of a very simple

example. Consider two families, each consisting of two children. Let the
parents of each family have the same wealth. Children are distinguished
solely by their endowed ability. Suppose that half the children's population is of 'high ability' and half of 'low ability.' One possibility is
that all differences in ability are within families and hence each family

has one 'able' and one 'less able' child. Another possibility is that
differences are only between families where one family has two 'able'

children and the other has two 'less able' children. We would like to
compare the distribution of inputs, e.g., schooling expenditures, and the

distribution of outputs, that is, income and utility, in the above two
cases.

As noted by Griliches [1978], the relevant question for this comparison
is whether a given difference in ability leads to a larger difference in

expenditures or income within families than across families. This issue
is quite separate from the one analyzed by Becker and Tomes [1976] who
inquired whether parents invest more resources in the relatively able child.
This latter question is relevant for the comparison of the family's optimal
redistributive policy to the hypothetical policy of no intervention.
The purpose of this paper is to characterize the properties of parental
preferences that are relevant for the comparison of within— and between—

family differences. We limit our discussion to parents' utility functions

which are symmetric in children's utility. It is assumed that utilities
are comparable within the family. Much of our discussion will focus on
two special cases that have received attention in the social choice

literature: the additive (utilitarian) and the max—mm (utility equalization) functions. Both rules can be justified as egalitarian. The max—mm
principle is egalitarian ex post, while the utilitarian principle is
egalitarian ex ante, equalizing the expected utility of each (unborn)

child (see Harsanyi [1975], Myerson [1979] and Appendix). We assume that
the utility of each child depends on the transfers he receives from his

parents and on his ability. This has to be interpreted as the indirect
utility function in which all future individual actions have been
'maximized out.'

Much of the analysis hinges upon the interaction between children's
abilities and parents' expenditures in the indirect utility function.
This, in turn, depends on the feasible methods of transferring resources

3

within the family. If parents can make positive and negative direct
transfers that are not conditional on schooling and if ability affects
utility only through the production of earnings, then it is possible to
separate efficiency from distributive considerations (see Becker and

Tomes [1976)). In this case, the differences in schooling expenditures
within and between families are identical. In our analysis we assume that
such separation is not feasible, either due to the fact that ability may
affect utility directly or due to limits on parents' power to enforce

negative transfers on their grown—up children. In this sense our analysis
is similar to Arrow [1971] and Behrman, Pollack and Taubman [1979] who,
however, did not compare within— and between—family differences.
Between—family differences in expenditures and outputs reflect the
effect of simultaneous increases in children's ability on the willingness

of parents to transfer resources to them. Within—family differences also
reflect the attitudes of parents towards disparity among children. In this
paper we characterize the conditions on parents' preferences that determine

whether between—family differences exceed within—family differences. For
an additive utility, within—family differences in expenditures always

exceed between—family differences. This may also be true for the max—mm
utility function if an increase in ability reduces the marginal utility of

income. Within—family differences in output (utility or income) can also
exceed between—family differences. In this case, the implication for
income distribution is that equality is enhanced by a higher correlation
of ability between brothers.

Analysis of Family Allocation Rules

Consider a family consisting of parents and two children. Denote
the consumption of parents by c and the expenditures on each child by

and s2, respectively. The indirect utility function of each child,
written u1= u(s.,a.), i =

and

1,2,

u,

is

where a. is an index of child i's ability

0. Parents seek

0,

s1

to rnaxfrize

a utility function,

V., which depends on their own consumption and on the utility levels of their
children,

V =

(1)

V(c,u(s1,a1),u(s2,a2)),

where V is assumed to be strictly monotone, quasi—concave and symmetric in
the last two arguments, i.e.,

(2)

V(c,x1,x2) =

V c,x1,x2 >

V(c,x2,x1)

0.

The family's budget constraint is given simply by

c + s + S2 = in

(3)

where m is the family's wealth, to beallocated by the parents.1
Naximization of (1) subject to (3) yields solutions

and (a1,a2). Wealth will be assumed constant throughout most
of the discussion and hence the dependence on in

is

suppressed. It is also

assumed that these solutions are strictly positive. Our discussion focuses
on the following properties of these solutions:

iii

(1) Input and Output Progressivity (Arrow [1971]). The dependence of

.1

and

ii

=

u(s.(a

,a.) on a., I =

1,2;

that is, whether

the

otimir.

levels of expenditures. and utility increase or decrease with own ability;

5

(2) Within—Family Differences in Inputs and Outputs (Becker and

Tomes [1976]). For a1 >

and similarly
a2, whether 1(a1,a2) -- 2(a1,a2)

for utility levels, i1(a1,a2) - c12(a1,a2); that is, whether heterogeneous
families whose children have different abilities reinforce or compensate
for these ability differences;

(3) Between—Family Differences in Inputs and Outputs. For a1 > a2,
whether 1(a1,a1) --

2(a2,a)

and Ci1(a1,a1) --

ci2(a2,a2); that is,whether

expenditures and utility increase or decrease with ability across homogeneous
families whose children's abilities are perfectly correlated.

(4) Comparison of Within— and Between—Family Differences in Inputs and

Outputs (Griliches [1978]). For any pair (a1,a2), whether 1(a1,a2) —

is

larger or smaller than I1(a1,a1) —

whether i11(a1,a2) —

that

i2(a1,a2)I

2(a2,a2)l.

Similarly,

is larger or smaller than ci1(a1,a1) —

is, for given ability differences, whether differences

within heterogeneous families are larger or smaller than differences across
homogeneous families.
For purposes of exposition we start with a simplified version of the

above problem which brings out its essential features. Suppose that
ability affects utility only through its effect on earnings capacity and
that the production function is multiplicative, i.e., u. =

f(a.s.),

i =

1,2.

u(sa.)

Utility is thus identified with (observable) income

and, without loss of generality, we can assume that f(a.s.) =

a.s,.

The problem can now be reduced to a standard consumer model:

(4)

Max

V(c,u1,u2)

c ,u1 ,u2

s.t. c + p1u1 + p2u2

m

6

where p. =

-i--, i

= 1,2.

With this formulation, the dependence of inputs

on own ability is determined by whether demand elasticity is less than or

s.
larger than unity in absolute value:

=

—p

i=

,

1,2.

The

dependence of outputs (i.e., utilities) on own ability is determined by
the slope of the uncompensated demand functions:

--—

.

Starting

from a state of equality, there are two opposing forces at work. An
increase in ability of one child increases his efficiency in producing

earnings. On the other hand, since his utility is higher, it reduces
the relative weight given to him in the parents' utility. The outcome
is therefore ambiguous (see Becker and Tomes [1976]). In contrast, there
is no ambiguity with respect to within—family differences in utility.

7

Proposition 1.

Proof. Let a1 >

< U2 as

a2.

a2, i.e., p1 < p2, and suppose that ia1(a1,a2) <

Then p1i1 + p22 >

V(c,1a2,ii1),

a1

p12

+ p2i11. However, by symmetry, V(c,ia1,i2) =

for any c. By strict quasi—concavity, there exists therefore

a feasible allocation that yields a higher V. Hence, (c11,C12) cannot be

optimal J.

In

families with identical children p1 =

p2

and we can define a

composite good p(u1+u2), where p is some base level of ability.
Between—family differences in expenditures depend on the uncompensated
cross elasticity of parents' consumption with respect to this composite
good.

Proposition 2.

If

is a gross—substitute (complement) to u1+u2 then,

among homogeneous families, expenditures increase (decrease) with the
children' s ability.

Proof. Since V is symmetric in u1 and u2, 1(a,a) =

-[m—c(a,afl, for any a. Thus,

d1(a,a)
da

2(a,a)

d2(a,a) =
da

2

=

d(a,a)
da

Increased ability of children has two opposing effects on parents'

consumption:. an income effect which is likely to induce higher consumption
by parents and a substitution effect which encourages an increase in
expenditures on children and a reduction in parents' consumption.
We are now ready to compare within— and between—family differences in
inputs and outputs.

8

Proposition 3. If ,

and 2 are all either gross—substitutes or gross—

i:i1

complements, thenwithin—family differences exceed between—family differences

in expenditures. Specifically, for a1 >

1(a1,a1)

(a2,a)

When the goods are gross—substitutes, all inequalities are reversed in the

case of gross—complements.

Proof. The middle inequality follows from Proposition 2. The other two

inequalities

Ct1(a1,a1).

But i1(a1,a2) =

Proposition 4. If ,

implies that when a1 >

a11(a1,a2)

(a,a)

a2,

for a1 >

(6)

a1(a1,a2) >

Proof.

ii(a1,a)

>

ii2(a,a2)

>

The middle inequality follows immediately from Proposition 3 since

the allocation of expenditures within the family reinforces ability

differences. The other inequalities follow directly from the assumption .

Contrary

to the previous case, gross—complementarity does not imply

the same result. Indeed, we have the following.

Proposition 5. If

and

are gross—complements, then between—family

differences exceed within—family differences in utility. Specifically,
for a1 >

a2,

9

i1(a1,a1) > ii(1,2) > 2(a,a)

(7)

>

Ci2(a2,a2).

Proof. The middle inequality follows from Proposition 1. The other
inequalities follow directly from the assumptions ll•

The above propositions can be used to determine the implications of
alternative specifications of the family utility function for the allocation
of family resources.

We shall examine these implications for the ex ante (additive utility)

and for the ex post (max—mm) egalitarian criteria.

A. Additive Utility
Let V have the form

(8)

V(c,u(s1,a1)

where

u.1

=

a.s.,
11

,u(s2,a2)) = w(c)

1,2,

I =

+ v(u1) +

v(u2)

and w and v are monotone, strictly concave

functions. In this case, the conditions of Propositions 1—5 depend solely on
the signs of

a

=

v'(u.)

+ u.v"(u.), i =

1,2.

of expenditures increases with ability for both

If the marginal utility

and 2 then

and

will be gross—substitutes. In the opposite case all goods are gross—
complements. Hence, for an additive utility function, within—family
differences always exceed between—family differences in expenditures.
On the other hand, within—family differences exceed or are less than

between—family differences in utility according as the marginal
utility of expenditures increases or decreases with ability.

10

B. Max-mm
Let V have the form

V(c,u(s,a1),u(s2,a2)) = w(c)

(9)

where u. =

a.s,,

1

1,2. Clearly,

+
=

tnin[v(u1),v(u2))
and hence these are gross—

complements. Thus, only Propositions 2, 3 and 5 are potentially applicable.
As in the previous case, it can be shown that &
(and

if and only if v'(u.) + u.v"(u.) <

Is

0,

a gross—complement to
i =

1,2.

In this case the max—mm function too entails that within—family
differences exceed between—family differences in expenditures. Since the
conditions of Proposition 5 hold, between—family differences exceed

within—family differences in utility. In particular, therefore, the
max—mm criterion implies that an able child enjoys a lower utility level
in a heterogeneous family than in a homogeneous family. This may raise a
question with regard to the 'fairness' of the max—mm criterion in the
present context. That is, if children or parents compare utilities across
families, then within—family equalization may be judged unfair towards

the able child. The ex ante egalitarian (sum of utilities) rule bypasses
this difficulty since it accounts for the chance of the able child to be
born into a family with another able child.2
As the above two examples Illustrate, within—family differences may

well exceed between—family differences in expenditures. Variations in
children's ability induces two kinds of transfers from parents to children

and among children. These may reinforce or offset each other. In the
additive case the same cause that leads parents to transfer resources to
the able (or less able) child, namely, his higher marginal utility, also
induces them to transfer resources from his brother if he is of different

11

ability. In the max—mm case parents may also transfer resources to their
less able child if they perceive his marginal utility to be higher. If
children within the family have different abilities, parents will also
transfer resources from the able to the less able, thereby reinforcing

between—family differences. In the opposite case, however, when the
marginal utility of the able child is higher, then in homogeneous families
parents will be willing to transfer resources to them, but in heterogeneous
families parents will tax the able child in favor of the less able.
Between— and within—family differences in expenditures will therefore be
of opposite sign.

Consider now the more general case of nonlinear 'production functions'
u. =

u(s.,a),

i =

1,2.

invert u to obtain s. =
1

Since u

is strictly monotone in s, one can

I =

With this transformation the

maximization problem is

s.t. c+p1u1+p2u2 =

e(u. ,a.)

where p (u.,a1)

j

m

1,2.

Previously we have analyzed the case

in which e. is linear in u. and hence p. is independent of u, giving rise
to a standard consumer problem. In the present case, Propositions 1—5 have
to be reinterpreted as describing outcomes of shifts in the 'supply

functions,' p.(u.,a.), due to changes in a.. For instance,
< 0, i

gross—substitutes when

and 112 are

j. However, such relations now depend

J

jointly on utility, V, and on the'production function,' u.

12

3.

Unobservable Utilities
In the previous section we have assumed that the utility of children

can be directly observed and have placed restrictions on parents'

preferences. When children's utilities are unobservable one cannot
separately identify the functional forms of parents' and children's

utilities. Meaningful restrictions must therefore be in terms of
expenditure allocation patterns. As before, we shall investigate two

cases, the additive and the max—mm utility functions.

A. Additive Utility
Let

(11)

V(c,u(s1,a1),u(s2,a2)) =

w(c)

+ v(s1,a1) + v(s2,a2)

where w and v are strictly concave with respect to c and s.,.

The crucial restriction to this specification is that the marginal
rate of substitution between parents' consumption and expenditures on
child i are independent of the ability of child j, j

i.

A very simple geometrical argument can be used to show that the
results in the previous section pertaining to the additive specification
carry over to the present, more general case. Specifically, within—family
differences always exceed between—family differences in expenditures.
In Figure 1, we depict the solutions for each of the first—order
conditions (F.O.C.) of the problem:

=

(m—s1—s2) + v1(s1,a1) = 0

(m—s1—s2) + v1(s2,a2) = 0

Strict concavity implies that the curves are negatively sloped and inter—

Then the solution corresponding to this variation must be

below the 45° line, that is, at point c, expenditures on the able exceed

those on the less able child. Furthermore, the solution for the case

This chain is reversed when v12(s,a) < 0.

Thus, in this case too, within—

family differences exceed between—family differences.

Let

(13)

V(c,u(s1,a1),u(s2,a2)) =

w(c)

Assuming, as we have throughout, that the solution is strictly
positive, maximization of (13) is equivalent to the maximization of (11)
subject to the constraint

u(s1,a1) —

Wealth Effects
The attitude of families towards inequality among children depends, in

general, on the family's wealth. A natural question is whether inequality
increases or decreases with the level of wealth. This can be easily
analyzed within the framework of Section 2. For the additive case,
attitudes towards inequality in output are summarized by the index —

Although for choices under risk the index of absolute risk—aversion,

generally assumed to be decreasing in u, it is perhaps more

plausible to assume the opposite when the degree of inequality within
families is concerned.

increasing in u, that is, the family prefers higher equality

Under the max—mm criterion full equality in outputs is attained at
all wealth levels. In terms of expenditures, however,

Efficient Allocations
Throughout the discussion we have assumed that parents' transfers to

children interact with ability in the indirect utility function. Typically,
ability interacts with schooling expenditures in the production of earnings.
However, if there are other modes of direct wealth transfers then at the
optimum, unless ability affects utility directly, the level of utility is

independent of ability. Suppose that the production function of earnings,
y, is given by u =

f(s,a).

The indirect utility function, u, is u(x+y),

where x is direct wealth transfers from parents. The family's problem is
restated as

Max

is fully equalized and the allocation
i =

1,2.

satisfies f1(1,a.) = 1,

and

We shall refer to this as the efficient solution. In contrast to

the previous discussion, the allocation of .

to

each child depends only on

his own ability. Thus, between— and within—family differences coincide.

18

The efficient solution will also be attained when schooling decisions
are made outside the family, either by individuals with access to the
capital market or by a planner who can enforce income transfers across
individuals.

In the absence of direct income transfers, the family's allocation of

expenditures will generally not be efficient.3 Distributive considerations
will also play a role since the allocation to each child depends on family

income and on his brother's ability. It is impossible to compare the
second—best allocation to the efficient one. If family's wealth happens
to be at the level that would yield the same total expenditure on children
as in the efficient allocation, then the distribution of expenditure within
the family will be less favorable to the able one than the efficient

allocation.4 At other levels of family income the two allocation rules
are not comparable.

6.

Implications for the Distribution of Income
The implications of our analysis

the distribution of income can be

described simply in the framework of the model presented in Section 2.
Suppose that the earnings function, y, is of the form:

y =

and that the family allocation rule is approximated by:

Suppose that

0.

This corresponds to the case in which the two children can be viewed as

gross—substitutes. In the case of no systematic differences in ability
between families p will be zero, while if p =

1.

all differences in ability

are between families. The implication of Proposition 2 is that income
inequality will be larger in the former case.

The interaction of a positive correlation between children' ability
and negative within—family cross effects reduces the inequality in
earnings relative to the case of random assignments of children to

families. Since within—family differences in income exceed between—
family differences, income equality is enhanced by a more egalitarian

distribution of ability in the family. The converse holds when 2 > 0,
i.e., when children are gross—complements.
In the extreme case of only between—family differences, i.e., p = 1,

the family affects the income distribution only through transfers from

parents to children. If it is assumed that parents' consumption is a
gross—substitute to children's utility (income), i.e.,

>

0,

then

the family can be viewed as contributing to inequality relative to the
case of no intervention, i.e.,

=

2 = 0.

If the correlation between

children's ability is less than unity, then the family will have an
additional effect on inequality due to transfers of earnings capacity

among children. This contribution to income inequality will be positive

if 2 > 0, and negative if 2 < 0.

20

The analysis can be extended to incorporate variations in family

wealth. As explained in Section 4, family wealth is likely to interact
with ability in the family allocation rule. Furthermore, it is probable
that children's ability and parents' income are correlated. In principle,
one can derive from these relations the intergenerational laws of motion
for the income distribution (see Becker and Tomes [19791), but we shall
not pursue this issue here.

Footnotes

1. Future earnings of children are not subject to redistribution and are
reflected in the indirect utility of each child. For a case in which
the allocation scheme also affects the size of wealth to be distributed,
see Green and Sheshinski [1975].
2. One may view such ex ante evaluation as irrelevant, insisting on ex post
fairness and yet be satisfied with a weaker form of within—family
equalization. One plausible rule is to maximize the sum of children's
utilities subject to the constraint that neither receives less than he
would have received if all children had his ability.
3. In some special cases, the efficient solution is attained even in the
absence of direct transfers. In particular, if V1(c,u,u) = V2(c,u,u) =
V3(c,u,u) for any c and u (e.g., V(c,u1,u2) = F(c+u1+u2) +
then in families with identical children the allocation will be efficient.
In this case, between—family differences are identical to the differences
that exist when income transfers are feasible. However, within—family
differences are not efficient.

4. The within—family allocation satisfies

_________ —

V1(u1,u2)
Assume a1 > a2; then due to symmetry and quasi—concavity of V, u1 > u2
and V1(u1,u2) < V2(u1,u2) at the optimum. Thus, the ratio on the R.H.S.
is larger than 1. The efficient allocation satisfies

and Taubman [199] who assume that total expenditures are independent of
children's ability and, accordingly, test for the concavity of V. They
find that parents' utility is concave in children's incomes and that the
allocation of expenditures is therefore inefficient. In general, however,
total expenditures will depend on children's ability, giving rise to
between—family differences.

Appendix

The purpose of this appendix is to prove the equivalence of ex ante
egalitarianism and ex post utilitarianism in the context of redistribution
within the family.

A family consists of parents (viewed as a single unit) and k children,
denoted by i, i =
a =

1,2,•••,k.

(al,a2,...,ak).

Let a. denote the ability of child i and

It is assumed that a is a random vector with proba-

bility distribution F(a). Let s.(a) be the allocation to child i given a,

s(a) =

(sl(a),s2(a),.,sk(a)),

(rn—family income, constant). Let u =

be the utility of child i

k

(/s.)u(s.(a),a,) > 0 and u11 < 0. Let w = W(m —

s.) be
i= 1

the parents' utility, w' > 0, 'hr" < 0.

Consider the following two problems.

in (A.4) and (A.5). Then the solution to (A.6) satisfies

(A.4) and (A.5). We shall show that this solution also satisfies (A.2) and
hence is a solution of Problem A.
Consider a solution to (A.6) associated with a =

and a permutation a' =

(a.,a2,...,al,...,a.K).

Relabeling the solution

correspondingly, the same set of equations is seen to be satisfied. That
is, the following symmetry condition holds:

thus satisfying (A.2).

Remark. The above theorem can be illustrated geometrically for a family

with two children whose respective abilities assume the values (a,a) and

(a,a) with equal probabilities. Due to symmetry, (A.7), the same total

+ s =

will be distributed to the children in both cases. The

efficient utility pairs (u1,u2), given , corresponding to the two realizations are the curves AA and BB in Figure A.1. Pairs that yield equal
expected utilities must be equally distant from the 45° line. The pair
that yields the highest equal levels of expected utilities is such that
the line connecting them is bisected by the 45° line and is tangent to

both utility frontiers. Such a line exists because of symmetry of the
utility frontiers. The implied allocations, a on AA and b on BB, maximize
the sum of utilities for each realization of the ability vector.
