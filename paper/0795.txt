Women, Children, and Industrialization in the Early
Republic: Evidence from the Manufacturing Censuses

ABSTRACT

The first half of the nineteenth century was a critical
juncture regarding the emergence of female participation in
the market economy, the increase in the wage of females
relative to that of adult males, and the evolution of large
scale firms in both mechanized and non-mechanized industries.
We present the first systematic and comprehensive description
of these events as they evolved in the states of the Northeast
to 1850. Our sources are primarily samples taken from three
early censuses and reports of manufacturing, 1820, 1832, and 1850.
Our principal findings are: (1) that women and children
composed a large share (over 40% in 1832) of the entire manufacturing labor force during the initial period of industrialization in the U.S., but that this share began a secular decline
as early as 1840; (2) that the wage of females (and boys) relative to that of adult males rose wherever large scale manufacturing establishments spread and that by 1850 this ratio had
risen
to almost 90% its long-term level; (3) that the labor
force participation of young unmarried women in the industrial
counties of the Northeast was, in 1832, high by late nineteenth
century standards; and (4) that the employment of females and
boys was closely associated with production processes used by
large-scale establishments. Women and children had been a
previously under-utilized and large segment of the potential
labor force, and their harnessing by manufacturing was a
critical factor in the industrialization of the Northeast.

The first objection [the dearness of labor] ceases to be
formidable when it is recollected how prodigiously the proportion of manual labor in a variety of manufactures has been
decreased by the late improvements in the construction and
application of machines -- and when it is also considered to
what extent women and children in the populous parts of the
country may be rendered auxiliary to undertakings of this nature.

Useful Manufactures, undoubtedly drafted by

I

It has long been argued that during the early phase of industrialization in
America,

manufacturers grappled with ways to reduce the cost of labor. An abun-

dance of

agricultural land has been viewed as contributing to the development

of labor-saving and capital-intensive technologies in the U.S., by serving to
establish a high price for unskilled male labor.

It has been less widely acknow-

ledged that American industry also responded to the high relative price of adult males
by adapting its organization of work to utilize alternative sources of labor pro-

vided

by women (generally young and unmarried) and children.

1

Previous studies

have focused on the employment of women and children in the highly mechanized

textile industry. But women and children also constituted substantial proportions
of the labor forces of many other industries which did not experience significant
mechanization prior to 1850.

2

The technologies of these industries were altered

in yet other ways, which produced a more intricate division of labor within the firm,

a more disciplined work regime, and a larger scale of operation. Our central
theme is that the spread of all these technologies greatly facilitated the substitution of unskilled for skilled labor and in particular accounted for the
substantial increase in the employment of women and children, which extended

-2-

across much of the northeastern manufacturing sector. We also explore the impact
of industrialization on the labor force participation rates of females and children
and their wages relative to those of adult men during the first half of the nineteenth century.

We will argue that the employment of women and children evolved rapidly during

the period of industrialization in the two decades prior to 1832. Spurred by the
interruptions

in foreign trade, among other factors, the manufacturing sector

expanded greatly, as did the scale of individual manufacturing enterprises. The
proportion of the northeastern manufacturing labor force composed of females and
males seems likely to have grown from about 10% early in the century to over

young

40% by 1832. This share was maintained for at most a decade, but the relative
growth

of industries

immigrants,

intensive in male labor, competition

from unskilled male

the increase in the relative wage for women and children,

technological

and further

developments each may have contributed to a secular decline in the

proportion of the manufacturing labor force composed of women and children.
It should not be surprising that northern manufacturers were initially quick

to adopt production methods that relied extensively on the employment of women and

children. The low relative productivity of these workers in the North's agricultural sector, where hay, dairy goods, and grains were the major products, had

established a relatively low opportunity cost for their labor. Wherever the
manufacturing sector expanded, the wages of women and children were bid up substan-

tially, both in absolute terms and relative to those of males. During the brief
period from 1820 to 1850 the ratio of the female to the adult male wage in manufacturing rose to almost 90% the value it achieved from 1885 to 1960, when it was

relatively stable. The rise in manufacturing employment of females was also
associated with an equally impressive advance in their rate of labor force partici-

pation. Thus the first half of the nineteenth century was a critical juncture in

-3-

the evolution of both female participation in the market economy and the relative
wage of females in the manufacturing sector. We present the first systematic arid
comprehensive description of these events as they evolved in the states of the
Northeast to 1850.

In a related paper we develop a simple general equilibrium model that con—

nects some of the changes we more thoroughly document in this article.3 While
we will not formally discuss the details of this model, we will make references to
them .

We

have the following sort of model in mind throughout our analysis. Con-

sider the simplest of all variants of a general equilibrium model: a two sector
(agriculture and manufacturing), two input (female plus child labor and male
labor) model, in which agriculture is relatively intensive in male labor at all
factor price ratios, and endowments and output prices are exogenously determined.
Initially, perhaps around 1800 before the growth of manufacturing establishments,

the relative wage for females and children compared to that for adult men was

quite low. Production techniques in the manufacturing sectOr would not yet have
been explored to utilize female (and child) labor, which may differ from male

labor objectively in terms of skill, experience, dexterity, and strength, or
subjectively in terms of cultural norms. During the period, say from 1810 to
1830, the range of production possibilities in the manufacturing sector is increased,
and with it the proportion of females employed in manufacturing, the proportion
of the manufacturing labor force that was female, and the relative wage of females
(Wf/Wm) .

From 1830 to 1850 further changes, perhaps in the form of neutral technical

change in manufacturing, continue to exert upward pressure on (wf/wm) and on the
proportion of all females in manufacturing, but the female share of the manufacturing sector labor force declines.

-4-

Thus our conception of the first half of the nineteenth century is one of two

stages. The initial transition, from small artisan (male intensive) shops to
larger (female intensive) factories, could have involved a search along an iso-

quant. While physical capital accumulation may have been the force behind this
transition in certain industries, it was not universal in its influence. After this
initial shift in the organization of work, later changes can be modeled as involving only neutral technical change in the manufacturing sector.

The widely held notion that the early censuses of manufacturing were markedly
deficient

of

has limited our knowledge about various aspects of the initial phase

industrialization. While these sources have numerous flaws, their overall value

has been vastly underrated, and although they have been utilized by many economic
historians, they have not previously been sampled systematically.

We have

relied extensively on samples drawn from three of them: the 1820 schedules of the
Federal Census of Manufactures; a survey of manufacturing firms conducted by the
Treasury Department, known as the 1832 McLane Report; and the 1850 schedules of the
Federal Census of Manufactures.

II

Available evidence on the allocation of the labor force indicates that the
process of industrialization was well under way in the northeastern states by
the third decade of the nineteenth century, but a detailed record does not
begin until 1840 or later.

The composition of the industrial labor force

is one of the subjects about which information has been lacking. Descriptions
of the early industrial labor force in the Northeast

prominance

of females and

have always pointed to the

children in particular industries and in particular

regions. But a comprehensive estimate of their representation in the manufac-

-5-

turing labor force and its correlates could not be undertaken without the
recently collected samples of manufacturing firm data.
These bodies of evidence reveal that a large proportion of the entire
industrial labor force across the Northeast was composed of women and children.

Our estimates, presented in Table 1, indicate that the percentage of all manufacturing workers composed of these groups in the Northeast achieved an historical peak of over 40% (32.4% + 8.5%) during the initial phase of industrialization.

Their fraction of the industrial labor force in the Northeast had already exceeded 30% (8.9% + 23.1%) by 1820 and still remained over that level by 1850,

despite having begun a long-term decline. Thus the substantial representation
of women and children in the manufacturing labor force seems to have developed
quite early and rapidly during the first half of the nineteenth century, but
then began a secular decline into the second half.

By focusing only on the data for females of all ages in Table 1 an even
clearer pattern emerges. In the Northeast in 1832, 32.4% of the entire manufacturing labor force was composed of females, but by 1850 it had dropped to

28.9%, if one includes the category 'clothiers and tailors' and to 24.1% if

one does not.

'Clothiers and tailors' seem to have been overcounted in 1850

relative to both the 1832 report and the 1860 census, and it seems likely that

home sewers were included in the 1850 figures (see footnote d, Table 1). A
similar trend is apparent in the Massachusetts data, which also include a figure
for 1837. Whether one includes home workshop production or not, the percentage
of the manufacturing labor force composed of females peaks sometime after 1837

but before 1850. We explore the sources of the decline in the female employment
share

of northeastern manufacturing in Section IV.

century and for Massachusetts over the entire period, have been computed in a

a1 calculating these estimates we assumed that, within size categories of
firms, the distribution of the labor force among the industries was correct, but made adjustments for the under—enumeration of small firms (or
the unrepresentative distribution of the labor force among size categories).
Instead of accepting the figures from the sample of 14% of the labor force
in the small category (1 to 5 employees), 23% in the medium (6 to 15 employees), and 64% in the large (over 15 employees), we employed 40%,
40%, and 20% in the respective size classes to prepare the reported estimate. See also footnote 9.
bThese figures were computed under the assumption that the same proportion of
children working for firms that failed to enumerate them separately by
sex were female, as was the case with those children working for firms of
the same industry and size class that did enumerate them separately. The
same method of adjusting for the under—enumeration of small firms that was
used in calculating the 1820 estimates has been employed here. We assumed
that 25% of the labor force was employed by small firms, 25% by the mediumsized firms, and 50% by the large firms. The distribution observed in
the 1850 sample of firms, which slightly under-represents large firms because the Rhode Island manuscripts were destroyed, is 18%, 15%, and 68%
in the respective size categories. See also footnote 9.

CThe figure for New England is 37.0 and that for the Middle Atlantic, 22.2
for 1850; comparable figures for 1860 are 35.2 and 22.4. Employment in
fisheries, mines, and quarries has been excluded for comparability with
other years.

dThe numbers in parentheses exclude clothiers and tailors, a category that
was undoubtedly undercounted in 1832. The 1860 Census of Manufactures was
the first to include a category for a clothing industry. The figures
for 1860 indicate only a slight rise in total employment in clothing from
1850, when only clothiers and tailors were counted, to 1860, thus raising
the possibility that the 1850 figures overcounted home sewers.
eThese figures include only boys.

The first figure includes only manufacturing workers in shops and factories;
that is, it excludes fisheries and palm leaf and straw hat workers. The
second figure includes palm leaf and straw hat workers. The number of
these workers is given by: L = [v(2/3)/90] where V is the value of output
in this industry. This calculation is explained in Table 9, notes to column
(4). These figures slightly understate the percentage female because small
industries did not enumerate employees by sex. It was assumed, however, for
the case of printed cloth that women were 75% of the labor force, which
was their percentage in cotton textiles. Workers in the fishing and whaling
industry were not included in the total figures.

Notes:

The term "children" was used in the Census of Manufactures in 1820 without a
clear definition. In several cases enumerators indicated that they included
children up to 17 years old in this category. The 1870 through 1890 censuses
make clear that "children" meant boys < 16 years and girls <
15 years.
There has been much confusion over the 1850 and 1860 returns, but the
manuscripts of the 1850 Census of Manufactures imply that "all females"
and "all males" were the categories used. We have used these definitions
despite the fact that the 1880 printed census, Vol. 2, reports that
the 1850 and 1860 censuses counted only adults. The 1880 and 1890 figures
for adult females, all ages, assume that 28.9% of all children in manufacturing were female. Those for Massachusetts used 38.8%. These percentages were derived form the occupations given in the 1880 Census of
Population, in Report on the Manufactures of the U.S. at the 10th
Census, Vol. 2 (1883), p. xxx.

straightforward mariner, those reported for the years most critical to our

findings, 1820 and 1832, are drawn from a set of estimates. These estimates have
been constructed by varying several assumptions about the severity of parti-

cular sample selection biases that afflict the underlying sources. Extensive
sensitivity tests indicate that our qualitative findings are not affected by
variations in these assumptions over a plausible range.

Comparable labor force estimates cannot be constructed for females and

children in the pre-1820 economy. Nevertheless, it seems likely that their
prominence

in the manufacturing labor force around 1820 was a recent development.

Women and children may have been active in household manufacturing, but few seem

to have labored in the small manufacturing firms (typically with fewer than

five workers) that generally characterized
be

seen in Table 3.

Larger

the proto-industrial economy, as will

enterprises were not established in

significant

numbers until the burst of industrial expansion ushered in by the Embargo of
1807 and the War of 1812, and it was probably during this period that the proportion of manufacturing workers composed of females and children began to increase
10

substantially.

Cotton and wool textiles were among the first manufacturing industries to
experience rapid arid substantial increases in output during the early nineteenth

century. It should thus not be surprising that the growth of these two industries,
both known to utilize female arid child labor intensively, accounted for much

of the initial increase in the employment of these groups. Indeed, in 1820, not
long after industrial expansion had begun, nearly 70% of the adult females in
the manufacturing sector labored in the textile industries (as indicated in

Table 2). The concentration of females and children in textiles does not,
however, indicate that firms in other industries had labor forces that were

the 1832 and 1837 Massachusetts figures.
As noted in the text, the 1820 Census of Manufactures had poor coverage of manufacturing firms in some areas and generally underenumerated small establishments. Since small firms employed very
few females, their under-representation should not greatly bias these
figures.

composed primarily of adult men. it reflects, instead, the large share of the
total industrial labor force accounted for by cotton and woolen textiles. As
industrialization proceeded, other manufacturing industries grew relative to
textiles, reducing the proportion of female workers in textiles to 34% by

1850.

11

.

.

Although less intensive in female and child labor than textiles,

many of the other prominent industries of this period (e.g. boots and shoes,
paper) had large fractions of their workforce composed of these classes of
workers.

12

Thus, the high proportion that women and children comprised of

manufacturing workers was not merely a product of the hiring of one or two
industries, and

it

continued for some time in the face of a relative decline of

textiles among all manufacturing industries.

The estimates of the percentage of manufacturing employees that were women
or children, by industry and size of firm, presented in Table 3 provide further
evidence that these groups were a major component of the labor force in many

industries other than textiles, especially in larger establishments. Among the
establishments in the larger size class (over 15 workers), roughly 54% of the
employees were women or children in 1820, 59% were in 1832, and over 40% were

in 1850. Even excluding the four industries listed separately in Table 3, each
of which relied extensively on female and child labor, women and children
continue to account for well over 20% of the workers in each of the three years.
The data also suggest that, within industries, as the size of a firm or
its scale of production increased, so did the proportion of the firm's workforce

made up of women and children. In the 1850 boots and shoes industry, for example,
only 7.8% of the workers in small firms (1 to 5 workers) were female, while
24.1% and 41.5% of those in intermediate (6 to 15 workers) and

large

size classes

respectively were. Only very few industries do not conform to this general
pattern. While one might question whether the observed relationshiop between
size of firm and labor composition is a product of other variables correlated

Notes and Sources:

These percentages were computed from the samples of manufacturing firms drawn from the
1820 and 1850 Censuses of Ianufactures and the 1832 McLane Report. The figures in parentheses report thep c'ttge of female and child workers (only females in 1850) in that
industry. In the 1820 figures, "femalest' include only adult women, probably over 16
years. In the 1850 figures, "females" include females of all ages. McLane Report
enumerators typically grouped females of all ages in a separate category, although
some firms reported boys and girls
together. The above figures were computed
by assuming that firms that combined boys and girls
had the same ratio of girls
to boys as did other firms in the same industry and size class. Thus, the 1832 "children"
percentages should be interpreted as the percentages of boys, not all children.
The McLane Report, with the exception of Massachusetts, generally undercounted small
manufacturing firms, and this sample selection bias was especially severe for New
York and Rhode Island, in which establishments other than large-scale textile firms
were virtually excluded. As a consequence, the size distribution of firms from our
1832 sample is skewed toward the larger firms, and textile firms are over-represented.
These biases however, do not necessarily affect the data in this Table, which is stratified by both size class and industry.

-14-

separately with these, the regressions appearing in Table 4 indicate otherwise.

Even after controlling for variables such as region, level of urbanization, and
industry, the size of a firm remains a powerful predictor of the proportion of

its labor force composed of women and children. The coefficient on the log of
the number of employees is significant to the 1% level in each of the three
samples of manufacturing firms (1820, 1832, and 1850) analyzed.

The finding that larger firm size was associated in many industries with
a higher proportion of female and child employees suggests that the displacement
of artisan shops by establishments organized as factories served to increase the
share of these group,s in the manufacturing labor force. The statistical relationship indicates some of the consequences of the utilization of the factory
system, and also bears on why such methods of production were increasingly

adopted during the early phase of industrialization. Advances in mechanization
are frequently acknowledged to have contributed to the increased utilization of
females and children, but many non-mechanized industries also experienced similar

changes in firm organization. Habakkuk has argued that the diffusion of the
new technologies was at least partially the outcome of vigorous efforts by

American manufacturers to conserve on the utilization of male labor. But the methods
that could have served to accomplish this goal were many, among them the substitution of capital for labor, the use of available labor supplies more intensively (increasing the pace of production), and the substitution of a relatively cheap class of workers for an expensive one.

13

The relationship between firm size and the employment of women and children
within industries indicates that the diffusion of new, large-scale technologies

was associated with the substitution of women and children for men. In some
industries, such as textiles and paper, these new technologies were capital intensive, but other industries seem also to have altered their production methods,

Notes and Sources:

The intercept, for the 1820 and 1832 regressions, represents a paper mill in the Middle
Atlantic. The 1850 intercept reflects a Middle Atlantic firm in the wool industry.
These regressions were estimated across all firms in the 1820, 1832, and 1850 samples
that reported the necessary information. The definition of the dependent variable and
the set of independent variables varied somewhat from census to census. The 1850 regression
uses [females/employees] as the dependent variable because boys were not separately enumerated from men, and each regression uses a different set of industry dummies. Several
industry dummies included in the 1820 regression have been omitted to conserve space.

industries as dissimilar as glass and shoes have suggested that such changes in

glass but also to blow, cut, and flatten it. In 1820 this
When

was still common in many of the smaller factories. Those
operated on a larger scale frequently had assistants or
apprentices who relieved the blowers of certain of the more
minor and unskilled steps of the process. In time the division of labor was greatly elaborated; four separate trades
eventually emerged from the process of making cylinder window
glass. 15

He [Gideon Howard, a manufacturer of shoes in South Randolph,
Massachusetts] had a "gang" over in his twelve-footer who
fitted, made and finished: one lasted, one pegged and tacked
on soles, one made fore edges, one put on heels and "pared
them up," and in case of handsewed shoes, two or three sewers
were needed to keep the rest of the gang busy.
. . these groups
of men in a ten—footer gradually took on a character due to
specialization demanded by the markets with higher standards
and need of speed in output. Instead of all the men working
there being regularly trained shoemakers, perhaps only one
would be, and he was a boss contractor, who took out from a
central shop so many cases to be done at a certain figure and
date, and hired shoemakers who had "picked up" the knowledge
of one process and set them to work under his supervision.
One of the gang was a laster, another a pegger, one an edgemaker, one a polisher. Sometimes, as business grew, each of these
operators would be duplicated. Such work did away with the
old seven-year apprenticeship system.l6
.

Because females and boys were generally enumerated separately from adult
males, the substitution of women and children for men in the larger establishments
may only be one easily observed aspect of a more general phenomenon, the

substitution of unskilled labor for skilled labor. The small manufacturing
shops of the period typically consisted of a few artisans, perhaps with an

-18-

apprentice, and the limited division of labor within such firms allowed only a

small fraction of their employees to be unskilled. Larger firms were more
likely to have implemented an organization of work that involved a separation of

tasks and allotted a greater share of positions to unskilled workers. The definition of uunskilledt? is a matter of degree, and it is perhaps an over-simplification
to use sex and age as proxies for skill.

17

While women and children did accumu-

late skills on the job, their limited job training, actual and anticipated in the
case of females, led them to have acquired fewer skills than did adult men.

Indivisibilities associated with the application of a supervisory input may also
have contributed to the increase in females and children with the scale of firms.
The productivity of these laborers, particularly the young, could have been
disproportionately affected by the addition of supervision, either through an
improved coordination of the efforts of workers, through a more intense pace of
work, or through the use of piece-rate wages, among other methods of ensuring a
disciplined work regime.

18

III

We have argued that the initial phase of industrialization in the U.S.

was characterized not only by a great expansion of the manufacturing sector in the
Northeast, but also by a shift to the factory system and toward technologies

utilizing an extensive division of labor within the firm. Why both of these
developments occurred during the early nineteenth century is an issue of great

complexity and beyond the scope of this work. But it is clear that many factors,
such as technological change, economies of scale, tariffs, falling transport
19

costs, and more efficient capital markets could each have played a significant role.
Given any combination of events sufficient to stimulate a shift toward large-scale

-19-

production methods, however, manufacturers in a region where female and child labor
were relatively cheap would have had a great incentive to adopt such methods.

Similarly, if one compares across industries at given factor price ratios, the
industry that was most intensive in female and child labor would be most likely
to locate in a region with an initially low ratio of female to adult male wages. 20
Population density might also have been a critical factor since the drawing off
of a substantial labor force from a sparsely populated hinterland would have been
more costly.

21

Wage rate data for women and children prior to the industrialization of
the Northeast are scarce, and even when such data are found, they have often
already been affected by the quick upward response of female and child wages that
occurred when opportunities for work in manufacturing establishments became available.

22

While we have some data

bearing on agricultural wage rates prior to

industrialization, our best evidence on the pre-industrial period comes from the

commentary of those who lived through these transitionary times. Bodies of
evidence such as the censuses of manufactures allow us to compute estimates for
the ratio of the female wage to that of adult males at several points during the

early industrialization of the Northeast. While other sources for wage rates
exist for certain industries, these censuses enable us to compute estimates of

the average wage across the entire manufacturing sector. All available evidence
we have located confirms our assumption that the wage rate estimates from our 1832
and 1850 samples represent average wages for a particular group of laborers in
a particular firm.

23

Our estimates of the relative wage of females to adult males for pre-industrial
New England and for New England and the Middle Atlantic during early industrialization are presented in Table 5

24

Wage ratios in the pre-industrial Northeast were

significantly lower than were those prevailing in the same region after industrial

-20-

development, and the wage rates of females were bid up substantially relative to

those of adult males during the initial period of industrialization. We

by its increase as the region moved from

to industry, an increase from 0.29 to 0.46 . In the Middle Atlantic,

increase within the manufacturing sector was even more substantial, rising from

0.30 in 1820 to 0.51 by 1850 •25 This 1850 Middle Atlantic level was almost
90% of the ratio of 0.58 achieved by 1885 in manufacturing and roughly maintained
at least until 1960

26

Because the data in the 1832 and 1850 samples aggregated

females of all ages but those beginning with 1870 did not, the rapid increase in
the wage ratio during the early period is even more impressive. 27
Our findings of a rapid and steep increase in this wage ratio are consistent
with the observations of many contemporaries of the early nineteenth century
who reported that the relative productivity (and wages) of women (and children)
compared to adult men was low in the agricultural and traditional sectors of the

pre-industrial northeastern economy. For example, Albert Gallatin, previously
Secretary of the Treasury, noted in 1831 that:

female labor employed in manufactures appears from the
rate of their wages to be more productive than if applied
to the ordinary occupation of women. 28
A year later, two northeastern manufacturers, surveyed by the McLane Report as
to the employment opportunities for children outside manufacturing, responded that:
"Children cannot be advantageously employed, and can get no wages" and "children,
under sixteen, cannot obtain wages; their board and washing is generally considered

of about as much value as their labor (Vol. II, p. 73 and p. 77)." While these
observations may suggest the existence of a disequilibrium in the labor market, most
respondents to the McLane Report added that wages rapidly adjusted upward in both

and Sources:

1815: This ratio is computed from information contained in Carrol Wright,
Sixteenth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Labor of Massachusetts, (Boston,

1885), which gives 50/week for females (employed as domestics) and 86.8/day
for males (employed in agriculture) without board. The female figure does not
appear to include a value for board, and one of $1/week has been assumed. A
six—day work week was also assumed in order to calculate the weekly wage for
males.
1820: Because the information on wages in the 1820 Census of Manufactures
was reported as an annual wage bill for all employees, estimates of the female
to male wage ratio were derived from a set of wage regressions, available from
the authors, run over the firms contained in the 1820 sample. The procedure
used is as follows. Estimates of the wage rates for adult males, adult females,
and children were retrieved from the firm data by estimating equation:

The intercept of the equation, the base wage of an adult male, must be combined
with the contribution of the other appropriate independent variables to compute
the estimated wage for the particular class of employees. The male and female
wage rates were estimated separately, for several industries, before calculating
a set of wage ratios from which males or females were employed, as well as the
subset of firms over which the equation is estimated. We have reported the
average wage ratio, with the range appearing in brackets below. The wage estimates
were computed for an average firm which (depending on the subset of firms) was
located in a county with 60% of its labor force in agriculture.
-

1832(a): The 1832 estimates of the female to adult male wage ratios (Wf/Wm)
are derived from wage regressions run over a sample of manufacturing firms
drawn from the McLane Report. Adult male and female wages were estimated for
a number of industries from the regressions appearing in Table 6, and a set of
wage ratios was then computed from them. The wage estimates were calculated
from the regression coefficients for a firm with the average number of workers
(for that industry), that was located in a county where 40% of the population
resided in urban areas. The average wage ratio is reported, with the range of
estimates appearing below it in brackets.
1832(b):
These ratios utilize the 1832(a) female wage estimates, but are
divided by 1832 wage rates for common laborers in Lebergott, Manpower in American
Economic Growth. . . , p. 541. The New England estimate is Lebergott's, adjusted
for a value of $1.50/week board. Lebergott's estimate of the 1832 wage for
common laborers in the Middle Atlantic is, however, implausibly high. It implies
that common laborers were paid higher wages than were the employees of most
manufacturing industries, and that the nominal wage for common laborers fell
in the Middle Atlantic between 1832 and 1850, while rising significantly in
New England. Thus, instead of employing Lebergottts estimate of 96/day,
we use a figure of 75.5/day, obtained by two independent methods. We have
derived this estimate by applying the New England—Middle Atlantic wage differential
from the regressions over manufacturing firms (in percentage terms) to the New
England wage for common laborers. In addition, an average of the common laborer
wage rates given by Donald Adams, "Wage Rates in the Early National Period:
Philadelphia, 1785-1830," Journal of Economic History, XXVIII (Sept. 1968), pp.
404-26, and Jeffrey- Zabler, "Further Evidence on American Wage Differentials,"
q1orations in Economic History, 10 (Fall 1972), pp. 109-17, yields an almost
identical estimate.
1850(a) :
The 1850 estimates of (wf/w ) estimates are based on the 1850(a)
female wage estimates, but utilize Lebergo't's estimates of the wages for common
laborers in 1850 for the male wage.

the

agricultural and manufacturing sectors. "[T]he manufacturing interest has

tended to depress that of the agriculturalist. . .on account of the expense of

labor" was the conclusion of an agent in New Hampshire (Vol. I, p. 742), and a
correspondent in New York stated that "if those now engaged in the factories were
thrown out of employ, wages [in domestic work] would probably be reduced

(Vol. II, p. 22)." Further support of our contention that industrial expansion
in the Northeast increased the relative wage of women and children is provided
by Henry Carey, whose analysis of wage rates written just after the McLane Report
revealed that:

agricultural labor has not varied materially in these
forty years [1793 to 1833] in its money price. . . the
wages of men having been very steadily about nine dollars
per month [with board]. . . [but] the wages of females have

greatly advanced being nearly double what they were forty
years

since. 29

The agreement between our estimates and the perceptions of early nineteenth
century observers would seem to place the finding of an increase in the relative

wage of females on a sound basis. One possible explanation of the coincidence
of this rise with the increase in the female share of the manufacturing labor
force is that the diffusion of new methods of production boosted the relative
productivity of women and children in manufacturing, leading to a substitution

of such workers for adult males, and a surge in the demand for them. This conjecture can account for the growing proportion of employees that were female
within (and across) industries, as well as the increase in the relative wage.
It should be emphasized that the expansion of the manufacturing sector alone
does not adequately explain the observed phenomena.

In a two-sector model in

which manufacturing is the sector relatively intensive in female labor, demand
induced growth or neutral technical change with exogenously determined output prices,
would produce an increase in the relative wage of females, but it would also imply

an increase in the male share of the manufacturing labor force. Such a change in

-24-

factor

proportions in manufacturing did take place, as we indicate in Table 1,

after about 1840.

The increase in the relative wage for females and children might be rationalized
in ways other than those that are consistent with our explanation, but our

evidence does not substantiate these alternative explanations. Workers who
migrated to the manufacturing sector from the agricultural (or traditional) sector
may have suffered a deterioration in working and ambient conditions for which

they had to be compensated. In this view, the relative wages of females and
boys increased because these groups required greater compensatory payments,
in percentage terms, for laboring in industrial establishments than did adult
men.

of

The increase in relative wages rather than being produced by a shifting out

demand for women and children, results here from an inward shift in the

supply of such labor. Although differences in the proportion of the wage required for compensation may seem peculiar, it is possible that the labor supply
of women and children was more sensitive to working conditions and environment
than was that of men.

This conjecture can be investigated by utilizing the information contained
in the samples of manufacturing firm data from 1832 to 1850. One should be
able to determine the existence and magnitude of such a hypothesized compensation

by estimating the relationship between wage rates and working conditions. The
chief problem with this approach is the difficulty of obtaining a measure of

the conditions for which workers demanded compensatory differentials. We have
used the number of employees in the firm and the extent of urbanization in the
local county as proxies for working conditions and environment, and regressed
the wage for the particular class of employees on these variables and on dummy
variables for industry and region.

Three

regressions, one each for men, females, and

boys

were run across

the 1832 firm data and are presented in Table 6. Although adult males appear
to have earned significantly higher wages in urban areas, the compensation paid

to females and boys seems to have been unrelated to urbanization. The contrast suggests that even had the higher wages to men in urban areas represented
compensation for a less pleasing environment, the relative wages of females and
boys

would have fallen as the manufacturing labor force became more concentrated

in urban areas. The absence of an urban-rural wage differential among females
and boys suggests that the urban wage premium for men was produced by differences
in skill levels between urban and rural areas and by obstacles to migratory
flows.

Despite dissimilar patterns in the variation of their wages over the
urbanization variable, adult male and female workers were alike in receiving

higher rates of compensation in larger manufacturing establishments. The
elasticity of the wage with respect to the number of employees in a firm is

estimated to have been about 0.03 for both categories of workers. The coefficient for boy workers is of the same magnitude, but barely significant statis-

tically. These estimates imply that there would have been no increase in relative
wages had the size distribution of firms for each category of workers remained

the same. A greater increase in the size of firms employing females than in the

Notes and Sources: (Table 6, continued)
These regressions were estimated over those firms in the 1832 McLane Report
sample which reported the necessary information in an apparently accurate fashion.
Annual wages were computed from the daily or weekly wages reported by assuming
310 days or 52 weeks of work per year. The table presents the regression coefficients with t—statistics appearing in parentheses. The intercept represents
the annual wages of the particular class of employees in a Middle Atlantic paper
mill. Although it varied somewhat over regressions, the average firm was
located in a county where roughly 30% of the population resided in urban areas.
The equation for the adult male wage was estimated over all firms hiring at least
one adult male; that for the female wage was run over firms employing at least

-27-

size of those employing males could generate a relative advance in the formerts

wage. The estimated increase could not have been produced by such changes since
our computations were based on the assumption that the average firm size within

each industry applied equally to men, females, and boys. 31 Thus the use of
a measure of size of firm also fails to support the view that the increase in
relative wages was due to female (or boy) employees commanding higher compensatory (percentage-wise) payments than adult male employees.

Although the estimated relationships between wage rates and size of firm
do not seem to account for the increase in the relative wages of females, they
are consistent with the hypothesized existence of compensatory payments for all

classes of labor. There are, howeveT, alternative explanations for the rise
in wage rates over firm size. Accepting the characterization of large-scale
manufacturing establishments as employing many unskilled workers along with a
group of highly skilled or supervisory workers, it might be argued that adult

male supervisors earned wages that more than offset the lower wages of unskilled
males. The female pattern might similarly be attributed to the variation in
skill mix over firm size.32 Another plausible explanation is that larger firms
paid higher wages because such enterprises were more likely to exhaust local
supplies and premia had to be offered to attract individuals from outlying areas.33
Finally, since our wage figures are based on reports of daily or weekly rates,
one might suppose that the finding of higher wages in larger firms was an artifact due to their operating more hours per day. An analysis of information contained in the McLane Report, however, indicates that the number of hours in
operation daily was unrelated to firm size.34

A similar set of regressions on the 1850 data, appearing in Table 7, also
tends to refute the notion that the rise in the relative wages of females can
be explained by a deterioration of working or living conditions and the need

to compensate employees for it. As in 1832, male wages were positively related

to the degreeof urbanization in the vicinity of the firm, and female wages were

not. Male wages in 1850 continued to increase with the size of firm, but female
wages no longer did. The apparent implication is that increases in industry firm
size over time would lead to a downward, rather than upward, movement in the
relative wages of females. Given that both variables seem only to have affected
male wages, it is unlikely that the increase in the relative wage of females
over time can be attributed to a greater need to compensate them for a deteriora—
tion in working conditions and environment.

These regression results provide additional evidence for our hypothesis
that early industrialization both enhanced the relative productivity of females
and children and increased the demand for their labor relative to that of adult
males.

Furthermore, the increase in the relative wage of females within the

agricultural and traditional sectors commented on by Carey and others, tends
to negate the view that the increase in manufacturing could be solely attribu-

table to a pattern of compensatory payments. The increase in the relative
wage in both sectors indicates a rapid and efficient adjustment in this labor

Notes and Sources:(Table 7, continued)

The male wage regression was estimated over those firms employing at least

one male and no females. By excluding those firms that employed females, we are
also excluding many of the establishments that hired boys. Since adult males
and boys were grouped together in the 1850 census, the wage rates for males

reported by such firms do not accurately reflect those for adult males. The
female wage regression was run over those firms employing both males and females.

market, in response to a greater increase in the demand for female workers rela-

tive to that for adult males. Our evidence seems consistent with the notion
that an expansion of the manufacturing sector, in combination with advances in
production methods that raised the relative productivity of females in manufacturing, led to a bidding up of the relative return to female (and child)

labor. In the context of a two-sector model, if the expansion of the manufacturing
sector, relative to agriculture, is induced by shifts in demand, neutral technological, or adult male-saving technological change, the wage of its intensive
factor (female labor) will rise relative to that of the intensive factor in
agriculture (adult male labor).

Iv

The early industrialization of the Northeast was accompanied not only by
a rise in the relative wages of women and children, but also by increases in the

rates of participation in the market economy of these two groups. These increases
in labor participation render the advances in relative wages even more impressive,
since the advances would have been even greater had the labor supply of women

and children been as inelastic as was that for adult males. A precise estimation
of changes in the labor participation of these groups cannot at present be made.
Nevertheless, since few women and children worked in northeastern agriculture
or household industry even during the pre-industrial period, their participation

in the market economy must have increased substantially.36 Contemporary observers
linked increases in the labor force participation of women and children to the

growth of the manufacturing sector. In his well-known Report on Manufactures,
Alexander

Hamilton argued that the growth of manufacturing would result in "the

employment of persons who would otherwise be idle" and that "in general, women and

children are rendered more useful, and the

latter more early useful, by manufacturing

-3137

establishments than they would otherwise be."

Forty years later, manufacturers

surveyed for the McLane Report appear to have shared the view that outside the
manufacturing sector, "females .

.

. had little else to do" and "girls and boys

have no other employment (Vol. II, p. 141)."
Wherever significant industrial development occurred, labor force partici-

pation rates for young women were quite high. In Tables 8 and 9 we present estimates
of a "manufacturing labor force participation rate" for young females in five

northeastern states and in the counties of Massachusetts. The figures express
the number of females counted in the various surveys and censuses as employed in
manufacturing as a percentage of the total female population 10 (or 15) to 29
years old in the particular state or county and are accordingly lower bounds to

a true labor force participation rate. However, the greater the number of employed
women over 30 years old, the less accurate is our proxy for this manufacturing

participation rate. There is, though, abundant evidence that during the early
period about 88% of women working in the large textile mills in Lowell were under
30 years old, and even in 1888, after manufacturing had become far more concentrated in urban areas, about 86% of all female industrial workers were under
38
30 years old.
The data in Table 8 must be interpreted in light of the severe under-

counting of firms in the McLane Report, for all states but Massachusetts. Although figures for 1832 are uniformly lower than are those in later years, a

correction for this under-enumeration would reduce these differences. In any event,
the 1832 manufacturing participation rate estimates, ranging across states from
12% to 27%, indicate that the manufacturing sector was attracting a substantial
portion of the population of young women in the Northeast.

In the early-industrial-

izing state of Massachusetts, for which reporting appears reasonably complete, onethird of all young females were employed in the manufacturing sector by 1850, if

These figures are the number of females who migrate to (or from) a county, on net, as a percentage of

Because of the wide age groupings given in the 1820 Census, this

"Full-time" equivalents were derived for both 1832 and 1837 based on information in the

working full-time produced 1.58 hats per day; each hat sold for 28 and each woman received 304: per day
on average. Laborers, therefore, received 2/3's of gross earnings. If the dollar value of straw

not well before. This level roughly equalled that prevailing in 1880. In other
states, as well, increases in the manufacturing labor force participation rate
of young females continued after 1850, but had by that date already reached
levels approaching those achieved twenty or thirty years later.

Recognizing that some young women were employed in alternative pursuits
such as domestic service and teaching, the crude manufacturing labor force

participation rates indicate that a high proportion of single women in New

England had been drawn into the market economy by the 1830's. Comparable
evidence on female labor force participation does not exist before 1832, but
the levels implied by the 1830's data must have been achieved quite rapidly,
since opportunities for the employment of females were limited prior to industrial

development. This conjecture is supported by our estimates for the counties of
Massachusetts in 1832 and 1837, presented in Table 9.

In the more industrialized

eastern counties (Essex, Middlesex, Bristol, Suffolk, and Norfolk), an extremely
high percentage of young single women, at least equal to the statewide total
prevailing near the end of the century, must have been employed in the manufac-

turing sector. The western counties more closely resembled a pre-industrial
region having far lower manufacturing labor force participation rates for females.
It is unlikely that the contrast between these two sets of counties could be
fully accounted for by employment of females in the agricultural and traditional
sectors or by migration to and within Massachusetts from 1820 to 1830.

The

last four columns in Table 9 contain estimates of net migration rates, computed
by the forward survivor method, of young women into Massachusetts counties over
the periods 1820-30 and 1830-40. The wide age categories used in the 1820 Census
of Population allow us only to calculate an 1820-30 migration rate for the 10-19
years age group. For the 1830-40 period, migration rates can be calculated for
three different age groups of young women (where the migration rate is expressed
as a percentage of the particular age group in the end year). Our estimates suggest

-36-

that,

in general, counties with high manufacturing labor force participation rates

appear to have experienced far greater in-migration by young women in the 1830 to

1840 period than from 1820 to 1830. The 1832 labor force participation figures
therefore reflect the migration of females over short distances within counties,
while the later figures indicate a migration across counties and to Massachusetts
from other parts of New England, Canada, and Europe. This heightened movement of
labor may explain why the coefficient on firm size in the 1850 wage regression
(Table 7) differed from that for 1832 (Table 6); firms may have initially been
faced with a fairly steep labor supply function which migration tended to lower.

Despite the continuing increase in the rate of participation by women
in the

manufacturing sector, the proportion of its labor force that they comprised

seems to have peaked prior to 1850. The movement of females into this workforce was eventually outweighed by the shift of adult males from agriculture to

manufacturing. Within the Northeast, we estimate the share (see Table 1) to have
declined from roughly 32% in 1832 to 29% in 1850 (24% without clothiers), and to

even lower levels later in the century. In Massachusetts, where state censuses
of manufacturing provide better documentation, the decline was fairly abrupt,
from 49% in 1837 (including workshop production) to 39% in 1850 (36% without
clothiers and tailors).

The change in the proportion of the manufacturing labor force

can

that was female

be decomposed into three parts: (1) the change in the female employment share

of particular industries by size class, (2) the change in industrial composition by
size class of firm, and (3) the change in the size distribution of firms across all

industries. Of these three components two of them tended to decrease the female

proportion of the manufacturing labor force. There was both a decline in the female employment share of particular industries, and a relative decline in industries

most intensive in female labor. A general shift to larger firms within industries
partially offset these two movements. A simple accounting of the sources of decline

-37-

in the female share of the manufacturing labor force from 1832 to 1850 indicates
the following:

The primary component appears to be industrial composition, although this factor
would be reduced somewhat if we fully included the clothing establishments.

The decline in the female share within industries by size class had a smaller
effect and one which was overpowered by the general increase in average firm size
within industries.

V

Our principal findings are: (1) that women and children composed a large
share (over 40% in 1832) of the entire manufacturing labor force during the initial
period of industrialization in the U.S., but that this share began a secular decline
as early as 1840; (2) that the wage of females (and boys) relative to that of
adult males rose wherever large scale manufacturing establishments spread and that
by 1850 this ratio had risen to almost 90% its long-term level; (3) that the
labor force participation of young unmarried women in the industrial counties of
the Northeast was, in 1832, high by late nineteenth century standards; and
(4) that the employment of females and boys was closely associated with production

processes used by large establishments. These features of the industrial workforce have not been completely overlooked, but their importance has been vastly
underrated since the time of Hamilton and Gallatin.

-38-

The prominence of women and children across industries in large-scale

establishments and
firms

and

the

disproportionate concentration of these groups in such

may help in understanding certain features of early industrialization

the

factory system. They suggest that the factory system may have been

important

even outside the mechanized industries, because it enhanced the pro-

ductivity of two previously under-utilized groups, who composed over one-third

of the entire population. The low initial relative productivity of females and
children in the pre-industrial Northeast, together with this region's relatively
dense population, may have been major factors in its early lead among all regions
in industrial development.

'The notion that abundant land provided an incentive for labor-saving technical

change can be traced back to many early nineteenth century observers. The best
known recent exposition of this argument is H.J. Habakkuk, American and British
Technology in the Nineteenth Century: The Search for Labor Saving Inventions,
(London, 1967), however see Richard Clarke and Laurence Summers, "The Labour Scar-

city Controversy Reconsidered," Economic Journal, 90 (March 1980), 129-39, for
a more formal modeling of the role of land availability in the process of indus-

trialization. While the major emphasis has been on the use of capital to conserve
on labor, Habakkuk recognized that females and children were also used (p. 65).
Stanley Lebergott, Manpower in American Economic Growth: The American Record Since
1800 (New York, 1964) contains an astute discussion of the substitution of female
and child for adult male labor and the workings of this early market in unskilled

labor (pp. 125-29). The literature on the substitution of females and children
for male labor in the British experience is extensive, see, for example, Ivy

Pinchbeck Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution (London, 1930), and Peter
Mathias The First Industrial Nation (London, 1969), Chapters 1 and 5.

coverage of most of the important industries, but with little systematic analysis

of handworkers. Here there could be minute division of labor, hence a decreasing
need for general skill, and constant supervision could ensure a more reliable
volume of production (p. 57)."

data on large enterprises. On the 1850 sample see Fred Bateman and Thomas Weiss,
A Deplorable Scarcity: The Failure of Industrialization in the Slave Economy
(Chapel Hill, 1981).

6The official title of the McLane Report is the Documents Relative to the Statistics
of Manufactures in the U.S., Vol. I and II, U.S. Congress, Serial Set Numbers 222
and 223, (Duff Green, 1833), named after the then Secretary of the Treasury, Louis

McLane. Each of the three data sets has problems that complicate the analysis.

Footnotes 3

Among the most serious defects is that the quality of the coverage differed substantially by geographic region and that small manufacturing establishments are

under-represented (in nearly all areas) in the 1820 and 1832 data. These sample selection biases prevent a straightforward calculation of aggregate totals,
but allow the computation of averages for classes of manufacturing firms, and

a re-weighting of them to arrive at manufacturing sector averages. Another
of our concerns is that the categories of information on employees and their wages
reported vary from census to census (or survey in the case of the McLane Report).
In the 1820 census, adult males and females were enumerated apart from children,

often separately listed as boys and girls. However only a total (annual) wage

bill was given. The 1832 McLane Report generally listed adult males separately
from boys less than seventeen years old, but grouped females of all ages together.
Although coverage and detail varied considerably by state, wages in the McLane
Report were typically given as a daily (or weekly) average wage for each class

of employees. The 1850 census distinguished only between males of all ages and
females of all ages, and wage data were reported as the average monthly wage
for each group.

7me proportion of the labor force employed in the different sectors can be
computed from information contained in the 1820, 1840, and 1850 Censuses

of Population. The data indicate that the share of the labor force in agriculture
was shrinking after 1820, if not before.

Although the 1820 and 1840 censuses were designed to includemen, women, and
children in their labor force estimates, the 1850 data were explicitly confined
to males over the age of fifteen.

8The data on employment by firm in the three major sources we have used is to be

interpreted as average yearly employment. In 1820 the respondents of many firms
clearly stated that this was their procedure. In 1832 New England employers were
asked by the McLane Report to give the average annual number of employees. The
1850 Census of Manufactures asked for the average monthly employment.
9The 1820 and 1832 proportions of the manufacturing labor force composed of women

and children were estimated by weighting the proportions for particular categories

of firms, to adjust for potential biases. Our method uses the definition

Pf =

both 1820 and 1832 is reflected in biased S.'s, and the disproportionate represent-

ation of New England firms in 1832 biases both the S.'sand X. . 's.

13

We have as-

sumed that the observedI..'s are unbiased, but have varied the assumptions about

the other weights.

The sample of firms from the 1820 Census of Manufactures was drawn from randomly
selected counties. Since the omission of firms from the census was apparently a
function of their size rather than industry, it seems reasonable to assume that the

sample X's are unbiased, but that the S.Ts are biased by the under-enumeration
of small establishments. The Table 1 estimate uses a conservative assumption about

the S distribution, that 40% of the labor force was in the small category (1 to

Footnotes 5

5 workers), 40% in the medium (6 to 15 workers), and 20% in the large category.

Assuming an equal division of the labor force among size classes (33.3% in each)
gives 10.6% of the manufacturing labor force composed of adult females and 25.0%

composed of children. A very extreme assumption of 25%, 25%, and 50% in the respective classes yields 12.8% adult females and 27.4% children.

The sample drawn from the McLane Report over-represents firms from New England,

particularly Massachusetts, and therefore it is likely that both the X..'s and the
Si '5

are biased. To check the sensitivity of our estimates, we have varied the as-

sumptions about both distributions. The 1832 estimate in Table 1 is based on the
sample X..'s and an assumption that 25%, 25%, and 50% of the labor force were employed

in the respective size classes. An assumption of 33.3% in each class yields an estimate of 26.5% females and 8.5% boys; an assumption of 18%, 15%, and 68% (the dis-

tribution observed in the 1850 sample), yields 38.6% females and 8.3% boys. Changing
the X.. 's to those observed
'3

in 1850 and keeping the S. . 's also at their 1850 levels,
'3

yields 26.5% females and 8.4% boys. Using 25%, 25%, and 50% for the Si's, but
taking the X..'s from 1850 yields 22.4% females and 8.6% boys. Since several of the
highly female-intensive industries, such as textiles, were in relative decline by
1850, this latter estimate is substantially biased downward.

'°See, for example, Arthur H. Cole, The American Wool Manufacture, 2 vols. (Cambridge,
1926); Blanche Hazard, The Organization of the Boot and Shoe Industry in
setts Before 1875 (Cambridge, 1921); and Caroline F. Ware, The Early New England Cotton
Manufacture: A Study in Industrial Beginnings (New York, 1931).
shown in Table 2, even Massachusetts, the textile center of the U.S.,

experienced a decline in the proportion of all employed females in manufacturing
working in textiles, from 48% in 1837 to 36% in 1850.

13A11 three of these ways of saving on a scarce factor of production were discussed
by Habakkuk in his American and British Technology. . .

.

The ensuing debate on

his work, however, focused solely on the substitution of capital for labor, in
spite of Habakkuk's clear acknowledgment of there having been several classes of
labor, some of which were associated with the use of capital (see p. 65 in par-

ticular). For examples of the debate, see Peter Temin, "Labor Scarcity and the
Problem of American Industrial Efficiency in the 1850's," Journal of Economic
History, XXVI (Sept. 1966), 277-98, and Robert W. Fogel, "The Specification Problem

in Economic History," Journal of Economic History, XXVII (Sept. 1967), 283-308.
14Regressions of the log (fixed capital/value added) across our 1832 firms indicate that only in textiles (wool and cotton) and paper was capital intensity
significantly and positively related to the percentage of the labor force com-

posed of women and children and to the total size of the labor force, (constructed

as a weighted average of thethree classes of labor). Across the entire sample of

'8While much of the literature on the role of the factory has stressed the importance of machines in accounting for the increase in the scale of firm from cottage
industry, another segment has pointed to the role of discipline and supervision.

21The role of population density in the industrial development of New England
is discussed in Ware, The Early New England Cotton Manufacture, p. 14.
221n his article on the Brandywine area of Delaware, which industrialized very

early, Adams reports nearly identical relative wages for females to males for

agriculture (domestic work) and manufacturing. See Donald Adams Jr., "Workers
on the Brandywine: The Response to Early Industrialization," Working Papers from

the Regional Economic History Research Center (1980) Vol. 3, No. 4. Ware,
The Early New England Cotton Manufacture (p. 241) reviews the evidence on the increase in the wages of domestics during this period.
23Firms in the McLane Report generally listed wage rates separately for men, fe-

males and boys. We have checked the information provided by some firms with
alternative sources of data, and have concluded that the reported wage rates were
averages, across skill classes, of the wage rates of all workers in the particular

category (i.e., females). For example, we checked the wage rates reported by
the Hamilton Manufacturing Company in Lowell, Massachusetts with the more extensive breakdown of female and male wages in that firm provided in Dublin, Women at
Work. ..,

p.

66. A number of firms explicitly indicated that their labor force figures

were annual averages. Since enumerators appear to have recognized the issues
involved and preferred annual averages, we suspect that most firms sought to

provide yearly averages. The firms included in the 1820 census also appear to have
generally sought to estimate and report the yearly averages of the labor force
figures.

There is no question that the wage rates from the 1850 Census should be viewed
as averages across skill classes for all workers in the particular category

(males or females). Wage data were provided in the form of separate monthly wage

bills for males and females. Firms in industries known to have employed many boys
reported male wage rates (male wage bill/number of male employees) that were

Footnotes 9

discernibly lower. It is unclear whether the labor force figures from 1850
are yearly averages or simply a count of workers during the most recent month.

In any event they do not involve the overcounting of workers with high annual
turnover.

24Estimates of the wage of boys relative to that of adult males are not presented

in Table 5, but are included in Goldin and Sokoloff, "The Relative Productivity
Hypothesis. .

." Tables

1 and 2. These ratios increase from about 0.15 in

agricultural New England in 1815 to from 0.41 to 0.45 in industrial New England

in 1832. We cannot compute a comparable figure for 1850 because children were
not listed as a separate category, see footnote 6.
250ur 1850 wage ratio (Wf/W) differs from that cited in Lebergott, Manpower in
American Economic Growth. .

. and used by Paul David in his work in technical

change in cotton textiles, Paul David, Technical Choice, Innovation and Economic
Growth: Essays on American and British Experience in the Nineteenth Century

(London,l975). The 1850 Census of Manufactures did not clearly state whether
there was a lower age limit for the laborers included, and the 1880 Census of
Manufactures, in a survey of trends, mistakenly claimed that the 1850 returns

covered only adult laborers. In fact, the 1850 returns surveyed firms about all
laborers, and thus the inclusion of boys in 1850 imparts a downward bias to the
1850 male wage when it is compared to the 1832 figure, for which boys are separated.
Thus the Lebergott-David data indicate a marked erosion in (Wf/Wm) from 1832 to
1850 and a sharp decrease in the male money wage over the same period. In constructing our 1850 figure we have used only industries inshich boys were a small
percentage of the labor force, thus eliminating the problem of noncomparability

of wages over time. This confusion over the meaning of the 1850 wage rates may

Footnotes 10

explain why Nickless, "A New Look at Productivity in the New England Cotton
Textile Industry. .

. ," obtains

different results from David by using skill

classes rather than sex distinctions.
It should be noted as well that these wage ratios are lower than the

ratio of the female wage to the adult male wage in the agricultural South. The
southern ratio was approximately 0.58 in 1860. See Table 1, Goldin and Sokoloff,
"The Relative Productivity Hypothesis. .

."

26The evidence on the ratio (Wf/W) in manufacturing from 1885 to 1960 is from
Claudia Goldin, Economic Change and American Women, (forthcoming).
27Some firms in 1832 did report wage rates separately for adult females and

girls. In such cases, we used only the adult female wage in the regressions.
Our method of computing the wage ratios in 1832 and 1850 has introduced another

downward bias. The calculations were based on the assumption that the average
size of firms employing females was the same as that of firms employing adult

males. Since wage rates were positively related to firm size, and females generally worked in larger establishments than men, the estimated male wage is biased

upward relative to the female wage. Hence, the estimated wage ratio will be
biased downward slightly.

30The extent of urbanization in the local county was calculated as the fraction
of the county population residing in cities with a population of 2500 or more.
Since the poor environmental conditions thought to have affected many industrial

Footnotes 11

workers were often linked to urban areas, our variable should be a reasonable

proxy. The size of the manufacturing firm (as measured by the number of workers)
might also be expected to constitute a useful proxy for undesirable working

conditions for which employees would require compensation. Early factories may
have had higher levels of noise and dirt than did the small shops (or the farms)

they replaced. These factories also appear to have been distinguished by a
more regimented organization of work.

.
There were some differences between increases int1e
size of firms employing

males and those employing females during this period. But these differences
do not materially affect our findings on increase in the relative wage of females.
32Yet another reason might be that larger firms had a more experienced and there-

fore a more skilled female workforce. The evidence on this conjecture
is not entirely unambiguous though. Nickless, "Changing Labor Productivity.

.

(Chapter 2) reports Layer's Nashua Mill data for 1833-1840 which indicate some
decline in turnover, but with no discernible differences between males and fe-

males. Dublin's data on mean years experience for females in the Hamilton Mills,
Women at Work. .

., p.

190, rise from 1836 to 1850. Thus the increase in exper-

ience can account for that in the real wage for women, but the increase in the

relative wage might not be explained by this factor alone. On the relationship
between experience and earnings in industry see Claudia Goldin, "The Work and
Wages of Single Women, 1870 to 1920," Journal of Economic History, XL (March

l980) 81-8.
33This explanation is well suited to the extremely large textile firms, whose
sites were determined primarily by the availability of water power and often had

to attract female employees from all over New England. It does not, however, seem
appropriate for manufacturing firms in general. One would expect such a wage

Footnotes 12

premium effect to be most prominent among large firms in rural areas, but the
inclusion of an interaction term between size of firm and urbanization fails
to sustain this conjecture.

34Several hundred firms included in the McLane Report provided information on

the average number of hours per day they operated. A series of regressions based
on the data from these firms yielded no statistically significant relationship

between firm size and number of hours in operation daily. That industrial
homework occasionally involved a shorter work day is confirmed by the McLane
Report correspondent from Rockingham, New Hampshire, who stated that such work
"is attended to by women and children, the wives and daughters of farmers, in

connexion [sic] with the other household duties (Vol. I, p. 623)." We have not
been entirely successful in isolating these "putting out" establishments.

351t should be noted that an increase in the relative wage for females and

children is not inconsistent with the finding of Jeffrey Williamson and Peter
Lindert, American Inequality: A Macroeconomic History (New York, 1981), that the
ratio of the unskilled to skilled male wage fell during the same period. The
apparent contradiction is reconciled in their forthcoming work on Britain,

British Inequality Since 1670, in which they differentiate between skilled
artisans in industries such as textiles and shoes on the one hand, and skilled
workers in the capital goods sector and the professional elite on the other.
36

In most of the pre-industrial Northeast, women, and to a lesser extent children,

seem to have worked only occasionally in the agricultural sector. See Percy
W. Bidwell and John P. Falconer, History of Agriculture in the Northern United
States (Washington D.C., 1925), especially p. 116 and p. 275, and our discussion
in Goldin and Sokoloff, "The Relative Productivity Hypothesis.
