    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore physicians\u2019 role in moderating compliance with recommended vaccinations. Using administrative data on the universe of Danish children and their healthcare providers, we first construct and validate a measure of providers\u2019 propensities to comply with recommended vaccinations from birth to age 6 based on a two-way fixed effects model. We then show the measure meaningfully affects uptake of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among adolescent patients, and speeds recovery from a media-induced crisis to perceived HPV vaccine safety. Providers affect decisions beyond those of their own patients, influencing patients\u2019 younger cousins\u2019 uptake by one-fifth as much as own patients.\n\n",
