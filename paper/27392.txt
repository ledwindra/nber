                                          ABSTRACT

In order to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education, we surveyed
approximately 1,500 students at one of the largest public institutions in the United States using an
instrument designed to recover the causal impact of the pandemic on students' current and
expected outcomes. Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. Due to
COVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% lost a job, internship, or a job offer,
and 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous.
One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to
COVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This
heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides; lower-income students are 55%
more likely to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19 than their higher-income peers. Finally,
we show that the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically
by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and
heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.

1     Introduction

    The disruptive effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have impacted almost all sectors of our society. Higher

education is no exception. Anecdotal evidence paints a bleak picture for both students and universities.

According to the American Council on Education, enrollment is likely to drop by 15% in the fall of 2020,

while at the same time many institutions may have to confront demands for large tuition cuts if classes

remain virtual.1 In a similar vein, students face an increasingly uncertain environment, where financial and

health shocks (for example, lack of resources to complete their studies or fear of becoming seriously sick),

along with the transition to online learning may have affected their academic performance, educational plans,

current labor market participation, and expectations about future employment.

    This paper attempts to shed light on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students. First,

we describe and quantify the causal effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on a wide set of students’ out-

comes/expectations. In particular, we analyze enrollment and graduation decisions, academic performance,

major choice, study and social habits, remote learning experiences, current labor market participation,

and expectations about future employment. Second, we study how these effects differ along existing so-

cioeconomic divides, and whether the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities. Finally, we present

suggestive evidence on the mechanisms behind the heterogeneous COVID-19 effects by quantifying the role

of individual-level financial and health shocks on academic decisions and labor market expectations.

    For this purpose, we surveyed about 1,500 undergraduate students at Arizona State University (ASU),

one of the largest public universities in the United States, in late April 2020. The fact that ASU is a large

and highly diverse institution makes our findings relevant for most public institutions in the country. The

survey was explicitly designed to not only collect student outcomes and expectations after the onset of the

pandemic, but also to recover counterfactual outcomes in the absence of the outbreak. Specifically, the survey

asked students about their current experiences/expectations and what those experiences/expectations would

have been had it not been for the pandemic. Because we collect information conditional on both states of

the world (with the COVID-19 pandemic, and without) from each student, we can directly analyze how

each student believes COVID-19 has impacted their current and future outcomes.2 For example, by asking

students about their current GPA in a post-COVID-19 world and their expected GPA in the absence of

COVID-19, we can back out the subjective treatment effect of COVID-19 on academic performance. The

credibility of our approach depends on: (1) students having well-formed beliefs about outcomes in the

counterfactual scenario. This is a plausible assumption in our context since the counterfactual state is a
   1 See, the New York Times article “After Coronavirus, Colleges Worry: Will Students Come Back?” (April 15, 2020) for a

discussion surrounding students’ demands for tuition cuts.
   2 In some cases, instead of asking students for the outcomes in both states of the world, we directly ask for the difference.

For example, the survey asked how the pandemic had affected the student’s graduation date.



                                                               2
realistic and relevant one - it was the status quo less than two months before the survey, and (2) there being

no systematic bias in the reporting of the data - an assumption that is implicitly made when using any

survey data.3

    Our findings on academic outcomes indicate that COVID-19 has led to a large number of students delaying

graduation (13%), withdrawing from classes (11%), and intending to change majors (12%). Moreover,

approximately 50% of our sample separately reported a decrease in study hours and in their academic

performance. The data also show that while all subgroups of the population have experienced negative

effects due to the outbreak, the size of the effects is heterogeneous. For example, compared to their higher-

income counterparts, lower-income students (those with below-median parental income) are substantially

more likely to delay graduation. Finally, we find that students report a decrease in their likelihood of taking

online classes as a result of their recent experiences. These effects are, however, more than 150% larger for

honors students, suggesting that, a priori, most engaged students strongly prefer in-person classes.

    As expected, the COVID-19 outbreak also had large negative effects on students’ current labor market

participation and expectations about post-college labor outcomes. Working students suffered a 31% decrease

in their wages and a 37% drop in weekly hours worked, on average. Moreover, around 40% of students lost

a job, internship, or a job offer, and 61% reported to have a family member that experienced a reduction

in income. The pandemic also had a substantial impact on students’ expectations about their labor market

prospects post-college. For example, their perceived probability of finding a job decreased by almost 20%,

and their expected earnings when 35 years old (around 15 years from the outbreak) declined by approximately

2.5%. This last finding suggests that students expect the pandemic to have a long-lasting impact on their

labor market prospects.

    We find that the substantial variation in the impact of COVID-19 on students tracked with existing

socioeconomic divides. For example, compared to their more affluent peers, lower-income students are 55%

more likely to delay graduation due to COVID-19 and are 41% more likely to report that COVID-19 impacted

their major choice. Further, COVID-19 nearly doubled the gap between higher- and lower-income students’

expected GPA.4 There also is substantial variation in the pandemic’s effect on preference for online learning,

with Honors students and males revising their preferences down by more than 2.5 times as much as their

peers. However, despite appearing to be more disrupted by the switch to online learning, the impact of

COVID-19 on Honors students’ academic outcomes is consistently smaller than the impact on non-Honors

students.
   3 This approach has been used successfully in several other settings, such as to construct career and family returns to

college majors (Arcidiacono et al., 2020; Wiswall and Zafar, 2018), and the causal impact of health on retirement (Shapiro and
Giustinelli, 2019)
   4 The income gap in GPA increased from 0.052 to 0.098 on a 4 point scale. It is significant at the 1% level in both scenarios.




                                                               3
   Finally, we evaluate the extent to which mitigating factors associated with more direct economic and

health shocks from the pandemic (for example, a family member losing income due to COVID-19, or the

expected probability of hospitalization if contracting COVID-19) can explain much of the heterogeneity

in pandemic effects. We find that both types of shock (economic and health) play an important role in

determining students’ COVID-19 experiences. For example, the expected probability of delaying graduation

due to COVID-19 increases by approximately 25% if either a student’s subjective probability of being late on

a debt payment in the following 90 days (a measure of financial fragility) or subjective probability of requiring

hospitalization conditional on contracting COVID-19 increases by one standard deviation. As expected, the

magnitude of health and economic shocks are not homogeneous across the student population. The average

of the principal component for the economic and health shocks is about 0.3-0.4 standard deviations higher for

students from lower-income families. Importantly, we find that the disparate economic and health impacts

of COVID-19 can explain 40% of the delayed graduation gap (as well as a substantial part of the gap for

other outcomes) between lower- and higher-income students.

   To our knowledge, this is the first paper to shed light on the effects of COVID-19 on college students’

experiences. The treatment effects that we find are large in economic terms. Whether students are overre-

acting in their response to the COVID-19 shock is not clear. Individuals generally tend to overweight recent

experiences (Malmendier and Nagel, 2016; Kuchler and Zafar, 2019). However, whether students’ subjective

treatment effects are “correct” in some ex-post sense is beside the point. As long as students are reporting

their subjective beliefs without any systematic bias, it is the perceived treatment effects, not actual ones, –

regardless of whether they are correct or not – which are fundamental to understanding choices. For example,

if students (rightly or wrongly) perceive a negative treatment effect of COVID-19 on the returns to a college

degree, this belief will have an impact on their future human capital decisions (such as continuing with their

education, choice of major, etc.).

   Our results underscore the fact that the COVID-19 shock is likely to exacerbate socioeconomic disparities

in higher education. This is consistent with findings regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on K-12 students.

Kuhfeld et al., 2020 project that school closures are likely to lead to significant learning losses in math

and reading. However, they estimate heterogeneous effects, and conclude that high-performing students are

likely to make gains. Likewise, Chetty et al., 2020 find that, post-COVID, student progress on an online

math program decreased significantly more in poorer ZIP codes. Our analysis reveals that the heterogeneous

economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19 is partially responsible for these varying impacts. This

suggests that by addressing the economic and health impacts imposed by COVID-19, policy makers may be

able to prevent COVID-19 from widening existing gaps in higher education.

2      Data

2.1         Survey

     Our data come from an original survey of undergraduate students at Arizona State University (ASU),

one of the largest public universities in the United States. Like other higher educational institutions in the

US, the Spring 2020 semester started in person. However, in early March during spring break, the school

announced that instruction would be transitioned online and that students were advised not to return to

campus.

     The study was advertised on the My ASU website, accessible only through the student’s ASU ID and

password. Undergraduate students were invited to participate in an online survey about their experiences

and expectations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which they would be paid $10. The study was

posted during the second to last week of instruction for the spring semester (April 23rd). Our sample size

was constrained by the research funds to 1,500 students, and the survey was closed once the desired sample

size was reached. We reached the desired sample size within 3 days of posting the survey.

     The survey was programmed in Qualtrics. It collected data on students’ demographics and family back-

ground, their current experiences (both for academic outcomes and non-academic outcomes), and their

future expectations. Importantly, for the purposes of this study, the survey collected data on what these

outcomes/expectations would have been in the counterfactual state, without COVID-19.


2.2         Sample

     A total of 1,564 respondents completed the survey.5 90 respondents were ineligible for the study (such

as students enrolled in graduate degree programs or diploma programs) and were dropped from the sample.

Finally, responses in the 1st and 99th percentile of survey duration were further excluded, leading to a final

sample size of 1,446. The survey took 38 minutes to complete, on average (median completion time was 26

minutes).

     The first five columns of Table 1 show how our sample compares with the broader ASU undergradu-

ate population and the average undergraduate student at other large flagship universities (specifically, the

largest public universities in each state). Relative to the ASU undergraduate population, our sample has a

significantly higher proportion of first-generation students (that is, students with no parent with a college

degree) and a smaller proportion of international students. The demographic composition of our sample

compares reasonably well with that of students in flagship universities. Our sample is also positively selected

in terms of SAT/ACT scores relative to these two populations.
    5 The   64 people taking the survey at the moment the target sample size (1,500) was reached were allowed to finish.


                                                                 5
    The better performance on admission tests could be explained by the high proportion of Honors students

in our sample (22% compared to 18% in the ASU population). The last four columns of Table 1 show how

Honors students compare with ASU students and the average college student at a top-10 university. We see

that they perform better than the average ASU student (which is expected) and just slightly worse than the

average college student at a top-10 university. The share of white Honors students in our sample (60%) is

higher than the proportion in the ASU population and much higher than the proportion of white students

in the top-10 universities.

    Overall, we believe our sample of ASU students is a reasonable representation of students at other large

public schools, while the Honors students may provide insight into the experiences of students at more elite

institutions.



3     Analytic Framework

    We next outline a simple analytic framework that guides the empirical analysis . Let Oi (COV ID-19) be

the potential outcome of individual i associated with COVID-19 treatment. We are interested in the causal

impact of COVID-19 on student outcomes:


                              ∆i (O) = Oi (COV ID-19 = 1) − Oi (COV ID-19 = 0),                             (1)


where the first term on the right-hand side is student i’s outcome in the state of the world with COVID-19,

and the second term being student i’s outcome in the state of the world without COVID-19. Recovering

the treatment effect at the individual level entails comparison of the individual’s outcomes in two alternate

states of the world. With standard data on realizations, a given individual is observed in only one state of the

world (in our case, COV ID-19 = 1). The alternate outcomes are counterfactual and unobserved. A large

econometric and statistics literature studies how to identify these counterfactual outcomes and moments of

the counterfactual outcomes (such as average treatment effects) from realized choice data (e.g., Heckman

and Vytlacil, 2005; Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Imbens and Rubin, 2015). Instead, the approach we use in

this paper is to directly ask individuals for their expected outcomes in both states of the world. From the

collected data, we can then directly calculate the individual-level subjective treatment effect. As an example,

consider beliefs about end-of-semester GPA. The survey asked students “What semester-level GPA do you

expect to get at the end of this semester?” This is first-term on the right-hand side of equation (1). The

counterfactual is elicited as follows “Were it not for the COVID-19 pandemic, what semester-level GPA

would you have expected to get at the end of the semester?”. The difference in the responses to these two



                                                       6
questions gives us the subjective expected treatment effect of COVID-19 on the student’s GPA. For certain

binary outcomes in the survey, we directly ask students for the ∆i . For example, regarding graduation plans,

we simply ask a student if the ∆i is positive, negative, or zero: “How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected

your graduation plan? [graduate later; graduation plan unaffected; graduate earlier].”

    The approach we use in this paper follows a small and growing literature that uses subjective expectations

to understand decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, Arcidiacono et al. (2020) and Wiswall and

Zafar (2018) ask college students about their beliefs for several outcomes associated with counterfactual

choices of college majors, and estimate the ex-ante treatment effects of college majors on career and family

outcomes. Shapiro and Giustinelli (2019) use a similar approach to estimate the subjective ex-ante treatment

effects of health on labor supply. There is one minor distinction from these papers: while these papers

elicit ex-ante treatment effects, in our case, we look at outcomes that have been observed (for example,

withdrawing from a course during the semester) as well as those that will be observed in the future (such

as age 35 earnings). Thus, some of our subjective treatment effects are ex-post in nature while others are

ex-ante.

    The soundness of our approach depends on a key assumption that students have well-formed expectations

for outcomes in both the realized state and the counterfactual state. Since the outcomes we ask about are

absolutely relevant and germane to students, they should have well-formed expectations for the realized state.

In addition, given that the counterfactual state is the one that had been the status quo in prior semesters

(and so students have had prior experiences in that state of the world), their ability to have expectations for

outcomes in the counterfactual state should not be a controversial assumption.6



4     Empirical Analysis

4.1     Treatment Effects

    We start with the analysis of the aggregate-level treatment effects, which are presented in Table 2. The

outcomes are organized in two groups, academic and labor market (see Appendix Table A1 for a complete

list of outcomes). The first two columns of the table show the average beliefs for those outcomes where the

survey elicited beliefs in both states of the world. The average treatment effects shown in column (3) are of

particular interest. Since we can compute the individual-level treatment effects, columns (4)-(7) of the table

show the cross-sectional heterogeneity in the treatment effects.
   6 This is different from asking students in normal times about their expected outcomes in a state with online teaching and no

campus activities (COVID-19) since most students would not have had any experience with this counterfactual prior to March
this year.




                                                               7
    We see that the average treatment effects are statistically and economically significant for all outcomes.

The average impacts on academic outcomes, shown in Panel A, are mostly negative. For example, the average

subjective treatment effect of COVID-19 on semester-level GPA is a decline of 0.17 points. More than 50%

of the students in our sample expect a decrease in their GPA due to the treatment (versus only 7% expecting

an increase). Additionally, on average, 13% of the participants delayed their graduation, 11% withdrew from

a class during the spring semester, and 12% stated that their major choice was impacted by COVID-19. An

interesting and perhaps unanticipated result is that, on average, students are 4 percentage points less likely

to enroll in an online class given their experience with online instruction due to the pandemic.7,8 However,

there is a substantial amount of variation in terms of the direction of the effect: 31% (47%) of the participants

are now more (less) likely to enroll in online classes. We explore this heterogeneity in more detail in the

next section, but it seems that prior experience with having taken online classes somewhat ameliorates the

negative experience: the average treatment effect for students with prior experience with online classes is a

2.4 percentage points decrease in their likelihood of enrolling in online classes, versus a 9.5 percentage points

decline for their counterparts (difference statistically significant at the 0.1% level).

    This large variation in the treatment effects of COVID-19 is apparent in several of the other outcomes,

such as study hours, where the average treatment effect of COVID-19 on weekly study hours is -0.9 (that is,

students spend 0.9 less hours studying per week due to COVID-19). The interquartile range of the across-

subject treatment effect demonstrates substantial variation, with the pandemic decreasing study time by 5

hours at the 25th percentile and increasing study time by 4 hours at the 75th.

    Overall, these results suggest that COVID-19 represents a substantial disruption to students’ academic

experiences, and is likely to have lasting impacts through changes in major/career and delayed gradua-

tion timelines. Students’ negative experiences with online teaching, perhaps due to the abruptness of the

transition, also has implications for the willingness of students to take online classes in the future.

    Turning to Panel B in Table 2, we see that students’ current and expected labor market outcomes were

substantially disrupted by COVID-19. As for the extensive margin of current employment, on average, 29%

of the students lost the jobs they were working at prior to the pandemic (67% of the students were working

prior to the pandemic), 13% of students had their internships or job offers rescinded, and 61% of the students

reported that a close family member had lost their job or experienced an income reduction. The last statistic

is in line with findings from other surveys of widespread economic disruption across the US.9 Respondents
   7 The questions that were asked to elicit this were: “ Suppose you are given the choice to take a course online/remote or

in-person. [Had you NOT had experience with online/remote classes this semester], what is the percent chance that you would
opt for the online/remote option?”
   8 This result is in line with a survey about eLearning experiences across different universities in Washington and New York

that concludes that 75% of the students are unhappy with the quality of their classes after moving to online learning due to
COVID-19.
   9 According to the US Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey Week 3, 48% of the surveyed households have experienced a




                                                              8
experienced an average decrease of 11.5 hours of work per week and a 21% decrease in weekly earnings,

although there was no change in weekly earnings for 52% of the sample, which again reflects substantial

variation in the effects of COVID-19 across students.

   In terms of labor market expectations, on average, students foresee a 13 percentage points decrease in

the probability of finding a job by graduation, a reduction of 2 percent in their reservation wages, and a

2.3 percent decrease in their expected earnings at age 35. The significant changes in reservation wages and

expected earnings at age 35 due to COVID-19 demonstrate that students expect the treatment effects of

COVID-19 to be long-lasting. This is consistent with Oreopoulos et al. (2012) which finds that graduating

during a recession implies an initial loss in earnings of 9% that decreases to 4.5% within 5 years and disappears

after 10 years. Rothstein (2020) estimates that the Great Recession may have even longer-lasting effects on

graduates’ employment.


4.2     Heterogeneous Effects

   We next explore demographic heterogeneity in the treatment effects of COVID-19. Figure 1 plots the

average treatment effects across several relevant demographic divisions including gender, race, parental

education, and parental income. Honors college status and expected graduation cohort are also included as

interesting dimensions of heterogeneity in the COVID-19 context. The figure shows the impacts for six of

the more economically meaningful outcomes from Table 2 (additional outcomes can be found in Figure A1).

   At least four patterns of note emerge from Figure 1. First, compared to their classmates, students from

disadvantaged backgrounds (lower-income students defined as those with below-median parental income,

racial minorities, and first-generation students) experienced larger negative impacts for the academic out-

comes, as shown in the first three panels of the figure.10 The trends are most striking for lower-income

students, who are 55% more likely to delay graduation due to COVID-19 than their more affluent class-

mates (0.16 increase in the proportion of those expecting to delay graduation versus 0.10), expect 30%

larger negative effects on their semester GPA due to COVID-19, and are 41% more likely to report that

COVID-19 impacted their major choice (these differences are statistically significant at the 5% level). For

some academic outcomes, COVID-19 had similarly disproportionate effects on nonwhite and first-generation

students, with nonwhite students being 70% more likely to report changing their major choice compared

to their white peers, and first-generation students being 50% more likely to delay their graduation than

students with college-educated parents. Thus, while on average COVID-19 negatively impacted several

measures of academic achievement for all subgroups, the effects are significantly more pronounced for socioe-
loss in employment income since March 13 2020.
  10 The cutoff for median parental income in our sample is $80,000




                                                             9
conomic groups which were predisposed towards worse academic outcomes pre-COVID.11 The pandemic’s

widening of existing achievement gaps can be seen directly in students’ expected Semester GPA. Without

COVID-19, lower-income students expected a 0.052 lower semester GPA than their higher-income peers.

With COVID-19, this gap nearly doubles to 0.098.12

    Second, Panel (d) of Figure 1 shows that the switch to online learning was substantially harder for some

demographic groups; for example, men are 7 percentage points less likely to opt for an online version of a

course as a result of the COVID-19 treatment, while women do not have a statistically significant change in

their online preferences. We also see that Honors students revise their preferences by more than 2.5 times

the amount of non-Honors students. As we show later (in Table 4), these gaps persist after controlling

for household income, major, and cohort, suggesting that the switch to online learning mid-semester may

have been substantially more disruptive for males and Honors students. While the effect of COVID-19 on

preferences for online learning looks similar for males and Honors students, our survey evidence indicates

that different mechanisms underpin these shifts. Based on qualitative evidence, it appears that Honors

students had a negative reaction to the transition to online learning because they felt less challenged, while

males were more likely to struggle with the learning methods available through the online platform.13 One

speculative explanation for the gender difference is that consumption value of college amenities is higher for

men (however, Jacob et al. (2018), find little gender difference in willingness to pay for the amenities they

consider).

    The third trend worth highlighting from Figure 1 is that Honors students were better able to mitigate

the negative effect of COVID-19 on their academic outcomes (panels a, b, and c), despite appearing to be

more disrupted by the move to online learning (panel d). Honors students report being less than half as

likely as non-Honors students to delay graduation and change their major due to COVID-19. Extrapolating

from these patterns provides suggestive evidence that academic impacts for students attending elite schools–

the group more comparable to these Honors students– are likely to have been small relative to the impacts

for the average student at large public schools.

    Finally, the last two panels of Figure 1 present the COVID effect on two labor market expectations and

show much less meaningful heterogeneity across demographic groups compared to the academic outcomes

in previous panels. This suggests that, while students believe COVID-19 will impact both their academic
   11 Based on analysis of ASU administrative data including transcripts, we find that, relative to their counterparts, first-

generation, lower-income, and non-white students drop out at higher rates, take longer to graduate, have lower GPAs at
graduation, and are more likely to switch majors when in college (see Appendix Table A3)
   12 The difference is significant at 1% in both cases.
   13 Honors students were as likely as non-Honors students to say that classes got easier after they went online but, conditional on

saying classes got easier, were 47% more likely to say “homework/test questions got easier.” Conversely, males were marginally
more likely to say classes got harder after they went online (10% more likely, p=0.055) and, conditional on this, were 14% more
likely to say that “online material is not clear”.




                                                                 10
outcomes and future labor market outcomes, they do not believe there is a strong connection between

these domains. Supporting this observation, the individual-specific treatment effect on semester GPA is

only weakly correlated with the individual-specific treatment effects on finding a job before graduation

(corr=0.0497, p=0.065) and expected earnings at 35 (corr=0.0467, p=0.077). The one notable exception to

the lack of heterogeneity in panels (e) and (f) of Figure 1 is the 2020 cohort, which on average revised their

subjective probability of finding a job before graduation three times as much as other cohorts. However,

students expecting to graduate in 2021 and later still believe that COVID-19 will impact their job market

outcomes; even students who plan to graduate in 2023 expect to be 6 percentage points less likely to find a

job before graduating due to COVID-19.



5     Mechanisms behind the COVID-19 Effects

    This section presents mediation analysis on the drivers of the underlying heterogeneity in the treatment

effects. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as both an economic and a health shock. However, these shocks may

have been quite heterogeneous across the various groups, and that could partly explain the heterogeneous

treatment effects we documented in the previous section.


5.1    Economic and Health Mediating Factors

    We proxy for the financial and health shocks due to COVID-19 by relying on a small but relevant set

of exogenous/predetermined variables. Financial shocks are characterized based on whether a student lost

a job due to COVID-19, whether a student’s family members lost income due to COVID-19, the change in

a student’s monthly earnings due to COVID-19, and the likelihood a student will fail to fully meet debt

payments in the next 90 days. To measure health shocks, we consider a student’s belief about the likelihood

that they will be hospitalized if they contract COVID-19, a student’s belief about the likelihood that they

will have contracted COVID-19 by summer, and a student’s subjective health assessment. Finally, in order

to summarize the combined effect of each set of proxies, we also construct principal component scores as

one-dimensional measures of the financial and health shock to students.14

    Table 3 reports summary statistics of the different economic and health proxies by demographic group.

Given the results in Figure 1, the remainder of the analysis will focus on three socioeconomic divisions:

parental income, gender, and Honors college status. Our data indicate that lower-income students faced

larger health and economic shocks as compared to their more affluent peers. In particular, they are almost

10 percentage points more likely to expect to default on their debt payments than their higher-income
 14 Eigenvalues   indicate the presence of only one principal component for each of the shocks.



                                                               11
counterparts. Additionally, lower-income students are 16 percentage points more likely to have had a close

family member experience an income reduction due to COVID-19. Regarding the health proxies, lower-

income students rate their health as worse than higher-income students and perceive a higher probability of

being hospitalized if they catch the virus. Finally, the differences in economic and health shocks between

lower and higher-income students, as summarized by the principle components of the selected proxy variables,

are statistically significant.

   Columns (5)-(7) of Table 3 show that both economic and health shocks are larger for non-Honors students.

In fact, the average differences in the principal component scores for both the economic and health factors

is larger for these two groups than for the income groups. Finally, the last three columns of the table show

that women experienced larger COVID-19 shocks due to economic and health factors. These differences

are partly driven by the fact that, in our sample, females are more likely to report that they belong to a

lower-income household than males (50% vs. 42%).

   In short, Table 3 makes clear that the impacts of COVID-19 on the economic well-being and health of

students have been quite heterogeneous, with lower-income and lower-ability students being more adversely

affected.


5.2    The Role of Economic and Health Shocks on Explaining the COVID-19
       Effects

   To investigate the role of economic and health shocks in explaining the heterogeneous treatment effects

(in section 4.2), we estimate the following specification:


                         ∆i = α0 + α1 Demogi + α2 F inShocki + α3 HealthShocki + i ,                    (2)


where ∆i is the COVID-19 treatment effect for outcome O on student i. Demogi is a vector including

indicators for gender, lower-income, Honors status, and dummies for cohort year and major. F inShocki and

HealthShocki are vectors containing the shock proxies or their principal component. Finally, i denotes an

idiosyncratic shock.

   The parameters of interest are α2 and α3 . A causal interpretation of these parameters hinges on the

identification assumption that F inShocki and HealthShocki are independent of i . In our context, we

believe that this assumption is reasonable given that F inShocki and HealthShocki contain variables that

capture arguably exogenous changes due explicitly to the COVID-19 outbreak or were determined before the

pandemic began. For example, it is reasonable to assume that a family member losing a job or a student’s

baseline health status is independent of the idiosyncratic term. On the other hand, if a student losing a


                                                       12
job or missing a future debt payment is correlated with idiosyncratic factors that are also likely to affect

the change in the student’s outcomes (such as change in graduation timing), the identification assumption

would be invalid. In this case (where the omitted factors are positively correlated with the shock proxies),

the overall ability of the proxies to explain the treatment effect may then be interpreted as an overestimate

of the true role of each type of shock in shaping treatment effects. Thus, in the presence of unobservable

variables, we should be cautious in interpreting the coefficients on the proxy variables.

   Table 4 shows estimates of equation (2) for four different outcomes (Appendix Table A2 shows the esti-

mates for additional outcomes). For each outcome, five specifications are reported ranging from controlling

for only demographic variables in the first specification to controlling for both economic and health factors

in the fourth specification. Finally, the last column includes only the principal component of each shock

to provide insight about overall effects, given that certain shock proxies show high levels of correlation (see

appendix Table A4 for the correlations within each set of proxies).

   Several important messages emerge from Table 4. First, both shocks are (economically and statistically)

significant predictors of the COVID-19 effects on students’ outcomes. In particular, F-tests show that the

financial and health shock proxies are jointly significant across almost all specifications.15 This is also

reflected in the statistical significance of the principal components. Moreover, the fact that the effect of key

proxy variables remains robust when we simultaneously control for both shocks demonstrates the robustness

of our results. For example, we find that a 50 percentage point increase in the probability of being late on

debt payments increases the probability of delaying graduation and switching majors due to COVID-19 by

6.9 and 6.4 percentage points, respectively. These effects are large given that they represent more than half

of the overall COVID-19 treatment effect for these variables. Similarly, we find that an analogous increase

in the probability of hospitalization if contracting COVID-19 leads to a 6 and 5 percentage points increase

in the probability of delaying graduation and switching majors due to COVID-19.

   Second, in terms of labor market expectations, we find that the change in the expected probability of

finding a job before graduation strongly depends on having a family member that lost income (which is also

correlated with the student himself losing a job). In particular, the size of this effect represents 32% of the

overall COVID-19 treatment effect. Therefore, this finding suggests that students’ labor market expectations

are driven in large part by personal/family experiences.

   Third, although the proxies play an important role in mediating the pandemic’s impact on students, there

is still a substantial amount of variation in COVID-19 treatment effects left unexplained. Across the four

outcomes in Table 4, the full set of proxies explain less than a quarter of the variation in outcomes across

individuals. Appendix Figure A2 visualizes this variation by plotting the distribution of several continuous
 15 The   only exception is the financial shock when explaining changes in the probability of taking classes online.



                                                               13
outcomes with and without controls. While the interquartile range noticeably shrinks after conditioning on

the proxy variables, these plots highlight the large amount of variation in treatment effects remaining after

conditioning on the proxies.

    Finally, our results show that the financial and health shocks play an important role in explaining the

heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, columns (4) and (9) demonstrate that

economic and health factors together can explain approximately 40% and 70% of the income gap in COVID-

19’s effect on delayed graduation and changing major respectively. The gap between Honors and non-Honors

students is likewise reduced by 27% and 39% for the same outcomes. Taken together, these results imply

that differences in the magnitude of COVID-19’s economic and health impact can explain a significant

proportion of the demographic gaps in COVID-19’s effect on the decision to delay graduation, the decision

to change major, and preferences for online learning. These results are important and suggest that by

focusing on mitigating the economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19, policy makers may be able

to significantly prevent COVID-19 from exacerbating existing achievement gaps in higher education.



6     Conclusions

    This paper provides the first systematic analysis of the effects of COVID-19 on higher education. To

study these effects, we surveyed 1,500 students at Arizona State University, and present quantitative evidence

showing the negative effects of the pandemic on students’ outcomes and expectations. For example, we find

that 13% of students have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Expanding upon these results, we show

that the effects of the pandemic are highly heterogeneous, with lower-income students 55% more likely to

delay graduation compared to their higher-income counterparts. We further show that the negative economic

and health impacts of COVID-19 have been significantly more pronounced for less advantaged groups, and

that these are partially responsible for the underlying heterogeneity in the impacts that we document. Our

results suggest that by focusing on addressing the economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19, as

measured by a relatively narrow set of mitigating factors, policy makers may be able to prevent COVID-19

from widening existing achievement gaps in higher education.

Notes: Data winsorized below 5% and above 95%. Controls include cohort fixed effects, major fixed effects,
and the economic/health proxies in Table 3. Conditional distribution adjusted to preserve unconditional
mean. Within each plot: middle line represents median, edges of box represent interquatile range (IQR),
edge of whisker represents the adjacent values or the 25th(75th) percentile plus(minus) 1.5 times the IQR.
Outlier observations past adjacent values plotted as individual points.
