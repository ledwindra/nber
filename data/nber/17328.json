    "abstract": "\n\nThe potential for rare macroeconomic disasters may explain an array of asset-pricing puzzles.  Our empirical studies of these extreme events rely on long-term data now covering 28 countries for consumption and 40 for GDP.  A baseline model calibrated with observed peak-to-trough disaster sizes accords with the average equity premium with a reasonable coefficient of relative risk aversion.  High stock-price volatility can be explained by incorporating time-varying long-run growth rates and disaster probabilities.   Business-cycle models with shocks to disaster probability have implications for the cyclical behavior of asset returns and corporate leverage, and international versions may explain the uncovered-interest-parity puzzle.  Richer models of disaster dynamics allow for transitions between normalcy and disaster, bring in post-crisis recoveries, and use the full time series on consumption.  Potential future research includes applications to long-term economic growth and environmental economics and the use of stock-price options and other variables to gauge time-varying disaster probabilities.\n\n",
