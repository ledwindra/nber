Bullying among Adolescents: The Role of Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Skills
Miguel Sarzosa and Sergio Urzúa
NBER Working Paper No. 21631
October 2015
JEL No. C34,C38,I21,J24
ABSTRACT
Bullying is a behavioral phenomenon that has received increasing attention in recent times. This paper
uses a structural model with latent skills and longitudinal information from Korean youths to identify
the determinants and effects of bullying. We find that, unlike cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills
significantly reduce the chances of being bullied during high school. We use the model to estimate
average treatment effects of being bullied at age 15 on several outcomes measured at age 18. We show
that bullying is very costly. It increases the probability of smoking as well as the likelihood of feeling
sick, depressed, stressed and unsatisfied with life. It also reduces college enrollment and increases
the dislike of school. We document that differences in non-cognitive and cognitive skill endowments
palliate or exacerbate these consequences. Finally, we explore whether investing in non-cognitive
skills could reduce the occurrence of bullying. Our findings indicate that the investment in skill development
is key in any policy intended to fight the behavior.

Introduction

Bullying has been placed under the spotlight in many parts of the world in recent years.
This behavioral phenomenon is by no means new, but it has increasingly become a
predicament among young people. Frequent cases of suicide in school and college aged
kids around the world keep reminding societies of the perils and immense costs that
bullying victims—and communities in general—have to bear.
Psychologists have defined a bullying victim as a person that is repeatedly and intentionally exposed to injury or discomfort by others, with the harassment potentially
triggered by violent contact, insulting, communicating private or inaccurate information and other unpleasant gestures like the exclusion from a group (Olweus, 1997). This
explains why this behavioral phenomenon typically emerges in environments characterized by the imbalances of power and the needs for showing peer group status (Faris and
Felmlee, 2011). Not surprisingly, schools are the perfect setting for bullying. The combination of peer pressure with the multidimensional heterogeneity of students, together
with a sense of self-control still not fully developed, makes schools a petri dish for this
improper behavior.
Bullying is not only widespread, but very costly.1 According to official statistics, approximately 160,000 children miss school every day in the United States because of fear
of being bullied (15% of those who do not show up to school every day); one of every ten
students drops out or changes school because of bullying; homicide perpetrators were
found to be twice as likely as homicide victims to have been bullied previously by their
peers; bullying victims are between two to nine times more likely to consider suicide

Anti-bullying campaigns and laws have been implemented in the US, Canada, UK, Germany,
Scandinavia, Colombia and South Korea.

than non-victims.2 In the United Kingdom, at least half of suicides among young people
are related to bullying. Surprisingly, with few exceptions, the economic literature has
mostly stayed away from research efforts to understand the bullying phenomenon.
Suicides and bullying also go hand in hand in the Republic of Korea (South Korea),
the country we examine in this paper. Every day one school-aged Korean (ages 10 to
19) commits suicide, the country’s largest cause of death among individuals between 15
and 24 years of age.3 The fierce academic competition resulting from the high value the
society gives to education, which in turn makes school grades and test scores extremely
high stake events, has been identified as one of the reasons behind the phenomenon. In
fact, South Korean households spend 0.8% of the GDP per year out of their pockets on
education (more than twice the OECD average) and after-school academies or hagwon
are increasingly popular.4 The ultra-competitive high-pressure environment has fueled
a climate of aggression that frequently evolves into physical and emotional violence, the
underlying factor behind the nation’s large number of students reporting to have been
bullied every year (more than 77,000 in 2013). In fact, the problem of school violence is
so prevalent that in an effort to curb this unwanted behavior in 2012 the South Korean
government installed 100,000 closed circuit cameras in schools, and since 2013 private
insurance companies offered bullying insurance policies.5
This paper assesses the determinants and medium-term consequences of being bullied.

See stopbullying.gov.
According to the World Health Organization, the overall suicide rate in South Korea is among
highest in the world with 28.9 suicides per 100,000 people (2013).

The degree of competition is such that there are hagwons exclusively dedicated to prepare students for the admission processes of the more prestigious hagwons. These investments are not remedial measures. They do not aim at helping less proficient individuals to keep up with their
classmates. Instead, they are intended to make good students even better than their peers. Such
are the incentives to study extra hours that the government had to prohibit instruction in hagwon
after 10PM. See www.economist.com/news/asia/21665029-korean-kids-pushy-parents-use-crammersget-crammers-cr-me-de-la-cram and www.economist.com/node/21541713.

Our empirical analysis is carried out using South Korean longitudinal information on
teenagers, which allows us to examine the extent to which cognitive and non-cognitive
skills can deter the occurrence of this unwanted behavior, and also how they might
palliate or exacerbate its effects on several outcomes, including depression, life satisfaction, the incidence of smoking, drinking, health indicators and the ability to cope with
stressful situations.6
Our conceptual framework is based on a structural model of endogenous bullying, multiple outcomes and latent skills. As we described below, the model is flexible enough
to incorporate several desirable features. First, it recognizes that cognitive and noncognitive measures observed by the researcher are only proxies of the true latent skills
(Heckman et al., 2006a). Second, the model treats bullying as an endogenous behavior
caused, to some extent, by individual’s skills and socio-economic characteristics. Third,
flexible functional form assumptions used in the estimation of the latent skills guarantee the flexibility to recreate the patterns observed in the data. Fourth, the structural
model allows us to simulate counterfactuals for individuals with different skill levels,
which are then used to document heterogenous treatment effects of bullying on several
outcomes. Finally, the model does not assume linearity in the estimation. In fact,
simulations show that the estimated effects of skills on the outcomes analyzed are very
non-linear.
The paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess the determinants and consequences of bullying
while dealing with the problems caused by the selection into becoming a victim or a
6

In this paper we follow the literature and define cognitive skills as “all forms of knowing and
awareness such as perceiving, conceiving, remembering, reasoning, judging, imagining, and problem
solving” (APA, 2006), and non-cognitive skills as personality and motivational traits that determine
the way individuals think, feel and behave (Borghans et al., 2008).

perpetrator of bullying, providing insights that can potentially motivate interventions
to reduce their incidence. Second, we provide medium-term impacts of school victimization. In particular, the longitudinal information allows us to examine the transition
from high school to adulthood, so we can identify the effects of early victimization on
different outcomes observed during a decisive period of development. Third, we provide
evidence on how cognitive and non-cognitive skills affect the likelihood of being bullied.
Namely, we find that a one standard deviation increase in non-cognitive skills reduces
the probability of being bullied by 37%. Fourth, we find that skills not only affect
the probability of victimization, but they also palliate the consequences of bullying in
subsequent years. In particular, we find that cognitive skills reduce the incidence of bad
habits, such as drinking and smoking, proportionally more among bullying victims than
among non-victims. Fifth, we quantify the effects bullying has on several behavioral
outcomes. For instance, we find that being bullied at age 15 increases the incidence of
sickness by 75%, the incidence of mental health issues by 50%, and raises stress levels
caused by friendships by 20% of a standard deviation, all by age 18. We also find that
there are differential effects of bullying victimization across skill levels. We document
that bullying increases depression by 25% of a standard deviation in students from the
bottom decile of the non-cognitive skill distribution, and reduces the likelihood of going
to college by 10 to 18 percentage points in students that come from the lower half of
the non-cognitive skill distribution. We also find that bullying increases the likelihood
of smoking by 8.5 percentage points for students in the lowest decile of the cognitive
skill distribution.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 puts our research in the context of the
literature analyzing bullying. Section 3 describes our data. In Section 4, and following
the existing literature, we present reduced form results of the impact of bullying on
5

different outcomes. Section 5 explains the empirical strategy we adopt in this paper.
Section 6 presents and discusses our main results. Section 7 concludes.

Related Literature

Psychology and sociology literatures have been prolific in terms of descriptions of bullying as a social phenomenon. Findings from Smith et al. (2004), for example, show
that bullying victims have fewer friends, are more likely to be absent from school, and
do not like break times. This literature has also documented that younger kids are
more likely to be bullied and that this phenomenon is more frequent among boys than
among girls (Boulton and Underwood, 1993; Perry et al., 1988). Interestingly, Olweus
(1997) found that school and class size are not significant determinants of the likelihood
of bullying occurrence. Furthermore, Ouellet-Morin et al. (2011) showed that bullying
victims’ brains have unhealthy cortisol reactions that make it difficult to cope with
stressful situations, and according to psychological research, bullied children possess in
general less favorable self-evaluation (self-esteem), and have a negative view of their
situation (Björkqvist et al., 1982; Olweus, 1997).
These analyses, although descriptive, provide critical guidelines for the specification
of our empirical model. In particular, the characterization of the victims highlights
the importance of controlling for skills, particularly non-cognitive dimensions, when
analyzing the determinants and potential consequences of bullying.
But unlike in sociology and psychology, economic research on bullying is very scarce.
At least two reasons explain this. First and foremost, the lack of information about
bullying in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies; and second, the fact that
6

selection into this behavioral phenomenon is complex and not random. In this context,
the consequences of being bullied can be confounded by the intrinsic characteristics
that made the person a victim or a perpetrator in the first place. And while few papers
in economics have been able to analyze long longitudinal data, the efforts to control for
selection have been more limited.
Brown and Taylor (2008), for example, estimate linear regression models using ordinary
least squares (OLS) and ordered probits to examine the associations between bullying
and educational attainment as well as wages in the United Kingdom. Their findings
suggest that being bullied (and being a bully) is correlated with lower educational attainment and, as a result, with lower wages later in life. Eriksen et al. (2012), on the
other hand, use detailed administrative information from Denmark and reduced form
regressions (OLS and fixed-effect models) to document strong and robust correlations
between bullying and 9th grade test scores, teenage pregnancy, use of psychopharmachological medication, height and weight at age 18. Although these are novel efforts,
they only indirectly deal with the potential non-randomness of the bullying “treatment”.
By implementing an instrumental variable strategy to control for the endogeneity of
bullying, Eriksen et al. (2014) try to deal with this criticism. Using the same data
set as in Eriksen et al. (2012), they instrument the effect of teacher-parent reported
bullying victimization on 9th grade GPA with the proportion of classroom peers whose
parents have a criminal conviction. They confirm that bullying reduces GPA, although
the estimates are clouded by the low variation of the instrument and by the possible
district-neighborhood clustering of convicted parents that may relate with the endogenous sorting of students into schools/classrooms. These findings might also be subject
to additional qualifications as the instrumental variable strategy does not necessarily
identify causal effects when the selection intro treatment (bullying) is driven by unob7

served heterogeneity (latent skills) (Angrist and Imbens, 1994; Heckman et al., 2006b).
Our strategy does control for this.
Our work also relates to the literature evaluating the impact of conduct disorders during
childhood and adolescence, as bullying can be conceptualized as one. Le et al. (2005),
for example, bundle bullying with several other conduct disorders such as stealing,
fighting, raping, damaging someone’s property on purpose and conning, among others.
Using an Australian sample of twins, these authors control for the potential endogeneity
arising from genetic and environmental factors. From the estimation of linear regression
models, they find that conduct disorders were positively correlated with dropping-out
from school and unemployed later in life. However, they are unable to deal with the
endogeneity that might arise from intrinsic individual-level unobservable characteristics
influencing both the conduct disorder and the outcome variables they assess.
Our approach is different from those in the existing literature in several ways. First,
our empirical strategy incorporates the identification of unobserved heterogeneity in
the form of cognitive and non-cognitive skills, showing that both dimensions are key
determinants of the treatment and outcomes examined.7 Second, even though our
empirical strategy does not rely on exclusion restrictions in the instrumental variable
sense—the structure imposed assumes that the outcomes and treatment equations are
independent from each other once we control for observable characteristics and the
latent skills (Heckman et al., 2006a)—we use a feature of the Korean schooling system,
namely the random allocation of students to classrooms, as a source of exogenous
variation affecting the probability of being victimized.8 Third, we provide medium7

The literature has shown that cognitive and non-cognitive skills are critical to the development of
successful lives (see for example Murnane et al., 1995; Cawley et al., 2001; Heckman and Rubinstein,
2001; Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Heckman et al., 2006a; Urzua, 2008).

our empirical strategy in Section 6.1.1 and footnote 19.

term impacts of school victimization on behavioral outcomes. That is, we acknowledge
that bullying affects the victims’ lives beyond school, and consequently, we quantify its
impacts on other future dimensions (e.g., health status, risky behaviors, social relations,
life satisfaction and college attendance). Finally, unlike previous studies analyzing the
behavioral phenomenon, our empirical strategy follows the recent literature on skill
formation (Cunha and Heckman, 2008) and considers cognitive and non-cognitive skills
not only as mechanisms that determine the chances of being bullied, but also as traits
that palliate or exacerbate its negative effects.

Data

We use the Junior High School Panel (JHSP) of the Korean Youth Panel Survey (KYP).
The KYP-JHSP is a longitudinal survey that started in 2003 sampling a group of second
year junior high-school students (i.e., 14 year olds) who were then interviewed once a
year until 2008, covering the transition from high-school into the beginning of their
adult life. The data fully describes this process including rich longitudinal information
on higher education choices from those that go to college and early employment choices
for those not enrolling in college.
The sample consists of 12 regions including Seoul Metropolitan City. Children were
sampled according to the proportion of the second year junior high-school students
present in each region. The resulting panel consists of 3,449 youths and their parents or
guardians (see descriptive statistics in Table 1). Subjects were consistently interviewed
in six waves.9 Each year, information was collected in two separate questionnaires: one
9
As in any longitudinal survey, attrition is always an issue. By wave 2, 92% of the sample remained;
by wave 3, 91% did so; by wave 4, 90%; and by wave 5, 86% remained in the sample.

for the teenager, and one for the parents or guardians.
As this is a sensitive age range regarding life-path choices, the KYP-JHSP provides a
unique opportunity to understand the effects of cognitive and non-cognitive skills on
multiple behaviors. It pays special interest in the life-path choices made by the surveyed
population, inquiring not only about their decisions, but also about the environment
surrounding their choices. For example, youths are often asked about their motives
and the reasons that drive their decision-making process. Future goals and parental
involvement in such choices are frequently elicited as well.
Besides inquiring about career planning and choices, the KYP-JHSP inquires about
academic performance, student effort and participation in different kinds of private
tutoring. The survey also asks about time allocation, leisure activities, social relations,
attachment to friends and family, participation in deviant activity, and the number
of times the respondent has been victimized in different settings. In addition, the
survey performs a comprehensive battery of personality questions from which measures
of self-esteem, self-stigmatization, self-reliance, aggressiveness, anger, self control and
satisfaction with life can be constructed.
While the youngsters are often asked about the involvement of their parents in many
aspects of their life, parents and guardians answer only a short questionnaire covering
household composition and their education, occupation and income.
The Construction of Non-Cognitive Measures. The KYP-JHSP contains a comprehensive battery of measures related to personality traits. Among them, we select the
scales of locus of control, irresponsibility and self-esteem. Locus of control relates to the
extent to which a person believes her actions affect her destiny, as opposed to a person
that believes that luck is more important than her own actions (Rotter, 1966). People
10

with internal locus of control face life with a positive attitude as they are more prone to
believe that their future is in their hands (Tough, 2012). The irresponsibility measure
relates negatively to perseverance and grit, that is, the ability to overcome obstacles
and giving proportionally greater value to large future rewards over smaller immediate ones (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005). Finally, self-esteem provides a measure of
self-worth.
The choice of these variables is backed by research in economics and psychology that
shows that each of these personality traits are important determinants of future outcomes and the likelihood of victimization. For instance, works like Duckworth and
Seligman (2005), Heckman et al. (2006a) and Urzua (2008) show that the unobserved
heterogeneity captured by these measures are strong predictors of adult outcomes. In
fact, our results presented in the Appendix A attest to that.10 In the same vein, psychology literature like Björkqvist et al. (1982), Olweus (1997) and Smith and Brain
(2000) provide evidence that shows that traits chosen correlate with school bullying
victimization. People with external locus of control or a higher degree of perseverance
may have a greater inclination to avoid/change a victimization situation. On the other
hand, self-esteem may be proxying unobservable characteristics that make a school-age
individual more popular and sociable, therefore affecting her chances of being bullied
(Hodges and Perry, 1996).
It should be noted that most of the socio-emotional information in the KYP-JHSP is
recorded in categories that group the reactions of the respondent in categories from
“strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. In consequence, and following common practice
in the literature, we constructed socio-emotional skill measures by adding categorical
answers of several questions regarding the same topic. This method incorporates some
10

In footnote 18 we comment these results in detail.

11

degree of continuity in the scores, which is essential for our estimation procedure. The
questions used can be found in Appendix B, and Table 2 show the descriptive statistics
of the constructed measures.
Academic Performance. Although the KYP-JHSP has a rich battery of behavioral
questions, it is somewhat limited regarding cognitive measures. Ideally, we would like
to have measures closely linked to pure cognitive ability. However, the lack of such
measures forces us to infer cognitive ability from grades and academic performance.
In particular, we use the scores obtained in tests of i) math and science; ii) language
(Korean) and social studies; and iii) overall school grades reported every year. See
Table 3 for the descriptive statistics of these measures.
Importantly, previous literature has shown that academic performance is not orthogonal
to non-cognitive skills (Borghans et al., 2011). In other words, the production function
of academic test scores has to be modeled using both cognitive and socio-emotional
skills as inputs. As will be shown in Section 5, our model takes into account this
feature of the data and incorporates it into the estimation.
Bullying. In the KYP-JHSP, bullying is self-reported by the students. It refers to
events where they have been severely teased or bantered, threatened, collectively harassed, severely beaten, or robbed. Therefore, it relates to the more direct and less
subtle versions of bullying. The ones, according to psychological research, children
tend to focus more on (Naylor et al., 2010). The reported incidence of bullying in the
KYP-JHSP, presented in Table 4, is in line with the incidence reported in international
studies for the ages studied (see Smith and Brain (2000), for a summary).
Outcomes. The outcomes we consider include depression, the likelihood of smoking,
drinking, and college attendance, life satisfaction, self reported physical and mental
12

health, and standardized indexes of stress. All these are measured by age 18.
Specifically, we analyze an index of depressions which is constructed based on a battery
of questions that assess its symptoms. Self reported physical health, on the other
hand, measures whether the respondent considers she is in good health or not. The
mental health outcome captures whether the respondent has been diagnosed to have
psychological or mental problems. Regarding the stress measures, we use five outcome
measures. The first four quantify how stressed the respondent gets regarding her friends,
her parents, school and poverty. The last stress measure captures the stress levels
associated with self-image. We also examine the impact of early bullying on college
attendance by age 19. Descriptive statistics of the outcome variables are presented in
Table 4.

Reduced Form Results

We would like to inquire about the effect of bullying at time t, Dt , on the outcome
of interest measured at time t + h, Yt+h . Following the literature (Brown and Taylor,
2008; Eriksen et al., 2012), we posit the following regression model:

Yt+h = XY β + γDt + et+h

(1)

where XY is a matrix with all observable controls and et+h denotes the error term.
In this paper we assume that bullying is an endogenous behavior driven by individual
characteristics (latent skills) potentially correlated with the error term, so we would
expect Dt 6⊥ et+h (conditional on XY ). This prevents the direct interpretation of the
OLS estimator of γ as a causal effect, but the availability of proxies for skills can help
13

to mitigate the issue.
Let T be a vector containing individual-level cognitive and non-cognitive test scores. In
order to deter reverse causality, we assume these measures are taken before the bullying
episode occurs, that is at time t − 1. Thus, the regression equation becomes:

Yt+h = XY β + γDt + πTt−1 + νt+h

(2)

where the identification of γ relies on the conditional mean independence assumption
of the error term, νt+h , with respect to the set of controls (including test scores).
Table 5 shows the results from the estimation of (1) and (2) using the KYP-JHSP data.
The reduced form results suggest positive correlations between being bullied at 15 and
depression, the likelihood of being sick, life satisfaction and feeling stressed at 18. The
estimates, however, do not suggest significant correlations between being bullied and
drinking or smoking (age 18).
But findings from regressions like (2) are problematic. On the one hand, even after
controlling for test scores, Tt−1 , bullying Dt might be still endogenous. On the other
hand, the literature has documented that components of Tt−1 should only be interpreted
as proxies for skills (Heckman et al., 2006a). Therefore, as we confirm below, including
Tt−1 in the set of controls might not be enough to control for the potential sources of
biases arising from the endogeneity of bullying and the measurement error problems
produced by test scores. Our empirical strategy deals with these issues.

Empirical Strategy

In this paper, we not only assume that underlying cognitive and non-cognitive skills are
latent rather than observable, but also that they are determinants of—and the source
of dependence among— outcomes, treatment (bullying) and test scores.
The core of the empirical strategy follows Heckman et al. (2006a), so it assumes a linear
production function of test scores, whose inputs include both the individual observable
characteristics and the latent skill endowments.11 The insight provided by Kotlarski
(1967) allows us to use observed test scores to identify the underlying distributions from
which the realizations of latent endowments are drawn, facilitating the estimation of
the complete structural model.
The model is estimated using maximum likelihood, incorporating mixture of Gaussian
distributions to mimic the true underlying distributions of the latent skill endowments.
This feature of the model grants the flexibility required to replicate the data.12

5.1

The General Setup

The structural models we implement can be described as a set of outcome equations
linked by a factor structure with two underlying factors, θA and θB . In a general setup,
11

In fact, variance decompositions of the test scores presented in Figures 1 show that latent endowments explain between 5 to 10 time more the variation of the scores than the observable characteristics.
However, these figures also show that even after controlling for latent endowments more than half of
the variation of the scores is still unexplained. These findings go in line with our argument against
the use test scores as proxies for abilities in Section 4. The unexplained part of the variance of test
scores will correlate with νt+h in (2) biasing the results of the regressions. That is why we will rather
identify the latent endowments from the test scores.
12
The structural estimations presented in this paper were done using the heterofactor command
for Stata. See Sarzosa and Urzua (2015).

15

suppose we face the following system for each individual in the sample:

Y = XY β Y + αY,A θA + αY,B θB + eY

(3)

where Y is a M × 1 vector of outcome variables, XY is a matrix with all observable
controls for each outcome variable, αY,A and αY,B are vectors that contain the factor
loadings for each underlying factor (i.e., θA and θB ), and eY is a vector of independent
error terms (across individuals and outcomes) with distributions feym (·) for every m =

1, . . . , M . We assume that eY ⊥ θA , θB , XY . Furthermore, we assume the factors θA
and θB follow the distributions fθA (·) and fθB (·), respectively.
If M = 1 then Y = Y and (5) becomes

Y = XY β Y + αY,A θA + αY,B θB + eY

(4)

This general framework can be used to introduce a special case, relevant for this paper,
in which there is a binary treatment D (e.g., being bullied or not) and a vector of
subsequent factual and counterfactual outcomes, i.e., a model of potential outcomes
inspired by the Roy model (Roy, 1951). In particular, let D be a dummy variable
denoting whether or not an individual has a been victim of bullying and for the sake
of exposition clarity, let’s assume M = 1 (e.g., the outcome of interest is depression at
age 18). We posit the following model for D:


D = 1 XD β YD + αYD ,A θA + αYD ,B θB + eD > 0
where 1 [A] denotes an indicator function that takes a value of 1 if A is true, and XD
represents a set of exogenous observables. Let Y0 , Y1 denote an outcome of interest
16

(e.g., the likelihood of depression) for those with D = 0 and D = 1 respectively (e.g.,
non victims and bullying victims). Then, the system of equations (5) will represent
0

both potential outcomes and the choice equation. That is, Y = [Y1 , Y0 , D] where:

Y1 = XY β Y1 + αY1 ,A θA + αY1 ,B θB + eY1

if D = 1

(5)

Y0 = XY β Y0 + αY0 ,A θA + αY0 ,B θB + eY0


D = 1 XD β YD + αYD ,A θA + αYD ,B θB + eD > 0

if D = 0

(6)
(7)

where XY are a set of observable variables. Note that under our assumptions, although

D is endogenous, once we control for unobserved heterogeneity θA , θB , the error terms

eY1 , eY0 , eD are jointly independent. Hence, this empirical strategy controls for the
unobserved heterogeneity solving the problem of endogeneity (Heckman et al., 2006a).
Furthermore, as it uses the underlying the latent skills instead of observed test scores,
it avoids the measurement error problem affecting the reduced form results.
We complement our factor model with a measurement system of the form:

T = XT β T + αT,A θA + αT,B θB + eT

(8)

where T is a L × 1 vector of measurements (e.g., test scores), XT is a matrix with all
observable controls for each measurement, and αT,A and αT,B , are the loadings of the

unobserved factors. Again, we assume that θA , θB , XT ⊥ eT , that all the elements of
the L × 1 vector eT are mutually independent with associated distributions feh (·) for
every h = 1, . . . , L. We follow Carneiro et al. (2003) and secure the identification of the
factor loadings and underlying distributions (up to normalizations) imposing: θA ⊥ θB

is the number of factors. Therefore, the presence of two factors in (5) implies that there
should be at least five measures in (8). Finally, we normalize one loading associated
with each factor to one. This anchors the scale of each latent factor to a specific test
score. Other loadings should be interpreted as relative to those used as numeraires.13
We estimate the model using a two-stage maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure. The likelihood is

The basic idea behind the identification argument follows Kotlarski (1967). More precisely, if there
are three independent random variables eT1 , eT2 and θ and define T1 = θ+eT1 and T2 = θ+eT2 , the joint
distribution of (T1, T2 ) determines the distributions of eT1 , eT2 and θ, up to one normalization. Note
that, given that we have already identified all the loadings, we can write (8) in terms of Tτ = θ + eTτ
by dividing both sides by the loading. See more details in Carneiro et al. (2003).
14
In this two-step procedure, we use a Limited Information Maximum Likelihood and correct the
variance-covariance matrix of the second stage incorporating the estimated variance-covariance matrix
and gradient of the first stage (Greene, 2000). Note that the two steps presented above can be joined

Measuring Skills and Joint Causality

The implementation of the two-factor model requires additional specificities due to the
way the data has been collected. First, as explained in Section 3, cognitive skills need
to be inferred from grades, which in turn are also affected by non-cognitive skills. As
shown by Carneiro et al. (2003), this is easily accommodated by the model by allowing
a more general factor loading matrix. To see this, let us write the measurement system
(8) in a more compact matrix representation:

T = XT β T + ΛΘ0 + eT

the form of academic test scores, which likely reflect both cognitive and non-cognitive
skills.
The second issue that arises from how the data was collected is the fact that skills are
measured during the school year, therefore some kids may have been already exposed
to the treatment prior to the skill measurement. This may cause a problem of joint
causality, closely related to the effect of schooling at the time on the skill measures
explored in Hansen et al. (2004). In their setting, the simultaneity issue comes from
the fact that highly skilled people might attain higher education levels, but schooling,
in turn, is believed to develop skills. Hence, when in presence of a high-skilled highlyeducated person, econometricians have a hard time disentangling whether the person
is highly-educated because she was highly skilled or she is highly skilled because she
acquired more education. We follow the literature and impose the appropriate structure
to control for the joint causality problem. In particular, the measurement system (9)
needs to be modified to incorporate the probability of being treated at t = 1.

Measurement System

Table 6 displays the estimated parameters of the measurement system (10). The set of
controls XT includes gender, family structure indicators, father’s education attainment,
monthly income per capita and the age stated in months starting from March 1989.15
As expected, cognitive and non-cognitive skills determine school grades as well as noncognitive measures. In fact, our findings suggest that the loadings in Λ are large and

on the other hand, imply that youths with wealthier and more educated parents tent
to be more responsible, have higher levels of self-control and are more positive about
themselves. These results are consistent with those in Cunha et al. (2006) and Heckman
and Masterov (2007). Our estimates also suggest that family composition plays a big
role in fostering desirable personality traits. Individuals with younger siblings and those
who live with both parents tend to be more responsible. Interestingly, those who live
with their mother have substantially higher levels of self-esteem than those who live
only with their father. As with the non-cognitive measures, the cognitive scores are
higher for individuals coming from wealthier and more educated parents, especially
if the mother is present in the family. In addition, the presence of younger (older)
siblings is associated with higher (lower) grades. Another notable finding, which is in
line with Borghans et al. (2008), is that younger students are less responsible and have
less self-control and self-esteem, even within the same year of age.
Using the estimates of equations (10) we are able to recreate the estimated distributions
of initial non-cognitive and cognitive skills across the population evaluated at t = 1.
These distributions are presented in Figures 2a and 2b.

6.1.1

The Bullying Model

We now analyze the determinants and impact of bullying at age 15 (t = 2).17 To do so
we implement the model described by equations (5), (6) and (7). As outcomes, we use
16

Figure 1 presents the variance decomposition of the test scores. It shows that the unobserved
endowments represent a sizable proportion of the variance of the scores, being always more prominent
than the variance captured by the observable controls.
17
As explained in the previous section, latent skills were measured one survey wave before (i.e.,
t = 1).

22

the same measures examined in the context of our reduced form results (see section 4).18
We are particularly interested in assessing the relation between skills, the problematic
behavior and outcomes of interest.
The controls in the binary model describing bullying include age, gender, family structure variables, urban dummy, and father’s education. Moreover, in order to facilitate
identification of the system of equations, we introduced an additional source of variation in the choice or treatment equation. For that, we use a very special institutional
feature of South Korea: the fact that allocation of students to classrooms is random
within school districts (Kang, 2007). Hence, the quality and characteristics of classmates a given student faces are exogenous, and affect each student’s probability of being
bullied in a given classroom (Sarzosa, 2015). In consequence, we introduce two of these
classroom characteristics: the proportion of peers that report being bullies in the class
and the proportion of peers in the classroom that come from a violent family.19
18

Tables A.1 and A.2 in Appendix A present the estimated parameters associated with equation
(4). That is, without the introduction of a treatment variable. It is presented as a benchmark the
see how the outcome variables are effected overall by the observable and unobservable characteristics
of the respondents. These results indicate that non-cognitive skills measured at age 14 are negatively
associated with the likelihood of depression, the incidence of drinking and smoking, the likelihood of
being sick, having mental health issues, or feeling stressed about friends and the economic situation at
age 18. Furthermore, non-cognitive skills have a positive effect on the likelihood of having a positive
perception of life. This is linked with the fact that while non-cognitive skills reduce the likelihood
of depression, cognitive skills increase it. Just like happens with the stress variables. However, the
reduction on the likelihood of depression is much larger than the increase in the likelihood of depression
caused by cognitive skills. We find no effect of cognitive skills on the incidence of drinking alcohol,
feeling sick or having mental health issues, while we find that cognitive skills are highly rewarded in the
selection into college. Finally, our results indicate that both cognitive and non-cognitive skills reduce
the incidence of smoking.
19
We construct a measure of family violence based on the following questions: 1. I always get along
well with brothers or sisters, 2. I frequently see parents verbally abuse each other, 3. I frequently
see one of my parents beat the other one, 4. I am often verbally abused by parents, and 5. I am
often severely beaten by parents. There are five possible answers to each of these five questions that
range from very true to very untrue. We aggregated the answers and considered as students that come
from violent families those who have an aggregate score of family violence above the mean. Then,
we counted how many of these peers each student faced in her classroom as a proportion of the total
number of students in the classroom. This variable is somewhat similar to the classroom proportion of
incarcerated parents variable used as instrument by Eriksen et al. (2014) in that we relate household
emotional trauma with violent behavior in school as in Carrell and Hoekstra (2010). However, we

23

The first variable affects the probability of being bullied it accounts for the fact that
there are more suppliers of violence in the classroom.20 The second variable seeks to
capture the well established fact that youths with behavioral challenges are more likely
to come from violent households (Carlson, 2000; Wolfe et al., 2003). Hence, randomly
formed classrooms in which there are more students that come from violent families are
more prone to witness violent behavior than classrooms with a lower concentration of
students that come from violent families. Again, the incidence of victimization in the
former type of classroom is expected to be higher because there are potentially more
suppliers of violence.
Table 7 shows the results for three different specifications of the bullying equation (7)
whereas Tables 8 and 9 do so for equations (5) and (6) (outcomes). The most salient
finding of Table 7, regardless of the specification, is that while cognitive skills do not
play a role in deterring or motivating the undesired behavior, non-cognitive skills are
a very important determinants of the likelihood of the event. Our findings indicate
that a one standard deviation increase in non-cognitive skills translates into a 4.16
percentage points reduction in the likelihood of being bullied. That is, one standard
deviation increase in non-cognitive skills reduces by 37% the overall probability of being
a victim of bullying. Notably, this significant effect remains unchanged throughout the
three different specifications.21 Table 7 also shows that the availability of suppliers
believe our measure is better in at least two ways. First, it results from reports of actual verbal and
physical violence experienced by the students in their homes as opposed to a proxy of that, which
parental incarceration is. Second, much of the domestic violence may happen within families that do
not go to the extent of having a parent incarcerated. In that way, Eriksen et al. (2014) instrument is
capturing extreme antisocial behavior, leaving out much of the relevant variation in domestic violence.
Finally, it should be noted that unlike Eriksen et al. (2014) these variables (i.e., proportion of bullies
and proportion of peers with violent families) are not crucial for our identification strategy which relies
on the identification of unobserved heterogeneity.
20
Importantly, there is always at least one bully and one victim per classroom in our data.
21
Evidence of the sorting into treatment as a function of unobserved skills can be seen in Figure
3. Those selected as victims had a distribution of non-cognitive skills that lie to the left of that of
non-victims.

24

of violence within each classroom matters. In fact, all else evaluated at the mean,
to go from a classroom with a concentration of bullies in the 25th percentile to one
in the 75th percentile increases the likelihood of being a victim by 2.26 percentage
points. This represents an increase of 20% in the overall probability of being a victim
of bullying. In the same vein, the marginal effect of increasing the concentration of peers
in the classroom that come from violent families is positive and linearly increasing. For
instance, although the marginal effect at the median is roughly zero, it reaches 9.15
percentage points at the classrooms in the 75th percentile of concentration of peers
from violent families. Our finding also indicates that bullying is more prevalent among
boys than among girls. This goes in line with psychological literature (Olweus, 1997;
Wolke et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2004; Faris and Felmlee, 2011).
The results presented in Tables 8 and 9 indicate that skills have differential effects
on the outcomes of interest depending on whether the person was involved in bullying or not.22 These findings suggest that skills not only influence the likelihood of
being involved in bullying, but they also play a role in dealing with the negative consequences after the bullying event has occurred. For instance, cognitive skills tend to
deter drinking and smoking more among victims of bullying than among non-victims.
In the same way, non-cognitive skills reduce stress more among victims than among
non-victims. So regardless of whether bullying has large or small consequences on a
particular dimension—which is the topic of Section 6.2, skill endowments help cope
with these consequences in various ways depending on the outcome.
Although these findings are very informative, they do not inform about the effect of

6.2

The Effect of Bullying

The empirical strategy enables us to identify factual and counterfactual outcome levels
as a function of the latent factors. This allows the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) and the treatment effect on the treated (TT) of being bullied conditional on each level of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Formally, and using the



notation introduced in 5.1, we estimate AT E θN C , θC = E Y1 − Y0 θN C , θC and



T T θN C , θC = E Y1 − Y0 θN C , θC , D = 1 . We also present versions of these parameters after integrating out cognitive and non-cognitive skills.
But before presenting the treatment effect results, we first document how the model
replicates key features of the data. To this end, we use the results described in Section
6.1 to simulate different outcomes and compare them to the actual data.
While the data shows that 11.07% of the sample declares being bullied, our model
predicts that 11.08% of the sample receives the “bullied treatment”. With respect to
the other outcomes of interest, we compare the simulated and actual conditional means:
E [Y0 |D = 0 ] and E [Y1 |D = 1 ]. Table 10 shows these data-model comparisons of the
outcome variables. We see that our model is able to precisely recreate the observed
average outcomes. These results do not only give us confidence about the capability
of the model to fit the data, but also to generate counterfactuals: E [Y1 |D = 0] and
E [Y0 |D = 1 ].

26

6.2.1

ATE and TT of Being Bullied

Table 11 presents the unconditional ATE and TT estimates of being bullied at age 15
on future outcomes (age 18 and older). We document significant effects of victimization
on feeling sick, mental health issues and stress caused by relationships with friends and
parents, as well as in the total stress index. In particular, our results indicate that being
bullied at age 15 causes the incidence of sickness to increase by about 75% three years
later. In the same way, the incidence of mental health issues is increased by half among
the treated due to victimization. Regarding the stress measures, we find that being
bullied increases the stress caused by friendships by 20% of a standard deviation and
the stress caused by the relationship with parents by 15% of a standard deviation. These
findings contrast to the ones reported in the reduced form estimations, which ignore
the endogeneity caused by the selection into treatment. For instance, while we find no
overall effect of bullying on depression, life satisfaction and college attendance, the OLS
estimates found an effect of -13.4%, -4.1 and -4.8 percentage points respectively.
Although we have calculated the overall ATE and TT, we can use our empirical strategy
to inquire about these treatment parameters at different regions of the skills space.
That is, we estimate treatment effects conditional on skill levels, with the intention of
inquiring about subsets of teenager who face impacts even in the absence of impacts in
the overall sample. These results are best presented in standard two-dimensional figures
documenting the association between each skill (x-axis) and the outcome of interest (yaxis). However, for outcomes where the interaction between skills is important, we use
three-dimensional graphs with cognitive and non-cognitive skills in the x and y axes
and the treatment effect in the vertical axis.
Figures 4a to 15c show that there are in fact differential effects of victimization depend27

ing on the level of skills. In particular, these figures show that bullying causes people
with low non-cognitive skills to face higher incidence of depression (Figure 4a), higher
likelihood of feeling physically and mentally ill (Figures 6a and 7a), and higher levels of
stress three years later (Figures 10a, 11a and 15a). Bullying also causes non-cognitive
unskilled people to have less life satisfaction (Figure 8a) and reduce their likelihood of
going to college (Figure 9a). Some of these effects on people with low non-cognitive
skills are sizable. For instance, Figure 4a shows bullying increases the depression symptom index by about one fourth of a standard deviation among teenagers that belong
to the first decile of the non-cognitive skill distribution. Figure 7a shows that victimization has a positive effect of about 0.8 percentage points in the likelihood of having
mental health issues among those teenagers with levels of non-cognitive skills below the
median. In the same vein, Figure 8a shows that bullying reduces likelihood of being
satisfied with life by more than 20 percentage points for the students that belong to
the first decile of the non-cognitive skill distribution.
Evidence from the psychological literature (e.g., Smith et al. (2004)) and the figures
presented in the introduction, also suggest that bullying might affect schooling attainment, particularly by fostering a dislike for school that contributes to absenteeism and
school drop out. By documenting the effect bullying has on college enrollment and stress
caused by school, a measure that proxies a dislike for school and its related activities,
we shed light on this idea.
Figure 9a shows that bullying is an important deterrent in tertiary education enrollment (by age 19). Teenagers that belong to the lower half of the non-cognitive skill
distribution face a negative impact of bullying on college enrollment of the order of
10 to 18 percentage points. This is remarkable specially if we take into account that
non-cognitive skills are not important in determining college enrollment (see Table A.2
28

in the appendix). However, bullying does have an impact among those with low noncognitive skills. Fo them, the the behavioral problem becomes an obstacle to higher
education attainment. This finding also relates to the potential effect of victimization
on the stress caused by school. Figure 10a indicate that although the overall ATE is not
statistically different from zero, the impact of bullying on stress is significant for the
students who posses non-cognitive skills below the median. In fact, the school stress is
half of a standard deviation greater for the bullying victims than for the non-victims in
the first decile of the non-cognitive distribution. All this evidence goes in line with the
claim that bullying is a very harmful mechanism trough which violence deters learning
and schooling achievement, providing a channel through which the findings of Eriksen
et al. (2014) on its effect on GPA materialize.
The effect bullying has on the stress caused by friendships is also greatly affected by
the level of non-cognitive skill endowments. Figure 11a shows that this effect reaches
half of a standard deviation among those in the bottom third of the non-cognitive skills
distribution. Moreover, Figure 11b shows that this effect is exacerbated for cognitive
skilled teenagers. In particular, the effect of bullying on a kid that comes from the first
decile of the non-cognitive skills distribution and from the top decile of the cognitive
skills distribution reaches 70% of a standard deviation in the stress caused by friendship
scale. This contrasts to overall estimated ATE, which is 19.4% of a standard deviation.
Unlike previous outcomes the effect of bullying on smoking is mediated by cognitive
instead of non-cognitive skills. Figure 12b documents significant effects of bullying
on smoking for those who belong to the first decile of the cognitive skill distribution.
For them, bullying increases the likelihood of smoking by about 8.5 percentage points.
Furthermore, Figure 12c shows that among those in the first decile of the cognitive
skill distribution, the effect is greater for those who lack non-cognitive skills. A similar
29

pattern emerges in the analysis of the perception of stress due to economic conditions.
Figure 13c shows that bullying has a significant effect only for those cognitively skilled
who, at the same time, lack non-cognitive skills. For them, the effect is greater than
20% of a standard deviation.
On the other hand, the effect of victimization on the stress caused by the relationship
with the parents is particularly stable across the entire skills space, reaching approximately 15% of a standard deviation. However, Figure 14c shows that the effect is
smaller for those that are skilled in both dimensions. In fact, the effect is no longer
statistically different from zero for this population.
All these results attest to the fact that cognitive and non-cognitive skills not only
affect bullying occurrence, but also, they mediate the extent to which these undesired
behaviors affect subsequent outcomes.

6.3

Bullying and Investments in Skills

We have shown that skills are key determinants of bullying and its consequences. However, the findings are silent about the importance of skill investments. By modifying
the stock of skills, they could reduce bullying occurrence.
To examine this issue, we re-estimated the bullying model (equation (7)), but this time
including control variables proxying for investments. Formally, the model is augmented
to include It , where It is a vector of skills’ investment measures at time t. These
measures include an index of parental control that measures whether the parents know
where the youth is, who he is with and how long he will be there; an index of parental
harmony that measures how much time the kid spends with their parents, whether the
30

child considers she is treated with affection by them, if she believes her parents treat
each other well, and if her parents talk candidly and frequently with her as well as an
index of parental abuse that measure whether the household is a violent setting. We also
include two measures of school characteristics. The school quality measure is an index
that aggregates measures of teacher responsiveness and learning conditions. The teacher
responsiveness measure is based on the perceptions students have of their teacher,
such as whether they think they can talk to their teacher openly and whether they
would like to turn out to be like their teacher when they become adults. The learning
conditions measure is based on the likelihood of students attending top institutions of
higher education after graduating from that particular school, and whether students
believe their school allows them to develop their talents and abilities. Finally, school
environment is measured using information about robbery and criminal activity within
or around the school and the presence of litter and garbage within the school or its
surroundings.23
Our results are shown in the lower panel of Table 12. Column (1) of the table reproduces
the original results just for comparison. Our findings show that the introduction of
investment controls reduces the point estimate of the effect of non-cognitive skills on
the likelihood of being bullied by only 25%. More importantly, however, the results show
that less violence-prone parents and better schools significantly reduce the incidence of
bullying. This suggests that the inertia caused by low skill levels, particularly noncognitive traits, in previous periods on higher likelihoods of being involved in bullying
can be reversed through the modification of tangible scenarios like the improvement of
schools –including teachers– and diminishing aggressive behavior within households.

23

School quality measures are coded in a reverse scale where high numbers mean less school quality.

Conclusions

This paper examines the determinants and consequences of bullying at age 15 on subsequent mental and physical health, risky behaviors, and schooling attainment. We base
our analysis on the estimation of a structural model of endogenous bullying and counterfactual outcomes. That is, we explicitly model selection into the “bullying treatment”.
In this framework, latent cognitive and non-cognitive skills are sources of unobserved
heterogeneity. We estimate the model using longitudinal information from South Korea
(KYP-JHSP).
Our findings show that non-cognitive skills significantly reduce the likelihood of being
a victim of bullying. In particular, one standard deviation increase in non-cognitive
skills reduces the probability of being bullied by 37%. In contrast to these results, we
do not find significant effects of cognitive skills on bullying.
When analyzing the impact of bullying, we document that its victims have higher
incidence of self-reported depression, sickness, mental health issues and stress, as well
as less incidence of life satisfaction and college enrollment three years after the event.
The magnitudes of the estimated treatment effects are by no means small, suggesting
that bullying represents a heavy burden that needs to be carried for a long time.
Finally, consistent with the recent literature on skill formation, our findings suggest that
investing in skills development is essential for any policy intended to fight bullying. We
show that cognitive and non-cognitive skills are mediators that can palliate the effect of
bullying on later outcomes. Consequently, investing in them might not only reduce the
incidence of bullying, as there will be less people prone to be perpetrators and victims,
but also significantly lessen its negative effects.

Note: Variable Oldersiblings corresponds to the number of older siblings the respondent has. Youngsiblings corresponds to the number of younger siblings the respondent
has. Lnmonthincpc corresponds to the natural logarithm of the monthly income per capita. Both Parents takes the value of one if the respondent lives in a biparental
household. OnlyMother takes the value of one if the respondent’s father is absent from the household. FatherEd2yCol takes the value of one if the highest level of
education attained by the respondent’s father was a 2-year college degree. FatherEd4yCol takes the value of one if the highest level of education attained by the
respondent’s father was a 4-year college degree. FatherEducGS takes the value of one if the highest level of education attained by the respondent’s father was graduate
school. Columns headed as 1 collect the coefficients for those who were bullied at age 14. Columns headed as 0 collect the coefficients for those who were not bullied
at age 14. Standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

add controls to the specification presented in Column (1). Namely ParentControl measures whether the parents know where the youth is, who he is
with and how long he will be there, ParentHarmony measures how much
time the respondent spends with their parents, whether she is treated with
affection by them, if her parents treat each other well, and if her parents talk
candidly and frequently to her, ParentAbuse measures whether the household
is a violent setting, SchQuality measures teacher responsiveness and learning
conditions (i.e., how likely are students to attend top institutions of higher
education after graduating from that particular school, and whether students
believe their school allows them to develop their talents and abilities), and
SchEnviron is measured using information about robbery and criminal activity within or around the school and the presence of litter and garbage within
the school or its surroundings. In both specifications we controlled for age in
months, gender, rurality, the number of older and younger siblings the respondent has, the natural logarithm of the monthly income per capita, whether
the respondent lives in a biparental household, whether the respondent’s father is absent from the household., father’s education, the (leave-one-out)
proportion of peers that report being bullies in the respondent’s class. ***

Observations

Note: Note: This Table presents the estimated coefficients of the outcome equations Y = XY β Y + αY,A θA + αY,B θB +
eY . Variable inCollege takes the value of 1 if the respondent attends college by age 19. The Stress variables are
standardized indexes that collect stress symptoms triggered by different sources, namely friends, parents, school and
poverty. Stress:Total aggregates the four triggers of stress. Oldersiblings corresponds to the number of older siblings
the respondent has. Youngsiblings corresponds to the number of younger siblings the respondent has. Lnmonthincpc
corresponds to the natural logarithm of the monthly income per capita. Both Parents takes the value of one if the
respondent lives in a biparental household. OnlyMother takes the value of one if the respondent’s father is absent from
the household. Fathereduc2yColl takes the value of one if the highest level of education attained by the respondent’s
father was a 2-year college degree. Fathereduc4yColl takes the value of one if the highest level of education attained
by the respondent’s father was a 4-year college degree. FathereducGS takes the value of one if the highest level of
education attained by the respondent’s father was graduate school. Columns headed as 1 collect the coefficients for
those who were bullied at age 15. Columns headed as 0 collect the coefficients for those who were not bullied at age
15. Standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
† College attendance is measured at age 19.

Information Used to Construct Non-cognitive score

In the case of locus of control, we added three questions:
1. I have confidence in my own decision
2. I believe that I can deal with my problems by myself
3. I am taking full responsibility of my own life
To create the self-esteem index we added:
1. I think that I have a good character
2. I think that I am a competent person
3. I think that I am a worthy person
4. Sometimes I think that I am a worthless person (the negative of)
5. Sometimes I think that I am a bad person (the negative of)
6. I generally feel that I am a failure in life (the negative of)
7. If I do something wrong, people around me will blame me much (the negative of)
8. If I do something wrong, I will be put to shame by people around me (the negative
of)
Finally we created the irresponsibility index by adding:
1. I jump into exciting things even if I have to take an examination tomorrow
2. I abandon a task once it becomes hard and laborious to do
3. I am apt to enjoy risky activities
