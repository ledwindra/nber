    "abstract": "\n\nJapanese exporters\u2019 choice of invoice currencies is investigated using newly available official Customs declaration data, which records detailed information, including the trading partners\u2019 names, invoicing currency, and product descriptions. The strategic complementarity mechanism, that is, choosing the same invoice currency as others in the same industry or the same destination market, is found among Japanese exporters. We propose the \u201cbroad two-way exporters\u201d whose export destinations and import origins do not necessarily match and the \u201cnarrow two-way exporters\u201d whose export destination and import origins match in the same year. It is found that currency matching for exports and imports is as essential as strategic complementarity for two-way exporters, regardless of dominant currency, producer currency, or local currency invoicing. However, as one of this paper\u2019s novelty, we found evidence that newly entering two-way exporters are less concerned about currency matching. Therefore, the currency matching mechanism for two-way exporters is gradually formed as they continue to survive in international markets.\n\n",
