    "abstract": "\n\nWe test three hypotheses regarding changes in supervisory toughness' and their effects on bank lending.  The data provide modest support for all three hypotheses   that there was an increase in toughness during the credit crunch period (1989-1992), that there was a decline in toughness during the boom period (1993-1998), and that changes in toughness, if they occurred, affected bank lending.  However, all of the measured effects are small, with 1% or less of loans receiving harsher or easier classification, about 3% of banks receiving better or worse CAMEL ratings, and bank lending being changed by 1% or less of assets.\n\n",
