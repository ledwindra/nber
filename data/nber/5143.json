Liquid assets are generally viewed as increasing debt capacity, other things being equal.  This paper focusses on the dark side of liquidity: greater liquidity reduces the ability of borrowers to commit to a specific course of action.  It examines the effects of differences in asset liquidity on debt capacity.  It suggests an alternative theory of financial intermediation and disintermediation.\n\n",
