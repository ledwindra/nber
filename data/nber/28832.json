    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper proposes a new framework for studying the interplay between culture and institutions. We interpret culture as a repertoire, consisting of (cultural) attributes and allowing rich cultural responses to political changes. Combinations of attributes produce cultural configurations, which provide social meaning, coordination and political justification. Our framework has several distinctive features. First, it proposes a \u201csystems approach\u201d to culture: the meaning and function of attributes are determined within the whole configuration and political equilibrium. Second, it emphasizes discontinuous or \u201csaltational\u201d changes in culture\u2014rather than gradual, evolutionary changes\u2014as attributes are reconnected and acquire new meanings in response to evolving circumstances and as outcomes in ongoing \u201ccultural struggles\u201d. Third, our framework puts the spotlight on how fluidly different cultures can respond to conditions, depending on the nature of their attributes and constraints on their connections. Finally, it enriches the study of the co-determination of political, institutional and cultural outcomes.\n\n",
