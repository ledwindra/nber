    "abstract": "\n\nRelatively high birth rates among black adolescents and\nunmarried women as well as inadequate access to medical care are\nconsidered primary reasons why the black neonatal mortality rate\nis almost double that of whites. Using household production\ntheory, this paper examines the determinants of input utilization\nand estimates the impact of utilization on the survival of black\ninfants across large counties in the U.S. in 1977. The results\nindicate that expanding the availability of family planning\nclinics increases the number of teenagers served resulting in a\nlower neonatal mortality rate. Accessibility to abortion services\noperates in a similar manner. Moreover, the use of neonatal\nintensive care, which is strongly related to its availability, is\nan important determinant of newborn survivability whereas the\ninitiation of early prenatal care is not. Overall, the results\nsuggest that lowering the incidence of low weight and preterm\nbirths among blacks by helping women to avoid an unwanted birth,\nmay be the moat cost-effective way of improving black infant\nhealth.\n\n",
