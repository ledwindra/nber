ABSTRACT
We develop and apply a procedure to flexibly estimate intra-national border barriers and intra-regional
trade costs. Bilateral border barriers very significantly depress Canadian inter-provincial trade for
some pairs, though the overall effect is rather small. Bilateral distance imposes much larger interprovincial trade costs. Contiguity between provinces accounts for little. Intra-regional trade cost variation
affects relative bilateral costs and trade flows, and alters comparative statics except in a neutral case
rejected by the data. Consistent trade cost aggregation procedures are developed and applied for groups
of regions and/or sectors.

Introduction

Trade is highly localized, within as well as between nations. Intra-regional and interregional
trade costs are an explanation, but intra-national trade costs and their composition are
poorly understood. A special policy concern is intra-national border barriers, cross-border
trade volume effects that appear after controlling for bilateral distance and contiguity effects.
The small gravity literature on intra-national trade costs has at best estimated an assumed
uniform inter-regional border barrier while neglecting intra-regional costs. This paper develops a new structural gravity method to flexibly estimate inter- and intra-regional trade
costs, including internal border barriers. The coarse aggregation of the prior literature provided degrees of freedom necessary for estimation, alternatively provided here by judicious
use of panel structure. Our measures of intra-national Canadian trade costs have potentially
useful policy implications. Estimated internal border barriers reduced interprovincial manufacturing trade in 2002 by almost 20%, an average concealing much larger reductions for
some provinces and provincial pairs. Our results on variation of intra-provincial trade costs
suggest changes in comparative statics simulation practice with gravity models. Except in a
neutral case that is strongly rejected by the data, accounting for intra-regional cost variation
matters. Our methods and implications apply widely, for example to cross country gravity
modeling.
Inter-regional border effects are flexibly inferred from bilateral trade flows over time
using a two part procedure. One part estimates bilateral trade costs using bilateral fixed
effects along with importer-time and exporter-time fixed effects. The other part estimates
bilateral trade costs using ‘standard gravity’ variables: bilateral distance, contiguity and
international borders. Both parts allow for (but do not find) limited time variation of trade
costs. The difference between the volume deflection inferred from bilateral fixed effects and
the standard gravity variables is dubbed the Unexplained Trade Barrier (UTB), connoting
ignorance about a policy cause of the inter-regional border barrier.1

Intra-regional trade costs are also inferred in the paper with flexible fixed effects, an
improvement on previous efforts, including our own, that relied on the somewhat problematic concept of internal distance. Estimated intra-regional costs vary substantially across
regions. Internal distribution intuitively should be part of full bilateral costs, suggesting
that intra-regional and inter-regional trade costs are related in a full bilateral cost function.
In a neutral special case, intra-regional trade costs are not identified separately from region
fixed effects, bilateral trade is independent of variation of intra-regional trade costs and the
common practice of suppressing intra-regional trade costs is harmless for comparative statics. Neutrality is resoundingly rejected at the 0.01% level of significance in a hypothesis
test derived from our analysis.2 Intra-regional trade costs matter. Their relationship to
inter-regional and international trade costs deserves attention in future research.
Aggregation of inter-regional trade costs is important for many purposes, and consistent
aggregation is important because such costs vary widely across partners. Consistent aggregators across partner regions are defined as the uniform trade cost that preserves the same
aggregate volume (Anderson and Neary (2005)) for each region, similarly aggregating across
origin regions for national inter-regional trade. We use these as convenient summary indexes below. The consistent indexes differ substantially and consequentially from atheoretic
trade-weighted indexes, as we demonstrate.
Estimates of inter-provincial and intra-provincial trade costs (along with international
trade costs) are inferred by applying the structural gravity model to high quality provincial
trade flow data3 over the period 1997-2007. The discussion of results concentrates on estimates from aggregate manufacturing bilateral trade for simplicity, illustrating the power of
the U.S. to construct ‘home bias’ effects interpreted as taste parameters. The residual method is loosely
related to ours, while the ‘home bias’ applies to all the state partners of the home state, less flexibly than
our UTB specification. As is well known, home bias in tastes is indistinguishable from a uniform border
barrier. Large variation of estimated flexible border effects suggests that home bias in tastes is not adequate
as an interpretation.
2
Neutrality implies that bilateral trade costs are not identified separately from multilateral resistances,
so rejection also implies identification.
3
The paucity of research on intra-national trade costs is partly due to deficient data. To our knowledge,
except for Canada, data on bilateral shipments within nations does not record true origin-destination trade.

the methods. The results are qualitatively similar to those for the 19 goods and 9 services
sectors briefly discussed.4 Estimates are quite precise. Analysis of residuals and sensitivity
experiments support our baseline specification.
Bilateral distance effects account for most of the variation in the estimated bilateral fixed
effects (the correlation coefficient is 0.95), but UTBs directly account for a 19.7% overall
reduction in 2002 interprovincial manufacturing trade, worth CAD 20.3 billion. Volume
effects converted to tariff equivalents using an elasticity of substitution equal to 5 yield an
implied ‘tariff’ equivalent of 5.6%. This relatively low average conceals some much larger
average provincial border costs (notably for Quebec and some remote provinces) that may
merit policy concern. Still more variation is observed bilaterally (e.g. Quebec with its
provincial partners).
Constructed Trade Bias (CTB), defined as the ratio of predicted to hypothetical frictionless trade flows for each bilateral pair, measures the general equilibrium effects of all
bilateral trade costs on volume.5 The ratio of interregional to intra-regional CTB is Constructed Interregional Bias (CIB), a measure of interregional volume deflection. Typically,
CTB is greater than one due to the common deflection of trade away from the international
border, while CIB is generally less than one, usually much less. A negative power transform
of the CIB ratio is equal to the ratio of sellers’ incidence on interregional sales to sellers’
incidence on intra-regional sales. Relative sellers’ incidence in 2002 manufacturing (consistently aggregated across provincial partners) ranges from 13.2 for Yukon Territory down to
1.2 for Ontario based on estimated CIBs raised to the power 1/(1 − σ) with elasticity of
substitution σ = 5. Variation is even greater across provincial partners for each exporter.
Notably, over the period 1997 to 2007, despite our finding of constant bilateral trade

Details are available on request, but we see the sectoral estimates as an input to investigate the relationship between border barriers and institutional and infrastructure variables, or for general equilibrium
comparative statics. Sectoral disaggregation is generally important because previous work (Anderson and
Yotov (2010)) has shown that estimates of trade costs from aggregate data are biased downward, a concern
especially acute for estimating intra-national trade costs.

Intra-regional CTB is the Constructed Home Bias (CHB) proposed by Anderson and Yotov (2010), and

costs, Canada’s provinces are generally becoming more integrated with both the world,
intra-regional CTB is generally falling; and with each other, CIB is generally rising. The
increasing integration is due to secular changes in the incidence of trade costs that are in
turn due to the changing location of production and expenditure. (See Anderson and Yotov,
2010, for discussion of the effect of changes in location of production and expenditure on
incidence.)
The Unexplained moniker for UTBs is a call for explanation, in the spirit of Head and
Mayer (2013) who call gravity “trade costs” dark in a cosmological metaphor.6 UTBs can
be related in future work to information on province-sector regulatory and other barriers
combined with infrastructure. At least some of the darkness may be illuminated. Meanwhile, our intra-national trade cost and relative incidence measures for Canada may suggest
directions of policy reform to raise efficiency and/or reduce regional inequality.
This is the first study to infer and quantify intra-provincial and inter-provincial trade costs
for each province and each provincial pair in Canada. A strand of the existing literature
evaluates the impact of regional borders on trade flows within other economies, with methods
that differ from ours in details of the gravity model approach and level of aggregation.7 Our
6
Resistance is inferred from deflection of observed trade from a theoretical benchmark, just as cosmology
infers dark energy from the accelerating expansion of the universe and dark matter from the spin of galaxies
inexplicable from their observed mass. Extending the metaphor, dark energy is associated with the failure
of the distance elasticity of trade to fall despite technological improvements and dark matter is associated
with the trade-reducing effect of borders. Specific to the theme of this paper, more shadow falls because the
intra-regional costs are themselves aggregates across trade costs between smaller sub-regions. Dropping the
metaphor, “costs” in the usage of this paper (and much of the literature) may be resistance to inter-regional
and international trade due to “buy local” bias of buyers.

that reviews home bias estimates is available by request. This literature has mainly adopted two methods
of estimating internal trade barriers: using the gravity model with a uniform effect of intra-regional relative
to inter-regional trade costs or using proxies for inter-regional trade borders. A more distantly related literature infers trade costs from price differences (e.g., Engel and Rogers (1996)) at a much more disaggregated
level. As with trade flows, distance and borders account well for price differences. Very highly detailed price
comparisons often imply very large intra-national price gaps in developing countries (Atkin and Donaldson
(2013)); much less so in developed countries. The price comparison method is limited in coverage due to the
difficulty of matching prices for truly comparable items across locations. Also, the price comparison method

4

average estimates of internal border barriers are the smallest in the literature (though some
provincial averages are much larger). The difference in methods is an explanation, but it
could also reflect more complete Canadian integration. Tombe and Winter (2013) share our
focus on intra-national Canadian trade costs but differ in their methods. They flexibly infer
pure inter-regional trade costs from observed bilateral trade relative to internal trade using
the “tetrads” approach of Head and Mayer (2000). They parametrically remove the effect of
bilateral distance from the tetrads pairwise relative costs. By construction tetrads includes
random elements excluded from our fitted pairwise fixed effects estimator. Our fixed effects
estimates systematically differ significantly from their tetrads counterparts, though the two
are highly correlated. More importantly, we estimate intra-regional trade costs that are
necessarily normalized in the Tombe and Winter (2013) approach. Our work is also related
to the literature on the international border barrier to Canada’s trade: McCallum (1995),
Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) to name a few.8
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the theoretical foundation
and introduces the Constructed Trade Bias index. Section 3 describes our data and develops
the econometric specification. Section 4 presents our main findings and robustness checks.
Section 5 concludes.

Theoretical Foundation

A review of structural gravity theory (Anderson and van Wincoop (2003, 2004)) sets the
stage for extensions. Next, we define Constructed Trade Bias (CTB), the generator of
a family of Constructed Bias indexes with two novel ones useful for understanding intracan only find trade costs that show up in prices, in contrast to inference from trade flows that includes all
non-price costs borne by buyers (travel time, contracting costs, etc.). Inference from trade flows provides
complementary evidence on trade costs for these reasons.
8
Apart from gravity, a number of case studies have also examined the economic costs of internal trade
barriers in Canada. Grady and Macmillan (2007) provide a descriptive overview of the academic and nonacademic literature on barriers to internal trade in Canada and also evaluate the economic costs brought
about these impediments to trade. Beaulieu et al. (2003) describe in great detail the various trade policies
and reforms initiated by the Canadian government in order to liberalize inter-provincial trade.

national trade.9 Then we analyze bilateral trade costs as a combination of intra-regional
and pure interregional costs, developing implications for comparative statics and econometric
identification. Finally, consistent aggregation of bilateral trade costs is developed.
The structural gravity model assumes identical preferences or technology across countries
for national varieties of goods or services differentiated by place of origin for every good or
service category k, represented by a globally common Constant Elasticity of Substitution
(CES) sub-utility or production function.10 Use of the market clearing condition for each
origin’s shipments and each destination’s budget constraint yields the structural form:

where Xijk denotes the value of shipments at destination prices from region of origin i to
region of destination j in goods or services of class k. Here and henceforth in the paper, the
order of double subscripts denotes origin to destination. Ejk is the expenditure at destination
j on goods or services in k from all origins. Yik denotes the sales of goods or services k at
destination prices from i to all destinations, while Y k is the total output, at delivered prices,
of goods or services k. tkij ≥ 1 denotes the variable trade cost factor on shipments of goods
or services from i to j in class k, and σk is the elasticity of substitution across goods or
services of class k. Pjk is the inward multilateral resistance (IMR), and also the CES price
index of the demand system. Πki is the outward multilateral resistance (OMR), which from
(2) aggregates i’s outward trade costs relative to destination price indexes. Multilateral

resistance is a general distributional equilibrium concept, since {Πki , Pjk } solve equations
(2)-(3) for given {Yik , Ejk }.
The right hand side of (1) comprises two parts, the frictionless value of trade Ejk Yik /Y k
and the distortion to that trade induced by trade costs (tkij /Πki Pjk )1−σk directly with tkij and
indirectly with Πki Pjk . Anderson and Yotov (2010) note that Pjk and Πki are respectively
the buyers’ and sellers’ overall incidence of trade costs to their counter-parties worldwide.
Incidence here means just what it does in the first course in economics: the proportion of the
trade cost factor tkij paid by the buyer and seller respectively. The difference is that purchase
and sales are aggregated across bilateral links, such that conceptually it is as if each seller’s
global sales travel to a hypothetical world market with equilibrium world price equal to 1.
The seller receives 1/Πki , hence pays incidence factor Πki . Each buyer makes purchases from
all origins on the world market, paying incidence Pjk to bring them to destination j. These
overall incidence measures further imply bilateral incidence: tkij /Pjk is seller i’s incidence of
trade costs on sales to destination j for good k, and tkij /Πki is buyer j’s incidence of trade
costs on purchase from origin i for good k. tkij /Πki Pjk is interpreted as either bilateral buyer’s
incidence, (tkij /Πki )/Pjk relative to overall buyers’ incidence, or bilateral sellers’ incidence
(tkij /Pjk )/Πki relative to overall sellers’ incidence.

2.1

Constructed Trade Bias

Constructed Trade Bias is defined as the ratio of the econometrically predicted trade flow
bijk to the hypothetical frictionless trade flow between origin i and destination j for goods
X
or services of class k. Rearranging the econometrically estimated version of equation (1),
Constructed Trade Bias is given by:
X̂ijk
CT Bijk ≡ k k k =
Yi Ej /Y

t̂kij
Π̂ki P̂jk

!1−σk
.

(4)

In the hypothetical frictionless equilibrium CT Bijk = 1, i’s share of total expenditure by each
destination j, Xijk /Ejk , is equal to Yik /Y k , i’s share of world shipments in each sector k. This
would be the pattern in a completely homogenized world. “Frictionless” and “trade costs”
are used here for simplicity and clarity, but the model can also reflect local differences in
tastes that shift demand just as trade costs do, suggesting “resistance” rather than costs.
The second equation in (4) gives the structural gravity interpretation of CTB, the 1 − σk
power transform of the ratio of predicted bilateral trade costs to the product of outward
multilateral resistance at i and the inward multilateral resistance at j. (The Constructed
Home Bias index of Anderson and Yotov (2010) is the special case CT Bijk ; i = j home bias
of i’s internal trade.)
Five properties of CTB are appealing. First, CTB is independent of the normalization
needed to solve system (2)-(3) for the multilateral resistances.11 Second, CTB is independent
of the elasticity of substitution σk , because it is constructed using the inferred (estimated)
volume effects that are due to 1 − σk power transforms of the tkij ’s, the Πk ’s and the P k ’s.
Third, CTB can be consistently aggregated to yield a family of useful general equilibrium
trade costs indexes at the country and at the regional level. One is developed below to
measure aggregate inter-regional trade bias facing sellers.12 Fourth, because it measures the
proportional displacement of volume from the observable frictionless benchmark, CTB is
comparable across sectors and time as well as across provinces and countries.13 Fifth, CTB
infers central tendency out of the random errors that beset notoriously mis-measured bilateral
trade flow data. Specifically, the ratio of observed bilateral trade to hypothetical frictionless
trade is an observation of CTB while our estimated CTB is its conditional expectation. CTB
shares the good fit properties of gravity models, so this distinction is important.
11

Note that (2)-(3) solves for {Πki , Pjk } only up to a scalar. If {Π0i , Pj0 } is a solution then so is {λΠ0i , Pj0 /λ}.
12
Other CTB aggregates have been defined and reported in Anderson and Yotov (2010) and Anderson,
Milot and Yotov (2013).
13
In contrast, because gravity can only identify relative bilateral trade costs, constructed trade costs
depend on normalizations by unobservable levels of bilateral cost that in principle vary across sectors and
time, vitiating comparability along these dimensions. The same issue arises with the multilateral trade cost
(multilateral resistance) measures that can be inferred from structural gravity.

8

Intra-provincial and inter-provincial trade both are raised relative to their frictionless
benchmark values by large international trade costs, but intra-provincial trade is increased by
much more. To focus on internal barriers to trade, a useful and natural index is Constructed
Interregional Bias (CIB):

In a frictionless world, CIBijk = 1 = CT Bhl
, ∀h, i, j, k, l. The left hand side of equation (5)

gives the relative reduction of inter-provincial trade due to trade costs in the world system.
The middle equation gives CIB as the 1 − σk power transform of seller i’s incidence on sales
to j relative to i’s internal sales. The rightmost equation breaks the ratio into the 1 − σk
power transforms of two components. The numerator component is the interprovincial part
of the total shipment cost from i to j, tkij /tkii . The denominator component is Pjk /Pik , the
additional buyer’s incidence facing seller i when selling to destination j.

2.2

Modeling Full Bilateral Costs

Trade costs tkij are arbitrary in the theory above, while compromises with observability,
econometric identifiability and parsimony dictate restrictions in the empirical literature.14
The usual restrictions are theoretically consequential, motivating the alternative restrictions
used in this paper described in Section 3.1.
Gravity models treat bilateral trade costs as if the origin volume melted en route to
destination like an iceberg melting, i.e. the loss is in proportion to volume.15 Iceberg trade
costs customarily are modeled as multiplicative functions of component factors that affect
resistance to trade, preserving the proportionality feature in components. Thus they are
14

It is technically possible to calculate {tkij , Πki , Pjk } from (1)-(3). Since bilateral trade data, and production
data are rife with measurement error, this ‘zero degrees of freedom econometrics’ has no inferential validity.
Restrictions on the trade costs specification generate the degrees of freedom that permit inference.
15
An enormously useful simplification, the iceberg assumption implies separability of the distribution of
goods from the production and consumption of goods.

9

log-linear functions of observable trade cost components (tariffs) or proxies (distance).16
The overall good fit of estimated gravity equations suggests that this specification is fairly
accurate, but the specification cannot pick up idiosyncratic barriers to interregional trade
such as unobservable responses to regulatory and informal discriminatory ‘buy local’ barriers.
To pick up unobservable idiosyncratic barriers, a generalization of the standard gravity
specification is feasible in panel data settings. The generalization allows for trade cost
components that are time invariant, such as geographic proxies, and time varying components
that are suitably restricted, such as before and after a policy reform (joining a Free Trade
Agreement, harmonizing regulations) or infrastructure improvement (highway link, container
port). The time-invariant components can be estimated with either bilateral fixed effects
(identified off the time variation of the panel) or with the log-linear function of geographic
proxies, which is standard in the gravity literature. The difference between the fixed effects
and gravity variables estimates is defined below as the Unexplained Trade Barrier. UTB
provides important clues to policy analysis (it may indicate hidden regulatory or other border
barriers) and to future research (its pattern suggests possible explanations of UTB). At a
minimum, the fixed effects comparison gives a measure of how well the standard parsimonious
gravity treatment of trade costs does.
The empirical literature usually sets intra-regional trade costs to zero, when treated
explicitly at all. Zero intra-regional trade costs imply tkii = 1, ∀i. One normalization in some
form (e.g., set the smallest region’s intra-regional trade cost factor to 1) is required in each
sector k because relative trade costs only can be inferred from system (1)-(3).17 At issue is
the consequential further restriction of all intra-regional trade costs.
Allowing for general intra-regional trade costs is required for accurate evaluation of policy
reforms. Changes in any of the bilateral trade costs tkij , tkii and tkjj generate changes in all the
16

Generalized iceberg melting can include fixed costs and non-proportional dependence on volume.
A uniform t > 1 implies that bilateral trade is equal to its frictionless benchmark everywhere, and
furthermore a uniform increase λ > 1 applied to an initial set of tkij s will result in no change in the observed
trade pattern. This theoretical property of (1)-(3) means that level of estimated trade costs is meaningless;
they must be normalized by some convenient benchmark bilateral trade cost. It is natural to use the smallest
such cost, normally the smallest intra-regional trade cost.
17

10

multilateral resistances, locally evaluated with the comparative static derivatives of system
(1)-(3) that depend on all the trade costs. Estimation of tkij , i 6= j, in contrast, is unbiased
regardless of intra-regional trade costs because the elegant simplicity of structural gravity in
(1) implies that third party effects such as tkii on trade between i and j are captured by (Πki
and Pjk ), and controlled with origin and destination region fixed effects.
The comparative statics of (2)-(3) for given Es and Y s (conditional general equilibrium)
are invariant to intra-regional trade costs in a special neutral case that restricts the combination of intra-regional and inter-regional costs in the full origin-destination bilateral trade
cost. Econometrically, the neutral case implies that the level of bilateral cost cannot be
identified in gravity regressions separately from multilateral resistance. The neutral case
analysis is developed here and a hypothesis test based on it is reported below. Neutrality is
rejected at the 0.01% level of significance in the results for the Canadian case.
Bilateral trade costs can generally be modeled as a degree one homogeneous increasing
and concave function tij = g(rij , rii , rjj ) of three components, the resource costs (rhl , ∀h, l)
of delivering one unit of distribution activity in each of the origin, destination and transit
between them. Homogeneity of degree one is consistent with the iceberg trade cost context
that suppresses indivisibilities. Concavity is implied by cost-minimizing behavior. Neutrality
ρ1 ρ2 ρ3
obtains whenever g(·) can be factored into multiplicative components rij
rii rjj , a Cobb-

Douglas structure under the homogeneity restriction ρ1 + ρ2 + ρ3 = 1. The origin and
ρ3
−ρ3
destination effects riiρ2 , rjj
form part of the composite multilateral resistances rii−ρ2 Πi , rjj
Pj

that solve (2)-(3). The composite terms are invariant to the intra-regional trade costs.
In the econometric specification of bilateral trade costs below, the composite multilateral
resistance terms are controlled for with origin and destination fixed effects and the bilateral
cost identified is the pure inter-regional cost.
More general specifications violate neutrality. For example, specialize the bilateral trade
cost function g(·) by imposing separability with respect to the partition between intraregional and inter-regional costs: g(·) = c[rij , f (rii , rjj )] where f (·) is a degree one homoge-

11

neous concave increasing function of the intra-regional trade costs. By homogeneity of degree
one, c(·) = f (·)c[rij /f (·), 1]. The neutral case for intra-regional costs is the Cobb-Douglas
specification:
1−ω
, ω ∈ [0, 1], i 6= j.
f (rii , rjj ) = riiω rjj

(6)

Neutrality does not obtain unless c[rij , f (·)] = f c[rij /f (rii , rjj )] is further restricted to the
µ 1−µ
Cobb-Douglas function rij
f , hence µ = ρ1 , (1 − µ)ω = ρ2 , (1 − µ)(1 − ω) = ρ3 . Without
1−ω
the further restriction c[rij /riiω rjj
, 1] remains a function of the origin and destination intra-

regional resistances, so factorization using (6) does not provide invariance of the composite
multilateral resistances solved from (2)-(3) to the size of intra-regional trade costs. Departing
from the Cobb-Douglas (6) for intra-regional costs or departing from separability provide
still more avenues for violating neutrality.18
Specification (6) is somewhat plausible in tackling local distribution costs at either end
onto a pure interregional cost, generalizing the intuitive notion that multiplicative internal
distribution margins apply in the destination to all goods, local and imported. But (6) is
too restrictive to apply uncritically, especially when intra-regional trade costs are a primary
concern. Neutrality fails a hypothesis test on Canadian data. Future applications to other
data should include tests for local distribution neutrality.

2.3

Consistent Aggregation of Trade Bias and Trade Costs

Aggregation of volume concepts such as CTBs and trade cost concepts such as tij or tij /tii is
useful for many purposes. Aggregation procedures are set out here that are consistent with
maintaining a constant aggregate volume of trade given the theoretical model. Aggregation
over regions is the focus, but similar principles apply to consistent aggregates over sectors.
The aggregate (export) trade volume from origin i to some subset of destinations C(i) =

The Cobb-Douglas form of g(·) is sufficient for neutrality and it appears to be nearly necessary except
for trivial cases such as f = 1.

C(i) excludes internal trade, and can also exclude other bilateral trade depending on what

The CT BC(i) concept is illustrated by Canadian province i’s interprovincial exports, but
can be applied to any arbitrary set of regions’ interregional exports or, mutatis mutandis, to
imports rather than exports. (In the import case, the expenditure share weights are replaced
by sales share weights.) For example, the concept can usefully be applied to preferential trade
arrangements.
The aggregate CIB for region i is defined as CIBC(i) ≡ CT BC(i) /CT Bii . CIBC(i) measures the average amount by which trade costs directly and indirectly reduce interregional
volume relative to intra-regional volume for region i with its partners in C. The aggregate
P
CIB for set C is given by CIBC /[ i CT Bii Ei /EC ].
19

The Constructed Foreign Bias (CFB) and the Constructed Domestic Bias (CDB) indexes of Anderson
et al. (2013) are focused on aggregation across destinations to measure outward resistance to trade.

13

Turning to relative cost counterparts to the aggregate volume concepts, power transforms
of the CIBs give relative sellers’ incidence measures, just as in equation (5). This follows
P
because CT BC(i) = j∈C(i) (tij /Pj )1−σ Ej /EC(i) = Π1−σ
C(i) where the first equation follows by
substituting (1) into (4) and (8), and the second equation formalizes the interpretation of
the result by defining the sellers’ incidence of i on sales to C(i). Π1−σ
C(i) is the expenditure
weighted average of the volume effect of the bilateral sellers’ incidences (tij /Pj )1−σ . Then
the region i’s sellers’ incidence on sales to C(i) relative to local sales is given by:
1/(1−σ)
ΠC(i)
= CIBC(i)
,
Πii

(10)

where Πii ≡ tii /Pi . The relative incidence measure (10) is the economic driver of the volume
response of the sellers, CIBC(i) , representing how the system of bilateral trade costs directly
and indirectly determines seller behavior.
The direct relative trade costs {tij /tii , j ∈ C(i)} also have a useful aggregate. The subset
of bilateral trade costs tij is to be aggregated consistently so as to preserve the aggregate
export volume from i to destinations j in the subset j ∈ C(i), j 6= i.20 For small subsets
(where smallness is defined in terms of trade volume shares), it is approximately accurate
and practically quite useful to ignore the effect of changes in tij , j ∈ C(i) on the multilateral
resistances Πi , Pj . Then, for each origin i the volume equivalent uniform bilateral trade cost
index bC(i) is implicitly defined by

the bilateral sellers’ incidence for each sale j ∈ C(i), the weights Ej / j∈C(i) Ej are the
frictionless equilibrium shares of i’s trade to j; and the equation requires that the average

uniform bilateral trade cost. bC(i) has an explicit solution from equation (12):

The direct relative trade cost for region i exporting to its partners in C(i) is bC(i) /tii .21
Finally, it is useful to aggregate components of trade costs, such as UTBs. The Unexplained Trade Barrier has a tax equivalent equal to the inferred proportional tax rate that
equates the bilateral trade cost estimated using bilateral fixed effects with the same bilateral
trade cost estimated using the standard gravity variables (with details in Section 3.1). The
index of the bilateral UTB tax equivalents is formed from the ratio of bC(i) calculated with
E
bilateral fixed effects to bC(i) calculated with gravity variables: bFC(i)

the weights wj in (13) differ between the bilateral fixed effects and gravity variables estimates, not just the estimated bilateral trade costs. The difference is due to the difference in

21

It is also possible to construct an aggregate direct relative trade cost bC /tCC . The overall uniform
interregional trade cost bC is defined by extension of the operations of (10) and (11). Summing over i on
both sides of (12) after weighting by expenditure shares and implicitly solving for the common bC yields:

Here ΠC is the overall sellers’ incidence of interprovincial trade costs in C. bC is the common interprovincial

constructed from the expenditure weighted volume effects of sellers’ incidence on internal sales.

Index (13) is partial equilibrium in the sense that multilateral resistances of seller i and
buyers j ∈ C(i) are held constant in switching to the uniform equivalent cost factor bC(i) . In
comparing two situations, as with the fixed effects and gravity variables estimators where the
latter suppress the inter-regional border effect, the index includes general equilibrium effects
on the multilateral resistances. The difference this makes is illustrated below by constructing
a fully partial equilibrium index where the weights in the two calculations of bC(i) remain
the same.

Empirical Foundation

This section details the econometric specification and procedures used to infer the volume
displacement and trade cost indexes describing inter-provincial trade in Canada. An extension of now standard gravity methods that exploits the panel nature of the data permits
measurement of potential unobservable barriers at provincial borders — Unexplained Trade
Barriers (UTBs). The section closes with a brief description of our data, supplemented by a
detailed Data Appendix.

3.1

Econometric Specification

The econometric approach produces Constructed Trade Biases and bilateral trade costs for
each pair of regions and each year in the sample directly (except where necessary the sectoral
index k is suppressed):
xij,t Yt
= exp[α0 Tij,t + γij + ηi,t + θj,t ] + ij,t .
Yi,t Ej,t

(15)

The dependent variable is size-adjusted trade. Thus, CTB is the predicted values from (15).
The last two terms in the square brackets of (15) account for the structural multilateral
resistances. Specifically, ηi,t denotes the set of time-varying source-country dummies that
16

control for the unobservable outward multilateral resistances and any other time varying
source country factors, and θj,t encompasses the time varying destination country dummy
variables that account for the inward multilateral resistances and any other destination
country factors. The first two terms on the right hand side of equation (15) account for
bilateral trade costs.
Bilateral trade costs in (15) are decomposed into time-dependent and time-invariant
components:

tFij,tE

1−σ

= exp[α0 Tij,t + γij ].

(16)

Here, tFij,tE denotes bilateral trade costs between regions i and j at time t, and the superscript
F E captures the fact that we use the full set of pair-fixed effects, γij , to account for the
time invariant portion of trade costs. In addition to absorbing the vector of time-invariant
covariates that are used standardly in the gravity literature (e.g. distance), the pair-fixed
effects will control for any other time-invariant trade costs components that are unobservable
to researchers and to policy makers.22
The first term in (16), Tij,t , is a vector of time-varying gravity variables intended to
capture changes in bilateral trade costs over time. The changes are restricted to sensibly
pick up suspected effects.23 The evolution of internal trade costs in Canada is captured
by two time-varying covariates. IN T RAP R Tij,t = IN T RAP Rij × Tt is the interaction
between a dummy variable for intra-provincial trade IN T RAP Rij and a time trend Tt . The
estimated coefficient of IN T RAP R Tij,t would capture any changes in intra-provincial trade
costs over the period of investigation. Similarly, IN T ERP R Tij,t = IN T ERP Rij × Tt is the
22

Using bilateral fixed effects in the gravity equation is not new. For example, Baier and Bergstrand (2007)
use pair fixed-effects to successfully account for potential endogeneity of FTAs. However, to the best of our
knowledge, ours is the first paper to use bilateral pair fixed effects to properly measure bilateral trade costs.
More importantly, as emphasized below, we are the first to construct and to study the difference between
the trade costs from the fixed effects specification, and the trade costs from a standard specification with
gravity variables.
23
The usual components of Tij,t , when the gravity model is applied to international trade data, control for
tariffs, for the presence of free trade agreements (FTAs), monetary unions (MUs), World Trade Organization
(WTO) membership, etc. Given the specifics of our sample, we cannot include any of these variables.

17

interaction of IN T ERP Rij , a dummy variable for inter-provincial trade with a time trend,
and its estimated coefficient has a similar interpretation. By construction, the estimated
coefficients of IN T ERP R Tij,t and IN T RAP R Tij,t should be interpreted as deviations
of internal (intra-provincial or inter-provincial) Canadian trade costs from the changes in
international trade costs over time.
With these restrictions, specification (15) becomes:
xij,t Yt
= exp[α1 IN T ERP R Tij,t + α2 IN T RAP R Tij,t + γij + ηi,t + θj,t ] + ij,t .
Yi,t Ej,t

(17)

The benefit of using pair-fixed effects in specification (17) is that these fixed effects control
for all possible time-invariant bilateral trade costs. The estimates of the bilateral trade costs
from (17) are in principle directly comparable to estimates of trade costs that are obtained
from a specification with standard gravity variables. We exploit the comparability below to
construct the Unexplained Trade Barrier (UTB) estimate as the difference between the two.
In practice, however, collinearity requires restrictions on the pair fixed effects estimator.
Intra-regional pair fixed effects are dropped in the restricted pair fixed effects approach
while the specification with gravity variables includes intra-regional fixed effects. Consistent
comparison between the two specifications that form the UTB estimates requires developing
the implications.
Perfect collinearity requires restrictions on the pair-fixed effects from specification (17).24
For clarity, temporarily suppress the time varying part of specification (17). Perfect collinearity arises because the sum of the dummy variable vectors corresponding to the full set of
γij s is equal to the sum of dummy variable vectors corresponding to the full set of province
dummies, either as exporter or importer. We solve the collinearity problem by imposing two
24

Another collinearity problem, which is standard in gravity estimations, arises because the sum of the
province/territory dummy variable vectors corresponding to origin and destination regions respectively are
equal to each other in each period. This problem is solved by dropping one province as destination in each
year, meaning that the remaining province origin and destination coefficients for that period are interpreted
as relative to the coefficient of the dropped province. To use a constant term, the same province is also
dropped once as an origin.

18

restrictions that are standardly used in the trade literature and that allow us to obtain and
to interpret meaningfully a set of bilateral interprovincial trade costs for each possible pair
in our sample.
First, we scale the time-invariant bilateral trade costs so that internal trade costs are
suppressed: interprovincial trade costs are measured relative to intra-provincial costs. Effectively, we generate the γij estimates from a theoretical original set of Γij s by imposing
γij = Γij − (Γii + Γjj )/2 ⇒ γii = γjj = 0. The estimated bilateral fixed effects for interprovincial trade are thus understood as relative to an index of intra-provincial trade costs:
exp(γij ) = exp[Γij − (Γii + Γjj )/2] = [tij /(tii tjj )1/2 ]1−σ , where the denominator is a geometric
mean of intra-provincial trade costs. The second restriction is to impose symmetry on the
interprovincial fixed effects: γij = γji ; ∀i, j ∈ CA.25 Under symmetry [tij /(tii tjj )1/2 ]1−σ is the
volume effect of the geometric mean of the two interprovincial relative trade cost factors.
Under the restrictions, the inter-provincial volume effects of trade costs from specification
(16) are:
t̂Fij,tE

1−σ

= [t̂ij /(t̂ii t̂jj )1/2 ]1−σ = eΓ̂ij /e(Γ̂ii +Γ̂jj )/2 = eγ̂ij ,

(18)

where the last equality reflects the estimated value. Given separately obtained estimates
of the intra-regional trade costs, the full interregional volume effect t̂1−σ
= exp(Γ̂ij ) can be
ij

1−σ
= eγ̂ij is interpreted as trade volume displacement due to
obtained. Alternatively, t̂Fij,tE
inter-regional (interprovincial) trade costs relative to (the geometric mean of) intra-regional
trade costs. The corresponding tariff equivalent index is:


τ̂ijF E = eγ̂ij /(1−σ̂) − 1 × 100,

(19)

where, σ̂ is the trade elasticity of substitution. Following the existing literature, in our
25

In robustness checks, allowing for asymmetry of pairwise fixed effects has little effect on results. The
baseline symmetry restriction is imposed for comparability with the necessarily symmetric gravity variables
specification. In contrast we do not impose any restrictions on trade costs between the Canadian regions, the
U.S. and the rest of the world. This helps control for complications and biases associated with measuring
trade costs among these aggregate regions. In the Supplementary Appendix, we demonstrate that our
internal trade costs estimates are robust to the exclusion of the U.S. and the rest of the world in our sample.

19

empirical analysis we choose the standard value for the elasticity of substitution σ̂ = 5.26
Fixed effects specification (18) is closely related in theory to the tetrads measure proposed
by Head and Mayer (2000) and used since by others. Using only observables, they propose
p
Xij Xji /Xii Xjj as representing [t̂ij /(t̂ii t̂jj )1/2 ]1−σ . The difference with our bilateral fixed
effects approach in practice is that our estimated γ̂ij is fitted, controlling for random errors,
whereas the tetrads ‘estimate’ includes the error terms. Moreover, specification (17) controls
for origin- and destination-time effects in the random errors. Tests below indicate systematic
deviations of tetrads from the pairwise fixed effects estimator.
The Unexplained Trade Barrier (UTB) is defined as the difference between the logarithm
of the volume effect of bilateral trade costs constructed from the specification with fixed
1−σ
, and the corresponding trade costs obtained from a specification where
effects, tFij,tE
the pair-fixed effects γij from specification (16) are replaced with gravity variables such as
distance and contiguity:

(20)

On the right hand side, the interregional cost estimated from gravity variables is measured
relative to the geometric mean intra-regional cost, to make it consistent with the inferred
measure from bilateral fixed effects under the dropped variable specification above. An important property of the UTB estimator (20) is that it is independent of the scaling by internal
trade costs. Rewrite the fixed effects estimate ln(t̂Fij,tE )1−σ as γ̂ij = Γ̂ij − (Γ̂ii + Γ̂jj )/2. Then
with consistent estimation of intra-regional trade costs from the gravity variables estimator,
the UTB estimator is U T Bij = Γ̂ij − ln(t̂GRAV
)1−σ .

In the sensitivity analysis, we experiment with σ̂ = 3 and σ̂ = 7.

(21)

Here, GRAVij is a vector of time-invariant covariates that replace the vector of pair-fixed
effects γij from specification (16) for i 6= j. When the gravity model is applied to international
trade data, the explanatory variables in GRAVij usually include the logarithm of bilateral
distance between partners i and j, whether or not the two trading countries share a common
border, whether they share a common official language, etc. More importantly, when the
bilateral fixed effects for i 6= j are replaced with observable variables, it is feasible to estimate
the full set of intra-provincial fixed effects ψii , which now appear explicitly in specification
(21). The intra-provincial fixed effect includes effects of intra-provincial distance and also
other unobservable effects.
The inclusion of ψii = ln(t1−σ
ii ) estimates in the (21) specification implies that in comparing estimation results with the full fixed effect estimator, the estimates of intra-provincial
1−σ
trade costs have to be deducted from the tGRAV
estimates before comparison with the
ij,t
corresponding indexes from the bilateral fixed effects specification. Specifically, ignoring the
time dimension, the inter-provincial trade costs from specification (21) are:

and the corresponding tariff equivalent measure is:
 0

τ̂ijGRAV = e(β̂ GRAVij −(ψ̂ii +ψ̂jj )/2)/(1−σ̂) − 1 × 100.

(23)

The tariff equivalent UTB is obtained as the difference between the tariff equivalent measures
from the fixed effects specification and from the gravity variables specification of trade costs:

τ̂ijU T B = τ̂ijF E − τ̂ijGRAV .

(24)

The UTB provides important potential clues to policy analysis (it may indicate hidden
regulatory or other border barriers) and to future research (its pattern suggests possible

21

explanations of UTB). The bilateral UTBs can be consistently aggregated using the methods of Section 2.3 to highlight overall internal barriers facing individual regions and give
perspective on their importance. We use the agnostic term Unexplained to caution that it
may not indicate an actual barrier. At a minimum, (20) gives a measure of how well the
standard parsimonious gravity treatment of trade costs performs.27
The general equilibrium volume effects of trade costs are captured by Constructed Trade
Bias estimates. We construct CTBs using the pair-fixed effects gravity specification (17).
The corresponding Constructed Trade Bias (for a generic sector) is:

(25)

The CTB measure (25) can be compared across sectors and over time because it is a pure
volume displacement ratio, predicted volume relative to an observable frictionless benchmark. We capitalize on the sectoral dimension of our data to study CTB variation across
industries. CTB variation over time is driven by two sources. First, it reflects how the
changing patterns in production and expenditures change the general equilibrium multilateral resistance terms and thus the CTBs. The importance of this channel, i.e. changing
specialization and consumption patterns as key determinants of trade costs and globalization
is emphasized in Anderson and Yotov (2011). Second, CTB changes reflect any changes in
bilateral trade costs tij,t over time. The two time-varying components, IN T\
ERP R T ij,t and
IN T\
RAP R T ij,t , in specification (25) are intended to capture such changes. In addition,
we look for other time-varying factors that influence Canadian trade costs by studying the
behavior of the estimated error term from specification (25):

Henderson and Millimet (2008) examine the consistency of the assumptions needed for an empirical
implementation of the gravity equation using parametric and non-parametric models. Our empirical specification is a hybrid of parametric and non-parametric approaches that allows for heterogeneity of intra- and
inter-regional border effects.

22

Without measurement or other random error, and if the theory is correct, the estimated error
term can be attributed exclusively to unobserved changes in the bilateral trade costs tij,t over
time.28 While trade, production and expenditure data are all subject to measurement error
(see Anderson and van Wincoop (2004)), it may be that there are systematic changes in
trade costs hiding amidst the noise.

3.2

Data

Our sample combines the data sets from Anderson and Yotov (2010), Anderson, Milot,
and Yotov (2013), and Anderson, Vesselovsky and Yotov (2012). In order to estimate the
Constructed Trade Bias indexes and internal trade costs in Canada, we use data on Canadian
trade flows (including inter-provincial, intra-provincial and international trade with the U.S.
and with the rest of the world (ROW), defined as an aggregate region that includes all
countries other than Canada and the U.S.), and data on production and expenditure for
each Canadian province and territory, for the U.S., and for ROW, all measured in current
(’00,000) Canadian dollars.29 A notable feature of our data set is that it covers most of
Canada’s economy at the sectoral level for a total of 28 industries including agriculture,
17 manufacturing sectors, aggregate manufacturing, and 9 service categories for the period
1997-2007. Finally, we also construct variables that measure bilateral distance and whether
two regions share a common border. A detailed description of our data set and sources as
well as summary statistics are included in a supplementary Data Appendix.

April 1st, 1999. Thus, our sample consists of a total of 14 regions including 12 Canadian provinces and

Estimation Results

This section presents interprovincial trade cost estimates and CTBs for total Canadian manufacturing. At the end of the section, we offer a brief summary of the results for individual
sectors and an overview of a battery of sensitivity experiments performed to test the robustness of our findings. A detailed description of all sectoral estimates and sensitivity
specifications is provided in a Supplementary Appendix.
We begin with a discussion of the bilateral interprovincial trade costs (the tij s) and their
key border effect component, the UTBs. Next we report on the neutrality test. We close
with discussion of estimates of general equilibrium effects of trade costs on bilateral and
relative interregional trade, the CTBs and CIBs.

4.1

Interprovincial Trade Costs

Estimates of interprovincial trade costs from the pair-fixed effects specification (17) are
reported first, followed by estimates based on the standard geographic proxies for bilateral
trade costs in specification (21).30 Finally, the difference between the two estimators yields
the interprovincial UTB variable, equation (20).
Results from pair fixed effects specification (17) are reported in column (1) of Table
1. The estimates of the coefficients on IN T ERP R T and IN T RAP R T indicate that the
deflection of trade from international partners into internal trade in Canada has not significantly changed for Total Manufacturing during the period of investigation. The estimates of
the interprovincial fixed effects γij of specification (17) are reported in Panel A of Table 2.
The first column in Table 2 lists each region as an exporter, while the label of each column
stands for each region as an importer.31 The diagonal elements are all zeros, reflecting the
30

Our main estimates are obtained with the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimator advocated by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006 and 2011). We also report OLS results in the sensitivity analysis.
31
The order of the Canadian provinces and territories in our tables follows the preamble of the Agreement
on Internal Trade. Specifically: Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New
Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories
and Yukon.

24

fact that the intra-provincial fixed effects are used as a reference group. In addition, due to
our symmetry assumption, we only report the interprovincial γij ’s above the diagonal. The
latter should be interpreted relative to the geometric mean of the omitted intra-provincial
fixed effects, as explained above. Finally, the last column of Table 2, labeled CA, reports
aggregate interprovincial log volume reduction estimates for each province, obtained using
the consistent aggregation procedure from Section 2.2. Three properties of the pair-fixed
effects estimates stand out. First, the off-diagonal γ̂ij ’s are all negative, large in absolute
value, and statistically significant. The estimates are quite precise but to avoid clutter, the
standard errors are suppressed. Second, the estimates vary widely across provincial partners
for each origin. Third, the estimates vary by pair.
The economic significance of the estimated interprovincial fixed effects is shown in percentage trade volume effects, as defined in equation (18), and tariff equivalent effects, as
specified in equation (19) using an assumed elasticity of substitution equal to 5. Estimates
of the trade volume effects of interprovincial trade costs are reported in Panel B of Table 2.
All off-diagonal elements in Panel B of Table 2 are less than 100. Thus, after controlling for
origin and destination province-specific characteristics, interprovincial trade is significantly
smaller than intra-provincial trade. For example, the estimate of 9.49 for pair NL-NS implies that trade between these two provinces is only about 10 percent of the average internal
trade for these regions. Second, Panel B reveals significant heterogeneity in the estimates
of bilateral trade costs across different pairs. Finally, the aggregate estimates at the provincial level, reported in column CA reveal that YT, NT and NL are the regions with the
largest deviation of interprovincial from intra-provincial trade, while ON, AB, and QC are
the regions with the smallest corresponding deviation. The bottom right element of Panel
B reports that overall interprovincial manufacturing trade in Canada is about 5.2 percent of
the intra-provincial trade.
The tariff equivalent measures in Panel C of Table 2 tell a similar story. The large
and significant interprovincial trade costs estimates translate into large and significant tariff

25

equivalents. After controlling for all possible province-specific characteristics, trade between
more developed regions is subject to lower tariff equivalent inter-provincial trade costs, while
trade between more remote regions faces much larger tariff equivalents. The latter is captured
by the very large numbers clustered in the last two columns of Panel C (NT and YT).
Using the consistent aggregation procedures from Section 2.2, we find that the average
interprovincial trade costs in Canada are equivalent to a tax of 109%, varying between 82%
for ON and 319% for YT. The magnitude and the pattern of variation depict geographical
forces but may include regulatory and other barriers.
The fixed effects estimates in Panel A of Table 2 are in principle comparable to the directly
p
observable tetrads estimates Xij Xji /Xii Xjj . Tetrads estimates contain the random error
terms that are minimized in specification (17) by controlling for origin-time and destinationtime fixed effects (and a particular form of time variation in the bilateral fixed effects). We
test the fit of tetrads to our estimator by estimating:
q
ln( Xij Xji /Xii Xjj ) = a0 + a1 γ̂ij + ij ,

(27)

If tetrads is accurate, estimates should satisfy a0 = 0, a1 − 1 = 0 with a very high R2 .
Results are in Table 3. The first column of Table 3 reports findings with panel data while
the remaining columns report yearly results. First, very high R2 values obtain throughout.
Second, while all estimates of γ̂ij are statistically significant and close to one,32 formal chisquared tests for a1 = 1 fail to reject the null hypothesis for the panel specification and
for 6 of the 11 yearly specifications. Third, estimated constant terms are small, but only
five of the estimates of a0 are not statistically different from zero. Furthermore, as can be
seen from the last row in both panels of Table 3, chi-square tests reject all of the joint tests
a0 = a1 − 1 = 0. We conclude that tetrads has systematic difference from the bilateral fixed
effects estimator, despite being very highly correlated. Mechanically, the rejection occurs
because the origin- and destination-time fixed effects of our estimator control for systematic
32

All standard errors are bootstrapped and clustered by country-pair.

26

elements in the random variables that enter the tetrads measure.33
Next, we replace the country-pair fixed effects from specification (17) with observable
geographic trade cost proxies, bilateral distance and contiguity. Recent gravity studies decompose distance effects into intervals. Eaton and Kortum (2002) use aggregate world data
and split the effects of distance into four intervals. They find that the estimate of the distance coefficient for shorter distances is larger (in absolute value) than for longer distances.
Anderson and Yotov (2011) find a non-monotonic (inverted u-shape) relationship between
distance and disaggregated goods trade flows in the world. Following these studies, we split
distance in four intervals, which correspond to the four quantiles of our distance variable. In
addition, we define CON T IG P R P Rij as an indicator variable that takes the value of one
when two provinces or territories share a common border, and it is equal to zero otherwise.34
The estimating equation becomes:

where DIST AN CE 1 corresponds to the smallest quantile and DIST AN CE 4 corresponds
to the largest quantile.
Estimation results from specification (28) are reported in column (2) of Table 1. As
expected, distance is a significant impediment to interprovincial trade: all of the four distance estimates are sizable, negative, and statistically significant. In addition, the smallest
estimate (in absolute value) is for the smallest distance interval (DIST AN CE 1), and the
largest estimate is for the largest interval (DIST AN CE 4). We also see evidence of nonmonotonic effects, as the estimate on (DIST AN CE 3) is smaller than the estimate on
(DIST AN CE 2). Second, the estimate on CON T IG P R P Rij is positive but statistically
33

Our time-pairwise fixed effect coefficients are not statistically significant.
When applied to international trade flows, the gravity model consistently delivers positive and significant
estimates on CON T IG P R P Rij suggesting that, all else equal, countries that share a common border trade
more with each other.

insignificant and very small in magnitude, βcontig = 0.055 (std.err. 0.041). The small and
economically insignificant estimate on CON T IG P R P Rij is in contrast with the large, positive and statistically significant estimates from the international gravity literature. Based
on the results, contiguity is not a significant determinant of interprovincial trade in Canada,
though it plays an important role in international trade.35
Comparing the standard gravity variables estimator with the pairwise fixed effects estimator account for interprovincial trade costs in Canada, row AIC of Table 1 reports estimates
of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), used to compare non-nested alternative econometric specifications. The difference between AIC for the bilateral fixed effects specification
and AIC for the gravity specification is 1.82, less than the threshold of 2 that the usual rule
of thumb suggests, which provides ‘substantial’ support for the gravity specification relative
to the bilateral fixed effects specification (Burnham and Anderson (2002)). Combined with
the insignificant estimate of the effects of contiguity, this finding suggests that distance alone
is a very powerful predictor of bilateral trade costs within Canada. Second, the correlation
between the trade costs constructed from the fixed effects specification (17) and the corresponding trade costs constructed from gravity variables specification (28) is ρ = 0.95. This
very high correlation coefficient suggests that distance and contiguity alone predict the order of intra-provincial trade costs very well. Furthermore, the volume effects and the tariff
equivalent indexes from the specification with gravity variables (see Panels A and B of Table
4), depict trade cost patterns that are similar to those form Table 2.
Despite high correlation, there are significant differences in the size of estimated interprovincial trade costs. The difference between the results of the estimators (17) and (28),
pushing inference to the limit, indicates provincial border barriers or stimuli. The border
tax equivalent is the difference between the interprovincial tax equivalents from Panel C of
35

A possible explanation for the failure of contiguity to matter much is that it matters differently for
trade between the large contiguous provinces and their partners, such as ON and QC, than it does for
trade between small and remote contiguous provinces such as NT and YT. This hypothesis can be tested by
introducing individual indicator variables for each possible pair of contiguous provinces in our sample. We
choose not to do this since it essentially introduces 15 of the bilateral fixed effects.

28

Table 2 (τijF E , obtained from the bilateral fixed effects specification (19)) and the corresponding tariff equivalent estimates from Panel B of Table 4 (τ̂ijGRAV , obtained from the gravity
variables specification (23)). The ad-valorem border tax equivalent of the UTB is thus:

τ̂ijU T B = τ̂ijF E − τ̂ijGRAV .

(29)

τ̂ij estimates are reported in Panel C of Table 4. Note first that there are significant
differences from zero in many cases. (Standard errors are not reported to avoid clutter, but
the bilateral fixed effect estimates are very precise, indicating statistical significance of the
UTBs.36 ) Second, there are some positive and some negative τ̂ijU T B ’s: some bilateral borders
are dams and some are spillways. The dispersion of τ̂ijU T B s awaits explanation, but some
patterns emerge from aggregation. Column CA of Table 4 reports consistently aggregated
tariff equivalent differences for each province with its Canadian partners using (13) with and
without border effects. Overall interprovincial trade is subject to a 5.63% internal border
tax equivalent on aggregate manufacturing, reported in Table 4, Panel C, at the bottom
of the column headed CA. The 5.63% border tax equivalent is associated with a 19.7%
volume reduction of aggregate Canadian manufacturing sales, worth CAD 20.3 billion.37
Disaggregating by province of origin produces the results in the remainder of that column.
The positive overall τ̂ijU T B s for ten of the twelve regions suggest pervasive internal border
frictions. The τ̂ijU T B s are the largest for YT, NT and QC. A striking finding is the relatively
high 15% internal border tax faced on average by Quebec. Language difference is directly
controlled for by origin and destination fixed effects, so some other force must be involved
that varies bilaterally. Two provinces (NS and PE) enjoy the equivalent of a small export
subsidy for interprovincial trade.
36

A theoretically satisfactory standard error can be constructed from bootstrapping over repeated estimation of both specifications and generation of the UTBs. We eschew this computationally intensive method
in this report.

CAD 103 billion. The product is equal to CAD 20.3, a simple partial equilibrium measure of efficiency gains
from the removal of interprovincial trade barriers.

29

Third, the rightmost column, labeled CA(FE), records the partial equilibrium average
tariff equivalent obtained using the fixed weights associated with the multilateral resistances
from the bilateral fixed effects estimation. The large differences between columns CA and
CA(FE) demonstrate the importance of consistent aggregation. The difference is due to
general equilibrium forces acting on inward multilateral resistance (buyers’ incidence): in
this case most of the economic significance of UTBs is due to the general equilibrium effects.
Fourth, τ̂ijU T B varies across provincial pairs across any exporter row, usually being larger
for the more remote and small regions and smaller for the more developed regions. Thus,
gravity variables ‘explain’ more of trade costs between the larger provinces/territories, although our gravity estimation explicitly controls for size with origin and destination fixed
effects and for remoteness with bilateral distance. The observed patterns suggest that something apart from log-linearity is involved.
The variation across provinces and provincial pairs may indicate where policy intervention
is needed most. But τ̂ijU T B interpretation is tentative only, due to unknown bilateral effects.38

4.2

Neutrality Test

Section 2.2 showed that system (1)-(3) is invariant to any intra-regional trade cost tii if the
general trade cost function g(rij , rii , rjj ) is Cobb-Douglas: the neutral case of comparative
statics. Econometrically, intra-regional trade costs are not identified separately from multilateral resistance. The Cobb-Douglas restriction can be tested by estimating specification:

UT B
For example, if the set of gravity variables in (28) is incomplete, τ̂ij
will be biased. In other words, more
information might be extracted with more details about the types of bilateral relationships (i.e., infrastructure
details) between the provinces in our sample. This point is especially relevant at the sectoral level. In
addition, it is possible that the gravity variables that we use already proxy for institutional and policy
measures intended to promote interprovincial trade. For example, contiguous provinces are more likely
to cooperate with each other. As an example of close cooperation between contiguous provinces consider
Alberta and British Columbia who signed the Trade, Investment and Labour Mobility Agreement (TILMA)
in 2007. Due to data limitations, we cannot study the effects of TILMA here.

volume effects based on the specification with gravity variables. (Note that this specification
is independent of the elasticity of substitution.) Neutrality requires satisfying two restrictions
on estimated coefficients: ω2 + 1/2 = 0 and ω3 + 1/2 = 0. Violation of the pair of restrictions
means that the fixed effect estimates still contain some influence of rii and rjj , contrary to
neutrality. Homogeneity implies ω0 = 0, ω1 + ω2 + ω3 = 0. Specification (30) permits tests
of these restrictions.
An initial benchmark estimates (30) subject to ω2 = ω3 = 0. Bootstrapping delivers
standard errors and confidence intervals for the coefficients.39 The results, reported in column

(1) of Table 5, reveal: (i) The estimate on ln t̂GRAV

the R2 = .48; and (iii) the estimate of the constant term is statistically significant and very
large. Thus, the pair-fixed effects estimates are rather weakly correlated with the bilateral
gravity variables trade costs, effectively bilateral distances.
Column (2) of Table 5 presents estimates of (30) with unrestricted ωs. (i) The R2 = .94
increases very significantly; (ii) ω̂1 is closer to 1 and still not statistically different from 1;
(iii) ω̂2 and ω̂3 are each statistically greater in absolute value than −1/2 and their sum is
statistically smaller than −1, all at the 1% level of confidence; (iv) ω̂0 is smaller in absolute
value, but statistically and quantitatively significantly less than 0;40 (v) ω̂1 + ω̂2 + ω̂3 < 0.
Result (i) implies that intra-regional trade cost ψ̂ii variation is significant and contributes
significantly to explaining the variation of bilateral fixed effects. Results (i) and (ii) together
indicate that intra-regional cost variation is almost uncorrelated with bilateral distance.
Result (iii) implies that neutrality is rejected, intra-regional trade costs have an effect on
inter-regional trade costs that is not absorbed by origin and destination fixed effects. Results
(iv) and (v) imply that Cobb-Douglas homogeneity of degree zero is rejected: the chi-squared

Column (3) of Table 5 reports estimates of (30) subject to the constraint ω2 + ω3 = −1.
The results imply that, subject to the constraint, the values of ω1 = 1 and ω0 = 0 and
ω2 = ω3 = −1/2 used in constructing the UTBs cannot be rejected. The homogeneity
hypothesis in the constrained model is not rejected: the chi-squared test for the combined
restrictions ω0 = 0, ω1 + ω2 + ω3 = 0 has a p-value of 0.1274. Thus the constraint effectively
imposes the homogeneity of degree one property of the general trade cost function on the
structure of the pairwise fixed effects estimator.41
The residuals of the constrained regression necessarily have zero mean and the intercept
is not significantly different from zero. The residuals are thus statistically equivalent to
the constructed UTBs. Subject to the constraint, there is no average levels effect generating
differences between the pairwise fixed effects and the gravity variables estimates, hence there
is no average levels effect in the constructed UTBs. Columns (2) and (3) taken together
imply nonrandom residuals of the constrained regression and hence nonrandom constructed
UTBs. The regressors with unconstrained values of ω0 , ω2 , ω3 , reported in column (2),
pick up systematic patterns in the UTBs. Hence the deviation of the ln(tFijE )1−σ s from the

Taking specification (30) and the results in Table 5 seriously, rising (over the cross section)
intra-national trade costs induce drops in inter-regional and international trade (≈ −0.1(ψii +

neutrality and the clues provided by the test pose a challenge for future research — exploring
the connection between intra-regional and inter-regional trade costs.

CTB Estimates

our sample, are reported in Panel A of Table 6. In the absence of any trade frictions, all

elements of the CTB matrices, not just the diagonal elements, would be equal to 1. Home
bias in provincial trade is massive as all diagonal elements in Table 6, Panel A, are much
larger than their frictionless counterpart of 1. More developed and central provinces exhibit
smaller intra-provincial biases than relatively distant and less developed regions like YT,
NT, and PE. This is now a familiar pattern due to the strong tendency for larger regions
to have lower multilateral resistances because they naturally do more trade with themselves
(Anderson and van Wincoop (2003); Anderson and Yotov (2010)). Variation in the pattern
of bilateral trade costs faced by regions plays a role, but the size-multilateral-resistance link
is dramatic.
The off-diagonal elements in Panel A are generally larger than 1 but smaller than the
intra-provincial bias for all regions, as for AB and BC where Constructed Home Bias is
4 to 6 times larger than the CTBs for their bilateral trade. International borders deflect
potential trade into domestic trade, but the deflection into local trade is much greater.
The off-diagonal estimates in Panel A of Table 6 also reveal that more developed provinces
demonstrate larger inter-provincial biases as exporters than as importers. In contrast, less
developed and more remote regions, such as YT, PE, and NT, tend to have larger interprovincial biases as importers than as exporters.42 This is also captured in the provincial
overall CTBs in the last column of Table 6, using the aggregation procedures from Section
2.2 to calculate the interprovincial CTBs for each province as an exporter. YT, NT, and
NL are the regions with the lowest average CTB indexes in the sample. These patterns are
explained by equation (5) and the very strong tendency for larger economic regions to have
lower inward multilateral resistance Pj . Thus, small economies have high costs of trade on
average across all sources, so any particular exporter has a higher priced competition on
average when selling to smaller regions.43
42

Notably, the only three CTB indexes that we obtain that are lower than or equal one are for exports
from NT to ON, and for exports from YT to QC and ON.
43
The reason for the negative association of economic size and inward multilateral resistance is essentially
because small regions naturally have to trade more with the outside and thus incur higher trade costs than
do big regions. See Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), and especially Anderson and Yotov (2010) for more
details on this argument.

33

Constructed Interregional Bias formalized in equation (5) measures the relative deflection of interprovincial trade into intra-provincial trade due to trade costs both directly and
indirectly. Πij /Πii = (CIBij )1/(1−σ) measures relative sellers’ incidence on inter-provincial
trade, from equation (10). Panel B of Table 6 reports this relative sellers’ incidence for each
province/territory on sales to each province. The off-diagonal elements in Panel B are all
greater than one, reflecting the larger frictions that each province faces when shipping to
the rest of Canada as compared to shipping internally.44 A clear pattern in Panel B is that
more developed regions face lower relative resistance as compared to less developed regions.
This is captured clearly by the provincial estimates in the last column of Panel B, where
we see that ON and QC are the two provinces that enjoy the lowest relative resistance to
interprovincial shipments in Canada. Despite the fact the YT and NT are the two territories
with the lowest CTB indexes as exporters (see Panel A), these are two regions that face the
largest relative resistance to inter-provincial trade.
The UTB contribution to CTB is a general equilibrium complement to the partial equilibrium UTB measures in Panel C of Table 4. Panel C of Table 6 reports percentage differences
between CTBs from the pairwise fixed effects estimator and the gravity variables estimator.
First, note that the diagonal elements in Panel C are very small, all less than 1 percent
in absolute value. This result should be expected, because in both specifications the intraregional trade costs is normalized to 1, the difference between the two is due entirely to the
difference in the multilateral resistances in the two specifications.45 Second, the off-diagonal
elements are sizable and vary in sign. Interestingly, the signs of the corresponding general
equilibrium UTB estimates from Panel C of Table 6 and those from Panel C of Table 4 are
often opposite. Thus the general equilibrium effects of UTBs are strong and often outweigh
their direct partial equilibrium effects.
Percentage changes in CTBs over time in Manufacturing from 1997 to 2007 are reported
44
45

The exception is relative sellers incidence equal to one on shipments from ON to NT.
That is, the origin and destination fixed effects differ in the two estimations.

34

in Table 7.46 First, intra-provincial CTBs have decreased for all provinces save BC and NB,
with increases of 2% and 4.2%, respectively. Most provinces are becoming more integrated
with the world. The fall in intra-provincial CTBs is largest for the remote regions YT (79%)
and NT (62%). Second, the changes in inter-provincial CTBs off the diagonal in Table 7 are
mixed, but with some consistent patterns. First, the more remote regions experience a fall
in the CTBs for exports, exemplified by decreases for NT and for YT with any other region
in our sample. These remote regions thus have become less integrated with the rest of the
Canadian provinces over 1997-2007. Subtracting the diagonal terms gives the percentage
change in CIBs, offsetting most of the fall for YT but not for NT. ON and MB are other
provinces that experience lower CTBs for their exports to most provinces and territories,
but in their cases the fall in intra-regional CTB implies a rise in CIBs. CTB changes at the
province level are summarized in the last column in Table 7, where we report consistently
aggregated provincial numbers. YT, NT, ON and MB are the four regions where CTB fell
over the period 1997-2007. The rest of the Canadian provinces and territories register an
increase in CTB.
The overall rise in CTBs in the last column (supplemented by subtracting the diagonal
terms to obtain CIBs) suggests that most of the Canadian provinces and territories have
become more integrated in manufacturing trade over the period 1997-2007 (extending a
result reported by Anderson and Yotov (2010)). NT is the big exception. This result is driven
by changes in the provincial output and expenditure shares in manufacturing, because, as
discussed earlier, there is little evidence of time variation in the bilateral trade costs.

4.4

Analysis of Residuals and Sensitivity Experiments

The credibility of our results is buttressed by analysis of the residuals and sensitivity to
variations of the model specification.
Residuals are defined in equation (26) as the difference between the actual data and

It should be noted that comparisons of the CTB estimates over time are subject to reliability of ROW
data, which is used to construct the value of world output for each sector.

35

the fitted CTBs. Residuals are primarily due to measurement error in the trade, output
and expenditure data, but may also indicate time-varying trade costs or specification error.
Systematic sign switches of residuals over time could vitiate our use of panel structure to
identify UTBs. Systematic under- or over- prediction for pairs could indicate departure
from the iceberg (log-linearity of) trade costs assumed in (15). The residuals data reveal
very few instances where the residuals for a given pair are steadily positive or negative up
to a given year and then switch signs until the end of the period, suggesting that the model
does not omit a systematically important time-varying explanatory variable. (The data set
of residuals is available by request.) The examination of residuals combines with the finding
of no significant time-varying effects captured by IN T ERP R Tij,t and IN T RAP R Tij,t from
specification (17) to suggests that internal trade costs in Canada were stable between 1997
and 2007.
Systematic under- or over-predictions across years occur for only 18 of the 144 possible
pairs of provinces and territories in our sample.47 The scarcity of such examples indicates
randomness rather than non-iceberg trade costs.
A full cross section display of residuals for 2002 (the mid-year of the sample) is expressed
in percentage terms for comparability in Table 8. Note first that the residuals are mostly
not systematically signed: each row and column contains positive and negative elements.
This is consistent with the process generating the  realizations being a zero mean random
generator. Second, in terms of distribution across provinces and across provincial pairs, the
biggest discrepancies between the data and the model predictions (based on the dispersion of
the residuals) are for YT and NT, followed by NL and PE. In contrast, the model performs
best for QC, followed by AB, BC and ON. Thus, the model performs best for the big
provinces and worst for the smallest provinces. Note that this is so even after the rich
47

For example, on average, the largest (as percent) over-predictions of our model are for ‘exports’ from NT
to MB and from NT to SK, and the largest under-prediction is for shipments from YT to BC. In most cases,
the model over-predicts or under-predicts either the exports or the imports for a given province/territory
from another province or territory. In a few instances there are systematic differences in each direction for
a given pair. For instance, the model over-predicts shipments from AB to BC but under-predicts shipments
from BC to AB.

36

system of fixed effects controls for time-varying province-specific effects (both as importer
and exporter) and for time-invariant bilateral effects. This pattern is explained by less
efficient estimators for YT and NT (due to lack of data for these territories), or it may
reflect meaningless randomness. It certainly implies some heteroskedasticity not controlled
for in our econometric specification.
We perform six robustness checks with variations on the model, described in detail in a
Supplementary Appendix available by request. Our findings are robust to all six variations.
First, we allow for asymmetric bilateral fixed effects in equation (15). Differences are small,
hence symmetry is consistent with the data. Second, the base elasticity of substitution value
(σ = 5) is replaced by values of 3 and 7. The interprovincial trade costs estimated using
the fixed effects approach and the standard gravity variables are qualitatively identical to
our main estimates and the quantitative differences are intuitive. Third, OLS estimation of
the log-linearized gravity equation yields very similar results to PPML estimation. Fourth,
suspicious of the role played by large rest-of-the-world (ROW) aggregate and US regions, we
exclude them consecutively from our sample. The estimates of interprovincial trade costs
are unaffected.48 Fifth, we replace all missing trade values in the data with zeros. The
CTB indexes, the interprovincial trade costs and the tariff equivalents remain qualitatively
unchanged with only minor quantitative changes. Sixth, we employ only data for the years
1997, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007.49 There are no significant differences between the
set of estimates with two-year lags and the main estimates.

4.5

Sectoral Estimates

The sectoral pairwise fixed effects and gravity estimates and their sectoral tariff-equivalent
indexes are generally consistent with the findings for ‘Total Manufacturing’. Across all
sectors and all exporter-importer pairs, the interprovincial tax equivalents of all costs are
48

The reason for insensitivity is that we use the most flexible fixed effects specification to account for trade
costs with US and ROW.
49
Cheng and Wall (2005) argue against the use of fixed effects with “... data pooled over consecutive years
on the grounds that dependent and independent variables cannot fully adjust in a single year’s time.”(p.8).

37

greater than the intra-provincial tariff equivalents. ‘Health’, ‘Education’, and ‘Finance’ are
the sectors with the largest tax equivalents, whereas ‘Leather, Rubber, Plastic’ and ‘Hosiery
and Clothing’ are the sectors with the smallest tax equivalents.50 The UTB sectoral border
tax equivalents, consistently aggregated across all provinces, range from 86.3% for ‘Health’ to
-12.6% for ‘Agriculture’. We find some positive and some negative UTBs both across sectors
for a given region and across regions for a given sector. Overall, the results suggest that
provinces/territories face interprovincial trade costs beyond those associated with bilateral
distance and contiguity.
Generally, the CTB indexes for the disaggregated sectors are consistent with the ‘Total Manufacturing’ findings. Constructed Home Bias CHBii = CT Bii is large and varies
considerably by province i, largest for the small remote ones. Looking at CHB consistently
aggregated over provinces across sectors for 2002, the largest values are for ‘Agriculture’,
‘Hosiery and Clothing’, and ‘Health’. The CIBs (CIBij = CT Bij /CT Bii ) for each sector
are significantly less than one. Their 1/(1 − σ) power transforms are thus greater than one,
suggesting that inter-provincial sellers’ incidence of trade costs is significantly higher than
intra-provincial incidence. Overall CIB 1/(1−σ) is higher for services sectors than for goods
sectors, which implies that relative sellers’ incidence to inter-regional trade is higher. Among
the services categories, the highest CIB 1/(1−σ) values are for ‘Health’ and ‘Finance’, while
‘Furniture’, ‘Textile Products, ‘Wood, Pulp, Paper’ exhibit the lowest CIB 1/(1−σ) values.
Over time, the average greater integration of Canada’s provinces with each other and the
world in both goods and services conceals some declines. All effects are due to changing
location of sales and expenditure; we find no evidence of changing trade costs. ‘Leather,
Rubber, and Plastic’, ‘Hosiery and Clothing’, and ‘Fabricated Metal’ are among the sectors
with the steadiest CTB decline (trade is falling further below its frictionless benchmark). In
contrast, consistent with the overall picture of rising integration, ‘Wholesale’, ‘Education’,
and ‘Health’ generally exhibit increases in inter-provincial CTBs over time.

Conclusion

A novel econometric method is applied to flexibly estimate bilateral intra-national trade
costs. The results imply that bilateral trade flows are not invariant to intra-regional costs
(neutrality is rejected). The results suggest there is much to be learned from drilling deeper
into inter- and intra-regional trade costs and their relationship.
We estimate large Canadian interprovincial trade costs. On average for manufacturing,
interprovincial trade in Canada is subject to frictions from all sources, including the effects of
distance, that are equivalent to a tax of 109%. After accounting for the role of distance and
contiguity, the interprovincial border is equivalent to a border tax of 5.6% for manufacturing,
an average which varies considerably by province.

Notes: This table presents estimates based on specification (17), where trade costs are controlled
for with bilateral fixed effects. Panel A reports estimates of the bilateral fixed effects γij obtained
with a panel PPML estimator. All estimates are highly statistically significant. Standard errors
(clustered by pair) are omitted for brevity. Panel B and Panel C report the corresponding volume
effects and tariff-equivalents, respectively. “*” is used to denote that only one-way trade flows are
used to obtain the corresponding estimate. See text for more details.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the Constructed Trade Bias index, as defined in specification
(25). Panel A reports CTBs in levels for 2002, while Panel B reports Constructed Inter-provincial Bias
values (as defined in (5)). Panel C reports percentage differences between the CTB indexes constructed
using the fixed effects method (17), and the standard gravity variables approach, (28). See text for
more details.
