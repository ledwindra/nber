Introduction
This paper examines the contribution of ability to the rise in the economic
return to education. A common view in both the popular and professional
literatures is that much of the increase in the return to education can be
attributed to an increase in the return to ability. Herrnstein and Murray
(1994) make this a cornerstone of their analysis. They refer to the research
of Blackburn and Neumark (1993) who report that the rise in the economic
return to education is concentrated among those with high ability, a di¤erent
proposition from the one stated by Herrnstein and Murray, but not necessarily inconsistent with it. In a similar vein, Murnane, Levy and Willett (1995)
conclude that a substantial fraction of the rise in the return to education
between 1978 and 1986 for young workers can be attributed to a rise in the
return to ability. When they condition on ability, the rise in the economic
return to education is diminished.
The implicit assumptions that govern much of this literature are (1) that
ability is valued in the market (or is a proxy for characteristics that are valued), (2) that the price of ability (or the proxied characteristics) is rising in
the new market for skills, and (3) that ability is correlated with education.
As a consequence of these assumptions, failure to control for ability leads
to an upward bias in the estimated economic return to education, and the
bias is greater in periods when the return to ability is greater. This is one
possible explanation for a positive interaction of education, time and ability.
Other explanations are (a) that the correlation between ability and schooling

3

is increasing over time, due to increasing application of the meritocratic principle in educational enrollment, even if the return to ability remains constant
(Herrnstein and Murray, 1994) or (b) that ability-education bundles produce
skills that are more valued in the new economy, the skills are superadditive
functions of ability and education (Rubinstein and Tsiddon, 1999) and the
demand for the highest skills has increased disproportionately.
The small ability bias reported in Chamberlain and Griliches (1975) may
be a consequence of the low economic return to ability in the time period
of their samples. Ability bias will be greater in an era with greater return
to ability or a more meritocratic relationship between schooling and ability.
Herrnstein and Murray (1994) argue that both of these factors are at work
in the modern economy.
Ability bias is usually discussed as a problem of omitted variables (see,
e.g. Griliches, 1977 or Chamberlain and Griliches 1975). Include the missing
ability variable and, except for problems of measurement error, there will be
no bias. The conventional formulation of the ability bias problem ignores
the strong dependence between education and ability which Herrnstein and
Murray (1994) argue has become stronger in recent years. If the dependence
between ability and education becomes too strong, it is impossible to isolate
the e¤ect of education from ability even when the latter is perfectly observed.
This gives rise to the logically prior problem of sorting bias, discussed in this
paper.
Table 1 shows that there are very few white male college graduates with
low ability in the NLSY. Further, there are no white men with postgradu4

ate education in the lowest ability quartile, so for that ability quartile, no
estimate of the wage gain of such education is possible. For many schoolingability pairs, the cells are empty (or nearly so), making it di¢cult to isolate
separate ability e¤ects and schooling e¤ects, and making main e¤ects of ability and education di¢cult, if not impossible, to identify. In the limit, if ability
and education are perfectly strati…ed, there is no way to isolate returns to
education from returns to ability, even if ability is perfectly measured. Empirically, the two are indistinguishable.1
Missing data also complicate attempts to separate the e¤ects of age and
time. Estimates of the role of ability in explaining the increasing return to
schooling that are reported in the recent literature follow the same people,
or repeated cross section samples of the same cohorts, over time. To follow
the same people or cohort over time is also to follow them as they age. The
econometric problem created by such samples is more severe than the usual
age-period-cohort e¤ect problem.2 Figure 1 is a Lexis diagram for a single
cohort of a speci…ed initial age followed over time. Darkened cells indicate the
data that exist for each age and time period. If panel data or repeated cross
section data consist of only a single age cohort, age and time are hopelessly
confounded. It is impossible to identify separate age and time e¤ects. Even
with multiple age cohorts (see, e.g., Figure 2 for the data structure of the
NLSY panel) there are many empty cells. The “main e¤ects” for time or
age, de…ned as averages over entire rows and columns, cannot be computed.
(In the age-period-cohort problem these averages can be identi…ed if cohort
e¤ects are suppressed.) Some of the components required to form these
5

means are missing. It is also impossible to identify interactions associated
with the empty cells without imposing parametric structure (e.g., that age
and time e¤ects are linear so that trends …t on nonempty data cells apply to
the empty ones).
The current literature on ability bias ignores the …rst problem (strong
dependence between education and ability) and implicitly solves the second
problem in two distinct ways. Some authors impose linearity of time and/or
age e¤ects (e.g. Blackburn and Neumark, 1993; Bishop, 1991; Grogger and
Eide, 1995) and arbitrarily suppress certain interactions.3 Although a fully
nonparametric model is not identi…ed, the hypothesis of linearity is testable.
We demonstrate that the NLSY data are at odds with the widely-used assumptions that time and age e¤ects are linear. Invoking linearity solves the
identi…cation problem but imposes unjusti…ed restrictions across time periods and ages. Murnane, Levy and Willet (1995) solve the second problem in
a di¤erent way by estimating the contribution of ability to eliminating the
rise in the return to education measured at one age in two di¤erent years.
This procedure leaves open the question of whether their results are special
to the age they choose.
This paper is organized into two sections. The …rst section discusses the
identi…cation problems that arise from using panel data or repeated cross
section data to separate time and age e¤ects that arise from the strong strati…cation of ability and education. There we present the combinations of
parameters that can be estimated from panel data. An appendix derives
the precise combinations of interactions that can be identi…ed when cells are
6

missing.
In Section 2 we test and reject the widely-used speci…cation that age and
time e¤ects are linear. Estimates from nonparametric procedures indicate
mild support for the point of view that in the mid-80s there was an increase
in the college-high school wage di¤erential for the most able. This pattern
is not found for other ability and schooling groups for which nonparametric
estimates can be obtained. This produces a more nuanced interpretation of
the ability - schooling - time interaction than that reported in the recent
literature.

1

Estimating Interactions and Main E¤ects
From Incomplete Data
Assume that the log wage at age a and time t can be decomposed into

main e¤ects and interaction:
`n w(a; t) = ®(a) + ¯(t) + °(a; t);

a = 1; ::; A; t = 1; ::; T

where ®(a) is the age main e¤ect, ¯(t) is the time main e¤ect and °(a; t)
is the interaction of age and time. To simplify the exposition, we implicitly
condition on education and ability.
The bene…t of observing two age cohorts facing common year e¤ects is
that we observe the same age in two di¤erent years (except for certain ages
in the …rst and last years), and two di¤erent ages in the same year. With
access to such data, we can estimate a nonparametric additive model
7

(1.1)

`n w(a; t) = ®(a) + ¯(t);

a = 1; ::; A; t = 1; ::; T

if we suppress the interaction °(a; t). First, we make one normalization, e.g.
®(1) = 0. With this normalization, ¯(1) is identi…ed. Using this knowledge
of ¯(1), we can identify ®(2) since
`n w(2; 1) = ®(2) + ¯(1):
Proceeding in this fashion, the main time and age e¤ects are identi…ed.4
It is also possible in this case to identify an interaction between age and
time if we assume, as does much of the literature, that age and time e¤ects
are linear i.e. if we assume that
¯(t) ¡ ¯(t ¡ ¢) = b¢
®(a) ¡ ®(a ¡ ') = c'
where b and c are scalars and ¢ and ' are integers. Under the assumption
of linearity, it is possible to identify interaction °(a; t) and hence term d
in °(a; t) = dat; provided that T ¸ 2 and A ¸ 2. There are only three
parameters, and they can be identi…ed from four or more cells.
It is important to observe that identi…cation is achieved by imposing
arbitrary conventions. In the NLSY, only the blackened cells in Figure 2
are available. The problem of empty o¤-diagonal cells substantially restricts
what can be learned in two major ways. First, it prevents identi…cation of
unconditional age and time main e¤ects. The unconditional time e¤ect is the
average time-speci…c e¤ect for every age cohort, not just those observed in the
8

data. Likewise, the unconditional age e¤ect is the average e¤ect for persons
of a given age, across all time periods, not simply those observed in the data.
Since we do not observe every age in every year (i.e., since we have empty
o¤-diagonal cells), it is impossible to estimate these unconditional e¤ects.
Instead, we can estimate conditional main e¤ects: age e¤ects conditional on
the times observed, and time e¤ects conditional on the ages observed. This
problem is distinct from the linear dependence that arises in the standard
age-period-cohort e¤ect problem. That problem arises even when all the cells
of Figures 1 and 2 are available. The problem discussed in this paper arises
even if there are no cohort e¤ects. A formal comparison of unconditional and
conditional e¤ects is presented in Appendix B.
The second major e¤ect of empty data cells is to limit the number of
identi…able interactions. Speci…cally, interactions associated with empty data
cells obviously cannot be identi…ed. If only one age cohort is observed (as in
Figure 1), no main e¤ects or interactions are identi…ed. They are hopelessly
confounded as the single age cohort simultaneously ages and enters a new
economic environment. Given two age cohorts, all main e¤ects are identi…ed
if interactions are assumed to be zero. For three or more age cohorts, certain
combinations of interactions are identi…ed. Individual interactions cannot be
identi…ed. The problem is more severe at the boundary ages (for the youngest
and oldest workers) where certain ages are observed for the …rst or last time.
This feature of the identi…cation problem is unfortunate because, as noted in
Cawley, Heckman, Lochner and Vytlacil (1999), considerable attention has
been devoted to interactions for the youngest age groups in the NLSY.
9

The absence of identi…able interactions outside the black band displayed
in Figure 2 means that any test for the absence of interactions is actually tests
whether or not linear combinations of the identi…ed interactions are zero. The
distinction is important because even if there are nonzero interactions, it is
possible that the combination of interactions that can be estimated will be
zero. Any test will have zero power against such an alternative.5 The combinations of interactions that can be identi…ed and tested are characterized
in Appendix B.
The literature copes with the identi…cation problem in various ways. Different strategies lead to very di¤erent empirical results. Bishop (1991) assumes linear time and age e¤ects. Blackburn and Neumark (1993) assume
linear age e¤ects and linear time e¤ects in the interactions they estimate.
Grogger and Eide (1995) assume linear experience e¤ects and but no age
e¤ects. None of the studies summarized in Cawley, Heckman, Lochner and
Vytlacil (1999) …ts a model with time and age e¤ects estimated for each
education-ability cell. Studies di¤er in which interactions are estimated and
suppressed.
We have outlined the limitations that stem from empty data cells. However, there is an additional estimation problem that is tantamount in practice
to an identi…cation problem: data cells that are nonempty but contain little
data. The problem of missing data on age and time is compounded because
estimates are often conditional on ability and education, making the problem
one of missing and sparse data in a four-dimensional grid (age, time, ability,
and education). In addition, some ability-education cells are missing and
10

others are sparse (see Table 1). This means that it is impossible to identify
all education-ability interactions. Main e¤ects for education are formed only
over a subset of the ability cells. In the limit, with perfect strati…cation of
education with ability, the main e¤ects are interaction e¤ects. The inability to identify main e¤ects attributable to either ability or education is the
problem of sorting bias.
The next section of the paper reexamines the wage returns to ability and
education. We nonparametrically estimate conditional time and age main
e¤ects and the identi…ed combinations of interactions. In order to conduct a
nonparametric analysis, we necessarily must limit the number of variables we
include in the model. This means that our models contain fewer regressors
than previous models that investigate the returns to ability over time and
the education-ability-time interaction.

2

Nonparametric Estimates of Main E¤ects
and Interactions
To address these identi…cation problems, we use extracts from the NLSY

data documented in Appendix A. The NLSY is a panel data set with unusually rich information on measures of cognitive ability. Table 2 presents the
components of the ASVAB test reported in the NLSY.
For our measure of ability, we use general intelligence, or g, which we
take as the …rst principal component of the ASVAB test scores.6 There

11

has been considerable debate about what represents the best measure of
cognitive ability. General intelligence, which re‡ects the ability to perform
well on the tests used to estimate it, is commonly used in psychometrics,
though it is often supplemented with more speci…c ability measures (see, e.g.
the review in Carroll 1997). In Cawley, Conneely, Heckman and Vytlacil
(1997) we show that there is little di¤erence between general intelligence,
(Armed Forces Qualifying Test), or averages of the ASVAB test of the sort
used by Blackburn and Neumark (1993), in terms of explanatory power in log
wage regressions. In parallel analyses of the sort we conduct in this paper,
using the measure employed by Blackburn and Neumark, and for each of the
ASVAB test scores separately, we …nd qualitatively similar results for each
measure with the exception of Paragraph Completion.7
We have already presented our evidence on sorting bias and it is summarized in Table 1. Figure 3 shows that there was a rise in the return to
college education in the mid-80s for white males in the NLSY. However, as
Murnane, Levy and Willet (1995) claim, this may largely be a consequence
of a rise in the return to cognitive ability over time. Figure 4 suggests that
the wage gap between individuals in the upper and lower quartile of ability
rose over this period.
Many hypotheses are consistent with the data, including: a rising return
to education with age, a rising return to ability with age, a rising return
to education with work experience, and a rising return to ability with work
experience.
We address two questions. (1) Is the rising return to education concen12

trated among the most able? We investigate this question using a nonparametric approach. We estimate time e¤ects within education-ability-age cells.
(2) The second question addressed in this paper is whether we need to be so
agnostic about the parameterization of time and age. We test whether the
assumption of linear trends in time and age is justi…ed, so that the simple
methods used in the previous literature can be vindicated. Unfortunately,
they cannot. Relaxing linearity substantially quali…es the interpretation of
interactions previously reported in the literature.
All of our analysis in this section is for white males. Sparse data within
cells prevent us from estimating our nonparametric models for all other
groups. We cannot pool these groups because, as we have shown elsewhere
(Cawley, Conneely, Heckman and Vytlacil, 1997), the wage returns to ability
and education di¤er signi…cantly across race and gender. A cost of adopting
a nonparametric approach is that we are forced to adopt a simpler model,
with fewer regressors, than has typically been estimated in this literature.
We use nonparametric methods to clarify the two stated questions. With a
data set the size of the NLSY, we cannot be fully nonparametric in using the
full array of variables presented in other studies in this literature.

2.1

Is the Return to Ability or Education Rising?

The …rst question we investigate in this section is whether the rising
return to education should be attributed to a rising return to ability. We
present empirical results for the case when ability is divided into quartiles

13

and education is broken down into three categories: high school dropout,
high school graduate, and college graduate. We de…ne these education levels by highest grade completed less than 12, equal to 12, and equal to 16,
respectively. This results in twelve education-ability cells.8
Figure 5 plots the time trends from a speci…cation that does not allow for
age-time interactions. Within each education level, we run a spline regression
of log wage on ability with knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of
ability, where the coe¢cients of the spline regression are allowed to depend
on time and age in an additively separable manner. In particular, letting a
denote age, t denote time, e denote education level, c denote cognitive ability,
and qc denote quartile of cognitive ability, the speci…cation is:
³
´ ³
´
(2.1)
`n w = ®(a; e; qc ) + ¯(t; e; qc ) + °(a; e; qc ) + ±(t; e; qc ) c + ²

where ² is mean independent of the a; t; e and c, and where the regression
equation is constrained to be continuous in the cognitive ability score, c; and
linear in c within the ability quartiles.9 No functional form assumption is
imposed on the coe¢cients besides those required to constrain the equation
to be continuous in c for each age, time and education level. The coe¢cients
may vary with age, time, education, or ability quartile. The plotted point
estimates are …tted values with the ability level evaluated at the midpoint
of each ability quartile.10 The plotted con…dence bands are plus and minus
two standard errors, with the standard errors estimated by a robust EicherWhite procedure allowing for correlation in log wages across time for a given
individual. Because of the strong association between ability and education,
estimates could only be obtained for high school dropouts in the bottom
14

two ability quartiles, high school graduates in all four quartiles, and college
graduates in the top two quartiles. The plots indicate falling wages for men
with less than a college education, and rising wages for college graduates in
the two highest ability quartiles.11
In addition to the additive speci…cation (2.1), we also control for age in
a di¤erent way. We estimate time coe¢cients within each age cell, which
permits interactions between age and time.12 In particular, we estimate the
following spline regression:
(2.2)

`n w = ®(a; t; e; qc ) + °(a; t; e; qc )c + ²

where the regression equation is again constrained to be continuous in the
cognitive ability score, c, within quartiles and no functional form assumption
is imposed on how the coe¢cients vary with age, time or education.13 This
analysis is not without cost; by looking within smaller data cells, we obtain
noisy estimates.
From this analysis, we conclude that the wage premium for college graduation (over high school graduation) rose in the mid-1980s for white males of
the highest g quartile in their mid-20s: Figure 6 presents the most interesting of these estimated wage premia.14 Similar analysis, for the third quartile,
is reported in Figure 7. We …nd no increase in the wage premium for college graduation for those in the third quartile of ability, a result essentially
in agreement with the interaction of education, ability and time reported
in Blackburn and Neumark (1993). Their …nding of an interaction among
ability, education and time is supported but it is isolated in the highest g
quartile group. The e¤ect of ability on the education-time interaction is not
15

continuous. At lower ability or education levels, increases in ability do not
increase the education-time trend.
Figure 7 should be treated very cautiously due to small sample sizes.
There are more than twenty observations in each reported age-time cell for
fourth quartile college graduates and high school graduates, but there are less
than twenty observations in many reported age-time cells for third quartile
college graduates. Insu¢cient data prevent us from performing a parallel
analysis for the bottom two ability quartiles. For the high school graduate high school drop out wage di¤erential, there is little evidence of a rise in the
return to education for the ability cohorts where usable cells are available.15
Among the estimable cells, the rise in the wage di¤erentials among schooling
groups is only found among younger fourth quartile college graduates. In
a parallel analysis that controls for work experience instead of age, we …nd
a signi…cant time trend in the college graduate-high school graduate wage
di¤erential again in the mid 80s but only for workers with the least work
experience.16

2.2

Parameterizing Age and Time E¤ects

The nonparametric stance we take in this paper is very conservative. With
a little additional structure, a clearer story might emerge. The second question considered in this section is whether we need to be fully nonparametric
in age and time. To answer this question we perform a series of tests.17
We …rst test whether time e¤ects are equal across education cells, in

16

particular, in the notation of equation (2.2) whether18
®(a; t + 1; e; qc ) ¡ ®(a; t; e; qc ) = ®(a; t + 1; e0 ; qc ) ¡ ®(a; t; e0 ; qc )
°(a; t + 1; e; qc ) ¡ °(a; t; e; qc ) = °(a; t + 1; e0 ; qc ) ¡ °(a; t; e0 ; qc )
for all available (a; t; qc ; e), (a; t; qc ; e0 ) cells with e 6= e0 . We also test whether
time e¤ects are equal across ability quartiles, and whether age e¤ects are
equal across education and ability cells. We reject each of these four hypotheses, which implies that age and time e¤ects should be estimated within
education-ability cells.19
Next, within each education-ability cell, we test whether all identi…ed agetime interactions are zero. In particular, we conduct a score test with the
unrestricted model given by equation (2.2) and the restricted model given
by equation (2.1). We reject the hypothesis of zero age-time interactions.
Combining the inferences from these tests, we conclude that in order to test
for the linearity of time e¤ects we must condition on age, and to test for
linearity of age e¤ects we must condition on time. We follow this strategy.
Speci…cally, for each age, we consider whether the age-speci…c time trend is
linear for each ability-education-age cell with data. The same approach is
used for testing whether the time-speci…c age trend is linear.20 We reject
the hypothesis that time e¤ects are linear across education-ability-age cells
and that age e¤ects are linear across education-ability-time cells. From this
entire series of tests, we conclude that there is no empirical justi…cation for
the widespread practice of assuming that the e¤ects of time and age are
17

linear.21
At the beginning of this section, we asked two questions. The …rst was:
how should attribution for the wage gain be divided between education and
ability? We have shown that education and cognitive ability are so strongly
associated that the wage e¤ects of the two cannot be separated for all groups.
This is a consequence of the problem of sorting bias previously discussed. We
…nd that the college graduate-high school graduate wage di¤erential rose in
the mid-80s for those in the highest quartile of ability but only for young
workers, (those with the least amount of work experience). High school
graduate-high school dropout wage di¤erentials are stagnant over time for
the lowest two quartiles of ability whether age or experience is used to control
for life cycle wage growth.
The second question asked was: do we need to be nonparametric when
estimating the e¤ects of age and time? The answer is yes. We …nd no
support for the widely accepted practice in the empirical literature of solving
the identi…cation problems posed in Section 1 by imposing linear e¤ects of
time and age. When this assumption is relaxed, we …nd that an educationability-time interaction only holds for high ability college graduates.

Conclusions
This paper examines the role of ability in accounting for the recent rise in

the economic return to education. Estimates of this e¤ect are often obtained
from panel data sets that follow a small range of birth cohorts over time.
18

The design of these data sets creates a serious identi…cation problem that
di¤erent authors cope with in di¤erent ways.22
In addition to the identi…cation problems raised by the panel structure
of the data used to isolate the e¤ect of ability, there is additional strati…cation of persons by ability into schooling strata. This gives rise to the
problem of sorting bias which is logically prior to the problem of ability bias
that has occupied the attention of empirical labor economists. If ability and
education are perfectly strati…ed, separate e¤ects of ability or schooling on
earnings cannot be identi…ed. With the levels of strati…cation in Table 1, separate ability and education e¤ects are estimable only by imposing arbitrary
parametric assumptions like linearity in age and education in an earnings
equation. In the literature, the ability bias problem is usually formulated as
a problem of omitted variables. The evidence reported in this paper suggests
that the real problem is that ability and schooling appear to be inseparable
— all interaction and no main e¤ects — even if ability is perfectly observed.
Sorting bias creates empty cells which compound the usual problems of identifying interactions. Di¤erent strategies for coping with these problems have
led to di¤erent interpretations of the role of ability in explaining the rising
return to schooling. It would be fruitful to conduct additional investigations
of sorting bias for data from earlier periods. Herrnstein and Murray (1994)
claim that strong sorting of ability and education is a recent phenomenon.
We show that a common method of “solving” the identi…cation problem,
assuming linear e¤ects of age and time, is not supported by the NLSY data.
We present nonparametric estimates of the identi…ed parameters in the data.
19

We …nd evidence that, within age groups, the college-high school premium
has increased in the mid 1980s for young persons of the fourth quartile of
ability but not for young persons in the third quartile of ability. Because of
the strong sorting of ability by schooling, the college-high school di¤erential
cannot be identi…ed for other quartiles and the estimated pattern is very
fragile for the third quartile of ability. When the strati…cation is made on
the basis of measured work experience, there is mild evidence of an increase
in the college-high school wage di¤erential for the most able men with low
levels of work experience. Few sturdy conclusions emerge about ability and
its e¤ect on the trend in the return to education for other groups.

Notes
1

The evidence reported in Table 1 may be called into question because

education may increase ability. However, the level of sorting (as reported in
Table 1) is only slightly weaker if we consider only 14-16 year olds in 1979
in the NLSY whose ability is measured before they complete their schooling.
This table is available on request from the authors.

See the essays in Mason and Fienberg (1983) for discussions of the clas-

sical age-period-cohort e¤ect problem.
3

Cawley, Heckman, Lochner and Vytlacil (1999) summarize the literature

and demonstrate the sensitivity of estimates of ability-education-time e¤ects
to exclusion and inclusion of other variables, and suppression of certain interactions.
4

A similar identi…cation strategy entails normalizing ¯(1) = 0, and sub-

sequently identifying ®(1) and the rest of the main e¤ects.
5

See e.g. Searle (1987).

6

Because age at the time of test in‡uences test performance, we standard-

ize each of the ASVAB subtests to mean zero and variance one by age. We
calculate g as the …rst principal component of the standardized test scores.
For a more complete description of our measure of g and its characteristics,
see Cawley, Conneely, Heckman and Vytlacil (1997).
7

When using Paragraph Completion as the measure of ability, we found
24

the time trends in the return to education to be qualitatively the same in the
third and fourth quartiles and could not reject the hypothesis that the time
trends were the same.
8

We choose these divisions because they achieve a balance between dif-

ferentiating ability and education groups while still retaining enough observations in each cell to generate meaningful estimates.
9

Experimentation with higher order splines produced similar though nois-

ier empirical results.
10

Similar results are obtained using medians within quartiles.

11

Our estimate of rising wages college educated individuals in the third

quartile of ability is fragile to the speci…cation used. The rising wage in
the third quartile for college graduates is not found with the alternative
speci…cation which conditions on ability quartile instead of using the linear
spline speci…cation. These results are available from the authors on request.
12

The e¤ects of these two methods of “controlling” for a variable are often

confused in the literature, but only under the null hypothesis of no interactions between age and time are the two methods equivalent.
13

Use of higher order splines within ability quartiles does not a¤ect the

estimates.

ability cells, we estimate equation (2.2) unrestricted and run a Wald test of
the given linear restrictions on the model.

For the linearity tests, we estimate equation (2.2) unrestricted and run

a Wald test of the appropriate linear restrictions on the model.

22

Cawley, Heckman, Lochner and Vytlacil (1999) demonstrate that small

changes in conventional speci…cations (adding and suppressing interactions
based on linear measures of age and time) produce very di¤erent estimates
of age - period - education e¤ects on wages.

Appendix A: Data
This paper uses the data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(NLSY). The NLSY, designed to represent the entire population of American
youth, consists of a randomly chosen sample of 6,111 U.S. civilian youths,
a supplemental sample of 5,295 randomly chosen minority and economically
disadvantaged civilian youths, and a sample of 1,280 youths on active duty
in the military. All youths were between fourteen and twenty-two years of
age when the …rst of annual interviews was conducted in 1979. The data
set includes equal numbers of males and females. 16% of respondents are
Hispanic and 25% are black. For our analysis, we restricted the sample to
those not currently enrolled in school and receiving an hourly wage between
$.50 and $1000 in 1990 dollars (all results of this paper are reported in 1990
dollars). Parallel analysis using $1 and $100 as the cut-o¤ points resulted in
similar results. This paper uses the NLSY weights for each year to produce
a nationally representative sample. However, our sample is not nationally
representative in age; we only observe a nine year range of ages in any given
year, and the oldest person in our 1994 sample is only 37.
In 1980, NLSY respondents were administered a battery of ten intelligence tests referred to as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery
(ASVAB). Table 2 lists the ten tests. See Cawley, Conneely, Heckman and
Vytlacil (1997) for a more complete description.

Appendix B: Identifying Interactions In Incomplete Data
This appendix presents a formal analysis of identi…cation of interactions
when there are missing cells. First, we de…ne unconditional and conditional
main time and age e¤ects. Second, we describe the identi…ed combinations
of interactions in the presence of incomplete data with a pattern illustrated
in Figure 2. Assume A age groups and T time periods.
The problem of empty o¤-diagonal cells restricts what can be learned in
two major ways. First, it prevents identi…cation of unconditional main time
and age e¤ects. Let E(`n w(a; t)) = ¹(a; t). Unconditional main e¤ects are
de…ned as
®(a) =

1
T

¯(t) =

1
A

and

PT

t=1

PA

a=1

¹(a; t);

a = 1; :::; A

¹(a; t);

t = 1; :::; T .

Since we lack the data for every time and age, which are required to form
these sums, we cannot identify these parameters.
Without invoking further assumptions, we can only identify main time
e¤ects conditional on the ages observed. Assume that A¹ ages are observed
in each time period t, i.e. there are A¹ cohorts in the panel. For any t, the
youngest and oldest ages observed in any year are Af (t) = t and A` (t) =
t + A¹ ¡ 1.
The conditional main time e¤ect is:
28

¯(t; Af (t); A` (t)) =

1
¹
A

equivalently,
¯(t; Af (t); A` (t)) = ¯(t) +

1
¹
A

PA` (t)

a=Af (t)

PA` (t)

¹(a; t)

a=Af (t) (®(a)

+ °(a; t)).

Estimated time e¤ects obtained by summing over available ages depend on
the interactions over the interval [Af (t); A` (t)].
Similarly, without making further assumptions, we can only identify the
main age e¤ect conditional on times observed. Let Tf (a) and T` (a) represent
the …rst and last years that age a is sampled. The conditional main age e¤ect
is:

T` (a)
X
1
®(a; Tf (a); T` (a)) =
¹(a; t)
1 + T` (a) ¡ Tf (a)
t=Tf (a)

equivalently,
T` (a)
X
1
(¯(t) + °(a; t)):
®(a; Tf (a); T` (a)) = ®(a) +
1 + T` (a) ¡ Tf (a)
t=Tf (a)

Estimated age e¤ects obtained by summing over available times depend on
the interactions over the interval [Tf (a); T` (a)].
Tf (a) and T` (a) can easily be related to the other parameters. Let T
equal the latest date in the panel which is also the oldest age. If every birth
cohort in the panel is observed passing through age a (i.e. A¹ · a · T ), then
age a is in the interior of the panel and Tf (a) = a ¡ (A¹ ¡ 1) and T` (a) = a.

If not every birth cohort in the panel is observed passing through age a,
then age a is on the border of the panel. This is the case if a < A¹ or if
29

a > T . For ages on the border of the panel, Tf (a) = maxf1; a ¡ (A¹ ¡ 1)g
and T` (a) = minfa; T g.
The second major e¤ect of empty data cells is to limit the number of
identi…able interactions. In a complete table, T (T + (A¹ ¡ 1)) cells are de…ned
¹ are observed. For each t, only the cells (t; a = t); :::; (t; a =
but only AT

t + A¹ ¡ 1) on or near the diagonal are observed in the panel structure.
In principle, no interaction for a (t; a) pair with width jt ¡ aj > A¹ can be

nonparametrically identi…ed; i.e. only interactions associated with nonempty
data cells can be identi…ed. If only one age cohort is observed (i.e. A¹ =
1, as in Figure 1), no main e¤ects or interactions are identi…ed; they are
hopelessly confounded as the single age cohort simultaneously ages and enters
a new economic environment. For A¹ = 2, all main e¤ects are identi…ed if
all interactions are assumed to be zero. For A¹ ¸ 3, certain combinations of
the interactions are identi…ed without assuming zero interactions. Individual
interactions cannot be identi…ed.
The absence of identi…able interactions outside the blackened band displayed in Figure 2 means that any test for the absence of interactions is
actually a test that linear combinations of the identi…ed interactions are
zero. More precisely, we can always identify the combination of interactions

[°(a; t) ¡ °(a; t0 )] ¡ [°(a0 ; t) ¡ °(a0 ; t0 )]
¹ for
for the set of all pairs ((t; a); (t0 ; a0 )) 2 f(t; a); (t0 ; a0 ) j ` · a; a0 · ` + A;
` = t; t0 ; t; t0 = 1; :::; T g. The di¤erence within brackets removes the common
30

additive age e¤ect and the di¤erence in di¤erences removes the common
additive time e¤ect. One can then test whether the residuals for the set of
all pairs ((t; a); (t0 ; a0 )) jointly equal zero.

Notes:
1) Here, ability is defined as general intelligence, or ‘g’. We compute ‘g’ as the ASVAB test score vector times the
eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue in the test score covariance matrix.
2) Sample includes all respondents who were employed, out-of-school, and had valid observations each year from
age 24 to age 30. Anyone receiving more schooling after age 30 was excluded.
