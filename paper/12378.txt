JEL No. G11, G12
ABSTRACT
We review a recent approach to understanding the equity premium puzzle. The key elements of this
approach are loss aversion and narrow framing, two well-known features of decision-making under
risk in experimental settings. In equilibrium, models that incorporate these ideas can generate a large
equity premium and a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption growth is smooth and
only weakly correlated with the stock market. Moreover, they can do so for parameter values that
correspond to sensible attitudes to independent monetary gambles. We conclude by suggesting some
possible directions for future research.

Introduction

One of the best-known stock market puzzles is the equity premium puzzle, which asks why
stocks historically earned a higher average return, relative to T-Bills, than seems justiﬁed
by standard measures of risk (Mehra and Prescott, 1985). In this essay, we discuss a recent
approach to addressing this puzzle. The broad theme of this approach is that we may be
able to improve our understanding of how people evaluate stock market risk, and hence our
understanding of the equity premium, by looking at how people evaluate risk in experimental
settings. Speciﬁcally, this approach argues that loss aversion and narrow framing, two of the
most important ideas to emerge from the experimental literature on decision-making under
risk, may play an important role in the way some people think about the stock market.
Loss aversion is a central feature of Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory –
a descriptive theory, based on extensive experimental evidence, of how people evaluate risk.
In this theory, the carriers of value are not absolute levels of wealth, but rather, gains and
losses measured relative to a reference point. Loss aversion is the ﬁnding that people are
much more sensitive to losses – even small losses – than to gains of the same magnitude.
To understand narrow framing, recall that under traditional utility functions deﬁned
over consumption or total wealth, the agent evaluates a new gamble by ﬁrst mixing it with
the other risks he is already facing and then checking whether the combination is attractive. Narrow framing, by contrast, is the phenomenon documented in experimental settings
whereby, when people are oﬀered a new gamble, they sometimes evaluate it in isolation,
separately from their other risks. In other words, they act as if they get utility directly from
the outcome of the gamble, even if the gamble is just one of many that determine their
overall wealth risk. This behavior is at odds with traditional utility functions, under which
the agent only gets utility from the outcome of a new gamble indirectly, via its contribution
to his total wealth.
Motivated by these ideas, some recent papers propose that people are loss averse over
changes in the value of their stock market holdings. In other words, even if stock market risk
is just one of many risks that determine their overall wealth risk – others being labor income
risk and housing risk, say – people still get utility directly from stock market ﬂuctuations
(narrow framing) and are more sensitive to losses than to gains (loss aversion). For reasons
we discuss below, most implementations also assume that people focus on annual gains and
losses. Informally, then, people evaluate stock market risk by saying: “Well, stocks could
go up over the next year, and that would feel good; but they could also go down, and since
I’m more sensitive to losses than to gains, that would be really painful. Overall, the stock
market doesn’t look like an attractive risk to me.” According to the approach we describe
in this essay, it is this sort of thinking that leads the investing population to demand a high
equity premium.
2

Why should economists be interested in this particular approach to the equity premium
puzzle? What are its selling points? In this survey, we emphasize two. First, a model that
incorporates loss aversion and narrow framing can generate a high equity premium while
also matching other aspects of the data, such as the low and stable risk-free rate, the low
volatility of consumption growth, and the low correlation of stock returns and consumption
growth. With some additional structure, it can also match the high volatility and time-series
predictability of stock returns.
A second beneﬁt of the framework described here is that it can address the equity premium puzzle for preference parameters that are “reasonable,” by which we mean parameters
that correspond to sensible attitudes to independent monetary gambles. This is important
because it was, in part, the diﬃculty researchers encountered in reconciling the high average
return on stocks with reasonable attitudes to large-scale monetary gambles that launched
the equity premium literature in the ﬁrst place.
The approach we survey here was ﬁrst proposed by Benartzi and Thaler (1995). In
their framework, the investor is loss averse over ﬂuctuations in the value of his ﬁnancial
wealth, which, since ﬁnancial wealth is just one component of total wealth, constitutes
narrow framing. One drawback of this framework is that, since the investor gets no direct
utility at all from consumption or total wealth, consumption plays no role, making it hard
to check how well the model describes the joint properties of stock returns and consumption
growth.
Benartzi and Thaler’s work therefore opens up a new challenge: to build and evaluate
more realistic models in which, even if the investor gets utility from ﬂuctuations in the value
of one component of his wealth, he also gets some utility from consumption. In large part,
this essay surveys the progress that has been made on this front, drawing primarily on the
analysis of Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) and Barberis and Huang (2004).
The story we tell in this essay is a simple one: investors require a high equity premium
because any drop in the stock market over the next year will bring them direct disutility.
To some readers, this story may be too simple, in that the distance between assumption and
conclusion may appear too close for comfort. We are aware of this concern and agree that
if the loss aversion / narrow framing framework is to gain currency, its predictions must be
tested and conﬁrmed. Fortunately, tests of the framework are starting to appear, and we
discuss some of them at the end of the essay. Even before the outcome of these tests is
known, however, there is a methodological contribution in the research surveyed here that
even a skeptical reader can appreciate: the papers we discuss show how loss aversion and
narrow framing can be incorporated into more traditional models of asset pricing, thereby
helping us understand the predictions of these features of decision-making.
In Section 2, we discuss loss aversion and narrow framing in more detail, examining both
3

the evidence they are inferred from and the interpretations they are given. In Section 3, we
show that, once embedded into more traditional utility functions, these features can generate
a high equity premium and a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption growth
is smooth and only weakly correlated with stock returns; and moreover, that they can do
so for parameter values that correspond to sensible attitudes to both large-scale and smallscale monetary gambles. We highlight the importance of the narrow framing assumption by
showing that, without this feature, the results are very diﬀerent. In Section 4, we note that
the analysis also has implications for a portfolio puzzle, the stock market participation puzzle.
Section 5 considers various extensions of the basic framework, while Section 6 concludes and
discusses possible directions for future research.
Since loss aversion and narrow framing are the deﬁning features of the approach we
describe here, the framework should, strictly speaking, be called the “loss aversion and
narrow framing” approach to the equity premium puzzle. Given that narrow framing is
the more distinctive of the two ingredients, we sometimes abbreviate this to the “narrow
framing” approach.1

Loss Aversion and Narrow Framing

Loss aversion is a central feature of Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory, a
prominent descriptive theory of decision-making under risk. In this theory, the carriers of
value are not absolute wealth levels, but rather, gains and losses measured relative to a
reference point. Loss aversion is a greater sensitivity to losses – even small losses – than to
gains of the same magnitude, and is represented by a kink in the utility function.
The most basic evidence for loss aversion is the fact that people tend to reject gambles
of the form
1

(1)
(110, ; −100, ),

to be read as “win $110 with probability 12 , lose $100 with probability 12 , independent of
other risks” (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). It is hard to
explain this evidence with diﬀerentiable utility functions, whether expected utility or nonexpected utility, because the very high local risk aversion required to do so typically predicts
an implausibly high level of aversion to large-scale gambles (Epstein and Zin, 1990, Rabin,
2000, Barberis, Huang, and Thaler, 2006).2

Benartzi and Thaler (1995) use the label “myopic loss aversion”. By using this phrase, they emphasize
the investor’s sensitivity to losses (loss aversion) and his focus on annual gains and losses (myopia), but not
the narrow framing. As we will see, narrow framing is more crucial to the results than the annual evaluation
of gains and losses. We therefore prefer to emphasize the narrow framing while playing down the myopia.
2
There is also strong evidence of what Thaler (1980) calls an “endowment eﬀect,” which can be thought

4

For reasons of tractability, the asset pricing models we describe later do not incorporate
all features of prospect theory. However, even if it were possible to solve a dynamic asset
pricing model that did incorporate all of prospect theory’s features, we would not expect the
implications for the equity premium to be very diﬀerent. Under prospect theory, attitudes
to a gamble like the stock market, which entails a moderate probability of a gain or of a loss,
are largely determined by loss aversion alone.3
The classic demonstration of narrow framing is due to Tversky and Kahneman (1981),
who ask 150 subjects the following question:
Imagine that you face the following pair of concurrent decisions. First examine both decisions, then indicate the options you prefer:
Choice (I) Choose between:
A. a sure gain of $240
B. 25% chance to gain $1,000 and 75% chance to gain nothing
Choice (II) Choose between:
C. a sure loss of $750
D. 75% chance to lose $1,000 and 25% chance to lose nothing.
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) report that 84% of subjects chose A, with only 16%
choosing B, and that 87% chose D, with only 13% choosing C. In particular, 73% of subjects
chose the combination A&D, namely
25% chance to win $240,

75% chance to lose $760,

(2)

which is surprising, given that this choice is dominated by the combination B&C, namely
25% chance to win $250,

75% chance to lose $750.

(3)

It appears that instead of focussing on the combined outcome of decisions I and II – in other
words, on the outcome that determines their ﬁnal wealth – subjects are focussing on the
of as loss aversion in the absence of uncertainty. Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1990) conduct a series
of experiments in which subjects are either given some object such as a coﬀee mug and then asked if they
would be willing to sell it, or not given a mug and then oﬀered the chance to buy one. The authors ﬁnd that
mug owners demand more than twice as much to sell their mugs as non-owners are willing to pay to acquire
one.
3
The asset pricing implications of other features of prospect theory are studied, in simple settings, by
Barberis and Huang (2005), who focus on the probability weighting function; and by Barberis and Xiong
(2005) and Gomes (2005), who focus on the concavity (convexity) of the value function over gains (losses).

5

outcome of each decision separately. Indeed, subjects who are asked only about decision I
do overwhelmingly choose A; and subjects asked only about decision II do overwhelmingly
choose D.
In more formal terms, it appears that we cannot model the typical subject as maximizing
a utility function deﬁned only over total wealth. Rather, his utility function appears to
depend directly on the outcome of each of decisions I and II, rather than just indirectly, via
the contribution of each decision to overall wealth. As such, this is an example of narrow
framing.
More recently, Barberis, Huang, and Thaler (2006) have argued that the commonly
observed rejection of the gamble in (1) is not only evidence of loss aversion, but of narrow
framing as well. To see why, note that most of the subjects who are oﬀered this gamble
are typically already facing other kinds of risk, such as labor income risk, housing risk, or
ﬁnancial market risk. In the absence of narrow framing, they must therefore evaluate the
110/100 gamble by mixing it with these other risks and then checking if the combination is
attractive. It turns out that the combination is almost always attractive: since the 110/100
gamble is independent of other risks, it oﬀers useful diversiﬁcation beneﬁts, which, even if
loss averse, people can enjoy. The rejection of the 110/100 gamble therefore suggests that
people are not fully merging the gamble with their other risks, but that, to some extent,
they are evaluating it in isolation; in other words, that they are framing it narrowly.
By the same token, any evidence of aversion to a small, independent, actuarially favorable
risk points to a possible role for narrow framing. Examples of such evidence in the ﬁeld are the
high premia consumers pay for telephone wiring insurance and the low deductibles chosen in
automobile insurance contracts (Cicchetti and Dubin, 1994, Rabin and Thaler, 2001, Cohen
and Einav, 2005).4
Motivated by these ideas, some recent papers propose that people are loss averse over
changes in the value of their stock market holdings. In other words, even if stock market risk
is just one of many risks that determine their overall wealth risk – others being labor income
risk and housing risk, say – people still get utility directly from stock market ﬂuctuations
(narrow framing) and are more sensitive to losses than to gains (loss aversion).
Is it plausible that people might frame stock market risk narrowly? To answer this, it
is helpful to ﬁrst think about the underlying sources of narrow framing. One view is that
narrow framing stems from non-consumption utility, such as regret. Regret is the pain we
feel when we realize that we would be better oﬀ today if we had taken a diﬀerent action in
the past. Even if a gamble that an agent accepts is just one of many risks that he faces, it
4

For more discussion and evidence of narrow framing, see Kahneman and Tversky (1983), Tversky and
Kahneman (1986), Redelmeier and Tversky (1992), Kahneman and Lovallo (1993), and Read, Lowenstein,
and Rabin (2000).

is still linked to a speciﬁc decision, namely the decision to accept the gamble. As a result,
it exposes the agent to possible future regret: if the gamble turns out badly, he may regret
the decision to accept it. Consideration of non-consumption utility therefore leads quite
naturally to preferences that depend directly on the outcomes of speciﬁc gambles the agent
faces.
A second interpretation of narrow framing is proposed by Kahneman (2003). He argues
that it occurs when decisions are made intuitively, rather than through eﬀortful reasoning.
Since intuitive thoughts are by nature spontaneous, they are heavily shaped by the features
of the situation at hand that come to mind most easily; to use the technical term, by the
features that are most “accessible.” When an agent is oﬀered a new gamble, the distribution
of the gamble, considered separately, is much more accessible than the distribution of his
overall wealth once the new gamble has been merged with his other risks. As a result, if
the agent thinks about the gamble intuitively, the distribution of the gamble, taken alone,
may play a more important role in decision-making than would be predicted by traditional
utility functions deﬁned only over wealth or consumption.
In Tversky and Kahneman’s (1981) example, the outcome of each one of choices A, B,
C, or D is highly accessible. Much less accessible, though, is the overall outcome once
two choices – A&D, say, or B&C – are combined: the distributions in (2) and (3) are less
“obvious” than the distributions of A, B, C, and D given in the original question. As a
result, the outcome of each of decisions I and II may play a bigger role in decision-making
than predicted by traditional utility functions. Similar reasoning applies in the case of the
110/100 gamble.
It seems to us that both the “regret” and “accessibility” interpretations of narrow framing
could be relevant when investors – even sophisticated investors – think about stock market
risk. Allocating some fraction of his wealth to the stock market constitutes a speciﬁc action
on the part of the agent – one that he may later regret if his stock market gamble turns
out poorly.5 Alternatively, given our daily exposure, through newspapers, books, and other
media, to large amounts of information about the distribution of stock market risk, such
information is very accessible. Much less accessible is information about the distribution
of future outcomes once stock risk is merged with the other kinds of risk that people face.
Judgments about how much to invest in stocks might therefore be made, at least in part,
using a narrow frame.
The accessibility interpretation of narrow framing also provides a rationale for why in5

Of course, investing in T-Bills may also lead to regret if the stock market goes up in the meantime.
Regret is thought to be stronger, however, when it stems from having taken an action – for example, actively
moving one’s savings from the default option of a riskless bank account to the stock market – than from
having not taken an action – for example, leaving one’s savings in place at the bank. In short, errors of
commission are more painful than errors of omission (Kahneman and Tversky, 1982).

vestors might focus on annual gains and losses in the stock market. Much of the public
discussion about the historical performance of diﬀerent asset classes is couched in terms of
annual returns, making the annual return distribution particularly accessible.6
While Tversky and Kahneman’s (1981) experiment provides conclusive evidence of narrow framing, it is also somewhat extreme, in that, in this example, narrow framing leads
subjects to choose a dominated alternative. In general, narrow framing does not necessarily
lead to violations of dominance. All the same, Tversky and Kahneman’s (1981) example
does raise the concern that, when applied to asset pricing, narrow framing might give rise
to arbitrage opportunities. To ensure that this does not happen, the analysis in Section 3
focusses on applications to absolute pricing – in other words, to the pricing of assets, like the
aggregate stock market, which lack perfect substitutes. Since the substitutes are imperfect,
there are no riskless arbitrage opportunities in the economies we construct. We would not
expect narrow framing to have much useful application to relative pricing: in this case, any
impact that narrow framing had on prices would create an arbitrage opportunity that could
be quickly exploited.
While the regret and accessibility interpretations both suggest that narrow framing may
play a role when people evaluate stock market risk, they make diﬀerent predictions as to how
long-lasting this role will be. Under the regret interpretation, the agent simply gets utility
from things other than consumption, and takes this into account when making decisions.
Since he is acting optimally, there is no reason to expect his behavior to change over time.
Narrow framing is therefore likely to be a permanent feature of preferences, and if it leads
the agent to demand a high equity premium today, then it will lead him to demand a high
equity premium in the future as well.
Suppose, however, that narrow framing instead stems from intuitive thinking and from
basing decisions only on “accessible” information. In this case, the agent would be happier
with a diﬀerent decision rule, but has failed to go through the eﬀortful reasoning required to
uncover that rule. We would therefore expect the agent’s behavior to change over time, as
he learns that his intuitive thinking is leading him astray, and either through his own eﬀorts,
or by observing the actions of others, discovers a better decision rule. If accessibility-based
6

Clever tests of this logic can be found in Gneezy and Potters (1997) and Thaler et al. (1997). The latter
paper, for example, asks subjects how they would allocate between a risk-free asset and a risky asset over a
long time horizon such as 30 years. The key manipulation is that some subjects are shown draws from the
distribution of asset returns over short horizons – the distribution of monthly returns, say – while others are
shown draws from a long-term return distribution – the distribution of 30-year returns, say. Since they have
the same decision problem, the two groups of subjects should make similar allocation decisions: subjects who
see short-term returns should simply use them to infer the more directly relevant long-term returns. In fact,
these subjects allocate substantially less to the risky asset, suggesting that they are simply falling back on
the returns that are most accessible to them, namely the short-term returns they were shown. Since losses
occur more often in high frequency data, they perceive the risky asset to be especially risky and allocate less
to it.

8

narrow framing is driving the equity premium, we would expect the premium to fall over
time as investors gradually switch away from narrow framing.
Our discussion has treated loss aversion and narrow framing as two distinct phenomena.
Recent work, however, suggests that they may form a natural pair, because in those situations
where people exhibit loss aversion, they often also exhibit narrow framing. For example, as
noted above, the rejection of the 110/100 gamble in (1) points not only to loss aversion, but
to narrow framing as well.
Kahneman (2003) suggests an explanation for why loss aversion and narrow framing
might appear in combination like this. He argues that prospect theory captures the way
people act when making decisions intuitively, rather than through eﬀortful reasoning. Since
narrow framing is also thought to derive, at least in part, from intuitive decision-making, it
is natural that prospect theory, and therefore also loss aversion, would be used in parallel
with narrow framing.

The Equity Premium

In this section, we discuss various ways of modeling loss aversion and narrow framing, and
then demonstrate the advantages, from the perspective of addressing the equity premium
puzzle, of a model which incorporates these features of decision-making. Speciﬁcally, in
Section 3.2, we show that such a model can generate a high equity premium at the same
time as a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption growth is smooth and only
weakly correlated with stock returns; and then, in Section 3.3, that it can do so for preference
parameters that correspond to reasonable attitudes to large-scale monetary gambles.

3.1

Modeling loss aversion and narrow framing

Benartzi and Thaler (1995) are the ﬁrst to apply loss aversion and narrow framing in the
context of the aggregate stock market. They consider an investor who is loss averse over
changes in the value of his ﬁnancial wealth, deﬁned here as holdings of T-Bills and stocks.
Since ﬁnancial wealth is just one component of overall wealth – others being human capital
and housing wealth – deﬁning utility directly over ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial wealth constitutes
narrow framing.
Benartzi and Thaler (1995) argue that, in equilibrium, their investor charges a high
equity premium. The reason is that the high volatility of stock returns leads to substantial
volatility in returns on ﬁnancial wealth. Given that he is more sensitive to losses than to
gains, these ﬂuctuations in his ﬁnancial wealth cause the investor substantial discomfort. As
9

a result, he only holds the market supply of stocks if compensated by a high average return.
A weakness of Benartzi and Thaler’s (1995) framework is that, since the investor gets
direct utility only from changes in the value of his ﬁnancial wealth, and none at all from
consumption or total wealth, consumption plays no role, making it hard to check how well the
model describes the joint properties of stock returns and consumption growth. An important
challenge therefore remains: to build and evaluate a more realistic model in which, even if
the investor gets utility from ﬂuctuations in the value of one component of his wealth, he
also gets some utility from consumption.
Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) take up this challenge. Before presenting their
speciﬁcation, we introduce the basic economic structure that will apply throughout our
essay. At time t, the investor, whose wealth is denoted Wt , chooses a consumption level
Ct and allocates his post-consumption wealth, Wt − Ct , across three assets. The ﬁrst asset
is risk-free, and earns a gross return of Rf,t between t and t + 1. The second asset is the
stock market, which earns a gross return of RS,t+1 over the same interval, and the third is a
non-ﬁnancial asset, such as human capital or housing wealth, which earns a gross return of
RN,t+1 . The investor’s wealth therefore evolves according to
Wt+1 = (Wt − Ct )((1 − θS,t − θN,t )Rf,t + θS,t RS,t+1 + θN,t RN,t+1 ) ≡ (Wt − Ct )RW,t+1 ,

(4)

where θS,t (θN,t ) is the fraction of post-consumption wealth allocated to the stock market
(the non-ﬁnancial asset) and RW,t+1 is the gross return on wealth between t and t + 1.
A stripped-down version of Barberis, Huang, and Santos’ (2001) framework can be written
as follows. The investor maximizes

(7)

and where C t is aggregate per-capita consumption.
The ﬁrst term inside the parenthesis in (5) ensures that, as in traditional models, the
investor gets utility directly from consumption. Consumption utility takes the standard,
time-additive, power form analyzed by Mehra and Prescott (1985). The parameter β is the
time discount factor, while γ > 0 controls the curvature of the utility function.
The second term introduces narrow framing and loss aversion. The variable GS,t+1 is
the change in the value of the investor’s stock market holdings, computed as stock market
10

wealth at time t, θS,t (Wt −Ct ), multiplied by the net stock market return, RS,t+1 −1; v(GS,t+1 )
represents utility from this change in value. Narrow framing is therefore introduced by letting
the agent get utility directly from changes in the value of just one component of his total
wealth, with b0 controlling the degree of narrow framing. Loss aversion is introduced via
the piecewise linear form of v(·), which makes the investor more sensitive to declines in
−γ
stock market value than to increases. Finally, C t is a neutral scaling term that ensures
stationarity in equilibrium.
Equation (6) is the simplest way of specifying the stock market “gains” and “losses” that
the investor is loss averse over. Here, so long as θS,t > 0, a positive net return is considered
a gain and, from (7), is assigned positive utility; a negative net return is considered a loss
and is assigned negative utility. Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) work primarily with
another, possibly more realistic formulation,
GS,t+1 = θS,t (Wt − Ct )(RS,t+1 − Rf,t ),

(8)

in which a stock market return is only considered a gain, and hence is only assigned positive
utility, if it exceeds the risk-free rate.
In Section 2, we noted that even though narrow framing has mainly been documented
in experimental settings, both the “regret” and “accessibility” interpretations suggest that
people may frame the stock market narrowly as well. One could argue that they also suggest
that people will frame their non-ﬁnancial assets narrowly: for example, on the grounds that
the distribution of those assets’ returns is also very accessible. The speciﬁcation in (5) can
certainly accommodate such behavior, but we have found that doing so has little eﬀect on
our results. For simplicity, then, we assume that only stock market risk is framed narrowly.
The preferences in (5) are a simpliﬁed version of Barberis, Huang, and Santos’ (2001)
speciﬁcation. In an eﬀort to understand not only the equity premium, but also the volatility
and time-series predictability of stock returns, their original model captures not only loss
aversion, but also some dynamic evidence on loss aversion, sometimes known as the “house
money” eﬀect, whereby prior gains and losses aﬀect current sensitivity to losses. The speciﬁcation in (5) strips out this dynamic eﬀect, leaving only the core features of loss aversion
and narrow framing. We discuss the full model in Section 5.7
The ﬁrst-order conditions of optimality for the preferences in (5), (7), and (8) can be
derived using straightforward perturbation arguments. They are:
⎡

C t+1
1 = βRf,t Et ⎣

Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) also consider the case in which the investor gets utility from changes
in total wealth, rather than in stock market wealth, so that there is no narrow framing.

(10)

When there is no narrow framing, so that b0 = 0, these equations reduce to those derived
from a standard asset pricing model with time-additive power utility over consumption, such
as that of Mehra and Prescott (1985). Introducing narrow framing, so that b0 > 0, has no
eﬀect on the ﬁrst-order condition for the risk-free rate, condition (9): consuming a little less
today and investing the savings in the risk-free rate does not change the investor’s exposure
to losses in the stock market. Narrow framing does, however, introduce a second term in the
ﬁrst-order condition for the stock market, condition (10): consuming less today and investing
the proceeds in the stock market exposes the investor to potentially greater disutility from
a drop in the stock market.
Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) assign the preferences in (5), (7), and (8) to the
representative agent in a simple endowment economy, and, using conditions (9)-(10), show
that, when the model is calibrated to annual data, the narrow framing term can generate
a substantial equity premium and a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption
growth is smooth and only weakly correlated with stock returns. Much as in Benartzi and
Thaler (1995), the intuition is that, since the investor gets direct utility from changes in the
value of his stock market holdings, and is more sensitive to losses than to gains, he perceives
the stock market to be very risky and only holds the market supply if compensated by a
high average return.
Of course, in assigning the utility function in (5) to a representative agent, Barberis,
Huang, and Santos (2001) are assuming that the key features of these preferences survive
aggregation. Intuitively, if all investors are loss averse over annual ﬂuctuations in stock
market wealth, it is hard to see why this would “wash out” in the aggregate. However, this
point has not yet been formalized.
While the preference speciﬁcation in (5) yields a number of insights, it also has some
limitations. First, it does not admit an explicit value function. This makes it hard to
compute attitudes to independent monetary gambles, and therefore to check whether the
preference parameters (γ, λ, b0 ) used to generate a high equity premium are reasonable or
not. Second, the preferences in (5) are intractable in partial equilibrium settings, and so
cannot be used to investigate the implications of narrow framing for portfolio choice. Finally,
to ensure stationarity, the narrow framing component has to be scaled by an ad-hoc factor
based on aggregate consumption.
Recently, Barberis and Huang (2004) have proposed a new preference speciﬁcation that
overcomes these limitations. Their starting point is a non-expected utility formulation known
as recursive utility, in which the agent’s time t utility, Vt , is given by
Vt = W (Ct , µ(Vt+1 |It )),
12

(11)

where µ(Vt+1 |It ) is the certainty equivalent of the distribution of future utility, Vt+1 , conditional on time t information It , and W (·, ·) is an aggregator function that aggregates current
consumption Ct with the certainty equivalent of future utility to give current utility (see
Epstein and Zin, 1989, for a detailed discussion). Most implementations of recursive utility
assign W (·, ·) the form
1

W (C, y) = ((1 − β)C ρ + βy ρ) ρ , 0 < β < 1, 0 = ρ < 1,

(12)

where β is a time discount factor and ρ controls the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
Most implementations also assume homogeneity of µ(·). If a certainty equivalent functional
is homogeneous, it is necessarily homogeneous of degree one, so that
µ(kz) = kµ(z), k > 0.

(13)

In its current form, the speciﬁcation in equation (11) does not allow for narrow framing:
an investor with these preferences only cares about the outcome of a gamble he is oﬀered
to the extent that that outcome aﬀects his overall wealth risk. Barberis and Huang (2004)
show, however, that these preferences can be extended to accommodate narrow framing.
They specify their utility function in a general context, but for the speciﬁc three-asset setting
introduced earlier, their formulation reduces to
Vt = W (Ct , µ(Vt+1 |It ) + b0 Et (v(GS,t+1 ))) ,

(14)

where
1

W (C, y) = ((1 − β)C ρ + βy ρ) ρ , 0 < β < 1, 0 = ρ < 1

(15)

µ(kz) = kµ(z), k > 0

(16)

GS,t+1 = θS,t (Wt − Ct )(RS,t+1 − Rf,t )

(17)



v(x) =

x
λx

for

x≥0
, λ > 1.
x<0

(18)

Relative to the usual recursive speciﬁcation in equation (11), this new formulation maintains the standard assumptions for W (·, ·) and µ(·). The diﬀerence is that a new term,
that captures loss aversion and narrow framing, has been added to the second argument
of W (·, ·). As before, GS,t+1 represents changes in the value of the investor’s stock market
holdings, measured relative to the risk-free rate. By letting the investor get direct utility
v(GS,t+1 ) from changes in the value of this one component of his wealth, we are introducing
narrow framing, with the degree of narrow framing again controlled by b0 . Loss aversion is
introduced through the piecewise linearity of v(·), just as in the earlier speciﬁcation in (5).8
8

It is straightforward to also allow for the narrow framing of the non-ﬁnancial asset. Doing so does not
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on our results.

13

Since our focus is on the eﬀects of narrow framing, we give the certainty equivalent
functional µ(·) the simplest possible form, namely
1

µ(z) = (E(z ζ )) ζ ,

(19)

where the exponent ζ is set to the same value as the exponent in the aggregator function, ρ.
We denote this common value 1 − γ, so that
ρ = ζ = 1 − γ.

Quantitative implications

We now use the speciﬁcation in equation (14) to illustrate two beneﬁts of the narrow framing
approach in more detail: ﬁrst, that it can generate a high equity premium at the same time
as a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption growth is smooth and only weakly
correlated with stock returns; and then in Section 3.3, that it can do so while also making
sensible predictions about attitudes to large-scale monetary gambles.
To see the ﬁrst result, consider a simple economy with a representative agent who has
the preferences in equation (14). As before, there are three assets: a risk-free asset in zero
net supply, and two risky assets, a stock market and a non-ﬁnancial asset, both in positive
net supply. Barberis and Huang (2004) show that, in this setting, the ﬁrst-order conditions
of optimality are

We use equations (33)-(35) to compute the equilibrium equity premium. First, we set
the return and consumption process parameters to the values in Table 1. These values are
estimated from annual data spanning the 20th century and are standard in the literature.
Then, for given preference parameters β, γ, b0 , and λ, and for a given stock market fraction
of total wealth θS , equations (33)-(35) can be solved for α, Rf , and gS , thereby giving us the
equity premium.
15

Table 2 presents the results. We take β = 0.98 and θS = 0.2, and consider various values
of γ, λ, and b0 . The parameter β has little eﬀect on attitudes to risk; setting it to 0.98
ensures that the risk-free rate is not too high. Our results are quantitatively similar for a
range of values of θS .
The table conﬁrms that narrow framing of stocks can generate a substantial equity premium at the same time as a low risk-free rate, even when, as shown in Table 1, consumption
growth is smooth and only weakly correlated with stock returns. For example, the parameter
values (γ, λ, b0 ) = (1.5, 2, 0.1) produce an equity premium of 4.63% and a risk-free rate of
3.4%, while (γ, λ, b0 ) = (1.5, 3, 0.1) produce a premium as high as 8.12% with a risk-free
rate of only 2.3%. The intuition is the same as in Benartzi and Thaler (1995) and Barberis,
Huang, and Santos (2001): if the agent gets utility directly from changes in the value of the
stock market and, via the parameter λ, is more sensitive to losses than to gains, he perceives
the stock market to be very risky and only holds the available supply if compensated by a
high average return.
The assumption that the agent evaluates stock market gains and losses on an annual
basis is important for our results, but not critical. Table 3 reports equity premia for an
investor with the preferences in equation (14), but who evaluates stock market gains and
losses at intervals other than a year. The table shows that, even though the equity premium
declines as the interval grows, long evaluation periods can still generate substantial equity
premia at the same time as a low risk-free rate.
The intuition for why the equity premium is lower for longer evaluation periods, ﬁrst
pointed out by Benartzi and Thaler (1995), is straightforward. Since the distribution of
stock returns has a positive mean, the probability of seeing a drop in the stock market falls
as returns are aggregated at longer intervals. While annual stock returns might be negative
40% of the time, ﬁve-year returns are negative less often. A loss averse agent is therefore
less scared of stocks when he evaluates their returns at longer intervals, and, as a result,
demands a lower equity premium.

3.3

Attitudes to large monetary gambles

We now demonstrate another attractive feature of the preference speciﬁcation in equation
(14), namely that it can deliver a high equity premium for parameterizations that are “reasonable,” in the sense that they correspond to sensible attitudes to independent monetary
gambles. This is important because it was, in part, the diﬃculty researchers encountered
in reconciling the equity premium with attitudes to monetary gambles that launched the
equity premium literature in the ﬁrst place. Economists are primarily interested in attitudes
to large-scale monetary gambles, so we begin with those. In Section 3.4, we also consider

16

attitudes to small-scale gambles.
The literature has suggested a number of thought experiments involving large-scale gambles. Epstein and Zin (1990) and Kandel and Stambaugh (1991) consider an individual with
wealth of $75, 000 and ask what premium he would pay to avoid a 50:50 chance of losing
$25, 000 or gaining the same amount; in Kandel and Stambaugh’s (1991) view, a premium of
$24, 000 is too high, but a premium of $8, 333 is more reasonable. Mankiw and Zeldes (1991)
think about the value of x for which an agent would be indiﬀerent between certain consumption of $x and a 50:50 chance of $50, 000 consumption or $100, 000 consumption. Rabin
(2000) suggests a mild condition, namely that an agent should accept a clearly attractive
large gamble such as a 50:50 bet to win $20 million against a $10, 000 loss.
It does not matter, for our results, which of these thought experiments we use. In what
follows, we focus on the one suggested by Epstein and Zin (1990) and Kandel and Stambaugh
(1991). In our view, a reasonable condition to impose is:9
Condition L: An individual with wealth of $75, 000 should not pay a premium higher than
$15, 000 to avoid a 50:50 chance of losing $25, 000 or gaining the same amount.
Barberis and Huang (2004) show that, to avoid a gamble g oﬀering an equal chance to
win or lose x, an investor with the preferences in equation (14) would pay a premium equal
to
1
A(Wt − (E(Wt + g)1−γ ) 1−γ ) + b0 x2 (λ − 1)
π=
,
(37)
A + b0 λ
where
γ
1
(38)
A = (1 − β) 1−γ α− 1−γ ,
with α already computed in equations (33)-(35) above. In this calculation, they make the
simplest possible assumption, namely that, whatever degree of narrow framing b0 and level
of loss aversion λ the investor uses when thinking about stock market risk, he also uses when
thinking about the independent monetary gamble g. When b0 = 0, equation (37) gives the
premium that would be charged by an agent with standard power utility preferences. When
b0 > 0, the premium in equation (37) reﬂects the fact that, to some extent, the investor is
framing gamble g narrowly. For large b0 , equation (37) reduces to
π=

x
(λ − 1),
2λ

(39)

the premium that would be charged by an agent who evaluates gamble g completely in
isolation and who is λ times as sensitive to losses as to gains.
Using equation (37), the right-most columns in Tables 2 and 3 show, for each parameterization, the amount that the representative agent would pay, given his equilibrium holdings of
9

We use the label “condition L” to emphasize that we are thinking about Large-scale gambles.

17

risky assets, to avoid the symmetric bet in condition L. The rows in which b0 = 0 reproduce
a well-known result: that for power utility preferences, those values of γ low enough to make
sensible predictions about attitudes to large-scale monetary gambles inevitably generate too
low an equity premium.
Table 2 shows, however, that as soon as narrow framing is allowed – in other words, as
soon as b0 > 0 – it is easy to ﬁnd parameterizations that give a high equity premium while
also satisfying condition L. When (γ, λ, b0 ) = (1.5, 2, 0.1), for example, the investor charges
a substantial equity premium of 4.63%, and a reasonable $6, 269 to avoid the ±$25, 000
gamble.
How is it that the preference speciﬁcation in equation (14) can reconcile attitudes to stock
market risk and to the large-scale monetary gamble in condition L when other speciﬁcations
have trouble doing so? To see how, note ﬁrst that, in the simple representative agent economy
described by conditions (i)-(iv) in Section 3.2, the equity premium is determined by the
agent’s attitude, in equilibrium, to adding a small amount of stock market risk to a portfolio
that is only weakly correlated with the stock market. Why can we say “weakly” correlated?
Since representative agent economies are calibrated to aggregate data, the correlation of
stock returns and consumption growth, ρCS , must be set to a low value; given that the
consumption-wealth ratio is constant, this immediately implies a low correlation between
stock returns and returns on total wealth.10
To generate a substantial equity premium, then, we need the agent to be strongly averse
or, at the very least, moderately averse, to a small, weakly correlated gamble. To satisfy
condition L, we need the agent to be mildly averse or, at most, moderately averse, to a large,
independent gamble.
Now consider the two functions in the second argument of W (·, ·) in equation (14),
namely µ(·) and v(·). For a γ of 1.5, the µ(·) term, by virtue of its local risk-neutrality,
produces only mild aversion to a small, weakly correlated gamble, but moderate aversion
to a large, independent gamble. For a λ of 2, the v(·) term, by virtue of being piecewise
linear, produces moderate aversion both to a small, weakly correlated gamble and to a large,
independent gamble. For a degree of narrow framing b0 that is high enough, the two terms
therefore generate moderate aversion to a small, weakly correlated gamble – thereby giving a
substantial equity premium – and moderate aversion to a large, independent gamble, thereby
satisfying condition L.
10

Of course, in more general representative agent economies, the consumption-wealth ratio need not be
constant. So long as the ratio is suﬃciently stable, however, it should still follow that stock returns and
returns on total wealth are only weakly correlated.

18

3.4

Attitudes to small monetary gambles

In Section 3.3, we saw that the preferences in equation (14), capturing both loss aversion
and narrow framing, can generate a large equity premium for preference parameters that
also correspond to sensible attitudes to large-scale monetary gambles, in that they satisfy
condition L. In fact, condition L does not put very sharp restrictions on the range of equity
premia that we can generate: as Table 2 shows, it can be consistent with premia as low as
0.12% or as high as 8.12%.
In this section, we show that by requiring the preference speciﬁcation in equation (14)
to also make sensible predictions about attitudes to small -scale gambles, we can put tighter
bounds on the range of equity premia that narrow framing can plausibly generate. The
intuition is straightforward. As argued earlier, in the simple representative agent economy
of Section 3.2, the equity premium is determined by the agent’s attitude, in equilibrium, to
adding a small amount of weakly correlated stock market risk to the rest of his portfolio.
If we impose constraints on the investor’s attitude to a small, independent risk, it is likely
that we will also constrain his attitude to a small, weakly correlated risk and thereby also,
the equity premium he will charge.
What condition should we impose on attitudes to small-scale gambles? As with largescale gambles, the earlier literature has suggested a number of relevant thought experiments.
For consistency with our earlier discussion, we return to Epstein and Zin (1990), who ask
how much an individual with wealth of $75, 000 would pay to avoid a 50:50 bet to lose $250
or to win the same amount. In our view, a reasonable condition to impose here is:11
Condition S: An individual with wealth of $75, 000 should not pay a premium higher than
$40 to avoid a 50:50 chance of losing $250 or gaining the same amount.
Figure 1 shows how condition S sharply restricts the range of equity premia that can be
generated by the preferences in equation (14). The “x” signs show, for γ = 1.5, the values
of λ and b0 that produce equity premia higher than 5%. Clearly, either a high sensitivity
to losses λ, or a high degree of narrow framing b0 , or both, are required to generate equity
premia as large as 5%. Note that our earlier condition on attitudes to large-scale gambles,
condition L, is satisﬁed by all values of λ and b0 spanned by the graph – in other words,
by all pairs (λ, b0 ) [0, 4] × [0, 0.1]. If condition L were the only condition constraining our
choice of preference parameters, we could therefore easily obtain premia higher than 5%.
The “+” signs in the ﬁgure show the values of λ and b0 that satisfy condition S. Imposing
this condition severely restricts the range of feasible values of λ and b0 . In fact, we cannot
obtain an equity premium as high as 5% without violating it.
11

We use the label “condition S” to emphasize that we are thinking about Small-scale gambles.

19

Even though condition S does restrict the feasible parameter set, it still allows for sizeable equity premia. Table 4 lists some parameter values that satisfy both condition L and
condition S, and yet still produce equity premia above 3%.

3.5

The importance of narrow framing

While narrow framing is admittedly an unusual feature of preferences, it is crucial to our
results. To demonstrate this, we now show that, in the absence of narrow framing, it becomes
much harder to replicate some of the attractive features of the preferences in equation (14)
– much harder, for example, to reconcile a high equity premium with reasonable attitudes
to large-scale monetary gambles, and, in particular, with the attitudes imposed by condition
L.
Consider a model in which the agent is loss averse over annual changes in total wealth,
rather than in stock market wealth. Such a model maintains the assumptions of loss aversion
and of annual evaluation of gains and losses, but by changing the focus from gains and losses
in stock market wealth to gains and losses in total wealth, it removes the narrow framing.
One such preference speciﬁcation is the following:
Vt = W (Ct , µ(Vt+1 |It )),
where

1

W (C, y) = ((1 − β)C ρ + βy ρ) ρ , 0 < β < 1, 0 = ρ < 1,

(40)

(41)

and where the certainty equivalent functional µ(·) takes a form proposed by Gul (1991),
often referred to as “disappointment aversion”:
µ(V )1−γ = E(V 1−γ ) + (λ − 1)E((V 1−γ − µ(V )1−γ )1(V < µ(V ))), 0 < γ = 1, λ > 1. (42)
While the speciﬁcation in (42) looks somewhat messy, it is simply a function with a kink,
which makes the investor more sensitive to losses than to gains. The parameter λ controls
the relative sensitivity to losses.12
We consider a simple economy with a representative agent who has the preferences in
equations (40)-(42). The market structure is the same as before. There are three risky assets:
a risk-free asset, in zero net supply, and two risky assets, a stock market and a non-ﬁnancial
asset, each in positive net supply. Epstein and Zin (1989) show that the ﬁrst-order conditions

and where N(·) is the cumulative Normal distribution function.
We use equations (47)-(49) to compute the equilibrium equity premium. As before, we
set the return and consumption process parameters to the values in Table 1. Then, for given
preference parameters β, ρ, and γ, we use equation (47) to compute the consumption-wealth
ratio α, equation (49) to compute the risk-free rate Rf , and equation (48) to compute the
mean log stock return gS .
To check whether the parameters corresponding to any particular equity premium are
reasonable – in other words, whether they satisfy condition L – we need to know the premium
an agent with the preferences in equations (40)-(42) would pay to avoid a gamble to win or
lose x with equal chance. Following the analysis in Epstein and Zin (1989), it can be shown
that the premium π is given by

It is straightforward to show that such a structure can be embedded in a general equilibrium model.

21

The parameters β and ρ have little eﬀect on attitudes to risk. We set them to 0.95 and
−1, respectively, to ensure that the risk-free rate is not too high. The area shaded with “+”
signs in Figure 2 shows the values of γ and λ for which the representative agent satisﬁes
condition L; in other words, the values for which, given his equilibrium holdings of risky
assets and wealth of $75, 000, he pays a premium below $15, 000 to avoid a 50:50 chance
of losing $25, 000 or winning the same amount. The area shaded with “x” signs shows the
values of γ and λ for which the representative agent charges an equity premium higher than
2%. There is no overlap between the two regions: in fact, the largest equity premium that
we can generate with this preference speciﬁcation under condition L is 0.93%, far smaller
than the equity premia derived from narrow framing in Table 2.14
To see the intuition for this result, recall from Section 3.3 that, in the simple, representative agent economy considered here, the equity premium is determined by the agent’s
attitude, in equilibrium, to adding an extra dollar of stock market risk to a portfolio that is
only weakly correlated with the stock market. In the absence of narrow framing, the agent
evaluates this extra risk by merging it with his other risks and checking if the combination
is attractive. Since the stock market is only weakly correlated with his other risks, it diversiﬁes those other risks and so the combination is attractive: even a loss averse agent enjoys
diversiﬁcation. As a result, he charges a low equity premium. To generate a large premium,
we would need to push up aversion to overall wealth risk, but this would immediately lead
to a violation of condition L.
As we saw in Section 3.3, a simple way out of this diﬃculty is to argue that, when the
agent evaluates stock market risk, he does not fully merge it with his other risks, but rather,
evaluates it in isolation; in other words, that he frames stock market risk narrowly.

Other Applications

Barberis, Huang, and Thaler (2006) argue that the preferences in equation (14) can also
address a portfolio puzzle that is closely related to the equity premium puzzle, namely the
stock market participation puzzle: the fact that, even though stocks have a high mean return,
many households have historically been unwilling to allocate any money to them. Mankiw
and Zeldes (1991) report, for example, that in 1984, only 28% of households held any stock
at all, and only 12% held more than $10,000 in stock. Non-participation was not simply the
result of not having any liquid assets. Even among households with more than $100,000 in
liquid assets, only 48% held stocks (see also Haliassos and Bertaut, 1995).
14

Epstein and Zin (1990) and Epstein and Zin (2001) obtain comparable results. For example, in Table 5
of their paper, Epstein and Zin (2001) report that, for parameterizations of the preferences in (40)-(42) that
match the historical equity premium, the representative agent may charge as much as $23, 000 to avoid the
±$25, 000 bet. See also Bekaert, Hodrick, and Marshall (1997).

22

One approach to this puzzle is to argue that there are transaction costs of investing in
the stock market; another is to examine whether non-stockholders have background risk
that is somewhat correlated with the stock market (Heaton and Lucas 1997, 2000, VissingJorgensen, 2002). A third approach is preference-based, and this is the one Barberis, Huang,
and Thaler (2006) focus on. Speciﬁcally, they show that the preferences in equation (14) can
generate stock market non-participation, and, mirroring the results for the equity premium,
that they can do so for preference parameterizations that are reasonable, in other words, that
make sensible predictions about attitudes to large-scale monetary gambles by, for example,
satisfying condition L.
It is easy to see how the preferences in (14) generate non-participation: if the agent gets
direct utility from ﬂuctuations in the value of any stocks that he owns, and if he is loss
averse over these ﬂuctuations, he is naturally going to be averse to stock market risk, and
may refuse to participate.
How is it that Barberis, Huang, and Thaler (2006) generate non-participation for reasonable parameter values? An agent who refuses to participate in the stock market is eﬀectively
refusing to take on a small amount of a risk that is, according to Heaton and Lucas’ (2000)
estimates, relatively uncorrelated with his other risks. To generate such attitudes at the
same time as reasonable attitudes to large-scale gambles, we need preferences that generate moderate aversion to a small, weakly correlated risk – thereby leading to stock market
non-participation – at the same time as moderate aversion to a large, independent risk,
thereby satisfying condition L. As discussed in Section 3.3, the preferences in equation (14)
can achieve exactly this.
Without narrow framing, it becomes much harder to ﬁnd preference speciﬁcations that
can generate non-participation for reasonable parameter values. In the absence of narrow
framing, the agent decides whether to participate by mixing a small amount of stock market
risk with his other risks and checking whether the combination is attractive. Since stock
market risk is only weakly correlated with his other risks, it is diversifying, and so the
combination is, quite generally, attractive. To prevent the agent from participating, we need
to impose very high aversion to overall wealth risk, but this typically leads to implausible
aversion to large-scale gambles and, in particular, to violations of condition L. This logic has
been conﬁrmed by Heaton and Lucas (2000), Haliassos and Hassapis (2001), and Barberis,
Huang, and Thaler (2006), who consider a number of diﬀerent speciﬁcations without narrow
framing – including speciﬁcations that incorporate loss aversion – and ﬁnd that all of them
have trouble generating non-participation for reasonable parameter values.15
15

An alternative preference-based approach to the stock market participation puzzle is based on ambiguity
aversion (Epstein and Schneider, 2002). This approach has some similarities to the narrow framing approach,
in that it works by inducing something akin to loss aversion over the stock market gamble itself.

Further Extensions

5.1

Dynamic aspects of loss aversion

In equilibrium, the preferences in (5) and (14) can easily deliver a high equity premium and
a low and stable risk-free rate, but they have a harder time matching the empirical volatility
of returns. Under these preferences, the volatility of returns is typically very similar to the
volatility of dividend growth, and therefore too low.
Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) show that incorporating dynamic aspects of loss
aversion into the speciﬁcation in (5) can help match the empirical volatility of returns.16
Drawing on a number of diﬀerent experimental tests, Thaler and Johnson (1990) argue that
the degree of loss aversion is not constant over time, but depends on prior gains and losses.
In particular, they present evidence that losses are less painful than usual after prior gains,
perhaps because those gains cushion any subsequent loss; and that losses after prior losses
are more painful than usual, perhaps because people have only limited capacity for dealing
with bad news.
Barberis, Huang, and Santos (2001) capture this evidence by making v(·) in (5) a function
not only of the current stock market return RS,t+1 but also of prior gains and losses in the
stock market. They then show that this raises the volatility of returns relative to the volatility
of dividend growth: on good dividend news, the stock market goes up, giving the investor a
cushion of prior gains and making him less sensitive to future losses; as a result, he perceives
stocks to be less risky and discounts their future cash ﬂows at a lower rate, thereby pushing
prices still higher and raising the volatility of returns. The same mechanism also generates
predictability in the time series: after prior gains, the investor perceives the stock market
to be less risky and so pushes the price of stocks up relative to dividends; but from this
point on, average returns will be lower, as the investor needs less compensation for the lower
perceived risk. Price-dividend ratios therefore predict returns.
One attractive feature of this mechanism is that it preserves the low correlation of stock
returns and consumption growth seen in the models of Section 3: since movements in the
price-dividend ratio are driven by innovations to dividends, the correlation of stock returns
and consumption growth is similar to the correlation of dividend growth and consumption
growth, and is therefore low. This contrasts with other models of stock market volatility,
such as that of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), in which movements in the price-dividend
ratio are driven by innovations to consumption. These models inevitably predict a high
correlation of stock returns and consumption growth.
16

A similar analysis can be conducted with the speciﬁcation in equation (14).

24

5.2

Other forms of narrow framing

In the economy described in Section 3, there were only two risky assets: the stock market
and a non-ﬁnancial asset. There were therefore only a limited number of ways in which
narrow framing could manifest itself. The investor could get direct utility from stock market
ﬂuctuations, direct utility from ﬂuctuations in the value of the non-ﬁnancial asset, or both.
A more realistic model would allow the investor to trade not only a broad stock market
index, but individual stocks as well. Narrow framing could then, in principle, mean that the
investor gets direct utility from ﬂuctuations in the value of individual stocks that he owns.
What eﬀect would this have?
Barberis and Huang (2001) investigate this issue by extending the preferences in (5) to
allow the agent to frame several assets narrowly.17 Among other implications, they ﬁnd that,
if investors engage in the more extreme form of narrow framing whereby they frame even
individual stocks narrowly, the equity premium can be even higher than in the case studied
in Section 3, where they frame only their overall portfolio of stocks narrowly: if investors
worry about ﬂuctuations in highly volatile individual stocks rather than about ﬂuctuations
in the less volatile aggregate stock market, they perceive stocks to be very risky and charge
a very high equity premium in equilibrium.
Is it plausible that people might frame individual stocks narrowly? From a theoretical
perspective, it is hard to tell. Consider Kahneman’s (2003) “accessibility” theory of framing. It is true that for most investors, information about the return distribution of individual
stocks is highly accessible. But so too is information about the return distribution of diversiﬁed stock portfolios, and it seems that given a choice between the broader frame and the
narrower one, people will choose the normatively more acceptable frame, namely the broader
one, for their decision-making.
Under the alternative theory that narrow framing is related to non-consumption utility
such as regret, framing at the level of individual stocks becomes more plausible. If one of
the investor’s stocks performs poorly, he may regret the speciﬁc decision to buy that stock.
Gains and losses on individual stocks can therefore be carriers of utility in their own right,
and the investor may take this into account when making decisions.
The framing of individual stocks is also supported by the well-known disposition eﬀect –
the fact that, when individual investors sell stocks in their portfolios, they tend to sell stocks
that have gone up in value since purchase, rather than stocks that have gone down in value
(Shefrin and Statman, 1985, Odean, 1998). A common explanation for this ﬁnding is that
people get direct utility from realizing a loss on an individual stock that they own and that
this leads them to postpone selling a losing stock for as long as possible.18

18

A similar analysis can be conducted with the speciﬁcation in equation (14).
Tax considerations point to the selling of prior losers, so they cannot explain the disposition eﬀect. Nor

Conclusion and Future Directions

In this essay, we review a recent approach to addressing the equity premium puzzle. The
broad theme of this approach is that we may be able to improve our understanding of how
people evaluate stock market risk by looking at how they evaluate risk in experimental
settings. Speciﬁcally, this approach argues that loss aversion and narrow framing, two of the
most important ideas to emerge from the experimental literature on decision-making under
risk, may also play an important role in the way some people think about the stock market.
We discuss various ways of incorporating loss aversion and narrow framing into more
traditional utility functions, and show that models with these features may indeed oﬀer
an attractive way of thinking about the historical equity premium. For example, they can
generate a high equity premium and a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption
growth is smooth and only weakly correlated with the stock market; moreover, they can
do this for parameter values that are reasonable, in other words, parameter values that
correspond to sensible attitudes to independent monetary gambles. A parallel result holds
in the case of the stock market participation puzzle: loss aversion and narrow framing can
generate non-participation for reasonable parameter values.
While these initial results are promising, much work remains. The most obvious direction
for future research is to think about testable implications of the loss aversion / narrow framing
view. For example, while narrow framing makes a blanket prediction of non-participation in
the stock market, does it also make more detailed predictions about what kinds of people are
more likely to participate than others? Does it predict changes in participation over time,
perhaps due to changes in framing? Are there any real-world situations in which people are
asked to make a certain ﬁnancial decision after seeing some data, and that have the feature
that while everyone sees the same data, some people see it presented somewhat diﬀerently
than others? The diﬀerences in the way the data is presented could lead people to frame
future outcomes diﬀerently, and therefore to make diﬀerent choices.
Researchers have already begun testing the view of the equity premium and participation
puzzles presented here. Dimmock (2005) describes a survey, conducted in the Netherlands,
in which subjects were given a decision problem involving riskless choice. Responses to
this decision problem can be used to extract estimates of individual loss aversion. After
extracting these estimates from the data, Dimmock (2005) ﬁnds that individuals with greater
loss aversion are indeed less likely to participate in the stock market.
Narrow framing is harder to measure than loss aversion, but successful tests of narrow
framing in other settings suggest that progress can also be made in the context of the equity
can the eﬀect be explained by a rational belief in mean-reversion: the stocks that individual investors sell
actually outperform the ones they buy (Odean, 1998).

26

premium and stock market participation puzzles. Kumar and Lim (2004), for example, test
the idea that narrow framing is behind the disposition eﬀect by checking whether individual
investors who engage less in narrow framing also exhibit the disposition eﬀect less. They
identify these investors as those who tend to execute more than one trade on any given day,
and who might therefore pay less attention to the outcome of any one transaction. They
ﬁnd that these investors do indeed exhibit less of a disposition eﬀect.
Our attempt to bring psychology into economics has also served to highlight some areas
of psychology where more research would be valuable. While there is evidence that, in
some situations, people frame narrowly, we still do not fully understand when people frame
narrowly and when they do not, nor what the underlying causes of narrow framing are.
Similarly, while loss aversion itself is a robust and well-documented phenomenon, much less
is known about its dynamic aspects: for example, about how past gains and losses aﬀect
subsequent loss aversion. Thaler and Johnson (1990) provide some valuable evidence on this
point, but it is hard to believe that theirs is the last word. A better understanding of these
issues, perhaps through more experimental research, may eventually help us craft better
models of how people evaluate stock market risk.
