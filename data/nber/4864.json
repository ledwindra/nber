    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper proposes a method for computing tax rates using national accounts and revenue statistics.  Using this method we construct time-series of tax rates for large industrial countries. The method identifies the revenue raised by different taxes at the general government level and defines aggregate measures of the corresponding tax bases.  This method yields estimates of effective tax rates on factor incomes and consumption consistent with the tax distortions faced by a representative agent in a general equilibrium framework.  These tax rates compare favorably with existing estimates of marginal tax rates, and highlight important international differences in tax policy.\n\n",
