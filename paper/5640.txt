June 1996

INSURANCE OR SELF-~ SUWNCE?:
VARIATION, PERSISTENCE, AND
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH ACCOUNTS
ABSTRACT

We explore the feasibility of catastrophic health insurance established in conjunction with
individual health accounts (IHAs). Under this plan, the employer establishes both a high-deductible
health insurance plan and an IHA. Employee health care costs below the deductible are then paid
out of the IHA; costs above the deductible are paid by the insurance plan. Assets remaining in the
account when the employee retires are available for other purposes.
Although attractive because it helps to solve the “moral hazard” problem associated with
conventional insurance plans, the scheme may be considered infeasible if medical expenditures over
a working life are so persistent that certain individuals accumulate little in the IHA while others
accumulate a great deal, Within the context of an illustrative IHA plan, we develop preliminary
empirical evidence on the distribution of medical expenditures-and
hence savings—under an IHA
plan. Our analysis is based on longitudinal health insurance claims data from a large firm, We
emphasize the balance in the IHA account at retirement. Although such a plan would produce a
range of balances across employees, approximately 80°/0 would retain over 50°/0 of their
contributions. Only about 5°/0would retain less than 20°/0 of their contributions.
The outcomes suggest to us that such a plan is feasible. And, we believe that such a plan
could be structured to increase retirement savings.

The motivation for the parallel saving and insurance plans, of course, is that
each employee is spending his or her “own” money for medical care, except
in the event of serious illness. The plan thus combines the desirable features
of catastrophic coverage for reducing medical expenditures,

as advocated by

Feldstein [1971] and by Feldstein and Gruber [1994], with a mechanism that
creates a reserve from which individual expenses can be paid.

Indeed, we believe that in practice feasibility may depend largely on what the

We illustrate

the

implications of the concentration by considering the distribution of balances at
retirement in an IHA account with a $2,000 annual contribution.

Although the

vast majority of participants retire with substantial IHA balances, some incur
substantial out-of-pocket costs and thus retire with only small balances. About
80% of employees

are left with at least 50% of total IHA contributions,

but

about 5% have less than 20Y0.
We conclude with a discussion of the implications and limitations of this
preliminary analysis.

We comment on issues that are not addressed and on

future research plans.

and concentration

The relationship

is shown in Figure 1. The Figure

shows that in 1989 about 80% of cost was incurred by 10 percent of enrollees,
roughly comparable to concentration results from other studies.

Fifty percent

of employees incurred virtually no cost. Figure 1 also shows the concentration
of annual expenditures

averaged over the two-year period of 1989 to 1990,

and over the three-year period of 1989 to 1991. If there were no persistence
in cost from one year to the next, costs averaged over several years would be
much less concentrated

among a few enrollees than costs in a single year.

The curves show that although concentration
increases,

declines as the time period

even over three years a small proportion of employees

incur an

enormous fraction of health care costs. Averaged over three years, 10% of
enrollees account for a full 65% of expenditures.

If there were no persistence

from year to year, then averaged over many years the cost accounted for by
the highest-cost

decile would approach

10%.

presented below shows that concentration declines continuously as more and
more years of expenditures

are cumulated,

Enrollees are

divided into deciles based on 1989 claims. The figure shows expenditures

in

1989 by decile, and then, also by 1989 decile, average annual expenditures
one year later in 1990 and two years later in 1991. For comparison, the figure
also shows average expenditures

for all enrollees over these three years,

which was $1,314. Persons in the tenth decile in 1989, in that year spent over
eight times as much as the average.

They spent close to five times the

average in 1990 and almost three times the average in 1991. Averaged over
all three years, those in the highest decile in 1989 spent about five times the
average.
An alternative description is shown in Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c. Figure 3a

the model to simulate their expenditures

in the ten subsequent

years.

We

compared the predictions in the subsequent two years with the actual data.
For the first two years, for which we have matching actual data, the actual and
simulated means are very close. The lag structure in the model is of course
a way to extrapolate

the decline in expenditures

to future years and the

simulations imply that after 4 or 5 years the expenditures of persons with large
shocks approach the overall sample mean. The simulated and actual “decay”
patterns are shown in Appendix Figure 1.

-20-

Second, we considered the future expenditures of persons with specific
1989 diagnoses

that are typically associated

with high expenditures.

In

particular, we were concerned that the expenditure decay in these cases be
consistent

with the implications

of the model.

We considered

and only 13% in 1991. We take these results as evidence that are simulated

In particular, we find no reason to suspect

that they are too rapid.
We conclude that simulated expenditure patterns compare closely with

SIMULATION

RESULTS.

We have simulated the lifetime expenditures

of 1,000 employees who

begin work at age 25 and retire at 60. We realize that few, if any persons,
would work for the same firm for that length of time, but it is the expenditure
pattern that we want to capture, assuming that employees continued to face
an insurance scheme like the one at this firm.

IHA Balances.

Given the distribution of expenditures

described above, how might an

IHA plan work? We consider this plan:
*

The employer puts $2,000
beginning of each year.

*

The health insurance plan has a $4,000 annual deductible, with
expenses below the deductible paid by the employee (out of the
IHA) and 100 percent of expenditures above the deductible
covered by the health insurance plan. If the IHA balance goes to
zero, all expenses are paid by the insurance plan.

The distribution

in each employee’s

IHA at the

of IHA balances at selected ages is shown in Figures 8.

Only about 10% have balances less than about

After a lifetime, there is more variation in the IHA balances, but most

employees

are left with a substantial

accumulation.

About 90% of the

employees have a balance at age 60 that exceeds $25,000, while 75% have
more than $40,000 and 50% have more than $50,000.

The distributions

are

similar for salaried women and for hourly employees.
Another

way to understand

the plan implications

is to consider the

proportion of IHA contributions that remain at selected ages. The distributions
of these proportions

is shown in Figures 9. Two features of the distributions

The average balance remaining in the IHA is shown by age in Figure 10.
The fraction can be compared to the 45 degree line which represents

Although the plan would produce a range of balances across

employees, approximately 80% of employees would retain more than 50% of
their IHA contributions.

Only about 5% of employees would retain less than

20% of their contributions.

These outcomes do not appear to us to be so

extreme as to make the plan a non-starter.
To say more, we need to incorporate

additional components

analysis. While we believe that such a plan would reduce medical expenses

Our analysis reveals that

small changes in the structure of the plan can substantially alter the “way the
numbers look.” For example, if the IHA contribution is made at the end of the
year -- and thus is not available to fund expenditures

in the current year --

virtually no one would be left with IHA accumulations less than 35% to 40% of
their contributions (although this would generate a somewhat higher insurance
premium).

The results would also look quite different if IHA contribution were

$1,000 instead of $2,000.

-27-

We intend to consider all these issues more thoroughly in future work.
We also plan to re-estimate the parameters of our model with longer panels
of expenditure data when they become available, and to consider other kinds
of health plan reforms from the perspective of lifetime expenditures.
