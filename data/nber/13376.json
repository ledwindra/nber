    "abstract": "\n\nForeign-invested enterprises (FIEs) account for well over half of all Chinese exports and this share continues to grow.  While the substantial presence of FIEs has contributed greatly to the recent export-led growth of China, an important objective of the Chinese government is to ultimately obtain foreign technologies and develop their own technological capabilities domestically.  This paper uses detailed data on Chinese exports by sector and type of enterprise to examine the extent to which domestic enterprises are \"keeping up\" or even \"catching up\" to FIEs in the volume, composition and quality of their exports.  We also use a newly-created dataset on Chinese policies encouraging or restricting FIEs across sectors to examine the extent to which such policies can affect the evolving composition of Chinese exports.\n\n",
