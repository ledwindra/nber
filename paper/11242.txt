Ex Ante Carrots instead of Ex Post Sticks: Two Examples

NBER Working Paper No. 11242
March 2005
JEL No. F15, F21, F34
ABSTRACT
This paper argues that the limited ability to help developing countries in a crisis should shift the
focus to policies helping in reducing the ex ante probability of crises. Indirectly, such policies would
also alleviate the depths of realized crises. Two specific ideas are explored:
I. International reserves escrow accounts: Managing international reserves provides an effective
mechanism for self insurance. The hazard of this mechanism is that international reserves are easy
prey for opportunistic policy makers in polarized countries characterized by political instability. This
hazard may be alleviated by escrow accounts run by the International Financial Institutions (IFIs),
where part of the international reserves of a country are saved and would be used if pre-set
conditions, like large TOT deteriorations, are met. The IFIs may offer a subsidized return on these
escrow accounts in order to encourage countries to reduce external borrowing and to increase fiscal
savings. Such subsidies may be welfare improving due to the over borrowing bias induced by
sovereign risk.
II. IFIs as lenders of last resort to finance fiscal reforms: I illustrate this possibility in a modified
version of Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellinis (AER 1992) model. I identify conditions where IFIs
function as the lenders of last resort, financing fiscal reforms. IFIs financing may shift the
equilibrium from an inefficient outcome with a low tax base and high inflation to a superior
outcome, associated with a more sound tax system.

The Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project:
“Following the Government’s agreement with the World Bank, Chad’s Parliament on
December 30, 1998 approved a law setting out the Government’s poverty reduction objectives and
arrangements for the use of oil revenues, along with the Management of the Petroleum Revenue Program
agreed to with the Bank. Revenues due to Chad are deposited in an escrow account, established at
Citibank in London.
Under the law, 10% of Chad’s oil direct revenues (dividends and royalties) should be held in
trust for future generations, a so-called Future Generations Fund. Of the remaining funds, 80% of
royalties and 85% of dividends are to be devoted to education, health and social services, rural
development, infrastructure, and environmental and water resource management, and 5% of royalties
should be earmarked for regional development in the oil-producing area, in addition to budget allocations
the region already receives. Up to December 31, 2007, 15 % of direct oil revenues can be spent on
general expenditures; after that date, these revenues will be earmarked to priority sectors for poverty
reduction. Indirect revenues (income taxes) will flow directly from the escrow account to the Treasury
account held in the Central Bank. They will finance general expenditures.”
World Bank update, Oct. 4, 2004

The role of International Financial Institutes (IFIs) in the modern global economy
remains a highly contested issue. The recent Argentinean crisis vividly illustrated the
limited ability of IFIs to hasten the slow resolution of debt overhang, and the perils
associated with external debt in countries with limited fiscal capacity. The questionable
record of World Bank loans to poor countries led to soul searching process regarding the
wisdom of providing credit to developing countries. Some argue for sweeping remedies,
including minimizing the role of IFIs due to the resultant moral hazard, as well as
channeling help to poor countries as grants instead of loans (see Meltzer (2000) and
Easterly (2003)). A more radical view argues that the deeper financial globalization
nullifies the beneficial role of IFIs, intensifying the residual moral hazard associated with
the IFIs, and questioning the legitimacy of these organizations.
This paper cautions “Don't throw the baby out with the bath water” -- there is a
risk of going overboard with the criticism of the IFIs. Specifically, IFIs may be
instrumental in facilitating reforms and in adopting better management schemes in
circumstances where political economy factors inhibit the governance capacity of the
country. While accomplishing governance reform is harder than providing unconditional
credit lines, there are situations where the IFIs retain an important role that could not be
replaced by private financial markets. The limited ability to help developing countries in
a crisis [ex post], should shift the focus of IFIs to involvement aimed ex-ante at reducing

2
the probability of a crisis. Such steps would also be beneficial in alleviating, ex-post, the
depths of a crisis. We illustrate this with the help of two examples. The first focuses on
managing escrow accounts of buffer funds by the IFIs, needed in order to deal with
governance problems that may inhibit the formation of these funds in some developing
countries. The second studies the IFIs role as “the lender of last resort” to support fiscal
restructuring.
In section 1 we discuss the possible role of IFIs in facilitating escrow accounts of
international reserves. As the experience of Chile, Korea and other countries vividly
illustrate, international reserves may be used as a buffer fund, providing useful self
insurance. This self insurance is valuable even if agents are risk neutral, in circumstances
where the cost of public funds is high in recessions, and low in economic expansions [see
Aizenman and Marion (2004)]. The buffer fund may be financed by both past fiscal
savings and external borrowing. Yet, political polarization and political instability may
curtail drastically the usefulness and optimal size of the buffer fund, as it is a convenient
target for future opportunistic policy makers. Extending Aizenman and Marion (2004),
we illustrate that some of the obstacles inhibiting the use of buffer funds may be
overcome if these funds are run as escrow accounts managed by the IFIs. By offering
above market yields on such accounts, IFIs may have the leverage encouraging
developing countries to tame external borrowing, and to increase their fiscal savings.
Such a policy would be welfare enhancing in circumstances where decentralized external
borrowing leads to over borrowing, as the case tends to be when partial default entails
deadweight losses due to enforcement costs, bank runs, etc. Our model can be extended
to allow for investment, illustrating that political instability and polarization reduce
investment. The proposed escrow account may alleviate some of the costs associated
with low saving and investment.
The practical purpose of the proposed scheme is to deal with the challenges facing
resource rich developing countries. In the absence of internal management problems,
efficiency calls for increasing savings in “good times,” augmenting the resources
available in future “bad times.” Examples of these concerns are oil producing countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa. While one hope that the recent spike in oil prices would induce
higher saving, political economy considerations and civil wars inhibit savings. The

3
Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development & Pipeline Project provides an interesting case
study of an escrow account plan, designed to deal with some of these issues. The plan
was designed with the help and partially financed by the World Bank. The news release
“Payment From Chad’s First Oil Sale Deposited in Escrow Account” summarizes the
scheme:
“ … The payment was made on the first sale of oil shipped from the Kribi terminal off the coast of Cameroon
in October. The Doba oil field and the 1,070-kilometer pipeline through Cameroon to the Kribi facility were
completed a year ahead of schedule and oil began flowing in July. The project is expected to generate $2.0
billion over 25 years for Chad, and the government is committed to using most of these revenues for poverty
reduction, as set out in a revenue management law passed by parliament in 1999. In addition to financing
Chad’s participation in the Doba oil field project, the World Bank also advised the government on a
transparent revenue management structure to direct the proceeds of oil sales to poverty reduction efforts.
Under the oil revenue management law, the proceeds of oil sales, after payment of administrative fees and
debt service, are then transferred to commercial banks in Chad and allocated as follows:
Ten percent of royalties and dividends are placed in a Future Generations Fund, and the remaining 90% are
allocated as follows:
·
Five percent is earmarked for regional development in the Doba oil field area.
·
Eighty percent are to be directed to education, health and social services, rural development,
infrastructure and water management projects.
·
Fifteen percent are allocated to the Treasury current account
Withdrawals from these accounts can only be authorized by an oversight committee, which comprises
members of civil society, parliament, the Supreme Court and government. The account is to be audited
annually and the results regularly published…”
World Bank News Release No: 2004/166/AFR

Our model suggests that such schemes may alleviate agency problems, and in
some cases may be useful in encouraging the external financing and the technical help
needed to facilitate the success of investment projects.
Section 2 illustrates the role of IFIs in supporting fiscal restructuring in a
modified Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellini (1992) model. Specifically, they considered
an economy where there is greater inertia in reforming the overall efficiency of the tax
system, than in changing the fiscal policy. They showed that even if changing the
efficiency of the tax system is costless, high enough polarization and political instability
induces the present administration to choose an inefficient tax system, left as a legacy to
tie the hands of future administrations. Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellini’s (1992)
outcome reflects a competitive design of policies: each policy maker is setting the fiscal
efficiency for the next period, ignoring any strategic interaction in the future. We show
that even with a high degree of polarization, there are conditions under which tacit
cooperation may be supported. This is accomplished by a trigger strategy, where the
threat to revert to a highly inefficient fiscal system may induce all administrations to
support a greater fiscal efficiency than the one outlined in Cuikerman at. al. (1992). Yet,

4
this rosy scenario may be unattainable in circumstances where changing the fiscal
capacity is costly -- the limited present fiscal capacity implies that the cost of public
funds may be prohibitive. In these cases, the IFIs may have an important role in
alleviating this financing trap, facilitating the investment in improving fiscal capacities.
Section 4 concludes the paper with interpretive remarks.
1. International reserves escrow accounts
We consider a two-period model of an emerging-market economy. The economy
experiences productivity shocks that create a volatile tax base. It faces inelastic fiscal
outlays and finds it costly to collect taxes. The economy can borrow internationally in
the first period, but because there is some chance it will default in the second period, it
may face a credit ceiling.
1.1. Output
Suppose that productivity shocks occur only in the second period. Then GDP
in period i (i = 1, 2) is
Y1 = 1
Y2 = 1 + ε

(1.1)

where ε is a productivity shock defined in the range − δ ≤ ε ≤ δ ; 0 ≤ δ , with a
corresponding density function f (ε ) .
1.2. International Borrowing
The emerging market can borrow in international capital markets. Suppose it
borrows B in period 1 at a contractual rate r , so it owes (1+ r)B in period 2. If it faces a
bad enough productivity shock in the second period, it defaults. International creditors
can confiscate some of the emerging market’s export revenues or other resources equal to
a share α of its output. We assume that the defaulting country’s international reserve

holdings are beyond the reach of creditors.1
1

This is a realistic assumption. For example, on January 5, 2002, The Economist reported “[President
Duhalde] confirmed that Argentina will formally default on its debt, an overdue admission of an
inescapable reality. The government has not had access to international credit (except from the IMF) since
July. It had already repatriated nearly all of its liquid foreign assets to avoid their seizure by creditors.”
(The Economist, p. 29). Our main results will hold even if creditors can confiscate a fraction of the
reserves, as long as this fraction is below α.

5
In the second period, the country repays its international obligations if repayment
is less costly than the default penalty. The country ends up transferring S2 real resources
to international creditors in the second period, where:
S 2 = MIN [(1 + r ) B; αY2 ] ,

0 <α <1

(1.2)

Let ε∗ be the value of the shock that causes the emerging market to switch from
repayment to the default regime:2
(1+ r)B = α (1+ ε*)

(1.3)

Thus the future net resource transfer to international creditors will be:
(1 + r ) B if

S2 = 
α (1 + ε ) if


ε >ε *
(1.4)

ε ≤ε *

Suppose the risk-free interest rate is rf . The international credit market is risk neutral,
characterized by competition among banks that are fully informed regarding the debt
exposure of the country. Partial default by the emerging market requires that banks
should spend real resources µ in order to verify the productivity shock and to enforce the
repayment according to (1.4).3
The interest rate attached to the country’s acquired debt, r , is determined by the
condition that the expected return on the debt, net of enforcement costs, is equal to the
risk-free return:
ε*

δ

∫ [α (1 + ε ) − µ ] f (ε )dε + ∫ (1 + r ) B f (ε )dε = (1 + r f ) B

−δ

(1.5)

ε*

If the worst possible shock ( ε = −δ ) still makes repayment preferable to default, then ε * is set equal to
−δ .
3
To simplify, we lump these costs together and ignore the possibility of randomized monitoring [see
Towsend (1979) for a model where a debt contract is optimal in the presence of state verification costs]. As
was shown by Boyd and Smith (1994), random monitoring adds significant complexity to the financial
contract, without generating first order welfare effects.

Differentiating (1.5) with respect to B, we find that:

d [(1 + r ) B]

where Q =

∫ f (ε )dε is the probability of full repayment.

If there is no chance of default,

ε*

Q = 1 and the country is charged the risk-free rate. But when there is some chance of

default, the country is forced to pay a risk premium, since 0 < Q < 1 implies r > rf .
1.3 The Fiscal Story

The demand for public goods, such as health, pensions, and defense, is assumed
to be completely inelastic and set at G . Public goods expenditures are financed, in part,
by tax revenues. Collecting taxes is assumed to be costly. Costs include direct collection
and enforcement costs as well as indirect deadweight losses associated with the
distortions induced by taxes. Like Barro (1979), we model these costs as a non-linear
share of output and let them depend positively on the tax rate. Thus a tax at rate t yields
net tax revenue of
T (t ) = Y [t − Γ(t )]; Γ' ≥ 0, Γ" ≥ 0.

(1.7)

The term Γ(t) measures the fraction of output lost due to of inefficiencies in the tax
collection system. Γ( t) is assumed to increase at an increasing rate as the tax rate rises.
It is convenient to specify the fiscal demand for net tax revenue as a share of
GDP:

ξi =

Ti
; i = 1, 2
Yi

(1.8)

Combining (1.7) and (1.8), we can express the tax rate as a function of the share of net
tax revenue in GDP:
ti (ξ i ); t ' > 0

(1.9)

7

For example, if the collection cost is quadratic in the tax rate, so that Γ(t ) = 0.5λt 2 where

λ measures the relative inefficiency of the tax system, then
T (t ) = Y [t − 0.5λt 2 ]

(1.10)

and
ti =

1 − 1 − 2λξ i .

λ

(1.11)

1.4 Reserves

The government can acquire international reserves in the first period, let them
earn the risk-free rate, and spend them in the second period. One way of acquiring
reserves is through sovereign borrowing. Even if reserves are acquired as the counterpart
of private-sector borrowing, full sterilization by the central bank implies an ultimate swap
of sovereign debt for reserves.4 Another way of accumulating reserves is through
taxation. Higher taxes depress domestic absorption and generate a bigger current-account
surplus in the first period. In the second period, reserves may be spent to finance
repayment of the international debt and government expenditures. In a two-period model,
there is no need to hold reserves beyond the second period. Thus the terminal demand
for reserves is zero.
The government faces the following budget constraints:
T1 = G + R − B;
T2 = G + S2 − (1+ rf )R

(1.12)

In the first period, spending on public goods and reserve accumulation must be financed
by taxes and foreign borrowing. In the second period, spending on public goods and debt
repayments must be financed by taxes and available reserves.

4

The central bank actively targets the stock of reserves. Even so, a variety of exchange-rate arrangements
are possible, such as a fixed exchange rate or a managed float, because the balance sheets of the central
bank and treasury are consolidated and the net taxes paid by consumers are determined as a residual. This
structure would also apply to the operation of export stabilization funds, such as Chile’s cooper fund.

8
Consumer preferences are characterized by a conventional time-separable utility
function, where ρ is the discount rate:

u(C1 ) +

u (C 2 )
1+ ρ

(1.13)

Consumer spending in each period is merely output net of taxes, where taxes include
collection costs:
Ci = Yi[1− ξ i − Γ(t (ξ i ))];

i = 1,2

5

(1.14)

Given the definition of output in (1.1), consumer spending in period 1 is
C1 = [1− ξ1 − Γ(t(ξ1 ))] while consumer spending in period 2 is
C2 = [1− ξ 2 − Γ(t(ξ 2 ))] (1+ ε ) . For future reference, it is useful to note that the marginal

cost of public funds, − ∂Ci / ∂Ti , can be inferred from (1.14) to be:
1 + Γ ' (ξ )

'

where Γ (ξ ) =

dΓ dt
.
dt dξ

(1.15)

while from (1.8) and (1.12) we know that:

ξ1 =

T1
= G + R − B;
Y1

ξ2 =

T2 G + S 2 − (1 + r f ) R
=
1+ε
Y2

(1.16)

and S 2 is given by (1.4).
If a bad enough shock reduces future output so much that the country defaults
(i.e., if Q < 1), then the country services the eternal debt by paying the default penalty. In
the absence of sufficient international reserve holdings to finance second-period public
expenditures, the country also needs to raise taxes.

5

Applying (7) and the definition of ξ, we know ξYi = Ti = [t i − Γ]Yi . Thus ti = ξ i + Γi , and

Ci = Yi (1 − ti ) = Yi (1 − ξ i − Γi ) .

9
1.5 The political economy story

We consider an economy where interest groups compete for additional fiscal
resources to support their specific agendas. Realized fiscal expenditure is the outcome of
this competition. Interest groups may be represented by cabinet ministers or, in a federal
system, by various state or provincial governors. Such will be the case if interest groups
pursue narrow agendas, and their marginal spending does not directly impact the
representative consumer’s welfare. However, the tax consequences of successful
lobbying efforts will have the usual adverse effect on the consumer’s utility.
The Treasury Minister (TM) is assumed to determine the ultimate fiscal
allocation. We assume two types of Treasury Ministers—soft and tough. A soft one
accommodates all the fiscal demands of the various interest groups up to the limit
imposed by the contemporaneous budget constraint. A tough one forces the interest
groups to adhere to the planned allocation, G . There is uncertainty in period one about
the type of Treasury Minister that will serve in period two. With probability φ the future
Treasury Minister will be tough.
The sequence of events is as follows. In period one, the interest groups determine
their desired second-period demand for fiscal resources. At the beginning of the second
period, the productivity shock and the Treasury Minister’s type are revealed. A soft TM
in the second period will divide the maximum available fiscal resources, net of foreign
debt repayments, among all the interest groups. In that case, aggregate fiscal expenditure
and consumption in the second period will be:
G|Soft 2nd period = (1 + ε ){tm − Γ(tm )} + R(1 + rf ) − S2 ;

(1.17)

C|Soft 2nd period = (1 + ε ){1 − tm }

where t m is the tax rate that maximizes net tax revenue and is obtained by solving

MAX {t − Γ(t )} . For example, with quadratic collection costs,
t m = 1 / λ; Tm = Y / 2λ


1
; Tm = Y [1 − 0.5λ ]


if
if

λ >1
λ ≤1

(1.18)

10

where Tm is the maximum net tax revenue attainable [i.e. Tm = Y {t m − Γ(t m )} ].
If the TM is also soft in the first period, fiscal expenditure in period one will equal
the maximum contemporaneous resources available. This outcome is the result of
assuming interest groups have high discount rates and prefer maximizing first-period
fiscal expenditure. A soft TM will therefore have no incentive to acquire international
reserves and carry them over to the future period. Moreover, a soft TM will borrow in
the first period up to the external credit ceiling, [α − (1 − Q) µ ] /(1 + rf ) . Consequently,
first-period fiscal expenditure and consumption observed with a soft TM are:
G| Soft 1st period = 1{tm − Γ(tm )} +
C| Soft 1st period = 1{1 − tm }

α − (1 − Q) µ
1 + rf

;

(1.19)
.

The public finance problem solved by the soft TM has a trivial solution: maximize the
fiscal outlay in period one. To do so, the first-period TM sets the tax rate at the peak of
the tax Laffer Curve, borrows up to the external credit ceiling, and accumulates no
international reserves.
We turn now to the more complex case, where a tough TM in the first period must
determine the amount of international reserves and foreign debt to acquire in order to
maximize the expected utility of the representative agent. The tough TM does not know
the second-period productivity shock or TM-type, only the distribution of the
productivity shock and the probability of having a particular TM-type. The tough TM‘s
objective is to maximize:

V|Tough 1st period = u[1 − ξ1 − Γ(t (ξ1 ))] +

Inspection of (1.20) reveals that whatever choice the tough TM makes about first-period
external debt and reserve holdings, it will not affect expected future utility should the soft
TM be in office next period (the last term in (1.20)). The tough TM in the initial period
set policies satisfying the following first-order conditions:

1+ ρ

Inspection of (1.21) and (1.22) reveals that political uncertainty about whether the future
Treasury Minister will be soft or tough induces today’s tough TM to reduce the shadow
real interest rate on borrowing and international reserves from 1 + rf to φ (1 + rf ) . If the
country operates in the range where saving increases with the real interest rate and
borrowing depends negatively on its expected cost, the higher probability of a soft future
governor will lead to higher borrowing and lower international reserves accumulation in
period 1.
The rationale for holding reserves is to increase tomorrow's buying power,
shifting fiscal resources from period one to period two. The greater the probability of
having a soft TM in the future (a small φ ), the smaller the weight attached to the benefit
of having high reserves in the future to increase purchasing power. With probability
(1− φ ) the reserves will be appropriated—or looted-- by a soft TM who will distribute
them to various interest groups via higher fiscal expenditure.
Similarly, the greater the probability of having a soft TM in the future, the more
borrowing a tough TM will undertake today. Greater borrowing today increases future
debt service and reduces the resources left for the soft TM to distribute.
The political instability leads to a second best environment, where the tough TM
scales back the precautionary demand for reserves to reduce future looting. This situation

12
can be partially alleviated if a third party, say the IFIs, would manage some of the
international reserves for the developing country, in escrow accounts that can be used
only if preset conditions apply. These conditions may specify that the international
reserves should supplement the regular taxes to finance fiscal expenditure G, but would
be reimbursed to the tax payer if the authorities were to finance a new set of opportunistic
activities which were not part of pre-set fiscal expenditure.6
To illustrate the impact of the scheme, we turn to the simplest case of two states
of nature, quadratic cost of tax collection, and the absence of verification costs, µ = 0.
Specifically, assume that future output will either be high (1 + δ), or low (1-δ), with
probability one-half of each event. Suppose that a fraction ω of reserves is to be held in
an escrow account. The first order condition for optimal hoarding of reserves and
borrowing in an internal equilibrium with borrowing is:

higher curves correspond to the case where a fraction 0.1 of the international reserves is
put into the escrow account, and the lower curves correspond to no escrow account. In
the absence of political risk, the precautionary demand for reserves is sizable, and it
matches the external borrowing in our base example. Political risk, in the form of higher
probability of the soft TM reduces the demand for international reserves, and increases
external borrowing. Political risk impacts the precautionary saving of IR much more than
external borrowing – precautionary saving is more subject to the future abuse of
opportunistic behavior, as it shifts resources to the future. The introduction of a modest
escrow account mitigates the drop in the demand for international reserves, and increases
the external borrowing. Deeper provision to the escrow account [higher ω] shifts both
curves up, mitigating the drop in the precautionary savings of IR, and increasing the
external borrowing.

Table 1 reports comparative statics of a simulation where future GDP follows a
normal distribution, truncated at ± 2 *standard deviation. The δn parameter reported in
Table 1 is the distance from the center of the distribution to the truncation, and it equals
twice the standard deviation if the distribution were normal, not truncated. Greater
openness, higher volatility, higher fiscal expenditure and lower enforcement costs
increase the optimal international reserves and borrowing. More costly tax collection and
lower political risk increase the optimal self insurance (i.e., higher international reserves),
and lower borrowing.

variance of the second period output is 0.0484.
The optimal design of policies is more complex when default on the external debt
would entail monitoring costs, µ > 0. In these circumstances, the competitive equilibrium

developing country would benefit by taxing external borrowing, inducing the private

country to follow this policy may be accomplished if the IFIs would subsidize the return
on the escrow account of countries reducing their reliance of external borrowing (e.g.,
taking external borrowing). Such a policy would increase the international reserves
portion funded by domestic savings, instead of costly external borrowing.

Designing and financing fiscal reforms

The base model is taken from Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellini (1992), which
explains the obstacles to tax reforms in polarized countries, characterized by political
instability. The economy at time t is described by two budget constraints: the
government, (2.1) and the private sector, (2.2):
g t + f t ≤ τ t (1 − θ t −1 ) + s t

(2.1)

ct ≤ 1 − τ t − s t − δ (τ t ) − γ ( st ) .

(2.2)

Each individual is endowed with one unit of output in each period. The variables g t ; f t
represent two different public goods [say guns and butter] in per capita terms, and ct is
per-capita private consumption. The government collects from each individual an
amount s t , in the form of seigniorage and an amount τ t of tax revenue. A fraction of the
tax revenue is wasted due to tax-collection costs, whereas seigniorage carries no
7

We assume that the sovereign default decision is centralized [e.g., done by the government], and that the
partial debt service following the default decision is done by the governmental agency using taxes. In these
circumstances, the competitive equilibrium leads to over borrowing due to the presence of a distortion akin
to a congestion externality. Each agent is price taker, ignoring the impact of marginal borrowing on
increasing the probability of default, and thereby increasing the deadweight loss associated with the
expected enforcement cost, µ[1 − Q ] . It can be shown that, for µ > 0 , the optimal policy is external
borrowing tax at a rate proportionate to the elasticity of supply of credit facing the economy [for further
details, see Aizenman and Turnovskey (2002)].

16
administrative costs. Both taxes and seigniorage impose convex deadweight losses on
the private sector, equal to δ (τ t ); γ ( st ) , satisfying δ ' > 0, δ " > 0, γ ' > 0, γ " > 0 .
The efficiency of the tax system is measured by θ t −1 . A lower value of

θ t −1 implies a more efficient tax system. To capture the greater inertia in reforming the
tax system than in changing fiscal policy, Cukierman et. al (1992) assume that the tax
efficiency, θ , but not the other policy variables ( τ t ; st ; g t ; f t ), must be chosen one
period in advance. Thus, θ t −1 was chosen at time t-1, but exerts an influence on taxcollection costs only at time t. In order to focus on the strategic role of tax inefficiency,
the authors assume that the cost of a fiscal reform, setting θ t , is zero. There are two
possible policymaker types, L and R, who randomly alternate in office. The policy
maker of type i, i = L, R maximizes welfare:

[

]

∞

wit = Et ∑ β k U (ct + k ) + H i ( g t + k , f t + k )  ; 1 > β > 0 ,
 k =0


(2.3)

where Et denotes the expectation operator, U is concave utility function. The utility from
consuming g and f, H i , is defined as follows,


1
 min[αg , (1 − α ) f ];
H L ( g , f ) = 
 α (1 − α ) 
1>α > 0.

(2.3’)



1
 min[(1 − α ) g , αf ];
H R ( g , f ) = 
 α (1 − α ) 
Thus, the two policy makers differ only in the desired composition of the public
good, with their disagreement is parameterized by α − 0.5 . By construction, the overall
weight given to private versus public consumption does not depend on the disagreement
parameter, α.
The political system is described as a Markov process with transition probabilities

π and 1 – π : the government in office at time t has a fixed probability 1 – π of being

17
reappointed next period. With probability π, it is thrown out of office and the other
policymaker type is appointed.
Let x ≡ g + f denote the total amount of government spending. For concreteness,
we assume α > 0.5 . Proposition 1 in Cuikierman at. al. (1992) shows that the optimal
choices of consumption, aggregate public good, seigniorage and taxes are all a function
of the efficiency of the tax system:

c* = C (θ ); x* = X (θ ); s* = S (θ ); τ * = T (θ );

(2.4)

satisfying C ' (θ ) > 0; X ' (θ ) < 0; S ' (θ ) > 0; T ' (θ ) < 0 , where z* denote the optimal value
of z. The equilibrium value of the tax rate chosen, θ , is shown to satisfies the first order
condition:

1−α 


X ' (θ ) ≤ 0

(2.5)

which holds with equality if θ > 0 . The main results of the model are summarized in
proposition 2 in Cuikerman at. al (1992), stating that
I.

If the current government is certain of being reappointed or if there is no
polarization, than it always brings about the most efficient tax system (if

π = 0 or α = 0.5 , then θ = 0 ).
II.

With a sufficient degree of political instability or polarization, a more
inefficient system would be preferred. Above a threshold of political
instability or of polarization, the lower the probability that the current
government will remain in office and the greater the polarization, the more
inefficient is the tax system left as a legacy to future administration.
The equilibrium characterized above reflects competitive setting of policies: each

policy maker is setting the fiscal efficiency for the next period, ignoring any strategic
interaction in the future. We extend the above model by allowing for potential gains

18
from ‘tacit collusion’ among L and R, supported by a trigger strategy. This possibility is
summarized in the following Claim:

Claim 1

Consider an economy characterized by a sufficient degree of political instability
or polarization, inducing an inefficient tax system in the competitive equilibrium outlined
above, θ * > 0 . If regimes persist ( π < 0.5 ), there exists a trigger strategy equilibrium
~

~
associated with θ ; θ * > θ . In this equilibrium the time t policy maker sets θ t +1 = θ ;
~
any future deviation from θ t +1 = θ will trigger reverting to the competitive

equilibrium, θ = θ * . The new equilibrium increases the expected utility of the policy
maker in charge at time t.
Proof

If L is setting policies today, the competitive setting of fiscal reform in Cuikerman et. al.

Implied in the strategic choice, is the recognition that if the fiscal regime chosen today
would be supported by all future policy makers, the optimal choice of the present policy
maker entails optimizing the discounted expected utility of the entire future, and not only
the next period. We denote by Wi , j the expected utility of policy maker i (i = L, R) in a
period where the policy maker holds the legislative power (j = P), or is out of office (j =
O), evaluated for an arbitrary θ set for the indefinite future. Applying the Markov nature
of the model, it follows that

Discussion

-

Claim 1 implies that, under the assumptions of Cuikerman et. al. (1992), polarized

countries characterized by regime persistence will benefit by fiscal reforms that would
adopt fiscal efficiency above the one predicted by the competitive solution [i.e, where

θ = θ * ]. The higher fiscal efficiency is supported by the trigger strategy associated with
a permanent switch to the inefficient fiscal regime.
-

One should qualify this result by noting that Cukierman et. al. (1992)

conveniently assumed that the cost of the fiscal reform is zero. In practice, one expects
the set up cost of the reform to be significant, involving both a fixed cost, and a cost that
increases with the depth of the fiscal reform. Reform costs imply that, in circumstances
where the deadweight losses of segniorage and taxes were high, the fiscal reform would
not be implemented. This would be the case even if the direct fiscal cost of the reform,
say RC , were small enough such that a modified cost benefit condition continued to
hold:
(2.9”)
~
(1 − π )Wi , P (θ ) + 
(1 − π )Wi , P (θ *) + 

 < U (C (θ −1 )) + X (θ −1 ) + β 
~
πWi ,O (θ )

πWi ,O (θ *)


In these circumstances, if the existing fiscal inefficiencies were high enough, the total
cost of raising RC (inclusive of the deadweight loses associated with collecting RC )
would reverse the above inequality. Thus, the fiscal inefficiency imposes a financing
trap: starting with an inefficient fiscal system, implementing a costly fiscal reform may
be equivalent to the Baron Munchausen’s attempt to rescue himself out the swamp by
pulling his own hair… Short of being able to borrow externally, the reform is
prohibitively costly in the short run. Yet, the political polarization and instability
frequently imply that private creditors would shy away from lending to the country. This
suggests that IFIs may have a constructive role in supplying the seed resources needed to

23
support the fiscal reform. Since the private capital market would shy away from such a
country, IFIs are practically the lenders of last resort to finance fiscal reform.8
Our analysis deals with the case where regime persistency implies that the present
policy maker expects to benefit in his tenure from any fiscal reform he undertakes. The
analysis is more involved in the absence of persistence. If the probability of remaining in
power is less than half, each policy maker is in the “lame duck” position. The above
model suggests that the strategic behavior of each policy maker would increase the fiscal
inefficiency above that of the competitive outcome. When the distortions associated with
seigniorage and the income tax are large, and the policy maker is a “lame duck”, the
equilibrium entails high fiscal inefficiency and relative low provision of aggregate public
~
good [high θ and low x]. 9 Even in these unfavorable circumstances, the message of our
analysis holds; though deeper fiscal reform would be needed. Specifically, it can be
shown that an administration that would adopt both efficient fiscal regime [low θ ] and
lower fiscal expenditure bias [i.e., reducing f − g ] would increase its expected utility,
and the new outcome would be supported by the next administration. As before, this
option would not be viable if fiscal reforms were costly, short of IFIs involvement.

8

Implicitly, this argument hinges on the superior capacity of IFIs relative to the private creditors to prevent
abusing this financing to meet opportunistic expenditure instead of financing the fiscal reforms, and the
capacity to provide technical help in implementing the reform.
9
This follows from the observation that the sign of (2.10’) is reversed for π < 0.5, hence the strategic

~

design of policies would induce adopting θ > θ .

Concluding remarks

This paper argues that developing countries characterized by polarization and
policy instability opt to adopt policies leading to an inefficient tax system, over
borrowing, and under saving. In these circumstances, easy access of the developing
country to credit lines would backfire, and IFIs would have limited capacity in mitigating
ex-post the adverse implications of financial crises triggered by over borrowing and
under saving. Yet, there may be an important role for IFIs involvement in ameliorating
the ex-ante fiscal exposure of the developing country. The IFIs may provide escrow
account services to the central bank of the developing country, in order to reduce the
prospect that buffer funds (including international reserves) may be used
opportunistically by future policy makers. This role is akin to Liabson (1998)’s proposal
of setting saving programs (like 401k) as a mechanism dealing with the under saving
bias. The IFIs may also help by financing and helping in implementing fiscal reforms at
times when the risk characteristics of the country induce private lenders to minimize their
exposure. All these suggestions reflect the second best nature of the environment, and
have a lesser role in countries characterized by better functioning institutions. However,
such institutions may be harder to implement precisely when they are needed: when the
country is polarized and subject to political instability. Hence, the above suggestions
may help as a imperfect substitute for the missing institutions, or for the inability of the
present institutional set up to cope with the political pressure induced by polarization and
policy instability.
