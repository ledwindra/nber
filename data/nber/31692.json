    "abstract": "\n\nIn today\u2019s digital economy, firms near constantly collect, analyze, and profit from consumers\u2019 personal information, which might expose consumers to financial fraud. We examine the effects of Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy, which significantly curtailed data collection and sharing on the iOS platform. Using zip code level variation in iOS user shares, we show that ATT substantially reduced fraud complaints. The effects are concentrated in complaints that have more relevant narratives and in complaints about companies engaging in intensive consumer surveillance and lacking data safeguards. Our evidence quantifies one of the main harms of lax privacy standards.\n\n",
