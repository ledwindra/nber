“Forget any idea of career-long employment with a big company.”
Time, November 22, 1993, p. 37

1. Introduction
During the past decade, the U.S. labor market has undergone considerable change,
especially as increased international competition and continued technological innovation have
created pressures for firms to reduce labor costs substantially. In reporting on these events, it is
rare for a week to go by without headlines about plant closings, layoffs, or restructurings. The
prevailing wisdom in media accounts is that many workers who had been sheltered from layoffs in
earlier decades are no longer protected. Particular attention has been paid to layoffs of white
collar workers, workers employed in large corporations, and workers in the middle of their
careers.1 Media accounts focus on the plight of middle-aged and older workers, who now
account for a larger share of job losers than they did in the past.2
This perception also shows up in surveys of public opinion. Church (1993) reports that in
a Time-CNN poll in 1993, two-thirds thought that job security was worse than it was two years
ago (when the unemployment rate was the same) and 53 percent thought that this problem will
last for many years. In a poll conducted as part of the weeklong New York Times (1996) series,
46 percent of the respondents said they were worried about becoming unemployed and 72 percent

The following quote from the weeklong series “The Downsizing of America” in the New York Times (1996) captures
much of today’s prevailing wisdom (italics added for emphasis): “More than 43 million jobs have been erased in the
United States since 1979 … Many of the losses come from the normal churning as stores fail and factories move. And
far more jobs have been created than lost over that period. But increasingly the jobs that are disappearing are those of
higher-paid, white-collar workers, many at large corporations, women as well as men, many at the peak of their
careers. Like a clicking odometer on a speeding car, the number twirls higher nearly each day. … What distinguishes
this age are three phenomena: white-collar workers are big victims; large corporations now account for many of the
layoffs, and a large percentage of the jobs are lost to "outsourcing" -- contracting out work to another company,
usually within the United States.”

The widely-cited New York Times (1996) report has a graphic showing the share of laid off workers under age 30 had
fallen from 40 to 25 percent between 1981-83 and 1991-93. The share of laid off workers age 30 to 50 rose from 44 to
56 percent.

2
thought that layoffs were a permanent problem.
To determine whether jobs have become less stable in the 1990s, economists have
examined household data from nationally representative surveys, focusing on mobility and job
tenure. For the most part, these studies find only small changes in job mobility and employment
tenure. The difference between public perception, largely based on media accounts of layoffs at
large companies, and statistical evidence, using representative national samples of workers, can be
rationalized in two ways: either the media accounts are anecdotes that would not add up
consistently when viewed from a more systematic framework (a conclusion reached by Neumark
and Polsky (1998)) or the statistical studies have missed something big because they have not
properly looked at some of the variables emphasized in popular discussions.
This paper provides the first detailed analysis of job stability in large corporations in the
1990s, paying particular attention to the situation of midcareer workers. Given the public
perception of rising instability in worker-firm attachments and the emphasis on large firms in
media accounts, this paper starts with a basic question: in large firms, what has happened to
employer tenure and the percentage of workers in long-term jobs in the 1990s? This is a
measurement issue, which we address with a data set consisting of 51 large firms that are clients
of Watson Wyatt Worldwide. Some of the firms in this sample have been included in media
accounts of downsizing. If job security for workers at the peak of their careers in large firms has
become a relic of labor history, then one would expect to see noticeable changes in the tenure
distribution and in the percentage of persons in long-term jobs in this sample – if not across-theboard, certainly in firms that have downsized over the sample period.
This paper begins in Section 2 with a brief review of recent empirical studies of tenure and

3
mobility, followed by a theoretical discussion in Section 3 of why firms might have changed their
decision rules for layoffs in the 1990s. The leading explanations are a change in the way the stock
market reacts to layoff announcements or an increased incentive to substitute younger for older
workers. Section 4 explains some unique features of our data set and assesses its strengths and
limitations. Summary statistics are discussed in detail, as they go to the very heart of the matter
of what has happened to job stability in large firms in the 1990s. But such statistics can only take
us so far. Simple comparisons between growing and downsizing firms will be misleading if
employment growth is correlated with other key determinants of job stability such as labor cost
and simple comparisons say nothing at all about age-substitution. Section 5 reports regression
analysis that provides more definitive results on these issues. Section 6 summarizes the key
results and discusses some unresolved issues.
2. Conflicting perceptions
It seems obvious: tenure is declining, jobs are riskier, retention rates are falling, and
mobility is increasing. To be convinced of these trends, one need only read the newspapers (e.g.,
New York Times (1996)), any business magazine (e.g., Pennar (1996) in Business Week, Lieber
(1996) and Munk (1999) in Fortune), or some of the numerous trendy books (e.g., Bluestone and
Harrison (1986), Belous (1989), Moore (1996), and Reich (1997)) analyzing the changing
business environment in the U.S. Generally, these reports are based on specific instances of
individual firms announcing layoffs, downsizing, or closings. Most of the firms described in these
reports are very large, nationally known corporations. Most of the job losers described in these
accounts are workers in their 40s and 50s who had a long-term attachment with their employer.
After reading enough of these reports, it is easy to become convinced that there is a new reality in

4
the U.S. labor market -- workers must anticipate more frequent job changes, constant fear of
being laid off, and the inability to retain a career job for much of their worklife.
Is this perception of U.S. labor market fact or fiction? The perception is based on news
accounts of the actions of large firms; firms with fewer than 10,000 employees rarely appear on
the cover of Newsweek. There has been no effort to systematically aggregate the experience of
large firms into a general pattern of change. Instead, the accumulation of reports is taken as
confirmation of the increase in instability; that is, enough media accounts presenting examples of
layoffs by large employers provides a representative picture of the 1990s labor market.
To test the validity of this perception, economists have examined survey data on job
duration and job changes, using data sets such as the Current Population Survey (CPS) or the
Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID) that are representative of the entire labor market.
These surveys include employees from firms of all size categories. Studies based on these surveys
have not attempted to focus on large firms, in part because the data often do not include measures
of firm size and in part because of the difficulties in making comparisons across time within firm
size categories with repeated cross sections. A brief summary of these studies is not consistent
with the popular belief that employment tenure has sharply declined and job mobility has increased
during the past two decades.
(1) Employer tenure: McGill, et al. (1996) compared median years in current job for men
and women by age groups between 1951 and 1991 and concluded "disaggregation of the
historical data on worker tenure does not support the general notion that workers have become
inherently more job mobile in recent years." Their analysis used job tenure by age-sex group as
reported in various government publications. The data showed that the median years in the

5
current job for men in each age group were higher in 1991 than in 1966. Median years in the
current job for women were also higher in each age group. Subsequent tabulations of the
February 1996 CPS by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (1997) indicate that median years of
tenure for men declined by 0.1 years between 1991 and 1996, but median tenure for women rose
by 0.3 years.
(2) Percentage of workers in long-term jobs: Farber (1997) finds that the proportion of
men reporting long-term jobs (more than 10 years or more than 20 years) declined slightly
between 1979 and 1993 and then more substantially between 1993 and 1996. In contrast, there
was a small increase in the proportion of women reporting long-term employment relationships.
Farber concludes, "the structure of the employment relationship in some areas may have changed
toward a model with less long-term job security. However, the analysis of the data on displaced
workers suggests that, to the extent that this has occurred, the mechanism may not be to target
high-tenure workers for layoff but may be to structure the base employment relationship different
ways earlier in jobs."
(3) Mobility: Studies comparing the distribution of employer tenure across different waves
of the CPS show job mobility has remained relatively constant over the past two decades.
Diebold, Neumark, and Polsky (1997) report that retention rates declined slightly from 0.544
between 1983-87 to 0.530 between 1987-1991 and when retention rates are adjusted for the
business cycle, the decline in retention rates is only from 0.537 to 0.527. They report, "the most
important conclusion to emerge from our study is the approximate stability of aggregate job
retention rates over the 1980s and early 1990s.....Taken as a whole, the evidence from 4-year job
retention rates estimated over this period does not point toward a secular decline in job stability."

6
Extending this work through 1995, Neumark, Polsky and Hansen (1997) found that the four-year
retention rate for all workers was slightly higher for 1991-95 (0.544) than for 1987-91 and 198487.
Findings from research using the PSID are more diverse. Rose (1996) finds increases in
job turnover in the 1980s compared to the 1970s, whereas Polsky (1996), comparing 1976-81 to
1986-91, finds no evidence of a change in the likelihood of job separation. Jaeger and Stevens
(1998) and Gottschalk and Moffitt (1998) carefully examine the PSID data and benchmark it
against the CPS and SIPP, respectively. Their studies both conclude that there has been no trend
toward increased job stability.
None of these studies using household surveys has been able to distinguish among workers
based on the size of their employers. Thus, one possible explanation for the difference in
perceptions is that the press accounts have concentrated on the actions of large firms while the
research studies have examined all workers. Since almost 60 percent of all workers are employed
by firms with fewer than 1,000 employees, this distinction could be very important in explaining
the different conclusions concerning trends in job tenure and mobility. The popular perception of
greater instability in large firms could be consistent with the academic findings of no overall
change in stability if jobs in large (small) firms have become less (more) stable. This study
provides direct evidence on job stability for large employers in the 1990s using the best possible
data – firm employment records.
The measures of job duration used in this study all come from company payroll records
that are used in conjunction with their compensation systems. Payroll records are not subject to
any of the sources of erroneous measurement of employer tenure found in household surveys:

7
imperfect recall by the worker, guesstimates by other household members on behalf of the
worker, and rounding errors.3
Household survey data are not well suited for examining labor market policies of large
employers. Firm size is not regularly included in household surveys, so inferences have to be
drawn by comparing tenure distributions at two points in time. Comparing the number of
employees with x years of tenure in year t in large firms to the number with x+n years of tenure in
year t+n in large firms is problematic in a household survey for two reasons: (1) errors in
reporting employment levels and (2) movement of firms over and under the thousand-employee
threshold during the n years. Employer data will provide much more accurate measures of
changes in the tenure distribution.
Another big advantage of employer data is that it permits an in-depth examination of firms
that are changing size. Of special interest to the current debate is the ability to focus on large
firms that are shrinking and to distinguish their behavior from firms that are growing. Press
accounts of reductions in force usually emphasize cuts in the total number of jobs. But what
actually happens in large companies undergoing, say, a 10 percent reduction in force? Are firms
reacting to adverse economic events by pushing more expensive, older workers out the door or
are they responding by reducing or halting the hiring of new employees? To answer this question,
one must have data from employers to be able to determine retention rates by age and tenure and
to calculate the cost of employing workers at various age and tenure levels.
The advantages of using employer data to examine labor market practices do not come
without costs. One issue is whether the firms in any sample are representative of large employers

that have traditionally offered lifetime jobs. To address this concern, we present as much
descriptive detail about the firms as possible and compare their characteristics to known values of
key traits from national data. Nonetheless the results of this study should be interpreted as a case
study of 51 firms with almost a million employees that may or may not be generalizable across all
large firms. An additional limitation of the sample used here is that the information on worker
characteristics is limited to age, tenure, and compensation. Although this prohibits any
breakdowns by schooling, gender, or race, it should not produce any bias in our estimates; pay
level can be used to control for variations in skill.
3. Theoretical framework
Tenure distributions and mobility decisions in each firm reflect the joint decision making of
the firm and its employees. Firms base decisions about the size and composition of their labor
force on demand for the firm’s product, production technology, the cost of hiring and training
workers, the cost of firing workers, and the cost and substitutability of various types of labor and
other inputs. In addition to comparing current and expected future costs and productivity, firms
take into account strategic considerations, including the value of the ability to write contracts for
long-term jobs. Employees base their decisions on employment opportunities elsewhere in the
labor market relative to those in the firm, as well as on the perceived value of nonmarket
activities.
To understand possible changes in the 1990s in long-term employment contracts, a model
must be able to explain why a firm would consider reneging on such a contract and why employer
behavior in the 1990s would differ from earlier decades. Traditionally firms have employed a
combination of FIFO layoffs and early retirement policies to reduce the number of workers. This

9
practice is explained by a simple model of specific human capital in which the worker and the firm
share the investment costs and the expected returns from increased productivity following
training.4 During the training period, workers are paid less than the wage they are offered by
competing firms (the investment cost to the worker) but more than the value of what they
produce net of training costs (the investment cost to the firm). After training is completed,
workers are paid less than the value of their output (firm return on investment) but more than
their alternative wage (worker return on investment).
At the initial point of the employment relationship, there are no rents from training
accruing to either party. As training continues, the present value of rents over time (for the
worker, the firm, and both rents combined) follows a quadratic pattern. This pattern occurs
because the remaining length of the investment period (a period of net costs to the worker and
firm) is declining, some investment costs have already been made and thus, are now viewed as
fixed costs. In addition, the length of time remaining in the training period is declining so that the
time until positive investment returns for both the worker and the firm are expected is also
declining.
The present value of future rents for each party reaches a maximum at the end of the
training period and then begins to decline. During this period, output is greater than
compensation which is greater than the compensation that workers could earn with their current
skills at other firms. As years go by, the present value of rents for the remaining work life with
the firm decline and eventually become zero at the end of the relationship.
With an adverse shock to the firm that is neutral across age and tenure categories, the

The discussion here follows closely the exposition in Lazear (1995, 1998).

10
entire rent profile shifts downward. The present value of future rents becomes negative at the
tails of the tenure distribution. This would dictate a downsizing strategy focusing on the most
junior and most senior employees. Firms would use a combination of first-in-first-out (FIFO)
layoffs and buyout packages for more senior workers, with the mix depending on the shape of the
tenure distribution and the size of the shock. In this framework, the only rationale for eliminating
midcareer employees generating peak rents would be a shock that is biased to be more severe for,
say, the top half of age/tenure distribution than for the bottom half.
Downsizing strategies dictating layoffs of midcareer workers can be explained in the
context of Lazear’s (1979) model. Even in good times, the present value of future rents is
negative for all workers beyond a certain tenure level and is most negative for the most senior
workers. Normally firms resist the temptation to layoff the most senior workers because they
want to maintain a good reputation in the labor market, meaning simply that they value the option
of writing more such productivity-enhancing contracts in the future. Yet in some situations, such
as a decision to permanently drop product lines, outsource operations or implement labor-saving
technology, an endgame situation arises where reputational concerns are overshadowed by the
prospect of increased profitability. In such cases layoffs of midcareer employees would be
economically rational for the firm, regardless of the implicit contract (and stock options can be
used to offset the concerns of the remaining, younger employees).
This still leaves the question of why layoffs of high-tenure workers in large firms started to
attract attention in the 1990s.5 One possibility is the connection between layoff announcements,
stock value, and CEO pay. In an issue of Newsweek with its cover filled with CEOs labelled

5

See Capelli (1998) for a broader survey and an empirical analysis of which firms were most likely to downsize.

11
“Corporate Killers,” Sloan (1996) proclaimed: “Once upon a time, it was a mark of shame to fire
your workers en masse. It meant you had messed up your business. Today, the more people a
company fires, the more Wall Street loves it, and the higher the stock price goes.” Theoretically
the impact of such announcements on stock prices is indeterminate (Worrell et al. (1991)). They
could have a neutral effect if the company’s problems were well known and the layoffs were
expected and a negative effect if the layoffs were not expected or greater than expected.6 For the
reaction to be positive (the popular perception today), the market must interpret the news as a
sign that the firm was no longer in denial and was making the appropriate correction.
If there has been a shift in market reactions to layoff announcements, then there will be a
corresponding change in the reward structure for CEOs which would make them more inclined to
downsize.7 Firms would be willing to abrogate implicit contracts for lifetime jobs if the gains in
shareholder wealth offset the losses in specific human capital and reputation in the labor market.
In our data set this would show up in a comparison of growing and downsizing firms or in a
model where turnover for workers in different tenure categories is a function of employment
growth. If they were breaking implicit contracts, downsizing firms not only would have higher
turnover overall, but also higher turnover (relative to growing firms) across all tenure categories,
including mid-career employees. The alternative possibility is that downsizing firms still rely on
FIFO layoffs and early-retirement buyouts, in which case turnover rates would vary at the
extremes of the tenure distribution but not in the middle.

6

Ironically, in earlier decades layoff announcements were seen as a signal of corporate distress and this was the basis for
some of the opposition to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (Worrell et al 1991).
7
Hallock (1998) finds small, negative effects of layoff announcements on share prices and no effect on CEO pay.
Worrell et al. (1991) find stock prices go down after layoff announcements; Cascio et al. (1997) found no overall effect
of downsizing on stock returns, but firms combining downsizing with asset restructuring received higher returns.

12
A second theory for greater job instability involves substitution of younger for older
employees. In a recent story in Fortune titled “Finished at Forty,” Munk (1999) writes
Since the early 1980s big companies have been getting rid of people. For a long time, though, seniority mattered.
Hierarchy was respected too. If people had to be fired, the younger, junior people were usually the first to go. That’s no
longer true. … There’s no way to tell how many of these people are over 40, but this much is sure: Companies today
have less and less tolerance for people they believe are earning more than their output warrants. Such intolerance, or
pragmatism, hits older workers hardest. The older an employee, the more likely it is he can be replaced by someone
younger who earns half as much.

Theoretically, the incentive to substitute younger for older workers is affected by the slope
of the tenure-compensation profile relative to the tenure-productivity profile. Greater global
competition or an increased pace of technological change dictates a need for a more flexible
workforce, according to some management experts. This makes young employees more
attractive in the 1990s because they would supposedly be more willing to relocate or put in long
hours than an older generation juggling child and elder care. The experience-productivity profile
also could have flattened as a result of the increasing use of information technology, assuming that
younger workers are more computer-savvy. The slope of the experience-productivity profile is
not observable, so we focus empirically on the impact of the steepness of the pay profile. It is
well established that wage differentials by experience have widened in the 1980s and 1990s, which
would create a rationale for substituting inexperienced for midcareer workers.
Finally, initial conditions matter. A firm with a relatively large percentage of low-tenure
employees is capable of adjusting to an adverse shock through FIFO layoffs without terminating
any midcareer employees. A firm with very few recent hires does not have this option. To
control for this, we report data by seniority categories and controls for the share of the most
junior (0 to 4) and most senior (25 and up) employees in t-5 in regression models of turnover.
As pointed out by Gokhale, Groshen, and Neumark (1995), there also can be an

13
interaction effect between profile steepness and initial conditions. A firm faced with a large
percentage of older workers and a steep profile would obtain more cost savings through agesubstitution than a firm with the same percentage of older workers and a flat profile. We tested
for such an effect in our data and were unable to reject the null hypothesis. To make the
presentation of the empirical results more compact and easy to follow, these results are not
reported.
Empirically, this study proceeds in the following fashion. First, we examine how tenure
distributions have changed in our sample of firms in the 1990s. Once we get beyond the basic
facts on tenure in the early and middle parts of the decade, we attempt to interpret these facts in
light of the concern about rising job instability. It is difficult to draw inferences about job stability
from simple comparisons of tenure distributions within a firm. An increase in mean tenure does
not imply that workers are sticking around; such an increase will also occur if the firm downsizes
and fires all junior employees. Similarly a decrease in mean tenure could reflect a situation where
a growing firm has extremely low turnover accompanied by an increase in the percentage of new
employees or a situation where midcareer and senior employees have been replaced by younger
workers. Accordingly, we shift attention to the retention rate of workers in different ranges of the
tenure distribution. Retention in this study is measured by comparing the age and tenure
distribution at two points in time; the reasons behind the observed attrition in each age-tenure cell
(quits, layoffs, disability, death) are not reported. In addition to the slope of the pay profile and
the initial distribution of tenure, we model retention on the following variables:
Growing versus downsizing: Worker-initiated decisions on retention will be based on the
difference in the expected value of opportunities within and outside the firm. Because of greater

14
opportunities for promotions and higher-paying positions within growing firms, such firms should
have fewer quits than shrinking firms. Layoffs can occur in both growing and shrinking firms, but
are obviously more likely in the latter. Thus one would expect retention rates to increase with
employment growth.
Downsizing can be done in a variety of different ways and this choice will have important
implications for retention and tenure. Firms that reduce employment through hiring freezes
should have higher retention rates and a greater proportion of workers with long tenure than firms
that target midcareer and senior workers for layoffs. By looking not just at overall retention
rates, but also at retention rates by seniority, this study will be able to give a fuller accounting of
what happens to job stability after downsizing.
Pay level: The level of compensation also will influence decision making by both workers
and employers. Firms with high wages are likely to have fewer quits, holding worker alternatives
constant; they also are likely to have a greater incentive for headcount reductions, holding
productivity constant. Most studies of mobility do find a positive association between wages and
job duration, absent controls for alternative wages and productivity.
Firm size: Company size also should influence retention rates and the incidence of longterm jobs. Even among large firms, the companies with the most employees are more likely to
have greater opportunities internally, and thus greater retention of employees.
4. Data and summary statistics
This study examines changes in job tenure in the 1990s using employment and
compensation information on 51 firms. All of the firms are in the private sector, operate on a for-

15
profit basis, and were consulting clients of Watson Wyatt Worldwide (WWW). WWW is an
international benefit consulting firm that provides a variety of services associated with the
development and maintenance of compensation systems to firms in all sectors of the economy.
WWW markets its services to a wide range of firms; however, most of its clients tend to be firms
with 1,000 or more employees. Most major corporations in the U.S. use some of their services.
These employers are all relatively large firms ranging in size in the initial year from slightly
less than 1,000 employees to almost 200,000 employees. Each of the firms has a defined benefit
pension plan and all of the firms provide health insurance to their employees. The employers are
from the manufacturing, financial, health, transportation, telecommunications, utility, and
information sectors of the economy. These firms do not constitute a random sample of employers
but they are a collection of firms that provide high pay, excellent benefits, and a tradition of
providing long-term employment – exactly the type of firm that has been singled out in media
accounts. The data set was developed by the Research and Information Center of Watson Wyatt
Worldwide in an effort to help clients understand the impact of an aging labor force on individual
firms. The firms included in the data represent companies for whom Watson Wyatt has already
conducted such an analysis, for whom all relevant data were available.8 Cases were dropped when
(1) there were obvious inconsistencies (e.g., retention rates of 125 percent) or (2) when there had
been a major acquisitions or selloffs that precluded a full accounting of employment in all lines of
business before and after the restructuring.

8

Several studies by Watson Wyatt (Schieber and Graig (1995) and McDevitt and Schieber (1996)) analyze the general
aging of the workforce and its implications on the cost and provision of benefits, especially retiree health benefits. The
company developed an analytical model, called the Aging Diagnostic, to estimate the cost of aging on compensation
costs at the individual firm level. This tool was applied to data either as a part of routine ongoing work done for Watson
Wyatt clients or done to make an employer aware of issues raised in the two published reports.

16
The data set includes information on the number of workers employed by age and tenure
for each firm for two years. In each case, the years are five years apart; however, the five-year
period of analysis varies somewhat across the firms, with 24 firms reporting data for 1990-1995,
25 firms reporting data for 1991-1996, and 2 firms reporting data for 1992-1997. Age-tenure
retention rates between the two years are provided along with age-tenure levels of total
compensation for the most recent year. In addition, the data provide age-tenure information
concerning pay, health costs, pension costs, and the cost of paid leave.

48 firms declined by 4.6 percent. The median percentage change in employment for these
employers was –5.4 percent; the unweighted average change in employment was –2.0 percent.

Table 1 presents key employment data for the firms by level of employment. Generally,
total employment among the smaller employers was growing, with the most rapid growth
reported in the very smallest category. Employment among the largest employers was
contracting, with the most significant contraction occurring among the very largest firms.
One would not expect worker characteristics in the large firms examined here to exactly
match those found in household surveys. All but one of the firms in this sample has 1,000 or
more employees. All provide health insurance and retirement benefits. They are not evenly
distributed across industries. Most of the firms are in manufacturing, transportation,
communications, utilities, financial services, and health services. None are in agriculture, mining,
construction, wholesale trade, and services outside of health care. With these provisos in mind,
we examined the April 1993 CPS, which contains a supplemental Survey of Employee Benefits
and is the only large household survey that falls within our sample period and contains information
on firm size and employee benefits (availability of health insurance and retirement plans and
participation in those plans). To re-weight the CPS so that it resembles our sample as closely as
possible, we dropped all observations where (1) the respondent works in a firm with fewer than
1,000 employees, (2) the respondent is not covered by the employer’s health insurance and

18
retirement plans, and (3) the respondent works for the government. Average age was 40.9 in the
first year of the employer sample, which is reasonably close to the value of 40.4 in the CPS
matched sample. Tenure in the employer sample in year t averaged 12.3 years, slightly higher
than the value of 11.6 years in the CPS. The only dimension in which the two samples do not
match up very well is in terms of pay. Pay levels in the employer sample in year t+5 average
$44,521, whereas estimated annual salary in the CPS (52 times weekly salary) is $35,318. The
pay discrepancy may result from differences in industry mix between the CPS and the WWW
sample or underrepresentation of very large firms in the CPS.
To summarize, the firms in the WWW sample look very much like the type of firm that has
been featured in today’s headlines – high pay, generous benefits, and long job durations, at least
as compared to the overall labor market. We do not maintain that this is a totally representative
sample of such firms, but the sample is certainly large and diverse enough to be an informative
“mega-case study” of employment practices in large corporations in the 1990s. As a practical
matter, the type of data examined here is only available directly from the firm and is so highly
sensitive that few firms are likely to be willing to respond to requests from academics for this type
of information. To get a critical mass of data points, collaborative ventures between academics
and compensation experts in the private sector are currently the only way for getting this type of
research done.
Have long-term jobs vanished in the 1990s? Our analysis begins by examining several key
indicators of job stability including average years of tenure, percentage of workers with 10 or
more years of service, percentage of workers with 20 or more years of service, and the firm’s
retention rate. In each case, the data are reported for the entire sample and separately by firm

19
size. Summary statistics on the incidence of long-term jobs in the 1990s are reported in Table 2.
We report unweighted and weighted (by employment in year t-5) averages for the entire sample,
along with weighted averages by size class. The key findings are as follows:

1. The average duration of employee-employer matches in our sample of large firms is longer in
the mid-1990s than in the early 1990s. Average tenure in the early 1990s was 12.6 years and
increased by 0.8 years over the next five years.
2. The increase in tenure was far from uniform across our sample. In 12 firms, average tenure
declined and it was unchanged in one firm. Average tenure increased by two years or more in
11 firms.
3. Average tenure rose across all size categories, except for firms with fewer than 1,500
employees. The increase in average tenure was smallest in the very largest category (where all
three firms underwent significant reductions in force) and the 1,500-to-2,499-employee
category.
4. The percentage of workers who have been with the same employer 10 or more years
increased considerably in the 1990s. On average, 54.5 percent of employees had 10 or more
years of service in the early 1990s; this increased by 4.1 percentage points over the next five
years.
5. The percentage of workers who have been with the same employer 20 or more years also
increased in the 1990s. On average, 25.6 percent of employees had 20 or more years of
service in the early 1990s; this increased by 0.6 percentage points over the next five years.
6. About three-fifths (60.7 percent) of the workers in our sample stayed with the same employer
over the entire five-year sample period.
7. Average age of workers was 40.7 in the early 1990s and increased by 1.2 years over the next
five years. Average age increased by one year or more in every size category.
Retention rates by tenure category The employment records indicate that average tenure and age

21
of employees for these 51 large firms increased in the 1990s. As noted above, this does not mean
job stability has increased. A breakdown of retention rates by tenure category is necessary to
understand whether tenure is rising because everyone is staying or because many junior and
midcareer employees have been laid off. With data on employment by tenure category, we
calculate retention rates by years of service to show the rate at which workers stay with the firm
at different stages of their career.
As shown in Table 3, the five-year retention rate is lowest among employees with 20 or
more years of service, presumably reflecting high retirement rates among these workers.
Retention rates across the entire sample rise with seniority through 15-to-19 years of service, a
pattern that is consistent with the findings of the mobility literature and reflect job shopping, firstin-first-out (FIFO) layoffs, and perhaps up-or-out contracts. Over 70 percent of mid-career
employees (10 to 19 years of service in year t-5) stay with the firm for another five years.
However in the two smallest size categories (less than 1,500 employees and 1,500 to 2,499
employees), retention is greatest among the most junior employees, which most likely reflects
opportunities for advancement created by rapid growth in these firms.

An important issue in terms of job security is how the pattern of retention rates across
years of service compares in growing and shrinking firms. Retention rates should be smaller for
shrinking firms because of greater odds of a layoff or an early-retirement buyout. Quits might
also increase if workers have opportunities elsewhere. If the implicit contract of job security for
midcareer employees has been abrogated in the 1990s, one would expect to see much smaller
retention rates for those with 10 to 19 years of service in shrinking firms than in growing firms.
On the other hand, it is conceivable that shrinking firms have used the standard methods of FIFO
layoffs and early-retirement buyouts to downsize their workforce.
As expected, Table 4 shows a very large difference in weighted retention rates between
growing and downsizing firms – 69 percent of all employees stay for five additional years in
growing firms versus only 59.8 percent in shrinking firms. Despite this overall disparity in
retention rates by employment growth, the retention rates for midcareer employees are virtually
indistinguishable for growing and downsizing firms. This is true for both the weighted and

unweighted tabulations. All of the difference in aggregate retention rates results from lower
retention for the most recent hires and the most senior employees. Job retention is the same for
midcareer employees in downsizing companies as it is in growing companies.
How do retention rates in the large firms in our sample compare to those for the rest of
the labor market? The most straightforward comparison is with the Neumark, Polsky, and
Hansen (1997) finding of an overall retention rate of 54.4 percent for 1991-95. It is not especially
surprising to see that the five-year retention rate for growing firms in the Wyatt sample is
considerably higher. What may be surprising is that the five-year retention rate of 59.8 percent
for the downsizing firms in the Wyatt sample is greater than the four-year retention rate for the
entire labor market. From a purely statistical standpoint, a worker in the early 1990s had higher
odds of staying with a large firm in the Wyatt sample that was going to decrease employment than
they would have had in any job picked at random.
5. Determinants of retention
The data on retention imply that midcareer employees have been sheltered from
downsizing in large firms in the 1990s, contrary to media accounts. A regression analysis allows
us to control for other variables that are correlated with employment growth, especially labor
costs and firm size, and also permits a test of one dimension of the age-substitution hypothesis.
The retention rate was regressed on the following variables: log employment in t-5, the change in
log employment between t-5 and t, log compensation (including health care, defined benefit and
defined contribution pensions, and paid time off), the steepness of the compensation profile (as
measured by the log difference in compensation between those aged 45 to 49 with 20 to 24 years
of tenure and those aged 25 to 29 with zero to four years of tenure), the percentage of workers

24
with less than five years of service in t-5, and the share of workers with 25 or more years of
service in t-5. To determine if the impact of these variables varied with seniority, a separate
model was estimated for five different ranges of the seniority distribution. The results are reported
in Table 5. To obtain a more in-depth view into decision making by workers and firms in the
context of downsizing, separate models were estimated for growing and shrinking firms; these
results are reported in Table 6.
Employment growth: As expected, retention rates increase with employment growth. A
0.1 increase in log employment growth is associated with a 5.6 percentage point increase in the
retention rate. The impact of employment growth on retention is much greater for junior than
senior employees. A 0.1 increase in log employment growth is associated with a 7.8 percentage
point increase in the retention rate of employees with 0 to 4 years of service. In contrast, it is
associated with just a 3.0 percentage point increase in the retention rate of those with 20 or more
years of service. This indicates that seniority continues to be strongly associated with
employment adjustment decisions by firms.
This conclusion becomes more robust when the sample is split by employment growth. In
downsizing firms, the retention rate for workers with less than five years of service is much more
sensitive to employment growth than the retention rate for more senior workers. A 0.1 log
decrease in employment is associated with a 9.1 percentage point drop in the retention of workers
with less than five years of service, whereas it has no effect on retention of workers with 20 or
more years of service. Although this result cannot be compared to patterns in earlier decades, it
has a very clear and important implication for today’s debate about job security: the impact of
employment adjustment is still being borne by the most junior workers.

Employment growth is also associated with higher retention rates in growing firms, but the
impact is greatest at the extremes of the seniority distribution. The result for junior workers
probably reflects the relatively greater internal opportunities for advancement in growing firms.
The result for workers with 20 or more years of service is a bit more surprising, and most likely
reflects the efforts of employers to delay retirement.

Each equation is estimated over a subsample of either 19 growing firms or 32 shrinking firms and
includes a constant, percentage with 0 to 4 years of tenure in t-5, percentage with 25 or more
years of tenure in t-5, and log of employment in t-5 as independent variables.

increase in log compensation is associated with a 1.9 percentage point increase in the retention
rate. Looking at the entire 51 firm sample, the impact of compensation on retention appears to be
greatest for midcareer employees. However, as Table 6 indicates, compensation has much less
impact on retention in shrinking than growing firms. Among growing firms, compensation is
associated with higher retention in all but one tenure category and is greatest among the most
senior employees. In shrinking firms, compensation is uncorrelated with overall retention rates, as
well as retention rates for the least junior (tenure under five) and most senior (tenure 20 or more)

27
employees. In these firms, retention will reflect a mix of quit and layoff decisions, making it a bit
difficult to interpret the findings. The fact that compensation is associated with greater retention
among workers with five to 14 years of service could reflect some degree of “job lock” (no exits
despite uncertain future prospects) or confidence in the value of a long term relationship.
Pay differentials by age and tenure: Across the entire sample of firms, the overall
retention rate is much lower in firms with the largest differentials in pay by age and seniority. A
0.1 increase in this log pay differential is associated with a 2.5 percentage point decrease in
employee retention.
Does this mean that firms are making widespread substitutions of new hires for senior
workers? If this were the case, the age-seniority gap in pay would have a much bigger effect on
the retention of senior employees than on entry-level workers; in an extreme situation it could
even have a positive coefficient for low-tenure employees. This is clearly not the case, as the
results in Table 5 show that the impact of profile steepness on retention is nearly equal for
employees in the 0-4 and 20+ tenure categories. Also, if age-substitution were a driving factor in
today’s downsizing patterns, the age-seniority gap in pay would have an impact on retention when
the sample is restricted to downsizing firms. Instead, Table 6 shows no impact of profile
steepness on retention among downsizing firms.
Other variables: The size of the organization in t-5 had no effect on retention. Although
this runs counter to the prevailing wisdom that mobility should fall with size, keep in mind that all
but one firm in this study had 1,000 or more employees in t-5. It could very well be that size has
little to no effect beyond this threshold. Retention was much lower in firms with the largest
shares of employees with less than five years of service. The firms with the largest shares of new

28
hires in t-5 had much lower retention in that tenure bracket, but not in any other. This is
suggestive of some sort of up-or-out contract in such firms. The share of very senior employees
had no effect on retention rates overall or for any particular group.
6. Conclusions and caveats
One possible reason for the difference between the prevailing wisdom (rising job
instability, especially for midcareer workers in large corporations) and the research literature (job
stability has not changed all that much) is that the latter has not focused on large firms. This is the
first study to use employer data to examine job stability in the 1990s, as well as the first to make
distinctions in job stability by employer size and employment growth. We have learned the
following:
•

Job duration in large corporations continues to be much longer than in the rest of the labor
market. This is true for every measure used in this study.

•

There was a 61 percent probability that a worker in one of the large firms in our sample would
be with the same employer five years later. This is about 7 percentage points higher than the
odds for the entire labor market reported in Neumark, Polsky and Hansen (1997). Even in
large firms with shrinking employment, the odds that a worker would be with the same
employer five years later were higher than the same odds for the labor market as a whole.

•

There is no evidence of a trend toward focusing on midcareer employees in the
implementation of downsizing decisions. To the contrary, retention rates for workers with 10
to 19 years of service are virtually the same in downsizing and growing firms. Retention rates
in downsizing firms tend to be lowest among the most junior and most senior employees, as
predicted by human capital models.

29
•

Retention rates were much higher in firms with growing employment than in firms with
shrinking employment. However, across all downsizing firms, the retention of junior
employees is much more strongly affected by the degree of downsizing than the retention of
senior employees.

•

Firms with the largest pay differentials between younger, junior workers and older, senior
workers have lower overall retention rates. However, a careful examination of how
compensation profiles relate to retention in particular tenure brackets shows no evidence that
such employers are substituting younger for older workers.

Even though employment declined in most of the companies in this study, the picture that
emerges here is that jobs in large corporations in the 1990s continue to be much more stable than
in the rest of the labor market and that this is especially true for midcareer workers.
This picture is consistent with other research by economists on job duration in that we do
not find a sharp downward break during the 1990s. To reconcile our results with the prevailing
wisdom is much more difficult. One possibility is that the firms in this study are not totally
representative of the firms featured in media accounts: large firms with long-term job attachments
and generous pay and benefits packages. Even though we have reported as much information as
we can about these firms and even though some of the firms in our sample have been featured in
media accounts of downsizing, ultimately this issue can only be resolved through further research
that attempts to replicate and extend the findings of this study.
Another concern is that all of our data are for the 1990s, leaving open the question of how
this experience compares to earlier decades. To address this issue, we extracted data for private
sector employees aged 16 or higher from the May 1983 and April 1993 supplements to the

30
Current Population Survey. These supplements were selected because they contained information
on firm size and employee benefits. We estimated probit models of the odds of being in a longterm job (10 plus or 20 plus years of service) and a regression of years of service and used models
that included a wide range of independent variables, including indicators of firm size. We found
that there has been no change between 1983 and 1993 in the differential in length of service
between firms with 1,000 or more employees and smaller firms or in the firm-size differential in
the odds of being in a long-term job. If anything, the coefficients for the 1,000 plus category were
slightly larger in 1993 than in 1983.
One aspect of job stability that this study does not address is the consequences of mergers
and selloffs. According to data compiled by Securities Data Company reported in the Economist
(1998), mergers and acquisitions were at record levels in 1997, with deals worth $957 billion or
12 percent of GDP. This is well above the $138 billion level (two percent of GDP) in 1991.
M&A activity in intervening years ranges between two and eight percent. Although this study
cannot address job instability arising from restructuring, we should emphasize that much of the
policy and media discussion of the issue has focused on firms that have not gone through mergers.
The other way of reconciling our results with the prevailing wisdom is to recognize that
anecdotes are an imperfect substitute for data. We do not question that many individuals,
families, and communities have been shattered by downsizing experiences in the 1990s. What we
question is whether these well-publicized events reflect a widespread shift in the incidence of
long-term jobs in large corporations. We have not found any evidence indicating such a shift so
far.
