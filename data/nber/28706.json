    "abstract": "\n\nHow do agents respond to policy when investments have high upfront costs and lasting payoffs? We estimate farmers\u2019 short- and long-run responses to changes in groundwater pumping costs in California, one of the world\u2019s most valuable agricultural regions, where perennial crops with these investment dynamics are prevalent. We leverage quasi-experimental variation in groundwater costs driven by regulated electricity tariffs to estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of land use with state dependence and forward-looking farmers. Farmers\u2019 short-run elasticity of groundwater demand is \u22120.72, but temporary cost shocks do not induce crop switching. In contrast, their long-run elasticity is \u22120.48, driven by a shift away from unsustainable short-run coping strategies and towards meaningful reductions in water-intensive perennial cropping and increased fallowing. California\u2019s flagship groundwater sustainability targets will require a 47% tax in regulated areas on average, which would lower perennial acreage by 10% and increase fallowing by 18%.\n\n",
