    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops a procedure for uncovering the common cyclical factors that drive a mix of stationary and nonstationary variables. The method does not require knowing which variables are nonstationary or the nature of the nonstationarity. An application to the FRED-MD macroeconomic dataset demonstrates that the approach offers similar benefits to those of traditional principal component analysis with some added advantages.\n\n",
