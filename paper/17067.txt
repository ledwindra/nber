ABSTRACT
This paper uses detailed barcode data on purchase transactions by households in 49 U.S. cities to overcome
a large number of problems that have plagued spatial price index measurement. We identify two important
sources of bias. Heterogeneity bias arises from comparing different goods in different locations, and
variety bias arises from not correcting for the fact that some goods are unavailable in some locations.
Eliminating heterogeneity bias causes 97 percent of the variance in the price level of food products
across cities to disappear relative to a conventional index. Eliminating both biases reverses the common
finding that prices tend to be higher in larger cities. Instead, we find that price level for food products
falls with city size.

Introduction

The variation in prices and price indexes across locations is as central to economic geography and international economics as inflation is to macroeconomics. However, the methods
used to construct prominent spatial price indexes are significantly cruder than those used to
construct inflation rates and other inter-temporal price indexes. For example, while the U.S.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) compares the relative prices over time of identical goods sold in
the same store, regional price indexes compare different (but similar) goods purchased in different stores.1 Moreover, the U.S. CPI accounts for product entry and exit. Evidence suggests
that product availability varies across locations as well as over time, yet even the latest spatial
price indexes do not account for these differences.2
This paper uses detailed barcode data documenting purchase transactions by households
in 49 U.S. cities to overcome these obstacles in spatial price index measurement. In order to
give some sense of the magnitude of the heterogeneity and variety biases in standard indexes
we focus on two phenomena: the spatial variation in price indexes, which is itself the subject
of the purchasing power parity (PPP) debate, and the correlation of price indexes with population, which yields a common agglomerating force across many New Economic Geography
(NEG) models. Our use of better data enables us to replicate prior results from these areas and
demonstrate a number of novel findings.
First, we precisely measure prices of identical goods sold in comparable stores across 49
U.S. cities to properly estimate spatial price differences. While standard price indexes show
a positive correlation between average prices and city sizes, this correlation almost entirely
disappears when we compare transaction prices of identical products purchased in the same
stores. If we define purchasing power parity (PPP) deviations as differences in the average
price of traded goods, we find that 97 percent of the variance in PPP deviations for groceries
across U.S. cities can be attributed to heterogeneity biases in the construction of price indexes.
Second, while average product prices do not vary much across space, we find dramatic
differences in product availability. The detail of our transaction-level data allows us to quantify
these differences. We estimate the number of varieties of products available in each city and find
that a doubling in city size is associated with a 20 percent increase in the number of available
products.
1 The

ACCRA (American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association) index of U.S. urban prices, used
in important papers such as Chevalier (1995), Parsley and Wei (1996), Albouy (2009), and Moretti (2013), is an
example of such an index.
2 The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) recently released regional price (RPP) indexes for the U.S. The RPP
methodology, outlined in Aten (2005) and Aten and Martin (2012), makes some headway towards adjusting for
product and store heterogeneity. Product heterogeneity has also been partially addressed in the latest Penn World
Table (PWT), which compares quality-adjusted prices across countries (Feenstra et al., 2012). Data limitations
mean that neither the PWT or the BEA’s RPP indexes compare identical goods in different markets (which is
critical for the approach used in this paper), nor do they adjust for variety differences.

1

Finally, we use data on the purchase quantities, as well as transaction prices, to demonstrate
that the differences in variety availability yield economically significant variation in the price
level across cities.3 When we use the data to construct a theoretically-rigorous price index that
corrects for product, purchaser, and retailer heterogeneity and accounts for variety differences
across locations, we find that the price level is actually lower in larger cities. Consumers spend
less, on average, to get the same amount of consumption utility in larger cities.
The association between city population and price levels plays an important role in many
urban and NEG models. NEG models typically predict that price indexes over tradable goods
are lower in larger cities (see, e.g., Fujita (1988); Rivera-Batiz (1988); Krugman (1991); Helpman (1998); Ottaviano et al. (2002); Behrens and Robert-Nicoud (2011)). This prediction is
at odds with empirical work demonstrating that prices are higher in larger cities (DuMond et
al., 1999; Tabuchi, 2001). One reason that these studies have not been deemed fatal for the
theory is that it is easy to modify NEG models to generate higher housing prices in cities (see,
e.g., Helpman (1998)). Our paper suggests data problems in the construction of urban price
indexes are sufficiently large to explain the seemingly contradictory evidence: variety- and
heterogeneity-adjusted price indexes are lower in larger cities. If we also extract non-traded
land price components from goods prices to construct a producer price index, we find that the
price of purely traded goods falls even more sharply. This result is consistent with Helpman
(1998) and Suedekum (2006) whose work suggests that, while the price of purely traded goods
should be lower in cities, the inclusion of non-traded goods prices in the index can produce an
inconclusive result.
A key difference between this paper and earlier work is that we work with barcode data,
so the prices we compare are for identical goods. Our dataset includes the prices for hundreds
of thousands of goods purchased by 33,000 households in 49 cities in the U.S. Critically, the
data lets us know the price of each good, where it was purchased, and information about the
purchaser. Consistent with earlier analyses, if we aggregate our data and compare the prices of
categories of goods, we find that the elasticity of the grocery price level with respect to population is 0.042. This implies that a New Yorkers pay 16 percent more for similar, but not necessarily identical, groceries than people in Des Moines (population 456,000). However, when we
adjust this index, step-by-step, for the various biases we identify in the standard methodology,
we end up with our final estimate for the correct elasticity: -0.011. In other words, when they
are estimated properly, grocery price indexes do not rise, but rather fall, with population.
One of the most important classes of bias are “heterogeneity biases,” which arise from not
being careful about which prices are being compared. For example, the price of an item like
a “half-gallon of whole milk” can vary enormously depending on a number of sources of un3 We

use the word “price” to refer to the price of a particular good and the term “price level” to refer to a price
index, or some weighted average of relative prices across goods.

derlying heterogeneity. “Product heterogeneity biases” arise because there are many varieties
of whole milk that differ enormously in price, e.g., name brand vs. store brand, organic vs.
non-organic, etc.4 “Retailer heterogeneity biases” arise because high-amenity stores may systematically charge different prices to low-amenity stores for the same good. Finally, “purchaser
heterogeneity biases” arise because shoppers who search intensely for the lowest price can often purchase the same good in the same store for less. Regional price indexes typically do not
correct for these biases because without barcode data it is difficult to find the same good in
the same store chain in two different locations.5 To get some sense of the magnitude of these
biases among goods that are available in more than one location, we regress dis-aggregate log
prices against log population with product, purchaser characteristic, and store controls. We
find that controlling for these heterogeneity biases reduces the elasticity of price with respect
to population from 0.042 to 0.006 (86 percent). This indicates that the large positive elasticity
in the aggregate data is due to the fact that consumers in large cities tend to purchase higher
quality varieties in nicer stores and shop less intensely (presumably because rich people have a
higher opportunity cost of time). Although statistically different from zero, the elasticity that
remains after controlling for heterogeneity is not economically meaningful; it implies prices of
commonly-available goods are approximately equal in large and small cities. Indeed, between
95-97 percent of the variance in PPP deviations across cities disappears once we correct for
these biases.
A second major source of bias is variety bias. Variety biases arise because consumers do not
have access to the same set of products in all locations. These biases have been studied in the
context of the CPI by Broda and Weinstein (2010), but there is reason to believe that they are
much more important in the regional context. The difference in product availability between
New York and Des Moines, for example, is likely to be much greater than the difference in
product availability in the U.S. economy from one year to the next. In order to quantify this
effect, we adapt some well-developed statistical procedures to the problem of estimating the
number of varieties in cities. Our results indicate very large differences in variety availability.
We estimate that there are approximately four times more types of grocery products available
in New York than in Des Moines.
In order to quantify the variety bias we need to put more structure on the problem. We use
a spatial variant of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) exact price index developed in
the seminal work of Feenstra (1994). The CES structure is commonly employed in NEG models
4 Just

to give one simple case of this, in Westside Market in New York on August 18, 2013, a half gallon of
Farmland whole milk sold for $2.47 while a half gallon of Sky Top Farms whole milk sold for $6.59.
5 The food component of the BEA RPP is based on BLS data. The BLS is careful to keep products and stores
constant over time, but uses random sampling to select the stores and products for which prices are collected in
each location. ACCRA provides field agents with detailed instructions to collect prices for products and in stores
meeting certain specifications. These instructions leave a large scope for product and store heterogeneity in prices.

3

and is well suited for our data.6 When calculated over varieties available in more than one city
and using prices adjusted for product, purchaser, and store heterogeneity, the theoreticallyrigorous CES index yields almost the same elasticity of price with respect to population as the
price regression above. An advantage of the CES framework is that it enables us to make an
additional adjustment for the fact that small cities offer consumers substantially fewer purchase
options. Given the important difference in product availability across locations, we find that
variety bias is extremely important economically. Correcting for the variety bias further lowers
the elasticity to -0.011. In other words, when we correct for heterogeneity and variety biases,
the standard result that prices rise with city size is reversed.
This paper complements large literatures studying international price and variety differences. Simonovska (2010) and Landry (2013), for example, use micro price data to document
international price differences of identical products. Barcode price data has also been used extensively in the study of PPP convergence (see a recent survey by Burstein and Gopinath (2013))
and PPP convergence (see, e.g., Broda et al. (2008); Burstein and Jaimovich (2009); Gopinath
et al. (2011)). Hummels and Klenow (2005) document that larger countries both export more
varieties of products; while Bernard et al. (2007) and Eaton et al. (2011) document that larger
countries import more varieties of products.
There is less work on intranational price and variety differences. Parsley and Wei (1996)
use the ACCRA data to examine convergence to the law of one price in the U.S. Crucini and
Shintani (2008) use similar data from the Economist Intelligence Unit, to examine the persistence of law of one price deviations for nine U.S. cities. This work on deviations from the law
of one price does not address the question of how much of the difference in observed prices
across cities reflects unobserved heterogeneity in products or retailers. The only other paper, to
our knowledge, to compare prices of identical goods within countries is Atkin and Donaldson
(2012), who use spatial price differences as a proxy for intranational trade costs in developing
countries.
A nascent literature has documented that larger and more dense areas in the U.S. have more
varieties of restaurants (Schiff, 2012). Unfortunately, the lack of price data and the inability to
control for quality differences across restaurants in different locations make it difficult to accurately measure the welfare implications of these variety differences. Recent work by Couture
(2013) uses household travel patterns to estimate the substitution between restaurants but, without an additional price or quality measure, he cannot separately identify price from quality so
must assume that these two factors are perfectly correlated.
In complementary work, Handbury (2012) uses the same data as the current paper to cal6 Recent

NEG models have also used the quadratic linear framework developed by Ottaviano et al. (2002).
While quadratic linear framework is tractable for theoretical analysis, it is difficult to estimate and, therefore, not
well-suited for price index measurement.

culate variety-adjusted city-specific price indexes for households at different income levels and
finds that high-income households face relatively lower price indexes in cities with higher per
capita incomes. Consistent with the PPP variance results here, Handbury (2012) finds that these
intra-income differences are driven entirely by variety differences across cities. Both papers
point towards the relevance of the extensive variety margin in explaining PPP deviations across
cities.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sections 3 and 4 explore how identical goods
prices and goods availability vary across cities. In Section 5 we summarize these results using
an urban price index that adjusts for the heterogeneity and variety biases in standard indexes.
Finally, in Section 6, we control for retail rents in order to estimate how producer, or wholesale,
prices vary across cities. Section 7 concludes.

Data

The primary dataset that we use is taken from the Nielsen HomeScan database. These data were
collected by Nielsen from a demographically representative sample of approximately 33,000
households in 52 markets across the U.S. in 2005.7 Households were provided with Universal
Product Code (UPC) scanners to scan in every purchase they made including online purchases
and regardless of whether purchases were made in a store with scanner technology.8 Each
observation in our data represents the purchase of an individual UPC (or barcode) in a particular
store by a particular consumer on a particular day. We have the purchase records for grocery
items, with information on the purchase quantity, pre-tax price, and date; the name or type of
the store where the purchase is made; and demographic information on the household making
the purchase.9
Figure 1 presents the basic structure of our data. A barcode, u, uniquely identifies a product. For example, “Horizon 1% Milk in a Half-Gallon Container” has a different barcode than
“Horizon 2% Milk in a Half-Gallon Container.” Nielsen provides product characteristics for
each barcode, including its brand, a detailed description of the type of good that Nielsen refers
to as a “module,” and a more aggregate description of a good that Nielsen refers to as a product
“group.” For example, “Horizon 1% Milk in a Half-Gallon Container” is sold under the “Hori7 The

cases where panelists shop at stores without scanner technology, they report the price paid manually. Since
errors can be made in this reporting process, we discard any purchase records for which the price paid was greater
than twice or less than half the median price paid for the same UPC, approximately 250,000 out of 16 million
observations.
9 Nielsen provides a store code for each transaction in the data. For all but 800,000 of 16 million transactions,
the store code identifies a unique store name. For the remaining observations representing 4.4 percent of sales in
the data, Nielsen’s store code refers to one of approximately 60 store categories, such as “Fish Market,” “Cheese
Store,” “Drug Store,” etc.

zon” brand in the “Milk” module that fits within the “Dairy” product group. We group barcodes
with the same brand and in the same module into “brand-modules.” For example, “Horizon
Milk,” “Horizon Butter,” and “Breakstone Butter,” constitute three different brand-modules in
the “Dairy” product group, the first of which is in the “Milk” module and the latter two are in
the “Butter” module. The 2005 HomeScan sample we consider contains transaction records for
almost 350,000 UPCs that are categorized into 597 modules, 27,853 brands, and 55,559 brandmodule interactions and 63 product groups.10 Detailed descriptions of the Nielsen data and the
sampling methods used can be found in Broda and Weinstein (2010).

Although the Nielsen dataset contains data for 52 markets, we classify cities at the level
of Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) where available and the Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) otherwise. For example, where Nielsen classifies urban, suburban, and
ex-urban New York separately, we group them all as New York-Northern New Jersey-Long
Island CMSA. We use population, income distribution, and racial and birthplace diversity data
from the 2000 U.S. Census and 2005 retail rents from REIS.11,12 The population and retail rents
for the markets included in the analysis are listed in Table A.1, along with market IDs we will
use to identify markets in the charts below. There are two cases in which Nielsen groups two
MSAs into one market. In these cases, we count the two MSAs as one city, using the sum of
the population and the population-weighted mean retail rents.
10 This

sample excludes the “random weight” product group. The quality of random weight items, such as
fruit, vegetables, and deli meats, varies over time as the produce loses its freshness. We cannot control for this
unobserved quality heterogeneity.
11 Specifically, we use the combined effective rents for community and neighborhood shopping centers. Effective
rents adjust for lease concessions.
12 We replicated the analysis below using total manufacturing output and food manufacturing output as alternative measures of city size and reached the same qualitative conclusions. This is not surprising, as the data for total
manufacturing output and food manufacturing output from the 2007 U.S. Economic Census were highly correlated
with population across the markets in our sample, with coefficients of 0.70 and 0.73, respectively.

Measuring Retail Prices in Cities

While our ultimate goal is to construct the first theoretically-founded urban price index, we
begin by exploring the data. Variation in the price index across cities is driven by differences
in the prices of identical goods and the variety availability. Our reduced-form analysis explores
each of these factors. In this section, we focus only on the price data and then address goods
availability and the construction of an urban price index in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

3.1

Evidence From Categories of Goods

A common method to compare price levels across cities within countries relies on unit value indexes such as those published by the Council for Community and Economic Research (formerly
the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA)). ACCRA collects prices
in different cities across the U.S. for a “purposive” (i.e., non-random) sample of items that selected to represent categories of goods. For each item, ACCRA’s price collectors are instructed
to record the price of a product that meets certain narrow specifications, e.g., “half-gallon whole
milk,” “13-ounce can of Maxwell House, Hills Brothers, or Folgers ground coffee,” “64-ounce
Tropicana or Florida Natural brand fresh orange juice,” etc. ACCRA takes the ratio of the average price collected for each item in each city and quarter relative to its national average in that
quarter. The ACCRA COLI is a weighted average of these ratios, where item weights are based
on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2004 Consumer Expenditure Survey.13
While we will deal with a host of problems arising from comparing prices of similar, as
opposed to identical, products later, our first task is to replicate the standard result that if one
uses the standard ACCRA methodology, the price index for tradable goods rises with population in our data. In order to establish this stylized fact, we obtained the ACCRA COLI data
for 2005 and measured the association between log population and four different indexes: ACCRA’s aggregate, or composite, cost-of-living index; their grocery index; and two food price
indexes that we built using the ACCRA item-level price ratios and weights. We refer to these
two constructed indexes as the ACCRA food index and Nielsen food index. The ACCRA food
index replicates the ACCRA methodology, but only over food items. The Nielsen food index
replicates the ACCRA food index using Nielsen price data. To build this index, we first identified the set of UPCs in the Nielsen data whose characteristics match the ACCRA specifications
for each food item represented in the ACCRA index. We then calculated the average price observed in the Nielsen data for the set of UPCs matching each item in each city and the ratio of
each of these city-specific item unit values to their national average. The Nielsen food index for
each city is the weighted average of these Nielsen unit value ratios across items using ACCRA

We regressed the log of each price index for each city on the log of the city’s population
and report the results in Table 1. As one can see from the table, there is a very strong positive
association between each of these price indexes and population. Although the composite ACCRA index, which includes land prices, rises the steepest with population, we see a very similar
pattern for the grocery and food price indexes. A one log-unit rise in city size is associated with
a four percent increase in the food price index when we build it using Nielsen data and seven
percent when we rely on the ACCRA data. While the magnitude of the slope coefficient varies
across the indexes, none of these differences are statistically significant.14 In particular, all four
indexes, using both the ACCRA and the Nielsen data, imply that there is strong positive association between city size and the price level. These coefficients are economically significant as
well. Even the smallest coefficient, from the Nielsen price index regression, is economically
significant, indicating that a consumer in New York pays 16 percent more for food items than a
person in Des Moines.15

3.2

Controlling for Product, Buyer, and Retailer Heterogeneity

There are three types of heterogeneity biases that may generate the positive correlations observed above: product heterogeneity bias, retailer heterogeneity bias, and purchaser heterogeneity bias. If consumers in larger cities systematically purchase higher quality (i.e., more
expensive) varieties within a product category, then a higher average price level in a city might
14 This

partially reflects the fact that the correlation coefficient between the various price indexes ranges from
0.8 to 0.9.
15 Other indexes show a similar pattern. When we regress the BEA RPP index for goods against log population
using our sample of cities, the coefficient on log population is 0.026 and statistically significant at the 1 percent
level. There are many potential reasons for the difference between this elasticity and those reported in Table 1,
including that the RPP covers a different, broader set of goods than we have in the Nielsen data and partially adjusts
for product and store heterogeneity.

8

just reflect the fact that consumers in that city buy more expensive varieties of that product category. Similarly, retailer heterogeneity bias can arise because consumer in large cities might
purchase goods in stores that offer systematically higher amenities. For example, some grocery
stores, like Whole Foods, offer nicer shopping experiences than mass-merchandisers. Finally,
if there are a higher fraction of wealthy people in large cities, and rich people look for bargains
less than poor people, purchaser heterogeneity might mean that purchase prices may reflect
different shopping intensities of consumers.
As we mentioned earlier, our objective is obtain a standardized price measure that reflects
the prices of identical goods purchased in different locations but at similar stores and by consumers with similar shopping intensities. Essentially, we are trying to do the spatial equivalent
to the time-series methodology employed in the construction of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes for identical products, purchased in the same store, by field
agents with common shopping instructions.
Our methodology for doing this is quite straightforward. Let Pucrh be the average price that
a household h paid for UPC u in store r in city c.16 We refer Pucrh as the “unadjusted price”
and define pucrh as ln(Pucrh ). We can then construct an adjusted price index by running the
following regression:
pucrh = αu + αc + αr + Zh β + εucrh
(1)
where αu , αc , and αr are UPC, city, and store fixed effects, respectively, and Zh denotes a vector
of household characteristics and β are the corresponding coefficients. Household demographic
dummies are included for household size, as well as the gender, age, marital status, and race of
the head of household; in addition, we control for household income, which is correlated with
shopping intensity. Our store fixed effects take a different value for each of the approximately
600 retail chains in our sample that serve at least 2 cities. For stores that we observe serving a
single city, we restrict αr to be the same for all stores of the same type, where type is defined in
one of seven “channel-IDs”: grocery, drug, mass merchandiser, super-center, club, convenience,
and other.17 The αr are designed to capture store amenities, and the Zh β capture factors related
to purchaser heterogeneity.
The city fixed effects, αc , can be thought of as city price indexes that control for the types
of products purchased, the store in which the purchase occurred, and the shopping intensity
16 HomeScan

panelists record purchases for each transaction they make while participating the survey and data
records are identified using a calendar date. We aggregate the data to the annual frequency, summing purchase
values and quantities across transactions in the 2005 sample. The average price paid is, therefore, the sum of
the dollar amounts that a household h paid for UPC u in store r over all of the transactions where we observe
the household purchasing that UPC in that store, divided by the sum of the number of units that the household
purchased across the same set of transactions. We identify the “store” r that a transaction occurs in using Nielsen’s
store code variable.
17 We apply the same restriction to stores whose codes refer to store categories (such as “Fish Market,” “Cheese
Store,” etc.) rather than store names.

of the buyer. We then can test whether standardized urban prices co-vary with population by
regressing the city fixed effects on log population, i.e.,
α̂c = α + γ ln(Popc ) + εc ,

(2)

where ln(Popc ) is the log of population in city c. In this specification, γ tells us how prices vary
with population after we control for the different bundles of products purchased in different
cities. An advantage of this two-stage approach as opposed to simply including co-variates of
interest in equation (1) is that our city price level estimates are not affected by what we think
co-varies with urban prices. Thus, we separate the question of whether urban prices rise with
population from the question of how to correctly measure urban prices. We will use this feature
of the methodology in Section 5. However, as a robustness check, we will also show in Section
3.4.1 that our two-stage approach is not qualitatively important for our results.

3.3

Evidence from Barcode Prices

Recall that in Section 3.1 above, we showed that products from the same category were purchased for higher unit values in larger cities. The results in Table 1 indicated that a one log unit
rise in city size is associated with a four percent rise in the unit value of groceries. We will now
demonstrate that almost all of this effect can be explained by product, retailer, and purchaser
heterogeneity biases. In other words, past studies have found that there are higher traded goods
prices in larger cities because big cities have different (less price sensitive) consumers purchasing different (more expensive) varieties of products in different (more expensive) stores.
Table 2 presents results from estimating equations (1) and (2). The first key difference from
Table 1 is that we are now gauging price differences between identical products, or UPCs, sold
in different cities.18 In the first column of the table, we present the results from a specification
that only adjusts for product heterogeneity. In other words, instead of running the regression
specified in equation (1), we compute the city price index by only regressing prices on UPC
dummies and city dummies. This method for computing the price index corrects for product
heterogeneity, which are contained in the UPC fixed effects, but does not adjust for purchaser
and retailer heterogeneity. In the second panel, we report the results from regressing the estimated city dummy coefficients on log population. We obtain a coefficient of 0.0139, which
is only one third as large as the coefficient we obtained in Table 1 when we used the ACCRA
methodology to generate a price index and regressed that on population. This result indicates
that two-thirds of the positive relationship between prices and city size in the unit value index
reflects the fact that people in larger cities purchase far more high-priced varieties of goods than
18 In all regressions, we weight the data by the transaction value which gives more weight to goods that constitute

higher expenditure shares.

In Column 2 of Table 2, we adjust the urban price index for both product heterogeneity
and purchaser heterogeneity. The positive coefficient on household income indicates that high
income households systematically pay more for the same goods as poorer households. Some of
this may be due to the fact that high-income households have a higher opportunity cost of time
and therefore shop less intensively and also have a greater willingness to shop in high amenity
stores. Alternatively, some of this positive association may be due to the fact that stores that
19 One possible concern with these results is that shifts in the weighting of the data or some other factor associated

with the shift from the price index methodology to the regression methodology is responsible for the drop. We

cater to richer clientele are able to charge higher markups. While we will disentangle these
two forces later, for the time being we simply note that controlling for purchaser heterogeneity
causes the coefficient on log population to fall by another ten percent.
Interestingly, controlling for store fixed effects in Column 3 has a much more substantial
impact on the elasticity of urban prices with respect to population than controlling for purchaser
heterogeneity: more than halving the coefficient. The large impact of controlling for store
heterogeneity implies that a second important reason why prices appear higher in larger cities
is that residents of large cities disproportionately shop in stores that charge high prices in all
cities. The most obvious source of this sort of heterogeneity is differences in amenities—rich
households tend to purchase nicer varieties of goods and shop in nicer stores—but we will also
examine the possibility that markup variations are explaining this in Section 3.4.2. Finally, if
we control for both product, purchaser, and retailer heterogeneity in Column 4 the coefficient
collapses to only 13 percent of its magnitude in Table 1. Most of this fall arises from adjusting
for retailer heterogeneity, which reflects that shoppers in larger cities purchase more items in
high-amenity stores. The coefficient on household income remains positive and significant,
which means that richer households pay more for the same UPC even in the same store. We
interpret this as evidence for the impact of purchaser heterogeneity on prices. Interestingly, the
magnitude of the coefficient on income in Column 4 is about 70 percent as large as in Column
2, indicating that most of the reason why richer households pay more for the same UPC is due
to their lower shopping intensity within stores and not to their choosing to shop in nicer stores.

The hollow circles indicate the price indexes computed using the ACCRA methodology and the
solid circles indicate those computed after correcting for the various forms of heterogeneity in
the data. As one can see from the plot, there is a dramatic collapse in the relationship between
urban prices and population once one controls for product, purchaser, and retailer heterogeneity. Indeed, the slight positive association that we identified in Table 2 is almost imperceptible,
indicating that its economic significance is minor. Moreover, most of the dispersion in city price
indexes disappears once we control for heterogeneity yielding very small deviations from the
fitted line. After adjusting for the various forms of heterogeneity bias, the variance in urban
price levels falls by 95 percent. In other words, purchasing price parity for tradables hardly
varies across US cities.

3.4

Robustness

In this section we consider two robustness checks. First, we demonstrate that our results are
similar when we estimate the association between city population and prices in a one-step estimation procedure. Second, we demonstrate that our results are not due to variable markups.
3.4.1

One-Step Estimation Procedure

Thus far we have been working with a two-step procedure for estimating the association between city population and prices. In Table 3 we repeat our exercise using a one-step procedure
in which we replace the city fixed effects in equation (1) with the log of population in each city.
The results are extremely similar to our earlier ones. The coefficients on log population are, in
particular, very close to their counterparts in Panel B of Table 2, which tells us that our choice
of a two-step procedure does not qualitatively affect the results.
3.4.2

Amenities vs. Mark-ups

One of the important adjustments that we make is for store amenities. Our methodology assumes that if consumers in a given city pay more for identical products when they buy them
at one type of store relative to other stores within the same city, the higher price must reflect
a difference in store amenities. An alternative explanation is that the higher price reflects a
higher markup. If stores that are prevalent in larger cities charge higher markups, our results
might be due to the fact that our method of eliminating retailer heterogeneity would be eliminating markup variation across cities and therefore might be understating the high prices in large
cities. In other words, if the store effects capture amenities, consumers do not necessarily find

big cities to be more expensive because they are getting a higher-quality shopping experience
in return for paying a higher price. If the store effects instead reflect markup differences due
to differences in market power across stores offering the same shopping experience, then consumers are not getting anything in return for the relatively high prices charged by stores in large
cities and will, therefore, perceive these stores as more expensive.
Although we cannot measure markups directly, we can look at store market share information in an attempt to assess how markups might vary in our data, first across cities, and then
across retailers and, in particular, across retailers that locate disproportionately in large, relative to small, cities. In many variable markup demand systems involving strategic substitutes,
markups positively covary with market shares. For example, Feenstra and Weinstein (2010)
show that for the translog system, markups will positively covary with the Herfindahl index
in the market. We can compute retailer Herfindahl indexes for each city by aggregating the
purchases of consumers in each store. Not surprisingly, Herfindahl indexes are negatively correlated with city size (ρ = −0.3) reflecting the fact that consumers in large cities not only have
more choices of products, but also more choices of where to purchase those products. This circumstantial evidence suggests that, if anything, we are understating the amenity effect because
14

stores in large cities are likely to face more competition and charge lower markups (which is
also consistent with models like Melitz and Ottaviano (2008)).
We also can try to strip out the market power effect from our estimates more directly. In
order to do this we control for differences in markups across retail chains, or types, by including
store market shares in the regression where we estimate the store effects (αr ).20 Specifically,
we add the market share of each store in each city to equation (1) and estimate
pucrh = αu + αc + αr + Zh β + γSharerc + εucrh ,

(3)

where Sharerc is store r’s market share in city c and γ is a parameter to be estimated. We
interpret α̂r in this specification as the component of the store’s idiosyncratic price that cannot
be explained by its market power. We then subtract these α̂r estimates from observed prices,
adjusting prices for the component that is potentially related to differences in amenities, but not
the component related to differences in markups via market power. We regress these adjusted
prices against city fixed effects to estimate urban price indexes that control for differences in
amenities across stores, but still allow for price differences resulting from differences in market
power:
pucrh − α̂r = αu + α̃c + Zh β + ε̃ucrh ,
(4)
The dependent variable is the store amenity-adjusted price and α̃c is an urban price index that
reflects systematic differences in prices across stores with different market shares, but not those
related to unobserved heterogeneity between stores.
Table 4 presents the results of this exercise. The estimates for equation (3), in Column 1,
suggest no significant relationship between a store’s market share in a market and the price it
charges.21 The coefficient on market share is positive but not statistically significant, indicating
that the capacity of a retailer to exercise market power is quite limited in most cities.22
Column 2 presents the results of estimating the price indexes according to equation (4), and
Column 3 presents the results of regressing the resulting adjusted city fixed effects, α̃c , against
population. Not surprisingly, given the lack of a significant effect in Column 1, we do not find
that adjusting for market share qualitatively affects our results. The city price indexes that have
20 Recall

that r denotes the store code for each transaction. Most store codes uniquely identify retail chains or
standalone stores; others refer to one of 60 store categories. If a store only has sales in one city or we do not have
the store name, we restrict αr to be equal across stores with the same “channel-ID,” which can take one of seven
values: grocery, drug, mass merchandiser, super-center, club, convenience, and other. We do not group stores in
this manner when calculating market shares: Sharerc represents the sales share of store code r in city c.
21 We also tried non-linear specifications linking store shares with market power by including quadratic and
cubic terms without finding a significant link.
22 This result is consistent with the previous literature on retailer market power in the U.S. grocery sector which
finds that stores do not exploit market power in their pricing decisions. For example, Ellickson and Misra (2008)
demonstrate that “stores in a particular market do not use pricing strategy as a differentiation device but instead
coordinate their actions” and find that “firm size is not the primary determinant of pricing strategy.”

Do Larger Cities Have More Varieties?

Many NEG models predict not only that the price level of tradable goods should be lower, but
also that larger cities should offer consumers more varieties because more firms can enter in
larger markets. This prediction also has implications for the price level in cities as varieties that
are unavailable in locations are effectively priced at their reservation levels. In this sense, we
can think of the variety bias as an extreme form of the well-known substitution bias that plagues
fixed-weight price indexes—if prices are so high that goods are not consumed in small cities,
16

fixed-weight indexes will understate the true cost of living because high-priced goods that are
not consumed will receive a weight of zero in the index. While we will deal with both the
substitution and variety biases in Section 5, in this section we examine the underlying evidence
on variety availability.

4.1

Data Overview

The simplest way to document that consumers in larger cities consume more varieties is to
examine whether we observe more varieties being purchased in larger cities. Figure 3 shows
the relationship between the log number of UPCs observed in the Nielsen sample for each
city against log population. This relationship is upward sloping with a coefficient of 0.312
and standard error of 0.043. We cannot interpret this estimate as the elasticity of variety with
respect to city size, however, because it is affected by sample bias: Nielsen tends to sample
more households in larger cities.

1. Numbers on plots reference the market ID of the city represented, as listed in Table A.1.

One way to deal with this bias is to instead examine whether the number of different varieties consumed by an equal number of households varies with city size. The basic idea is that
any two households are less likely to purchase the same product in markets where there are
more products to choose from. If there is less overlap in the varieties purchased by different
households in larger cities, we expect to see equally-sized samples of households from these
cities purchasing larger numbers of unique varieties.
We therefore restrict ourselves to only looking at 25 cities in which Nielsen sampled at
least 500 households and compare the number of varieties purchased by a random sample of
17

500 households in each of these cities.23 Figure 4 plots the aggregate number of different
UPCs purchased by these randomly-selected households against the size of the city in which
the households live. The results show a clear positive relationship between the variety of UPCs
purchased by 500 households in a city and the population of the city. The slope of the linear
regression fit is 0.033 with a standard error of 0.017. The large amount of noise in the 500household variety counts indicates that this estimate may be subject to attenuation bias.24

Notes:
1. Numbers on plots reference the market ID of the city represented, as listed in Table A.1.

These results are certainly suggestive of the notion that the number of varieties available
23 There

is a trade-off between the number of households that we consider and the number of cities that can be
included in the sample. As we decrease the number of households selected, we increase the number of cities in
our sample (adding small cities disproportionately). However, as we work with smaller samples of households, we
have a lot more noise because the number of barcodes purchased by a small sample of households can vary a lot
depending on the households picked. This results in attenuation bias.
24 We have replicated this analysis looking at the purchases of different fixed numbers of households and, consistent with the attenuation bias hypothesis, we find that the estimated variety-city size relationship is increasing
in the number of households under consideration. For example, the coefficient on city size is statistically zero
when we consider the number of varieties purchased by samples of 116 households in all 49 cities, but increases
to 0.05, statistically significant at the 5 percent level, when we look at the number of varieties purchased by 750
households, in the 23 cities where this is possible.
One reason why it is difficult to identify differences in the number of varieties available in a city in the purchases
of small samples of households is due to the fact that many households purchase “popular” goods that other
households in their city also purchase. To see the intuition here, suppose that all households purchase N + 1
products, N of which are the same across households in a city and one of which is drawn at random from the set of
varieties available in the city. Regardless of how many varieties are available for purchase in a city, we can at most
expect to see N + 1 unique varieties purchased by one household, N + 2 by two households in the same city, N + 3
by three, etc. The number of varieties purchased in a city will range from N to N plus the number of households
sampled in a city.

18

in a location rises with number of inhabitants in that location, but neither provides a reliable
estimate of the elasticity. In the next section, we take a more direct approach to estimating the
variety-city size relationship: we use all of the information at hand to estimate the total number
of varieties available in each location and then examine how these aggregate variety estimates
vary with city size.

4.2

Estimating the Number of Varieties in Cities

The principle challenge that we face in measuring the number of varieties in a city is that our
data is not a census of all varieties purchased in a city but rather a count of varieties based
on a random sample of households. Fortunately, our problem is isomorphic to a well-studied
problem in biostatistics: estimating the number different species in a general area based on
the number of species identified in certain locations (see Mao et al. (2005, 2004)). Prior work
in this area has solved the problem using parametric and structural approaches that yield very
similar results in our data. Since the parametric approach is significantly simpler to explain, we
focus on the parametric approach and relegate the the structural approach to Appendix A as a
robustness check.
In order to obtain some intuition for this methodology, assume that the expected number
of different products purchased by one household in city c is denoted by Sc (1). The expected
number of distinct products purchased in a sample of n households can be denoted by the “accumulation curve,” Sc (n). Accumulation curves must be concave because every time the sample
size rises by one household the probability of finding good that has not been purchased by any
of the other households falls. Moreover, a critical feature of accumulation curves is that as the
number of households surveyed rises, the number of observed varieties in a city must approach
the true total number of varieties in a city. We can write this formally as limn→∞ Sc (n) = ScT ,
where ScT is the total number of distinct varieties available in the city.25 In other words, the
asymptote of the accumulation curve is the estimate for the total number of goods available in
the city.
Estimation of ScT requires us to know the expected value of distinct varieties for each sample
of households, i.e., (Sc (1), Sc (2), Sc (3), . . . ), and also the functional form of Sc (n). Estimating the expected number of distinct varieties purchased by a sample of n households, Sc (n) is
straightforward. The only econometric issue we face is that the number of distinct varieties
we observe being purchased, Sc (n), in a sample of n households is going to depend on exactly
which households are in the sample. For example, our measure of Sc (1), how many different
goods one household purchases, depends on which household is chosen. In order to obtain an
25 This

property is based on the assumption that all types of varieties have a positive probability of being pur-

chased.

19

estimate of the expected number of goods purchased by a sample of n households, Colwell and
Coddington (1994) propose randomizing the sample order I times and generating an accumulation curve for each random ordering indexed by i. The expected value of the number of varieties
purchased by n households can then be set equal to the mean of the accumulation curves over I
different randomizations, i.e.,
1 I
Sc (n) = ∑ Sci (n).
I i=1
We set I = 50.26
Once we have our estimates for each Sc (n), we can turn to estimating the asymptote,
Sc (Hc ) = ScT . Unfortunately, theory does not tell us what the functional for of Sc (n) is, so
we follow Jimenez-Valverde et al. (2006) by estimating the parameters of various plausible
functional forms and use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) goodness-of-fit test to choose
between a range of functional forms that pass through the origin and have a positive asymptote.

4.3

Results

We can get a clear sense of how this methodology works by simply plotting the accumulation
curves. Figure 5 presents a plot of accumulation curves for the twelve cities for which we have
the largest samples. As one can see from the picture, the average sample of 1000 households in
Philadelphia (population 6.2 million) purchased close to 70,000 different varieties of groceries.
By contrast, the average sample of a 1000 households in Saint Louis (population 2.6 million)
purchased closer to 50,000 different varieties. Moreover, these curves reveal that the four highest curves correspond to Philadelphia, D.C.-Baltimore, New York, and Boston, which are all
among the five largest cities in our sample. In other words, this limited sample indicates that a
given number of households tends to purchase a more diverse set of goods when that sample is
drawn from a city with a larger population.
We can examine this more formally by estimating the asymptotes of the accumulation
curves. Since we are not sure how to model the functional forms of these accumulation curves,
we tried five different possible functional forms – Clench, Chapman-Richards, Morgan-MercerFlodin, Negative Exponential, and Weibull. We choose among these based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Weibull was a strong favorite with the lowest AIC score in the
majority of cities for which we modeled UPC count accumulation curves, and so we decided to
focus on this functional form.
Once again, we can get intuition for how this methodology works by showing the fit for a
sub-sample. Figure 6 plots the raw data and the estimated Weibull accumulation curve for our
26 The

resulting estimates are less noisy, and their correlation with city size less subject to attenuation bias, than
the 500-household variety counts studied in Section 4.1 above, each of which is just a single point on a single
accumulation curve for each city.

largest city, New York. A typical sample of 500 random households buys around 49,000 unique
UPCs, and a sample of 1000 households typically purchases around 66,000 different goods. As
one can see from the plot, the estimated Weibull distribution fits the data extremely well. The
estimated asymptote is approximately 112,000 varieties, which is 35,000 more than we observe
in our sample of 1500 New York households.27
Figure 7 presents a plot of the log of the estimated Weibull asymptotes for each city against
the log population in the city. As one can see, there is a clear positive relationship between
the two variables—we estimate that households in larger cities have access to more varieties
than households in smaller ones. It is interesting that the relationship between city size and
the total number of varieties in a city is much stronger than the relationship between city size
and the number of varieties purchased by a fixed sample of cities observed in Figure 4. This
is consistent with the pattern observed in Figure 5: there is less dispersion in the number of
unique UPCs purchased by a common set of household across cities increases as the number of
household in that set increases. Overall, the data support relationship between the size of a city
and the number of varieties available hypothesized by NEG models. Residents of New York

We test this relationship between city size and variety abundance formally in Table 5. Table
5 presents the results from regressing the log estimated number of varieties in a city on the log
22

of the population in the city. The first three columns of the table present regressions of the
log sample counts of varieties in each city on the log of the city’s population. The next three
columns present regressions of the log estimate of number of varieties based on the Weibull
asymptotes on city size. As one can see from comparing columns 1 and 4, the elasticity of
variety with respect to population is slightly less using the Weibull estimate presumably because
the Weibull corrects for the correlation between sample size and population in the Nielsen data.
What is most striking, however, is that we observe a very strong and statistically significant
relationship between the size of the city and the number of estimated varieties. Our estimates
indicate that a city with twice the population as another one typically has 20 percent more
varieties.

One concern with these results is that they might be biased because larger cities have more
diverse populations. In order to control for this we constructed a number of Herfindahl indexes
based on the shares of MSA population with different income, race, and country of birth. These
indexes will be rising in population homogeneity. In addition, we include the per capita income
in each city. As one can see from columns 2 and 5 in Table 5, controlling for urban income and
diversity does not alter the results.
Finally, we were concerned that our results might be due to a spurious correlation between
city population and urban land area. If there are a constant number of unique varieties per unit
area, then more populous cities might appear to have more diversity simply because they occupy more area. To make sure that this force was not driving our results, we include the log of
urban land area in our regressions. The coefficient on land area is not significant in any of the
23

specifications, while the coefficient on population remains positive and very significant. These
results indicate that controlling for land area and demographic characteristics does not qualitatively affect the strong relationship between city size and the number of available varieties. The
R2 of around 0.5 to 0.6 indicates that city size is an important determinant of variety availability.
Thus, the number of tradable goods varies systematically with city size as hypothesized by the
NEG literature.

The Price Level in Cities

5.1

Constructing an Exact Urban Price Index

In order to produce a theoretically-sound price index for a city, we need to take into account not
only the heterogeneity measurement issues discussed in section 3 and the product availability
differences discussed in Section 4 but also make adjustments for substitution biases. Progress
can only be made by putting some more structure on the problem, and so we will assume that
one can use a CES utility function to measure welfare in cities. The CES has the advantage of
not only being tractable and estimatable, but also has been used in many economic geography
models, such as Krugman (1991), so our results can be thought of as a reasonable structural
estimate of what the price level is in this framework. Moreover, Feenstra and Weinstein (2010)
show that this index yields very similar aggregate price levels to the translog (which is a secondorder approximation of an arbitrary expenditure system) even when the number of varieties is
varying. Thus, the CES assumption is unlikely to dramatically affect our results relative to other
commonly used price indexes.28
Feenstra (1994) developed the variety-adjusted price index for the CES utility function.
Here, we will modify it so that it can be used with our data. In the original Feenstra paper,
the price index was expressed in terms of price level in period t as compared to t − 1. Instead
of working with two time periods, we modify the notation of the basic theory so that we can
compare two locations. In particular, we will express the price level in each city as its level
relative to the price level a consumer would face if the buyer faced the average price level in the
U.S. and had access to all the varieties available in the U.S. This approach enables us to write
the price level in every city relative to the the same U.S. national benchmark, which greatly
28 Given

that the median number of UPCs purchased in a module by a single person household (conditional on
purchasing anything in the module) is one, the data suggest that one should think of households as having heterogeneous ideal-type preferences, as opposed to the identical CES preferences that form the theoretical foundation
for the variety-adjusted exact prices indexes used in this paper. This discrepancy, however, is not a problem for
our analysis if we think of consumers as having a logit demand system. In particular, Anderson et al. (1987) have
demonstrated that a CES demand system can arise from the aggregation of ideal-type logit consumers. We will
therefore follow Anderson et al. (1987) and use the CES structure to evaluate aggregate welfare even though we
know that the discrete choice model is a better depiction of reality at the household level.

24

simplifies the analysis.
5.1.1

Intuition

It is worth spending a little time on the intuition behind this index before plunging into the
detail. Feenstra’s basic insight was that a variety-adjusted CES exact price index (EPI) can be
written as a standard CES price index, which we term the “Conventional Exact Price Index”
or CEPI, multiplied by a “Variety Adjustment” or VA term. The CEPI is a sales-weighted
average of the prices of each good sold in the city where the weights adjust for conventional
substitution effects. In our context, one can think of the CEPI in city c, CEPIc , as the correct
way of measuring the price level of the commonly available goods within each product group
in city c relative to their national average price.
Since some goods are not available in each location, we need to adjust the CEPIc by the
variety adjustment VAc . The variety adjustment corrects the price index for the impact of missing varieties on consumer utility. It is based on two factors: the quality-weighted count of the
goods unavailable in a location and the substitutability of these missing goods with other goods
that are available in a location. The quality-weighted count of missing goods weights each good
by how important it is in the utility function. Controlling for price, consumers will care more
about not having access to high-quality varieties more than low-quality ones. In the CES setup,
if two goods of have the same price, their relative market shares will be determined by their
relative qualities. So, if consumers in a city do not have access to a good with a high national
sales share, we know that they are missing a good with greater importance (or price-adjusted
quality) than they would be missing if they could not buy a good with a low market share. As
a result, the national market shares of goods not available in a location properly captures the
quality-adjusted count of the unavailable goods.
The second adjustment comes from knowing the substitutability of the goods. Not having
access to a good without close substitutes is worse than not having access to a goods with close
substitutes. In order to account for this force empirically, we follow Broda and Weinstein (2010)
by allowing consumers to value not having access to an entire brand-module differently than
not having access to a good within a brand-module. For example, if Coke and Pepsi both sell
two soft-drink barcodes under each of their brands (cans and two-liter bottles), it may be worse
for consumers in a location not to have access to any Coke items than to not have access to just
two-liter bottles. In terms of the formulas, this will require us to weight our quality-adjusted
counts of missing products in a location by how similar those products are to products that are
available in that location.

25

5.1.2

Notation

Before actually writing down the price index, we need to set forth some notation to make these
concepts concrete. Our first task is to compute the quality-weighted counts of missing goods
in each city that we can feed into our price index. Let g ∈ {1, ..., G} denote a product “group”,
which we define in the same way as Nielsen to capture broadly similar grocery items. Let Bg
and Ug respectively denote the set of all “brand-modules” and UPCs in a product group g, and
Ub be the set of all UPCs in brand-module b.
Not all UPCs are sold in every city, so we now define the subsets of UPCs that we observe
being purchased. Let vuc denote the value of purchases of UPC u observed in the sample for
city c.29 We define Ubc ≡ {u ∈ Ub |vuc > 0} as the set of all UPCs in brand-module b that have
positive observed sales in city c, and Ugc ≡ {u ∈ Ug |vuc > 0} as the set of all UPCs in product
group g that have positive observed sales in city c. We similarly define Bgc ≡ {b ∈ Bg | ∑u∈b vuc 6=
0} as the set of all brand-modules that have positive sales in city c in product group.
We next need to measure the share of available goods both within brand-modules and within
product groups. The simplest of these to construct is the share of available UPCs within a brandmodule. Let sbc be share of national expenditures on brand-module b on UPCs Ubc that are sold
in city c, i.e.,
∑u∈Ubc ∑c vuc
sbc ≡
.
(5)
∑u∈Ub ∑c vuc
sbc tells us the expenditure share of UPCs within a brand-module that are available in a city
using national weights. The numerator is the total amount spent nationally on all the goods
available in city c on UPCs in brand-module b, while the denominator gives the total spent
on brand-module b nationally. This ratio will be less than one whenever a UPC from brandmodule b is unavailable in city c. Another way to think about this variable is to realize that sbc
is positively related to the number of available UPCs in a city and will be smaller if, holding
fixed the number of unavailable UPCs, varieties with a high market share are unavailable. It
is easiest to see what moves sbc by considering an extreme case. If all varieties had the same
price and quality and therefore the same market share, sbc would equal the share of all varieties
within a brand-module that are available in city c, and sbA would equal sbB only if cities A and
B had the same number of UPCs available in brand-module b. In general, however, two cities
with the same number of UPCs available in brand-module b will have equal values of sbc if their
unavailable varieties have the same aggregate importance in national consumption, or national
expenditure share.
29 The

national average price of a UPC is the total value of purchases of that UPC across all cities in the HomeScan sample divided by the total quantity that these purchases represent. In all of the analysis below, we work with
nationally-representative values and quantities for each UPC, scaling the value and quantity of purchases in each
city by the population in that city divided by the total number of household members represented in the Nielsen
sample for that city (i.e., the sum of the household sizes for the Nieslen sample households).

26

We define a quality-weighted count of the brand-modules available in a location analogously:
∑ ∑vbc
sgc ≡

b∈Bgc c

∑ ∑vbc

, where vbc =

∑

vuc ,

(6)

u∈Ub

b∈Bg c

and sgc is the expenditure share of brand-modules within product group g that are available in
city c. The numerator of sgc is the total amount spent nationally on the product group g brandmodules available in city c, and its denominator is the total spent on product group g nationally.
While sbc tells us about the availability of UPCs within brand-modules, sgc tells us about the
availability of brand-modules themselves.
Finally, it is useful to discuss the price data we use in the index. In our preferred specification, we will work with “adjusted prices” that correct for product, purchaser, and retailer
heterogeneity biases. In the simplest case, where we only control for product heterogeneity
biases, we set the adjusted price, P̃ucrh , equal to the the actual price: P̃ucrh ≡ Pucrh = exp {pucrh }.
However, at other times we may want to correct for product and purchaser heterogeneity biases in the collection
of price
o data that we documented in Section 3. In this case, we will
n
set P̃ucrh ≡ exp pucrh − Zh β̂ , or to correct for product, purchase, and retailer heterogeneity
n
o
biases we will set prices equal to P̃ucrh ≡ exp pucrh − α̂r − Zh β̂ . Similarly, we can write
the adjusted value and quantity of UPC u purchased in city c as ṽuc ≡

∑ ∑ P̃ucrhqucrh and

h∈Hc r∈Rc

quc ≡

∑ ∑ qucrh, respectively, where qucrh is the quantity that household h in city c purchases

h∈Hc r∈Rc

of UPC u in store r.

Definition

We define a variety-adjusted spatial price index is based on Broda and Weinstein (2010)’s extension of the Feenstra (1994) index. This extension is exact to a nested CES utility function
and was developed in order to measure inflation over barcoded products, nested according to
Nielsen categories defined above. We adapt Broda and Weinstein (2010)’s intertemporal price
index to a spatial context, re-writing their Proposition 1 as follows:
Proposition 1. If Bgc 6= 0/ for all g ∈ G, then the exact price index for the price of the set of
goods G in city c relative to the nation as a whole that takes into account the differences in
variety in the two locations is given by,

B, σga is the elasticity of substitution across brand-modules in product group g, and σgw is the
elasticity of substitution among UPCs within a brand-module.
This index has been used extensively in the literature (see Feenstra (2010) for a survey of
its use), so we will only briefly discuss its properties here. The index is exact in the sense that
it answers the question of what is the unit cost of achieving a given utility level in various cities
assuming CES preferences.
We can obtain some intuition for the formula by breaking it up into several components.
The term in the square brackets is the exact price index for each product group, and EPIc is
just a weighted average of these product group price indexes where the Sato-Vartia weights
take into account both the importance of each product group in demand and the ability of consumers to substitute away from expensive product groups. Each product-group price index is
composed of two terms. CEPIgc is the conventional exact price index for product group g. It
is a sales weighted average of the prices of each good sold in the city where the weights adjust
for conventional substitution effects. One can think of CEPIgc as the correct way of measuring
the price level of each product group in city c relative to its national average if no goods were
unavailable in the city.
Since some goods are are not available in each location, we need to adjust the CEPIgc by
a
the variety adjustment VAgc . The variety adjustment is composed of two terms. (sgc )1/(1−σg )
corrects the index for the importance of missing brand-modules. As we argued above, sgc
provides a quality-adjusted count of the missing brand-modules in city c, and the exponent
weights these counts by how substitutable they are. For example, if the Coke soft-drink brand
were not available in a city, its importance for the price index would depend on its quality,
that is how important Coke is nationally (sgc ), and how substitutable Coke is with other soft
drinks (σga ). If Coke is highly substitutable with other brand-modules, then σga will be large,
and not having Coke available will not matter much, but if Coke is a poor substitute for other
soft drinks, σga will be small and the quality-adjusted count, sgc , will matter more. The second
variety adjustment term is a weighted geometric average of variety adjustments for each brandwbc
1−σgw

. Each brand-module variety adjustment, (sbc ) 1−σg ,
module available in city c, ∏b∈Bgc (sbc )
corrects the index for the fact that even if brand-module b is available in a city, not all of the
varieties within that brand-module may be available. Thus, if the two-liter bottle of Coke were
28

not available in a city, the impact on the price index would depend on how important twoliter Coke is (sbc ) and how similar two-liter Coke is to other Coke products (σgw ). We obtain the
elasticities of substitution computed for UPCs within a brand-module and across brand-modules
within a product group from Broda and Weinstein (2010).

5.2

Measuring the Share of Commonly Available Goods

Recall that we do not observe the full set of UPCs available in each city. Just as we estimated the
raw count of UPCs available in each city, we now have to estimate the quality-adjusted counts
(or national expenditure shares) of available brand-modules (sgc ) and UPCs (sbc ). In Section
4.2, we built an accumulation curve corresponding to the raw count of the UPCs represented
in different-sized samples of households for each city. We now use the same method to build
curves corresponding to the national market shares of the different brand-modules and UPCs
represented in a sample. Our estimates of the sgc and sbc are simply the asymptotes of these
shares accumulation curves in each market. If sgc (n) denotes the national expenditure share
of brand-modules within a product group g purchased by n households in city c, our estimate
of sgc (the national market share of the brand-modules that are available in a city within a
product group) is simply the value we expect sgc (n) to take when the number of households
equals the number of households in the city, which we approximate using the asymptote of
the accumulation curve, or limn→∞ sgc (n). We use a similar procedure to estimate the national
market share of the UPCs that are available in a city within each brand-module that is available
in the city, sbc .
Unfortunately, we are unable to estimate a value of sbc for every brand-module b in each
product group g for each city c because household samples are sometimes too small to allow
us to observe more than a few purchases of UPCs within many of the brand-modules available
in a city. Since we do not want to estimate accumulation curves for brand-modules in which
there are very few purchases, we pool the data across brand-modules in each city and estimate
a common sbc within each product group, which we denote sgc . In other words, s̄gc tells tells
us the average national market share of UPCs available in a city within the set available brandmodules in a product group in that city. Since s̄gc does not vary at the brand-module level, this
assumption simplifies the variety adjustment in Proposition 1 to:

Price Level in Cities: Evidence

In this section we will present our variety-adjusted exact prices for each city. First, however, we
illustrate how we estimate the brand-module and UPC share inputs into the variety-adjustment
29

component (sgc and s̄gc ) using the bread product group and show how these quality-adjusted
counts vary across cities of different sizes.
Figures 8 and 9 plot the share accumulation curves for one of the largest product groups
in terms of sales and the number of varieties available nationally (bread and baked goods) and
using data from two cities with very different populations, New York and Des Moines. Figure 8
shows the sgc accumulation curve, which tells us about the availability of brand-modules, while
Figure 9 portrays the same curve for sgc (which tells us about the availability of UPCs within
brand-modules). We estimate sgc and s̄gc for each product group and city as the asymptotes of
a Weibull function fitted to each of these curves. As one can see from the plots, the Weibull fits
the share accumulation curves extremely well.30 By examining the asymptote of the Weibull
distribution in the first panel, we can see that New Yorkers have access to a set of bread brandmodules available that constitute 80 percent of national expenditures on bread. By contrast,
residents of Des Moines, with a population less than a fortieth as large, have access to bread
brand-modules that constitute only 62 percent of national expenditures. In other words, the
quality-adjusted count of brand-module varieties is higher in Des Moines than in New York.
Figure 9 shows that even when brand-modules are available in a city, many of the UPCs that
make up these brand-modules are often not available. For example, consumers in New York and
Des Moines only had access to bread UPCs that accounted for on average 64 and 43 percent
of their brands’ national sales in a given module, respectively. This indicates that knowing that
a firm sells a product in a city does not necessarily mean that all varieties of that product are
available there.
In summary, the bread brand-modules available to New Yorkers account for 18 percent more
of the national bread market than the brand-modules available in Des Moines and, conditional
on a brand being available in their city, the varieties of these brand-modules available to New
Yorkers account for 21 percent more of the national market for each brand-module than the
varieties of these brand-modules available to Des Moines residents.
To demonstrate how these differences in the market shares of UPCs and brand-modules
available in the two cities translate into a discount on the exact price index in New York relative
to Des Moines, we can calculate the variety adjustments for bread in each city from equation (7).
The elasticity of substitution between UPCs within brand-modules in the bread product group
is 17.2, so the UPC variety adjustment for New York is 0.641/(1−17.2) , or 1.028. The acrossbrand-module elasticity of substitution for the bread product group is 9.6, so the brand-module
variety adjustment for New York is 0.801/(1−9.6) , or 1.026. Assuming that that all available
goods are sold at the same price in all locations, our estimates imply that the fact that there are
fewer bread varieties available in New York than nationally means that someone restricted to
30 We

selected the Weibull since the AIC favored it for the raw count accumulation curves. We find that the AIC
favors the Weibull distribution when estimating the share accumulation curves as well.

only consume those varieties available in New York would face a price index that is 5.5 percent
higher than someone with access to all national varieties at average national prices. A similar
calculation shows that the variety adjustment for the bread product group in Des Moines is
equal to 6.9 percent. The variety adjustment for New York relative to Des Moines is equal to
1.055/1.069, or 0.987, implying that if the prices of commonly available varieties are the same
in the two cities, people living in New York face 1.3 percent lower costs for bread because they
have access to more varieties.
Figures 10 and 11 plot the average asymptotes of the share accumulation curves (estimated
using a Weibull distribution) in each city against the log of the population in each city to show
that the results for bread in New York and Des Moines are representative of the sample as
a whole. As one can see from the figure, there is a strong positive relationship between our
estimates for the national market share covered by varieties available in each city and the city’s
population. Nationally, consumers spend 5 percent more on brand-modules and UPCs available
in the largest cities than they do on those brand-modules and UPCs available in the smallest
cities. Once again we see that people in larger cities have access to more varieties and/or more
popular varieties, while those in smaller cities have more limited access.

If we compare the results in Figure 10 with those in Figure 7, we can see the importance
of adjusting the data for the quality of the unavailable varieties. We saw in Section 4 that we
estimated New York to have almost four times as many varieties as Des Moines. However,
many of the brands-modules available in New York but not in Des Moines have extremely
small market shares, implying that consumers do not care that much about them. Moreover,
conditional on a brand-module being available, we can see from Figure 11 that Des Moines is
an outlier in terms of having, on average, more UPCs available within that brand-module than
New York. In general, both the shares of brand-modules available and of UPCs available in
a brand-module, conditional on that brand-module being available, are increasing in city-size,
but less so than the raw counts. Even though both raw and quality-adjusted counts of variety
availability indicate that larger cities have more varieties, the differences in quality-adjusted
counts are much smaller, presumably because the most popular brand-modules and UPCs tend
to be available everywhere.
The asymptotes of the share accumulation curves, in conjunction with our price data and
sales weights, enable us to estimate exact price indexes for each city. Proposition 1 defines the
exact price index in terms of product group-specific conventional exact price indexes (CEPIgc )
33

and variety adjustments (VAgc ). We aggregate across product groups to obtain values for each
of these components for each city. Rearranging terms in the exact price index definition from
Proposition 1, we can see that the exact price index is the product of each of these aggregate
components:
EPIc =

∏ [CEPIgcVAgc]wgc = ∏ [CEPIgc]wgc ∏ [VAgc]wgc = CEPIcVAc.

Table 6 presents our estimates for how the conventional exact price index (CEPIc ), the variety
adjustment (VAc ), and their product, the exact price index (EPIc ), vary across cities. The first
three columns in the table use unadjusted prices to compute the index. As we saw in Table
2, unadjusted prices are higher in larger cities, and these results translate into a common exact
price index that rises with city size. These higher prices, however, are offset by an even stronger
variety adjustment to prices arising from the greater availability of varieties in larger cities,
leading to an exact price index that falls slightly, but not significantly with city size.

Notes:
1. The dependent variables in the above regressions are indices. These indices are calculated using unadjusted prices or prices that have been
adjusted as indicated above, using estimates from the regression in Column [4] of Panel A in Table 2.
2. EPIc = CEPIc VAc which implies that log(EPIc ) = log(CEPIc ) + log(VAc ). Note that the dependent variables in the
above regressions are in levels, not logs, so the coefficients on log population in the CEPIc and VAc regressions do not add to the
coefficient on log population in the EPIc regression.

As we argued in Section 3.3, the unadjusted prices, however, are problematic because they
do not correct for the store in which the goods are purchased or the type of household making the
purchase. We therefore use adjusted prices in the subsequent columns. Our price adjustments
are based on the estimates from Column 4 of Table 2. Adjusting for purchaser heterogeneity
hardly had any impact in Table 2, and it barely affects our point estimates in columns 4-6.
However, adjusting for retailer heterogeneity has a big impact. Columns 7-9 present results
in which we also control for retailer heterogeneity. We still obtain a statistically significant
positive association between city size and the common goods price index, but it is economically
small in size. A person moving from Des Moines to New York City would experience the price

of commonly available groceries rise by 1.5 percent. However, this higher common goods price
index would be more than offset by the fact that many goods are not available in Des Moines
and are therefore effectively priced at their reservation level. The gains due to variety mean that
the theoretically rigorous exact price index indicates that the price level in New York is actually
4.2 percent lower than Des Moines.
We can assess the importance of the heterogeneity and variety availability biases visually
in Figure 12. The plots on the left shows how the common-goods exact price index varies
across cities, and the plots on the right shows how the variety-adjusted exact price index varies.
As we saw in Figure 2, there is virtually no upward relationship between the price index for
commonly available UPCs that adjusts for heterogeneity biases and only a slight upward sloping
35

17

relationship when we do not. Similarly, the negative relationship between city population and
the variety-adjusted exact price index is clearly not driven by any outliers.
Figure 12 also demonstrates how controlling for heterogeneity impacts the variance of the
price level across cities. The common-goods exact price indexes plotted on the top left are
calculated with unadjusted prices. The variance in these price indexes, that control for product
heterogeneity but not purchaser or store effects, is already 87 percent lower than the variance in
our replication of the ACCRA food price index. When we further control for purchaser and store
heterogeneity in the indexes on plotted on the bottom left, the variance falls by an additional
10 percentage points to just 3 percent of the variance in the ACCRA-style index. In sum, the
variance in the price level falls by 97 percent when we move from an ad hoc price index to
a theoretically-justified one that corrects for both heterogeneity and substitution biases. This
drop is almost identical to the 95 percent decline in variance that we observed comparing our
replication of the ACCRA food price index with the city fixed effects estimated in Section 5.3.
The methodological differences between the city fixed effects and the CES indexes, therefore,
play only a small role in the drop in variance. We attribute most of the variance in measured
PPP of commonly-available food products to heterogeneity, rather than substitution biases.31
It is interesting to compare the common-good exact price index, CEPIc , in Table 6, with
the coefficient on the city fixed effects, α̂c , in Table 2. We can think of the city fixed effects
as a price index in the sense that they summarize the relative price levels across locations,
where relative prices are weighted by the transaction value weights used in the regressions.
An important difference between the two is that the Sato-Vartia weights used to calculate the
CEPIc are theoretically justified if one assumes a CES utility function, whereas the transaction
weights used in the estimation of the α̂c ’s do not have a theoretical justification but rather serve
an econometric purpose: to minimize the influence of errors associated with small transactions
on the estimates. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that the associations between these variables
and population are so close; the differences are typically around 0.002. This indicates that our
results regarding the computation of the price level of available goods in a city are robust to a
number of sensible aggregation methods.
Taken together with those in Section 3, these results suggest that conventional price indexes
provide a very misleading picture of what the prices of tradables are in cities and also help to
explain why. In Column 1 of Table 1, we saw that the elasticity of a conventional urban price
index with respect to population was 4.2 percent. However, once we controlled for product
heterogeneity, the fact that the standard urban price indexes don’t compare the same goods,
we see that the elasticity falls to 1.6 percent (Column 1 of Table 2): a loss of two-thirds of its
magnitude. Controlling for purchaser and especially retailer heterogeneity more than halves the
magnitude of this coefficient, taking it down to 0.6 percent. Further using the common exact
31 These

price indexes and their relative variances are listed in Appendix Table (A.2).

36

price index instead of an ad hoc one, which is the principle difference between CEPIc and α̂c ,
reduces the coefficient to 0.4 percent (Column 7 of Table 6), which is less than on tenth of its
initial magnitude. Finally, the exact price index, which differs from the CEPIc by correcting for
the fact that some goods are dropped from CEPIc because they are not available (an extreme
form of substitution bias), flips the sign, suggesting that the elasticity of urban price with respect
to population is -1.1 percent (Column 9 of Table 6): a 5 percentage point differential. Thus, the
standard result that the prices of tradables are higher in cities is due to a series of measurement
issues. If one uses a theoretically-sound approach, the result reverses.

5.4

Robustness

One possible concern about these results is that people who live in large cities might not shop
in all of the neighborhoods within the city’s borders. This might bias our variety adjustment
downwards because we may be counting varieties in, say, suburbs that are irrelevant for people
who live downtown.
An easy solution to this problem is to make use of the fact that the Nielsen data records the
household’s county and the zip codes of the stores in which they purchase each UPC. We first
assume that a household is located in the zip code in the county where its grocery expenditures
are the highest. We then construct the population of the market where households in each zip
code can choose to shop. For a set of households living in the same zip code, we sum the
populations of the zip codes where we observe the set of households purchasing UPCs. This
sum tells us the population of the market that is available to households located in that zip code.
We average these market populations across the zip codes in each city to yield the average
population of the neighborhoods where households in the city choose to shop. We refer to this
number as the relevant population.
Table 7 presents results in which we replace the city’s population with the relevant population in the neighborhoods in which households actually shop. The results are, if anything,
stronger than the results using urban population as the measure of city size. The fact that the
results are so similar indicates that understanding where households shop within cities is not
important for understanding the relationship between city size and prices. The key finding is
that the exact price index falls with city size, and this relationship is significant whenever we
adjust prices to take into account store amenities and buyer characteristics.

Producer Prices in Cities

Thus, far we have been focused on consumer prices. However, given that we did not find
much variation in retail markups (which is consistent with our CES structure), we push the

data and strip prices of retailing costs to estimate how producer prices vary across cities. This
is an interesting exercise because many economic geography models (e.g., Helpman (1998))
postulate that the price index for tradables should be lower in larger cities, and the price of land
offsets this price. In these models, it might be the case that producer prices are lower in larger
cities, even when consumer prices indexes, which include land costs, are not.32 Land costs
may drive a similar wedge between retail and wholesale prices in our data. Our retail prices
undoubtedly contain a non-traded land component reflecting the rent paid by the stores selling
the goods. The fact that we observe PPP in these retail prices does not rule out the possibility
that producer prices are lower in bigger cities. While our results provide the correct elasticity
between consumer prices and the size of a city, to the extent that rents are higher in larger
cities, they likely understate the relationship between the prices of traded goods and city size.
Although it is not appropriate for welfare analysis, it is worth considering what happens to the
traded component of goods prices as city size varies.
If we assume that all prices contain a non-traded rental component that rises in proportion to
the rent, we can examine how the tradable component of the price index moves with population
by controlling for a city’s commercial real estate rental cost in the price regressions. This effect
is easiest to see in comparing Panels A and B of Table 8. Panel A replicates the price-city size
regressions across the 45 cities for which we have retail rent data. These results are almost
identical to the estimates over the full sample: each of the coefficients and their associated
standard errors are identical to their corresponding values in Panel B in Table 2 up to one
significant figure. In Panel B, we include retail rents as an explanatory variable and estimate
32 In

Helpman (1998), producer prices of identical tradable goods are lower, on average, in larger cities because
more goods are produced in high population areas and these goods can be consumed locally without paying transport costs. There could, however, be other mechanisms driving our results here. We leave distinguishing between
these explanations to future work.

where ln (Rentc ) is the log of commercial real estate rents in city c and greek letters are parameters to be estimated. The results indicate a very strong positive relationship between retail
rents and urban price levels as is evidenced by the large positive and significant coefficient on
log retail rents and the dramatic jump in R2 . Once again, the coefficient on population now becomes negative (although not significantly so), indicating a weak negative association between
city size and the prices of traded goods. Interestingly, the coefficient on retail rent is quite small
in most specifications, which suggests that the elasticity of goods prices with respect to retail
rents is less than 10 percent. This helps explain why the deviations from PPP are so small in
figures 2 and 12.33
We also can adjust our price index regressions in Table 6 for this force. In Panel B of Table
9, we regress each element of our exact price index on both log population and log rent. As one
might expect, controlling for land rents has a big impact on the common-good exact price index
but has almost no impact on the variety-adjustment, which has no clear theoretical tie to land
prices. Overall, this suggests that the price index for the tradable component of goods prices
falls about 50 percent faster than the overall index.
Although there is a weak positive relationship between city size and retail prices after controlling for product, purchaser, and retailer heterogeneity (but not product availability), these
results suggest that this positive association is entirely due to the fact that retail prices incorporate non-traded goods prices, which vary across cities: if we focused on wholesale prices alone,
we would expect to see, if anything, a negative association with city size.

Conclusion

In this paper we have shown how the lack of sophistication of standard spatial price indexes can
lead to very misleading portraits of how prices vary across space. We find that most of the large
dispersion in food prices across space can be attributed problems in the measurement of these
prices. 97 percent of the variation in price levels across space in these indexes can be attributed
to unobserved heterogeneity in the goods being compared. In particular, product and retailer
heterogeneity play very large roles. We also show that standard indexes suffer severely from the
spatial equivalent of the “new goods bias” that is well known in inflation measurement. Small
cities offer consumers a much smaller array of available goods. Building a price index that
33 This

result is robust across all of our specifications from Section 3. We have replicated the results in Tables
3 and 4 over the sample of cities with retail rents data and find almost no change in the coefficients and their
statistical significance. In all cases, adding retail rents to these regressions flips the sign on the coefficient on
population (although the point estimate is no-longer significant).

takes all of these biases into account, we reverse the conventional finding that tradable goods
prices rise with city size. The elasticity of tradable goods prices with respect to city population
is -0.11.
These results have important implications for a broad class of New Economic Geography
models in which agglomeration is driven, at least in part, by pecuniary externalities. In Krugman
(1991)’s model of monopolistic competition, these externalities arise when there are positive
trade costs between locations: locally-produced goods are cheaper in the local market than they
are elsewhere and larger cities produce more varieties than smaller ones, so consumers in these
locations have access to more locally-produced goods and therefore face a lower price index.
More recent papers propose that other mechanisms are at play here. Behrens and RobertNicoud (2011) and Combes et al. (2012) demonstrate that, with quadratic linear preferences
and fixed trade costs as in Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), three related phenomena yield lower
prices in larger cities: (i) more efficient firms are more likely to locate in, or “select into,”

Notes:
1. The dependent variables in the above regressions are indices. These indices are calculated using unadjusted prices or prices that have been
adjusted as indicated above, using estimates from the regression in Column [4] of Panel A in Table 2.
2. EPIc = CEPIc VAc which implies that log(EPIc ) = log(CEPIc ) + log(VAc ). Since the dependent variables in the
above regressions are in levels, not logs, the coefficients on log population in the CEPIc and VAc regressions do not add to the
coefficient on log population in the EPIc regression.

larger cities; (ii) firms in larger cities can take advantage of agglomeration economies in those
locations; and finally, (iii) larger cities are more competitive so firms charge lower markups
in these locations. Finally, Hummels et al. (2009) argue that scale economies in the shipping
industry lower costs and increase competition on routes to large markets. Similar economies in
domestic transportation could also lower prices in large cities.
While separating the contributions of each of these forces to understanding the spatial distribution of prices is beyond the scope of this paper, our results indicate that the New Economic
Geography framework is correct to predict that the price level of tradable goods tend to be lower
in larger cities.

Structural Variety Estimation

In Section 4, we used a non-structural “accumulation curve” methodology to estimate the number of UPCs available in each city. Here we demonstrate that a structural methodology yields
very similar results for how the number of varieties varies across cities.

A.1

Methodology

We first consider a simple case in which all UPCs are purchased by households with the same
probability in order to develop the intuition, and then move to a more realistic case in which
each UPC has its own purchase probability.
In order to work out the math in the simple case assume that each household selects only one
UPC out of the S UPCs available in the market. If we also assume that each UPC is purchased
with a probability π that is identical for all UPCs in the market, then it follows that π = 1/S.
Our task is to estimate S using the number of different UPCs purchased by a sample of H
households. To do this, we make one additional assumption: stores have sufficient inventories
of goods so that the purchase of a UPC by one household does not reduce the probability of
another household buying the same UPC. If household purchases are independent in the crosssection, then the probability that we observe one of the H households in our sample selecting
a particular UPC is equal to one minus the probability that none of the H households selects
the UPC, or 1 − (1 − 1/S)H . The number of different UPCs that we expect to observe in the
purchase records of the H households is simply the sum of these probabilities across all of the
S available UPCs,
S(H) = S[1 − (1 − 1/S)H ]
(A.1)
It is immediately apparent that equation (A.1) is an accumulation curve that has been derived
from a particular set of assumptions. It would be straightforward to obtain an estimate for the
number of varieties in the market in this simple case. By equating S(H) to the sample UPC
count, S̃(H), we can derive an estimate for the number of available UPCs that satisfies equation
(A.1). Note that the accumulation curve, S(H) should follow the negative exponential function
(which a special case of one of the functional forms we considered in Section 4:


S(H) = S 1 − e− ln((1−1/S)H)

(A.2)

This simple approach cannot be applied to the data for two reasons. First, households purchase more than one UPC in the course of a year. And second, some UPCs, like milk, are likely
to be purchased at higher frequencies than other UPCs, like salt. Hence the probability that we
observe the purchase of a UPC will vary across UPCs. We can deal with the first problem by

48

allowing the purchase probability, π, to differ from 1/S. The second problem, however, is more
complicated because solving it requires us to know the purchase frequencies not only of every
observed UPC but also of the UPCs that we do not observe in our sample. In order to solve this
problem, we follow Mao et al. (2005).
We allow for different products to have different purchase probabilities, but we restrict these
probabilities to be identical for groups of UPCs that we will refer to as “incidence groups.”
This is not that restrictive an assumption as we do not put a limit on the number of incidence
groups but only assume that some UPCs from each incidence group are purchased in our data.
Grouping UPCs into this way enables us to estimate the purchase frequencies for all of the
UPCs in an incidence group even though we may only observe a fraction of the UPCs in the
group being purchased. To put this concretely, suppose that each UPC u has a probability of
πcu of being selected by a household in city c, and that there are K different incidence groups,
or values that πcu can take in each city c, such that πcu = πck for each UPC in incidence group
k. We define αck as the proportion of UPCs in incidence group k in city c, i.e., the proportion of
UPCs that are selected with probability πck in city c. For example, when residents of a particular
city choose to purchase a good, the probability that they will purchase any given UPC can take
one of K values. The incidence groups do not map directly into the product groups or product
modules. The estimated purchase frequency associated with each UPC within a product group
or brand-module will vary with the popularity of the UPC, which may be correlated with its
brand, container, size, and other characteristics. The UPCs in the high frequency incidence
group tend to be the most popular varieties of products that are frequently purchased, e.g. 12packs of some soda varieties, which are purchased by almost a third of the households in our
sample. Less popular varieties of soda tend to fall into the lower purchase frequency incidence
groups, along with the UPCs in less frequently purchased product categories, e.g., cake yeast.
Suppose that there are Sc UPCs available in city c. If we again assume that household
purchases are independent in the cross-section, we can express the probability that any of the
UPCs in incidence group k available in city c is purchased by one of Hc households as one minus
the probability that none of the Hc households selects the UPC, or 1 − (1 − πck )Hc . Taking the
weighted average of these probabilities across incidence groups (using incidence group shares
as weights), we can now express the unconditional probability that any one UPC available in
city c is observed in the purchases of a sample of Hc households without knowing its incidence
K

group as

∑ αck (1 − (1 − πck )Hc ). The number of different UPCs that we expect to observe in
k=1

the purchase records of Hc households in city c is the sum of these probabilities across all of the
Sc available UPCs, or
K

Sc (Hc ) = Sc ∑ αck (1 − (1 − πck )Hc ).
k=1

49

(A.3)

Mao et al. (2004) note that equation (A.3) can be re-written as:
K

Sc (Hc ) = Sc ∑ αck (1 − exp(Cck Hc )) where Cck = − ln(1 − πck )
k=1

Equation (A.3) is therefore referred to as the “generalized negative exponential” (GNE) model.
It is straightforward to see that equation (A.2) is a specific case of equation (A.3) in which the
selection probability is identical for all UPCs, i.e., K = 1 and π = 1/S. Moreover, if we knew
the share of all goods in each incidence group, αck , and the probability that each UPC was
purchased, πck , (A.3) would just give us the equation of a particular accumulation curve for a
city.
Fortunately, we can use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate Sc as well as the αck
and πck for any choice of K. The number of households purchasing product u in city c, hcu ,
follows a binomial distribution where the probability of observing hcu purchases is given by:
Hc
hcu

P(hcu ) = ϕ(hcu ; πcu ) =

!
(πcu )hcu (1 − πcu )(Hc −hcu )

(A.4)

where Hc is the total number of households in the sample for city c,
Hc
Hcu

!
≡

Hc !
hcu !(Hc − hcu )!

and once again πcu = πci for each UPC, u, in category k. Let {hcu }u∈Uc be the observed counts
of each UPC purchased by our sample of households in a city c, where Uc is the set of UPCs
observed in the city c sample. Now, we can define the binomial mixture distribution as follows:
K

Φ (hcu ) =

∑ αck ϕ(hcu; πck )
k=1

This distribution tells us the unconditional probability of observing hcu purchases of any UPC u
in our data, regardless of its incidence group, given the size and purchase probabilities of each
of the incidence groups.
Mao et al. (2005) derive a maximum likelihood methodology for estimating the α’s and π’s
for a given K using data on the number of samples (in our case, households) in which each
variety is observed. The variable nc j is defined to be the number of products that are purchased
by j households in the dataset for city c, i.e., for which hcu equals j. In other words, if 100
UPCs are purchased by no households, 50 UPCs are purchased by 1 household, and 25 UPCs
are purchased by 2 households, then we would have nc0 = 100; nc1 = 50; and nc2 = 25. The

the mixture distribution is

distribution,
Therefore, we only need to estimate the parameters of the mixture
distribution to derive an estimate for the number of available products. To do so, we will maximize a conditional likelihood function. Let ϕ̃(hcu ; πcu ) be a zero-truncated binomial density,
i.e., the probability that a product is purchased by j households conditional on it being purK

chased by more than one household, and Φ̃ ( j) = ∑ αck ϕ̃ ( j; πck ) be the mixture distribution
k=1

over these densities for K incidence groups. If we denote the total number of UPCs that are
purchased by at least one household in the sample nc+ , the conditional likelihood function is

Equation (A.5) gives us the likelihood function as a function of the number of incidence
groups, K. In order to identify the correct number of these groups, we estimate the parameters
of mixture distributions for a range of values for K using the conditional likelihood function.
Each distribution implies a different estimate for the total number of UPCs available in a city.
We then compute the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for each value of K in each city. We
choose between the distributions by selecting the number of incidence groups for all cities equal
to the K that maximizes the sum of the AICs across all cities. The intuition for this procedure is
that each additional incidence group improves the fit but adds parameters, and the AIC provides
a way of determining how many groups are likely to exist in the data.34
Once we have our estimates for the α’s and π’s, we can use equation (A.3) to obtain an
34 We

also assume that the sampling is sufficient so that we observe some UPCs purchased in each incidence
group. We need this assumption because we cannot say anything about the number of goods in an incidence group
that are purchased with such low a probability that no one in the sample ever buys them. In other words, we can
only discuss the number of available varieties for observable classes of goods.

where variables with circumflexes represent parameter estimates and S̃c (Hc ) is equal to the

sampled households in the city, Hc approaches infinity, the fact that the α’s sum to one implies
that our count of the number of distinct products purchased by these households becomes our
estimate of the number of varieties.

Results

With 49 cities, the GNE approach involves the estimation of several hundred parameters, so we
do not report all the values here. The AIC indicates that UPCs tend to fall within 10 incidence
groups in terms of their purchase frequency. Table A.3 summarizes these estimates across our
sample of 49 cities. We see that in all cities there are few UPCs that are purchased with very
high frequency – on average, one in ten thousand UPCs are purchased with a frequency of 0.5
by a household. This would correspond to about 8 UPCs in the typical city having a purchase
probability of 0.5 over the course of a year by a typical household. However, we also see that
the vast majority of UPCs have extremely low purchase probability. 49 percent of UPCs have a
purchase probability of approximately 1 in a thousand. Thus, the product space is characterized
by a few UPCs with high purchase probabilities and a vast number of UPCs that are rarely
purchased.

Another way of summarizing the estimates is to examine how the probability that a UPC
52

is purchased varies with city size. We would expect that the probability that any consumer
purchases any one UPC would go down as the range of available UPCs in the city increases.
Fortunately, this is easy to examine given that our GNE structure enables us to estimate the
average probability that a household in city c purchases a UPC by simply calculating
K

Πc =

∑ α̂c,k π̂c,k .
k=1

In Figure A.1, we see that the estimated average probability of purchase (which uses no population data in its estimation) decreases sharply with city size. A UPC sold in our smallest city,
Des Moines, has three times the probability of being purchased by any individual household as a
UPC sold in New York. The fact that households in larger cities are much less likely to buy any
individual UPC is strongly suggestive of the fact that that the parametric estimate of the UPCs
available in a city is increasing with city size. We test this directly by using the GNE parameter

estimates to calculate an estimate for total number of varieties in each city and considering how
this varies with city size. Figure A.2a plots how the log estimated number of varieties in each
city varies with city size. Visual inspection reveals that the relative relationship between the
estimated number of varieties and city size using the Weibull and plotted in Figure A.2b is almost identical to that obtained with the GNE. We can see this even more clearly in Figure A.2c
where we plot the Weibull asymptotes against the GNE asymptotes. The correlation between
53

the two is 0.99 and the slope is 1.07 indicating that both methodologies yield essentially the
same relationship between city size and the number of available varieties.
The results in Table A.4 confirm this. The first three columns repeat the regression results
reported in columns 4 through 6 of Table 5. The last three columns repeat these regressions
with the log GNE asymptote instead of the log Weibull asymptote as the dependent variable.
The coefficients on log population are almost identical in all three specifications.

How much do Index Formulas Matter?

One concern about comparing the ACCRA fixed-weight methodology with that of the CES
exact price index is that there are a host of differences that are difficult to formalize. Two
of these differences seem to be potentially important. First, the ACCRA index uses purposive
sampling (i.e. choosing the most commonly purchased variety) while CEPI is constructed using
the full sample of goods. Second the ACCRA index is a fixed-weight index, but the CEPI adjusts
for substitution bias by using Sato-Vartia weights.
In Table A.5, we show that neither of these differences are quantitatively important for
understanding our results. The first column of Table A.5 replicates the ACCRA methodology
using the Nielsen data, as we did in the first column of Table 1, but now using the full set of 49
cities instead of the 47 cities for which the ACCRA data was available. Not surprisingly, the
coefficient in the first column of of Table A.5 almost exactly matches that in the first column
of the earlier table. The second column of Table A.5 maintains the same sample of products
used in Column 1 but now recomputes each city’s price index weighting relative category unit
values with Sato-Vartia weights, rather than ACCRA’s fixed weights; essentially using the CEPI
formula to compare category prices, rather than identical UPC prices. The fact that the elasticity
of prices with respect to population hardly changes means that simply moving to the correct
weighting is not an important factor in understanding why the ACCRA price index overstates
the relationship between prices and city size.
The importance of product heterogeneity can be easily seen by comparing Columns 2 and
3. In Column 3, we continue to use the Sato-Vartia weights for each good category but instead
of comparing the unit value paid for all UPCs in a category (e.g., half gallons of whole milk) we
compare the prices of a single UPC within that category across cities. This procedure eliminates
the influence played by product heterogeneity in computing the price index, but enables us to
continue to see the role played by the ACCRA sampling method. The large drop in the elasticity
as we move from Column 2 to Column 3 mirrors the large drop that we saw as we moved from
the first column of Table 1 to the first columns of Table 2 and Table 6, which proves that it is
product heterogeneity that accounts for the big drop in the association between price and city
size.
Columns 4-6 are drawn from Columns 1, 7, and 9 of Table 6. We include them again for
heuristic reasons. In particular, we can see that moving whether we use the ACCRA purposive
sample of UPCs (which yields the results in Column 3) or the full sample of UPCs to Column 4 hardly affects the results. However, as we saw earlier, adjusting for the other forms of
heterogeneity bias and the variety bias ultimately flips the sign of the coefficient.
