The October 1987 stock market crash was unusual in many ways relative to prior history. In particular, stock volatility jumped dramatically during and after the crash, but it returned to lower. more normal levels quickly. I use data on implied volatilities from call option prices and estimates of volatility from futures contracts on stock indexes to confirm this result.\n\n",
