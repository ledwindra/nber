Are Central Banks' Projections Meaningful?
Jordi Galí
NBER Working Paper No. 16384
September 2010
JEL No. E37,E58
ABSTRACT
Central banks' projections–i.e. forecasts conditional on a given interest rate path–are often criticized
on the grounds that their underlying policy assumptions are inconsistent with the existence of a unique
equilibrium in many forward-looking models. Here I describe three alternative approaches to constructing
projections that are not subject to the above criticism, using two different versions of New Keynesian
model as reference frameworks. Most importantly, I show how the three approaches generate different
projections for inflation and output, even though they imply an identical path for the interest rate. The
latter result calls into question the meaning and usefulness of such projections.

Introduction

The periodic construction and publication of macroeconomic forecasts is a
common activity among central banks in advanced industrialized economies.
Those forecasts get considerable attention from analysts, market participants
and the …nancial press. Among the central banks that have adopted an explicit in‡ation-forecast targeting strategy those forecasts play a central role
in the internal decision process for, in many cases, policy settings are chosen
in order to attain a certain in‡ation target at a speci…ed horizon. Those forecasts are also viewed as an important element in central banks’communication policy. More generally, and using the words of the ECB, "macroeconomic
projections play an important role as a tool for aggregating and organizing
existing information on current and future economic developments" (ECB
(2001)).
The methods and assumptions behind those forecasts vary considerably
across central banks. In particular, practices di¤er regarding the assumption
on the path for the short-term nominal interest rate (henceforth, the interest
rate) underlying those forecasts. The relative merits of alternative assumptions on which to condition the published forecasts remains the subject of
considerable debate, partly sparked by the recent decision by some central
banks to change their practice in that regard.1
At the risk of oversimpli…cation, one can distinguish three alternative assumptions underlying central banks’forecasting practices. In some cases the
interest rate is assumed to remain constant at its current level over the forecasting horizon, giving rise to so-called constant interest rate (CIR) forecasts.
Other central banks construct their forecasts under the assumption that the
interest rate will follow a path consistent with current market expectations,
with the latter being approximated with the forward rates implicit in the
yield curve prevailing at the time the projection is made.2 We refer to those
as market expectations (ME) forecasts. A third practice found among central
banks consists in constructing forecasts based on the assumption that the interest rate will follow whatever path the central bank expects it to follow, i.e.
a path consistent with the central bank’s "own policy rule," independently of
whether the latter had been made explicit or not. We refer to those forecasts
1

See, e.g. the recent announcements by the Riksbank (2007) and the Federal Reserve
Board (2007).

Of course, it is not easy in practice to disentangle expected rates from liquidity and
term premia, but this complication is orthogonal to the point made in the present paper.

as central bank’s expectations (CBE) forecasts.3 Since the latter forecasts are
based on the central bank’s best assessment of what the interest rate path
will be, they can be interpreted as unconditional forecasts. By contrast, CIR
or ME forecasts are conditioned on a path of interest rates that does not
generally coincide with the central bank’s own expectations on that path.
As a result, those forecasts are not necessarily the best predictors of future
outcomes, as is implicitly re‡ected in their common labeling as "conditional
forecasts" or "projections". For convenience, in the remainder of the paper
(as well as in the title) I use the term "projections" to refer to forecasts
conditional on a given interest rate path.
Each of the forecasting procedures has its own advantages and disadvantages, which may explain the observed diversity of practices.4 That diversity
is illustrated in Table 1, which summarizes the assumptions on the interest
rate path underlying the forecast practices of seventeen major central banks.
The present paper’s starting motivation is a concern frequently voiced regarding central banks’projections: the inconsistency of their underlying assumptions with the existence of a unique equilibrium in a variety of forwardlooking models, including the new vintage of optimizing models commonly
used for monetary policy analysis.5 That argument hinges on the notion
that, in order to construct such projections, the path of the interest rate is
taken as given by the central bank, i.e. it is assumed that the interest rate
will vary according to a pre-speci…ed path, independently of how in‡ation or
other endogenous variables may end up evolving. In other words, the model
is fed with an exogenous interest rate path as a description of monetary policy, which is known to generate an indeterminate equilibrium (and, hence,
indeterminate forecasts) in many dynamic models with forward-looking components.6
Here I seek to contribute to that debate by clarifying the sense in which
macroeconomic projections conditional on a given interest rate path are or
are not feasible or well de…ned. First, I show that it is indeed possible to overcome the curse of indeterminacy and to generate determinate macroeconomic
projections consistent with an arbitrary path for the interest rate. This is
3

Many central banks that publish CBE-type forecasts for in‡ation and output also
report the associated forecasts for the interest rate path (e.g. the RB of New Zealand,
Norway’s Norges Bank and Sweden’s Riksbank). Others do not (the U.S. Federal Reserve).

done using a canonical version of the New Keynesian (NK) model as a reference framework. As many as three approaches are proposed to construct the
desired projections. The …rst approach, based on the "modest interventions"
model of Leeper and Zha (2003), consists of adding unexpected policy shocks
to the central bank’s rule in order to generate the desired interest rate path.7
The second and third approaches rely on two alternative interest rate rules
designed to generate the desired path of the interest rate as an endogenous
equilibrium outcome, while responding systematically to in‡ation and other
macro variables in a way that guarantees the determinacy of the equilibrium
(and, hence, uniqueness of the projections).
Thus, by showing how projections can be constructed using any of the
above methods, the paper refutes the claim that such forecasts are not feasible due to the indeterminacy underlying the associated equilibrium. The
latter …nding, however, can hardly provide any consolation to advocates of
conditional projections: I show by means of a simple example that the three
methods will generally yield di¤erent projections for variables other than the
interest rate itself, despite the fact that, by construction, the latter exhibits
an identical path across methods. Thus, the problem is not necessarily one
of multiplicity of equilibria resulting from an exogenous interest rate path,
but one of multiplicity of rules that are consistent with the latter path, each
having its own implications for other variables. That observation calls into
question the usefulness of projections conditional on a given interest rate
path since, in principle, there is no obvious reason to prefer one method over
another in order to generate the same path.
That problem does not arise when constructing CBE forecasts, which are
based on the rule e¤ectively followed by the central bank when constructing
those forecasts. More generally, the problem disappears whenever the projections are conditional on a rule (as long as the latter is consistent with a
unique equilibrium), and not on an interest rate path (which may be supported by a multiplicity of rules). It is in that sense that the present paper
provides an additional argument against the reporting of central banks’projections conditional on a given interest rate path, while endorsing instead
rule-based projections. But once this is accepted, it is not clear why the central bank would want to base its projections on a rule other than the actual
rule it follows for, among other things, in that case the projections would

As shown below, the "modest interventions" approach is equivalent to assuming a
switch to the usual interest rate rule right after the forecast horizon

also correspond to the best unconditional forecasts.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the reference model used in the subsequent analysis. Section 3 revisits the
problem of indeterminacy when the interest rate follows an exogenous path,
and shows how this indeterminacy is inherited by the associated projections.
Section 4 describes three approaches that overcome that indeterminacy problem. Section 5 illustrates, using a calibrated version of the reference model,
how those three approaches lead to signi…cantly di¤erent in‡ation and output
projections conditional on an unchanged interest rate, at any …nite horizon.
Section 6 concludes.

A Baseline Model

I use a simple version of the New Keynesian model as a reference framework
for the analysis of alternative macro projections.8 The non-policy block of
the model is made up of the following two equations:
yt = Et fyt+1 g
t

= Et f

1

(it

t+1 g

Et f

t+1 g)

+ yt + ut

(1)
(2)

where yt denotes the output gap, it is the short-term nominal interest rate,
pt pt 1 is the rate of in‡ation between t 1 and t (with pt denoting the
t
log of the price level), and ut .is an exogenous cost-push shock which follows
an AR(1) process with autoregressive coe¢ cient u 2 (0; 1]: All variables are
expressed in deviations from steady state values. Equation (1) can be obtained by log-linearizing the representative household’s Euler equation and
a market clearing condition that equates consumption to output.9 Equation (2) is a version of the so-called New Keynesian Phillips curve, which
can be derived by aggregating the price-setting decisions of monopolistically
competitive …rms subject to Calvo-type constraints on the frequency of price
adjustment, combined with standard assumptions on technology and labor
8

This is the model used in the optimal policy analysis of Clarida, Galí and Gertler
(1999). The reader is referred to King and Wolman (1996), Woodford (2003) or Galí
(2008a) for a detailed description of that model and a derivation of (1) and (2).

We implicitly assume a constant natural rate of interest, and ignore constant terms,
to lighten the notation. The analysis below carries over, with suitable modi…cations, to
the case of a time-varying natural rate of interest.

markets. In that context, parameter corresponds to the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion, is the household’s discount factor and is a coe¢ cient
which is inversely related to the degree of price rigidities. All variables are
expressed in terms of deviations from their values in a zero in‡ation steady
state.
A block describing how monetary policy is conducted completes the model.
We assume that the central bank follows a simple interest rate rule of the
form
it = t
(3)
where > 1. As is well known, the latter condition guarantees uniqueness
of the equilibrium.10
The remainder of the paper examines three alternative approaches to
constructing forecasts for in‡ation and output in the above economy, under
a (counterfactual) assumption regarding how interest rates evolve over the
forecast horizon. But before turning to that analysis I take a brief detour to
describe the basic concern associated with the construction of macroeconomic
forecasts conditional on an arbitrary, exogenously given interest rate path.

Projections Conditional on an Exogenous
Interest Rate Path: The Indeterminacy Problem

For the sake of concreteness, let us assume that at the central bank is interested in the k-period ahead forecasts of in‡ation and the output gap conditional on an arbitrary, exogenous path for the interest rate, fit g. As mentioned above, both the CIR and ME projections constructed and published
by many central banks can be viewed as particular examples of such an exercise since, in both cases, the path of the interest rate is given to the forecaster,
with no room allowed for possible adjustments in response to developments
in the economy, at least over the horizon for which the interest rate path is
de…ned.
10

As discussed in Svensson and Woodford (2005), if the central bank were to follow
instead a "targeting rule," an additional complication would arise as a result of the need
to determine the interest rate rule that would be consistent with the central bak’s desired
allocation but with no other (i.e. the one implying a determinate equilibrium).

5

Combining the assumed interest rate path with equations (1) and (2)
yields the system of di¤erence equations:
t

yt

Et f t+1 g
Et fyt+1 g

= A0

+ B0

ut
it

(4)

where
A0

;

Letting xt = [ t ; yt ]0 and zt
[ut ; it ]0 we can rewrite the previous dynamical system in a more compact way as:
xt = A0 Et fxt+1 g + B0 zt

(5)

Iterating forward on (5) we obtain the following expression for k-horizon
projections as of time t:
Et fxt+k g = A0 k (xt

(6)

ft )

where ft B0 zt + A0 B0 Et fzt+1 g + ::: + Ak0 1 B0 Et fzt+k 1 g. Thus, in order
for the projections at any k horizon to be well de…ned, the current values of xt (and, thus, of in‡ation and the output gap) must be determined
uniquely, which in turn requires that the solution to (5) exist and be unique.
A necessary and su¢ cient condition for that to be the case is that the two
eigenvalues of A0 lie within the unit circle, given that xt consists of two nonpredetermined variables. 11 But as is well known, and formally re-stated
in the following lemma, that condition is not satis…ed under the exogenous
interest rate path regime assumed here.12

The multiplicity of non-explosive solutions to (5) associated with the
exogenous interest rate path implies that the equilibrium value for xt is not

that remain in a neighborhood of the zero in‡ation steady state.

uniquely determined. In other words there exist a continuum of values for xt
that are consistent with a rational expectations equilibrium. It follows from
(6), that there is also a continuum of k-horizon projections for the output gap
and in‡ation, Et fyt+k g and Et f t+k g, consistent with the assumed interest
rate path.
Next I describe three alternative approaches that allow one to construct
in‡ation and output gap projections that are not subject to "the curse of
indeterminacy" described above. A feature common to the three approaches
is their reliance on some rule that turns the interest rate into an endogenous
variable, while guaranteeing that the desired interest rate path fit g is realized
in equilibrium. In all cases it is assumed that the interest rate along that path
converges to its value consistent with a zero in‡ation steady state, at least in
expectation. Given that variables are expressed in terms of deviations from
steady state, this implies that limj!1 Et fit+j g = 0.

Macroeconomic Projections without the Curse
of Indeterminacy

4.1

Interest Rate Rule I

The …rst approach proposed in order to generate unique, well de…ned projections assumes that the central bank adopts the interest rate rule
it =

t

+ vt

(7)

where > 1 and vt is perceived to be an exogenous, zero mean i.i.d. monetary policy shock. Notice that the latter shock is appended to the "usual"
rule (3), in order to captures the deviations ("modest interventions," using
Leeper and Zha’s terminology) required in order to keep the nominal interest
rate on the desired path fit g.13
It is easy to check that there exists a unique stationary solution to the
system made up of (1), (2), and (7), given the assumption of an in‡ation
coe¢ cient greater than one.14 The form of that solution can be guessed to

the i:i:d: assumption ex-post, thus violating the rationality of expectations.
This should be recognized by agents if the "intervention" were to last long
enough.15
The second and third methods described below are not subject to the
previous shortcoming, being fully consistent with the assumption of rational
expectations. Before we turn to them I take a brief detour to describe an
equivalence result.
4.1.1

Modest Interventions vs. Switching Rules: An Equivalence
Result

If the interest rate path on which projections must be conditioned is assumed
to revert back after the forecast horizon to a level determined by the usual
rule, the problem of indeterminacy can be shown to go away, allowing the
central bank to construct well de…ned conditional projections.
To see this assume that the central bank sets the interest rate according
to the rule
it+j = it+j
for j = 0; 1; 2; :::; k and
it+j =
15

t+j

This is acknowledged by Leeper and Zha (2003) who argue that the deviations from
the rule should be small enough not to induce a change in agents’expectations about the
regime in place.

9

for j = k + 1; k + 2; :::., i.e. it sets the interest rate at the level determined
by the given exogenous path up to the desired forecast horizon, and switches
to its regular interest rate rule after that.16 Such an approach is used by
Laséen, Lindé and Svensson (2008), as a way to simulate arbitrary timevarying interest rate rules in the context of the Riksbank’s estimated DSGE
model (Ramses).
Note that from time t + k + 1 onward the equilibrium dynamics are described by (1), (2), and (3), which are associated with a unique equilibrium.
We can solve for that equilibrium using the method of undetermined coe¢ cients, after guessing that both the output gap and in‡ation will be proportional to the cost-push shock. This yields the following expressions
yt+k+1 = aut+k+1

;

t+k+1

= but+k+1

where a and b are given by the same expressions as above.
Combining the previous result with (1), (2) and the fact that it+k = it+k ,
we can write the equilibrium conditions corresponding to period t + k as
yt+k = Et fyt+k+1 g +
=

t+k

(

it+k

)

u ut+k

it+k

which are expressions identical to (8) and (9) above. The corresponding
projections as of time t are thus uniquely determined and correspond to
those generated by the "modest interventions" method.17
16

In that sense, the switching rule approach is more restrictive than the modest interventions approach (or the second and third approaches described below), since it cannot
generate …nite horizon projections conditional on an arbitrary in…nite horizon interest rate
path.
17
One should note, however, that the previous equivalence result hinges critically on
Et fyt+k+1 g and Et f t+k+1 g corresponding in both cases to the expected value conditional
on the baseline rule, and hence on being history-independent. The previous observation
suggests that the equivalence result presented here is unlikely to carry over to a more
general setting with endogenous state variables.

Note that the system (13) involves one predetermined and two nonpredetermined variables. Thus, it has a unique non-explosive solution if
and only if two eigenvalues of A1 lie inside, and one outside, the unit circle.
The following proposition establishes a necessary and su¢ cient condition for
that property to obtain.
18

The present rule generalizes the one considered in Galí (2003, 2008b) to the case of
an arbitrary interest rate path.

11

Proposition 1. A necessary and su¢ cient condition for (13) to have a
unique non-explosive solution is given by > 1
Proof. see appendix.
More generally, one can show that an interest rate rule of the form
it =

t

+ ' yt + vt

generates a unique equilibrium, where > 1 andfvt g is an arbitrary exogenous process. By setting '
and vt = it
it 1 we guarantee that such
a unique equilibrium is associated with the desired interest rate path fit g:

Letting xt = [ t ; yt ; yt 1 ]0 and zt
[ut ; it
projections Et f t+k g and Et fyt+k g using
Et fxt+k g = A1 k (xt

where gt B1 zt + A1 B1 Et fzt+1 g + ::: + Ak1 1 B1 Et fzt+k 1 g, and where xt is
the unique solution to (13), which can be obtained using standard formulae
(see, e.g. Blanchard and Kahn (1980)).
It should be noted here that the role of parameter
is restricted to
guaranteeing that the target path for the interest rate is attained, which is
the case for any value of larger than one. The particular choice of has
no in‡uence, however, on the resulting equilibrium path of in‡ation and the
output gap and, hence, on the corresponding projections. To see this, note
that under rule (10) the linear combination t + yt will be equal to it 1 , for
all t. The latter condition can in turn be combined with in‡ation equation
(2) to obtain a di¤erence equation for the output gap, which can be solved
independently of .

where rt

whose only stationary solution is it = it for all t given our assumption that

The equilibrium dynamics under rule (14) are described by three equations: in‡ation equation (2), the dynamic IS equation (1) and the interest
rate rule (14), with the latter two rewritten in terms of the real interest rate,
that is,

Multiple Determinate Projections: An Illustration using the Basic New Keynesian
Model

The previous section has described three alternative approaches to the construction of projections conditional on a given path for the nominal interest
rate which are not subject to the problem of indeterminacy. Such a multiplicity of approaches raises a natural question: Are the in‡ation and output
gap projections generated by the di¤erent approaches identical, if they are
conditioned on the same interest rate path? The answer to that question is
negative, as the exercises shown next make clear. Furthermore, and most
importantly, the di¤erences across projections obtained using di¤erent rules
are quantitatively large.
For the purposes of the present section I assume that the economy is
described by the basic New Keynesian model used above. In the next section I illustrate the same point using the estimated DSGE model of Smets
and Wouters (2007), a more realistic framework and, hence, one for which
quantitative predictions can be taken more seriously.
Let us consider the case of a central bank which, as of time t, wants to
produce conditional forecasts of in‡ation and the output gap for period t + k.
As above, the non-policy block of the economy is described by equations (1)
and (2). For simplicity, we assume that the economy was at its steady state
position in period t 1, i.e. yt 1 = t 1 = it 1 = 0. A cost-push shock of
unit size is assumed to hit the economy in period t, vanishing over time in
proportion to ku , for k = 1; 2; 3; :::
What are the model-based projections for in‡ation and the output gap
in period t + k conditional on the central bank keeping the interest rate
unchanged? Next I compute those projections under each of the three approaches discussed above for a calibrated version of the baseline model. For
the purposes of this exercise, I assume the following parameter values, which
are similar to those often used in the literature: = 0:99, = 1, = 0:1,
14

= 1:5 and u = 0:5.19 I normalize the size of the shock so that the response
of (annualized) in‡ation on impact under the true rule is of one percentage
point. It should be clear that the main …nding of this section is a qualitative
one, and does not hinge on the details of the calibration.
Figures 1 and 2 display the in‡ation and output gap projections at horizons up to 12 quarters associated with the three rules described in the previous section. The …gures also display the (unconditional) forecast associated
with the "true" rule (3). Note that, even though the three rules support
an unchanged interest rate through the forecast horizon (and beyond, in the
case of rules II and III), their associated projections for in‡ation and output are very di¤erent. The di¤erences among them involve both the size
of the projected changes in in‡ation and the output gap as a result of the
assumed cost-push shock, but also in the patterns of those responses and, in
one case, even the sign of those responses. We also see that none of them
tracks the unconditional forecast well, but this was to be expected since the
latter implies a di¤erent interest rate path. Interestingly, the constant interest rate projections di¤er even in terms of the sign of their deviation from
the unconditional forecasts.
Why do the three rules considered above generate di¤erent projections
despite being associated with an identical nominal interest rate path? Put
simply, the intuition behind that result is that any given nominal interest rate
path is consistent with di¤erent paths of the real rate and expected in‡ation.
In the New Keynesian model, the presence of sticky prices makes it possible
for the central bank to in‡uence real variables, including the real interest
rate. The three rules considered achieve the same nominal rate path through
di¤erent combinations of real rates and expected in‡ation. Not surprisingly,
each of those combinations is associated with di¤erent paths for the output
gap and, as a result, for in‡ation as well. This leads, in turn, to di¤erent
projections.20
19
As argued above, the speci…c choice of has no in‡uence on the projections, as long
as it is larger than one, which we assume here.
20
In the case of ME-based projections, one might argue that there should be a preference
for the rule that does a better job at matching private sector expectations of other macro
variables, in addition to the nominal interest rate. But, any model-based private sector
forecasts would have to be conditioned on some interest rate rule. A well de…ned approach
would thus consist in computing projections conditional on the policy rule assumed by the
private sector. But then it is not clear that those forecasts should be attached much value
if the latter rule di¤ers from the true one.

15

The previous …nding clearly calls into question the usefulness of projections conditional on a given interest rate path, since there is no obvious reason
to prefer one method over another in order to generate the same path. Put
di¤erently, the information required in order to compute well de…ned macroeconomic projections goes beyond the speci…cation of the interest rate path
and the horizon of the projections. A complete description would need to
include the nature and speci…cation of the policy rule that will be followed
in order to support the desired interest rate path.

Multiple Determinate Projections: An Illustration using the Smets-Wouters Model

Next I conduct an exercise similar to the one described in the previous section but using a more realistic version of the New Keynesian model, namely,
the estimated DSGE model of Smets and Wouters (2007). Relative to the
basic New Keynesian model above, the Smets-Wouters model incorporates
a number of features, including endogenous capital accumulation (subject
to adjustment costs), habit formation in consumption, variable capital utilization, staggered wage and price setting with partial indexation, and as
many as seven di¤erent structural shocks. That model, as well as the related
models in Smets and Wouters (2003) and Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans
(2005), can be viewed as the backbone of the estimated DSGE models developed at central banks in recent years and used for monetary policy analysis
and forecasting. The reader is referred to the original Smets and Wouters
(2007) paper (and its companion technical appendix) for details.
The construction of in‡ation and output projections under alternative
rules using the Smets-Wouters model requires two main changes relative to
the analysis above. First, and given the presence of endogenous state variables, the exogenous monetary policy shocks fvt g that must be fed into rule
I ("modest interventions") in order to keep the nominal interest rate along
the desired path (a constant one, in the present exercise) must be computed
using an iterative procedure, as described in the appendix. Secondly, rule
II has to be modi…ed in a way consistent with the speci…cation of the Euler
equation in the Smets-Wouters model, which is given by
xt = Et fxt+1 g

1
(it

(18)

where xt (1
)ct
ct 1
nt , with ct and nt denoting, respectively, (log)
consumption and (log) hours, and where and are themselves functions of
exogenous parameters. Note that (18) di¤ers from (1) due to three factors:
(i) consumption and output no longer coincide due to the presence of capital
accumulation, (ii) habit formation is allowed for (
0, e
), and (iii)
the utility function is (potentially) nonseparable in consumption and hours
(
0). Accordingly, the interest rate rule corresponding to (10), and which
combined with (18) will support an arbitrary exogenous interest rate path
fit g is now given by:
it = it

+ (

+ e xt )

(19)

Finally, I note that rule III des not require any modi…cation and can be
implemented "as is" in the Smets-Wouters model.
Figures 3 through 6 display the in‡ation and output projections over a
twelve-quarter horizon implied by rules I through III under the assumption of
a constant interest rate path (it+j = 0, j = 0; 1; 2; :::), and in response to four
di¤erent structural shocks: a neutral technology shock ("productivity"), an
investment-speci…c technology shock ("investment"), a price markup shock,
and a wage markup shock. These four shocks account for the bulk of the
forecast error variance decomposition of in‡ation and output at a ten-quarter
horizon in Smets and Wouters (2007). In each case, the in‡ation and output forecasts consistent with the "true" interest rate rule are also displayed,
though now the latter rule corresponds to the estimated interest rate rule in
Smets and Wouters (2007), which is substantially richer than (3) above.21
Again, the size of each shock is normalized so that the response of (annualized) in‡ation on impact under the true rule is of one percentage point. For
the purposes of the present exercise the model is calibrated according to the
baseline calibration/estimation in Smets and Wouters (2007).
The projections based on the Smets-Wouters model reported in Figures
3 through 6 con…rm the main …nding obtained in the context of the basic
New Keynesian model, as discussed in the previous section: even though
the three rules considered support the same path for the nominal interest
rate (a ‡at path in this case), their implied projections for both in‡ation and
output are generally very di¤erent, with the gaps among them being economically signi…cant and often of a size of one-hundred or more basis points. Of
21
In particular, the nominal interest rate is allowed to respond, in addition to in‡ation,
to its own lag, as well as the level and …rst-di¤erence of the output gap.

17

course, those projections also display important di¤erences relative to those
generated by the actual rule, though this should come as no surprise since
the latter implies a di¤erent path for the nominal interest rate. As can be
seen in Figure 5, Rules I and II, when conditioned on price markup shocks,
possibly provide the only example of quantitatively similar –though far from
identical–projections (which in turn happen to be similar to those generated
by the actual rule). Yet, even in that case, Rule III involves very di¤erent
projections, with no reason to prefer of discard the latter relative to those
implied by Rules I and II, as argued above.

Concluding Remarks

There appears to be a growing tendency among central banks to construct
and report macroeconomic projections consistent with their own views about
the future evolution of nominal interest rates. Many economists have welcome that development on di¤erent grounds, including its likely bene…ts from
the viewpoint of transparency and ease of communication of the monetary
authority’s decisions and overall strategy to the public.
In the present paper I have provided an additional argument for the adoption of projections based on the central bank’s own interest rate forecasts. I
have done so by arguing that the alternative, i.e. conditioning projections on
an exogenously given interest rate path, rests on shaky theoretical grounds.
The latter assessment does not follow from the often heard argument that
such projections will typically be indeterminate in forward-looking models.
On the contrary, I have described as many as three di¤erent approaches to
construct determinate projections conditional on an arbitrary interest rate
path. Instead, I have argued that the main shortcoming of those projections
lies precisely in the multiplicity of methods (each associated with a di¤erent
rule) that are available to generate them, together with the fact that the different methods generally yield divergent projections for variables other than
the interest rate itself. That observation calls into question the usefulness of
projections conditional on a given interest rate path since, in principle, there
is no obvious reason to prefer one method over another in order to generate
that path.
