    "abstract": "\n\nUsing meta-analysis we find that, on average, sought-after schools do not improve student test scores. A potential explanation for this result is that parents value schools that improve outcomes not well-measured by test scores. We explore this notion using both administrative and survey data from Barbados. Using a regression discontinuity design, preferred schools have better peers but do not improve short-run test scores. Consistent with the proposed explanation, the same students at the same schools have more post-secondary school completion and improved adult well-being (based on an index of educational attainment, occupational rank, earnings, and health). These long-run benefits are larger for females who also experience reduced teen motherhood. Mechanisms are explored.\n\n",

We would like to thank Aubrey Browne and Trevor David from the Barbados Statistical Service as well as Juan Mu\u00f1oz and Ramiro Flores Cruz from Sistemas Integrales Ltd. for allowing us to introduce the necessary questions in the 2016 Survey of Living Conditions to match it with the administrative records. Francisco Pardo, Camilo Pecha, Tatiana Zarate, and Roy Mu\u00f1oz provided excellent research assistance.
