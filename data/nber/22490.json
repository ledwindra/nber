    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a new theory of price rigidity based on \ufb01rms\u2019 Knightian uncertainty about their competitive environment. This uncertainty has two key implications. First, \ufb01rms learn about the shape of their demand function from past observations of quantities sold. This learning gives rise to kinks in the expected pro\ufb01t function at previously observed prices, making those prices both sticky and more likely to reoccur. Second, uncertainty about the relationship between aggregate and industry-level in\ufb02ation generates nominal rigidity. We prove the main insights analytically and quantify the e\ufb00ects of our mechanism. Our estimated quantitative model is consistent with a wide range of micro-level pricing facts that are typically challenging to match jointly. It also implies signi\ufb01cantly more persistent monetary non-neutrality than in standard models, allowing it to generate large real e\ufb00ects from nominal shocks.\n\n",
