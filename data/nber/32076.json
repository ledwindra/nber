    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper aims to identify the sources of human capital growth for the observation period 1990-2020 by region, gender and various determinants. It is a preliminary version of a forthcoming  Inclusive Wealth Report 2023 (UNESCO and Urban Institute of Kyushu University) report. It focuses on five important aggregates by gender: Asia, Africa, Latin America, G20, and the European Union to highlight differences. Human capital per capita does vary significantly across countries in each aggregate. Education and human capital is unevenly distributed among males and females, although both total and per capita human capital have grown over time in almost all countries. Attention must be paid to what has happened to the world's gender-disaggregated levels of education and human capital per capita over time. The future sustainability of nations and the well-being of individuals within nations depend on the continuation of historical progress.\n\n",
