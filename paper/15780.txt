Terms of Trade Shocks and Fiscal Cycles
Graciela L. Kaminsky
NBER Working Paper No. 15780
February 2010
JEL No. E3,E62,F41
ABSTRACT
The latest boom in commodity prices fueled concerns about fiscal policies in commodity-exporting
countries, with many claiming that it triggered loose fiscal policy and left no funds for a rainy day.
This paper examines the links between fiscal policy and terms-of-trade fluctuations using a sample
of 74 countries, both developed and developing. It finds evidence that booms in the terms of trade
do not necessarily lead to larger government surpluses in developing countries, particularly in emerging
markets and especially during capital flow bonanzas. This is not the case in OECD countries, where
fiscal policy is of an acyclical nature.

I. Introduction
After several years of relatively stable commodity prices, volatility has returned, fueling
as always worries about its effects on overall economic stability around the world. This time
around, the debate is also focused on fiscal policy. During the boom that started in 2003,
concerns were raised that commodity price increases were encouraging excessive government
spending in resource-abundant countries, leaving no funds for a rainy day. For example, the
Inter-American Development Bank 2007 Annual Report is entitled All that Glitters May Not Be
Gold, partly in reference to the fiscal positions of Latin American countries during the latest
boom in commodity prices. This report concludes that the fiscal surpluses observed during this
period are far from reassuring since they are based on inflated and unsustainable fiscal revenues
due to transitory increases in the price of commodities. In fact, the report concludes that when
government revenues are estimated at the ‘long-run’ prices of commodities, the average fiscal
position of these countries has deteriorated with deficits averaging 4 percent of GDP.
This concern is not limited to Latin America. Both in academic and policy circles the
debate regarding what governments in commodity producer countries should do when their terms
of trade improve has intensified. A new proposal based on neo-classical models of fiscal policy
supports the creation of Commodity Sovereign Wealth funds. According to this proposal, fiscal
policy should be acyclical, with government consumption smoothed over the business cycle and
savings accumulating in boom times to provide funding for a rainy day. In fact, this policy has
been at the core of the IMF recommendations for countries dependent on commodity exports.1
This paper does not examine the role of these funds but rather pays particular attention to the
effects of terms of trade cycles on fiscal positions around the world.
Relying on data for 74 countries for the period 1960-2008, this paper examines the
evidence on the cycles in the terms of trade and those of fiscal policy. In particular, it studies the
behavior of government expenditure, revenues, and primary balances, as well as inflation. The
paper examines separately the evidence on countries grouped by income levels. It also
disaggregates the sample along a variety of dimensions, by (i) differentiating episodes of capital
flow bonanzas from those when international capital flows are at their historical lows, (ii)
differentiating episodes of terms of trade booms from those of terms of trade crashes, (iii)

separating the responses of countries with persistent terms of trade shocks from those with
transitory terms of trade shocks, (iv) comparing responses during periods of more rigid exchange
rate regimes separately from more flexible arrangements, and (v) examining separately the fiscal
responses in commodity-exporting countries.
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section briefly discusses the theoretical literature
on fiscal policy used to interpret the results on terms of trade and fiscal policy cycles. Section III
provides a visual representation of alternative fiscal policies and terms of trade cycles around the
world by focusing on the evidence of just two countries: Argentina and Norway. Section IV
extends the analysis of fiscal responses to the whole sample of 74 countries using panel data
estimation techniques. Section V contains concluding remarks.
II. Models of Fiscal Policy
A number of models have been proposed to explain the cyclical behavior of fiscal
policies. Keynesian models provide the rationale for countercyclical fiscal policy.

In these

models, the fiscal authority has an objective function that penalizes deviations of output from
trend. Since an increase in government spending and/or a reduction in tax rates expands output
(and vice versa), fiscal policy will be countercyclical. In contrast, neoclassical models rationalize
acyclical fiscal policy since roughly constant tax rates over the business cycle reduce distortions
(see Chari and Kehoe, 1999). Moreover, if government spending is endogeneized (by, say,
providing direct utility), neo-classical models predict that it would be optimal for it to behave in
a similar way to private consumption and hence would be acyclical in the presence of complete
markets (Riascos and Végh, 2003).
In contrast to Keynesian and neo-classical recommendations, recent empirical literature
has noted that while fiscal policy is acyclical or countercyclical in developed countries, it is
procyclical in most developing countries, with fiscal policy probably exacerbating the business
cycle in those countries. This begs the question of why these countries follow policies that tend
to create macroeconomic instability. Theoretical models suggest two possible explanations. The
first one relies on the presence of distortions in international capital markets. For example, Gavin
and Perotti (1997), Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2004), and Guerson (2004) argue that
developing countries face credit constraints that prevent them from borrowing in bad times.
2

Hence, they are ‘forced’ to repay in bad times, which requires a contractionary fiscal policy. In
the same vein, Riascos and Végh (2003) show that incomplete markets could explain procyclical
fiscal policy as the outcome of a Ramsey problem without having to impose any additional
frictions.
The second strand of the literature relies on a political economy explanation. For
example, Tornell and Lane (1999) develop a model in which competition for a common pool of
funds among different units (ministries, provinces) leads to the so-called ‘voracity effect,’
whereby expenditure could actually exceed a given windfall. Taking as given such a political
distortion, Talvi and Végh (2005) show how policymakers would find it optimal to run smaller
primary surpluses in good times by increasing government spending and reducing tax rates.2
While political distortions can be present in all countries, a number of authors have
concluded that these distortions can be more widespread in resource-rich economies where nonresource taxes are low and resource rents are high. For example, Lane and Tornell (1996) argue
that resource-rich economies are subject to more extreme rent-seeking behavior than resourcepoor economies because national politics is oriented to appropriating the rents earned by the
natural resource endowments. In their model, a windfall coming from a terms-of-trade
improvement can lead to sharp increases in spending, a distorted allocation of spending over
time, dissipated revenues, and a collapse in growth.
There is also an important literature that links fiscal policy with exchange rate regimes.
Conventional wisdom indicates that fixed exchange rates provide more fiscal discipline than
flexible exchange rates (see, for example, Frenkel, Goldstein, and Masson (1991); Aghevli,
Khan, and Montiel (1991); and Giavazzi and Pagano (1988)). The claim is that fixed rates induce
more discipline because the sustained adoption of lax fiscal policies must eventually lead to a
depletion of foreign exchange reserves and thus to a politically costly collapse of the peg. In
contrast, Tornell and Velasco (2000) argue that flexible exchange rate regimes trigger more
austere fiscal policies. They examine the role of exchange rate regimes using an intertemporal
model with endogenous optimal fiscal policy. In this model, loose fiscal policies are costly under
both fixed and flexible exchange rates. While under fixed exchange rates bad behavior today

leads to punishment tomorrow (when reserves are depleted and a costly currency crisis starts),
under flexible exchange rates unsound fiscal policy manifests itself immediately through
movements in the exchange rate. The difference is in the intertemporal distribution of these
costs. They show that if fiscal authorities are impatient, flexible rates – by forcing the costs to be
paid up-front – provide more fiscal discipline and higher welfare for the representative agent.
Finally, the last strand of the literature on suboptimal macropolicies concludes that
distortionary macroeconomic policies are likely to be symptoms of underlying institutional
problems, such as lack of enforcement of property rights and repudiation of contracts. As
Acemoglu et al (2003) conclude, in societies with institutional problems, politicians may be
forced to pursue unsustainable policies in order to satisfy various groups and remain in power.
III. Fiscal Stance and Terms of Trade Cycles: A Tale of Two Countries
To grasp the distinct characteristics of cycles in the terms of trade and the fiscal stance
around the world, visual evidence from two commodity-exporting countries is presented. The
first country is a developing economy, Argentina, the second one is a developed economy,
Norway. On average, the share of commodity exports in total exports in both countries oscillates
around 70 percent. Figure 1 shows the cycles in the terms of trade as well as the cycles in
government expenditure, government revenues, and the primary balance. In this figure and also
in the panel estimations in Section IV, I identify cycles by using the ubiquitous Hodrick-Prescott
(HP) filter. Figure 1 also reports pairwise correlations between the cyclical components of the
terms of trade and the fiscal stance for the two economies. While these correlations only provide
a metric of contemporaneous comovements, Section IV explores potential temporal causal
patterns.3
It should also be noted that only government expenditure provides a measure of
discretionary fiscal policy. As discussed extensively in Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2004),
government revenues and the primary balance depend on the tax base (output or in this case the
terms of trade), with the correlations between these two indicators and output (or terms of trade)
3

Both fiscal and terms of trade indicators are obtained from the WEO database of the International Monetary Fund
and are described in Table A1 in the appendix.

providing in most cases ambiguous information on the cyclicality of fiscal policy.4 Still, in order
to examine whether the fiscal stance tends to be loose when the terms of trade improve, the paper
is also concerned with the cycles in government revenues and primary balance.
As shown in the top panel of Figure 1, while government expenditure is highly
countercyclical in Norway, this is not the case in Argentina where government expenditure
becomes increasingly procyclical since the early 1990s. Again, the evidence from the middle and
lower panels indicates that booms in the terms of trade in Argentina did not trigger higher public
savings; in fact, the primary balance is below trend when Argentina’s terms of trade improve.
The evidence from Norway is in stark contrast, with the fiscal stance improving with booms in
the terms of trade.
IV. Panel Estimation
Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2004) examine the cyclical characteristics of fiscal and
monetary policies around the world and find that developing countries (in particular, middle
income countries) follow procyclical policies while industrialised countries implement acyclical
or countercyclical policies. In a similar vein, this paper documents the relationship between
booms and busts in the terms of trade and government expenditure and revenues, primary
balances, and inflation. The purpose of this paper is not to examine the cyclical characteristics of
fiscal policy but to evaluate whether fiscal positions of countries around the world deteriorate or
improve with terms of trade cycles.
As discussed in Section II, political and institutional distortions are at the core of models
of suboptimal fiscal policy. Since these distortions are more widespread in developing countries,
I examine separately the evidence on countries grouped by income levels. The World Bank
classification in 2008 is used to divide the sample into groups of low-income, lower-middleincome, upper-middle-income, and high-income (OECD) countries (see the Appendix for
details).

4

For example, tax revenues = tax rate × tax base. Suppose the government follows a procyclical fiscal policy. Since,
by definition, the tax rate goes down in good times (and vice versa) but the tax base moves in the opposite direction,
the correlation of tax revenues with the business (or terms of trade) cycle is ambiguous.

5

Even within the panel estimation by income groups, I also examine the possibility of nonlinear relationships between the various measures of the fiscal stance and fluctuations in the
terms of trade as suggested by the various models of fiscal policy.
First, as discussed in Gavin and Perotti (1997), I examine whether the relationship
between the fiscal stance and the terms of trade depends on the degree of liquidity in
international capital markets, that is, on the ability of countries to tap international capital
markets. To identify liquidity in international capital markets, I follow Reinhart and Reinhart
(2008) who identify capital flow bonanza episodes country by country5 using a sample of 181
countries and then tally, year by year, the number of countries with capital flow bonanzas. An
index of worldwide bonanzas is then constructed. This index indicates the proportion of
countries with an episode of capital flow bonanza in any given year.

I identify episodes of

worldwide capital flow bonanzas when the Reinhart and Reinhart index indicates that at least 20
percent of the countries are found to be having a capital flow bonanza. This metric identifies
1978-1983, 1991-1993, 1998, and 2005-2008 as periods of worldwide capital flow bonanza.
Second, models with liquidity constraints and overall imperfections in capital markets
also suggest that fiscal responses in bad states (when, for example, terms of trade deteriorate)
may be more procyclical than those in good times, with government introducing draconian
reforms in response to a collapse in the terms of trade due to lack of access to credit. Thus, I also
examine whether the fiscal stance responds asymmetrically to booms and busts in the terms of
trade. I identify good times (terms of trade booms) as those years when the terms of trade are
above their trend and bad times (terms of trade busts) as those years when they are below their
trend, with the trend estimated with the Hodrick-Prescott filter.
Third, the response of the fiscal stance to terms of trade fluctuations may depend on the
exchange rate regime. To test for this, episodes of fixed and floating exchange rate regimes are
identified by using the Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) de facto exchange rate regime classification.
For this paper, it is enough to define two exchange rate regimes: fixed or predetermined
exchange rates, and flexible exchange rates (which are defined as including any regime in which

5

For each country, a capital flow bonanza year is one with a large current account deficit, defined as a current
account balance in the 20th percentile.

6

the exchange rate is allowed some flexibility). Flexible exchange rate regimes include clean
floats (which are rare) and dirty floats (which are more common).
Fourth, many have argued that fiscal authorities tend to believe that good times are more
permanent than they really are, leading to too much spending or a reduction in tax rates in times
of terms of trade booms. According to this hypothesis, the fiscal stance responds equally to
transitory and persistent terms of trade shocks. To examine this hypothesis, I classify shocks into
transitory and persistent following the analysis in Kent and Cashin (2003). These authors
estimate equations of the form:
Δtot i ,t = ci + φ i Δtot i ,t −1 + μ i ,t

(1)

where Δtot is the growth rate of the terms of trade. The coefficient φ captures the degree of
persistence of the shocks, with shocks becoming more persistent as φ approaches 1 in absolute
value. Again, following Kent and Cashin (2003), transitory and permanent terms of trade shocks
are separated by first estimating the half-life of a shock (HLS):
HLS = abs (log(1 / 2) / log(φ ))

(2)

For each income group, countries with persistent terms of trade shocks are identified as those
countries with shocks that have a half-life larger than the median value of the half-life of shocks
in the group. The rest of the countries are identified as countries with transitory terms of trade
shocks.6
Finally, I also examine whether responses to terms of trade shocks are different in
resource-abundant economies. The IMF (WEO) classification scheme is used to identify
resource-abundant countries as those where commodity-related export earnings account for more
than half of total export earnings. Using the United Nations COMTRADE data provided by the
UN Statistical Department, for each country and for every year of the sample, the share of non
fuel primary products commodity exports (Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) 0,
1 2, 4, and 68) plus fuel exports (SITC 3) in total exports is calculated. For each country, a

6

The classification of countries into countries with persistent terms of trade shocks and those with transitory terms
of trade shocks is done using all sample data. Governments do not have all of this information when deciding on
spending and taxes and thus may not respond optimally to shocks with different degrees of persistence.

7

dummy variable is created that is equal to one when commodity export shares are above 50 per
cent and zero otherwise.
As in Section III, cycles in the fiscal stance, economic activity, and the terms of trade are
identified using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter. The indicators are obtained from the IMF
(WEO) database and are described in Table A1 of the appendix.
To examine the links between the fiscal stance and the terms of trade the following
regression using fixed effects panel techniques is estimated. Each regression takes the form:

cYi ,t = α i + β ctoti ,t + γ ctoti ,t × I i ,jt + δ X i ,t + ε i ,t

(3)

where cY represents alternatively the cycle in government expenditure, government revenue, the
primary balance and inflation; ctot is the cycle in the terms of trade; I is an indicator used to
examine the presence of non-linearities; and X captures the state of the business cycle, that is, the
output cycle of each country.
The simplest strategy is to estimate the model in Equation (3) using ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions. However, cycles in economic activity as captured by cycles in GDP are
endogenous, so we may be capturing reverse causality. In this case, OLS regressions will give
results that do not correspond to the causal effect of economic activity on the fiscal stance. Thus,
Equation (3) is estimated using Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) with lagged values of GDP
cycles as instruments for current values of GDP cycles.
In the regressions, I test sequentially each possible non-linearity between the fiscal stance
and the terms of trade. More precisely, when examining for the effect of liquid international
capital markets, the index I is equal to one during episodes of worldwide capital flow bonanzas
and zero otherwise. When examining the presence of asymmetric responses to booms and busts
in the terms of trade, the index I is equal to one when the country experiences a terms of trade
boom and zero otherwise. When studying whether countries respond differently to transitory and
permanent terms of trade shocks, I is equal to one for countries with permanent shocks and zero
otherwise. When evaluating whether the exchange rate regime matters, the indicator I is equal to
one when the country adopts a flexible exchange rate regime and zero otherwise. Finally, when
studying whether resource-abundant economies respond differently to terms of trade shocks, I is
equal to one for resource-abundant countries and zero otherwise. That is, the coefficient β will
capture, respectively, the response of the fiscal indicator to terms of trade fluctuations in times of
8

illiquidity in world capital markets, in times when the terms of trade are not booming, in
countries with transitory terms-of-trade shocks, in years of fixed exchange rate regimes, and in
countries which are not resource-abundant. β + γ will capture, respectively, the response of the
fiscal indicators to terms of trade shocks at times of capital flow bonanzas, in times of booms in
the terms of trade, in countries with permanent terms-of-trade shocks, in years with flexible
exchange rates and in resource-abundant countries.
Tables 1–4 show the panel regressions for cycles in government primary balances,
government revenues, government spending, and inflation, respectively. Four panel models are
estimated separately according to income groups: high-income (OECD) countries, upper-middleincome countries, lower–middle-income countries, and low-income countries.
For each fiscal indicator, there are 6 regressions. The top regression provides the
benchmark. The other five regressions allow for non-linearities in the responses to terms of trade
shocks. Each regression includes the terms of trade cycle; the coefficient of this variable is β
(from Equation 3). The next variable captures the possible non-linear effects. The coefficient on
this variable is γ (from Equation 3). The final variable is the GDP cycle. The coefficient of this
variable is δ (from Equation 3).
Table 1 shows the relationship between cycles in fiscal primary balances and cycles in
the terms of trade and overall GDP. It is important to highlight the varied responses across the
different income groups. First, fiscal balances in OECD countries increase when output is above
trend, suggesting the presence of countercyclical or acyclical fiscal policies.7 This is not the case
in developing countries. In middle-income countries, fiscal balances tend to decline when output
is above trend, suggesting more procyclical policies, while in low-income countries, fiscal
balances are uncorrelated with GDP cycles. To examine whether the responses are economically
significant, I estimate the elasticity of fiscal balances to GDP cycles (evaluated at the mean value
of primary-balance and GDP cycles).8 The elasticities of primary balances with respect to GDP
cycles are: 2.00 for OECD countries, -0.60 for upper-middle-income countries, and -0.04 for

7

Even if government expenditure and tax rates do not change (acyclical policy), primary balances improve with
increases in output.

8

I use the mean of the absolute value of the primary balance and GDP cycles since by construction, these cycles
have zero mean.

lower-middle-income countries, indicating strong responses in both high-income and uppermiddle-income countries.

Second, fiscal balances in OECD and low-income countries are not

affected by terms of trade cycles. Third, primary balances responses to terms of trade cycles in
middle-income countries are affected by the extent of liquidity in international capital markets,
episodes of terms of trade booms or busts, and exchange rate regimes. As shown in regression
(1), in times of international capital market liquidity, the response of fiscal balances to terms of
trade cycles in lower-middle-income countries is negative, with the fiscal balance deteriorating
in good times (when the terms of trade are above trend) and improving in bad times (when they
are below trend), suggesting procyclical responses to terms-of-trade fluctuations.

In the case of

upper-middle-income countries, the response of fiscal balances to terms of trade cycles while
still positive in episodes of capital flow bonanza it is significantly smaller indicating a less
countercyclical policy than during episodes of illiquidity in international capital markets. For
upper-middle-income countries, the elasticity of fiscal balances to terms of trade cycles is equal
to 2.00 in times of illiquid international capital markets and 1.00 in episodes of capital flow
bonanza. The corresponding elasticity for lower-middle-income countries is respectively 0.40
and -0.10. Also, as shown in regression (2), there is evidence of asymmetric responses to terms
of trade booms and busts. The fiscal balance of upper- and lower-middle-income countries
responds less countercyclically in times of terms of trade booms. Again in this case, responses in
upper-middle-income countries are stronger in terms of elasticity (2.00 and 1.00 for uppermiddle-income countries and 0.30 and -0.10 for lower-middle-income countries, respectively for
times of terms of trade busts and for times of terms of trade booms). Furthermore, as shown in
regression (3), responses to terms of trade cycles in middle-income countries depend on the
exchange rate regime. Flexible exchange rate regimes seem to fuel more countercyclical fiscal
policies in both upper–middle and lower-middle-income countries, providing some support to the
model in Tornell and Velasco (2000). Third, as shown in regression (4), for most income
groups, the degree of persistence of terms of trade shocks does not seem to matter. Surprisingly,
primary balances of upper-middle-income countries tend to improve more in countries with more
persistent terms of trade.9 Fourth, responses to terms of trade cycles in commodity-abundant
9

These results should be interpreted with caution since the degree of persistence of terms of trade shocks is
estimated by using information on the evolution of terms of trade for all of the sample period. Governments in
contrast may underestimate or overestimate the degree of persistence of shocks by using available past information.

10

countries are significantly different from those in non-commodity producing economies only in
the upper–middle-income group.
Table 2 shows the responses of government revenues to fluctuations in the terms of trade.
As in the previous table, all the regressions control for cycles in GDP and allow for non-linear
responses to terms of trade shocks. While the results in this table indicate that fiscal revenues
increase with output across all groups of countries, these responses are far stronger in OECD
countries. For the high-income group, the elasticity is equal to 0.80. In contrast, the elasticities of
government revenues with respect to the cycles in GDP vary from 0.03 for lower-middle-income
countries and 0.32 in low-income countries, with the elasticity of upper-middle-income countries
equal to 0.12. Again, the responses to terms of trade cycles in middle-income countries are
different from those in OECD and low-income countries. In OECD and low-income countries,
government revenues are uncorrelated with terms of trade cycles. For middle-income countries,
Table 2 indicates that while there is an overall positive link between government revenues and
terms of trade cycles (a sign of either countercyclical or acyclical responses to terms of trade
shocks), this link is weaker or even reversed in times of international capital flow bonanzas and
in episodes of terms of trade booms (evidence of more procyclical responses to terms of trade
cycles). Table 2 also shows that the exchange rate regime affects the responses of government
revenues to terms of trade cycles. Again, for upper-middle-income countries, responses of
government revenues to terms of trade cycles tend to be more countercyclical during floating
exchange rates, with elasticities of 0.60 and 0.20 under flexible exchange rate and fixed
exchange rate regimes, respectively. In contrast, for lower-middle-income countries, fiscal
revenues seem to become more procyclical during flexible exchange rate regimes. Lastly, as
shown in Regression 5, government revenues in middle income countries are only positively
related to terms of trade cycles in resource abundant countries.
Table 3 shows the responses of government spending to terms of trade cycles and the
overall business cycle. Supporting previous results in the literature, Table 3 shows that responses
to GDP cycles in OECD countries are countercyclical, while they are procyclical in all
developing countries (as captured by the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the
GDP cycle). Responses to terms of trade cycles are also different across countries in different
income groups. Overall, terms of trade cycles do not affect government spending in OECD and
11

low-income countries.

Interestingly, responses of government spending to terms of trade

fluctuations are countercyclical in upper–middle-income countries but procyclical in lowermiddle-income countries. Importantly, when examining the role of the exchange rate regime in
the responses to terms of trade shocks, the evidence suggests that government spending in
middle-income countries is countercyclical only when exchange rates are floating.
Table 4 links inflation to fluctuations in the terms of trade. The experience in low- and
middle-income countries with bouts of hyperinflation and overall chronic inflation during most
of the years of the sample examined suggests that terms of trade fluctuations are not the main
drivers of inflation. The results in Table 4 confirm this expectation. The evidence for OECD
countries indicates that overall inflation increases when economic activity is strong.
Interestingly, inflation declines with increases in the terms of trade, suggesting perhaps the
effects of lower commodity prices since most of the OECD countries are commodity importers.10
Table 5 examines in more detail the responses of the fiscal stance to terms of trade cycles
in resource abundant countries. This table only reports the responses in upper-middle-income
countries because the results in Tables 1-3 indicate that it is in this group of countries where the
fiscal stance responds significantly different in commodity-producing countries. In particular,
Table 5 explores whether responses to terms of trade cycles in resource-abundant countries are
affected by episodes of capital flow bonanzas, terms of trade booms and busts, and fixed and
flexible exchange rate regimes. The estimated regression in Table 5 is
com

cYi ,t = α i + β ctoti ,t + γ ctoti ,t × I icom
,t + ρ ctoti ,t × I i ,t × I i ,t + δ X i ,t + ε i ,t

(4)

where: I com captures whether the country is a commodity-abundant country; and I j captures
alternately the episodes of capital flow bonanzas, booms in the terms of trade, and episodes of
flexible exchange rate regimes.
As in Tables 1-3, the results in Table 5 indicate that terms of trade cycles in the uppermiddle-income group only affect the fiscal stance in commodity-abundant countries. While fiscal
policy in upper-middle-income countries is procyclical with respect to fluctuations in GDP, it is
countercyclical with respect to terms of trade fluctuations. However, the degree of
countercyclicality declines sharply in episodes of capital flow bonanza and in times of booms in
10

It may also reflect the effect of an appreciation of the exchange rate when the terms of trade are high. This is also
consistent with the stronger effect for flexible exchange rate regimes.

12

the terms of trade, suggesting that the claim that “all that glitters might not be gold” may in fact
have some support. In particular, the combination of booms in the terms of trade and the increase
in liquidity in international capital markets from 2003 to 2008 may have fueled an easy fiscal
policy in commodity-abundant countries with access to international capital markets. In contrast,
the results in Table 5 suggest that the degree of countercyclicality increases during episodes of
flexible exchange rates. The results on the links between exchange rate regimes and fiscal policy
are preliminary and need to be examined in a larger sample of commodity-abundant countries,
but the possibility that flexible exchange rates may contribute to less distortionary fiscal policies
merits our full attention.
V. Conclusions
This paper has examined the links between the fiscal stance and terms of trade cycles.
While still much more analysis needs to be undertaken to refine our understanding of the links
between the terms of trade fluctuations and fiscal policies, the main findings of the paper can be
summarized as follows:
i) Confirming the results in the empirical literature, the results in this paper indicate that
fiscal policy is countercyclical in OECD countries (vis à vis GDP). In contrast, fiscal
policy is procyclical (vis à vis GDP) in developing countries.
ii) In OECD and low-income countries, fiscal policy is acyclical with regards to the
terms of trade. Moreover, the responses of the fiscal stance to terms of trade cycles
are not affected by international capital liquidity, exchange rate regimes, or the degree
of persistence of the shocks.
iii) For

upper-middle-income

countries,

there

is

evidence

of

fiscal

policy

countercyclicality with respect to the terms of trade. But the degree of
countercyclicality declines in episodes of capital flow bonanzas or during episodes of
terms of trade booms, suggesting that in those episodes these countries may not be
saving enough for a rainy day. Importantly, flexible exchange rate regimes seem to
contribute to a more countercyclical fiscal policy.
iv) For lower-middle-income countries, there is even evidence suggesting that fiscal
policy responds procyclically to terms of trade fluctuations, that is, there is evidence
13

that fiscal policy contributes to reinforce the terms of trade cycle. Again, as in uppermiddle-income countries, episodes of capital flow bonanza and terms of trade boom
fuel even more procyclicality while flexible exchange rate regimes enhance
countercyclicality.11
These findings suggest that the boom in commodity prices during the latest episode of
capital flow bonanza of 2003-2008 may have fueled a procyclical policy in middle-income
countries that reinforced the terms of trade cycle. While a variety of models explain why
countries follow these suboptimal fiscal policies, we need to find mechanisms that would enable
macro-policies to be conducted in a neutral or stabilizing way. In this regard, the suggestive
results on flexible exchange rates for upper–middle-income countries deserve our full attention.

11

I should note that in lower-middle-income countries, flexible exchange rates seem to contribute to lower
government revenues when the terms of trade increase. However, this effect is not significant from an economic
point of view. The elasticity of the government revenues with respect to terms of trade cycles in these countries are
quite small: 0.04 for fixed exchange rates and 0 for flexible exchange rates.

Notes: The above figures show the cycles in government expenditure, revenues, and the primary balance together with the cycles in the terms of trade for Argentina and Norway. The cycles are
estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. The correlation statistics in each panel show the pairwise correlation between each indicator of fiscal policy cycles and the terms of trade cycles.
