ABSTRACT
We investigate the relationship between uncertainty about monetary policy and its transmission
mechanism, and economic fluctuations. We propose a new term structure model where the
second moments of macroeconomic variables and yields can have a first-order effect on their
dynamics. The data favors a model with two unspanned volatility factors that capture uncertainty
about monetary policy and the term premium. Uncertainty contributes negatively to economic
activity. Two dimensions of uncertainty react in opposite directions to a shock to the real
economy, and the response of inflation to uncertainty shocks vary across different historical
episodes.

Introduction

We investigate the relationship between uncertainty about monetary policy and its transmission mechanism, and economic fluctuations. The core question of interest is: does uncertainty
about monetary policy have a real effect? An equally important question is: how do macroeconomic shocks influence interest rate uncertainty? While numerous studies have focused on
monetary policy and its transmission mechanism, less attention has been placed on understanding uncertainty surrounding this transmission mechanism and their relation with the
real economy. We study these questions by introducing a new term structure model with
two novel features. First, we jointly model the first and second moments of macroeconomic
variables and yields: uncertainty is extracted from their volatility, and it has a direct impact
on the conditional means of these variables in a vector autoregression (VAR).1
Second, we decompose uncertainty of interest rates into two economic dimensions: the
policy component, and the market transmission component captured by the term premium.
Public commentary by policy-makers at central banks worldwide indicates that the term
premium is one of the most important pieces of information extracted from the term structure
of interest rates. Understanding the term premium and its uncertainty is crucial in making
policy decisions and evaluating how successful monetary policy is in achieving its goals.
We contribute to the term structure literature by devising a no-arbitrage model with
multiple unspanned stochastic volatility factors, i.e., the factors driving volatility are distinct
from the factors driving yields. We show that our model can successfully fit the data for
both the cross section of yields and their volatility, and the data suggests two volatility
factors. We introduce a new rotation to the literature to capture the factor structure in an
economically meaningful way. We decompose the long term interest rate into the expectation
component and the term premium component. The former is agents’ expectation about the
future path of monetary policy, which the central bank can influence through policies like
forward guidance. The latter relies on the market, and captures how monetary policy gets
1

We define uncertainty as log volatility.

propagated from the short term interest rate to long term interest rates. The new rotation
utilizes this decomposition and sets the three yield factors to be the short term interest
rate, the expectation component of the long rate, and the term premium component. The
two volatility factors are for the short rate and term premium, which can be conveniently
interpreted as uncertainty about monetary policy and its transmission mechanism.
We document the relationship between interest rate uncertainty and economic fluctuations through impulse responses. Uncertainty is countercyclical, and precedes worse economic
conditions and higher unemployment rates. This finding is consistent with the existing literature on uncertainty. What sets this paper apart from the literature is that our focus is
on two aspects of interest rate uncertainty. The distinction between the two dimension lies
in how they react to news about the real economy. A higher unemployment rate leads to
higher uncertainty about term premia, which reflects the market’s reaction to bad economic
news. In contrast, uncertainty about monetary policy decreases in response to the same
news. This is consistent with the Fed’s proactive response to combat crisis historically.
One benefit of jointly modeling the first and second moments simultaneously is to allow
the impulse responses to vary through time depending on the state of the economy. This is
not possible for the models in the literature, unless they have time-varying autoregressive
coefficients. Empirically, the response of inflation to uncertainty shocks varies through time.
For example, in response to a positive shock to monetary policy uncertainty, inflation kept
going up during the Great Inflation, when high inflation was considered bad for the economy.
In contrast, inflation decreased in response to the same shock during Volcker’s tenure. This
is consistent with Volcker’s reputation as an inflation hawk. It also barely responded during
the Great Recession, when the concern is centered around deflation. These demonstrate
the non-cyclical feature of inflation. A positive shock to term premia uncertainty leads to
a positive reaction of inflation during Greenspan’s Conundrum, and a negative reaction for
the Volcker period. The former adds additional evidence of the importance of the term
premium during that period. All of these economically meaningful distinctions can only be

3

observed through time-varying impulse responses. Standard impulse responses are close to
zero, insignificant and potentially misleading, because they are averages of the positive and
negative time-varying impulse responses.
Our historical decomposition further quantifies the two-way link between the real economy and interest rate uncertainty. Historically monetary policy uncertainty has contributed
negatively to the inflation rate, which heightened at -0.7% after the Great Recession, placing further deflationary pressure during that period. Both monetary policy uncertainty and
term premium uncertainty added positively to the unemployment rate historically. The contribution of monetary policy uncertainty peaked in the early 1980s at about 0.55%, while
that of term premium uncertainty had peaks in the early 70s, early 80s and mid 2000s at
the highest of 0.7%. The peak in the 2000’s is associated with Greenspan’s Conundrum,
where our empirical evidence is consistent with the popular view that the term premium
and its uncertainty increased. How monetary policy uncertainty and term premium uncertainty factor into unemployment differs since the Great Recession, with the former becoming
negative potentially due to less uncertainty surrounding monetary policy, and the latter remaining positive with still significant uncertainty in the market. Consistent with our impulse
responses, inflation contributed positively to both uncertainty measures in the 1980s, and
negatively at the beginning and end of our sample period. The contributions of unemployment rate shocks to monetary policy uncertainty and term premium uncertainty take
opposite signs. This is further evidence of the two dimensions of uncertainty.
Our paper contributes to the econometrics literature on estimation of vector autoregressions with stochastic volatility. When volatility enters the conditional mean of a vector
autoregression, the popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for stochastic
volatility models of Kim, Shephard, and Chib(1998) cannot be used. We develop a MCMC
algorithm based on the particle Gibbs sampler which are efficient and can handle a wide range
of models. We are the first to introduce this algorithm into the macro-finance literature.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We describe our relationship to the

4

literatures in Subsection 1.1. Section 2 presents the new term structure model together with
the new rotation. Section 3 describes the MCMC and particle filtering algorithms used for
estimation. In Section 4, we study the economic implications of interest rate uncertainty.
Section 5 demonstrates how a collection of models with different specifications fit the yield
curve. Section 6 concludes.

1.1

Related Literature

Our paper is closely related to recent advances in the literatures on uncertainty and the
term structure of interest rates. First, our paper contributes to the fast growing literature
on the role that uncertainty shocks play in macroeconomic fluctuations, asset prices and
monetary policy; see, e.g. Bloom(2014) for a survey; Baker, Bloom, and Davis(2015), Jurado,
Ludvigson, and Ng(2015), Bekaert, Hoerova, and Lo Duca(2013), and Aastveit, Natvik, and
Sola(2013) for empirical evidence; and Ulrich(2012), Pástor and Veronesi(2012) and Pástor
and Veronesi(2013) for theoretical models.
We differ from the empirical papers in the uncertainty literature in the following ways: (i)
We internalize the uncertainty: in our model, uncertainty serves both as the second moment
of macroeconomic variables and yields (the factors driving the volatility of inflation, unemployment, and interest rates) and it directly impacts the first moment of macroeconomic
variables. In contrast, the uncertainty literature typically extracts an estimate of uncertainty
in a data pre-processing step, often as the second moment of observed macroeconomic or
financial time series. Researchers then use this estimate in a second step as an observable
variable in a homoskedastic vector autoregression. (ii) This literature has so far focused on
one dimension of uncertainty, whether it’s policy uncertainty or macroeconomic uncertainty.
We discuss two dimensions of interest rate uncertainty, and their distinct economic implications. (iii) Different from the rest of the literature, we focus on uncertainty about monetary
policy and its transmission mechanism.
Our paper is also related to the VAR literature with stochastic volatility; see Cogley and
5

Sargent(2001), Cogley and Sargent(2005), and Primiceri(2005) for examples. We adopt a
similar approach to modeling the time-varying covariance matrix as Primiceri(2005). Although they use a different modeling approach, Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana,
Rubio-Ramı́rez, and Uribe(2011) also study the real effect of volatility on the (real) interest
rate, in an open emerging economy setting. A recent paper by Mumtaz and Zanetti(2013)
is closely related to ours in terms of how we specify the factor dynamics. Both papers allow
the volatility factors to enter the conditional mean and have a first order impact on key
macroeconomic aggregates. This is absent from most of the existing models in this literature, and we show its importance through impulse responses. The main difference between
our paper and Mumtaz and Zanetti(2013) is that our paper introduces a factor structure for
the volatilities, and ties these factors into a no-arbitrage term structure model. Our paper
also introduces a new and more efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm known as a
particle Gibbs sampler, Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein(2010), that can be used for a wide
variety of multivariate time series models.
Finally, we contribute to the term structure literature by introducing a flexible way to
simultaneously fit yields and their volatilities at different maturities. In the earlier literature,
e.g. Dai and Singleton(2000) and Duffee(2002), volatility factors must simultaneously fit
both the level of yields and their volatility. The factors from estimated models end up
fitting the conditional mean of yields, and consequently they do not accurately estimate the
conditional volatility. To break the tension, Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein(2002) proposed
the class of unspanned stochastic volatility (USV) models which separate the dynamics of
volatility from yield factors.2 Creal and Wu(2015b) showed that USV models do improve
the fit of volatility, but restrict the cross-sectional fit of yields at the same time. More
importantly, the existing literature on USV models typically stops at one volatility factor.
Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Jones(2009) point to the necessity of multiple unspanned
2
Prior empirical work that studies whether volatility is priced using interest rate derivatives or high
frequency data includes Bikbov and Chernov(2009), Andersen and Benzoni(2010), Joslin(2010), Mueller,
Vedolin, and Yen(2011), and Christensen, Lopez, and Rudebusch(2014).

6

volatility factors, and Joslin(2015) implemented a version with two volatility factors where
only one is unspanned. Our model falls into the USV classification. The difference from the
existing USV models is that we do not restrict the cross sectional fit of the model, and we
are the first to implement models with more than one unspanned volatility factor. In related
work, Cieslak and Povala(2015) estimate a model with multiple spanned volatilities, where
they use additional information from realized volatility to effectively place more weight in
the objective function (such as the likelihood function) for the factors to fit the volatility.
Our dynamic setup is related to the GARCH-M (GARCH-in-mean) literature within a
VAR; see, e.g. Engle, Lilien, and Robins(1987) and Elder(2004). The difference is that
we use stochastic volatility instead of GARCH to model time-varying variances, meaning
that volatility has its own innovations and is not a deterministic function of past data.
This is important because with our framework, we can use tools from the VAR literature
such as impulse responses to study the influence of an uncertainty shock. This is not directly
available in GARCH-M type models because there is no separate shock to volatility. Jo(2014)
is similar to our paper in this spirit: while her focus is the uncertainty of oil prices shocks,
we focus on uncertainty shocks from the term structure of interest rates.

Models

This section proposes a new macro finance term structure model to capture the dynamic
relationship between interest rate uncertainty and the macroeconomy. Our model has the
following unique features. First, uncertainty – originating from the volatility of the yield
curve and macroeconomic variables – has a first order impact on the macroeconomy. Second,
our model captures multiple dimensions of yield volatility in a novel way. In our setting,
fitting the yield volatility does not constrain bond prices. Besides the flexibility of fitting
the volatility, our pricing formula remains simple and straightforward.

7

2.1

Dynamics

The model has a M × 1 vector of macroeconomic variables mt , and a G × 1 vector of
conditionally Gaussian yield factors gt that drive bond prices. The H × 1 vector of factors
ht determine the volatility of macroeconomic variables and yields, and we refer to them as
uncertainty factors. The total number of factors is F = M + G + H.
The factors jointly follow a vector autoregression with stochastic volatility. Specifically,
the macroeconomic variables follow

mt+1 = µm + Φm mt + Φmg gt + Φmh ht + Σm Dm,t εm,t+1 .

(1)

The dynamics for the yield factors are

gt+1 = µg + Φgm mt + Φg gt + Φgh ht + Σgm Dm,t εm,t+1 + Σg Dg,t εg,t+1 .

(2)

The diagonal time-varying volatility is a function of the uncertainty factors ht

.

(3)

The factors ht have dynamics

ht+1 = µh + Φh ht + Σhm εm,t+1 + Σhg εg,t+1 + Σh εh,t+1 .

(4)

The shocks are jointly i.i.d. normal (ε0m,t+1 , ε0g,t+1 , ε0h,t+1 )0 ∼ N (0, I), with the contemporaneous correlations captured through the matrices Σgm , Σhm and Σhg .
We collect the state variables into the vector ft = (m0t , gt0 , h0t )0 and write the system (1) (4) as a vector autoregression

ft+1 = µf + Φf ft + Σt εt+1 .
8

(5)

We define µ̄f ≡ (I − Φf )−1 µf as the unconditional mean.
We use a recursive scheme for identification. The identifying assumptions between the
macroeconomic and yield factors are similar to standard assumptions made in the VAR literature; i.e. macroeconomic variables are slow moving and do not react to contemporaneous
monetary policy shocks; but monetary policy does respond to contemporaneous macroeconomic shocks; see, e.g. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans(1999), Stock and Watson(2001),
Bernanke, Boivin, and Eliasz(2005), and Wu and Xia(2015). We order the volatility factors
after the macroeconomic and yield factors, so that uncertainty shocks are not contaminated
by the first moment shocks. We also order interest rate uncertainty after macroeconomic
uncertainty, so that our interest rate uncertainty shocks do not simply reflect macroeconomic uncertainty; i.e. they capture additional variation above and beyond what can be
explained by macroeconomic uncertainty. Note that there are alternative approaches to identifying monetary policy shocks including long run restrictions (Blanchard and Quah(1989)),
external instruments (Gertler and Karadi(2015)), narrative-based/green book (Romer and
Romer(2004)), and conditional heteroskedasticity (Wright(2012)).
Of critical importance for our analysis, the uncertainty factors ht impact the macroeconomy through the conditional mean term Φmh ht in (1), and are identified from the conditional
variance of observed macroeconomic data and yields through Dmt and Dgt . This unique
combination unifies two literatures; the literature on VARs with stochastic volatility (e.g.
Cogley and Sargent(2001), Cogley and Sargent(2005), and Primiceri(2005)) and the more
recent uncertainty literature that uses VARs to study uncertainty and the macroeconomy
and/or asset-prices (e.g. Baker, Bloom, and Davis(2015), Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng(2015),
Bekaert, Hoerova, and Lo Duca(2013), and Aastveit, Natvik, and Sola(2013)).
To ensure stability, the conditional mean of ht+1 does not depend on the levels of gt or mt .
Otherwise, the system will be explosive even if the modulus of the eigenvalues of Φf in (5)
are all less than one. To compensate for this restriction, we allow contemporaneous shocks of
macroeconomic variables εm,t+1 and yields εg,t+1 to drive ht+1 . The timing assumption that

9

today’s shocks to the macroeconomy or yields determine their volatility next period makes
intuitive sense.3
We follow the macroeconomics literature and use a log-normal process for the volatility
in (1) - (4). The matrices Γ0 and Γ1 permit a factor structure within the covariance matrix
and allow us to estimate models where the number of volatility factors and yield factors may
differ with M + G 6= H.

2.2

Bond prices

Zero coupon bonds are priced to permit no arbitrage opportunities. The literature on affine
term structure models demonstrates that to have ht realistically capture yield volatility, it
cannot price bonds; see, e.g. Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Jones(2009) and Creal and
Wu(2015b). We also follow Joslin, Priebsch, and Singleton(2014) and assume the macro
factors mt are unspanned. In our model, this means that the yield factors gt summarize all
the information for the cross section of the yield curve.
The short rate is an affine function of gt :
0
rt = δ0 + δ1,g
gt .

(6)

The risk neutral Q measure adjusts the probability distribution in (2) to incorporate investors’ risk premium, and is defined such that the price of an asset is equal to the present
value of its expected payoff. For an n-period zero coupon bond,

In standard models where Σhm , Σhg , Φmh , Φgh are zero, different timing conventions for the conditional volatility are observationally equivalent. In models with a leverage effect when Σhm , Σhg are not
zero, different timing leads to different models. Our timing is consistent with Omori, Chib, Shephard, and
Nakajima(2007) and the discrete-time stochastic volatility models in the term structure literature; see, e.g.
Bansal and Shaliastovich(2013) and Creal and Wu(2015b).

Our model introduces a novel approach to incorporating volatility factors flexibly in noarbitrage term structure models while keeping bond prices simple through the assumptions
(6) - (8). In most non-Gaussian term structure models, volatility factors enter the variance
of gt under Q and hence bond prices in general. To cancel the volatility factors out of the
pricing equation, unspanned stochastic volatility (USV) models impose restrictions on the Q
parameters that subsequently constrain the cross-sectional fit of the model. In our model, ht
is not priced by construction. Consequently, our model does not impose any restrictions on
the cross section of the yield curve like the restrictions that are imposed in the USV models

11

in Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Jones(2009) and Creal and Wu(2015b). An advantage
of working with discrete time models is that it allows different variance-covariance matrices
under P and Q, while still preserving no arbitrage.4 We will show the no arbitrage condition –
the equivalence of the two probability measures – by deriving the Radon-Nikodym derivative
in Subsection 2.4.
The benefits of our specification are twofold. First, our dynamics for gt under Q and hence
the bond pricing formula are the same as in a Gaussian ATSM. Second, the separation of
the covariance matrices under the two measures allows a more flexible P dynamics, since we
are not limited by the functional forms that achieve analytical bond prices.

2.3

Rotation and identification

In order for the model specified in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 to be identified, we need to impose
restrictions to prevent the latent factors gt and ht from shifting and rotating. The term premium has been a fundamental part in the literature on the term structure of interest rates,
from both the view of policy makers and academic researchers; see, e.g. Wright(2011), Bauer,
Rudebusch, and Wu(2012), Bauer, Rudebusch, and Wu(2014), and Creal and Wu(2015a).
For a better economic interpretation of uncertainty, we propose a rotation new to the liter

In concurrent and independent work, Ghysels, Le, Park, and Zhu(2014) propose a term structure model
where the pricing factors gt have Gaussian VAR dynamics and whose covariance matrices under the P and
Q measures are different. Their covariance matrix under P uses GARCH instead of stochastic volatility.
Stochastic volatility allows us to study the impact of uncertainty shocks, which is the focus of this paper.

(13)

The stochastic discount factor (SDF) Mt+1 incorporates the risk premium and time discounting. In a micro-founded model, this depends on the ratio of marginal utility. For structural
models whose reduced form is an affine term structure model, like the one specified in this
paper; see, e.g. Piazzesi and Schneider(2007) and Creal and Wu(2015a). To complete the
model, we can write down general Q dynamics for the volatility factors pQ (ht+1 |It ; θ). The
SDF is defined as

Mt+1 =

exp (−rt ) pQ (gt+1 |It ; θ) pQ (ht+1 |It ; θ)
p (gt+1 |It ; θ) p (ht+1 |It ; θ)

which makes (7) and (13) consistent. It denotes the information set up to and including
time t, and θ is a vector of parameters. Although we can specify a process for ht+1 under
Q, the parameters are not identified using bond prices alone. For example, if we specify
pQ (ht+1 |It ; θ) = p (ht+1 |It ; θ), then the pricing kernel does not depend on the Q dynamics
of ht+1 :

Mt+1 =

exp (−rt ) pQ (gt+1 |It ; θ)

Bayesian estimation

The ATSM with stochastic volatility is a non-linear, non-Gaussian state space model whose
log-likelihood is not known in closed-form. We estimate the model by Bayesian methods

15

using a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm known as the particle Gibbs
sampler, see Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein(2010) and, for a survey on particle filters, see
Creal(2012). We are the first to introduce this algorithm into the macro-finance literature.
The particle Gibbs sampler uses a particle filter within a standard Gibbs sampling algorithm
to act as a proposal distribution for the latent variables whose full conditional distributions
are intractable. We outline the basic ideas of the MCMC algorithm in this section and
provide full details in Appendix B. Our paper contributes to the econometrics literature
on Bayesian estimation of term structure models and vector autoregressions with stochastic
volatility; see, e.g. Cogley and Sargent(2005), and Primiceri(2005) for VARs and Chib and
Ergashev(2009) and Bauer(2015) for Gaussian affine term structure models. The MCMC
algorithms developed in this paper are efficient and can handle a wide range of VARMA
models with stochastic volatility.

3.1

State space forms
(n)

Stack the yields yt

from (12) in order of increasing maturity for n = n1 , n2 , ..., nN , and

assume that all yields are observed with Gaussian measurement errors:

yt = A + Bgt + ηt ,

ηt ∼ N (0, Ω) ,

(14)

where A = (an1 , . . . , anN )0 and B = (bn1 , ..., bnN )0 . Under the assumption that all yields
are measured with error, both the yield factors g1:T = (g1 , . . . , gT ) and the volatility factors h0:T = (h0 , . . . , hT ) are latent state variables. Let y1:T = (y1 , . . . , yT ) and m1:T =
(m1 , . . . , mT ). Using data augmentation and the particle Gibbs sampler, we draw from the
joint posterior distribution p (g1:T , h0:T , θ|y1:T , m1:T ). The Gibbs sampler iterates between
drawing from the full conditional distributions of the yield factors p (g1:T |y1:T , m1:T , h0:T , θ),
the volatility factors p (h0:T |y1:T , m1:T , g1:T , θ), and the parameters θ. In practice, we use two
different state space representations that either condition on the most recent draw of the

16

yield factors g1:T or the volatility factors h0:T .
State space form I conditional on h0:T

Conditional on the most recent draw of h0:T ,

the model has a linear Gaussian state space form: the state variable gt has a transition
equation in (2), and the observation equations for this state space model combine yields yt
in (14), the macroeconomic variables mt in (1), and the volatility factors ht in (4). Using
this representation, we draw the latent yield factors g1:T in a large block using the Kalman
filter and forward-filtering backward sampling algorithms; see, Durbin and Koopman(2002).
Importantly, most of the parameters that enter the dynamics of gt can be drawn without
conditioning on the state variables g1:T .
State space form II conditional on g1:T

Conditional on the most recent draw of g1:T ,

we have a state space model with observation equations consisting of the macroeconomic
variables and yield factors in (1) and (2) and transition equation for ht in (4). The observation
equations for mt+1 and gt+1 are non-linear in ht . Given that ht enters the conditional mean
of mt+1 and gt+1 , the MCMC algorithms for stochastic volatility models developed by Kim,
Shephard, and Chib(1998) that are widely used in macroeconometrics are not applicable. A
contribution of this paper is developing efficient MCMC algorithms to handle models where
volatility enters the conditional mean. Importantly, the volatility factors h0:T can still be
drawn from their full conditional distribution p (h0:T |y1:T , m1:T , g1:T , θ) in large blocks using
a particle Gibbs sampler, see Appendix B.2.

3.2

MCMC and particle filter

Our MCMC algorithm alternates between the two state space forms. We split the parameters
into blocks θ = (θg0 , θr0 )0 , where we draw θg from the first state space form. We draw the
parameters θr conditional on g1:T and h0:T . Here we sketch the rough steps and leave the
details to Appendix B.

17

1. Conditional on h0:T , write the model as a conditionally, linear Gaussian state space
model.
(a) Draw θg using the Kalman filter without conditioning on g1:T .
(b) Draw g1:T jointly using forward filtering and backward sampling; see, e.g. de Jong
and Shephard(1995), Durbin and Koopman(2002).
2. Conditional on g1:T , the model is a non-linear state space model.
(a) Draw h0:T using the particle filter, see Appendix B for details.
3. Draw any remaining parameters θr conditional on both g1:T and h0:T .
Iterating on these steps produces a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution p (g1:T , h0:T , θ|y1:T , m1:T ).
Another object of interest are the filtered estimates of the state variables and the value of
the log-likelihood function. We calculate these using a particle filter known as the mixture
Kalman filter; see Chen and Liu(2000).6 Similar to our MCMC algorithm, it utilizes the
conditionally linear, Gaussian state space form for statistical efficiency. Intuitively, if the
volatilities h0:T were known, then the Kalman filter would calculate the filtered estimates
of g1:T and the likelihood of the model exactly. In practice, the value of the volatilities
are not known. The mixture Kalman filter calculates a weighted average of Kalman filter
estimates of g1:T where each Kalman filter is run with a different value of the volatilities.
This integrates out the uncertainty associated with the volatilities. The statistical efficiency
gains come from the fact that the Kalman filter integrates out the Gaussian state variables
exactly once we condition on any one path of the volatilities. See Appendix B.3 for details.

The MKF has recently been applied in economics by Creal, Koopman, and Zivot(2010), Creal(2012),
and Shephard(2013).

Economic implications

Key questions of interest are: does uncertainty, specifically uncertainty about monetary policy and its transmission mechanism, have a real effect? And, how do macroeconomic shocks
influence uncertainty? This section investigates these questions using the modeling and estimation tools described in the previous sections. Consistent with the existing literature on
uncertainty, we also find that uncertainty contributes negatively to economic activity and is
associated with higher unemployment. The novelty of our model is that we focus on two aspects of interest rate uncertainty: uncertainty about monetary policy itself, and uncertainty
about the risk premium. This distinction allows us to explore different dimensions of uncertainty of economic interest: (1) monetary policy uncertainty and risk premium uncertainty
react in opposite directions as a consequence of a positive shock to the unemployment rate.
(2) The response of inflation to uncertainty shocks vary across different historical episodes.
To answer these questions, impulse responses to a one time shock are reported in Subsection 4.1. We then aggregate the overall effect with a historical decompositions in Subsection 4.2. The usefulness of two factors in capturing yield volatility is documented in
Section 5.

Data, model and estimates We use the Fama-Bliss zero-coupon yields available from the
Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) with maturities n = (1, 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60)
months. We use consumer price index inflation and the unemployment rate as our macroeconomic variables, which were downloaded from the FRED database at the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis. Inflation is measured as the annual percentage change. The data are
available at a monthly frequency from June 1953 to December 2013.
Our model has G = 3 yield factors which are rotated to be gt =

as

explained in Section 2.3. In the benchmark model, we use H = 4 volatility factors, and
this choice is warranted by the specification analysis in Section 5. The volatility factors
capture the volatility of inflation, unemployment, the short rate rt and the term premium

. We interpret the last two factors as monetary policy uncertainty and term premium

uncertainty. The details for implementation are in Appendix A.2. Posterior means and
standard deviations for the model’s parameters are reported in Table D1.

4.1

Impulse responses

Responses of macroeconomic variables to uncertainty shocks We first study the
real effect of uncertainty shocks by plotting the impulse responses of macroeconomic variables
to one standard deviation uncertainty shocks in Figure 1. We plot the median impulse
responses in solid lines, with the [10%, 90%] highest posterior density intervals calculated
from our MCMC draws in the shaded areas.
First, let us set intuition for how large a one standard deviation uncertainty shock is:
a one standard deviation shock to short rate uncertainty is about 1/11 of the change in
uncertainty leading up to the Great Recession. For term premium uncertainty, the relative
magnitude is 1/12 . For further discussion on scale, time dynamics and the cyclical pattern
of uncertainties, see Subsection 4.3.
Both the uncertainty of monetary policy and term premia have a negative impact on
the real economy: higher uncertainty is associated with higher future unemployment rates.
Both of them are statistically significant given by the [10%, 90%] highest posterior density
intervals, and the sizes are similar as well. The impact of the monetary policy uncertainty
shock peaks at 0.08%, and the effect dies out slowly. This is consistent with findings by
Mumtaz and Zanetti(2013), for example. A higher uncertainty about the term premium, the
component in the long term interest rate that is determined by the market rather than by
the central bank, also leads to an increase of unemployment by as much as 0.08%.
The median impulse response of inflation to uncertainty shocks are close to zero, and
neither of them are statistically significant. This is related to the fact that this relationship
changes over time, including signs. We will explore the time dependence of this relationship
below.

Time-varying (state dependent) impulse response A unique feature of our hybrid
model – jointly capturing the first and second moment effects of uncertainty – is the existence
of time varying or state-dependent impulse responses where both the scale and shape vary
across time.
In a VAR with homoskedastic shocks – where uncertainty only has a first moment effect
and does not enter the conditional volatility, the impulse response to either a one standard
deviation shock or a one unit shock is a constant function through time. In a VAR with
heteroskedastic shocks – where uncertainty only effects the second moment, the impulse
responses to a one unit shock have a different scale that varies through time because of the
stochastic volatility. In either of these cases, the shape of the impulse response remains the
same.
Our model can distinguish important historical episodes like the Great Recession (2007 -

21

2009) from the Great Inflation (1965 - 1982). Neither a standard VAR with homoskedasticity
or with heteroskedasticity has this property. This feature usually only exists in VARs with
time-varying autoregressive coefficients. Our model gets the same benefit without introducing many more state variables as time-varying parameters.
We plot the median impulse response to a one standard deviation shock in Figure 2 for the
following economically significant time periods: the Great Recession in red from December
2007, the Great Inflation in black from 1965, Volcker’s tenure in blue from August 1979, the
Great Moderation in turquoise from 1985, and Greenspan’s conundrum in pink from June
2004. The basic intuition of the time varying impulse response is equivalent to the following
counterfactual analysis: in the moving average representation of the vector autoregression,
(i.e., representing the state of the economy in terms of an accumulation of past shocks),
keep all the shocks the same except for the addition of a one standard deviation shock to a
variable of interest at the beginning of the period we are investigating. See Appendix C for
the calculations.
The responses of the unemployment rate to uncertainty, especially to term premium
uncertainty across different periods in Figure 2, are close to each other and all clearly positive.
This echoes the significant responses in the bottom panels of Figure 1.
In contrast, the variation across different periods for inflation (top row in Figure 2) is
bigger, and the signs also differ across colors. This explains the small magnitude and insignificance in the top row of Figure 1. For example, a shock to monetary policy uncertainty
kept pushing up inflation during the Great Inflation, when inflation was high and associated
with a bad state of the economy. In contrast, the blue line for the Volcker period demonstrated a downward pressure in the medium term. A plausible explanation is that Volcker
is known to combat inflation aggressively. He acted to lower inflation in response to higher
uncertainty in the market. Similarly, the red line also indicates a smaller upward pressure
on inflation during the recent Great Recession, during which inflation was low and agents
worry about deflation rather than hyper inflation. The Great Moderation is consistent with

its reputation and the responses are not extreme. The variability of inflation’s response to
shocks can be explained by its non-cyclical nature; i.e., uncertainty is associated with worse
economic condition but this can mean higher inflation for some periods and lower inflation
for others.
The variation on the top right panel covers both positive and negative regions. The most
positive reaction happened during the period known as Greenspan’s Conundrum, when the
then-chairman raised the benchmark overnight rate but failed to increase the rate with longer
maturities. Researchers attributed this conundrum to variation in the term premium. Relatedly, we find term premium uncertainty had a bigger positive impact on inflation compared
to other periods. The most negative response is during Volcker’s tenure, again consistent
with his reputation as an inflation hawk.

The economic difference also has statistical support. Figure 3 demonstrates the statistical
difference with two examples. On the left side, we plot the response of inflation to a monetary
policy uncertainty shock for the Great Inflation (black) and Volcker regime (blue). Although
the blue line is economically close to and statistically indistinguishable from zero, the black
line is statistically significant. The fact that the credible bands do not overlap one another
for the impulse responses demonstrates a statistical difference across different periods. In the
right panel, we show similar findings with the impulse response of inflation to a term premium
uncertainty shock for the Great Inflation (black) and Greenspan’s conundrum (pink). The
shock during Greenspan’s conundrum (pink) is economically larger than the Great Inflation
shock (black) and is statistically significantly different from zero for part of the response.
The black line itself is not covered by the pink credible band for both the medium term
and the long term. The wide credible bands partially reflect the fact that the time-varying
impulse responses do not average across all the time periods.

Responses of uncertainty to macroeconomic shocks An equally important question
is how do macroeconomic shocks drive uncertainty? The constant impulse responses of
uncertainty to macroeconomic shocks are captured in Figure 4. In response to a standard
deviation shock to inflation, both monetary policy uncertainty and term premium uncertainty
increase. The contemporaneous response is 0.26 standard deviations for the former, and
almost 0.4 for the latter. Then, they die out through time.
Conversely, the two dimensions of uncertainty respond differently to shocks to the unemployment rate: monetary policy uncertainty responds negatively, whereas term premium
uncertainty reacts positively. A higher unemployment rate injects more uncertainty to the
market, hence term premium, the market determined component of interest rates. In contrast, the Fed has historically eased monetary policy when economic conditions worsen. That
explains why we see a lower uncertainty about monetary policy following higher unemploy25

ment rate.

Discussion What drives the difference between the two dimensions of interest rate uncertainty in Figure 2 and Figure 4? The macroeconomic reactions to monetary policy
uncertainty shocks in the left panels of Figure 1 behave similar to those in Mumtaz and
Zanetti(2013). What is the economic interpretation for the term premium shock? Figure 5
shows that price and quantity move in opposite directions after a shock to the term premium. This behaves as if it was a supply shock. The credible bands are at the [16%, 84%]
level rather than [10%, 90%] as in most of our analyses. This reflects the uncertainty of the
decomposition of interest rates into the latent expectation and term premium components.

ical decomposition, a strategy used, for example, by Wu and Xia(2015) to study unconventional monetary policy. A historical decomposition decomposes the historical dynamics of a
variable into contributions of various shocks in the system. In our system, we have shocks
to macroeconomic variables, shocks to yield factors, and shocks to uncertainty.
First, we study the relationship between shocks to monetary policy and term premium
uncertainty on inflation and unemployment. We show them in the top panels of Figure 6.
Throughout the six decades in our sample, the contribution of monetary policy uncertainty to
inflation is overall negative. The biggest impact happened recently since the Great Recession.
Without monetary policy uncertainty, inflation would have been about 0.7% higher at the
end of the sample. The size is substantial, as during this period, the economy is battling
deflationary pressure. On the other hand, the impact of term premium uncertainty on
inflation switched between positive and negative, and the size is small overall.
The upper right panel captures the relationship between an uncertainty shock and the
27

unemployment rate. Overall, uncertainty shocks contributed positively to the unemployment
rate historically, or negatively to the economy, although the importance of monetary policy
uncertainty and term premium uncertainty alternates. For example, the contribution of
monetary policy uncertainty peaked in the early 1980s at about 0.55%. Its contribution
became negative towards the end of the sample, this might imply a lower uncertainty about
monetary policy from better implementation and understanding of unconventional monetary
policy. Or it could come from the mere fact that the short term interest rate is stuck at
zero. In contrast, the contribution of term premium uncertainty was still positive and about
0.2 - 0.3% for the same period. The unemployment rate would have been lower if there
were no uncertainty shocks to the term premium. The average contribution term premium
uncertainty has on the unemployment rate across time is about 0.17%, with three peaks
up to 0.7% in the early 70s, early 80s and mid 2000s. The last one is associated with
Greenspan’s Conundrum. This was often attributed to an increase in term premia, which is
consistent with our empirical evidence that higher term premium uncertainty drove higher
unemployment rate.
Second, we now focus on how macroeconomic variables drive uncertainty. Inflation imposes a positive contribution to both uncertainty measures, especially during the early 1980s,
when inflation was at its peak. During lower inflation periods early and late in the sample,
its contribution became negative. These findings are consistent with the impulse responses in
the top panels of Figure 4. Shocks to the unemployment rate contribute mostly negatively to
monetary policy uncertainty, especially for the prolonged periods in the 1990s to mid 2000s
and after the Great Recession. In contrast, its contribution to term premium uncertainty
was more positive than negative. The two red lines in the bottom panels often move in
opposite directions, with a correlation as high as -0.88. This contrast again is consistent
with Figure 4, and is a further evidence supporting two dimensions of uncertainty.

Estimates of uncertainty

We plot the monetary policy and term premium uncertainty factors in the left panel of
Figure 7, together with the uncertainty factors of macroeconomic variables on the right.
Both interest rate uncertainties increased in the first half of the sample, and peaked during
the two recessions in the early 1980s. The short rate uncertainty displayed a decreasing
trend since, although it increased again right before the two recessions in the 2000s. It finally
settled down at its lowest at the end of the sample. Whereas the term premium uncertainty
remained relatively stable for the second half of the sample. Inflation uncertainty was around
average at the beginning of the sample, then it peaked twice at the second recession in the
1970s and two recessions in early 1980s. Then it kept going down until late 1990s. Since
then, it went up, and peaked in the Great Recession at historical high before dropping to
average.

Magnitude of uncertainty The left panel of Figure 7 provides a visual inspection of the
magnitude of a one standard deviation shock as discussed in Subsection 4.1. One standard
29

deviation of the short rate uncertainty shock is about 0.3. The change in uncertainty leading
up to the Great Recession is about 3.4 (11 times the shock size), and the change is about
4.5 before the 1980 recession (15 standard deviations). One standard deviation for the term
premium uncertainty shock is about 0.14. Its hike before the Great Recession is about 12
times this magnitude, comparable to the movement for the short rate uncertainty relative
to its respective standard deviation.

Uncertainty and recession Although the four uncertainty measures have their own dynamics, Figure 7 shows that all of them are counter-cyclical: they increase drastically before
almost every recession and remain high throughout recessions; when the economy recovers,
they all drop.
To illustrate this statistically, we use the following simple regression:

hjt = α + β1recession,t + ujt ,

(15)

where 1recession,t is a recession dummy, and takes a value of 1 if time t is dated within a
recession by the NBER. The coefficients are 2.0 for monetary policy uncertainty meaning
that uncertainty is 2.0 units higher during recessions as opposed to expansions, and the
difference is 0.4 for term premium uncertainty, 0.7 for both inflation and unemployment
uncertainty. All coefficients are statistically significant with p-values numerically at zero.

Model comparison
Model specifications

Identification and other model restrictions In addition to the rotation restrictions
imposed in Proposition 1, we impose further restrictions to achieve identification: (i) Σm ,
Σg , Σh are lower triangular; (ii) Γ1 is a (G + M ) × H matrix with H rows corresponding to

30

ht having a scaled identity matrix 1200 ∗ IH .7 (iii) when H > 0, the diagonal elements of
Σm and Σg are fixed at 1; (iv) We set H elements corresponding to ht in Γ0 to zero.
We restrict the covariance matrix under Q to be equal to the long-run mean under P;
 Γ0 +Γ1 µ̄h 
. This restriction implies that our model nests Gaussian
i.e. ΣQ
g = Σg diag exp
2
ATSMs as Σh → 0. Finally, we estimate Ω in (14) to be a diagonal matrix. A demonstration
of implementing the benchmark model is in Appendix A.2.

Models To understand the factor structure in volatility, on top of the macro model studied
in Section 4, we compare yield only models with M = 0 and H = 0, 1, 2, 3 volatility factors.
We label these models HH . Yields in the H1 model share one common volatility factor. Our
choice of Γ1 implies that the volatility factors in the H2 model capture the short rate and
term premium volatilities. The H3 model adds another degree of freedom for the expected
future short rate volatility.

Estimates Estimates of the posterior mean and standard deviation for the parameters of
all four yields only models as well as the log-likelihood and BIC (evaluated at the posterior
mean) are reported in Table D2. Priors for all parameters of the model are discussed in
Appendix B.4. The parameter estimates for the H0 model are typical of those found in
the literature on Gaussian ATSMs, see Hamilton and Wu(2012). We also note that with
the introduction of stochastic volatility the estimated values of the autoregressive matrix Φg
become more persistent. The modulus of the eigenvalues of this matrix are larger for all the
stochastic volatility models. Due to the increased persistence, the long-run mean parameters
µ̄g of the yield factors are larger than for the H0 model and closer to the unconditional sample
mean of yields.

With one yield volatility factor, we normalize it to be the volatility of rt . With two yield volatility
(n∗ )
factors, we normalize them to be the volatility of rt and tpt . With three yield volatility factors, Γ1 is the
scaled identity matrix.

Yield volatilities

Yield only models We first compare yield only models HH in terms of fitting the yield
volatility, and select the number of volatility factors needed to describe the data. Table D2
shows that the introduction of the first stochastic volatility factor causes an enormous increase in the log-likelihood from 37425.4 for the H0 model to 37993.9 for the H1 model.
The addition of a second volatility factor that captures movements in the 5 yr term premium adds another 100 points to the likelihood of the H2 model to 38095.9. Adding a third
volatility factor increases the likelihood by less than 20 points to 38104.7. As the number of
volatility factors increases, the number of parameters also increases. The BIC penalizes the
log-likelihood for these added parameters. It selects the H2 model with two volatility factors
as the best model for its overall fit.
32

In Figure 8, we compare the estimated volatilities from the three yields only models with
a reduced form description of the data. The top left panel plots the conditional volatility
of the 3, 12, and 60 month yields from the generalized autoregressive score volatility model
from Creal, Koopman, and Lucas(2011) and Creal, Koopman, and Lucas(2013) to capture
this feature of the data.8 This graph illustrates a factor structure for yield volatilities of
different maturities. At the same time, they have distinct behavior across time. In the first
half of the sample, the term structure of yield volatilities sloped downward as the volatility
of short-term interest rates was higher than long-term rates. Short term rates became less
volatile than long-term rates after the early 1980’s and the term structure of volatility sloped
upward on average. This may reflect efforts by the monetary authorities to make policy more
transparent and better anchor agents’ expectations. In the mid-2000s, the volatility of long
and short rates moved in opposite directions with long-term volatility increasing at the same
time that short-term volatility is declining.
The remaining panels in Figure 8 plot the (filtered) conditional volatility from the
ATSM’s. In the H1 model, movements in yield volatility are nearly perfectly correlated.
With only one factor, the model is not flexible enough to capture the idiosyncratic movements across different maturities that are observed in the data. This is consistent with the
findings in Creal and Wu(2015b). The H2 model adds flexibility through a second factor
that drives the difference in volatility between the short-term and long-term yields. This
model captures all the key features in the data we describe above. Although adding a third
volatility factor provides more flexibility, the key economically meaningful movements are
already captured by the first and second factors. In the H2 model, the correlation between
the two volatility factors is only 0.082. The H3 model adds a third volatility factor which
is highly correlated with the short rate volatility factor at 0.90. Overall, both economic and
statistical evidence points to two volatility factors.
8

For each maturity n, we estimate an AR(1) model for the conditional mean of yields and the Student’s
t generalized autoregressive score (GAS) model of Creal, Koopman, and Lucas(2011) and Creal, Koopman,
and Lucas(2013) for the conditional volatility.

Macro model Our benchmark macro model studied in Section 4 adds two macro variables
– inflation and the unemployment rate – and their volatilities into the H2 model selected
above. The conditional volatilities from this model are plotted in the bottom right panel of
Figure 8. The estimated conditional volatilities from the macro model are nearly identical
to the estimates from the yields-only H2 model and capture all the characteristics of yield
volatility discussed above. Overall, our benchmark macro model fits the yield volatility
similarly to the preferred yield only model.

5.3

Cross-sectional fit of the yield curve

Our term structure models are designed to capture the volatility of yields while not sacrificing
their ability to fit the cross section of the yield curve. In fact, we find that by introducing
stochastic volatility it improves their ability to fit the yield curve at the same time. In
Table 1, we report the average pricing errors across the seven maturities for the Gaussian
H0 model in the first column. The next four columns report the ratios of pricing errors for
the yields-only models with H = 1, 2, 3 and the macroeconomic model relative to the H0
model for the same maturity. Relative to the Gaussian H0 model, the biggest improvement
happens for the 3 month yield, with measurement error dropping about half across models.
For other maturities, the fit improves more often than not. Unlike the standard USV model

which imposes restrictions on the cross-section of yields, our new models actually improve
it.

5.4

Term premium

The estimated term premium is one of the key aspects of our paper. It is fundamentally
latent and unobservable. This section compares our estimate with what is studied in the
literature as external validation. Many estimates of the term premium take a much shorter
sample, see Wright(2011), Bauer, Rudebusch, and Wu(2012) and Bauer, Rudebusch, and
Wu(2014) for examples. To compare across a long time horizon like ours, we take Adrian,
Crump, and Moench(2013)’s estimate, which is publicly available from the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. We plot the estimate from our benchmark model (red solid line) with the
term premium of Adrian, Crump, and Moench(2013) (blue dashed line) in Figure 9. They
mimic each other sharing the same qualitative and quantitative features. Both estimates

35

of the term premium have a common business cycle pattern. The correlation between the
two series is surprisingly high at 0.9, given the considerable uncertainty associated with the
decomposition. The term premium is a sizable component of interest rates, and it peaks at
4% in the 1980s.

Conclusion

We developed a new macro finance affine term structure model with stochastic volatilities
to study the empirical importance of interest rate uncertainty. In our model, the volatility
factor serves two roles: it is the volatility of the yield curve and macroeconomic variables,
and it also measures uncertainty which directly interacts with macroeconomic variables in
a VAR. Our model allows multiple volatility factors, which are determined separately from
the yield factors. With two volatility factors and three traditional yield factors, our model
can capture both aspects of the data.
We find that uncertainty contributes negatively to the real economy, which is consistent
with what researchers find in the uncertainty literature. Unique conclusions drawn from our
two dimensions of uncertainty (monetary policy uncertainty and term premium uncertainty)
include: (1) they react in opposite directions as a consequence of a positive shock to the
unemployment rate. (2) The response of inflation to uncertainty shocks vary across different
historical episodes.

Q
where λ̃i and λ̃Q
i are the diagonal elements of Λ̃ and Λ̃g . Given a matrix, its eigenvectors are identified up

to their scale. Therefore, each column of Q requires one restriction for identification. We set the diagonal
Q
elements qii = 1. The normalization assumption for QQ
g is q1i = 1, which then facilitates us to impose

restrictions directly on ΦQ
g for actual implementation below. There are no free parameters in the 4th row of
Q and the second row of QQ
g due to Proposition 1. Finally, we note that the eigenvectors in the bottom left
H × (M + G) block of Q are all equal to zero due to the assumption that the level of mt and gt do not enter
the conditional mean of ht+1 in (4).
We allow for a factor structure in the volatility in (3) through the vector Γ0 and matrix Γ1 . In our
benchmark model, we set

Appendix B.1

MCMC and particle filtering algorithms
MCMC algorithm

In the appendix, we use the notation xt:t+k = (xt , . . . , xt+k ) to denote a sequence of variables from time
t to time t + k. Our Gibbs sampling algorithm iterates between three basic steps: (i) drawing the latent
yield factors g1:T conditional on the volatilities h0:T and parameters θ; (ii) drawing the volatilities h0:T
conditional on g1:T and θ; (iii) and then drawing the parameters of the model θ. The MCMC algorithm is
designed to minimize the amount that we condition on the latent variables g1:T by using the Kalman filter
to marginalize over them. And, it draws the latent variables h0:T in large blocks using the particle Gibbs
sampler, see Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein(2010). We will use two different state space representations
as described in Subsection 3.1.

Appendix B.1.1

State space form conditional on h0:T

For linear, Gaussian models, we use the following state space form

Yt
xt+1

= Zt xt + dt + ηt∗

ηt∗ ∼ N (0, Ht ) ,

(B.1)

= Tt xt + ct + Rt ε∗t+1

ε∗t+1 ∼ N (0, Ct ) ,

Q
with x1 ∼ N (x1 , P1 ). The intercept A in (14) is a linear function of µ̄Q
g . We write it as A = A0 + A1 × µ̄g
Q
Q Q,u
Q,u
where µ̄Q
is the vector of unrestricted parameters. The vector M0Q and matrix
g = M0 + M1 µ̄g , and µ̄g

M1Q are discussed in Appendix A.2. The vector A0 and matrix A1 are determined by the bond loading
recursions.
We place the unconditional means of the macro variables µ̄m , the unconditional means of the yield
factors µ̄ug , and the unconditional mean of the yield factors under Q given by µ̄Q,u
in the state vector.
g

Note that µ̄uf = µ̄0m , µ̄u,0
. We draw them jointly with the yield factors ḡ1:T using simulation smoothing
g
algorithms (forward-filtering backward sampling). We also marginalize over these parameters when drawing
other parameters of the model. We fit the model into the state space form (B.1) and (B.2) by defining the
state space matrices as

Appendix B.2

Drawing the volatilities by particle Gibbs sampling

The full conditional distribution of the volatilities p (h0:T |g1:T , m1:T ; θ) is a non-standard distribution. We
use a particle Gibbs sampler to draw paths of the state from this distribution in large blocks, which improves
the mixing of the Markov chain. The particle Gibbs sampler runs a particle filter at each iteration of the
MCMC algorithm to build a discrete approximation of the continuous distribution p (h0:T |g1:T , m1:T ; θ). At
each date t, the marginal filtering distribution of the state variable is p (ht |g1:T , m1:T ; θ). The particle filter

(j)
t = 1, ..., T , the particle filter approximates the joint distribution h0:T , ŵ0:T
≈ p (h0:T |g1:T , m1:T ; θ).
j=1

The PG sampler draws one path of the state variables from this discrete approximation. As the number of
particles M goes to infinity, the PG sampler draws from the exact full conditional distribution.
The particle Gibbs sampler requires a small modification of a standard particle filter. The particle Gibbs


(∗)
(∗)
(∗)
sampler requires that the pre-existing path h0:T = h0 , h1 , . . . , hT that was sampled at the last iteration
(∗)

have positive probability of being sampled again. This means that the path h0:T must survive the resampling
step of the particle filtering algorithm. Instead of implementing a standard resampling algorithm, Andrieu,
Doucet, and Holenstein(2010) describe a conditional resampling algorithm that needs to be implemented.
Other than this, the particle filter is standard and proceeds as follows.
At time t = 0.

The algorithm produces a draw h0:T = h0 , . . . , hT
from the full conditional distribution.
In practice, when the dimension of H is large, we draw an individual path of the volatilities conditional
on the other paths. Let hi,t for i = 1, . . . , H denote the set of stochastic volatility state variables. Specifically,
we draw path hi,0:T conditional on the remaining paths hk,0:T for all k 6= i. This remains a valid particle
Gibbs sampler. In the paper, we use J = 300 particles and choose the transition density p(ht |ht−1 ; θ) as the
proposal q (ht |mt , gt , ht−1 ; θ).

Appendix B.2.1

The IMH algorithm

In our MCMC algorithm, we draw as many parameters as possible without conditioning on the state variables and other parameters. In the algorithm in Appendix B.2.2, we will repeatedly apply the independence
Metropolis Hastings (IMH) algorithm along the lines of Chib and Greenberg(1994) and Chib and Erga0

shev(2009), in a combination with the Kalman filter. Here is how it works. Let Yt = (m0t yt0 h0t ) . Suppose
we separate the parameter vector θ = (ψ, ψ − ) and we want to draw a subset of the parameters ψ conditional
on the remaining parameters ψ − .
• Maximize the log-posterior p (ψ|Y1:T , ψ − ) ∝ p (Y1:T |ψ, ψ − ) p (ψ), where the likelihood is computed
using the Kalman filter. Let ψ̂ be the posterior mode and Hψ−1 be the inverse Hessian at the mode.

MCMC algorithm

We use the notation θ(−) to denote all the remaining parameters in θ other than the parameters being drawn
Q
in that step. Let qf and φQ
g denote the free parameters in the matrix of eigenvectors Q and Φg , respectively.

Our MCMC algorithm proceeds as follows:

53

1. Draw λf , qf , qgQ , Σg : Conditional on h0:T and the remaining parameters of the model, write the model
in state space form as in Appendix B.1.1. Draw parameters listed below using the IMH algorithm as
explained in Appendix B.2.1.
• Draw the elements of Ω. For any diagonal elements in Ω, we use a proposal distribution that
draws them in logarithms.
• Draw the free parameters in Σg : note the diagonal elements of Σg are fixed.

Appendix B.2.
4. Draw (Σm , Σgm , Σhm , Σhg , Σh ): Conditional on g1:T and h0:T , the full conditional distribution for
these parameters are known in closed form. The matrices Σgm , Σhm , Σhg can be drawn recursively
from the regression models (B.4) and (B.5) once we treat the errors εmt and εgt as observable. The
full conditional distribution of the matrix Σh Σ0h is an inverse Wishart distribution.

Appendix B.3

Particle filter for the log-likelihood and filtered estimates of state variables

The particle filter of Appendix B.2 assumes we observe the yield factors g1:T . To calculate the likelihood of
the model, we must integrate over both g1:T and h0:T simultaneously. The particle filter we implement for
this purpose is the mixture Kalman filter of Chen and Liu(2000).
9

Note that in a standard vector autoregression with stochastic volatility that does not require rotating
0
the yield state vector as gt = (rt ert tpt ) , the matrix of autoregressive parameters Φ can be drawn using
Gibbs sampling as in a standard Bayesian VAR; see, e.g. Del Negro and Schorfheide(2011).

State space form

In order to implement the particle filter, it is easier to write the model in terms of the marginal dynamics

of ht and the dynamics of the conditionally Gaussian state variables xt = (m0t gt0 ) . In this sub-section,
0

we write Yt = (m0t , yt0 ) . Using properties of the multivariate normal distribution, the marginal distribution

Appendix B.3.2

Mixture Kalman filter

Let xt|t−1 denote the conditional mean and Pt|t−1 the conditional covariance matrix of the one-step ahead
predictive distribution p(xt |Y1:t−1 , h0:t−1 ; θ) of a conditionally linear, Gaussian state space model. Similarly,

55

let xt|t denote the conditional mean and Pt|t the conditional covariance matrix of the filtering distribution
p(xt |Y1:t , h0:t ; θ). Conditional on the volatilities h0:T , these quantities can be calculated by the Kalman filter.
Let Nmn = M + N denote the dimension of the observation vector Yt and J the number of particles.
Within the particle filter, we use the residual resampling algorithm of Liu and Chen(1998). The particle
filter then proceeds as follows:

Appendix B.4

Prior distributions

We use proper priors for all parameters of the model. Throughout this discussion, a normal distribution
is defined as x ∼ N (µx , Vx ), where µx is the mean and Vx is the covariance matrix. The inverse Wishart
distribution X ∼ InvWishart (ν, S) is defined for a random k × k matrix X such that E [X] =

S
ν−k−1 .

Recall

that we have divided all observed variables by 1200 and this is reflected in the scale of the hyperparameters.
Let ιk denote a k × 1 vector of ones.
• The matrix ΦQ
g has a total of 6 free parameters, see Appendix A.2
Q

– We set the 3 ordered eigenvalues as λQ
g,1 ∼ N (0.99, 0.0001), λg,2 ∼ N (0.95, 0.0010), λg,3 ∼

• The matrix Φf is decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, see Appendix A.2.
– The matrix has 9 eigenvalues. The first M + G = 5 must be ordered and the second H = 4 must
be ordered. We use conditional beta distributions which guarantee an ordering. For the macro
and yield factors: λf,1 ∼ beta (600, 5), λf,2 /λf,1 ∼ beta (600, 5), λf,3 /λf,2 ∼ beta (300, 5),
λf,4 /λf,3 ∼ beta (50, 4), λf,5 /λf,4 ∼ beta (50, 4).

And, for the volatility factors: λf,6 ∼

beta (500, 3.5), λf,7 /λf,6 ∼ beta (500, 3.5), λf,8 /λf,7 ∼ beta (500, 3.5), λf,9 /λf,8 ∼ beta (500, 3.5)
– The free eigenvectors qij are qij ∼ N (0, 6000).
