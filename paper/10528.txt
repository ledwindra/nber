ABSTRACT
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) broadly prohibits discrimination on the basis
of disability in employment and other settings. Several empirical studies have suggested that
employment levels of individuals with disabilities declined rather than increased after the ADA's
passage. This paper provides a first look at whether lower disabled employment levels after the
ADA might have resulted from increased participation in educational opportunities by individuals
with disabilities as a rational response to the ADA's employment protections. The main empirical
finding is that individuals with disabilities who were not employed in the years following legal
innovation in the form of the ADA were more likely than their pre-ADA counterparts to give
educational participation as their reason for not being employed. This preliminary evidence suggests
the value of further study, with better education data, of the relationship between the ADA's
enactment and disabled participation in educational opportunities.

Identifying the Effects of the Americans with Disabilities Act Using State-Law Variation:
Preliminary Evidence on Educational Participation Effects
Christine Jolls∗
Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) with an unusual
degree of political consensus and popular support. The ADA broadly prohibits discrimination on
the basis of disability in employment and other settings. Given the breadth of the political
support for the ADA, it was quite unexpected to find early evidence that the law actually
worsened rather than improved employment prospects for individuals with disabilities (A.M.
Gamboa 1995).
Subsequent papers have closely examined the question of the employment effects of the
ADA, reaching varying conclusions. Thomas DeLeire (2000) and Daron Acemoglu and Joshua
Angrist (2001) – some of the earliest papers in what has become a substantial literature – offer
significant evidence of disabled employment declines resulting from the ADA’s enactment.
Other authors, however, have questioned whether the decline in disabled employment in the
years following the ADA’s enactment is actually a consequence of the law or whether instead the
decline resulted from other contemporaneous factors such as changes in federal disability
benefits levels or changes in health status (e.g., John Bound and Timothy Waidmann 2000;
Douglas Kruse and Lisa Schur 2003).
Variation in state-level employment discrimination regimes for individuals with
disabilities in the period before the ADA’s enactment provides a helpful means of cutting
through the existing thicket and identifying more credibly the effects of the ADA on outcomes –
in terms of both employment and (my focus here) educational participation – for individuals with
disabilities. Prior to the ADA’s enactment, some states had employment discrimination regimes
that closely mirrored the ADA in both requiring employers to avoid disability-based

1

discrimination in hiring, firing, and terms and conditions of employment and requiring
employers to provide “reasonable accommodations” – such as assistive technology or changes in
workplace structures – to individuals with disabilities (see Table 1, column 1). Another group of
states tracked the ADA in prohibiting disability-based discrimination in hiring, firing, and terms
and conditions of employment, but did not require reasonable accommodations (Table 1,
columns 2 and 3). A third group imposed no limits whatever on the treatment of disabled
employees in the pre-ADA period (Table 1, column 3). With respect to the ADA’s employment
effects, this state-law variation permits inquiry into the relationship between the impact of the
ADA’s employment discrimination provisions on disabled employment and the degree to which
these provisions were actually a legal innovation in a given state. If disabled employment effects
are significantly correlated with the degree to which the employment discrimination provisions
of the ADA were an innovation in a given state, then non-ADA changes around the time of the
ADA’s passage – such as changes federal disability benefits or health status – may not be the
best explanations for declining disabled employment after the ADA.1
In fact the degree to which the ADA’s employment discrimination provisions were an
innovation relative to pre-ADA state law is closely connected to the degree to which disabled
employment declined just after the ADA’s passage (Christine Jolls and J.J. Prescott 2004). In
particular, while relative disabled employment declined significantly just after the ADA’s
enactment in states in which these provisions were a substantial innovation relative to the preADA state-level employment discrimination regime, relative disabled employment was stable in
states with ADA-like employment discrimination regimes in place prior to the ADA’s
enactment. The innovation-related employment declines identified by the state-law variation,
however, were concentrated in the initial years after the ADA’s enactment. This finding about

2

the timing of the ADA’s employment effects suggests the empirical plausibility of the potential
explanation offered by Jolls (2000:280) for disabled employment declines after the ADA:
disabled individuals in states in which the ADA’s employment discrimination provisions were a
substantial innovation relative to pre-ADA state law may have temporarily reduced their labor
supply because these provisions, by raising the returns to education for individuals with
disabilities in those states, encouraged such individuals to invest in education.
This paper provides preliminary evidence on the possibility that the ADA increased
participation in educational opportunities by individuals with disabilities in states in which the
ADA’s employment discrimination provisions were a substantial innovation compared to states
in which they were not. As in the context of the ADA’s employment effects, examining the
ADA’s impact on disabled educational participation against the backdrop of states with
preexisting ADA-like employment discrimination regimes helps to control for general changes in
incentives for disabled educational participation that may have occurred contemporaneously with
the ADA’s enactment. A limited review of evidence from the Current Population Survey (CPS)
provides qualified support for the idea that movement in disabled educational participation after
the ADA’s enactment was positively correlated with the degree to which the ADA’s employment
discrimination provisions were a substantial innovation relative to pre-ADA state law.
I.

Educational Investment and the Labor Market
In a conventional labor market in which the typical worker is demanded and paid in

accordance with the worker’s marginal revenue product of labor, taste-based discrimination
against a group of workers – such as individuals with disabilities – reduces this group’s wage
below the group’s marginal revenue product of labor and also depresses the group’s employment
level (John Donohue 1986:1415-1418).2 Empirically, Marjorie Baldwin and William Johnson

3

(1994) offer evidence of large discrimination-induced wage and employment gaps between
disabled and nondisabled workers. Within this framework, the effect of an employment
discrimination law such as the ADA – assuming the law is fully enforceable – is to align the
wages and employment levels of the disadvantaged group with those of the advantaged group
(see Jolls 2000:243-51; Jolls 2001:693-94).
The implications of this analysis for disabled workers’ educational decisions are fairly
straightforward. Human capital theory suggests that decisions about educational investment are
likely to be driven at least in part by the labor market returns to such investment. Because
employment discrimination law in the above analysis increases both the wages and the
employment levels of disadvantaged workers, it increases the returns to educational investment
by this group. Thus, the enactment of an employment discrimination law should increase
educational participation by members of the disadvantaged group. In the context of the ADA,
the new regime should increase educational participation by individuals with disabilities in the
states in which the ADA’s employment discrimination provisions were an innovation compared
to states in which they were not.
II.

Data
As is true in many areas of legal regulation (e.g., David Autor, John Donohue and

Stewart Schwab 2003), state-level employment discrimination regimes for individuals with
disabilities in the pre-ADA period consisted of a mix of statutory and judicial law. Judicial
opinions turn out to be an important source in understanding the pre-ADA state-level
employment discrimination regimes because a number of states imposed obligations by judicial
decision rather than by statutory provision, and because in some cases judicial opinions
substantially clarified the meaning of an ambiguous statutory framework. The state groupings

4

used in this paper reflect not only statutory law but also all pre-ADA case law available in the
Westlaw legal database. I refer to states in which the pre-ADA state-level regime mirrored the
ADA’s employment discrimination provisions (column 1 of Table 1) as the “control” states; to
states in which the pre-ADA state-level regime contained more limited regulation of the
treatment of disabled employees (columns 2 and 3 of Table 1) as the “limited protection” states;
and to states in which the pre-ADA state-level regime imposed no limits whatever on the
treatment of disabled employees (column 4 of Table 1) as the “no protection” states.
For the disability status of individuals as well as most other demographic and economic
variables used below, I rely on the March CPS.3 The dependent variable of interest in the
present work is participation in educational opportunities. I measure educational participation
using responses to the CPS question about whether the reason a respondent was not working in
the observation year was the pursuit of educational opportunities.4 Although there are various
other educational participation questions in the CPS, this question seems best suited for
examining the hypothesis that ADA-driven innovation relative to pre-ADA state-level
employment discrimination law produced a short-run decline in disabled employment because of
the positive effect of such innovation on disabled educational investment incentives.
III.

Disabled Educational Participation Before and After the ADA
Table 2 presents basic statistics on the mean proportion of individuals who give

educational participation as the reason for not being employed for disabled versus nondisabled
individuals, before and after the ADA, across the three state groups from Table 1. While
common practice in examining the effects of a changed legal regime is to examine two-year
windows before and after the change (e.g., Jonathan Gruber 1994; Autor, Donohue and Schwab
2002), the fact that there are only three states in one of the state groups here – the no-protection

5

group – means that the number of individuals who both identify as disabled in the CPS and give
educational participation as their reason for not being employed in any given year is often
extremely small (less than five) in this state group. Thus, sensible examination of the ADA’s
effects across the three state groups required the use of longer time windows. The empirical
analysis uses data from 1987, the first observation year for which disability status is available in
the CPS, through 1997, five years after the first year in which the ADA was in effect.
While the ADA went into effect in 1992, it was passed in June of 1990, and from the
perspective of examining educational investment prompted by ADA-driven innovation in the
legal treatment of employment discrimination the relevant “start date” is the date on which the
ADA would have been viewed as a reliable basis on which to make decisions about education.
Therefore, Table 2 treats the period from 1987 through 1990 as the pre-ADA period and the
period from 1991 to 1997 as the post-ADA period.
The top two rows in Table 2 show the effect of the ADA’s enactment on disabled
individuals in both the limited-protection state group, in which the ADA’s employment
discrimination provisions were an innovation relative to pre-ADA state law, and the control state
group, in which they were not. The probability of a disabled individual giving educational
participation as the reason for not being employed declined in the first state group relative to the
second (a state-time difference of -.0039), but, as Table 2 shows, a similar pattern held for
nondisabled individuals, leaving no significant relative effect of ADA-driven innovation on the
educational participation of individuals with disabilities. Looking still further down Table 2 to
the comparison of the no-protection state group and the control group, however, a different
pattern appears. Educational participation of individuals with disabilities increased with the
ADA’s enactment in the no-protection group – where the ADA’s employment discrimination

6

provisions were the most significant innovation – relative to the control group; by contrast, for
the nondisabled, educational participation declined with the ADA’s enactment in the noprotection group relative to the control group. On balance, then, the simple mean probabilities
point to an increase in relative disabled educational participation with the ADA’s enactment in
no-protection states compared to control states.
Table 3 moves to a regression framework, employing the straightforward difference-indifference-in-difference (DDD) specification in equation (1) below, where Y denotes whether an
individual was not employed because of participation in educational opportunities; i indexes
individuals, j indexes states, and t indexes years; X denotes a vector of demographic and
state-level economic characteristics; ADA denotes a dummy variable equal to 1 in the post-ADA
period, DIS denotes a dummy variable equal to 1 for individuals with disabilities, LP
denotes a dummy variable equal to 1 for states in the limited protection group; and NP denotes a
dummy variable equal to 1 for states in the no-protection group:
Yijt = β0 + β1Xijt + β2ADAt + β3DISi + β4LPj
+ β5NPj + β6(ADAt x DISi) + β7(ADAt x LPj)
+ β8(ADAt x NPj) + β9(DISi x LPj)
+ β10(DISi x NPj) + β11(ADAt x DISi x LPj)
+ β12(ADAt x DISi x NPj)

5

(1)

The coefficients of interest in equation (1) are the coefficients on the triple interaction terms,
ADAt x DISi x LPj and ADAt x DISi x NPj. These coefficients measure the change between the
pre- and post-ADA periods in disabled versus nondisabled educational participation in limitedprotection and no-protection states, respectively, compared to control states.
The results in Table 3, which reflect a variety of timing assumptions, are consistent with
the preliminary findings in Table 2. As the top panel of Table 3 shows, the ADA’s enactment
had no significant effect on disabled educational participation in the limited-protection states

7

compared to the control states, but it had a positive effect on disabled educational participation in
the no-protection states compared to the control states.6 In terms of magnitude, the estimated
marginal effect of the ADA’s enactment on disabled educational participation in no-protection
states compared to control states is 0.025 in column 1, 0.024 in column 2, 0.011 in column 3, and
0.013 in column 4; these estimates reflect at least a doubling of the pre-ADA probability of
disabled educational participation in no-protection states reported in Table 2 (0.0098).
An important concern with the results reported up until now is that the no-protection
group, in which I estimate that the enactment of the ADA had a significant positive effect on
relative disabled educational participation compared to the control group, consists of only three
states, all of which are from the South (Table 1, column 4). With respect to the small size of the
group, the basic concern is that a large increase in disabled educational investment in one state –
generated by some state-specific effect rather than by ADA-driven innovation – could be
masking declines in disabled educational investment in the other states, which of course would
make a causal link to the ADA unlikely. Figure 1 below shows, however, that relative disabled
educational investment followed an upward pattern in all three of the states in the no-protection
group, compared to the trend in the control group.
A remaining concern with the results for the no-protection group stems from the lack of
geographic diversity within that group. The problem arises from the possibility that an
unobserved shock in the southern region of the country between the pre- and post-ADA periods
might, if it differentially affected disabled and nondisabled individuals, be driving the apparent
effect of the ADA’s enactment on disabled educational participation in the no-protection group.
A straightforward strategy to alleviate this concern about a possible “southern trend” is simply to

8

re-estimate equation (1) on just the southern states from each of the three state groups. Results,
reported in the bottom panel of Table 3, are consistent with the pattern described above.
IV.

Conclusion
This paper offers preliminary evidence that disabled educational participation responded

positively to the ADA’s enactment in states with no pre-ADA restrictions on disability-based
discrimination in employment. Intuitively, even if – as the results here suggest – disabled
individuals do not alter their educational participation in response to changes in the specific
nature of the employment protections afforded to them, they may respond to the more obvious
switch from no protection to the employment discrimination provisions of the ADA. However,
given the data limitations in the CPS, at most the empirical results presented here provide very
preliminary evidence suggesting the value of further study, with better education data, of the
relationship between the ADA’s enactment and disabled educational participation. Such further
study should also account for possible ADA-related changes in the quality or quantity of
educational opportunities available to individuals with disabilities.

Notes: Each bar represents the means-based DDD
estimate of the ADA’s effect on relative disabled
educational participation in the named state. The
means-based DDD estimate for a given state is
computed by subtracting the post-ADA change in
nondisabled educational participation in that state
from the post-ADA change in disabled educational
participation in the state; and then by subtracting
from the resulting figure the comparable difference
for the control state group. The difference for the
control state group, using the figures in Table 2, is
.0034–.0053 = -.0019.

Notes: Control states are states with pre-ADA
employment discrimination regimes that both
required employers to avoid disability-based
discrimination in hiring, firing, and terms and
conditions of employment and required employers to
provide reasonable accommodations to individuals
with disabilities. Limited-protection states are states
with pre-ADA employment discrimination regimes
that prohibited disability-based discrimination in
hiring, firing, and terms and conditions of
employment but did not require reasonable
accommodations. No-protection states are states that
imposed no limits whatever on the treatment of
disabled employees in the pre-ADA period. For
further details on the pre-ADA state-level regimes,
see Jolls and Prescott (2004).

For changes in federal disability benefits or health status to explain such a pattern of

employment declines, these changes would have to be correlated with pre-ADA state-level
employment discrimination regimes, which seems unlikely.
2

In some markets, workers may receive an “efficiency wage” rather than a wage equal to the

marginal revenue product of labor, and the effects of employment discrimination law require
separate analysis in such settings.

For state receipts of disability benefits and state unemployment rates I rely on the data series

generously provided by David Autor and Mark Duggan. For an extensive discussion of various
issues related to the use of the CPS disability measure, including the possibility that the ADA’s
enactment could have altered the shape or size of the group responding “yes” to the CPS
disability question, see Jolls and Prescott (2004).

Other choices in response to this question are retirement, inability to find work, family

obligations, illness/disability, and “other”.

In specifications with state and year fixed effects, ADAt, LPj, and NPj are omitted.

Both Table 2 and Table 3 use data on all respondents, not just those who are not employed.

Limiting the sample to just those who are not employed does not alter the basic pattern of results
reported in Table 3, although it modestly reduces the precision of the estimates.
