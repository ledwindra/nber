    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a dynamic contracting theory of asset- and cash flow-based financing that demonstrates how firm, intermediary, and capital market characteristics jointly shape firms\u2019 financing constraints. A firm with imperfect access to equity financing covers financing needs through costly sources: an intermediary and retained cash. The firm\u2019s financing capacity is endogenously determined by either the liquidation value of assets (asset-based) or the intermediary\u2019s going-concern valuation of the firm\u2019s cash flows (cash flow-based). The optimal contract is implemented with defaultable debt \u2014 specifically unsecured credit lines and senior-secured debt \u2014 and features risk-sharing via bankruptcy. When the firm does well, it repays its debt in full. When it does poorly, distress resolution mirrors U.S. bankruptcy procedures (Chapter 7 and 11). Secured and unsecured debt are complements because risk-sharing via unsecured debt increases secured debt capacity. Debt and equity are dynamic complements because future access to equity financing increases current debt capacity.\n\n",
