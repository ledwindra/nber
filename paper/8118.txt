1 Introduction
The issue of “contagion” has been one of the most debated topics in international finance
since the Asian crises. One interesting aspect of this discussion is the strong agreement that
exists among economists on which events have constituted instances of contagion: the Debt
crises in 1982 , the Mexican Tequila effect in December of 1994, the Asian Flu in the last
half of 1997, the Russian Cold in August 1998 (including the LTCM crisis), the Brazilian
Sneeze in January of 1999, and the NASDAQ Rash in April of 2000. Paradoxically, on the
other hand, there is no accordance on what contagion means.
    This paper deals with the question of how to measure contagion, therefore, instead of
providing a list of all its possible definitions and procedures to measure it, this paper con-
centrates on the two most frequently asked questions raised by applied papers in this area:
First, what are the channels through which shocks are propagated from one country to the
other. In other words, is it trade, macro similarities, common lender, learning, or market
phycology, what determines the degree of contagion. And second, does the transmission
mechanism is stable through time? or more specifically does it change during the crises?
    Providing the answer to any of the previous two questions encounters important econo-
metric limitations. Contagion has been associated with high frequency events; hence, it
has been measured on stock market returns, interest rates, exchange rates, or linear com-
binations of them. This data is plagued with simultaneous equations, omitted variables,
conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, non-linearity and non-
normality problems. Unfortunately, there is no procedure that can handle all these problems
at the same time. And therefore, the literature has been forced to take short cuts.
    In this paper, the performance of some of those techniques is evaluated. Obviously, there
is not enough space to study all the possible empirical procedures nor all the problems.
Thus, the paper discusses the most widely used methodologies in the contagion literature:
linear regressions, logit-probit regressions, and tests based on Principal Components and

correlation coefficients1 , and concentrates in the three main problems exhibited by the data:
simultaneous equations, omitted variables, and heteroskedasticity. Issues related to serial
correlation, non-normality and non-linearity are left out of the analysis.
    The paper briefly examines two new procedures that are robust to the problems here stud-
ied. One designed to test for the stability of parameters, and the second one aimed to solve
the problem of identification. In each case, the assumptions underlying the methodologies,
and the circumstances in which they can be used are reviewed.
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the statistical models that are
used in the discussions. Section 3 investigates the problems surrounding the second question
in contagion: test for changes in the propagation mechanism. The paper analyzes this ques-
tion first because the limitations of the standard techniques become evident in simple models.
The section studies alternative corrections for the standard tests and the conditions where
they can be used. Finally, a new procedure to test for parameter stability under simulta-
neous equations, omitted variables and heteroskedasticity is summarized. The assumptions
required for its use are also pointed out.
    Section 4 considers the more complicated question: the measurement of the transmission
channels. Several Monte Carlo simulations are presented to illustrate the problems in the
interpretation of the results when the propagation channel is measured by Probit, OLS
or Principal Components. At the end of the section, a new procedure to estimate the
contemporaneous interrelationship across countries is reviewed. This procedure is robust to
the data problems here emphasized.
    Section 5 applies the two new techniques to measure contagion in Latin American and
South East Asian countries. First, the test on stability of parameters across time is imple-
mented. And second, the transmission mechanism is estimated. Section 6 explores avenues

       I am leaving important aspects of the measurement of contagion out of this analysis. Mainly measures
based on ARCH models (see Edwards and Susmel [2000]), cointegration (see Cashin, et al. [1995], Longuin
and Slonick [1995]), switching regimes (see again Longuin and Slonick [1995]). There are other two techniques
that have not been used yet: factor regression model (see Sentana and Fiorentini [1999] for problems of
estimation in these models when the factors are heteroskedastic), and limitted dependent models under
heteroskedasticity (see Chen and Kahn [2000] and Klein and Vella [2000] for estimation problems in these
models).

for future research. And, section 7 concludes.

2 The models
In order to discuss the problems involved in the measurement of contagion several simple
models are used. Even though, the true description of the world is probably the union of
these particular pieces, the main reason to use minimal statistical frameworks is because it
is easier to highlight the problems there.
    The country variables of interest are denoted by x and y . They reflect either stock
                                                                    t   t


market returns, exchange rates, interest rates, or combinations of them. Without loss of
generality, assume that x and y have being demeaned and are serially uncorrelated. Com-
                          t      t


mon unobservable shocks are denoted by z . These should be interpreted as liquidity shocks,
                                                   t


risk preferences, investor’s sentiments, etc. All the idiosyncratic innovations are denoted by
ε and η . It is assumed that they are independent with mean zero, and also independent
 t      t


from the common shocks. The models concentrate on the bivariate case, although most of
the results can be easily extended to larger setups.
    When the paper focus on the problems of simultaneous equations, the following model
to describe the interrelationship between the countries is used:

                                              yt   =   βxt + εt ,                      (Model 1)
                                          xt       =   αyt + ηt ,

where E [ε ] = 0, E [η ] = 0, and E [ε η ] = 0, and their variances are denoted by σ and σ .
            t         t                   t    t                                       ε      η


When the problem of omitted variables is contemplated, the model used is

                                     yt       =    βxt + γzt + εt ,                    (Model 2)
                                     xt       =    zt + η t .

where, additionally to the previous moment restrictions, it is assumed that E [ε z ] = 0, and
                                                                                 t t




                                                       6
E [η t zt ] = 0.
              The variance of the common shock is σ .     z


    In all these models, the parameter of interest is β (or whether or not it has shifted). It
is assumed that the equation to be fitted is the following:

                                        yt = βxt + ν t                                     (1)

Due to the problems of simultaneous equations and omitted variables it is well known
that this equation cannot be consistently estimated without further information. Formally,
E [x ν ] is different from zero (the “identification condition”) for both Model 1 and Model
     t   t


2, which implies inconsistent estimates.
    One solution is to find valid instruments. However, for the purpose of the paper, it is
assumed that those instruments do not exist. Nevertheless, there are circumstances where it
could be claimed otherwise. For example, it is possible to assume that OECD countries are
unaffected by emerging markets based of large economy arguments. This would motivate
an exclusion restriction, α = 0. Even though this assumption might be appealing, it raises
important questions of why during both the Hong Kong and Russian crises the US and
European stock markets were so heavily influenced. In fact, part of the FED’s motivation to
lower interest rates at the end of 1998 was based on the stability of world markets. Similarly,
it is possible to argue that proxies for the common shocks exists. However, most of these
measure are at best derived from the same prices and volumes the model is explaining. In
this paper, it is assumed that the instruments are weak (whenever they exist), and that the
problems persist.
    To tackle the question on the measurement of the channels of contagion, the statistical
framework has to be slightly more general. Most of the theories of contagion imply that
the transmission of shocks across countries is a function of the strength of the contagion
channel. Therefore, a reduced form of country’s x return would be described by a latent
                                                    i,t

       xi,t   =   α1 X˜i,t + α2 T rade ,˜ X˜i,t + α3 M acro ,˜ X˜i,t + α4 Region ,˜ X˜i,t + ...
                                          i   i                          i   i       i   i



                  +β1 ,i   Liquidityt + β 2,i Riskt   + ... + ε        i,t




where xi,t is the i’th country return. εi,t is the idiosyncratic shock to country i’s fundamentals.
X˜i,t are the returns of the rest of the countries. T rade ,˜ is the vector that measures trade
                                                                             i   i


between country i and other countries, M acro ,˜ is the degree of macro similarities across
                                                           i       i


the countries, while Region ,˜ captures regional characteristics (similarly for other channels
                                  i   i


of contagion not included in the specification). Common unobservable shocks also affect
country returns, and in this example, liquidity shocks and shifts in risk preferences have
been modeled. Other shocks could be incorporated.
   Each country satisfies an analogous equation, which conforms a system of equations:

A1Xt + A2 [T rade] Xt + A3 [M acro] Xt + A4 [Region] Xt + ... = B1 Liquidityt + B2Riskt + ... + εt.

   which can be rewritten as

                  AXt       =   BZt + εt                                                          (2)
                     A      =   A1 + A2 [T rade] + A3 [M acro] + A4 [Region] + ...

                     B      =   {B1 , B2, ...}

                    Zt      =   {Liquidityt , Riskt , ...}     




   This model is too complex to analyze. Therefore, it is simplified it in two directions: First,
Model 3 concentrates on the omitted variable problems with multiple regressors. Therefore,
A is assumed to be triangular, and B different from zero and non-triangular. In particular,




                                                       8
the model with three countries is:

                                      yt        =      βx1,t + zt + εt ,                  (Model 3)
                                     x1,t       =      γ 1zt + η 1,t ,
                                     x2,t       =      γ 2zt + η 2,t ,

where y and z are as before and x are two other countries. The idiosyncratic shocks are
       t       t                          i,t


assumed to be independent.
   In this model, x2 does not enter the structural equations of y . The only relationship
                     ,t                                                              t


between these variables arises from the omitted common shock. The main question is how
well the standard procedures capture the true underlying structure of the model.
   Second, Model 3a focuses on simultaneous equations problems. The common shocks are
shut down (B = 0) and the three country returns are determined by:
                                                                          
                                    y           t
                                                         ε          t
                                                                             
                                 A  x1                  =  η1             ,       (Model 3a)
                                                 ,t                    ,t


                                                x2,t              η2,t

where A is non block diagonal. Again, the question in this model is related to the identifi-
cation of matrix A.
    These models are (in general) estimated using three procedures: OLS, Probit, and Prin-
cipal Components. When OLS is used, it is assumed that the researched fits the following
equation:
                                  y = β 1x1 + β 2x2 + ν .
                                      t                ,t          ,t          t        (3)
It is well known that β1 and β2 will be biased, but the question is the size and direction of
it.
    There is another important strand of the contagion literature that estimates Models 3



                                                            9
and 3a using Probit (Logit or Multinomial) setups. The equation fitted is:

                                 yt∗ = 1 [c + β 1 x1,t + β 2 x2,t > ỹ ]                      (4)

Again, the question is the bias of β 1 and β 2 .
   Finally, the last technique used to determine the importance of the contagion channels
is based on Principal Components estimation on the multivariate system.


3 Testing for changes in the propagation mechanism
A large applied literature defines contagion as a shift in the transmission channel. Hence,
testing for the existence of contagion is implemented as a test for parameter stability.
    The most widely used procedures are based on OLS estimates (including GLS and FGLS),
Principal Components, and correlation coefficients. The objective of the tests is to determine
if there is a change in the coefficients across two different samples; usually crisis and tranquil
periods.
    As will become clear below, if the data suffers from heteroskedasticity and any of the
other two problems (simultaneous equations or omitted variables) then most of the standard
techniques are inappropriate to test for the stability of the parameters.
    It is important to highlight that the standard techniques are only inappropriate if all
problems are present. For example, if the data is homoskedastic, then the tests for parameter
stability are consistent even in the presence of simultaneous equations and omitted variables.
In other words, if the structural change test is rejected, then it has to be explained by
parameter instability. The test does not provide an answer to which one has changed, nor
in which equation, but at least it indicates that a shift has occurred. On the other hand,
if there is only heteroskedasticity then there exists procedures to correct all the traditional
tests and achieve consistency. It is the interaction between the heteroskedasticity and the
other problems what creates the inconsistency in the tests.
    The intuition why this is the case is simple: both the endogenous and the omitted
                                                   10
variable biases depend on the relative variances. If the data exhibits heteroskedasticity, then
the biases shift across the sample. Therefore, it is possible to reject the hypothesis that the
estimates are stable because of the change in the biases, and not because of a shift in the
underlying parameters.
    The objective of this section is to formally show these results. It is organized as follows:
First, it analyzes each of the procedures and their problems. Second, it summarizes some of
the adjustments that can be introduced to (partially) solve them. In some particular cases
there exist exact corrections. However, these adjustments are not general and often only
approximations can be used. Finally, it reviews a new test that is robust to the presence of
all three problems. The section indicates the situations where the test can be used and what
are the assumptions needed.

3.1 Testing using OLS
The OLS estimates of the first equation in Model 1 and Model 2 are:

                            β̂ Mod1 − β   = α (1 − αβ) α2σσε+ σ ,                           (5)
                                                            ε    η

                            β̂ Mod2 − β   = γ σ σ+z σ ,                                     (6)
                                               z     η


respectively. Note that the bias (in both) cases depends on the relative variances of distur-
bances.
   Assume that the question of interest is whether or not the parameters are stable along
the sample. In general, the structural change test takes two forms: either it estimates a β
in the two sub-samples and performs a comparison, or it introduces a dummy in one of the
sub-samples and test for its significance. Independently of the setup, though, the results
indicated below are the same. For simplicity in the exposition, it is assumed that the sample
is split and two separate regressions are run.

Result 1 When there is no heteroskedasticity, then regardless of the simultaneous equations
or omitted variables problems the test for structural change is consistent.
                                                 11
    This results comes from the fact that the biases under the null hypothesis are the same
in both sub-samples. Formally, the difference in the estimates is
                                                           

                                                                        σ            z


in Model 2, where s1 and s2 stand for each sub-sample.
   Under the null hypothesis that α, β, and γ are constant across samples, the difference in
the estimates is zero; it is proportional to the change in the parameters. Thus, the rejection
occurs only if the parameters have shifted.

Result 2 When the data has heteroskedasticity and either simultaneous equations or omitted
variables problems, the test for stability is inconsistent.
    If there is heteroskedasticity in the sample, the test for stability can be rejected under
two cases: (1) if the parameters have changed, or (2) if the variances (and hence the biases)
shifted. To exemplify this point, assume there is heteroskedasticity and that the parameters
are constant. The difference in the estimates is:

invariant). Otherwise, the estimates are different even though the underlying parameters
are constant.2 Moreover, this problem cannot be solved by estimating the parameters using
GLS or FGLS.
    In conclusion, when there are problems of specification the test for stability (based on a
version of the Chow test) is implicitly testing against the joint alternative hypothesis: the
stability of parameters and the homoskedasticity of the residuals. In the particular case of
contagion, it is important to remember that the data is characterized by large shifts in second
moments. Thus, making inference about the stability of parameters in the linear regression
context complicated; the test does not provide the reason for the rejection.

3.2 Testing using Principal Components
Principal Components is a technique designed to find common factors for a set of time series.
The objective of the methodology is well summarized by Kamisky and Reinhart [2000] “in
the case where the original series are identical, the first Principal Component explains 100
percent of the variation in the original series. Alternatively, if the series are orthogonal to
one another, it would take as many Principal Components as there are series to explain all
the variance in the original series. In that case, no advantage would be gained by looking at
common factors, as non exist.”3
   Formally, assume there are K variables each with n observations. Denote the sample
data as X and their covariance matrix as Ω. The first component explains the K series as
best as possible. Thus, it minimizes the discrepancies of

                                                 X −ap   

    Obviously, there exists a change in parameters and heteroskedasticity that exactly cancel each other and
make the test equal to zero. This means that the test has no power against such set of parameters.

of the p matrix is equated to one). It can be shown that the first component corresponds
to the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of Ω. The components of p are known as the
loading and reflect the importance of a particular variable in explaining the rest.
    Principal Components have been widely used to test for the stability of the propagation
mechanism because their estimates are consistent even if the data has simultaneous equations
and omitted variables problems.4 This aspect of the measurement is perhaps the biggest
advantage of using Principal Components.
Result 3 When there is no heteroskedasticity, tests of stability based on Principal Compo-
nents are consistent.
   The intuition of the structural change test based on Principal Components is that if the
loadings in the first component change then the parameters underlying the statistical model
have shifted too. Model 1 implies a covariance matrix equal to:5

Note that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors only depend on the parameters (α and β ) and
the relative variance of the idiosyncratic shocks (θ).
   Therefore, under the assumption of homoskedasticity, a change in the loadings of the
Principal Component indeed implies a shift in the parameters (α and β). These property of
the Principal Components is what grants its use to test for parameter stability. However,
similarly as before, this result only holds in the lack of heteroskedasticity.

Result 4 Tests of parameter stability based on Principal Components are inconsistent in
the presence of heteroskedasticity.

    This result is stronger than the one stated for the OLS case. It says that even in the ab-
sence of simultaneous equation and omitted variable problems the tests of structural change
based on Principal Components are inconsistent if the residuals are heteroskedastic. Hence,
as oppose to the OLS or the correlation case (see below) there is no procedure that can deal
with the existence of heteroskedasticity alone. A shift in the relative variances (θ) alters the
loadings, even if α or β are equal to zero.6
    Again, the fact that contagion is accompanied by large shifts in second moments implies
that comparisons of Principal Components across samples are inadequate as an indication
of parameter stability.
   6
    This result should be intuitive. By the definition of Principal Components, movements in the relative
variances, in the end, must reflect changes in the loadings because the common component is shifting. This
should be true in almost any model.

3.3 Testing using the Correlation
The first paper (to my knowledge) testing for changes in the propagation mechanism using
correlation measures was the influential contribution by King and Wadhwani [1990]. The
intuition of the test is that changes in the underlying coefficients imply a shift in the cor-
relation coefficients as well. This test has been widely used in the literature because of its
simplicity and intuitive implications.
    However, the conditions where a change in correlations imply a shift in the underlying
parameters are restrictive. Ronn [1998] shows that increases in variance implies a rise in the
correlation.7
    For instance, assume the problem of endogenous variables does not exist (make α = 0 in
Model 1). The correlation between x and y is
                                          t             t



                                                  βση
                                ρ=                                = 1β 2

                                                                         +β
which is a function of θ.
    Shocks to the variance of x imply an increase in θ, which causes the absolute value of
                                   t


the correlation to rise too. In the limit, when shocks to country x are infinitely large, the
                                                                               t


idiosyncratic shocks to y are negligible and the correlation between the two variables is one.
                           t


On the other hand, when the variance of η goes to zero the correlation is zero. Note that
                                                    t


the correlation moves from zero to one and the parameter β remains the same.8
Result 5 Tests of parameter stability based on (unadjusted) correlation coefficients are in-
consistent if the data is heteroskedastic.

   The result is stated on unadjusted correlation because there are some cases where the
bias can be corrected. This adjustment was first proposed by Ronn [1998] in the bivariate

setting.9 The main assumption required is that there are no problems of simultaneous
equations or omitted variables and that the heteroskedasticity is fully explained by shifts in
η , and not in ε . In this case, the data provides a measure of the change in θ (which is given
 t               t


by the increase in the variance of x ), and the “unconditional” correlation can be computed.

Where the unconditional correlation can be compared across samples, and its stability is
consequential for tests of structural change.
    The procedure is as follows: assume the variance of x increases in δ, then the correlation

                                                                          .

The implied unconditional correlation is the one that would have prevailed if the errors were
homoskedastic. Hence, it is given by:

                                            ρu =   β                 ,

                                                      

The ρ ’s can be compared across samples. And under the assumptions stated in this deriva-
         u

tion, if they change then it is the case that the β’s have shifted too. The two main advantages
of this procedure are: First, δ can be estimated directly from the sample by looking at the
shift in the variance of x . This makes the adjustment very simple. Second, there is no need
                           t


to estimate β to perform a test of its stability.
    However, as was mentioned before, this adjustment can only be used if there are no

simultaneous equations and omitted variables issues.10 In fact, in this situation, there is no
problem using OLS; thus no need to estimate the correlation coefficient in the first place.
This is the main weakness of using correlation coefficients as an indication of the stability of
a model; the setting under which the change in the correlation coefficient (or its adjustment)
is meaningful, generally justifies the implementation of other methodologies.

3.4     New procedure.
The previous discussion clearly indicates that the empirical question of the stability of para-
meters across countries faces tremendous econometric difficulties. The properties of the data
make procedures that were designed to cope with one of the empirical issues, inappropriate
when all the problems are present.
    This section describes a new methodology to test for structural change under simultane-
ous equations, omitted variables, and heteroskedasticity problems. It is a simplified version
of Rigobon [2000b]. This procedure is based on the assumptions that; (1) the country
generating the crisis is known, and (2) that the changes in the variance of the rest of the
countries is explained, at least in the short run, by the country under crisis, and not by other
idiosyncratic shocks.
    The first assumption is relatively uncontroversial. However, it is important to highlight
that there are several events where this information is not available. For example, during
the EMS crises, who is the country to be blamed for the increase in volatility? The second
  10
    However, as is claimed in Forbes and Rigobon [1998], if the adjustment is practiced only using the
country generating the crisis, then it is still possible to get a good approximation of the unconditional
correlation based on “near identification” arguments. See Fisher [1976]. Where near-identification refers to
the condition when the variance of the shock in one of the equations is significantly larger than the variance
of the shocks in the other equations. In this case, as can be seen by equation (5) the biases tend to zero in
both the simultaneous equations and the omitted variable cases. The estimates get closer to the one when
α = 0 or γ = 0. The periods of crises follow closely this description. For example, during the Mexican crisis
in 1994 the variance of their stock market increased by 15 times following the devaluation in December. One
limitation of this approach is that the adjustment can only be preformed in pair-wise comparisons where the
variable x always corresponds to the country under crisis. Hence, the stability of parameters among two
          t
countries that are not the “originators” of the crisis cannot be tested. The procedure proposed by Boyer, et
al. [1999] has the same characteristics as the one indicated in Forbes and Rigobon and therefore it can be
applied in the same conditions.

assumption is perhaps the most difficult one to acknowledge. It is a crucial assumption but
one that in the contagion literature is reasonable and, indeed it is testable. In the discussion
below, this property of the test is explored more carefully.
      Assume the variables are described by Model 1.11 Additionally, assume that it is known
that in a sub-sample the variances of xt and yt rise because the variance of η t increases, while
the variance of εt remains constant. In this case, two covariance matrices can be computed:
one for the low volatile period, and one for the high volatile period:
                                                                           

which has a determinant equal to zero. In fact, proposition 1 in Rigobon [2000b] applied to
the case studied here states that:

Result 6 (DCC Test) The determinant of the change in the covariance matrices is zero if
the parameters are stable and if the heteroskedasticity is explained by the shift in the variance
of only one of the shocks.

    In other words, if the parameters shift or if the two variances change, then the determinant
of the difference of the covariance matrices is not zero. The model can have common shocks
together with simultaneous equations and still this result holds.12

      The omitted variables case produces identical results.

                                                     19
    Two remarks about the test are worth highlighting: (1) the test is rejected in two sit-
uations: when the parameters shift (which is the interesting case) and when there is het-
eroskedasticity in more than two idiosyncratic shocks. This second rejection is uninteresting
for the purposes of contagion. (2) the test requires the knowledge of the country generating
the increase in volatility, as well as its timing. Even though the country producing the crisis
can be pointed out in some cases, the tranquil and crisis periods might not be as easy to
determine.
    These two weaknesses deserve further discussion.

Two alternative hypotheses.        First, so far, there is no procedure to disentangle between
the two alternative hypothesis. However, an advantage of the test is that if there is no
rejection then the assumption of stability, and the assumption on the particular form of
the heteroskedasticity are accepted. It is only when the test is rejected that the assumption
about the form of the heteroskedasticity becomes crucial for the interpretation of the results.
    The question then, is one of the power of the test. Rigobon [2000] studies the power
against two possible alternative hypothesis: (1) a change in β , and (2) shifts in the two
variances. The main conclusions of that exercise is that with samples sizes around 60 ob-
servations, if the parameters are not too large (α and β should be smaller than 0.8) and if
the observed heteroskedasticity of x and y is relatively large (the variances increase by at
                                            t       t


least 5 times) then the power of the test against both alternative hypotheses is better than
10 percent.
    In applications of contagion both conditions are generally satisfied. First, concerning the
shift in variance, finding changes of the order of 10 times are common in stock markets,

where A, Γ and B are non diagonal matrices. Where the vector of idiosyncratic shocks ε1t and η1t are
transmitted across countries with higher intensity than other vector of idiosyncratic shocks; ε2t and η2t . In
this model, still it is the case that if the heteroskedasticity in a sub-sample is explained by the shift in the
variance of one of the shocks, then the change in the covariance matrix is not full rank. I thank him for all
his comments.

domestic interest rates, exchange rates and Brady Bond returns. Second, estimates larger
than 0.8 imply extremely high interrelationships not even found in Brady Bond markets.
Moreover, straight OLS regression estimates are generally smaller than 0.8. Due to the
endogenous biases it should be expected that these estimates are upward biased, suggesting
that the true parameters are smaller than 0.8.

Definition of the periods.         The second question is related to the definition of the periods
of high and low volatility. One important result of this test is that the determinant of the
change in the covariance is consistent even if the windows are misspecified. This implies that
the test is robust to badly stipulated periods. This is a major advantage of the test because
in most of the contagion events the beginning of the crises are relatively clear, but not their
end. On the other hand, the cost of the misspecification is that the test losses power, thus
it is more likely not to find a rejection.
     The intuition of the consistency of the test is the following: if the periods are misspecified
the estimated covariance matrices are linear combinations of the true underlying matrices.
The difference between the misspecified ones is also a linear combination of the difference of
the true ones. If the original change in matrices is less than full rank, the linear combination
would be so too. Hence, consistency is assured. The loss in power is also understood from
this intuition because the linear combination reduces the difference across the samples by
averaging the underlying matrices.
     It is impossible, in practice, to define the crisis period precisely. Hence, robustness of the
results when the window is modified should be studied.13

When to use the test?        The traditional techniques testing for structural change, in gen-
eral, are not appropriate to test for contagion because the data has simultaneous equations,
omitted variables, and heteroskedasticity problems. There are some adjustments that might
reduce the biases, but in fact, there is no guarantee that those corrections are improving the

across stock markets.

test. More importantly, the conditions under which Principal Components and correlations
estimates can be adjusted are those when OLS could be estimated, and should.
    The test summarized in this section deals with some of the problems that the data has.
Obviously, it depends on a different important assumption: mainly, that the heteroskedastic-
ity has to be explained by a subset of the idiosyncratic shocks. This is the major assumption
(and therefore weakness) of the procedure and should be taken cautiously.
    For example, the application of this methodology during the Mexican crisis satisfies the
premises in the test. It is difficult to claim that the increase in the volatility of the other
Latin American stock markets (following two weeks after the December 19, 1994 devaluation)
is explained by shocks to those particular countries and not a direct consequence of Mexican
problems. In fact, as it is shown in the empirical section, the stability is not rejected for this
crisis.
    However, using the same procedure to test for stability of parameters during the EMS
or the Korean crises is more difficult. Which country should be blamed by the increase in
volatility during the collapse of the EMS? One, two, or all of them? Indeed, if the test is
applied to the EMS and the Korean crises, it would be easy to reject that the determinant
is zero. For the EMS it is clear that no single country can be pointed out as the source of
the heteroskedasticity. For the Korean crisis there does not exists a period of 10 consecutive
days without a crisis in another SEA country. By the characteristics of these two crises, it
should be expected a rejection. However, claiming that it is due to parameter instability is
impossible. Again, this is a case where the rejections are non interesting.
    In the implementation of this methodology the two main questions should be: First,
whether or not the data is heteroskedastic, and that it is large enough. This is the precondi-
tion for the second question: can it be described by shifts in the variances of a subset of the
idiosyncratic shocks? If so, then the procedure here described is a valid test for parameter
stability. Most of the contagion events, however, can answer affirmatively both questions.

4 Measuring the channels of contagion.
The second question that most empirical applications of contagion tackle is the measurement
of the different channels through which shocks are propagate across countries.14 Regardless
of the channels, from the empirical point of view, there exists essentially three approaches
used to measure them: Probit, OLS, and Principal Components.

4.1 Measuring using Probit-Logit.
One of the first empirical papers in the contagion literature was Eichengreen, Rose, and
Wyplosz [1996]. They asked the question, what is the probability that country y faces a
speculative attack, given that country x is suffering one. Their interpretation of contagion
is natural and appealing.
    To implement their test, they take three steps: First, they define an index (capturing the
strength of an speculative attack), second they characterize the crisis as large movements in
such indexes, and third they compute the interrelationship across countries using Probit.15
In order to test for the importance of the different channels of contagion they interacted
the right hand side crises indexes with measures of trade, country similarities, etc. The
interpretation of their results are undoubtedly engaging. However, this model encounters 2
problems: (1) when the residuals are heteroskedastic, (2) when there are omitted variables
and simultaneous equations problems.

Heteroskedasticity in yt ’s residuals: One of the most difficult problems to solve in
limited dependant variable regressions is the consistency of the estimates when the residuals
of the selection equation are heteroskedastic. Several procedures have been developed to deal
  14
     These channels are based on a large theoretical literature and they usually include trade, country simi-
larities, common lender, learning, liquidity, distance, etc. See Goldstein, Kaminsky and Reinhart [2000] and
the references therein for a survey of the models.
  15
     Other papers have also used probit regressions to measure contagion. See Eichengreen et al.[2000] in the
context of measuring the probability of issuing foreign debt. See also Bae, Karolyi and Stulz [2000] for an
application using multinomial regressions.


                                                     23
with this issue: For example,   Maximum Score (see Manski [1985] , Horowitz [1992, 1993])
and Symmetric Trimming (see Powell [1986], and also Honore [1992] and Honore, Kyriazidou
and Udry). These methodologies are able to handle the estimation biases. Nevertheless, they
have not being used in contagion applications yet. On the other hand, the lack of control
for heteroskedasticity affects significantly the estimates. This is the discussion highlighted
in this section.
    A Monte Carlo simulation is run to quantify the bias. Assume that the returns are
described by Model 3a, where the matrix A is given by
                                                          
                                                1 −α −α 
                                          A =  −α 1 −α  .
                                                  −α −α 1
Assume that the third shock (η2 ) is the only one that suffers from heteroskedastic.
                                      ,t

    The Monte Carlo simulation consists of 500 random-independent draws of the three
shocks, with sample length of 1000 observations each. The sample of η2 is split in two and
                                                                           ,t


the second half is assumed to have higher variance. Three different degrees of heteroskedas-
ticity are studied: increases by 2, 5, and 10 times. Three different values of α are also studied
(0.1, 0.2, and 0.3).
    The variables y , x1 , and x2 are computed for each realization using Model 3a, and the
                       t   ,t        ,t


variable y∗ = 1 [y > 0] is calculated afterwards. Finally, the Probit regression (equation (4))
          t        t


is estimated: y∗ = 1 [c + β1x1 + β2x2 ].
               t                ,t           ,t


    The objective of the exercise is to compare the estimates of the coefficients (β 1 and β2)
with and without heteroskedasticity. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
    In Table 1 the results for the first coefficient (β̂1) are summarized. The first four rows
are the estimates when α = 0.1, the next four rows are the estimates when α = 0.2, while
the last four are the results for α = 0.3. For each value of α there are four rows: The first
one are the results under homoskedasticity, which is the benchmark for comparison. The
next three rows are the three heteroskedasticities studied.

of heteroskedasticity. For each simulation 500 draws are computed. The tranquil sample and
the high volatile sample are 500 observations long each.
    The first column are the point estimates. Their standard deviations are not shown
because the objective of the simulation is to concentrate on the difference between the
estimates. However, it is important to highlight that all of them were statistically different
from zero. The second column is the difference between the estimates with heteroskedasticity
and the respective one under homoskedasticity. The third column shows the computed
standard deviation of the difference. It was obtained by bootstrapping. The fourth column
calculates the t-statistic.
    Three remarks can be extracted from the table: First, an increase in the heteroskedasticity
of x2 biases the estimates of x1 upward. Second, the larger the heteroskedasticity is, the
     ,t                             ,t


larger its bias is. Thirdly, the larger the true coefficient is (α bigger) the higher the relative
impact of the heteroskedasticity. Nevertheless, even though these patterns are quite strong,
statistically it is impossible to reject the hypothesis that all coefficients are the same as those
under homoskedasticity.
    Table 2 shows the results for the x2 coefficient. In this case the hypotheses of equality
                                               ,t


across degrees of heteroskedasticity are rejected.

of heteroskedasticity. For each simulation 500 draws are computed. The tranquil sample and
the high volatile sample are 500 observations long each.
    First, note that the bias is downward, as oppose to upward. Second, the patterns about
the effects of the heteroskedasticity and the size of α on the bias are the same as before.
Thirdly, changes in volatility of the order of 10 times imply coefficients that are almost half
the size from those under homoskedasticity.
    The last exercise performed is the comparison of the β̂1 and β̂2 estimates for the same
set of parameters. By construction (of matrix A), they should be the same. In fact, under
homoskedasticity the estimates are almost identical. However, under these parameters, when
one of the variables suffers from heteroskedasticity, its estimate goes down, while the estimate
of the other one goes up. Moreover, their differences are statistically significant.
    This later property is perhaps conceivably the most important regarding the interpre-
tation of the results from the contagion literature: If the heteroskedasticity is correlated
with some channel then we could be finding spurious relationships. For example, assume
all contemporaneous coefficients are the same and the heteroskedasticity is correlated with
the exchange rate regime. In particular, assume that stock market in dollars are more het-
eroskedastic during flexible regimes than during fixed regimes. A Probit regression, in this

                                                    26
case, might conclude that countries that share the same regime have stronger interrelation-
ships, and thus more likely to suffer from contagion.

Identification of parameters:         A second difficulty in the estimation of equation (4) arises
when the data has simultaneous equations or omitted variables problems alone. In order
to illustrate this issue, a Monte Carlo simulation is run, estimating Model 4 where the
underlying returns are given by Model 3.16
    The same procedure as before is implemented: (i) 500 independent realizations of the
shocks are drawn; (ii) x and y are constructed using Model 3; (iii) y∗ = 1 [y > 0] is
                             i,t       t                                                  t       t


computed; and (iv) the Probit is run, where y∗ = 1 [c + β1x1 + β2x2 ].
                                                     t                ,t         ,t


    The parameters chosen were: β = 0.2, γ 1 = 0.1, γ 2 was varied from 0.1 to 0.5, the
variance of ε , η1 , and η2 are equal to one, and the variance of z was changed as follows
              t    ,t         ,t                                             t


{0.1, 1, 5, 10}. Just as a clarification point, there is no heteroskedasticity in this exercise.
The different volatilities of z are studied to understand the implications on the estimates
                                   t


when the (relative) importance of the omitted variable changes.
    The objective of these simulation, indeed, is to show how the biases in the estimates
change for the different volatilities and coefficients of the omitted variable shock.
    By construction, if the estimates are consistent, β̂1 should be equal to β, and β̂2 should
be equal to zero. In the omitted variable case, when the variance of z is small relative to
                                                                                      t


the other shocks, it is expected that the bias is small. The converse should occur when the
variance of z is large. The results shown in Table 3, confirm this intuition.

equations setups.

estimates of β̂ 2 are statistically insignificant. Second, when the variance of the common
shock increases both estimates are biased upward. This is the case because the γ ’s are           i


positive in both structural equations. Third, as should be expected, the larger γ 2 is, the
higher the bias on β̂ 2 is. Fourth, it is possible that β̂ 2 > β̂1 and statistically significant.
    In the theoretical literature of contagion, unobservable shocks have constituted an integral
part of the propagation mechanisms. There is a large literature arguing in favor of liquidity
shocks and shifts in risk preferences as major contributors to the excess comovement of stock
markets, interest rates, and exchange rates in emerging markets.17 If all coefficients are posi-
tive, then the existence of these common shocks upward biases the degree of interrelationship
across countries.

4.2 Measuring using OLS
A second strand of the literature measures the propagation mechanism using OLS regres-
sions.18 The problems are similar to the ones described in the previous sub-section.
    Assume the data is produced by Model 3. The OLS estimates are given by (after some
algebra):
                                                  σz
                               β̂ 1   =    β1 +      γ σ η,2
                                                   φ 1
                                                 σz
                               β̂ 2   =    β 2 + γ 2σ η,1
                                                   φ
                                                2                  
                                φ     =    σ z γ 2σ η,1 + γ 21 σ η,2 + ση,1 ση,2


Note that the true values are β 2         = 0 and β 1 = β.     However, the biases can make β̂ 2 larger
than zero, and even significant. Moreover, depending on the signs of the γ s and the relative
                                                                                     




variances, it is also possible that β̂ 1 is insignificant. In this model, any conclusion about the

if Model 3a is used. See appendix A for an example.
    A Monte Carlo simulation is run, using the same coefficients as in the previous sub-
section, to compare the size of the biases. In Table 4 the results are shown. As can be seen,
the patterns in the estimates are similar to those from Table 3.

    One advantage of OLS over Probit is that it is robust to heteroskedasticity, while Probit is
not. In the OLS case, the larger inconvenience that introduces the existence of heteroskedas-
ticity is to underestimate the standard deviations, but there are several procedures that can
handle this concern.

4.3 Measuring using Principal Components
As was indicated in the section 3.2, tests for changes in parameters based on Principal
Components are biased in the presence of heteroskedasticity. In this section, a stronger
claim is made: the estimates, by itself, are inconsistent too.
    Using the same example as in section 3.2, equation (7) is the first Principal Component,
reproduced here for convenience:
                                                        √   

                                                                 
                                                    1

Note that it is not a linear function of θ. Therefore, the heteroskedasticity (volatility in θ)
biases the loadings. For example, assume the countries are positively correlated (which is
almost always the case in contagion: α and β are positive). Then, those countries in which its
idiosyncratic variance changes more (larger volatility in θ ) have higher loadings (all things
                                                                     t


equal). It is possible, therefore, that strong linkages are found because the heteroskedasticity
is high for those countries.
    A Monte Carlo simulation was run in this case, but for brevity the results are not pre-
sented, only the conclusions from that exercise. First, the heteroskedasticity in the second
shock implies that the loading of the first country in the first component is downward bi-
ased. This should be expected because when α and β are positive equation (7) is a convex
function of θ. An increase in the heteroskedasticity implies that the second country be-
comes relatively more important explaining their common component. Moreover, the larger
the heteroskedasticity is, the higher the downward bias is. Second, when the loadings are
compared across different degrees of heteroskedasticity, their estimates were statistically dif-
ferent. Finally, it is easy to show that if the structural errors are properly normalized, then
the bias disappears. However, this normalization is only possible if the data does not suffer
from simultaneous equations nor omitted variable problems. In these cases, it is worth asking
why use Principal Components when OLS (or FGLS) is consistent? This is conceivably the
highest weakness of Principal Components as a procedure to test and measure contagion.
                                                    31
If the heteroskedasticity is not taken into consideration, then the estimates and conclusions
might be biased. On the other hand, the only circumstances where it can be corrected are
those in which OLS should be used.

4.4     New procedure
In the contagion literature, the issues of heteroskedasticity, simultaneous equations and omit-
ted variables are unavoidable. Specially, because there are no good instruments to solve
them.19 Moreover, the fact that most papers use “indexes” instead of exchange rates, or
interest rates, directly exacerbates the problems even more.
    In general, the index is constructed as a linear combination of the high frequency macro
variables. The advantage is, for example, that speculative attacks might have different
implications depending on how Central Banks decide to cope with it. The index captures the
aggregate strength of the response by looking at all its possible consequences. On the other
hand, the disadvantage is that using prices and exchange rates jointly in an index aggravates
the endogeneity problems. Making the inference about the transmission mechanism more
complicated. Using an index to measure the propagation of shocks has strong theoretical
justification, and intuitive appeal, but it is important to remember that it encounters equally
strong econometric complications.
    In this section, a review of a new procedure developed by Rigobon [2000a] is presented.
The objective of the methodology is to provide a consistent estimate of the contemporaneous
  19
     For example, using lag returns is not a valid instrument for simultaneous equations. It is instrumenting
for other problems, such as errors in variables, but not for endogeneity
   Arguing that lag dependent variables are an instruments is making the implicit assumption that the
home stock market returns depend on past own returns and current foreign returns, but not on lag foreign
returns. And conversely, foreign current returns depend on own lag anc current home returns, but not on
lag home returns. The theoretical foundations for this assumption are extremely weak. If foreign returns
are informative about dometic returns at any point in time, and past home returns are informative about
current home returns, then why past foreign returns are not informative about current home reutrns? In
fact, I have not seen (yet) a theoretical model that has the three implications. Either all lag values explain
contemporaneous returns, or non. In practice, the lag dependent variables are instrumenting for other issues
such as errors in variables, etc. but they are not instrumenting for endogeneity. Moreover, causality test in
this environment is biased. It is well known that simultaneous equations with lag endogenous variables can
have any implication on the Granger-causality tests.

relationship across variables even if the data suffers from heteroskedasticity, simultaneous
equations and omitted variables. Here only the case of simultaneous equations is illustrated,
for the general treatment see the original reference.
    Assume there are K variables jointly determined satisfying the following relationship:

                                            AXt = εt

where A is a KxK non-triangular matrix, X is the matrix of country variables, and ε

is the vector of idiosyncratic shocks. The diagonal of A is usually set to one: which is the
normalization assumption. Additionally, it is commonly assumed, in macro applications, that
the idiosyncratic shocks are uncorrelated: E [ε ε ] = 0 for all i = j . This is the covariance
                                                  i,t j,t


restriction used in most macro-applications. Still with all these assumptions, however, A
cannot be estimated. The reason is that from the reduced form only the covariance matrix
from X can be obtained, which constitutes an underidentified system of equations.

    Formally, the reduced form is

unknowns are K from the variances of the idiosyncratic shocks, and K (K − 1) from matrix
A. Note that for any K > 1 the number of unknowns is strictly larger than the number of
knows. This is the standard identification problem raised by simultaneous equations.
   The key feature of the Rigobon’s identification is the realization that under the exact
same restrictions the existence of heteroskedasticity adds additional constraints.

                                               33
    The simplest case is when the heteroskedasticity can be described by two regimes: high
and low variance. In this instance, there are two covariance matrices providing K (K + 1)
equations, whereas the number of unknowns is: 2K from the variances of the idiosyncratic
shocks (K for each regime), but the same K (K − 1) from matrix A. Thus, the system
is just identified: K (K + 1) = 2K + K (K − 1). Moreover, it should be clear that it is
overidentified when there are more than two regimes. Therefore, for richer descriptions
of the heteroskedasticity, an overidentification test can be implemented and the parameter
stability can be examined.
    The key assumptions are that there is heteroskedasticity, that the parameters are stable,
and that the structural shocks are uncorrelated. This is exactly the case of most macro
applications where VAR models have been used, and financial applications where ARCH or
GARCH models have been computed. In the derivation here developed, only unconditional
heteroskedasticity has been studied. Similar arguments can be extended to include the case
where only conditional changes in the volatility occur.
    Using this methodology, a consistent estimate of A can be obtained regardless of the
problem of endogenous and omitted variable biases. Afterwards, A can be explained as a
function of the different channels of contagion. This is the objective of the next section.

5 An application to Emerging Markets.
This section examines the questions of stability of the propagation of shocks across Latin
American and South East Asian countries around the recent crises; how important those
linkages are; and what determines them. The first question is implemented as the test for
parameter stability introduced in Section 3.4. While the other two questions are answered
by using the methodology described in Section 4.4.
    Two data sets are used: sovereign bonds and stock markets. The data for stock markets
was collected from Datastream, and it consists of daily stock market returns (in dollars)
for 14 countries, covering the period from January 1993 to December 1998. The countries

                                             34
studied are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines,
Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, US, and Venezuela.
    The sovereign bond data contains the daily country bond returns from January 1994
to December 1998 obtained from the Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+) con-
structed by JPMorgan. The EMBI+ country indexes track total returns for traded external
debt instruments in emerging markets. Most of the bonds covered are Brady Bonds, but also
other foreign denominated bonds are taken into consideration. The indexes are computed
by simulating holding a portfolio with the weights determined by risk, market capitaliza-
tion, liquidity, and collateral considerations. The countries included in the Bond data are
Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. The only two South
East Asian countries in the JPMorgan data are Korea and Philippines, but the length of
their data is small in comparison to the other countries. Thus, they were dropped from the
analysis.
    Information on US interest rates is obtained from Datastream. For all the results pre-
sented in this paper the 10 year US Government bond was used. This bond has the closest
maturity to the average sovereign bond in the data. However, robustness checks were per-
formed by using shorter horizons (1 year and 3 month) and the results were qualitatively
the same.
    The objectives of looking at these two markets are to compare the transmission mecha-
nisms, to determine how much trade explains about the propagation mechanism in each of
them, and to compute the importance of liquidity shock in both.

5.1    Test for stability
The stability of parameters for both the stock and bond markets is studied by performing
the DCC test described in section 3.4. This test is based on the assumption that in a sub-
sample the heteroskedasticity is explained by the heteroskedasticity in only a sub-set of the
shocks. Moreover, it has to be either a sub-set of the idiosyncratic shocks, or a sub-set of
the common shocks. The easiest way to satisfy this condition is to concentrate the analysis

                                             35
around the crises. During these periods, the assumption that the increase in the variance
of all emerging markets is a consequence of the country producing the crisis is a reasonable
one.
    As will become clear next a considerable amount of time is devoted to the definition
of these windows. The main reason is if a rejection is found in a poorly design test, its
interpretation becomes cumbersome.

5.1.1 The model
It is assumed that returns in stock and bond markets are described by a latent factor model

                                 AX = φ(L)X + Γz + ε
                                    t                 t   t   t




where X represent the country returns, A is the contemporaneous linkages (the coefficients
        t


of interest), φ(L) is a matrix of lags. z is a one dimensional unobservable shock, Γ are
                                         t


the parameters of how common shocks affect country returns (or vulnerabilities). ε are the
                                                                                   t


idiosyncratic shocks assumed to be uncorrelated among themselves, and with respect to the
common shock.
    For normalization purposes, the diagonal of A is assumed to be equal to one, and the
coefficient on the US in Γ is set to 0.1. The imposition of this normalization means that
studying the relative importance of common shocks versus idiosyncratic shocks cannot be
performed by looking at the standard deviation of the shocks. Rather, a variance decompo-
sition exercise has to be conducted.
    The reduced form of this model is the following:

                           Xt   = A−1φ(L)X + A−1 [Γz + ε ]
                                                  t           t   t


                                = Φ(L)X + ν .t        t                                  (8)




                                                 36
Where the reduced form residuals satisfy,

                                       Aν t   = Γz + ε .
                                                    t   t                                  (9)

Note that the procedures developed in section 3.4 deals with the stability and identification
of parameters is equation (9). Because the reduced form residuals share the same contempo-
raneous properties as the returns, in the estimation first, a VAR is run in the whole sample
to eliminate the serial correlation (equation (8)). After the residuals, ν , are recovered from
                                                                         t


the estimation, the regimes are defined, and the test for stability is performed on the residu-
als. An immediate question that arises concerning this procedure is what are the parameters
tested for. Indeed, it is testing for the stability of A, Γ, and φ(L). At a first glance, the
inclusion of φ(L) in this list this might be surprising, but see the appendix for a formal
derivation.
    For brevity, the results from the VAR’s are not presented.

5.1.2 Definition of the windows.
In order to implement the DCC test a high and low volatile regime has to be defined.
Moreover, for the alternative hypothesis to be informative, the periods have to be determined
in such a way that the assumption about the heteroskedasticity is likely to be satisfied. In
practice, concentrating around the crises should increase the likelihood of satisfying such
assumptions.
    From 1994 to 1998 international markets faced 3 major crisis. Those are used to define
the regimes. In Table 5 the low and high volatile dates are shown.
    For the Mexican crisis, the low volatile regime is defined as the period from June to
December of 1994 right before the devaluation. The high volatile regime starts with the
devaluation in December, 19th of 1994. The end of this period, however, is unclear. After
the Mexican devaluation several other shocks occurred; the discussion of the rescue package
in January, for instance. These shocks maintained the high volatility for several months.

Therefore, two possible crisis regimes are studied: one ending in January 8th, and the other
one lasting until March 31st. The choice of January 8th is based on the fact that in January
9th the non-rollover of the short term debt was announced. This produced a large shock
in bond markets around the world. Indeed, the EMBI+ dropped by almost 6 percent that
day. This shock could be interpreted as a liquidity shock, and therefore, in the model here
estimated as a common shock. The DCC would reject if there is heteroskedasticity in both a
idiosyncratic and a common shock. Therefore, these samples should be considered separately.
Indeed, three cases are studied, one staring with the devaluation and ending before January
9, another one starting in January 9th and lasting until the end of March, and the last one
that includes both periods.
    Looking at this two samples together has the following advantages: it should be expected
that the DCC test will produce a rejection in the bond market data for the two periods
together. This, implicitly, is a test of how powerful the test is in this data. However, if
indeed there is a shift in the parameters after January 9, but not before, then the test is
rejected also when that period is under consideration. In other words, if the rejection only
occurs when the two high volatile samples are put together, then it is possible to argue that

                                                 38
it is due to not satisfying the heteroskedasticity assumption. On the other hand, if there
is a rejection in one of the sub-samples, it must be the case that together they are also
rejected. This will allow us to identify the period in which the parameters have shifted.
Similar exercises are implemented in the next two crises.
     The Asian crises started in June of 1996 with Thailand’s devaluation and lasted further
into 1998 until the Korean crisis. For the particular case of the Asian crises the tranquil
period is always defined as the six months prior to Thailand’s devaluation. Several high
volatile periods are defined. The Thailand crisis started at the beginning of June 1997.
The Hong Kong crisis started in October 27th, 1997. The Korean crisis started around
December 15th, 1997. The Hong Kong crisis is the only one that has a clear initial date
which is obtained by the day in which short term interest rates increased dramatically. For
the other two crises, however, the initial day is unclear because there is important action on
the bond and stock market prior to the exchange rate devaluation.
     During the Asian crises several combination of windows are studied. However, it is
important to highlight that even though some of these windows include several crisis, they
should not become a violation of the heteroskedasticity assumption. In the bond market
data, all South East Asian countries are excluded from the regression, thus, these crises are
summarized by the common unobservable shock. Therefore, it is a sub-set of the shocks and
no rejection should be obtained because the heteroskedasticity assumption was not satisfied.
On the other hand, for the stock market data, all the countries are included in the regression,
and therefore the South East Asian crises can be modelled as changes in the volatility of
a sub-set of the idiosyncratic shocks. Again, the DCC should not be rejected because of
ill-specified heteroskedasticity.
     Finally, the third crisis studied is the Russian and LTCM collapses. The tranquil period
goes from March to July of 1998, and several high volatile periods are studied: First, the
pure Russian collapse started at the beginning of August. Second, the LTCM problems
appeared at the end of August and lasted until the end of September. Finally, in October,
there is another shocks which is a speculative attack to the Brazilian currency. Hence, as in

                                              39
the Mexican case, the LTCM collapse has been associated with an aggregate liquidity shock.
    Several sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results to
(minor) changes in the definition of the windows. The results are robust to those, but no
robustness should be expected to a random definition of regimes. It is crucial, and I hope
this discussion has make it clear, that in order to implement the test a comprehensive view
of the changes in second moments have to be imposed before running the test. Otherwise,
rejections are meaningless.

5.1.3 Stock markets
Given the regimes/windows, the next step is to estimate the covariance matrix of the residuals
from the reduced form and perform the DCC test.
    In Table 6, the change in covariance matrices is shown for all the choices of windows.
This table shows how large the heteroskedasticity (on average) is. In order to compute the
change in the covariance matrix two different norms were used: The first column represents
the average change in the variances. The relative change for all countries is computed from
the covariance matrices and the average is reported. The second column shows the increase
in the maximum singular value, which is perhaps the most informative measure.
    As can be seen, the volatile regimes represent important changes in variance. For example,
during the Mexican crisis an average increase in variance of 8 times was observed. Similarly,
during the Hong Kong speculative attack the increase in stock markets was almost 12. These
increases in volatility represent a significant rise in volatility in emerging markets. Remember
that the data include countries such as US, Singapore, Chile, etc. where the increases in
volatility during this sample were smaller than 2.
    After the covariance matrices are estimated, the determinant on their change is computed.
The results for the Stock market test are shown in Table 7. The first column indicates the
point estimate, the second column is the computed standard deviation, the third one is
the mass below zero, and the fourth one is and indicator, where 1 means that the test of
stability was rejected. The standard deviation and the mass below zero are computed using

a bootstrap. The procedure uses the changes in conditional variance across the windows to
produce several covariance matrices. Then it computes the determinant on the change and
estimates both the standard deviation as well as the mass below zero. Standard deviations
are large because the small sample distribution of the determinant is not normal, thus, to
give the test some chance of rejection the mass below zero is used. The dummy is set to one
if the proportion of the simulations with determinant smaller that zero (mass below zero) is
either 10 or 90 percent.
    Observe that in Table 7, there is no single case in which the test is rejected. The
immediate question is whether or not the test has power. Two remarks in this respect; in
Rigobon [2000b] it is shown that for the size of these windows and the observed changes
in variance, the test is quite powerful (type II errors were smaller than 10 percent for a
test with size 5 percent). Second, as will be seen below, using bond data there are some
rejections. Therefore, the lack of rejection could not be entirely blamed on the power of the
test. Hence, this evidence suggests that the propagation of shocks across stock markets is
(relatively) stable during the recent crises.

5.1.4 Bond markets
This section turns its attention to the bond market. The same windows as before were used
to test for the stability of parameters among EMBI+ indexes.
    In Table 8, the change in covariance matrices is shown again to highlight the changes
in variances experienced in the sample. The interpretation of the columns is the same as
before. Note that in this case, however, the shift in the variances are larger than the ones
found in stock markets.
    Specially, observe that during the Mexican crisis after the non-rollover announcement
the variances doubled. Likewise, the LTCM collapse implied an increase in volatility above
the one that was already experienced by the Russian crash. Take into consideration that
this pattern was absent in the stock market data (see Table 6). This confirms the common
wisdom in market participants that the aftermath of the Mexican crisis and the LTCM
shocks were mainly shocks to the bond markets.
    On the other hand, an interesting aspect in this table is that excluding the Hong Kong
speculative attack, the Asian crises had almost no impact on the variance of Latin American
bond markets, at least in their volatilities. Remember that if the heteroskedasticity is small

the DCC test has little power. So, a lack of rejection should be expected during the South
East Asian crisis for the bond data.
   The results for the Bond market DCC test are shown in Table 9. The interpretation of
the table is the same as in the stock market. In this case, there are two instances in which
the parameters are unstable. The January 9th shock and the LTCM collapse. Note that the
DCC test is rejected when these crises are analyzed separately or jointly with other events.
Suggesting that the test is rejected because a shift in the parameters during those times,
and not because there is the alternative hypothesis is misspecified.
   In the Mexican case the test is rejected if the sample covers the period from January to
March, or from December 19th to March. Similarly, the test is rejected for the LTCM crisis
alone (end of August plus September) or if it is included together with the Russian crisis, or
with the Russian and Brazilian attacks. However, no instability was found after October of
1998. Thus, indicating that the changes in the transmission mechanism across bond markets
occurred shortly after the LTCM collapse.
   In summary, the events in which the test is rejected reflect instances where important

common shocks are happening to the bond market. Market participants have identified these
two particular events with liquidity shocks. In the setup here estimated, there is more to
these shocks than a pure liquidity shock. In equation (9) the presence of a liquidity shock
has been already taken into consideration by the inclusion of z . The fact that the DCC
                                                                       t


is rejected implies, then, that either the relationship is non-linear or there is a change in
the intensity in which the liquidity shocks are propagated. With the techniques available,
unfortunately, there is no procedure that can disentangle between this two explanations.

5.2    Estimation of the propagation mechanism
In this sub-section, the contemporaneous relationship between stock markets and bond re-
turns is estimated. The questions of interest are threefold: What is the estimate of A? How
much trade and regional variables explain A? And what is the relative importance of the
common shocks (z ) across crises and regimes?

5.2.1   Model and identification

As before, it is assumed that returns are described by the same latent factor model

                                  AXt     = φ(L)X + Γz + ε .
                                                   t        t    t                            (10)

Assumed that there are C common shocks and K endogenous variable. Again, a VAR is
estimated first and the tests are performed on the reduced from residuals equation (9).

Identification:    The procedure described in Section 4.4 shows that under orthogonality
of the structural shocks and the existence of heteroskedasticity, it is possible to identify an
equation such as equation (10) if the heteroskedasticity is righ enough.
    Given the number of endogenous and omitted variables, the unknowns in the system of
equations are: K (K − 1) unknowns are the parameters from matrix A. C (K − 1) parameters
from Γ after normalization. K times S variances from the idiosyncratic shocks: there are
K variances of idiosyncratic shocks for each regime in the heteroskedasticity (S ). And C
times S variances from the common shocks: there are C variances of common shocks for
each regime. Therefore, the total number of unknowns is

                     ( − 1) + C (K − 1) +
                   K K                                 KS             +       CS          .   (11)
                     from   A      from   Γ    idiosyncratic shocks       common shocks



    The first condition for identification is that each regime in the heteroskedasticity should
add more equations than unknowns. This is required for the order condition to be satisfied.
Each new covariance matrix adds K (K + 1)/2 equations (which is the covariance matrix
estimated on the residuals), while it adds K new idiosyncratic variances, and C new common
shock variances. Therefore, each regime adds more equations than unknowns if and only if
                                   K (K + 1) > K + C
                                       2
                                   K (K − 1) > 2C                                             (12)

                                                45
This is the “catch up” constraint.
   After condition (12) is satisfied, then there has to exist a minimum number of regimes
that imply that there exists at least the same number of equations than unknowns. The
number of knows is provided by the covariance matrix in each regime and it is equal to:
                                                    K (K + 1) S.                             (13)
                                                            2

Therefore, imposing that equation (13) is larger or equal than equation (11), and solving for
S , the minimum number of regimes required for identification is
                                           S ≥ 2 (KK+2 −CK) (K− 2−C1) .                      (14)

    In the two examples studied here one common shock is allowed. Therefore, the number
of regimes required for identification in each case is the following:
   1. In the bond markets there are 8 countries (endogenous variables). The “catch up”
      constraint (12) is easily satisfied and the minimum number of regimes is S ≥ 14/6.
   2. For the stock market case there are 14 countries. Thus, inequality (12) is satisfied and
      the number of regimes required is S ≥ 13/6. In summary, three regimes are enough to
      achieve identification in both examples.

Estimation:          From the reduced form, equation (9), the covariance matrix of residuals is
given by
                                    Ωνt   = A−1ΓΩ ΓA−1 + A−1Ω A−1.

Where the left hand side are the estimate of the covariance matrix in regime t ∈ {1, . . . , S },
and the right hand side are the coefficients of interest. This is a non-linear system of equations
that is estimated by GMM, where equation (15) is the set of moment restrictions.20
  20
       Actually, instead of computing inverses of A the moment restriction estimated is
                                            AΩνt A − ΓΩzt Γ − Ωεt = 0

    After the VAR is estimated and the residuals have been recovered (which in fact are the
same residuals as those used in the previous section), the regimes are defined, the covariance
matrices calculated, and the system of equations is estimated. An important aspect of
the identification through heteroskedasticity is that the estimates are consistent even if the
regimes are misspecified. Therefore, the definition of the windows is by looking at the
periods of medium and high volatility derived from the conditional volatility. Furthermore,
the identification is obtained if the changes in variance are conditional or not, thus, the use
of the sample covariance matrices to determine the regimes is easily justified.21
    For Stock markets the sample studied runs from July 1994 to the end of 1998. For bond
markets, we exclude the Mexican and Russian crises, thus the sample runs from April 1st 1995
until July 31st 1998. The assumption of parameter stability is crucial for the identification,
and the previous sub-section have already shown that bond markets had unstable parameters
during the first quarter of 1995 and after August 21st of 1998.
    Again, the results from the VAR are not shown.

5.2.2 Stock markets
Definition of the regimes: Taking the residuals from the VAR, first, a 20 days rolling
window covariance matrix was computed. A norm on the covariance matrix was defined (in
this paper, the maximum singular value was used. However, other measures produced very
similar splits in the regimes). Second, using the conditional covariance matrices the regimes
were defined as follows: the low volatile regime are those days in which the matrix norm is
smaller than the average; the high volatile regime are the dates in which the norm is larger
than two standard deviations of the mean; and the medium regime is the rest of the sample.
which is simpler and more stable. However, always the invertibility of A has to be checked.
  21
     In a separate paper, I have already solved the problem of identification when only conditional het-
eroskedasticity exists. The proof is very similar to the one shown here. Deriving the reduced form from a
structural model where the residuals have GARCH effects and the structural shocks are uncorrelated pro-
duces a restricted GARCH equation that fully identifies the simultaneous coefficients in the level equation.
The estimation in this case is simpler because MLE can be used directly. The intuition of the identification,
though, is exactly the same as the one derived here. The paper will be available in my web page at the end
of January 2001 (when proper reference will be provided).


                                                     47
    In Figure 1 the three regimes are shown, where 1 corresponds to the low, 2 is the medium
and 3 is the high volatile period. There are 848 observations in the low volatile regime,
329 in the medium volatile regime, and 95 in the high volatile regime. It is important to
highlight that the regimes coincide with most of the crises and events in which “contagion”
had been suspected to have existed.
    Finally, after the windows are defined, the covariance matrix in each regime is computed
and the GMM is implemented to estimate equation (15).
    Distributions and standard deviations were computed by bootstrap. The idea is to draw
several covariance matrices and solve the system of equations for each realization. How-
ever, assuming that the covariance matrices across regimes are independent is unsatisfactory.
Thus, in order to take into consideration the serial correlation in the covariance matrices,
it was assumed that only the change in the covariances was independent across regimes.
Therefore, conditional on the point estimates of the covariance matrices of the reduced form,
random draws of covariance matrices were obtained consistent with the sample size in each
regime and its covariance structure. For each set of covariance matrices the system of equa-
tions is solved (using GMM) and this process is repeated 100 times. The distribution of the
coefficients is the solution to each of the realizations of the system of equations.

Contemporaneous transmission mechanism: The results of estimating A are shown
in Table 10. The diagonal is omitted because it is known that it is equal to one, and the
sign of the coefficients have been changed so they can be understood as the elasticities in
the right hand side (its natural interpretation).
    The row represents the equation of that country, and the columns are the regressors.
Therefore, the reading of the coefficients is as follows: the row country (Argentina) is con-
temporaneously affected by the column country (Mexico) by a coefficient of 0.234. The
coefficients that are statistically significant different from zero at 90 percent confidence are
in bold type, where the confidence interval is computed using the bootstrapped distribution.
    Several remarks from Table 10 are worth highlighting. First, the coefficients in the US

procedure, even though our prior would have suggested so. On the other hand, US affects
importantly some of the emerging markets.
    Second, the coefficients are relatively large, explaining the high comovement that exists
among international stock markets. In fact, these coefficients explain correlations of an
average of 22 percent among all countries.

30 possible coefficients. Similarly, among the South East Asian countries 12 out of 42 are
significantly different from zero. Interestingly, there are only 3 (out of 84) coefficients across
regions (excluding those from the US) that are statistically different from zero; These are
the propagations from Chile to Korea, from Chile to Thailand, and from Korea to Mexico.
This confirms, quite strongly, the common wisdom that the propagation of shocks across
countries was concentrated within geographical regions.
    In Table 11, the standard deviation of the coefficients is shown, which are obtained from
the bootstrap. One appealing fact from Table 11 is that the precision of the estimates
depends on how severe the country was affected by the crises.
    For example, Argentina, Brazil, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Korea, and Thailand were

either the originators of the crises or the main affected countries. The standard deviations
for these estimates is 0.063. On the other hand, US estimates are less precisely estimated.
The average standard deviation is 0.1366. The reason behind this outcome is how the
identification problem is solved; the heteroskedasticity is the identifying device. The quality
of the estimation, and therefore its precision, depends on how large the heteroskedasticity
is. The larger the shift in the variance of that country, the better estimated the coefficients
of the propagations from that country are. The increases in volatility in emerging markets
are almost an order or magnitude larger than those from US (or Singapore) and that is why
those standard deviations are smaller.
    Finally, in Table 12, the quasi-z statistic was computed. Even though the test of signifi-
cance was implemented by looking at the distribution, it is informative to calculate the ratio
between the average of the bootstrapped distribution and the standard deviation because the
conclusions of both procedures are similar, and this one is much easier to implement. The
inconvenience is that the z-statistic tends to overestimate the significance of the coefficients.
    For example, if a 90 percent confidence interval is used (as was the case with the boot-
strapped distribution) then more coefficients are significant using the z-statistic than by
looking at the bootstrapped distribution. In Table 10, there are 32 out of 182 significant
coefficients, while using the z-statistic 47 would have been significant. It is important to

mention that all the coefficients that are significant using the bootstrapped distribution are
also significant using the z-statistic. On the other hand, if a 95 percent confidence interval
is used as the criteria on the z-statistics, then 31 coefficients pass the test. The coefficient
that looses significance is the transmission between US and Peru.
    At a first glance, notice that Chile has as many significant coefficients as USA. Does
this means that Chile is more important than USA in this data? Certainly not. What this
means is simply that those coefficients are estimated with more efficieny. In order to answer
the question of importance of countries, though, a different exercise has to be performed.
The interpretation of the coefficients require a variance decomposition. This is performed
below. This is the right measure to evaluate the relative impact of countries and shocks in
this model.
    Finally, the patterns shown by the coefficients estimated in matrix A imply unconditional
correlations that are relatively large. What are the explanations underlying them? In this
interpretation, it is important to remember that these coefficients are the combination of
several possible channels of contagion. The question is then, what are the possible explana-
tions behind them. Later in this section, a partial structural model is provided by analyzing
the importance of trade and regional variables.

tries’ stock markets to common shocks. These coefficients are identified only up to a nor-
malization and, in this particular case, the US elasticity was chosen to be equal to 0.1. In

    As was claimed in the introduction, the common shocks represent changes in risk pref-
erences, liquidity shocks, etc. Note that all coefficients (except the one from Hong Kong)
are larger than 0.1. Suggesting that emerging economies are more “vulnerable” to common
shocks than the US. For example, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico are close to be 4 times
more vulnerable to the US to the same common liquidity shock. Even though this pattern
is quite informative, it was impossible to reject the hypothesis that the estimates were all
equal to zero. Because of this, instead of studying their aspects, the next subsection turns
its attention to the variance decomposition between idiosyncratic and common shocks.
    As before, the coefficients estimated are difficult to interpret and in the next subsection
a variance decomposition is analyzed. First, the proportion of the variance explained by
the common shocks versus idiosyncratic shocks is analyzed, and later, the proportion of the

                                                52
variance explained by each country within the idiosyncratic shocks is further explored.

Variance Decomposition: Common versus Country specific shocks. The variance
decomposition indicates the relative importance of the common shock in each of the regimes
and countries. Thus, the analysis of vulnerability can also be studied in this context. More-
over, given the interpretation of the common shock as liquidity or risk preferences, this
disaggregation can be useful to understand the relevance of those shocks in the explanation
of the recent crises.
    The variance decomposition was estimated by calculating the total unconditional variance
per regime and compare it with the implied unconditional variance assuming that the com-
mon shocks do not exist. The procedure is as follows: Using the estimated coefficients and
variances in each regime, the unconditional covariance matrix is estimated using equation
(15). Then, the same equation is estimated but Ωzt is set to zero. This is the unconditional
covariance only with idiosyncratic shocks (or in other words, without common shocks). In
Table 14, the ratio between the variance of each country explained by idiosyncratic shocks
only is divided by the its variance when common shocks are included. This procedure is
repeated for each regime.

  Table 14: Variance Decomposition. Percentage explained by the idiosyncratic shocks.
   Three remarks can be extracted from the table. First, notice that USA is almost un-
                                              53
affected by common shocks (surprisingly Venezuela is also equally unaffected by common
shocks). In all three regimes close to 90 percent of the variation in US stock returns is ex-
plained by idiosyncratic shocks. This does not mean that liquidity shocks or risk preferences
are unimportant in the US. What this is saying is that the common component of these
shocks can be described mainly as idiosyncratic shocks to the US. Therefore, in this exercise,
the common liquidity shock not affecting US is the one that is being evaluated.
    Second, the high volatile regime includes a larger proportion of common shocks: the
average decomposition during the high volatility regime implies that 74 percent of the vari-
ation is explained by idiosyncratic shocks. This should be compared with 86 percent which
is the average of the idiosyncratic explaining during the low variance regime. This pattern
is suggestive that during the recent crises there was a common component to emerging mar-
kets that contributed to the comovement across stock markets. As will be seen below, this
stylized fact is even stronger in bond markets.
    Third, during the high volatile regimes the countries that had the largest component of
common shock where the Asian countries. Surprisingly, for the Latin American countries
the change in the common component is small between the low through the high regimes.

Variance Decomposition: Country idiosyncratic shocks contribution. The inter-
pretation of the matrix A coefficients is easier understood in a variance decomposition ex-
ercise. In table 15, we computed the proportion of the idiosyncratic variance of each row
country explained by the column country shock. The total idiosyncratic variance is calcu-
lated as A−1Ω A−1. To compute the contribution of country j shocks on the other countries,
              ε


all elements of Ω except ω are set equal to zero. Table 15 presents the ratio between the
                  ε
                           ε,jj

diagonals of these two matrices, for each country.
    The Table does not include standard errors on the variance decomposition, thus, its
interpretation has to be taken cautiosly. However, it has interesting patterns. The reading
of the Table is as follows: the row country is the variance to be explained, while the columns
indicate the shock that is analyzed. For example, Argentinean shocks explain 68 percent of

the idiosyncratic variance of Argentina, 18 percent of the Brazilean variance, and 19 percent
of the Mexican variance.
    Two remarks are worth mentioning: First, note that in more developed markets (USA
and HK) the mayority of the variance is explained by their own shocks.
    Second, most of the variation per regions is explained by regional idiosyncratic shocks.
For example, 73.6 percent of the variantion of the Latin American countries is explained by
their shocks, 23.0 is due to shocks to Asian countries, and 3.4 percent is the result of US
shocks. On the other hand, 71.0 percent of the volatility in Asia is responsibility of Asian
shocks, 18.1 percent is due to Latin American shocks, and 10.9 percent is explained by the
US. In the particular case of US, 80.5 percent is accounted by US idiosyncratic shocks, while
12.5 percent and 7.0 percent are explained by Latin American and Asian shocks, respectively.

Estimating the importance of trade: The final exercise is to explain the coefficients
from the A matrix by trade and regional variables. Thus, an evaluation of the strength of
these channels of contagion is perfomed in this section.
   The additional data collected is the following: information on trade is obtained from
Feenstra’s World Data Flows. The trade share is computed as the average trade share of
the countries in the 90’s. Information on distance, sharing border, and belonging to Latin

are the point estimates from matrix A and the regression run is the following:

                                                              +         Distance
                                                                     log(          ) +   ε

It is likely that this regression has heteroskedasticity because the A coefficients were es-
timated with different degrees of precision. Therefore, a GLS was estimated where the
covariance matrix of the coefficients obtained in the bootstrapping was used to weight the
regression. In Table 16, the results are shown.

    Note that trade is almost significant and with the correct sign: higher trade share tends
to imply a larger contemporaneous coefficient. The point estimate is 0.33 with a standard
deviation of 0.17. This estimated will be compared with the one obtained in the Bond
regression.
    The estimates on distance are also (almost) significant and with the correct sign. Surpris-
ingly (at least to me) is the fact that the regional dummies are not statistically significant.
The R-squared is quite low even though the F-test shows that the regression is significant as a
whole. Therefore, trade, even though has some explanatory power on the coefficients, it only
has a limitted role in explaining most of the contemporaneous relationship across countries.
Future studies should extend the present analysis to provide a better understanding about
the transmission mechanism across stock markets. This results, however, contrast with the
findings from the bond market; this is the topic that follows.

                                               56
5.2.3 Bond markets
The data on bond markets is restricted to the period between April 1995 until July 1998.
However, the estimation methodology is the same as in stock markets. In Figure 2, the
volatile regimes are shown (determined with the procedure highlighted above). In this case,
there are 526 observations in the low-medium volatile regime, 268 in the medium volatile
regime, and 41 in the high volatile regime. Notice, that the high volatilities occur during
the Hong Kong crisis and in June of 1995.22

Contemporaneous transmission mechanism: In Table 17, the results from estimating
matrix A are shown. The diagonal is omitted and the sign of the coefficients have been
changed so they can be directly interpreted as the right hand side elasticities. The table
should be read as before: the row country (Argentina) is contemporaneously affected by the
column country (Mexico) by the coefficient 0.37.
   Those coefficients that are statistically significant at 90 percent confidence are in bold
type. As before, the distributions and the mass below zero are obtained by bootstrapping
using the same procedure as the one described above.

    Several lessons can be extracted from the table. First, again, notice that USA is not
affected by any Latin American country. Observe that not only the coefficients are not
  22
    In June of 1995, the rescue package was under way, and good news about Mexico were released; its
access to international financial markets was renewed. Thus, laugh is also contagious.



                                                57
significant, but also the point estimates are very small. This was not impose in the estimation
procedure, but our priors would have indicated that indeed this should be the case.
    Second, Bond Market participants agree that the two most important countries in the
sovereign bond market are Argentina and Mexico. The bonds from these two countries
are generally used as benchmarks to define prices for other countries. The results from
Table 17 confirm this common wisdom. Mexico affects all Latin American countries in the
sample except for Ecuador, while Argentina significantly influences all countries in the region
excluding Peru and Venezuela.
    Third, the US has an important impact on Latin American countries. This data was
constructed to reflect the country risk premium (in the first stage the indexes were regressed
on US 10 year bond rates). Hence, the fact that the US coefficients are positive and significant
indicates that the country risk premium in these countries increases with US interest rates.
In other words, the pass through on international interest rates is larger than one.23
    Finally, notice that the coefficients are similar to those obtained from the stock markets.
Even though a direct comparison cannot be made because the samples are very different, it
is informative to concentrate in a couple of countries:
  1. For example, the Mexican coefficient in the Argentinean equation is 0.37 here and
     0.23 before. Both statistically different from zero, but not between them. Brazilian
     coefficient in the same equation is 0.33 here and 0.26 before.
  2. Before, Mexico affected significantly Argentina, Brazil and Peru, here the same three
     countries (and other two) are affected. The regularities across the two exercises is
     worth further exploring.

    In Table 18, the standard deviation of the coefficients is shown. Note that even though
the standard deviations of the US equation are quite small the estimates were not statistically
significant from zero. Therefore, the reason for the lack of significance is not the need of

of the estimates.

    In Table 19 the quasi-z statistic was computed. As before, the statistic tends to overes-
timate the significance of the estimates. For example, if a single side 90 percent confidence
interval is used (as was the case with the bootstrapped distribution) then more coefficients
are significant. In Table 17 there are 20 out of 56 significant coefficients, while using the
z-statistic 26 would be significant. Again, all the estimates that are significant using the
bootstrapped distribution, are also significant with the z-statistic. The size of the test is
incorrect, but, if a coefficient is not significant assuming normality then it will not be so
using the small sample distribution.

normalization; thus US was equated to 0.1. In Table 20 the results are shown. The first

    Before discussing the coefficients is important to clarify what is, in this case, the interpre-
tation of the shock z . In this data, the unobservable common shocks are as before changes
                        t


in risk preferences, liquidity shocks, etc. However, these shocks also include shocks to other
countries that are not included in the sample. In particular, all the South East Asian coun-
tries. Therefore, the common shock aggregates all those disturbances, and the coefficient
is the average response of the countries in the sample to those shocks. This implies that,
unfortunately, this estimates cannot be directly compared with those obtained for the stock
markets.
    An interesting aspect in Table 20, however, is that the estimates of all countries are larger
than the US coefficient. Again, it is impossible to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients
are the same to the USA one24, but they share a similar pattern as the ones obtained from
  24
    Remember that the test performed in the table is whether or not the coefficient is different from zero,
not to 0.10.

Variance Decomposition: Common versus              Idiosyncratic shocks. Instead of con-
centrating on the vulnerability coefficients, it is better to compute the contribution to the
variance by the common shocks. The variance decomposition was estimated as before: the
predicted unconditional variance in each regime is computed by using the estimated co-
efficients and variances; then the predicted variance assuming only idiosyncratic shocks is
calculated; and finally, the ratio between these two variances is calculated for each country.
In Table 21 the results are reported.

    The objective of this exercise is to evaluate the relative importance of common shocks
across regimes. Given the span of the data (mainly covering the South East Asian crises)
and the interpretation of the common shocks in the bond market (mainly SEA as well as
liquidity and risk preference shocks) it should be expected that the contribution of these
shocks increases during the high volatile regimes more than in the stock market case. This
intuition is confirmed by the results. In the low regime (excluding US) idiosyncratic shocks
explain an average of 66.49 percent of that variation. During the medium volatility regime,
they explain 53.82 percent. Which reflects a small drop in the importance of idiosyncratic
shocks. In the high volatile regime, the contribution of idiosyncratic shocks fall to 31.44
percent; less than half of their importance during the low volatile regime.
    Additionally, observe that USA is almost unaffected by common shocks. In all three
regimes more than 99 percent of the variation in US interest rates are explained by idio-
                                             61
syncratic shocks. This is in sharp contrast with the emerging market countries, where the
common shocks always explain at least 20 percent of the variation.
    An interesting comparison between the variance decomposition between bonds and stock
markets is that the relative importance of the common shocks in this data is significantly
larger than in stock markets. However, this comparison should be taken cautiously.

Variance Decomposition: Country specific shocks contribution. We repeat the
other variance decomposition performs for stock markets. Again, here we are interested in
improving the interpretation of the coefficients in matrix A by looking at the contribution of
each shock to the total idiosyncratic shock volatility. This is important, because by looking
at the coefficients directly some missleading interpretation could be drawn. For example, in
Table 17, the coefficient from US to Mexico is non statistically significant. Does this means
that US interest rates have no explanatory power on Mexican interest rates? The answer is
no.
    In Table 22 the results from the variance decomposition are reproduced for the bond
market.

Table 22: Variance Decomposition. Percentage explained by each country shock in the total
idiosyncratic shock variance.

   Note that US interest rates explain a sizeable proportion of the idiosyncratic shocks in
each of the Latin American countries in the sample. Indeed, US explains as much variance
in Argentina as in Mexico, even though one of the coefficients is statistically significant and
the other one is not.
   From the table it can be extracted the conjecture that countries that have their exchange
                                              62
rate fixed to the dollar (Argentina and Panama) tend to have larger proportion of their own
variance explained by their own idiosyncratic shocks. This does not seem to be the case for
the other countries in the sample. Additionally, if the variance decomposition is used as a
measure of the pass through of interest rates, these results suggest that countries with strong
fixed regimes have a smaller pass through. Another interpretation is that the pass through is
the same across all countries but the volatility of the fixed exchange rate countries is larger.
    Further research should look at the patterns arising from this estimations and offer not
only theoretical explanations, but more conclusive evidence.

Estimating the importance of trade: The last examination of the data is to consider
the question of how much does trade explains the coefficients of matrix A. The procedure is
to run a simple linear regression where the coefficients are explained by trade between the
two countries, their distance, and a dummy representing whether or not they share a border.
The information about trade is the same as before.
    Again, the coefficients in the left hand side are estimated with different degrees of effi-
ciency, in this regression there exists heteroskedasticity that could produce the wrong stan-
dard deviations. Therefore, from the first step, the covariance matrix of the estimates is
used to estimate a GLS.25
    In Table 23 the results from the estimation are reported.

                                Table 23: Explaining A coefficients.

       First, note that the coefficient on trade is significant and with the correct sign. Moreover,
  25
    If the covariance matrix is not used and a straight OLS is estimated, the point estimates are close to the
ones reported, but the standard deviations are larger. In that regression only the constant is statistically
significant.

                                                         63
notice that the coefficient is 0.449 which is close to the one reported in the stock markets
(0.333). The coefficient on the distance is equally significant and with the correct sign.
One difference between this regression and Table 16 is that here the border dummy is very
significant. However, it seems to suggest that it goes in the wrong direction.
    More importantly is the fact that these three variables explain almost 75 percent of the
variation of the coefficients. This is in sharp contrast with the results obtained from the
stock market exercise.

6 Future Research
The question of measuring contagion is far from answered. Nevertheless, there has been
plenty of research in exchange rates, interest rates and stock markets. The results are not
conclusive, yet, but suggestive: propagations are relatively stable trough time, and trade and
regional variables produce a sizeable explanation of the observed comovement. The results
in this paper confirm these two views. More has to be done.
    There are, however, other aspects of contagion that have not been explored with the same
intensity. Indeed, these are areas in which there exist hope that some of the inconveniences
of the price data can be overcome. Below is a list of what I think are the next set of questions
that the contagion literature has to address (there are in my particular order of importance,
and feasibility to be answered, but clearly this is almost a random order).

Pattern of correlations:      One unstudied aspect of contagion is the pattern of correlations
across different instruments. In particular, on average the correlation among bond markets
returns is twice as large as the one on stock markets, which is doubled the one that exists
among exchange rates.
   As far as I know, I have seen this fact reported in only two papers: First, Kaminsky and
Reinhart [2000] compute the principal components and show that the proportion explained
by the first component is larger in bonds than stock markets. Second, in an earlier paper
with Eduardo Fernandez Arias we reported this finding by just looking at the correlations.
                                              64
As was mentioned in the previous sections if the variances of bond and stock market returns
are different then both the correlation and the Principal Components estimates are biased.
However, the results in this paper confirm this finding. It is the case that the coefficients and
unconditional correlations across bond markets is larger than in stock markets. In order to
provide some evidence I concentrate on Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela which
are in both datas. The correlations among these countries, implied by the unconditional
variance regime are documented in Table 24.

                      Table 24: Unconditional correlation per regime.

    First, note that the correlations increase with the regimes, as should be expected by the
increase in variance implied by the crises. Nevertheless, the correlations obtained in bond
markets are an order of magnitude larger than those from stock markets. Remember, this is
the predicted correlation given the A and Γ coefficients.
    The previous discussion has indicated that common shocks is a sizeable proportion of the
explanation of the changes in the pattern of correlations across time. It is possible that this
is too the explanation for bond prices. That question could not be answered here because the
two data are not comparable, and because it will be beyond the scope of the paper. However,
with the techniques illustrated here it is possible that an answered could be provided.
    Future research should concentrate on developing the theories and empirical tests to
report (give the exact stylized fact) and explain it.
                                               65
Measurement of Contagion: Revisited. Most of the discussion of contagion has con-
centrated on the simultaneous reaction across countries. Thus, it has been the emphasis
in this paper. However, the propagation mechanism could take important lags not fully
captured in the A matrix, but in the φ(L) coefficients.
    Regarding the question of stability the test highlighted in section 3.4 is able to detect for
changes in parameters of the lag variables. However, the measurement of the propagation
mechanism was entirely estimated by the contemporaneous relationship (most papers look
at weekly, 2-day, or daily effects).
    In the model estimated in the previous section, all the dynamics from φ(L) have been
disregarded. There are at least two reasons that justify why the literature did that (and so
this paper): First, the pattern of contemporaneous correlations is puzzling enough (and as I
mentioned above, it continues to be the case). Second, without estimating the simultaneous
coefficients, there is no way of estimating economically meaningful lag coefficients. With
the methodologies highlighted above, now it is possible to estimate the contemporaneous
relationship properly, and a closer look at the dynamics of the propagation of shocks could
be fruitful.
    In this process, reporting the facts and understanding the dynamics become aspects of
the discussion of the propagation of shocks; not only the estimation of impulse responses
play a crucial role, but the definition of sensible statistics over those responses will represent
an important part of the discussion of what should or not be considered contagion.

Prices versus Volumes: A third important topic is that most of the papers in the area
look at prices rather than volumes. The main reason being the easily availability of high
frequency data, of the former, and the almost complete unavailability of the later one.
    There have been some papers, however, that have studied the behavior of quantities
around the recent crises. The three most influential papers in this are Eichengreen and
Mody [2000], Froot, O’Connell and Seasholes [2000], Karolyi and Stulz [1996] , and Stulz
[1999].

                                               66
    Further research in this area is promising. Most of the theories of contagion have strong
implications about trading volumes and investor’s positions. In fact, the implications on
prices are derived from those volume decisions. Looking only at prices misses these rich set
of implications. The main limitation is data availability, but it should be clear that if prices
encountered important econometric problems, volumes will do too.

Is the propagation through the means or the variances? Fourth, the question
whether the shocks are transmitted directly through prices, or the fall in prices reflects
higher volatilities has not been raised with the emphasis it should. The only paper (to my
knowledge) looking at these issues is Edwards and Susmel [2000]. Unfortunately, they have
to makes the necessary assumption to avoid the identification problem. The models here
studied have highlighted the direct propagation of prices, but they could perfectly represent
a reduced form of a volatility transmission model. So far, the procedures emphasized are
unable to disentangled the exact channel.
    From the theoretical point of view, this is an important question. How the propagation
occurs has portfolio, as well as, policy implications. Formally, an extension of Model 1
including lags and ARCH effects is as follows:

the propagation through prices, while B explains the propagation through variances. Because
in the reduced form only conditional covariance matrices are computed, in general, there is
no procedure to separate      A from B .    Future research should develop techniques that could
deal with this question.

Non linearity and distribution free techniques: Finally, even though some of the
procedures here highlighted are not dependent on a particular distribution of the residuals,
most of the papers assume linear models and normal distributions.
    A casual look to the data clearly indicates that either the distributions are not normal,
or the models are non-linear (or both). There have been some attempts to look at extreme
realizations as a way to compare the behavior of the statistical model in this situation with
normal circumstances. See Bae, Karolyi and Stulz [2000], and Longuin and Slonik [1995] for
some evidence. Further research in the area is clearly granted.

7 Conclusions
The empirical question of contagion is one of the most difficult tasks we have encountered in
international macroeconomics in the recent years. The data suffers from the worst of (what
I call) the macro problems: simultaneous equations and omitted variable biases. And, the
data also exhibits the worst of finance: conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity,
non-linearity, non-normality, and serial correlation.
    This paper has several objectives: First, it provides a critical view to the most frequently
used techniques in applied papers of contagion. The first two sections discuss the biases and
inconsistencies that arise in OLS, Probit, and specially Principal Components and correlation
estimates. In those sections, I propose the use of two new techniques that can deal with
some of the problems, but certainly further research should and will continue to improve the
techniques.
is an extension of the Identification through Heteroskedasticity paper to the case in which only conditional
heteroskedasticity exists. The paper will be available soon in my web page. I do not have it yet.


                                                    68
    The second objective of the paper is to use these new techniques in a broad application
of contagion (the original papers concentrated on very special cases, or only simulations).
Section 5 tested for parameter stability and the importance of trade in bond and stock
markets. Two surprising results in this section are; (1) The parameters are stable in stock
market across very different crises, and periods of time. However, the propagation of shocks
across bond markets was not stable during the first quarter of 1995 and during the LTCM
crisis. Both instances represented important liquidity shocks to bond markets. The pa-
rameter instability could be either a change in the coefficient or a non-linearity. With the
current techniques, unfortunately, no answer can be provided. (2) Regarding the importance
of trade in explaining the contemporaneous coefficients, it was found that Trade and regional
variables are (almost) significant and with the correct sign in explaining the stock market
and bond return contemporaneous coefficients. In the stock market, these variables only
explain 6 percent of the variation, but they explain almost 75 percent of the variation of the
Bond coefficients.
    Finally, this paper has discussed, relatively extensively, a list of further areas of research
where new stylized fact, new data, and probably new techniques will have to be developed
in order to provide a better understanding of how shocks are propagated internationally.

where the difference in the estimates is
                                                                   α (1 + α) σ ε

Note that if the variances of countries x1 and x2 are different, then the estimates are also

As can be seen, one of the coefficients is downward biased while the other one is upward
biased.

B Stability test on the reduced form
The structural model is
                                    AX = φ(L)X + Γz + ε
                                       t                 t            t         t



but the stability test is performed on the reduced from residuals:

                            Xt     = A−1φ(L)X + A−1 [Γz + ε ]
                                                         t                      t       t


                                   = Φ(L)X + ν .t            t


                           Aν t    = Γz + ε .
                                            t   t




The question is if testing on the reduced form also is testing for the parameter stability of
the structural equation.
    It should be obvious that if there is a change in A or Γ the test on the reduced form is
detecting them. The question is if changes in φ() can be found too. Assume there is a shift
in the structural coefficients:

                          A1 Xt    =      ( ) + Γ1z + ε for t < T
                                       φ1 L Xt                   t        t


                          A2 Xt    =   φ2 (L)X + Γ2 z + ε for t > T
                                                t                t        t




                                                    75
which imply the following reduced forms

                      Xt   =   A− 1
                                     ( ) + A−1 1Γ1z + A−1 1ε for t < T
                                1 φ1 L Xt                     t               t


                      Xt   =    2 φ2 (L)X + A2 Γ2z + A2 ε for t > T
                               A− 1
                                          t
                                             −1         −1
                                                              t               t




Because, in the VAR we are imposing that the lag coefficients have to be the same in both
samples, the actual estimate is an average of A−1 1φ1 and A−2 1φ2. Denote this estimate as Φ̂.
The residuals from the reduced from, then will be described by:

                      A−1 1φ1(L) − Φ̂(L) X + A−1 1Γ1z + A−1 1ε for t < T
               νt   = −1                          t               t               t


                      A2 φ2(L) − Φ̂(L) X + A−2 1Γ2z + A−2 1ε for t > T
                                                  t               t               t




As can be seen, the residuals of the reduced form are a function of φi. For simplicity assume
that A1 = A2, and Γ1 = Γ2. Then the covariance matrix of the reduced form in each regime
would be

                      Ω1 = Ψ1XtXt Ψ1 + A−1ΓΩz1Γ A−1 + A−1Ωε1A−1
                      Ω2 = Ψ2XtXt Ψ2 + A−1ΓΩz2Γ A−1 + A−1Ωε2A−1
                      Ψ1  A−1 1φ1(L) − Φ̂(L)
                      Ψ2  A−2 φ2(L) − Φ̂(L)
                               1




Note that if the change in the covariance matrix is explained by the shift in φ (for example)
then the change in the covariance matrix is

                                ∆Ω = Ψ2X X Ψ2 − Ψ1X X Ψ1
                                              t
                                                      
                                                      t
                                                          
                                                                      t
                                                                          
                                                                          t
                                                                              




It is unlikely that this transformation of coefficients would be less than full rank. In the
same way that the determinant is not necessarily less than full rank when the coefficients A
and/or Γ change.
