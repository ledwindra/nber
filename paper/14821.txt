Selective Swap Arrangements and the Global Financial Crisis: Analysis and Interpretation

ABSTRACT
The onset of the US credit crisis in 2008, and its rapid globalization induced the FED to extend unprecedented
swap-lines of 30 billion dollars to four emerging markets, and the proliferation of other cross-countries
selective swap arrangements. This paper explores the logic for these arrangements, focusing on the
degree to which financial and trade linkages, financial openness and credit risk history account for
discerning the formation of swap arrangements to EMs. We also study the impact of the formation
of these credit lines on the exchange rate and the financial spreads of the relevant countries. We find
that exposure of US banks to EMs is the most important selection criterion for explaining the “selected
four” swap-lines. This result is consistent with the outlined model, where we show that in circumstances
of unanticipated deleveraging, emergency swap-lines may prevent or mitigate costly liquidation today,
allowing investment projects to reach maturity and providing positive option value to both the source
and the recipient countries. The FED swap-lines had relatively large short-run impact on the exchange
rates of the selected EMs, but much smaller effect on the spreads (measured relative to that of other
EMs that were not the recipients of swap-lines). Specifically, non-swap countries saw an average
depreciation of 0.15% on the day after swap announcement, but swap countries saw their exchange
rate appreciate on average, by about 4%. Yet, all the swap countries saw their exchange rate subsequently
depreciate to a level lower than pre-swap rate, calling into question the long-run impact of the arrangements.

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Press release, 10/29/2008:
“Today, the Federal Reserve, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Banco de Mexico, the Bank
of Korea, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are announcing the establishment of
temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap-lines). These facilities, like those
already established with other central banks, are designed to help improve liquidity
conditions in global financial markets and to mitigate the spread of difficulties in
obtaining U.S. dollar funding in fundamentally sound and well managed economies.
Federal Reserve Actions
In response to the heightened stress associated with the global financial turmoil, which
has broadened to emerging market economies, the Federal Reserve has authorized the
establishment of temporary liquidity swap facilities with the central banks of these four
large and systemically important economies. These new facilities will support the
provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts of up to $30 billion each by the Banco
Central do Brasil, the Banco de Mexico, the Bank of Korea, and the Monetary Authority
of Singapore.
These reciprocal currency arrangements have been authorized through April 30, 2009.
The FOMC previously authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with ten
other central banks: the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Bank of Canada, Danmarks
Nationalbank, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Norges Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss
National Bank.”

I. Introduction and summary
The unfolding global liquidity crisis provides ample case studies of the assertion that
"extraordinary times call for extraordinary action." Our case study focuses on the unprecedented
provision by the FED of swap-lines to four emerging markets. While the FED extended such
swaps lines to numerous OECD countries (described above), these arrangements were extended
(so far) to only four emerging markets. This begs the questions what are the selection criteria
explaining the “chosen four,” and the degree to which these selective swaps accomplished the
goals spelled out in the FED’s press release.
While final evaluation of the impact of these swap-lines require much more data and
longer time horizon, our preliminary results suggests that the exposure of US banks to EMs is the
most important selection criterion. Adding US trade exposure, capital account openness and
credit history of countries to the US banks exposure provides statistically accurate interpretation
of the selected four swap-lines. This result is consistent with the model outlined in the Appendix

1

-- in circumstances of unanticipated deleveraging, emergency swap-lines prevent or mitigate
costly liquidation today, thereby allowing investment projects to reach maturity. Emergency
swap-lines may provide valuable services in circumstances where the realized liquidity shock
turns out to be much larger than the one expected ex-ante. The impetus for “a larger than
anticipated” liquidity shock may come from ‘financial contagion,’ or from an adverse real shock
reducing the expected productivity of the investment. The first scenario is exemplified by deleveraging shocks due to credit crunch and ‘flight to quality,’ affecting creditors that co-financed
investment in EMs. The second scenario may correspond to news about the unfolding deep
global recession, a recession that may cause further deterioration of EMs terms of trade. The
recent challenges facing various EMs reflect a mixture of both scenarios. An emergency swapline prevents or mitigates the depth of costly liquidation today, allowing the investment project
to reach maturity. Swap-lines may also provide valuable positive option value – by averting
massive liquidation today, if things improve by the end of the investment gestation period, the
higher surplus would support higher profits and will reduce the ultimate cost of the capital flight,
possibly enhancing the welfare of both the source and the recipient countries [i.e., the US and the
four EMs].
Our analysis suggests that swap-lines had relatively large short-run impact on the
exchange rates of the selected EMs, but much smaller effect on the spreads (measured relative to
that of other EMs that were not the recipients of swap-lines). Specifically, Non-swap countries
saw an average depreciation of 0.15% on the day after swap announcement, but swap countries
saw their exchange rate appreciate on average, by about 4%. Yet, all the swap countries saw
their exchange rate subsequently depreciate to a level lower than pre-swap rate, calling into
question the long-run impact of the arrangements. A note of caution is in order: as the selective
swap-lines targeted countries with large US exposure, it potentially prevented even a deeper
exchange rate deprecation of the four. Furthermore, only with the benefit of time we would be
able to appreciate the fuller welfare implications of these arrangements.

II. Explaining the Selectivity of the Arrangements
Out of the 27 markets classified as emerging markets in either the FTSE Global Equity index or
the Morgan Stanley Emerging Market index or by the Economist, only four countries received
emergency swap-lines from the Federal Reserve. We considered four variables that may

2

determine the inclusion of an emerging market into the swap arrangements. These are US bank
exposure to these markets, measured by the share of the individual market in the consolidated
foreign claims of US banks in December 2007, the share of a country in total US goods imports
and exports in 2007, the capital account openness of the country as of 2004 (Edwards, 2006
index) and the years since independence or 1800 that the country spent in default or restructuring
(Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008).

Table 1 presents the means of each of these variables for countries that received the swap-lines
and those that did not. Countries that did not receive the swap-lines had a lower share in total US
bank foreign claims (0.6 percent compared to 3 percent for swap recipients), and the difference
in the two means is significant. All the swap recipient countries had the higher shares in US bank
exposures than all the non-swap countries, with the exception of India which had a 3 percent
share. The mean values of share in total US goods trade are also statistically significantly
different between swap recipients and other EMs, but mean values of capital account openness
and credit history are not.

Tables 2 and 3 present results of the probit regressions that estimate the probability of inclusion
into a swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve. Since we have a small sample of 27 EMs out
of which only four got the swap-lines, we run probit regressions sequentially, starting with a
single explanatory variable and then adding more variables. US bank exposure to these countries,
measured by the share of the individual country in the consolidated foreign claims of US banks
in December 2007 alone explains 64% of the variation in the dependent variable. A higher US
bank exposure to a country increases its probability of getting a swap arrangement by 10.44%
(evaluated at average values of regressors). If we interpret a predicted probability of inclusion of
50% or more as an inclusion prediction, then this variable alone correctly predicts 2 out of 4
swap arrangements and 22 out of 23 cases where such arrangements were not made. Each of the
other explanatory variables individually have low predictive power – the pseudo R-squares are
low and the coefficients of each of the variables in columns 2-4 of Table 2 are insignificant. The
high percentage of correctly predicted observations is due to correct predictions of no-swaplines, which are relatively abundant in our sample. The regressions using only capital account
openness or only sovereign default history do not predict a higher than 50% chance of getting a

3

swap-line for any country. This table suggests that US bank exposure is the most important
variable explaining inclusion in a swap arrangement. In Table 3, we sequentially add other
regressors to a regression with US bank exposure as an explanatory variable. In two out of the
three cases with exactly two regressors, the coefficient of US bank exposure remains significant
(columns 2 and 3). In the case in which it loses significance (column 1), the explanatory power
of the regression rises – the US bank exposure and capital account openness together correctly
predict over 92 percent of the cases (3 out of 4 swap arrangements correctly predicted and 20 out
of 21 exclusions from swap arrangements).1 The insignificance of the estimated coefficients may
be due to the small sample size and non-linear relationships between explanatory variables2.
Adding US trade exposure to the regression with US bank exposure and capital account
openness, does not increase the predictive power of the regression beyond 92%. By adding the
fourth variable - the years since 1800 or independence that the country spent in sovereign default
or restructuring (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008) - we are able to predict fully the assignment of
swap arrangements. This result is driven by the high predictive power of US bank exposure.

III. Announcement Effects of the Swap Arrangements
The Federal Reserve’s swap arrangements with the central banks of Brazil, Korea, Mexico and
Singapore were announced on October 29, 2008. Figure 1 plots the CDS spreads of the countries
that received swap arrangements3 and figures 2 and 3 plot the CDS spreads of all other emerging
markets. The black vertical line separates the pre-swap announcement period from the post swap
announcement period. From figure 1, it is clear that the CDS spreads of the countries that
received the swap arrangements fell when these arrangements were announced. However, it is
also clear from the figures that on the announcement, CDS spreads of other emerging markets
fell too. Swap-recipient countries saw on average, a 19.5% drop in their CDS spreads between
October 29, 2009 and October 30, 2009. The average drop was lower for non-swap countries
(15.81% for the entire sample and 16.23% after excluding Argentina and Pakistan). In neither

The correlations between the explanatory variables are not high –a maximum of 0.6.

case does the average change in swap countries differ significantly from that in non-swap
countries (p-values = 0.6).

Moreover, the spreads for most emerging markets had already started declining before the swap
arrangements were announced. Table 4 presents the peak CDS rates and the dates on which these
peaks were reached, for each of the emerging markets. In 20 out of the 25 countries, the 2008
peak of the CDS spreads occurred before October 29, 2008. While CDS spreads remained lower
than their pre-swap arrangement peaks in the emerging markets that received the swap-lines, in 4
emerging markets that did not receive swap-lines, CDS spreads subsequently rose to higher than
their 2008 peak (Hong Kong, Poland, Czech Republic and Saudi Arabia) .

To further test whether the CDS spreads in Brazil, Korea and Mexico changed more than those
in other emerging markets, we look at the pre and post announcement average CDS levels. Table
5 presents the results of dummy variable regressions to test for difference in means4. The sample
period is truncated to August 6, 2008 to Jan 21 2009, in order to have the same number of days
(84) before and after announcement. Pre-swap, non-swap countries’ average spread equaled
332.17 basis points but rose significantly to 630.24 basis points in the period after the swap
announcements. In countries that received the swap arrangements, the average spread was
215.52 basis points in the 84 days before the arrangements were announced, but rose to 338.30
basis points in the post-swap period. The post-swap period average is higher because although
the spreads fell after the announcement date, they remained higher than the pre-Lehman brothers
bankruptcy era spreads. Lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15th, 2008 and our
84-day window begins on August 6, 2008. In the second column of Table 5, we exclude the two
obvious outliers, Argentina and Pakistan, and then the differences between markets that received
the swap arrangements and those that did not are no longer significant. The pre and post swap

4

The regression takes the form:

CDS _ spread = β 0 + β 1 SwapDate + β 2 FedSwap + β 3 FedSwap * SwapDate , so that β 0 = mean
CDS spread for non-swap countries in pre-swap period, β 0 + β1 = mean CDS spread for non-swap
countries in post-swap period, β 0 + β1 + β 2 = mean CDS spread for swap-recipients in the pre-swap
period and β 0 + β1 + β 2 + β 3 = mean CDS spread for swap recipients in the post-swap period.
5

averages of non-swap countries are significantly different from each other but not significantly
different from swap country averages.

While the announcement effects in the CDS spreads of emerging markets are not strong, the
same is not true for their exchange rates. Table 6 presents the results from dummy variable
regressions on the change in exchange rates on the day before the swap-line announcements and
the day after. Non-swap countries saw an average depreciation of 0.15% on the day after swap
announcement, but swap countries saw their exchange rate appreciate on average, by about 4%.
The two changes are statistically significantly different from each other, and the non-swap
countries' depreciation is not significantly different from 0. Between the day before the
announcement and the day of the announcement, the average exchange rate depreciation for
non-swap countries was 1.1% and the average depreciation for swap countries at 1.7% was not
significantly different. Moreover, all the swap countries saw their exchange rate subsequently
depreciate to a level lower than pre-swap rate (Table 7), calling into question the long-run
impact of the arrangements.

Explaining CDS Spreads
We model the CDS spreads of a country as a function of its country risk rating (from EIU), its
reserves-GDP ratio and three global variables that represent the level of liquidity in the world
economy. These include the yield on 5-year US treasuries, the Center for Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) VIX index of stock market volatility and the price-earnings ratio on S&P 100
index. Tables 8 and 9 report the results of unit root and co-integration tests on a balanced panel
of 19 countries and 37 months (October 2004 to October 2007). We did three panel unit root
tests –Levin-Lin –Chu test, Sarno and Taylor (1998)’s multivariate ADF tests and Hadri (2000)
panel unit root tests. There is evidence of unit root in all the variable series in at least one time
series in the panel. The ADF test is unable to reject the null of a unit root for the three global
series. The Nyblom Harvery test for no common trends in the CDS spreads series rejects the
null, indicating that there may be co-integrating relationships.

The results of the regressions are presented in Tables 10 and 11. Table 10 presents the
regressions with the full sample of countries, whereas Table 11 presents results with the balanced

6

panel. The risk rating is included contemporaneously in some specifications and with a lead in
others, to account for the fact that risk ratings are often backward looking. In all the
specifications, reserves/GDP ratio enter with a negative sign, indicating that reserves
accumulation lowers the CDS spreads of countries. This is consistent with our model in the
appendix where the additional reserves may allow a country to avoid costly liquidation and
therefore lower the cost of the probability of default. In Table 10, the full sample regressions
without time effects, every additional percentage point increase in reserves-GDP ratio reduces
the CDS spread by 0.64 basis points on average. In the balanced panel (Table 11), the effect of
additional reserves is smaller, but still significant (Columns 3 and 4 with robust standard errors).
Higher risk rating of the country and greater expected volatility in global markets also implies
higher spreads.

IV. Concluding remarks
This paper studied the unprecedented provision of swaps lines by the FED to four
emerging markets. The evidence suggests selectivity criteria where EMs with large US banks
exposure, sizable US trade exposure, capital account openness and solid credit history are prime
targets of swap-lines. These results are in line with the view that it’s in the self interest of source
countries to engage in bilateral credit arrangements with EMs as long as they have had a strong
track-record in good times. Countries with lukewarm economic track-record in good times
would find that the International Financial Institutions may be the main possible sources of help
in bad times. This is also consistent with the recent willingness of key OECD countries to
expand rapidly the size and the role of the IMF, and with the lukewarm attitude of Germany and
other countries in the core of Europe towards the provision of deep swaps-lines to Eastern
European countries.

Appendix
International reserves and emergency swap-lines
This Appendix outlines a framework explaining the rationale for swap-line arrangements.
The model is extension of the one used in Aizenman and Lee (2007), explaining self insurance
offered by international reserves in mitigating the output effects of liquidity shocks affecting
banks in developing countries. The framework is akin to Diamond and Dybvig (1983) -investment in a long term project should be undertaken prior to the realization of liquidity
shocks.

Hence, the liquidity shock may force costly liquidation of the earlier investment,

reducing second period output.

International reserves provide valuable self insurance in

circumstances when foreign financial inflows deposited in domestic banks of a developing
country are intermediated into longer term investment. The maturity mismatch exposes the
banking system to the possibility that capital flight would induce costly premature liquidation.
This appendix shows that emergency swap-lines may enhance the expected utility of the source
and the recipient countries following an unanticipated large deleveraging shock.
As our focus is on developing countries, we assume that all financial intermediation is
done by banks, relying on a debt contract. We simplify further by assuming that there is no
separation between the bank and the entrepreneur – the entrepreneur is the bank owner, using it
to finance the investment. The time line is summarized in the figure below.
At the beginning of period 1, risk neutral agents deposit D in banks, which in turn use D
to finance long term investment, K1 , and hoarding reserves, R.5 We assume that a sizable share
of depositors was funded by foreign parties seeking to diversify their portfolio by means of
foreign financial investment. A liquidity shock, with the aggregate value of Z for the borrowing
economy, materializes at the end of period 1, after the commitment of capital. A liquidity shock
exceeding reserves induces a pre-mature liquidation of Z - R. Output increases with the capital
invested at the beginning of period one, K1 , and declines with liquidation at a rate that depends

5

Our model follows the tradition of Bryant (1980) or Diamond and Dybvig (1993) in that the source of
liquidity shock lies with the lender, rather than the borrower (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1998). However, our
model assumes away the market equilibrium among lenders (be it the risk of runs or the difficulty of the
decentralized provision of liquidity). Abstracting from the question whether market-based liquidity
insurance is available, we focus on the implication of large adjustment cost—including but not restricted
to the liquidation cost—on the demand for reserves as self-insurance. In a similar vein, no distinction is
made between the private sector and the monetary authorities which maintain the stock of international
reserves.

on the adjustment cost, θ. The liquidity shock is realized from a known distribution. The new
aspect of our Appendix is that, after the realization of the liquidity shock, we add the possibility
of ‘black-swan’ news – an unanticipated adverse shock (with probability p, the future output will
decline at a rate of δ).6 Such a shock may reflect rapid deterioration of the global economy,
reducing the expected future demand for the project.

The “Black-swan" concept was coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -- an unlikely but not impossible
catastrophe that no one seems to plan for.

9

Assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function, the second period output in the absence
of “black-swan” news is
(A1) Y2 = [ K1 − (1 + θ ) MAX {Z − R, 0}]α ; where 0 ≤ θ < 1 , and α < 1 .
Recalling that K1 = D − R , the net capital after liquidation is:

if Z > R
if Z ≤ R

It is convenient to normalize the liquidity shock by the level of deposits, denoting the normalized
shock by z:

(A3)

Z = zD ;

0 ≤ z < τ ≤ 1 , and density f (z ) .

Depositors are entitled to a real return of rD on the loan that remains deposited for the duration of
investment.7 Assuming agents’ subjective discount rate is ρ , competitive intermediation implies
that

⇒ rD = ρ .

Net reserves held until period 2 are assumed to yield a return of r f . We denote the
marginal liquidity shock associated with liquidation by z * , z * = R / D . The FOC determining
the optimal demand for international reserves can be reduced to [see Aizenman and Lee (2007)]:

(A5)

[ MPK1 − (1 + rf )] ⋅ Pr[ Z < R] = θE [MPK | Z > R ] ,

7

The possibility that the outcome of investment is not large enough to meet the promised rate of return is
discussed in Aizenman and Lee (2007). To simplify, we ignore it in the present set up.

10

where MPK1 is the marginal productivity of capital, and Pr[ Z < R] is the probability that the
liquidity shock is below the level of reserves. The expected opportunity cost of holding reserves
is equalized to the expected precautionary benefit of holding reserves.
To illustrate, we consider the case with small shocks to gain the basic insight for the
welfare gains associated with reserves. In the absence of uncertainty, the optimal level of
deposits ( D0* ), and the resultant surplus ( Π 0 ) are:

Suppose that the liquidity shocks are either zero or z0 , with probability half each, and ρ = rf . If

The first order approximation of the expected surplus can be reduced to
(A8)

E[Π ]|R =0 ≅ Π 0 − θ

Liquidity shocks have a first order adverse effect on expected surplus. In the absence of the
insurance provided by reserves, liquidation induces a deadweight loss equal to the adjustment
cost, θ, times the expected liquidation. In a two states of nature case, perfect stabilization can be
achieved by hoarding reserves equal to the liquidity shock: R = z0 D0* ; adjusting deposits to
D = (1 + z0 ) D0* , thereby setting the stock of capital at K1 = D0* . If the liquidity shock
materializes, R would provide the needed liquidity, preventing costly output adjust. If the shock

11

is nil, there would no need to use R. The assumption that ρ = rf implies that the cost of this
insurance is zero. Consequently, 8

(A9)

This simple example suggests that liquidity shocks have a first order welfare effects in
the absence of reserves, and that hoarding reserves can reduce the cost of liquidity shocks from
first to second order magnitude.

Black-swan news and emergency swap-lines

We apply the above model to understand the provisions of emergency swap-lines. To
simplify, we focus first on the last example, assuming that z0 is zero, hence the optimal demand

8

With more than two states of nature, R would be preset at the ex-ante efficient level, providing full
insurance for liquidity shocks below z*, and partial insurance above. While there is no way to insure
complete stabilization, one expects large welfare gain from setting R at the ex-ante efficient level relative
to the case of R = 0.

The expected output falls short of the second period liabilities iff
(A11) (1 − δ p)[ D0* ]α < (1 + ρ ) D0*

Applying (A6) and (A11), the expected output falls short of the second period liabilities iff
(A11’) 1 − δ p < α

If (A11’) holds, depositors expecting that the first to be “in line” will get higher share of their
deposit back will “run on the bank.” The premature liquidation implies that each depositor will
get only 1 − θ pre dollar deposited. In these circumstances, the run on the bank would impact the
depositors’ source country utility by
(A12) − D0* + D0* (1 − θ ) = −θ D0*

Suppose that the depositors’ source country, in order to prevent the bank-run in the emerging
market, would extend a swap-line of D0* , at a contractual cost of 1 + ρ . In these circumstances,
the expected utility of the source country following the “black-swan” news will be:9

It is easy to verify that, conditional of the black-swan news, the recipient country is better off -its surplus following the black-swan news and the bank-run would be zero. Yet, its the expected
surplus with the swap-line is (1 − p )(1 − α ) D0* > 0 . Consequently, the emergency swap-line is a
win-win (i.e., increases the expected utility of both countries) if

To conclude, the swap-line provided by the source country bails out its depositors, sparing them
the penalty associated with the liquidation costs. The swap-lines provide the creditors’ source
country with the option value that, if the adverse shock would not materialize, the source country
would be fully paid. If the adverse shock would take place, the source country would be
α

paid (1 − δ )[ D0* ] . In both cases, the swap-line saved the source country the liquidation costs. If
14

liquidation costs (θ) are high enough, and if the size of the coming “black-swan” shock (δ) is
high enough, large exposure implies that these swap arrangements are a win-win to both the
source and the recipient countries. Our analysis can be extended in several ways, adding the
possibility of ‘self insurance’ provided by international reserves, costly bankruptcies, and other
relevant dimensions.
