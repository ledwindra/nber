Market Evaluations of Banking Fragility in Japan:
Japan Premium, Stock Prices, and Credit Derivatives

NBER Working Paper No. 9589
March 2003
JEL No. G10, G15, G21
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates movements of market indicators of banking fragility, namely, Japan
premium, stock prices, and credit derivative spreads of Japanese banks. Although the Japan premium
in the euro-dollar market seemed to have virtually disappeared since April 1999, credit and default
risks of Japanese banks has not necessarily disappeared. Other indicators show varying degrees of
fragility among Japanese banks in 1998-2001. Banking stock prices continue to slide compared to
the market-wide stock price index. From pricing of credit derivatives, default probabilitie of banks
can be etracted. Correlations among indicators were high both in the first period and in the second
period; Credit default swap (CDS) premium explains Japan premium with a significant, positive
coefficient. The higher the CDS is, lower go the stock prices. Before the capital injection of 1999,
the markets were more sensitive to bank vulnerability and higher premiums were required.

１．Introduction
１．Introduction
The Japanese banking system has been in turmoil since the mid-1990s. Several mid-size
banks failed in 1995, and three major banks failed in 1997-1998. These failures prompted a
major overhaul in bank supervision: The government blanket guarantee was given to all
types of deposits, capital injections to large banks were carried out, and a financial supervisory
agency was established and reorganized, in 1998-1999. After some tranquility from April 1999
to late 2001, the bank vulnerability became apparent in 2002. This paper will investigate how
different market indicators, Japan premium, stock prices, and credit derivative spread, have
been warning vulnerability of Japanese banks from 1998 to 2002. An analysis of credit
derivative spread will be shown to be a most reliable indicator of credit risk of banks.
Japanese banks have been plagued by several problems since the early 1990s.1 First,
the sharp declines of asset prices made many borrowers in the real estate and construction
sectors insolvent. In the beginning stage of the problem, banks continued to lend to these
companies so that they can make interest payments. Even after problems became so large,
banks were quite reluctant to force nonperforming customers to fail. Second, the prolonged
recession, with the growth rate being one percent, produced many more nonperforming
borrowers in many sectors of the economy.

Third, overextended businesses of banks

Previous studies of the bad loan problems, the financial fragility and crisis in the Japanese
financial system in 1990s are vast. See for example Horiuchi (1999a) Cargill (2000), Ueda (2000) and
Posen (2001).

themselves became costly. Many banks had to retreat from overseas operations. Fourth,
Japanese banks traditionally hold equities of their customers and group companies. When the
Nikkei 225 index peaked in 1989 just shy of 40,000 yen, the banks were sitting on large
unrealized capital gains, that helped to boost the capital adequacy ratio standard. During the
first half of the 1990s, the stock prices were hovering at around 20,000 yen, and unrealized
capital gains shrank, but still positive. However, when the stock prices further went down
below 10,000 in 2001, equity portfolio started to carry unrealized capital losses, lowering the
capital adequacy ratio.
As the bank balance sheets have become damaged, the market started to discriminate
against Japanese banks as a whole. Japan premium is a well-known phenomenon. The
premium is the extra basis points that Japanese banks had to pay in the offshore interbank
market to borrow the US dollar market, and to lesser extent in the yen market. The premium
has varied across Japanese banks, and they have also fluctuated over time. Whenever the
Japanese banks were judged to be vulnerable, the market charged the Japanese banks an extra
premium. Japan premium became a topic of conversation in 1997, after Hokkaido Takushoku
Bank failed. Since the government had said that it would not allow any of the major twenty
banks to fail, the Hokkaido Takushoku Banks's failure was greeted by a surprise. The market
realized that some other Japanese bank could fail without much warning.

Peek and

Rosengren (2001), Ito and Harada (2000), Horiuchi (1999) and Hanajiri (1999) regard the
Japan premium as market indicator of investors’ anxiety about the soundness of Japanese

3

banks to show how the markets responded.
Then, two banks became in trouble in 1998. The Long-term Credit Bank (LTCB)
became rumored to be very weak in the market, due to large nonperforming loans. The new
law had to be drafted and passed before the bank was nationalized on (DATE), 1998. Then,
the Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) was declared in December 1998 by the regulatory authority to
be nationalized.
In order to help calm the situation, and strengthen the capital base of banks, the
government decided to inject public funds into banks. In March 1999, 7459 billion yen was
injected as preferred shares and subordinated debts to strengthen capital base of banks. The
Japan premium all but disappeared and many thought that Japanese banks were on the track
to recover. Increasing stock prices in 1999-2000, later known as an IT bubble helped the
banks' balance sheets. But, in 2001-2002, the bank fragility has become the issue again.
First, When one department store, Mycal, applied for rehabilitation, the bank had to increase
its provisioning, because the company was classified only as doubtful. This raised a concern on
the banks' lax standard for classifying loans. Second, deferred tax credit have been counted
toward capital. Provisioning by banks have been made from taxable income, and tax credit will
be given in the following five years if banks earn enough profits to be taxable. Deferred tax
credits now occupy one half of the capital that is counted toward capital adequacy ratio. (See for

4

example Kashyap (2002) 2). Third, stock prices have been declining, and affecting banks'
balance sheet where many equities are held.3
The increase in Japan premium is limited. One theory is that Japanese banks are
now required to post cash collateral for interbank borrowings. Collaterals can be offset against
any losses that may be incurred if a bank defaulted on loan for any reason. Another theory is
that counterparties to Japanese bank interbank borrowings are now confident that even when
a Japanese bank is declared to be failed, the regulators will quickly take over and honor any
liabilities to avoid a cascade of defaults.
In general stock prices reflect also the possibilities of default, as well as discounted
future cash flows. Since stock prices also reflect general conditions of the macro economy, an
appropriate measure of bank vulnerability would be the difference between the change in the
bank stock price and the change in the market-wide stock price index. Our approach of using
stock prices is different from those that used stock prices as one of the indicators to show the
possibilities of default. Sato et al. (1990) was the first that utilized option model to examine
default risk of Japanese banks.4

2

Kashyap (2002) provides a description of the issue, bank capital permitting to include tax.

When middle-size brokerage Sanyo Securities went bankrupt in the beginning of November 1997,
it was the first firm ever to default on the interbank market and brought a crisis. Since then,
gavernment protected all interbank liabilities to avoild such a crisis.

3

The intention of Sato et al. (1990) is not to evaluate default risk itself but the Japanese deposit
insurance scheme and discussion of safety net as an insurance system.

4

5

Another measure of bank vulnerability has attracted attention recently. The credit
derivatives are the instruments for possible default of credits.

The credit derivatives of

Japanese banks have been traded, mainly by non-Japanese financial institutions, and their
spreads over sovereign Japan is a meaningful measure for possible bank failure. Even if
interbank liabilities may be honored, either by collateral or regulator, credit derivative
payments will be triggered. Since default or failure is the triggering event, credit derivative
spread seems to represent the credit risk most accurately among the three indicators.
Credit risk is the probability that a borrower will default on a commitment to repay
debt or bank loans. It is influenced by bank-specific events and economy-wide events. Any
news that affect market and banks will influence perceptions on credit risk. A broad measure
of a bank's credit risk is its credit ratings (see appendix table1). However, credit ratings are
not observable in the daily basis. A more frequent quantitative measure of credit risk is the
credit risk premium. The credit premium measured in this paper is the difference between
the credit default swap of individual banks and that of Japanese sovereign credit.
The contribution of this paper is as follows: This paper examines the relationship
among three indicators that are relevant to measuring health of the banks: Japan premium,
stock prices, and credit derivative spread. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to
analyze systematically behavior of credit derivative spread for individual banks.
Japan premium represents default risk in the interbank market. It is closely related
to risk of bank failure, but a failure may not necessarily result in non-payment of interbank

6

obligation. Either by having collateral or by regulator’s intervention, interbank obligations
may be carried out even in the event of bank failure. This possibility is more likely in
2000-2001 than 1998-1999. Therefore analysis of Japan premium after 2000 is structurally
not comparable to that of 1998-1999, the highest period of Japan premium. Stock prices are
another indicator for bank soundness and profitability. However, unless it becomes too low,
ups and downs of stock prices reflect more of changes in profitability forecasts rather than
changes in perception of default risk. In terms of the reasons described the above, examining
the relationship between the Japan premium and stock price movements that Ito and Harada
(2000) are looking is not useful methodology in recent years.
In contrast, credit derivatives directly measures credit risk. Credit derivative spread is
a best measure of market assessment on how likely a bank is going to fail in a specified time
horizon. Therefore, this paper is unique in its exploiting a good data set in looking at changing
vulnerability of Japanese banks from 1998-2002.5
To anticipate conclusion, we will find in this paper the following results.
(1) Correlation between indicators were much higher than expected not only in the first period,
even in the second period;
(2) Credit default swap (CDS) premium in the JP (Japan premium) equation has a positive

Neal (1996) is the first in explaining the credit derivatives market’s development in the early
1990s in the U.S. In it, it is explained how credit derivatives as new financial instruments for
controlling credit risks is available.

and significant impact;
(3) The sensitivity of JP (Japan premium) with respect to CDS became much smaller in the
second period, confirming that there was some changes in the LIBOR market perception about
the liability protection in the event of bank default;
(4) CDS premium in the stock equation also has a negative and significant impact;
(5) Before the capital injection of March 1999, in the first period, the markets were more
skeptical and increased premiums.

2. Data Description
2.1. Three indicators
Default risks of Japanese banks appear in the three indicators: (1) Japan Premium (interbank
borrowing); (2) Credit derivative (credit default swap); and (3) Bank stock price. However,
each indicator may show different (combinations) of risk. Increased risk of default will raise
(1) and (2) and decrease (3).
Credit derivative is the most direct way to measure credit risk, since it is pricing the
default event. Stock prices reflect the residual values of company assets as well as future
discounted cash flows. Even if the event of failure is remote, stock prices fluctuate due to
changing prospects of profitability, reflecting both market - and economy-wide shocks as well as
individual bank shocks.

LIBOR premium reflect the probability of interbank default.

Interbank default may occur to a solvent bank, if, for some reasons, a bank cannot obtain

8

(dollar or yen) liquidity. On the other hand, interbank liability may be protected even in the
event of bank failure. Interbank credits may have higher priority in repayments than equity
stake holders.
Japan premium became highlighted as an indicator of Japanese banks’ vulnerability
in 1997-1998. Western banks required higher interest rates when Japanese banks wanted to
borrow in the offshore interbank market. The premium was much higher in the US dollar
interbank market. This was thought to reflect the risk that Japanese banks would not be able
to obtain enough dollars to repay the interbank loans, as their bank soundness was questioned
as well as the outright possibility of bank failure. In 1997 and 1998, Japanese banks had to
pay nearly 100bps more than US and European banks to borrow dollar.
When vulnerability of Japanese banks reappeared in 2001-2002, there was no
significant increase in LIBOR rate for Japanese banks. The magnitude of Japanese premium
in 2001-2002 was less than most 10 basis point. However, the low Japan premium does not
necessarily prove that the markets are less pessimistic about Japanese banks this time
compared to in 1997-98. First, weaker banks disappeared from data or exited form the market,
either by withdrawing from the market or by being merged with other healthier banks.
Second, even for the remaining banks, they are required to put up cash collaterals to obtain
interbank funds. Collaterals protect creditors from losses even in the event of counterparty
(Japanese bank) failure. Third, even in the three cases of the Japanese banks failure in
1997-98, interbank obligations were repaid promptly. The western banks may be optimistic

9

about Japanese regulators’ competence and willingness to carry out interbank obligations
promptly.

2.2. Japan Premium
The Japan premium is a premium imposed on Japanese banks' borrowing rate by U.S. and
European banks in the Eurodollar and euroyen market. It reflected counter-party risk based
on the western banks' belief that Japanese banks had higher risk of default. In Ito and
Harada (2000), the Japan premium is defined as the difference between the Eurodollar TIBOR
(the Tokyo interbank offered rate, or the Eurodollar interbank borrowing rate in Tokyo) and the
Eurodollar LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate, or the Eurodollar interbank borrowing
rate in London) since it is viewed that the Japan premium emerged in the Eurodollar market
the most.
It reflects counter-party risk based on the western banks' belief that Japanese banks
had higher risk of default, especially in the dollar market. In particular, the dollar liquidity
was a concern at the time of the 1997-98 crisis. In this paper, Japan premium is defined as the
difference between the interbank euroyen rate quoted by Japanese banks and the average of
the rate quoted by the non-Japanese banks in the euroyen LIBOR samples. The reason we
used Euroyen rate rather than Eurodollar rate is availability of samples. Sample banks are
very limited if Eurodollar market is examined.
Japanese banks use cash collaterals in interbank transactions since 1999 Spring. It

10

is said that default risk might not appear in the Japan premium since then. We define the
Japan premium as the following form;

JPit = LIBOR3M it − LIBOR3M t
where JPit is the Japan premium of bank i , LIBOR3M it is the euroyen 3 month interbank

rate quoted by bank i and LIBOR3M t is the euroyen 3 month market rate at time t .6

2.3. Credit Derivatives

7 8

Credit derivatives are over-the-counter financial contracts that have payoffs contingent on
charges in the credit of a firm. It also reflects default risk. Credit default swap (CDS) are
financial contracts that provides insurance against credit-related losses.
Credit derivatives, the US dollar denominated default swap, are the average of offer
and bid rates posted by brokers at the close of the Tokyo market.9

10

When both bid and offer

The euroyen LIBOR is calculated by the British Bankers’ Association as the average of the yen
interbank offered rates. Although the premium in the dollar market was serious rather than that
in the euroyen market as described in Saito and Shiratsuka (2001), euroyen LIBOR is used in this
paper since the sample Japanese banks in the euro dollar is very limited.

We wish to acknowledge kind help by Mr. SAEKI Nobukazu of Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial and Ms.
KAWAI Yuko of RP Tech for their answering our questions on the structure of the credit derivatives
market.

The market size is based on the officially surveyed statistics, the so-called Yoshikuni Statistics, of
the Bank of International Settlements, presented in Appendix Table 4.

8

Japanese credit derivatives market has started around the beginning of 1998. This was a relatively
late start, however the market has been growing very fast. Most products traded in the market are
credit default swaps. The default swap premium is the cost of a credit risk. The investor who
wants to avoid the risk is called “protection buyer “(risk seller) and pay a premium to be protected in
case of credit event affecting the reference entity. While the protection seller (risk buyer) receives
the premium. Protection seller (risk buyer) has to pay obligations to the seller if a credit event

are missing for day t, then data of day t-1 is substituted in. When one of a bid or an offer is
missing, the value is substituted between observation days so that the bid and offer would not
be reversed. When missing days continue for a couple of days, we eliminated the period form
our samples. However, these days were not observed often since June 1998. The original
data are taken for all days when both offer and bid are shown by brokers. Samples are for the
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (later Mitsubishi-Tokyo Holding), Fuji Bank, Daiichi Kangyo Bank,
Industrial Bank of Japan (later those three becoming Mizuho Holding), Sanwa Bank (later UFJ
Holding), Sumitomo Bank (later Sumitomo-Mitsui Bank), and Sovereign Japan.

11

Credit derivative spread extracting Japanese bank’s provabilities of default risk is;

CDS it = BANK it − JAPAN sovereign t
where CDS it is the credit derivative spread of bank i , BANK it is credit default premium of
bank i and JAPAN sovereignt is sovereign premium at time t .

2.4. Bank Stock Prices
Bank stock price movements relative to market index, the difference between the two, are

There are several specificities in the credit derivatives market in Japan. One is the definition of
credit events. ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions in 1999 clarify credit events, however
“nationalization” of a Japanese bank is not confirmed.

Our sample period reflects the availability of the CDS data since the market has started in the
beginning of 1998.

defined as to express bank's risk of default. The difference would be that;

STOCK it = log( stock ) it − log(TOPIX ) t
where STOCK it is the log difference of bank i ’s stock price and market index TOPIX t at

time t . The movement of specific bank stock price relative to other sectors can be examined.
We construct specific bank stock price excluding other sectors by subtracting TOPIX from
individual bank stock. That is, excluding general movements in the stock market, TOPIX, we
can construct bank stock price movements.

3. Correlation among Three Indicators
3.1. Bank Mergers and Sample Break
Although we cover the period from June 1998 to September 2002, there was a major change in
the scenery of Japanese banking. After mergers of several banks and trust banks, the four
major banking groups emerged. Due to the mergers, some banks are not comparable before
and after these mergers. Therefore we break the sample into two, the First half: from June
1998 to September 1999, and the second half: from April 2001 to September 2002. The big
four financial groups were formed in the aftermath of the 1997-98 banking crisis.
In September 2000, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and Industrial Bank of
Japan established the bank holding company, "Mizuho Holdings, Inc." There are three banks
under the holding company in 2002, the Mizuho Corporate Bank, the Mizuho Bank and the
Mizuho trust and banking.

13

In April 2001, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, Nippon
Trust Bank and Tokyo Trust Bank established the bank holding company, "Mitsubishi Tokyo
Financial Group,Inc." Three trust banks merged in October 2001. The group is dominated by
the commercial bank, and since it did no involve a merger of commercial banks, there is
continuity in the commercial banking part.
In April 2001, "UFJ (United Financial of Japan) Group" was established by the Sanwa
Bank, Tokai Bank and Toyo Trust and Banking. The two commercial banks, Sanwa and Tokai,
merged into UFJ Bank and Toyo Trust and Banking changed its name to UFJ Trust Bank in
January 2002. Sanwa is a nation-wide commercial bank, with emphasis in Kansai region,
plus some international businesses, while Tokai is a bank based in Nagoya region.
In April 2001, "Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC)," was established by a
merger between the Sakura Bank and Sumitomo Bank. This was straight-forward merger of
two competing banks with similar nation-wide branch networks. The two banks were at the
core or respective corporate groups, which have roots in pre-war zaibatsu. In this sense, the
merger of the two banks put pressure on mergers of non-financial corporations in the two
corporate groups too.
These mergers and reorganizations are summarized in Table 1.

3.2. Three Indicators for each bank

14

Three indicators for each bank are shown in Figure 1 (Panels 1-1 to 1-6) for the first period and
Figure 2 (Panels 2-1 to 2-2) for the second period. Stock represents level of bank stock price,
LIBOR (In the figures, LIBOR is denoted by LIBOR 3.) is the Japan premium described in 2.2,

the difference between individual bank’s euroyen 3 month interbank rate and market rate, and
CDS is representing credit derivative spread, credit default premium of bank i minus
sovereign premium as in 2.3. LIBOR in the figures is ten times larger than original level for
convenience.
Insert Figures 1-1 to 1-6 about here
In the first period, three indicators of all six banks show a similar time-series pattern.
(1) Japan premium (LIBOR) shows quite dramatic increase from June to November 1998, and
then decreased gradually April 1999. (2) Credit derivative spreads show a similar pattern, but
peaking slightly earlier than LIBOR and decreased more gradually than LIBOR. (3) Stock
prices had a sharp decline from June to September/October 1998, and then started to recover.
After April 1999, all indicators are more or less calm. (4) Japan premium and CDS basically
disappeared after April 1999, when the second capital injection was completed, except Fuji, IBJ,
DKB seemed have return of high LIBOR in the summer and fall of 1999. The correlations
among the three indicators seem to be fairly high between June 1998 and April 1999.
An examination of these three indicators reveals that the market had discriminated
quality of these banks. The indicators tend to agree on the health of banks.
(1) In the first period, Fuji Bank was regarded by the market as the riskiest among the six. It

15

had highest LIBOR, highest CDS, and most stock price decline. In the second period, Mizuho
was the worst in terms of the stock price change, the peak level of LIBOR (tie with UFJ), and in
the peak level of CDS. (2) The market regarded the Tokyo Mitsubishi as strongest among the
six in the first period and among the four in the second period. In all of the three indicators in
both periods (except in stock price decline in the first period), the Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank is the
best. (3) Timing of the peak in LIBOR and CDS, and also the trough in stock prices tend to
coincide for all banks.

This indicates that a shock to the banking sector was common, but

vulnerability or sensitivity to the shock was different among different banks.
Insert Figures 2-1 to 2-4 about here
In the second period, CDS has increased markedly in December 2001 for all four financial
institutions, Mizuho (spread of up to 204.5), Mitsubishi Tokyo (120), UFJ (192), and Mitsui
Sumitomo (145.5). Stock prices had declined steadily from the spring of 2001 to February
2002. The degree of decline was the most for the Mizuho (72.8%) and UFJ (70.1%), and the
least for Mitsubishi-Tokyo (43.5%).
Insert Table2 about here
The soundness evaluated by the markets did not change even after most major banks
consolidated and formed four financial groups. The Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank has been the best
and Fuji, current Mizuho, has been the riskiest, according to the market.12

The capital ratios of banks disclosed publicly were all above a critical mark of 8% and differences
among banks were not significant. However, market participants might not have trusted these

12

16

3.3. Correlation Analysis
Table 3 presents statistical summary of the levels of stock prices, LIBOR, and CDS. The table
reveals the following characteristics of these market indicator movements. Those banks that
had high CDS values (max and average) in either first or second period tended to have higher
LIBOR (average and max) levels and a sharpest drop in stock prices ((max – min)/average).
The averages of LIBOR and CDS were smaller in the second period except CDS of DKB and
IBJ. The averages of CDS for DKB and IBJ were smaller before their merger, but those of two
banks become larger in the second period. The ranges for LIBOR and CDS were much smaller
in the second period than those in the first period. The standard deviations (“s,d.” in Table 3)
of LIBOR became smaller in the second period, but standard deviations of CDS did not change
over time.
The worst bank in terms of CDS average was Fuji Bank in the first period, and
Mizuho Bank in the second period. The Mizuho is a product of a three way merger of Fuji, IBJ
and DKB. The three banks were the weaker three of the six in the first period. A merger of
three weaker banks turned out to be one large weak bank, at least in the eyes of the market.

numbers. The number included differed tax credit and capital injected by the government in
1998-1999. The adjusted capital ratios were widely circulated by research publications of
investment banks and securities firms as well as academic work. Appendix 2 and appendix 3 of this
paper show that Tier1 capital adjusted for the deferred tax assets (the equity equivalent in excess of
differed tax assets) and preferred shares. Excluding deferred tax assets in Tier 1 capital reduces the
banks’ regulatory capital ratios substantially, especially in 2002.

17

Insert Table 3 about here
Next, correlation coefficients among the three indicators are examined. The stock
prices and credit derivative spread are expected to be negative. This is confirmed in the time
of bank turmoil. However, during the period of IT bubble, from 1999 to spring of 2000, stock
prices of banks rose more than the market average, because banks hold a wide-range of stocks
including IT-related stocks. The CDS, representing credit risk, behaved differently from stock
price movements. The market participants of the credit derivatives were not impressed by the
stock price increases.
Insert Table 4 about here
The correlation of the LIBOR and CDS are shown in Table 5. The correlation is
expected to be positive, as both represent the vulnerability of bank financial health. This
prediction is confirmed in the data.
The correlation coefficient in the first period is uniformly higher than those in the
second and third periods, suggesting that LIBOR3 represented credit risk more in the first
period. As suggested earlier in the paper, LIBOR3 lost direct relationship to credit risk after
April 1999, because either collaterals are used or counter-parties believe interbank liabilities
would be honored even in the case of a bank failure.

13

This information is obtained from the hearings we had with market participants. “Collaterals ” do
not mean those under CSA (Collateral Support Annex, which is official transaction based on the
regulation of ISDA), but collaterals here are part of the swap arrangement where the Japanese yen
is used in the swap transactions in order for Japanese banks to obtain the U.S. dollar for a certain
period. The “Japanese premium” is hidden in the interest rates used in this swap arrangement.

13

18

Insert Table 5 about here
Banks that are rated to be weak tended to have higher correlation in the second half period,
especially in the relations of stock prices and credit derivative spread (-0.807 for Mizuho, -0.903
for UFJ, -0.821 for Sumitomo Mitsui and -0.283 for BTM. Long-term credit ratings for Mizuho,
UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui were single “A” that of BTM was “A+” at the end of March 2001.).

4. Panel Analysis
The panel regression is conducted in the following form. Dependent variable is either one of the
following:

JPit = LIBOR3M it − LIBOR3M t
STOCK it = log( stock ) it − log(TOPIX ) t
As an independent variables, we use the following variables; CDS, Call rate and a dummy
variable, where they are defined as follows: CDS it = BANK it − JAPANsovereignt , Call = Call
rate, uncollateralized overnight.14 For the interest rate, we use daily observations of the
overnight uncollateral call rate, data being taken from the Toyo Keizai Monthly Statistics.

We have examined panel regressions with a dummy variable that takes 1 before the second
capital injection, March 1999, and 0 after April 1999. The regression results were almost the same
as the results presented in this paper. The dummy variable was included to control for a possible
regime change in bank financial soundness however the regression results are not shown because of
the following econometric reason.
As long as a dummy variable is used in the panel regression, fixed effect model has a bias. For
the level data we use in our regression, fixed effect model is preferable since it brings us the same
effect as the panel regressions in differenced form.

14

19

Both CDS and Call are expected to correlate positively with the Japan Premium and negatively
with the STOCK. Call rate is proxy for monetary policy so that an increase in call rate implies
the tighter monetary policy and liquidity in the market, and it may lead to a higher possibility
of bank failures.
Tables 6-1, 6-2 and 6-3 report results of a panel analysis. The regression results of
OLS, with the fixed effect estimators, are reported in Table 6-1. Stock prices are affected
negatively by CDS, and the coefficient is statistically significant. The Japan premium tends to
be higher when the CDS is higher, and the coefficient is also statistically significant for both of
the periods. In equations (1) and (2), that examine whether CDS, as the fundamental default
indicator, influences stock prices and the Japan premium. The impact of CDS on the Japan
premium in the second period is about one eighth of that in the first period (0.101 for the first
half and 0.013 for the second half). This evidence is consistent with our conjecture that the
Japan premium became very small in the second period, because collateral is used or because
market participants believe that a failure does not imply default in the interbank market. The
impact of CDS on STOCK has increased (larger coefficient in magnitude) in the second period
(-0.0003 for the first half and -0.001 for the second half). In fact, the size effect of coefficients of
CDS in the second period is about four times larger than that of the first period. Stock prices,
representing profitability, is more sensitive to the default risk in the second period. Therefore,
unlike the Japan Premium, the default factor in stock prices has increased in the second period
compared to the first period. The signs of call rate sometimes are not consistent with our

Table 6-2 and Table 6-3 present the results of the OLS, pooled and the random effect
estimators respectively. Most of the results of Table 6-1 carry over to Tables 6-2 and 6-3. The
sensitivity of stock prices to CDS is similar for the first sample period, and they are negative
and significant, and smaller in the first period. That of the Japan premium to CDS is also the
same. It is positive and significant for the first and second period, and much smaller in the
second half.
An important finding of the Japan premium becoming insensitive to CDS is robust
against different methods of panel regression. A conventional wisdom in the market, that is,
the Japan premium lost a value as an indicator of default probability of Japanese banks, is
basically confirmed. However, it is important to stress that the Japan premium and stock
prices do react to changes in CDS that is a direct measure of default probability of Japanese
banks. Although the magnitude of CDS as well as that of the Japan premium has been lower
in 2001-2002, compared to in 1998, this does not necessarily mean that reputations of Japanese
banks have been recovered. The stock and the interbank markets do react to the changes in
the pricing of default risk of Japanese banks, although with lower sensitivity.

5. Concluding Remarks

21

In this paper we have exploited a newly collected data of credit derivative spread. Since it is
suspected that the Japan Premium no longer represents default risk of Japanese banks, credit
derivative spread, CDS, is a more direct, better measure. Examining the correlation between
CDS and stock prices and the correlation between CDS and the Japan premium, it is found
that the relationship between the three indicators are consistent with theoretical prediction.
Higher CDS tends to be associated with lower stock prices and higher Japan premium. This
relationship seems to hold both in time-series, with the magnitude of impact changing overtime,
and in cross-section.

This result is robust with respect to different methods of panel

regressions or the sample period.
One of the salient results of this paper is that the sensitivity of the Japan premium to
credit risk is much lower in 2001-2002, compared to in 1998. This should be an alarm to any
research economist who may want to use the Japan premium data for the period after 2000.
The LIBOR market seems to believe that even in the event of a bank failure in Japan, the
interbank liability will be paid off either by collaterals or by the regulator.

Ratings history data are obtained from the FITCH Ratings, that contains International long- and short term ratings, individual and support ratings.
The below is based on the definition given by FITCH. Long- and short-term ratings assess its general creditworthiness on a senior basis.
The difference between long- and short- is the maturity of obligations. A short-term rating has a horizon of less than 12 months.
Therefore short-term ratings place emphasis on the liquidity necessary.
The individual ratings assess how a bank would be viered if it were entirely independent and could not rely on ecternal support.
Individual ratings therefore are for management of risk, and the likelihood that it would run into significant difficulties.
Support ratings are not about the quality of a bank, but they are the assessment of whether the bank would receive support.
