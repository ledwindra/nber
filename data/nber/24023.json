Using U.S. Census data, we apply two ways of assessing the magnitude of \u201cmissing growth\u201d for private nonfarm businesses from 1983\u20132013. The first approach exploits information on the market share of surviving plants. The second approach applies indirect inference to firm-level data. We find: (i) missing growth from imputation is substantial \u2014 at least 0.6 percentage points per year; and (ii) most of the missing growth is due to creative destruction (as opposed to new varieties).\n\n",
