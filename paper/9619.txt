ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the effects of business cycle volatility on measures of subjective well-being,
including self-reported happiness and life satisfaction. I find robust evidence that high inflation and,
to a greater extent, unemployment lower perceived well-being. Greater macroeconomic volatility
also undermines well-being. These effects are moderate but important: eliminating unemployment
volatility would raise well-being by an amount roughly equal to that from lowering the average level
of unemployment by a quarter of a percentage point. The effects of inflation volatility on well-being
are less easy to detect and are likely smaller.

1. Introduction: The Happiness Cost of Business Cycles1
The focus of macroeconomists on business cycle analysis presumably reflects a belief
that macroeconomic fluctuations entail important consequences for the well-being of society.
However, formal attempts to quantify these costs suggest that they may be small. Lucas (1987)
argues that business cycles present mainly a source of aggregate consumption risk that turns out
to be of only second-order importance. He estimates the cost of this risk to be equivalent to less
than one-tenth of one percent of consumption.
Yet both the general public and many economists continue to argue that smoothing the
business cycle is an important objective. For instance, Shiller (1997, p.36) reports that 80% of
Americans agree with the statement that preventing recessions is “as important as preventing
drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools”. Of these, 83% endorse the
importance of counter-cyclical policy even if “the method of preventing economic recessions had
an absolutely equal impact on economic booms… preventing really good times just as much as it
prevented really bad times.” Professional economists surveyed by Shiller were as likely to agree
with these two statements as the public. (The corresponding proportions are 76% and 84%.)
This paper treads a path between the approaches of Shiller and Lucas. That is, I do not
simply ask people whether they believe business cycles are costly. Equally, I do not assume a
preference structure and make inferences about the cost of business cycles. Rather, I analyze
data on subjective well-being, and compare the evolution of aggregate levels of self-reported
happiness with macroeconomic conditions.
All three of these approaches share a common theme: they explore the extent to which
macroeconomic conditions interact with preferences—standard preferences, expressed
preferences or experienced utility—to induce an aversion to business cycle volatility.
In turn, this aversion to volatility can arise from several sources, although they all share a
dependence on Jensen’s inequality: convexity in either preferences or economic structure drives
a wedge between average well-being in a volatile macroeconomy and well-being experienced
under average macroeconomic conditions. As such, volatility undermines well-being.
The macroeconomic data that I analyze is familiar to most readers, while the use of
happiness data in macroeconomics is somewhat novel. Thus, I start by introducing these data
and outlining the existing literature in section two. Section three establishes that both

unemployment and inflation lower well-being. Section four further explores the effect of the
business cycle on feelings in two national datasets. Section five is the heart of the analysis,
asking whether the data can speak to not only a preference for low unemployment and inflation,
but also low volatility. Section six concludes.
To preview my findings, I find compelling evidence that unemployment and inflation
both undermine well-being. People are much more averse to unemployment than inflation, and
even with a moderate sacrifice ratio, it is a close call as to whether disinflationary policies have
raised or lowered well-being. I find evidence that volatility in the real economy has important
consequences. Current levels of aggregate unemployment volatility probably reduce well-being
by an amount equivalent to raising average unemployment by a quarter of a percentage point.
While I find some suggestive evidence that inflation volatility is costly, the evidence on this
point is less clear.

2. Background: Subjective Well-being in Macroeconomics
Analysis of subjective well-being remains somewhat on the periphery of modern
economics, presumably reflecting the deep grounding of our discipline in revealed preference.
Nonetheless, economic analysis of feelings may still be useful for at least three reasons. First,
feelings may enter directly into the utility function, and as such are an object of direct interest.
Second, feelings may help predict behavior. And third, it may be that asking people how they
feel is a more direct way to do welfare economics than to make inferences based on their
consumption patterns.
Data on feelings of well-being are collected from several large-scale surveys that ask
questions including the following:
•

“Taking all things together, how would you say things are these days—would you say you’re
very happy, fairly happy, or not too happy these days?” [Eurobarometer 1975-1986]

•

“On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied
with the life you lead?” [Eurobarometer 1973-1998]

•

“Taken all together, how would you say things are these days—would you say that you are
very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” [General Social Survey: 1972-1998]

•

“Have you recently been feeling reasonably happy, all things considered?” [British
Household Panel Study: 1991-2000]

2

While life satisfaction and happiness are somewhat different concepts, responses are
highly correlated and hence these concepts are typically joined under the broader rubric of
“subjective well-being”. A host of validation studies have suggested that these questions reveal
something meaningful and can indeed be interpreted as reflecting levels of well-being. For
instance, those who report being happier are typically rated by others as happier, and tend to
smile and laugh more. Self-reported happiness also correlates with both heart rate and electrical
activity in the brain. Measures of subjective well-being have relatively high test-retest
correlations, similar microeconometric structure across time and space, and are highly correlated
with related questions. Diener (1984) provides a useful review of psychometric analysis of the
validity of these data. Bruno and Frey (2002) provide an interesting survey of recent happiness
research within economics.
In his seminal 1974 paper, Richard Easterlin asked whether economic growth led to
rising happiness. Analyzing time series data in both the US and Japan (where average incomes
grew by a factor of two and six, respectively, since the war), he finds that raising the income of
all does not raise the happiness of all. Updates to this work in 1995 and 1996 confirm these
results. This is to be contrasted with the finding that within a society, those who are richer tend
to report being happier. Easterlin reconciles these two results by reference to Duesenberry’s
(1949) relative income hypothesis: what matters is keeping up with the Joneses, and on average
economic growth only makes you rich at the same rates as it does the Joneses. This leads to not
only a different concept of welfare (Boskin and Sheshinski, 1978), but also presents a challenge
to the efficacy of standard macroeconomic policy.
However, the largest cross-national comparisons of happiness data—by Inglehart and
Klingemann (2000) and Veenhoven (1997)—find that people in poor countries have much lower
levels of self-reported happiness. These authors argue that well-being is highly responsive to the
satisfaction of basic needs, but almost invariant to income at higher levels of development.
Finally, economic and political institutions also affect happiness, although it is an open
question as to whether these effects are independent of macroeconomic conditions, or mediated
by them. Nonetheless, under this view, establishing the right institutional frameworks is the key
to higher levels of happiness.
This paper takes a closer look at the links between happiness and business-cycle variation
in unemployment and inflation.

3. Business Cycles and Happiness
The most directly relevant analysis of happiness and the business cycle comes from
di Tella, MacCulloch and Oswald (2001). Analyzing a country-year panel, they find that life
satisfaction declines with unemployment and inflation, controlling for country and year fixed
effects. Their work was based on an unbalanced panel of Eurobarometer survey data covering
twelve European nations from 1975-1991. My analysis uses the same survey, but updates it to
cover sixteen countries running from 1973-98 (Schmitt and Scholz, 2002). Thus, I start by
updating these results in Table 1, as described below.
The Eurobarometer happiness question (shown above) was asked only from 1975-86
(excluding 1980 and 1981), while the life satisfaction question was asked every year from 197398, except 1974 and 1996. Overall, this yields an unbalanced panel of 504,581 valid responses
to the life satisfaction question in 274 country-years, and 134,590 responses to the happiness
question over 99 country-years.2 Answers to the two questions are highly correlated, and so
given the greater data availability, my analysis will focus on life satisfaction.
An important technical issue relates to finding a sensible set of units with which to measure
well-being. As only qualitative indicators exist, there are no natural happiness units that
immediately correspond with the textbook “util”. Throughout this paper I analyze four
alternatives:
•

Following di Tella et. al, I simply take country-year averages of well-being, assigning a value
of 1 to the lowest satisfaction category, and with each qualitative increment, add one.3

•

A less arbitrary alternative is simply to code up the proportion of the population who are
“very satisfied” in each country in each year. This has the disadvantage of effectively
ignoring information from movements between “fairly satisfied” and “not very satisfied”,
and also between “not very satisfied” and “not at all satisfied”.

•

A preferable alternative involves a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, I run an ordered
probit regression on a full set of dummy variables for each country in each year. Under the
assumption that well-being is an unobserved normally distributed variable within each
country-year, this maximum likelihood procedure estimates the cut-points between different

sample, and follow only West Germans.

Thus, for the Eurobarometer survey: 1 = “not at all satisfied”; 2 = “not very satisfied”; 3= “fairly satisfied”; 4 =

categorizations, thereby giving these data a more natural cardinalization.4 That is, this
regression estimates numerical values for each qualitative response that are most likely given
the sample proportions in the data and the assumption that the true underlying distribution of
happiness is normally distributed.
The estimated country-year fixed effects capture shifts in the mean of the underlying
distribution over time in each country. Figure 1 shows how the mean of this estimated
satisfaction index varies across countries and through time. The chart also shows the
proportion of the population who are very satisfied, and the two lines show close comovement.
•

An analogous, but computationally more intensive, procedure involves simply estimating an
ordered probit regression directly on the micro data (including as controls a full set of state
and year fixed effects). The intuition underlying this regression is essentially similar to that
above. Standard errors are clustered at the country-year level, and hence should be
comparable to those estimated on the macro data. These results are typically very similar to
those derived using the two-step procedure described above.

4

Thus, this cardinalization derives explicitly from an identifying assumption that well-being is normally distributed
in the population. The estimates suggest that the difference between the median person who is “not at all satisfied”
with their life and the median “not very” satisfied person is about two-thirds of the difference between the median in
each of the “not very” and “somewhat” categories. In turn, this is about the same as the difference between the
median “somewhat satisfied” and the median “very satisfied” person. Figure 2 shows this graphically.

Panel A reports the main regression results. Each column shows a separate regression, and
across all four columns, unemployment lowers subjective well-being. This result is robust across

specifications, and easily meets standard levels of statistical significance. The effect of inflation
on well-being is less statistically robust, but nonetheless, these data suggest that inflation lowers
well-being. Further regressions (not shown) confirm that responses to the happiness question
yield a similar pattern of responses.
Given that the dependent variable is qualitative in nature, one must take care in interpreting
these magnitudes. Columns 3 and 4 are interpretable roughly as “effect sizes”: the effects of
macroeconomic variables on happiness are measured by scaling by the standard deviation of the
happiness distribution. Thus, if unemployment were to rise by 10 percentage points, average
levels of happiness decline by about 0.35 standard deviations. Figure 2 shows the intuition
underlying these estimates.

Distribution of Happiness Under 3 Scenarios
Source: Author’s calculations based on results in column 4 of table 1.

The bell curve A shows the (assumed) standard normal distribution of happiness in the
population, and the estimated cut-points reflect the most likely categorization of respondents into
“very”, “fairly”, “not very” or “not at all” satisfied with their life, given observed proportions in
the data. Unemployment shifts this distribution leftward, and curve B shows the distribution
when unemployment is 10 percentage points higher. Curve C shows this distribution if both
unemployment and inflation are 10 percentage points higher. Reflecting the estimated
8

coefficients on unemployment and inflation of 3.5 and 0.7, these curves are shifted left 0.35 and
a further 0.07 standard deviations, respectively. To see that these are large effects, note that the
median person in scenario B is as happy as the person at the 36th percentile in scenario A.
Similarly, the median person in scenario C is as happy as the person at the 33rd percentile in the
happiness distribution in scenario A.
While Figure 2 provides a useful metric for interpreting the results specifically in column
4, the scaling is also roughly similar for the results in column 3. Panel B reports an alternative
metric that is also comparable with results in the second column: changes in the predicted share
of the population who are “very satisfied”. (These are marginal effects, evaluated at the mean.)
On average, 28% of the population is “very satisfied” with their lives. Raising inflation by ten
percentage points lowers this number by around two percentage points, while raising
unemployment by ten percentage points lowers the proportion “very satisfied” by around twelve
percentage points.
The ratio of the coefficients on unemployment and inflation—shown in the third row—
gives some sense of how the public feels about the unemployment-inflation trade-off. Whereas
di Tella, Oswald and MacCulloch had found the public to be indifferent between raising
unemployment for a year by one percentage point and raising inflation by 1.7 percentage points,
this larger sample suggests that the inflation-unemployment trade-off is closer to five to one.
That is, the public appears to be extremely averse to unemployment.
These results can be used to speculate about the effects of disinflation on well-being.
Feldstein (1997, p.123) has claimed a widespread professional consensus that inflation has
important adverse effects and that “these adverse effects justify the sacrifices in employment and
output that are generally needed to reduce inflation.” These well-being data give a new way to
evaluate these costs and benefits.
Consider a central bank trying to decide whether to reduce inflation by one percentage
point. The costs of such a policy derive from estimates of the sacrifice ratio, often drawn from
estimates of the slope of the short-run Phillips Curve. These estimates suggest that the cost of
such a policy is that unemployment must be kept above its equilibrium level by two percentage
points for a year. The benefits of this temporary contraction are assumed to be permanent, and
hence assuming a discount rate of 6 percent, permanently reducing inflation by 1 percentage
point has a present value equivalent to 16-percentage point-years of lower inflation. Would the
public be willing to trade 2 percent-years of higher unemployment for 16 percent-years of lower
inflation?
9

The preferences over inflation and unemployment described in Table 1 suggest that this
is a close call. If the effect on unemployment is temporary and the effect on inflation permanent,
then disinflation probably enhances well-being. However, if the rise in unemployment following
a monetary contraction is not completely transitory (as suggested by Ball 1997 or Blanchard and
Wolfers, 2000), or the decline in inflation is not completely persistent, then disinflation probably
lowers well-being. Indeed, the results in Table 1, when interpreted jointly with evidence of
heterogeneous and persistent costs of disinflation (Ball 1994, Ball 1997) suggest that, for some
countries, disinflation almost certainly undermines well-being.
4. Further Evidence on Well-being and Unemployment
Several other data sources shed additional light on the well-being costs of unemployment.
In particular, the British Household Panel Survey allows one to draw a richer portrait. This
survey—similar in structure to the PSID—started tracking around 10,000 Britons in 1991. Of
particular note, each respondent was asked to submit to a psychological test each year. This test,
called the GHQ-12 (General Health Questionnaire), consists of a battery of twelve questions
originally developed as a screening instrument for psychiatric illness, but increasingly used as an
indicator of psycho-social well-being.
Each of the GHQ-12 questions is shown in Table 2. The first column also reports the
proportion of respondents who state that their well-being on that particular measure is less than
usual.6 Typically, about 10-20% of the population exhibits each “symptom” on any specific
question.
These data were matched to regional unemployment data from both the labor force
survey and claimant counts. Unfortunately, consistent regional inflation indicators are not
available. In order to test for the influence of the business cycle on well-being, I ran ordered
probit regressions of well-being on the regional unemployment rate, controlling for region and
year fixed effects. The second column of Table 2 shows results where the independent variable
is the claimant count measure of unemployment, while the third column analyzes the survey
measure. The fourth and fifth columns report these estimates as marginal effects, showing the
implied effect of higher unemployment on the share of people reporting that they are unwell.

6

Responses were recoded so that higher numbers denote greater well-being. For questions regarding capabilities
(A, C, D, G, H, L): 1 = much less; 2= less so; 3 = same as usual; 4 = more than usual. For questions regarding
limitations (B, E, F, I, K): 1 = much more; 2 = rather more; 3 = no more than usual; 4 = not at all.

It is worth emphasizing that these results reflect aggregate movements. Thus, the
interpretation is that a rise in unemployment in a region lowers average feelings of usefulness,
confidence and happiness, and raises depression and feelings of worthlessness in that region.
Finally, Table 3 turns to data from the US General Social Survey to show that statespecific economic downturns also undermine happiness in the US. I regress happiness on two
alternative measures of state labor market conditions: the CPS unemployment rate, and a
measure constructed as the deviation of (log) non-farm payrolls in that state from a HodrickPrescott filtered state trend (described in Wolfers 2002). As in the tables above, I show both the
coefficients from an ordered probit, and the corresponding marginal effects. In this case, the
marginal effects shown are for the percent “very happy”.

Beyond the effects on happiness, Table 3 also shows that economic downturns undermine
public confidence in political and economic institutions. Intriguingly, the effects on faith in large
companies, banks and financial institutions and even education are larger than those on political
institutions such as the President and Congress.7
5. Are People Averse to Economic Fluctuations?
Results in the previous sections suggest that both inflation and unemployment undermine
well-being, that these effects are reflected in many different domains, and that unemployment
undermines public confidence in economic and political institutions. In this section I turn to
examining the effects of macroeconomic volatility on well-being. The preceding results do not
speak directly to this issue: it may be that the benefit of a boom exactly offsets the costs of a
downturn, and hence the business cycle does not affect average levels of well-being. Costs of
macroeconomic volatility arise due to either convexity in the structure of the economy, or
convexity in preferences. Without this convexity, the gain to well-being in a boom offsets the
loss in a recession.
Examples of convexities in economic structure include non-linearities in the short-run
Phillips curve (Debelle and Laxton, 1997), investment irreversibilities (Bernanke 1983), shortrun quasi-fixity in production (Ramey and Ramey 1991), and the choice of high-variance highreturn projects (Black, 1987). Costs arising from convexity in the production side of the
economy can be directly observed in macroeconomic data as reduced output or employment. 8
Examples of papers focusing on convexity in preferences are discussed below. A
common feature of these papers is that the welfare costs attributable to convex preferences are
not immediately observable in macroeconomic data—one typically needs a well-specified
welfare function in order to make any inferences.
Lucas (1987) analyzes the costs of volatility due to imperfect insurance in a
representative agent model. He finds that aggregate consumption risk due to the business cycle
undermines well-being by an amount roughly equivalent to one-tenth of a percent of the

7

Presumably this muted anger at Washington partly reflects the fact that these are responses to state unemployment
relative to the national trend (recall that the regression controls for year fixed effects).
8
Ramey and Ramey (1995) carefully examine the cross-country evidence, and find robust evidence that
macroeconomic volatility undermines growth. Specifically, a reduction in the volatility of output growth equal to
one standard deviation of its cross-country variation translates into growth that is one-third of a percentage point
higher in OECD countries.

14

consumption of the representative agent. Essentially he argues that aggregate consumption
varies too little through the cycle to be of much concern.
By analyzing a representative agent model, Lucas explicitly sidesteps the issue of
idiosyncratic labor market risk. While not denying the important of idiosyncratic risk, he argues
that it reflects “the potential or actual gain from social insurance, not from stabilization policy.”
Atkeson and Phelan (1994) address idiosyncratic risk directly. They argue that the main source
of idiosyncratic risk involves the risk of job loss.
But to see why these effects may be small, consider a highly stylized model, drawing on
Romer (1996, p. 415). Consider the expected utility of a worker who faces the risk that her job is
eliminated next period, which would cause her utility to shift from UE to UU. In normal times the
job destruction rate is s, but a recession may occur with probability p, raising the destruction rate
to s+e; there is an equal likelihood of a boom that will reduce the firing rate to s-e. Thus, the
worker’s expected utility is:
Expected Utility = p[(1-s-e)UE+(s+e)UU] + p[(1-s+e)UE+(s-e)UU]+(1-2p)[(1-s)UU+sUE]
= sUU + (1-s)UE
The first term reflects recessions, the second term booms, and the third reflects times of
calm. Importantly, note that this simplifies to an expression in which expected utility is
independent of both p and e – the likelihood and magnitude of a shock to the job destruction rate,
respectively. That is, dampening the business cycle has no immediate effect on average levels of
well-being in this stylized example. This result reflects the fact that expected utility is linear in
probabilities.
However, the risk of job loss is more highly correlated across individuals when shocks to
the job destruction rate are either larger or more common. That is, the probability that both a
worker and her husband lose their jobs at the same time is higher when macroeconomic volatility
is greater. Consequently, the ability of husband and wife to insure each other against job loss
declines with macroeconomic volatility, undermining average well-being. This same logic
extends to other forms of intra-temporal pooling of idiosyncratic risk. (Formally, this arises
because pooled income is not linear in the probability of job loss.)
Romer (1996) notes that beyond consumption volatility, cyclical variability of hours
worked is much larger than that of consumption, and this may pose major welfare costs. A
competitive labor market equilibrium achieves an efficient allocation. Hence, recessions may
drive the marginal rate of substitution between labor and leisure below the marginal product of
labor; booms potentially cause the reverse misallocation, with the marginal product below the
15

value of leisure. These costs of volatility accrue even when imperfect competition yields an
equilibrium in which employment is sub-optimally low. Figure 3, adapted from Galí, Gertler
and López-Salido (2002), shows that under imperfect competition, booms drive the economy
toward the first best, while recessions drive the economy even further away from the optimum.
Incrementally larger deviations from first best have an increasing welfare cost (the gap between
the supply and demand curves widens), suggesting that recessions undermine well-being by
more than equal-sized booms. These three authors calibrate a model to infer this cost, arguing
that for the US, business cycle volatility yields welfare losses equivalent to about 0.8% of
consumption.

Finally, on the assumption that more volatile inflation is harder to forecast, aversion to
inflation volatility can be motivated by reference to either the redistributive effects of
unanticipated inflation, or to the effects of relative-price distortions resulting from staggered
price setting. (For more on this point, see Woodford 2001.)
16

While the common theme of these papers has been an attempt to infer effects on wellbeing from an imposed preference structure, my point of departure is to treat these well-being
costs of business cycle volatility as directly observable. Thus, I now turn to examining whether
volatility in unemployment and inflation undermines well-being, conditional on average levels of
unemployment and inflation.9 That is, in Table 4 I regress life satisfaction against the standard
deviation of both unemployment and inflation over the past eight years, and also control for the
mean levels of these indicators over the same period:
Life Satisfactionc,t = β Average Unemployment c,t -7..t + λ Standard Deviation Unemployment c,t -7..t
+ π Average Inflation c,t -7..t + δ Standard Deviation Inflation c,t -7..t
+ country c & yeart fixed effects + ε c,t

9

By controlling for levels of unemployment and inflation, I partial out those effects of volatility that are mediated
by higher volatility causing worse macroeconomic outcomes.

See notes to Table 1
Each column shows results from a separate regression with a different dependent variable.
For the 5 country-year observations with less than 8 years of inflation/unemployment data, standard deviation and
mean of a smaller number of observations were used.

The first row confirms that unemployment dramatically lowers well-being, while the
second row shows that volatile unemployment also lowers well-being. Reflecting statistical
imprecision, the results on unemployment volatility are at best suggestive: the estimate is only
statistically significant in the last regression, but the point estimate is relatively large and
negative in all four specifications.
The standard deviation of unemployment over an 8-year period averaged around
1½ percentage points in my sample. Thus, the results in the last two columns suggest that
halving the standard deviation of unemployment shifts the well-being distribution to the right by
18

around ¾%*2≈0.015 standard deviations, increasing the proportion of the population who are
very satisfied by around 0.5 percentage points. By comparison, the gains from reducing the
average level of unemployment by one percentage point are much larger—shifting the wellbeing distribution to the right by 1%*6≈0.06 standard deviations, and raising the percent very
happy by 2 percentage points. Combining these findings suggests that halving unemployment
volatility yields gains in well-being approximately equal to those from reducing the
unemployment rate by one-quarter of a percentage point.
The inflation results are also interesting. As in Table 1, higher average levels of inflation
lower well-being. Moreover, the fourth row suggests that there may be costs to inflation
volatility, with two of the four estimates statistically significant. There is insufficient precision
in these reduced-form estimates to say much about the relative importance of stabilizing inflation
versus unemployment.
Rather than make indirect inferences about the shape of the well-being function, Table 5
directly estimates the degree of convexity in preferences over inflation and unemployment.
Thus, I repeat the analysis in Table 1, but also add quadratic terms in both inflation and
unemployment. (A quadratic functional form is easily motivated in terms of the imperfect
competition model with linear labor supply and labor demand curves, as shown in Figure 3.10)

10

Woodford (2001) provides detailed microfoundations for a welfare function that is quadratic in inflation and in the
output gap.

All four specifications suggest that aggregate well-being is a nonlinear function of
unemployment, and that this non-linearity is statistically significant; the results for inflation are
less clear. Figure 4 graphs these results, showing how well-being declines with unemployment
and inflation, relative to a zero unemployment/inflation baseline.

Wellbeing, Inflation and Unemployment
Source: Author’s calculations based on results in Column 4 of Table 5.

Figure 4 provides clear evidence that increasing levels of unemployment do increasing
harm to well-being. The effects of inflation on well-being are close to linear, and in three of the
four columns, a null of linearity cannot be rejected.
Thus, these results suggest large gains to reducing output volatility, and little or no gain
to reducing inflation volatility. For instance, these results suggest that when unemployment is
15%, the marginal effect of reducing unemployment on well-being is more than quadruples that
when unemployment is 5%. Consequently, if unemployment were to alternate between 5% and
15%, the well-being gained during booms would be less than that lost during recessions. Indeed,
the average well-being in such an economy is equal to that in an economy with a constant
unemployment rate of 11%.
This simple exercise can be taken somewhat more seriously in order to illustrate the
welfare cost of business cycles. The quadratic preferences over inflation and unemployment
shown above can be rewritten as preferences over the mean and variance of unemployment and
inflation, respectively. To see this, note that Table 5 suggests that expected well-being takes the
following form:

21

[
[

]

Expected Wellbeing = E aU 2 + bU + cπ 2 + dπ + e
= a E (U 2 ) − E (U ) 2 + aE (U ) 2 + bE (U ) + c E (π 2 ) − E (π ) 2 + cE (π ) 2 + dE (π ) + e
= aVar (U ) + (aU + b)U + cVar (π ) + (cπ + d )π + e

This allows me to show the results in Table 5 as indifference curves defined over the
mean and standard deviation of unemployment and inflation, respectively.

Indifference Curves: Level and Volatility of Unemployment
Figure 5 clearly shows large gains from eliminating high levels of unemployment
volatility. However, while eliminating high levels of volatility is extremely valuable,
diminishing returns set in rather quickly. Table 6 shows some specific costs of business cycle
volatility – essentially tracking the middle indifference curve. These welfare costs are measured
in units equivalent to the rise in average unemployment that would make workers indifferent
between a specific level of volatility and eliminating the business cycle.

For instance, if through adept macroeconomic management unemployment exhibits a
standard deviation of 2.2% rather than 4%, then we can say that managing the cycle yields gains
in well-being equivalent to those from lowering unemployment by 0.74-0.22≈half a percentage
point. Within my sample the within-country standard deviation of unemployment actually
averages 2.2%. It is quite clear that decreasing returns to smoothing the cycle have set in: the
elimination of the remaining volatility would have an effect on well-being equivalent to lowering
unemployment by only one-quarter of a percentage point (0.22, to be precise).
Note that the estimate of the well-being cost of volatility derived from the coefficients in
Table 4 was somewhat larger: those numbers suggested that one needs only to halve the standard
deviation of unemployment to yield increases in well-being equivalent to decreasing the
unemployment rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The figure above offers a useful partial
reconciliation. The fact that the larger number was derived from a reduced-form estimate is
crucial: an estimated coefficient reflects only local variation in the data. Consequently, the
estimated effect from Table 4 effectively extrapolates something close to the slope of a tangent
to the indifference curve at the mean level of volatility, while the smaller estimate suggested here
reflects the height of a secant to the y-axis. Given the curvature shown in the figure, it is clear
that the slope of the tangent yields estimates of the total welfare effects of business cycle
volatility that are too large. (Alternatively compare the total welfare cost of volatility reported in
the middle line of Table 6, and that implied by the slope – multiplying the top and bottom lines.)
Finally, one can also use Table 6 to speculate as to the value of advances made by
macroeconomic research. Christina Romer (1986) has compiled comparable unemployment
rates series for the periods before 1930 and after 1948, concluding that the standard deviation of
US unemployment may have declined by 10%. This corresponds to an effect on well-being
roughly equivalent to reducing unemployment by one-twentieth of a percentage point.
6. Conclusion
Data on subjective well-being yield several important lessons for macroeconomists. Both
unemployment and inflation significantly undermine aggregate measures of life satisfaction,
happiness, and associated measures of psycho-social well-being. Feelings of depression and
worthlessness rise with unemployment, and feelings of usefulness, confidence, happiness and
satisfaction with life all fall. Not surprisingly, the public’s faith in political institutions, and
particularly the corporate sector, also declines.

23

The relative size of the effects of well-being on inflation and unemployment suggests that
disinflationary policies may have raised well-being in some countries, but lowered well-being in
others. It is a close enough call that the happiness effects of such a policy surely depend on
country-specific circumstances.
Whereas previous research has attempted to infer the costs of business cycle volatility by
imposing utility or welfare functions, the evidence in this paper is based upon empirical
observation of well-being. I find evidence that unemployment volatility undermines well-being,
while the evidence on inflation volatility is weaker, but suggestive. In terms of the magnitudes
of these effects, it appears that there are important returns to smoothing the business cycle, but
that diminishing returns have set in. Further efforts to tame the business cycle might increase
well-being by an amount equivalent to reducing the unemployment rate by a quarter of a
percentage point. Is this large? Compared with previous estimates, such as Lucas (1987), it is
rather large. Compared with the effects of structural labor market reform, though, it is quite
small. Regardless, compared with evidence from microeconometric happiness equations, this is
an important gain—these data tend to suggest that factors like employment and marital status
matter much more for well-being than does income.
