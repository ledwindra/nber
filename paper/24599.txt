The Lifetime Medical Spending of Retirees

ABSTRACT
Using dynamic models of health, mortality, and out-of-pocket medical spending (both inclusive
and net of Medicaid payments), we estimate the distribution of lifetime medical spending that
retired U.S. households face over the remainder of their lives. We find that households who
turned 70 in 1992 will on average incur $122,000 in medical spending, including Medicaid
payments, over their remaining lives. At the top tail, 5 percent of households will incur more than
$300,000, and 1 percent of households will incur over $600,000 in medical spending inclusive of
Medicaid. The level and the dispersion of this spending diminish only slowly with age. Although
permanent income, initial health, and initial marital status have large effects on this spending,
much of the dispersion in lifetime spending is due to events realized later in life. Medicaid covers
the majority of the lifetime costs of the poorest households and significantly reduces their risk.

Introduction

Despite nearly universal enrollment in the Medicare program, most elderly Americans
still face the risk of catastrophic health care expenses. There are many gaps in Medicare
coverage: for example, Medicare does not pay for long hospital and nursing home stays,
and requires co-payments for many medical goods and services. Medical spending is thus
a major financial concern among elderly households. In a recent survey, more affluent
individuals were worried about rising health care costs than about any other financial
issue (Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, 2012).
Several papers (De Nardi et al. 2010, Kopecky and Koreshkova 2014, Ameriks et al.
(2015)) show that health care costs that rise with age and income explain much of the
U.S. elderly’s saving behavior.1 Differences in medical spending risk are also important
in explaining cross country differences in the consumption (Banks et al., 2016) and savings decisions (Nakajima and Telyukova, 2018) of elderly households. More generally, the
literature on the macroeconomic implications of health and medical spending is growing rapidly. Recent studies have considered important questions such as: bankruptcy
(Livshits et al., 2007); the adequacy of savings at retirement (Skinner 2007, Scholz et al.
2006); annuitization (Pashchenko 2013, Lockwood 2012, Reichling and Smetters 2015);
portfolio choice (Love 2009, Hugonnier et al. 2012); optimal taxation of health (Boerma
and McGrattan, 2018); and health insurance reform (Pashchenko and Porapakkarm 2013,
Jung and Tran 2016, Conesa et al. 2017).
All of the aforementioned studies rely on accurate measures of medical risk and medical spending. But even though there is a large literature documenting annual medical
spending at older ages, there has been relatively little work documenting the distribution of cumulative lifetime spending. Yet it is in many ways lifetime totals, rather than
spending in any given year, that are most important to saving decisions and household
financial well-being. The canonical permanent income hypothesis posits that forwardlooking agents base their consumption not on their current income, but on the average
income they expect to receive over their lifetimes. The same logic applies to medical
expenses. Households care not only about the risk of catastrophic expenses in a single
year, but also about the risk of moderate but persistent expenses that accumulate into
catastrophic lifetime costs.
1

Additional mechanisms proposed to explain the “elderly savings puzzle,” or the slow decumulation of
assets in old age, include bequests (De Nardi 2004 and Lockwood 2012) and the desire of older individuals
to remain in their current homes (Nakajima and Telyukova, 2012). See De Nardi et al. (2016b) for a
review.

In this paper we estimate the distribution of lifetime medical spending for retired
households whose heads are 70 or older. Our focus is out-of-pocket spending, the payments made by households themselves. High out-of-pocket expenses, however, can leave
households financially indigent and reliant on Medicaid, the means-tested public insurance
program. Medicaid eligibility depends on financial as well health-related factors (De Nardi
et al., 2012), and Medicaid-provided care is widely viewed as inferior (e.g., Ameriks et al.
2011). Our benchmark spending estimates therefore include payments made by Medicaid,
to capture all of the medical spending risk that households potentially face. Mechanically,
our benchmark estimates measure the medical spending not covered by Medicare or supplemental private insurance. In economic terms, they measure the medical spending risk
that wealthier households would face, and the medical spending risk that less wealthy
households would face were Medicaid not available (absent any other changes in their insurance). We also consider an alternative measure of out-of-pocket spending that excludes
Medicaid payments.
Our main dataset is the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) which has high quality
information on out-of-pocket medical spending over the period 1995 to 2014. Because
the HRS does not have Medicaid payment data, we impute Medicaid payments using
the the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). Ideally these data would allow
us to estimate medical spending directly, by calculating discounted sums of household
spending histories. Unfortunately, even the HRS, which has a very long panel dimension
for a survey of its type, is not long enough to track all 70-year-olds through the ends of
their lives. We thus resort to models.2 Our data allow us to estimate dynamic models of
health, mortality, and out-of-pocket medical spending. Medical spending depends on age,
household composition, health, and idiosyncratic shocks. Simulating our estimated models
allows us to construct household histories, calculate discounted sums, and ultimately to
compute the distribution of lifetime medical spending.
This paper uses the estimated model of De Nardi et al. (2018), which builds on earlier
analyses of the HRS data by French and Jones (2004) and De Nardi et al. (2010, 2016a).
French and Jones (2004) show that medical spending shocks are well described by the
sum of a persistent AR(1) process and a white noise shock.3 They also find that the
innovations to this process can be modelled with a normal distribution that has been
adjusted to capture the risk of catastrophic health care costs. Simulating this model,
they find that in any given year 0.1% of households receive a health cost shock with a

present value of at least $125,000 (in 1998 dollars). That paper abstracts away from much
of the variability in costs coming from demographics or observable measures of health.
De Nardi et al. (2010, 2016a) extend the spending model to account for health and lifetime
earnings, but consider only singles and do not control for end-of-life events (see Poterba
et al. (2017) on the importance of these events). The model used here addresses both
shortcomings by including couples and singles and accounting for the additional medical
expenditures incurred at the end of life.
Closely related papers include Fahle et al. (2016), who document the HRS medical
spending data in some detail, and Hurd et al. (2017), who use the HRS to calculate the
lifetime incidence and costs of nursing home services. Alemayehu and Warner (2004)
construct a measure of lifetime spending by combining data from the MCBS and the
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey with detailed data for Blue Cross Blue Shield members
in Michigan. However, their estimates only distinguish gender, current age, and age of
death – abstracting from health and marital status, among other factors – and for each
of these groups only mean expenditures are estimated.
Of particular note is Webb and Zhivan (2010), who use the HRS to estimate the
distribution of lifetime expenses at ages 65 and above. Our paper is complementary to
theirs, but differs along two dimensions. The first is methodology. While both papers rely
on simulation, our approach is to combine a 3-state model of health (good, bad or nursing
home) with a two-component idiosyncratic shock, and to control for socioeconomic status
with a measure of permanent income (PI). In contrast, Webb and Zhivan (2010) estimate
a rich model of stochastic morbidity and mortality with multiple health indicators and
assume that medical expenditures are a function of these health conditions, along with a
collection of socioeconomic indicators.4 In their framework, all of the variation in medical
spending is due to variation in these controls; there are no residual shocks. In contrast, in
our framework the idiosyncratic shocks capture any spending variation not attributable
to age, PI, health, or household composition. The second major difference between our
exercise and Webb and Zhivan’s (2010) is the spending measure. As discussed above,
the HRS data exclude expenses covered by Medicaid, the means-tested public insurance
program, which otherwise might have been paid out of pocket. Webb and Zhivan (2010)
address this issue by excluding households that receive Medicaid. But all else equal,
Medicaid beneficiaries tend to have higher medical expenses, in part because households
that face overwhelming medical expenses are more likely to qualify for Medicaid (De Nardi
et al. (2016a,c)). Our approach is to impute the missing Medicaid expenditures, using

data from the MCBS, and work with the sum of out-of-pocket and Medicaid expenditures.
To put our results in context, we also analyze the HRS out-of-pocket spending measure.
Comparing the two measures reveals the extent to which Medicaid reduces out-of-pocket
expenditures.
We find that lifetime medical spending during retirement is high and uncertain. Households who turned 70 in 1992 will on average incur $122,000 in medical spending, including
Medicaid payments, over their remaining lives. At the top tail, 5 percent of households
will incur more than $300,000 and 1 percent of households will incur over $600,000 in
medical spending inclusive of Medicaid. The level and the dispersion of remaining lifetime spending diminishes only slowly with age. The reason for this is that as they age,
surviving individuals on average have fewer remaining years of life, but are also more
likely to live to extremely old age when medical spending is very high. Although PI,
initial health, and initial marital status have large effects on this spending, much of the
dispersion in lifetime spending is due to events realized in later years.
We find that Medicaid lowers average lifetime expenditures by 20 percent. It covers
the majority of the medical costs of the poorest households and significantly reduces their
risk. Medicaid also reduces the level and volatility of medical spending for high-income
households, but to a much smaller extent.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss some key features
of the datasets that we use in our analysis, the HRS and the MCBS, and describe how
we construct our measure of medical spending. In section 3 we introduce our model and
describe our simulation methodology. We discuss our results in section 4 and conclude in
section 5.

Data

The medical spending models used here were developed and estimated as inputs for the
structural savings model used in De Nardi et al. (2018). Our description of these models
and the underlying data thus borrows heavily from the text of that project.

2.1

The HRS

We use data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD)
cohorts of the HRS. The AHEAD is a sample of non-institutionalized individuals aged 70
or older in 1993. These individuals were interviewed in late 1993/early 1994, and again in

5

1995/96, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. We use data for
10 waves, from 1995/96 to 2014. We exclude data from the 1994 wave because medical
expenses are underreported (Rohwedder et al. (2006)), and exclude data from the 2016
wave because they are preliminary.
We only consider retired households, defined as those earning less than $3,000 in
every wave. Because our demographic model allows for household composition changes
only through death, we drop households who get married or divorced, or report other
marital transitions not consistent with the model. Consistency with the demographic
model also leads us to drop households who: have large differences in ages; are same-sex
couples; or have no information on the spouse. This leaves us with 4,324 households, of
whom 1,249 are initially couples and 3,075 are singles.
Households are followed until both members die; attrition for other reasons is low.
When the respondent for a household dies, in the next wave an “exit” interview with a
knowledgeable party – usually another family member – is conducted. This allows the
HRS to collect data on end-of-life medical conditions and expenditures (including burial
costs). Fahle et al. (2016) compare the medical spending data from the “core” and exit
interviews in some detail.
The HRS has a variety of health indicators. We assign individuals to the nursing home
state if they were in a nursing home at least 120 days since the last interview or if they
spent at least 60 days in a nursing home before the next scheduled interview and died
before that scheduled interview. We assign the remaining individuals a health status of
“good” if their self-reported health is excellent, very good or good and a health status of
“bad” if their self-reported health is fair or poor.
The HRS collects data on all out-of-pocket medical expenses, including private insurance premia and nursing home care. The HRS medical spending measure is backwardlooking: medical spending at any wave is measured as total out-of-pocket expenditures
over the preceding two years. It is thus not immediately obvious whether medical spending reported in any given wave should be expressed as a function of medical conditions
reported in that wave, or those reported in the prior wave. Our empirical spending model
includes indicators from both sets of dates. French et al. (2017) compare out-of-pocket
medical spending data from the HRS, MCBS, and MEPS. They find that the HRS data
match up well with data from the MCBS. They also find that the HRS matches up well
with the MEPS for items that MEPS covers, but that the HRS is more comprehensive
than the MEPS in terms of the items covered.
To control for socioeconomic status, we construct a measure of lifetime earnings or

6

“permanent income” (PI). We first find each household’s “non-asset” income, a pension
measure that includes Social Security benefits, defined benefit pension benefits, veterans
benefits and annuities. Because there is a roughly monotonic relationship between lifetime
earnings and these pension variables, post-retirement non-asset income is a good measure
of lifetime permanent income. We then use fixed effects regression to convert non-asset
income, which depends on age and household composition as well as lifetime earnings, to
a scalar measure comparable across all households. In particular, we assume that the log
of non-asset income for household i at age t follows
ln yit = αi + κ(t, fit ) + ωit ,

(1)

where: αi is a household-specific effect; κ(t, fit ) is a flexible function of age and family
structure fit (i.e., couple, single man, or single woman); and ωit represents measurement error. The percentile ranks of the estimated fixed effects, α
bi , form our measure
of permanent income, Ibi . Because we study retirees, in our simulations we treat Ibi as
time-invariant.

2.2

The MCBS

While the HRS contains reasonably accurate measures of out-of-pocket medical spending, it does not contain Medicaid payments. To circumvent this issue, we use data from
the 1996-2010 waves of the MCBS. The MCBS is a nationally representative survey of
Medicare beneficiaries. Survey responses are matched to Medicare records, and medical
expenditure data are created through a reconciliation process that combines survey information with Medicare administrative files. MCBS respondents are interviewed up to
12 times over a 4-year period, resulting in medical spending panels that last up to three
years. We use the same sample selection rules for the MCBS that we use for the HRS
data.
The MCBS data include information on marital status, health, health care spending
and household income. One drawback of the MCBS is that it does not have information
on the medical spending or health of the spouse.

2.3

Our Medical Spending Measure

Because the HRS medical spending data exclude expenses covered by Medicaid, which
otherwise might have been paid out of pocket, they are censored. If the incidence of Med-

7

icaid were random, we could simply drop Medicaid recipients from our sample. However,
this is not the case, because Medicaid beneficiaries tend to have higher medical expenses,
in part because households that face overwhelming medical expenses are more likely to
qualify for Medicaid (De Nardi et al. (2016a,c)). Our approach is to use MCBS data to
impute the missing Medicaid expenditures in the HRS, and to then sum observed outof-pocket and imputed Medicaid expenditures into a single cost measure. In addition
to removing the censoring, our measure allows us to assess the spending risk that older
households would face in the absence of Medicaid. Knowing this risk is key to assessing
the effects of Medicaid itself.
We proceed in two steps. First, we use the MCBS data to regress Medicaid payments
for Medicaid recipients on a set of observable variables found in both datasets. This
regression has an a R2 statistic of 0.67, suggesting that our predictions are fairly accurate.
Second, we impute Medicaid payments in the AHEAD data using a conditional meanmatching procedure, a procedure very similar to hot-decking. We combine the regression
coefficients with the observables in the HRS to predict Medicaid payments, then add to
each predicted value a residual drawn from an MCBS household with a similar value of
predicted medical spending. We describe our approach in more detail in Appendix A.
Although our principal spending measure is the sum of out-of-pocket and Medicaid
payments, we also analyze out-of-pocket spending by itself. The extent to which out-ofpocket spending is lower and/or less volatile than combined spending directly reflects the
extent to which Medicaid shields households from medical expenses.

3

The Model

Our model of lifetime medical spending consists of two parts. The first is a Markov Chain
model of health and mortality. The second part is the model of medical expenditure flows,
where medical spending over any given interval depends on health, family structure, and
the realizations of two idiosyncratic shocks.

3.1

Health and Mortality

Let hshit and hsw
it denote the health of, respectively, the husband h and the wife w in
household i at age t. Each person’s health status, hsg , has four possible values: dead;
in a nursing home; in bad health; or in good health. We assume that the transition
probabilities for an individual’s health depend on his or her current health, age, household

8

composition, permanent income I, and gender g ∈ {h, w}.5 It follows that the elements
of the health transition matrix are given by


πi,j,k (t, fit , Ii , g = Pr hsgi,t+2 = k hsgi,t = j; t, fi,t , Ii , g ,

(2)

with the transitions covering a two-year interval, as the HRS interviews every other year.6
We estimate health/mortality transition probabilities by fitting the transitions observed
in the HRS to a multinomial logit model.7
Table 1 shows the life expectancies implied by our demographic model for those still
alive at age 70. The first panel of Table 1 shows the life expectancies for singles under
different configurations of gender, PI percentile, and age-70 health. The healthy live
longer than the sick, the rich (higher PI) live longer than the poor, and women live longer
than men. For example, a single man at the 10th PI percentile in a nursing home expects
to live only 3.0 more years, while a single woman at the 90th percentile in good health
expects to live 15.4 more years. The second panel of Table 1 shows the same results for
married men and women. Married people live longer than singles of the same health and
PI, unless they are in a nursing home, in which case the differences are small.8
Table 2 shows life expectancies for married households, that is, the average length
of time that at least one member of the household is still alive or, equivalently, the life
expectancies for the oldest survivors. While wives generally outlive husbands, a non-trivial
fraction of the oldest survivors are men, and the life expectancy for a married household
is roughly two years longer than that of a married woman.
Another key statistic for our analysis is the probability that a 70-year-old will spend
significant time (more than 120 days) in a nursing home before he or she dies. Nursing
5

We do not allow health transitions to depend on medical spending. The empirical evidence on whether
medical spending improves health, especially at older ages, is surprisingly mixed (De Nardi et al., 2016a).
Likely culprits include reverse causality – sick people have higher expenditures – and a lack of insurance
variation – almost every retiree gets Medicare.
6
As discussed in De Nardi et al. (2016a), one can fit annual models of health and medical spending
to the HRS data. The process becomes significantly more involved, however, especially when accounting
for the dynamics of two-person households.
7
We do not control for cohort effects. Instead, our estimates are a combination of period (crosssectional) and cohort probabilities. While our HRS sample covers 18 years, it is still too short to track
a single cohort over its entire post-retirement lifespan. This may lead us to underestimate the lifespans
expected by younger cohorts as they age. Nevertheless, lifespans have increased only modestly over the
sample period. Accounting for cohort effects would have at most a modest effect on our estimates.
8
The results for couples reported in Tables 1 and 2 are based on the assumption that the two spouses
have the same health at age 70. While our model allows an individual’s health transition probabilities to
depend on his or her marital status, they do not depend on the spouse’s health. Spousal health affects
the life expectancy calculations only in that healthy spouses live longer.

Table 2: Life expectancy of a couple (oldest survivor) in years, conditional on reaching age 70

home incidence differs relatively modestly across the PI distribution. Although highincome people are less likely to be in a nursing home at any given age, they live longer,
and older individuals are much more likely to be in a nursing home. In contrast, the
effects of gender are pronounced, as are the effects of marital status for men. While 37%
of single women and 36% of married women alive at age 70 will enter a nursing home
before they die, the corresponding quantities for single and married men are 26% and
19%, respectively.9 The differences between men and women are largely driven by the
differences in life expectancy and marital status. Because women tend to live longer than
men, they are more likely to live long enough to enter a nursing home. Moreover, although
being married reduces the probability of entering a nursing home, wives tend to outlive
their husbands. Women who are married at age 70 tend to be widows for several years, at
9

These figures depend on the distribution of PI and initial health across men and women. We construct
these distributions with bootstrap draws from the second wave of the AHEAD, using households whose
heads were between 70 and 72 in the first wave.

10

which point they face the higher probability of entering a nursing home faced by women
who are single at age 70. It is not surprising that the two groups face similar nursing
home risk. In contrast, husbands usually die before their wives, so that men married at
age 70 rarely face the high risk of transitioning into a nursing home faced by their single
counterparts. Individuals initially in good health are 2 to 3 percentage points more likely
to spend time in a nursing home than those initially in bad health, as nursing home risk
is higher at older ages, and those initially in good health live longer.
Because all households in the HRS are initially non-institutionalized, our estimates
understate the fraction of individuals in nursing homes at any age. Our simulations begin
with the second wave of the AHEAD cohort, at which point roughly 3% of men and 1%
of women in the simulations had entered nursing homes. However, the HRS does a good
job of tracking individuals as they enter in nursing homes. French and Jones (2004) show
that by 2000 the HRS sample matches very well the aggregate statistics on the share
of the elderly population in a nursing home. We also understate the number of nursing
home visits because we exclude short-term visits: as Friedberg et al. (2014) and Hurd et
al. (2017) document, many nursing home stays last only a few weeks and are associated
with lower expenses. We focus only on the longer and more expensive stays faced by
households.

3.2

Medical Spending

Our preferred medical spending measure is the sum of expenditures paid out-of-pocket
plus those paid by Medicaid. Let mit denote the expenses incurred between ages t and
t + 2. We observe the household’s health at the beginning and the end of this interval,
that is, at the time of the interview conducted at age t and at the time of the interview
conducted at age t + 2. Accordingly, we assume that medical expenses depend upon a
household’s PI, its family structure at both t and t + 2, the health of its members at both
dates, and the idiosyncratic component ψi,t+2 :
h
w
ln mit = m(Ii , t + 2, hshi,t , hsw
i,t , hsi,t+2 , hsi,t+2 , fi,t , fi,t+2 ) + ℵi,t+2 ,

(3)

h
w
ℵi,t+2 = σ(Ii , t + 2, hshi,t , hsw
i,t , hsi,t+2 , hsi,t+2 , fi,t , fi,t+2 ) × ψi,t+2 .

(4)

The variance of ψ is normalized to 1, so that σ 2 (·) gives the conditional variance of ℵ.
Including both family structure indicators allows us to account for the jump in medical
spending that occurs in the period a family member dies. Likewise, including health
indicators from both periods allows us to distinguish persistent health episodes from
11

transitory ones. Finally, we include cohort dummies in the regression.10
While we allow medical spending to depend on PI, we otherwise treat it as exogenous.
This is a common assumption, and it allows us to calculate lifetime expenditures without
solving a formal behavioral model. It bears noting that if households expect to make large
medical expenditures near the ends of their lives, they will save for these expenses even
when they are discretionary. On the other hand, the effects of policy reforms depend on
the extent to which households can control their medical spending. De Nardi et al. (2010,
2016b) discuss this issue in some detail.
We estimate m(·) in two steps. In the first step we regress log medical spending on the
time-varying factors in equation (3), namely age, household structure, and health, using a
fixed effects estimator. Fixed effects regression cannot identify the effects of time-invariant
factors, however, as they are not identified separately from the estimated fixed effects.
To address this problem, we take the residuals from the first regression, inclusive of the
estimated fixed effects, and regress them on the time-invariant factors, namely permanent
income and set of cohort dummies. In the simulations we use the dummy coefficient for
the cohort aged 72-76 in 1996. The level of m(·) is thus set to be consistent with the
outcomes of this youngest cohort.
With the coefficients for m(·) in hand, we can back out the residual ℵ. A key feature
of our spending model is that the conditional variance as well as the conditional mean
of medical spending depends on demographic and socioeconomic factors, through the
2 (·), we square the residuals (the ℵs)
function σ(·) shown in equation (4). To find σ[
from equation (3) and regress ℵ2 on the demographic and socioeconomic variables in
equation (4).
An accurate estimate of the lifetime medical expenditure distribution requires an accurate model of the intertemporal correlation of the idiosyncratic shock ψi,t . Following
Feenberg and Skinner (1994) and French and Jones (2004), we assume that ψi,t can be
decomposed as
ψi,t = ζi,t + ξi,t ,

ξi,t ∼ N (0, σξ2 ),

ζi,t = ρm ζi,t−2 + i,t ,
10

i,t ∼ N (0, σ2 ),

(5)
(6)

In particular we regress log medical spending on a fourth order age polynomial, indicators for single
man (interacted with an age quadratic), single woman (interacted with an age polynomial), both the
contemporaneous and lagged values of indicators for {man in bad health, man in a nursing home, woman
in bad health, woman in a nursing home}, whether the man died (interacted with age and permanent
income), whether the woman died (interacted with age, and permanent income), a quadratic in permanent
income, and cohort dummies.

12

where ξi,t and i,t are serially and mutually independent. With the variance of ψi,t normalized to 1, σξ2 can be interpreted as the fraction of idiosyncratic variance due to transitory
shocks. We estimate the parameters of equations (5) and (6) using a standard error components method. Although the estimation procedure makes no assumptions on the the
distribution of the error terms ψi,t , we assume normality in the simulations. French and
Jones (2004) shows that if the data are are carefully constructed, normality captures well
the far right tail of the medical spending distribution.11
Approximately 40% of the cross-sectional variation in log medical spending is explained by the observables, which are quite persistent. Of the remaining cross-sectional
variation, 40% comes from the persistent shock ζ and 60% from the transitory shock ξ.
In keeping with the results in Feenberg and Skinner (1994), French and Jones (2004) and
De Nardi et al. (2010), we estimate substantial persistence in the persistent component,
with ρm = 0.85.

3.3

Quantitative Approach

After estimating our model, we assess its implications through a series of Monte Carlo
exercises. The simulations begin at age 72 (reflecting medical spending between 70 and
72) and end at age 102.12 Each simulated household receives a bootstrap draw of PI, initial health, and initial marital status from the HRS data used to estimate the health and
spending models.13 The household also receives initial values of ζ and ξ drawn from their
unconditional distributions. We then use our Markov Chain model of health and mortality (equation (2)) to simulate demographic histories for each household, and give each
household a sequence of idiosyncratic shocks consistent with equations (5) and (6). Combining these inputs through equation (3) yields medical spending histories. We generate
1 million such histories and calculate summary statistics at each age.
11

To help us match the distribution of medical spending, we bottom code medical spending at 10% of
average medical spending. French and Jones (2004) also bottom code the data to match the far right tail
of medical spending. Because we include Medicare B payments in our medical spending measure, which
most elderly households pay, for the vast majority of households these bottom coding decisions are not
important.
12
In couples, wives are assumed to be 3 years younger than husbands – the data average – and are thus
initially 69. Single women are assumed to be 72.
13
Although the simulations begin at age 72, we take bootstrap draws from the set of people aged 72
to 74 in 1996. This gives us a larger pool of households to draw from, which should in turn improve the
accuracy of our exercise. We set the initial values of lagged (age-70) health and marital status equal to
their age-72 values, allowing us to calculate medical expenditures made between the ages of 70 and 72.

Results
Unconditional Spending Distributions

Figure 1 shows our model’s implications for the cross sectional distribution of our preferred
medical spending measure, the sum of costs paid either out-of-pocket or by Medicaid.
Costs are expressed in 2014 dollars.
Figure 1a, in the upper left corner, summarizes the health care expenditures of surviving households. Mean and median expenditures are shown, along with the 90th, 95th
and 99th percentiles. The results are dated by the beginning of the spending interval:
the numbers for age 72 describe the medical expenses incurred between ages 72 and 74
by people alive at both dates. Expenditures are expressed in annual terms. The medical expenses of surviving households rise rapidly with age. For example, mean medical
spending rises from $5,100 per year at age 70 to $29,700 at age 100. The upper tail rises
even more rapidly, with the 95th percentile increasing from $13,400 to $111,200.14
Figure 1b shows end-of-life costs, which include burial expenses; the results for age
72 describe the expenses incurred by households who die between ages 72 and 74.15 On
average, end-of-life medical expenses exceed those of survivors. Mean end-of-life expenses
range from $11,000 at age 72 to $34,000 at age 100.
Figure 1c plots our main variable of interest, lifetime expenditures. At each age, we
calculate the present discounted value of remaining medical expenditures from that age
forward, using an annual real discount rate of 3 percent. These lifetime totals are considerable. At age 70, households will on average incur over $122,000 of medical expenditures
over the remainder of their lives. The top 5 and 1 percent of spenders will incur spending
in excess of $330,000 and $640,000, respectively. One might expect the lifetime totals to
fall rapidly as households age and near the ends of their lives. This is not the case. A
household alive at age 90 will on average spend more than $113,000 before they die. The
95th percentile of remaining lifetime spending is higher at age 90 than at age 70. The
slow decline of lifetime costs is due mostly to the tendency of medical costs to rise with
age. Households that live to older ages have shorter remaining lives but higher annual
expenditure rates.
14

In general, our estimated model matches well the distribution of medical spending found in the raw
data. However, the model overstates the 99th percentile of the medical spending distribution after age 90.
Given the low probability of having medical spending in the 99th percentile, along with the low probability
of living much past age 90, this discrepancy should have only a modest impact on our estimated lifetime
spending distribution.
15
We define a dead household as one that has no members. Couples who become singles are classified
as survivors.

14

A number of papers have considered whether medical expenses rise with age generically
or mostly because older people are more likely to incur end-of-life expenses: see the
discussion in De Nardi et al. (2016c). In our spending model both forces are present. The
top row of Figure 1 shows that there is considerable age growth in the medical expenses
of both survivors and the newly deceased. Nonetheless, except for the 99th percentile at
the oldest ages, the end-of-life expenses shown in panel 1b are larger than the expenses
faced by survivors of the same age (panel 1a).
Figure 1d presents the annuitized spending associated with these lifetime totals. For
each household, we convert lifetime expenses into the constant spending flow that would,
over that household’s realized lifespan, have the same present value. The average annuity
payment rises from $9,100 at age 70 to $31,800 at age 100. Comparing panels 1a and 1d
shows that mean annuitized spending at age 70 is almost double mean current spending.
This reflects the rapid growth in medical spending that occurs as households age. The
95th and 99th percentiles of the annuitized medical spending distribution are also higher
than the corresponding percentiles of the current spending distribution. One might think
that those who have high medical spending in the present will usually have lower medical
spending in the future, leading annuitized spending, which is essentially an average, to be
less dispersed than current spending. The wide variation in annuitized spending found
in panel 1d thus shows that medical spending is persistent, and that those with high
spending in the present are likely to have high spending in the future.

4.2

Lifetime Medical Spending Determinants and Medical Spending Risk

The graphs presented in Figure 1 show that the medical costs of older households are high,
rising with age and widely dispersed. A significant portion of this variation, however, is
due to factors that are known to the household (PI, health, marital status, the persistent
shock ζ). The spending distributions that individual households actually face, conditional
on what they know at any point in time, can be quite different.

Figure 3: Distributions of Lifetime Medical Expenditures by Initial Health and Household
Structure, PI = 1

18

Figures 2 and 3 compare the mean, 90th, 95th and 99th percentiles of lifetime medical
spending at age 70 for different values of PI and initial health and marital status. Figure 2
shows results for households at the very bottom of the income distribution (PI = 0).
Lifetime spending varies greatly across the distribution of initial health and marital status.
Some trends are apparent:
1. Women have higher lifetime medical expenditures than men.
2. People initially in good health have higher lifetime expenditures than those initially in bad health. This reflects their longer life expectancies, combined with the
tendency of medical costs to rise with age.
3. Households initially in nursing homes have the highest lifetime expenditures, in spite
of their high mortality. Nursing home care is expensive, and most people – more
than 70 percent of men and 60 percent of women – outside a nursing home at age
70 never have an extended nursing home visit.
Figure 3 shows results for households at the very top of the income distribution
(PI = 1). Households at the top of the income distribution spend considerably more
than those at the bottom, often well in excess of 50 percent more. By way of example,
consider 70-year-old couples where both members are initially in good health. With a
PI rank of 0 these couples would on average spend $104,000 over their remaining lives.
With a PI rank of 1 they would spend over $165,000. Households with higher income may
have higher lifetime expenditures because they live longer, or because they have higher
expenses at any given age. Figure 4, which compares the same two groups in more detail,
shows that both effects are present. The top two panels of this figure compare annual
expenditures for surviving individuals. While high income households typically spend
more each year, at earlier ages and higher percentiles the opposite is often true.
Figures 2-3 show that a significant part of the dispersion in retiree medical spending
can be attributed to health and demographic factors known at the very beginning of
retirement. On the other hand, Figure 4 shows that spending remains dispersed even
after conditioning on these factors. For example, the gaps between the conditional means
and 99th percentiles of lifetime spending shown in Figures 4c and 4d are of roughly the
same size as the unconditional gap shown in Figure 1c.
Another potentially predictable source of spending variation is the persistent idiosyncratic component of medical spending, ζ. The importance of the initial idiosyncratic
shocks can be seen in Figure 5. The two panels in the left-hand column of this figure are

directly comparable to the corresponding columns in Figure 4; the only difference is that
the results in the new graphs are generated using a permanent income rank of 0.5. The
two panels in the right-hand column differ from those on the left in that all the simulated
histories begin with ζ = ξ = 0. This can be seen in Figure 5b, where the distribution of
annual expenses is initially degenerate. Comparing the panels in the top row shows that
the effects of the shocks last for several years. On the other hand, the bottom panels show
that eliminating the initial spending shocks has a relatively small effect on the dispersion
of lifetime expenditures. Knowing the initial idiosyncratic shocks removes little risk.
There are three reasons why the effects of the initial shocks wear off. First, as we
document above, a significant portion of the variation in annual medical spending is driven
by the health status of the household. Second, the transitory component ξ accounts for
a large fraction of the residual variation, and imposing an initial condition has no effect
on future transitory shocks. Finally, the effect of the initial realization of the persistent
component ζ declines with age, as the persistence parameter ρm is less than 1.
The previous results notwithstanding, a large part of the elderly’s medical spending
uncertainty is due to the idiosyncratic shocks. Recall that only about 40% of the crosssectional variation in log medical spending is explained by the observables. Likewise, if we
remove all of the idiosyncratic shocks in our simulations, so that the only uncertainty is
health and household structure, the unconditional variation of lifetime medical spending
is only a fraction of its original value.

4.3

Out-of-Pocket Medical Spending

Our baseline measure of medical spending is the sum of payments made out-of-pocket and
Medicaid. A number of recent papers have argued that Medicaid significantly reduces the
out-of-pocket spending risk faced by older households. Brown and Finkelstein (2008)
conclude that Medicaid crowds out private long-term care insurance for about two-thirds
of the wealth distribution. De Nardi et al. (2016a) find that most single retirees, including
those at the top of the income distribution, value Medicaid at more than its actuarial
cost. While both of these papers model Medicaid formally, as part of the budget set in a
dynamic structural model, it is also useful to assess the program in a less structured way.
In particular, repeating our Monte Carlo exercises with the HRS out-of-pocket measure,
which excludes Medicaid, allows us to compare the pre- and post-Medicaid distribution
of medical spending.
Figure 6 compares unconditional distributions. The two panels in the left-hand column
of this figure show results for our baseline spending measure; the panels in the right-hand

column show results for out-of-pocket spending alone. The first row of Figure 6 compares
annual expenditures for survivors. At age 70 mean out-of-pocket expenditures ($4,200)
are about 18 percent less than mean combined expenditures ($5,100). In other words,
Medicaid covers about 18 percent of the total for 70 year olds. However, at older ages
and higher spending percentiles, out-of-pocket expenditures are considerably lower. The
second row of Figure 6 shows lifetime expenditures. At age 70 mean lifetime out-of-pocket
expenses are about 20 percent lower than mean combined expenditures. This difference
may seem small given the differences in the first row, but end-of-life expenditures (not
shown) are fairly similar across the two spending measures.
Because Medicaid is means-tested, it is most prevalent at the bottom of income distribution. To show this more clearly, Figure 7 compares the annual spending of surviving
households at different points of the PI distribution. Consistent with Figures 4 and 5,
we look at couples where both spouses were initially in good health. The top row of
Figure 7, which compares the two spending measures for households at the bottom of the
PI distribution, shows that Medicaid picks up a large share of these households’ medical
expenditures. At age 70, mean out-of-pocket expenditures are about 45 percent lower
than mean combined expenditures, meaning that Medicaid constitutes about 45 percent
of the total. The share of costs covered by Medicaid rises rapidly with age, however, to
around 85 percent. The bottom row of Figure 7 repeats the comparison for the top of
the PI distribution. Not surprisingly, Medicaid covers a much smaller fractions of these
households’ expenditures.
Figure 8 compares lifetime spending totals. The top row of this figure shows that at
the bottom of the income distribution, Medicaid covers 57 percent of lifetime costs as of
age 70. At older ages and higher percentiles it covers even more. The bottom row shows
results for households at the top of the income distribution. Medicaid covers 21 percent
of lifetime costs at age 70, with the fraction rising to nearly 30 percent at age 100. While
most high-income households do not receive Medicaid, those that do qualify under the
Medically Needy provision, which assists households whose financial resources have been
exhausted by medical expenses. Such households tend to have high medical expenses and
tend to receive large Medicaid benefits (De Nardi et al., 2016a).

Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper we use the health and spending models developed in De Nardi et al. (2018)
to simulate the distribution of lifetime medical expenditures as of age 70, adding to the
handful of studies on this topic. We also assess the importance of Medicaid in reducing
lifetime medical spending risk. The simulations show that lifetime medical spending is
high and uncertain, and that the level and the dispersion of this spending diminish only
slowly with age. Although PI, initial health and initial marital status have large and
predictable effects, much of the dispersion in lifetime spending is due to events realized
at older ages. The poorest households have the majority of their medical costs covered
by Medicaid, which significantly reduces their spending volatility as well. Medicaid also
reduces the level and volatility of medical spending for high-income households, albeit to
a much smaller degree.
The paper closest to ours is Webb and Zhivan (2010), which we discussed in our introduction. Webb and Zhivan (2010) also find that lifetime out-of-pocket medical spending is
high and widely dispersed, and that the level and conditional dispersion of this spending
diminish only slowly as households age. The levels of their estimated expenses, however,
are even higher than ours, even though their spending measure excludes Medicaid. For
instance, they find that 65-year-old couples with high school degrees and no chronic diseases will on average spend about $300,000 over their remaining lives, and 5 percent of
these households will spend well over $600,000.16 We find that 70-year-old couples with
a PI rank of 0.5 and good initial health will on average spend about $150,000 over their
remaining lives and that 5 percent of these households will spend in excess of $380,000.
One likely reason why Webb and Zhivan (2010) find higher medical spending is that
they estimate their model using a pooled cross-section regression. They then correct for
cohort bias – the fact that, for instance, the medical spending of a 90-year-old observed
in 1996 is likely to be lower than the medical spending a 70-year-old observed in 1996
would face when she turned 90 in 2016 – by allowing their simulated medical expenses to
grow over time, independent of age, at long-term historical rates. In contrast, we estimate
our spending model using a fixed effects regression with no time controls, so that our age
effects measure the year-to-year spending growth that households realized over the sample
period. Because medical spending growth has been fairly slow in recent years – and outof-pocket spending was reduced by the introduction of Medicare Part D in 2006 – Webb
and Zhivan’s (2010) assumed growth rates likely exceed recent experience.17 A second,

We inflate their results from 2009 to 2014 dollars – roughly 10 percent – using the CPI.
Webb and Zhivan (2010) assume that the real growth rate of per capita health costs exclusive of

related, reason is that Webb and Zhivan’s (2010) estimates are for the cohort turning 65
in 2009, while our results are for the cohort that turned 70 in 1992. This represents a
more than 20-year gap in birth dates, during which time medical spending rose at every
age.
We conclude by pointing out some caveats to our analysis. We assume, as do many
other empirical papers, that medical spending is exogenous, while in reality it is a choice
variable. Although the demand for some medical goods and services is extremely inelastic,
the demand for others might be elastic. Nursing home care, for example, is a bundle of
medical and non-medical commodities, and the latter can vary greatly in quality, with the
choice between a single and a shared room being just one example. It is also worth noting
that our analysis excludes payments made by Medicare and private insurers. Medicare
substantially reduces out-of-pocket medical expenses throughout the retiree population
(Barcellos and Jacobson, 2015). While the combination of out-of-pocket and Medicaid
expenditures considered here may be sufficient for some analyses, such as studies of household saving, other analyses require that all health costs be accounted for. Extending our
exercise to include all medical expenditures would be useful, and we leave it to future
research.

Appendix A: Imputing Medicaid Expenditures
Let i index individuals in the HRS. Define oopit as out-of-pocket medical expenses,
M edit as Medicaid payments, and mit as the sum of out-of-pocket and Medicaid payments
that we wish to plug in the model. To impute M edit , which is missing in the HRS, we
follow David et al. (1986) and French and Jones (2011) and use a predictive meanmatching regression approach. There are two steps to our procedure. First, we use the
MCBS data to regress Medicaid payments (for Medicaid recipients) on observable variables
that exist in both datasets. Second, we impute Medicaid payments in the HRS data using
a conditional mean-matching procedure, a procedure very similar to hot-decking.
First Step Estimation Procedure
Let j index individuals in the MCBS. For the subsample of the MCBS with a positive
Medicaid indicator (i.e., a Medicaid recipient), we regress the variable of interest, M edjt ,
on the vector of observable variables zjt , yielding M edjt = zjt β + εjt . We include in zjt
nursing home status, the number of nights spent in a nursing home, a fourth-order age
polynomial, total household income, marital status, self-reported health, race, visiting a
medical practitioner (doctor, hospital or dentist), out-of-pocket medical spending, education and death of an individual. Because the measure of medical spending in the HRS
is medical spending over two years, we take two-year averages of the MCBS data to be
consistent with the structure of the HRS. The regression of M edjt on zjt yields a R2
statistic of 0.67, suggesting that our predictions are accurate.
Next, for every observation in the MCBS subsample we calculate the predicted value
[
[
M
edjt = zjt βb and the residual ε̂jt = M edjt − M
edjt . We then sort the observations into
[
deciles by predicted values, {M
edjt }j,t , keeping track of the residuals, {ε̂jt }j,t , as well.
Second Step Estimation Procedure
For every observation in the HRS sample with a positive Medicaid indicator, we impute
b using the values of βb estimated from the MCBS. Then we impute εit for
[
M
edit = zit β,
each observation of this subsample by finding a random observation in the MCBS with a
[
[
value of M
edjt in the same decile as M
edit , and setting ε̂it = ε̂jt . The imputed value of
[
M edit is M
edit + ε̂it .
As David et al. (1986) point out, our imputation approach is equivalent to hotdecking when the “z” variables are discretized and include a full set of interactions. The
32

advantages of our approach over hot-decking are two-fold. First, many of the “z” variables
are continuous. Second, to improve goodness of fit we use a large number of “z” variables.
Because hot-decking uses a full set of interactions, this would result in a large number of
hot-decking cells relative to our sample size.
