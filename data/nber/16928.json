    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a locally efficient estimator for a class of semiparametric data combination problems. A leading estimand in this class is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). Data combination problems are related to, but distinct from, the class of missing data problems analyzed by Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994) (of which the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimand is a special case). Our estimator also possesses a double robustness property. Our procedure may be used to efficiently estimate, among other objects, the ATT, the two-sample instrumental variables model (TSIV), counterfactual distributions, poverty maps, and semiparametric difference-in-differences. In an empirical application we use our procedure to characterize residual Black-White wage inequality after flexibly controlling for 'pre-market' differences in measured cognitive achievement as in Neal and Johnson (1996).\n\n",
