    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze a model of political competition in which the elite forms endogenously to aggregate information and advise the uninformed median voter which candidate to choose. The median voter knows whether or not the endorsed candidate is biased toward the elites, but might still prefer the biased candidate if the elite\u2019s endorsement provides sufficient information about her competence. The elite size and the degree of information aggregation by the elite depend on the extent to which the median voter follows the elite\u2019s advice. A higher cost of redistribution minimizes the elite\u2019s information advantage, hinders information transmission, and decreases the expected competence of the elected politician.\n\n",
