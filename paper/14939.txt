Pollution, Health, and Avoidance Behavior: Evidence from the Ports of Los Angeles

NBER Working Paper No. 14939
May 2009
JEL No. I12,I18,Q53
ABSTRACT
A pervasive problem in the literature on the health costs of pollution is that optimizing individuals
may compensate for increases in pollution by reducing their exposure to protect their health. This implies
that estimates of the health effects of pollution may vastly understate the full welfare effects of pollution,
particularly for individuals most at risk who have the greatest incentive to adopt compensatory behavior.
Furthermore, using ambient monitors to approximate individual exposure to pollution may induce
considerable measurement error. We overcome these issues by estimating the short run effects of
ozone on respiratory related health conditions using daily boat arrivals and departures into the two
major ports of Los Angeles as an instrumental variable for ozone levels. While daily variation in boat
traffic is a major contributor to local ozone pollution, time-varying pollution due to port activity is
arguably a randomly determined event uncorrelated with factors related to health. Instrumental variable
estimates are significantly larger than OLS estimates, indicating the importance of accounting for avoidance
behavior and measurement error in understanding the full welfare effects from pollution.

1. Introduction
Air pollution has long been recognized as a negative externality, but considerable debates
have ensued over the optimal level of air quality, with few more contentious than the one
surrounding ground-level ozone. A proposed 8-hour ozone standard issued by the EPA in 1997
was finally upheld by the Supreme Court in 2002, but only after endless appeals and lengthy
lawsuits initiated by states and industry (Bergman, 2004). Furthermore, since ozone forms from
interactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the
presence of sunlight and heat, climate change is expected to increase ozone levels (Racherla and
Adams, 2009), making regulations surrounding ozone an area of increasing importance.
Ozone is presumed to have deleterious effect on health, especially for children, the
elderly, and those with existing respiratory illnesses, but the exact magnitude is disputed. Part of
this controversy stems from discrepancies over statistical approaches to estimate the health
effects of ozone. Estimating this relationship is complicated by the fact that individuals may sort
into neighborhoods based on the level of air quality, so that unobserved determinants of health
may confound estimates of the relationship between health and pollution. For example, those
with higher preferences for clean air or higher income may live in areas with better air quality,
and these individuals may make other unobserved investments in health capital. Many quasiexperimental studies use exogenous shocks in pollution levels to overcome sorting concerns (see,
for example, Chay and Greenstone, 2003a, 2003b; Chay, Dobkin and Greenstone, 2003;
Friedman et al. 2001; Ransom and Pope 1995; Lleras-Muney, 2009; Jayachandran, 2009), but
primarily identify long-run effects of pollution. Identifying short run effects is particularly

2

important in the case of ozone because symptoms occur shortly after initial exposure – in as
quickly as one hour1 – and can result in serious and potentially deadly asthma attacks.
Even if one could isolate random variation in pollution, however, estimation is further
complicated by the fact that individuals may adjust their exposure in response to changes in
pollution.

This concern is particularly relevant because individuals most at risk of being

negatively affected by pollution have the greatest incentive to adopt compensatory behavior.
Behavioral responses to ozone levels are unlikely to be trivial, especially in Southern California,
the area we analyze.

Since ozone is greatly affected by weather conditions, it is highly

predictable using weather forecasts. In fact, daily ozone forecasts that inform the public of
dangers from episodic ozone conditions are widely available in Los Angeles through television
and newspapers. This allows individuals to engage in protective behavior by spending less time
outdoors to offset some of the adverse consequences from ozone exposure, as empirical evidence
supports (Neidell, 2009; Mansfield et al., 2006). If optimizing individuals compensate for
changes in ambient ozone levels by reducing exposure, estimates that do not account for these
responses will understate the full welfare effects of ozone.
An additional issue concerns measurement error in assigning pollution exposure to
individuals. The most common approach for measuring exposure is to assign data from ambient
air pollution monitors to the residential location of the individual using various interpolation
techniques (see, for example, Bell et al. (2004); Dominici et al. (2000); Samoli et al. (2005)).
Given the tremendous spatial variation in pollution within finely defined areas (e.g., Tin et al.,
2001), this approach is likely to yield considerable measurement error. In fact, Lleras-Muney
(2009) finds that not only are estimates sensitive to the interpolation technique, but the resulting
1

Daily time-series studies that focus on short-term effects partly overcome residential sorting concerns, but, since
sources of emission are not sufficient to explain the daily variation in ozone levels, it is unclear whether the factors

3

measurement error appears non-classical, making the direction of the bias on estimates
ambiguous. While several epidemiological field studies address this concern by using personal
ambient monitors (Tonne et al., 2004), these studies often involve very small samples that
preclude the ability to obtain precise estimates of common outcomes of interest, such as
hospitalizations.2
In this paper, we identify the short run effects of ozone by using daily data on boat
arrivals and departures into the two major ports of Los Angeles as an instrumental variable for
ozone levels. Three features make boat traffic an ideal instrument. First, boat traffic represents a
major source of pollution for the Los Angeles region. The combined ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach, the largest in the US and third largest in the world, represent the single most
polluting facility in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (Polakovic, 2002). Because most of these
boats come from countries with much less stringent environmental regulations, they contain less
sophisticated emissions technology than their U.S. counterparts and emit unusually high levels of
nitrogen dioxides (NOx) – contributing to over 20% of all NOx emissions in the Los Angeles
area (AQMD, 2002) – which gets carried inland to form ozone.3 Our data confirm that boat
traffic significantly affects daily ozone levels and, important for our identification, the effect of
boat traffic on ozone levels declines monotonically with distance from the port.
Second, daily variation in boat traffic is arguably uncorrelated with other short run
determinants of health. The overwhelming majority of boats arriving at the ports travel from
that drive this variation have an independent effect on health.
2
Note that one can also interpret avoidance behavior as a form of measurement error: ambient air quality from
monitors will not reflect personal exposure if individuals intentionally limit their exposure as air quality worsens.
Although we can not empirically distinguish between the two sources of bias, we choose to separate them because
one has an economic interpretation while the other is purely statistical.
3
In fact, emissions from the port have lead to numerous contentious debates, and a recent senate committee hearing
on port pollution lead by Senator Barbara Boxer from California seeks an urgent, national response to port pollution.
Evidence of the passion behind the debate is succinctly summarized by the following quote from Bob Foster, mayor

4

Latin America and Asia. Due to the great length of travel and unpredictable conditions at sea,
these trips often take over a month’s time with the exact date of arrival and departure difficult to
predict. Therefore, the influx of pollution due to port activity is arguably a randomly determined
event uncorrelated with factors related to health.
Third, and crucially, boat traffic is generally unobserved by local residents. The arrivals
and departures are not included in ozone forecasts or reported by newspapers and local news
outlets.

Indeed, we find that ozone forecasts and participation in outdoor activities are

empirically orthogonal to boat traffic. Therefore, it is difficult for individuals to respond to
ozone levels as affected by boat traffic, suggesting that our instrumental variable estimate holds
compensatory behavior fixed.
While it is in theory possible that any difference between instrumental variable estimates
and OLS estimates is due to the fact the former reflect a particular local average treatment effect
(LATE) – namely the impact of an increase in pollution due to port traffic on health – this
possibility seems highly unlikely in our setting. The ozone created by emission from boats is
chemically identical to the ozone created by emissions from all other sources (cars, power plants,
etc.). Furthermore, ozone levels as affected by our instrument are quite comparable to the
overall mean level of ozone at the port.4 It is therefore plausible to think that heterogeneity in
the ozone effect is limited in our setting.5

of Long Beach: “We’re not going to have kids in Long Beach contract asthma so someone in Kansas can get a
cheaper television set.” (Wald (2007)).
4
To assess this, we computed the predicted values of ozone (at the port) if boat traffic increased or decreased by one
standard deviation (SD) from the mean (based on estimating our first stage equation). The adjusted mean for a one
SD decrease in boat traffic is 0.0369 and a one SD increase is 0.0420. The unadjusted mean of ozone at the port is
0.0396, which is bounded by the two adjusted means, so the IV variation is at similar levels of ozone to the overall
variation
5
Since our instrument is assumed to have a different effect on ozone depending on distance from the port, the above
statement is true under the plausible assumption that effect of ozone on human health is the same for residents of
Los Angeles who live close and far from the port.
5

Our findings are striking. OLS estimates of ozone on hospitalizations are statistically
significant but small in magnitude: exposure to ozone causes less than $0.5 million per year in
hospital costs in the Los Angeles region.6 In contrast, instrumental variable estimates indicate a
significantly larger effect of ozone concentrations of about $2 million per year, with several
robustness checks support our main findings.

These results indicate the importance of

accounting for avoidance behavior and measurement error in understanding the full welfare
effects from changes in pollution.
2. Background on Air Pollution and Health
Ground-level ozone is a criteria pollutant7 regulated under the Clean Air Acts that affects
respiratory morbidity by irritating lung airways, decreasing lung function, and increasing
respiratory symptoms, with effects exacerbated for susceptible individuals, such as children, the
elderly, and those with existing respiratory conditions like asthma. Symptoms can arise from
contemporaneous exposure in as quickly as one hour of exposure. Because it may take time for
exacerbation of respiratory illnesses, symptoms may arise from cumulative exposure over several
days or several days after exposure.8
The process leading to ozone formation makes it highly predictable and straightforward
to avoid. Ozone levels can be predicted using weather forecasts and ozone rapidly breaks down
indoors where there are fewer surfaces to interact with (Chang et al. 2000). Since symptoms
from ozone exposure can arise over a short period of time, altering short-run exposure by going
indoors can reduce the onset of symptoms.
6

These estimates represent a lower bound of the overall costs of ozone exposure because they do not account for
lost earnings, lost school days, the well-being of the affected individuals, and other health episodes that do not result
in hospitalizations.
7
Criteria pollutants are six common air pollutants with established health-based air quality standards. They include
ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and sulfur dioxide.
8
For example, “an asthmatic may be impacted by ozone on the first day of exposure, have further effects triggered
on the second day, and then report to the emergency room for an asthmatic attack three days after exposure”

6

Because of the potential effectiveness of avoidance behavior, two forms of public
information were designed to inform the public of expected air quality conditions: the pollutant
standards index (PSI) and air quality episodes. The PSI, which is forecasted on a daily basis, is
computed for five criteria pollutants, and the maximum PSI across pollutants is required by
federal law to be reported in major newspapers along with a brief legend summarizing the health
concerns (Environmental Protection Agency 1999).

California state law requires the

announcement of a stage I air quality episode when the PSI is at least 200, which corresponds to
0.20 parts per million (ppm) for ozone.9 These episodes, which also occur on a daily basis, are
more widely publicized than the PSI; they are announced on both television and radio.10
The agency that provides air quality forecasts and issues smog alerts for Southern
California is the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). They produce the
following day’s air quality forecast by noon the day before to provide enough time to
disseminate the information. Because SCAQMD covers all of Orange County and the most
populated parts of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties – an area with
considerable spatial variation in ozone – they provide the forecast for each of the 38 source
receptor areas (SRAs) within SCAQMD. When an alert is issued, the staff at SCAQMD contacts
a set list of recipients, including local schools and news media, who further circulate the
information to the public.
Neidell (2009) provides direct evidence that people respond to information about air
quality. He identifies the effect of smog alerts by using a regression discontinuity design that
exploits the deterministic selection rule used for issuing alerts. When smog alerts are issued,
(Environmental Protection Agency 2006).
9
Additionally, a stage II air quality episode is issued when the PSI exceeds 250 or ozone forecast exceeds 0.30 ppm,
but this only occurred once over the time period studied.

7

attendance at major outdoor facilities in Los Angeles decreases by as much as 13 percent.
3. Data
Our final data set consists of several different data sets merged together at the daily level
by zip code for the months April-October for the years 1993-2000 for all zip codes in SCAQMD.
For health data, we use respiratory related emergency department (ED) visits from the California
Hospital Discharge Data (CHDD) for the following age groups: 0-5, 6-14, 15-64, and over 64.11
There are two practical factors that make the CHDD an attractive option. First, it includes the
exact date of admission to the hospital and zip code of residence of the patient, enabling us to
readily merge it to the other data. Second, it contains the entire universe of discharges and the
primary diagnosis of the patient, providing a large sample for detecting respiratory related
admissions at such a high frequency. Table 1 shows the daily number of ED asthma admissions
per zip code for the age groups considered, as well as other independent variables used in this
analysis.
We use daily pollution data maintained by the California Air Resources Board. There are
roughly 35 continuously operated ozone monitors and roughly 20 for carbon monoxide (CO) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), two other pollutants necessary to consider because of their correlation
with ozone and potential health effects.12 We assign pollution levels to the SRA based on the

10

Although air quality episodes can potentially be issued for any criteria pollutant, they have only been issued for
ozone. Because ozone is a major component of urban smog, this has given rise to the term “smog alerts.”
11
Respiratory related ED visits include all admissions with ICD-9-CM codes from 460-519. Because nonemergency hospitalizations can be pre-arranged and may not be an immediate reaction to ozone, we only use
emergency room admissions. We find little meaningful difference in estimates, however, when using all
hospitalizations.
12
Particulate matter (PM10) was not included in this analysis because measurements are not taken on a daily basis.
However, it is highly correlated with NO2 and CO (Currie and Neidell (2005)), so that controlling for these other
pollutants should be sufficient.
8

values for the monitor in that SRA, and when no monitor is present, assign pollution values from
the monitor in the nearest SRA.13
Data on boat traffic comes from the marine exchange of southern California. The marine
exchange records daily logs of the arrival and departure dates of each individual vessel that
enters the port, along with the net tons of the vessel. We aggregate this information to the total
number of tons of boats arriving and departing on a daily basis. Using the latitude and longitude
of the centroid of each zip code, we compute the physical distance from each zip code to the
port.
Finally, data on weather is obtained from the Surface Summary of the Day (TD3200)
from the National Climatic Data Center. Using the 30 weather stations available in SCAQMD,
we assign daily maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, resultant wind speed, and
sun cover to each SRA in an analogous manner to pollution.14
4. Methodology
To fix ideas on measuring and interpreting the effect of pollution on health, assume the
following short-term health production function:
(1) h = h (ozone, avoid, W, S)

13

Given that this may induce measurement error, we also estimated models that limit the sample to only SRAs
where an ozone monitor is present, but find no considerable difference in estimates. There are considerable
disagreements over how to assign pollution from monitors to individuals. For example, assigning pollution at a finer
geographic level, such as the zip code, has potential to improve accuracy, but may also worsen it if people travel
beyond their zip code. Using SRAs is justified on the grounds that SRAs were specifically designed to represent an
area with common pollution concerns that account for geographic and population differences within SCAQMD, so
there is a high degree of uniformity in ozone levels within an SRA.
14
For maximum relative humidity and sun cover, we use data from the one weather station in SCAQMD with a
complete history of this variable (Los Angeles International Airport) to assign to all of SCAQMD. Since assigning
these weather variables may lead to measurement error, we also estimate models excluding all weather variables,
shown in Table 4, and find this has little impact on our estimates.
9

where h is a measure of health, ozone is ambient ozone levels, and avoid is avoidance behavior.
W are other environmental factors that directly affect health, such as weather, allergens, and
other pollutants. S are all other behavioral, socio-economic and genetic factors affecting health.
There are two main approaches to estimating (1) and determining the welfare effects
from changes in pollution. The first, and most common, is the dose-response approach, which
does not control for avoidance behavior but instead estimates the total derivative of health with
respect to ozone: dh/dozone = δh/δozone + δh/δavoid*δavoid/δozone.

Since engaging in

avoidance behavior may result in welfare loss, in order to measure the full welfare effects one
must not only measure the utility loss associated with dh/dozone but also measure the costs
associated with any changes in avoidance behavior (Cropper and Freeman, 1991, Deschenes and
Greenstone, 2007). The second approach directly controls for avoidance behavior to estimate the
partial derivate δh/δozone of the health production function, and measures the utility loss
associated with the change in health (Neidell, 2004, 2009).15. Since both approaches require
measuring changes in typically non-market behaviors, valuing the welfare effects from a change
in environmental quality remains a perennial challenge.
Instead of directly observing avoidance behavior to estimate δh/δozone, the strategy used
in this paper is to use an instrument that shifts ozone levels but is unrelated to both avoidance
behavior and other unobserved determinants of health. As described in the introduction, we use
boat traffic at the ports as an instrument for ozone levels to obtain estimates of δh/δozone.
Below we confirm a strong partial correlation between boat traffic and ozone levels and present
evidence to support the assumption that boat traffic is uncorrelated with avoidance behavior and
unobserved confounders. An additional advantage of using an instrument for ozone is that it will

10

account for measurement error in pollution exposure since boat traffic is likely to be uncorrelated
with unobserved components of pollution exposure.
We estimate the following equations by two stage least squares:
(2)

hazst = β 1 ozone st + β 2 Wst + β 3 M t + α a + θ z + f (t ) + u azst

(3)

ozonest = γ 1 boatst + γ 2 boatst * dist s + γ 3 Wst + γ 4 M t + θ z + f (t ) + v st

where equation (2) is the second stage regression and (3) is the first stage regression. hazst is the
number of respiratory related ED admissions for age group a in zip code z of SRA s at date t. To
remain consistent with previous ozone time-series studies that often found respiratory effects up
to four days after exposure (Environmental Protection Agency, 2006), we compute the daily
average of ozone, boats, and W over the past 5 days.16 We average across five days because we
are only interested in testing whether an effect of ozone exists, and not the particular timing of
the effect. Furthermore, this lagged structure would require us to instrument for each lag of
ozone, which greatly reduces the precision of our estimates.
The vector W includes maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation,
resultant wind speed, humidity, sun cover, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide.

Since

weather and other pollutants vary at a daily level and may also affect health, it is necessary to
properly account for them in W. Although we argue that our instrument is uncorrelated with W,
we also present evidence below that both OLS and IV estimates are insensitive to omitting
observed measures of W and to interacting it with ozone, suggesting environmental conditions
are not confounding factors for our analysis.
15

Instead of controlling directly for avoidance behavior, Neidell (2004, 2009) controls for factors that shift the
demand for avoidance behavior (ozone forecasts and smog alerts). Note that the dose response and health
production estimates are identical if avoidance behavior does not exist.

11

Mt contains day of week dummies to account for within week patterns of air quality and
health. In addition to limiting the analysis to the months of April through October, f(t) includes
year*month dummy variables and a cubic time trend to flexibly capture seasonality and long run
trends in air quality and health.17 αa are age dummy variables. θz are zip code fixed effects
designed to capture local time-invariant demographic factors that might affect health as well as
time-invariant measurement error.18

u is an error term that includes avoidance behavior,

unobserved components of W and S, and an idiosyncratic component. By focusing on high
frequency data, daily time series models have the benefit of accounting for S because it is
unlikely that behavioral factors, such as diet and existing health capital, change daily in
conjunction with ozone levels.
We instrument ozone in equation (2) using boat traffic, shown in equation (3). boatst is a
measure of tons of boat arrivals and departures at date t and dists is the distance from SRA s to
the port. We interact boatst with distance to allow the effect of the boat arrivals and departure to
vary depending on how far the SRA is from the port. In all the empirical models in the paper,.
If there is a homogeneous effect of ozone on health, a necessary assumption for unbiased
estimates of β1 is that cov(boatst, uazst) = 0 and cov(boatst*dists, uazst) = 0. Given that the boats
travel from great distances and many factors affect their exact arrival date, it is reasonable to
think of the timing of boat arrival as virtually random in the short run. Because of that, we have
little reason to expect that short run variations in boat movements directly affect health in the
short run, and below we present evidence to support that.
16

We also estimated models that allow for arbitrary auto-correlation of four lags, included daily weather rather than
averaged weather, and included 4 or 6 day averages of all variables, and this had minimal impact on our estimates
and standard errors.
17
We also estimated models with year*week dummy variables and found this had little impact on our estimates.
18
Note that by including zip code fixed effects we are controlling for the population at risk (to the extent it remains
constant over time within a zip code), so we can interpret our estimates as the impact of ozone on the rate of hospital
admissions.
12

5. Results
5.1. Validity of boat traffic as an instrument
Our instrument may be invalid if people can perfectly observe changes in pollution levels
induced by the boats and adjust their exposure accordingly. While people may have a good
sense of seasonal variation in pollution, have reliable information on current weather conditions
that may affect pollution, and have easy access to pollution forecasts, we think it is unlikely they
detect daily changes in pollution levels induced specifically by the boats. To probe this, we
assess whether pollution forecasts – the main source of information available to the public – are
based on boats movements. Shown in the first two columns of Table 2, we show estimates of the
relationship between boat traffic and both smog alerts and ozone forecasts. In column 1, we
regress whether a smog alert was issued anywhere in SCAQMD on our measure of boat traffic
and all of the covariates in equation (3), but only using covariate data for the SRA of the port. In
column 2, we repeat this regression using the ozone forecast for the SRA of the port.19 In both
analyses we only use contemporaneous levels and not a five day average since this more
precisely addresses the question of whether boat traffic is incorporated into air quality forecasts.
The results indicate a statistically insignificant coefficient on boat traffic for both measures of air
quality information, which supports the notion that boat traffic is not used in air quality forecasts
and hence is unlikely to be related to avoidance behavior.
Our instrument may also be invalid if people possess private information about boats
movement and adjust their exposure based on that information. Specifically, if the information
on boats movement induces people to decrease their exposure to ozone by limiting time spent
outside and this in turn improves health, we will underestimate the biological effect of ozone on

19

We can not use whether an alert was issued in the SRA of the port because this never occurred in the time period
studied.
13

health. We assess this by estimating whether attendance at several outdoor activities is related to
boat traffic. If private information is based on boat traffic, then outdoor activities will decrease
when boat traffic increases.

We use four measures of attendance at outdoor activities in

SCAQMD: two major outdoor attractions, the Los Angeles Zoo and the Griffith Park
Observatory, and two major league baseball teams, the Los Angeles Dodgers and California
Angels.20 Estimates for each venue, shown in columns 3-6, are statistically insignificant for
three of the four venues. Although we find a statistically significant estimate for attendance at
the Zoo, this estimate is small in magnitude: a one standard deviation increase in boat traffic is
associated with a 1.4 percent increase in attendance. Furthermore, when we estimate these
equations simultaneously via seemingly unrelated regression, based on a joint test of significance
we find a statistically insignificant association between boat traffic and attendance. These results
suggest individuals are unlikely to update their private information about pollution levels using
boat traffic.
In column 7 of Table 2, we assess whether boat traffic is related to weather conditions at
the port by regressing boat traffic on the weather variables and the other covariates in equation
(3) using data for the SRA of the port only. The results indicate that only precipitation has a
statistically significant correlation with boat traffic, but the magnitude is small. Each hundredth
of an inch of precipitation is positively associated with a 757 ton increase in daily boat traffic,
which is 1.4% of the standard deviation in daily boat traffic.

This minimal effect for

precipitation, combined with statistically insignificant estimates for the other weather variables,
supports our claim that boat traffic is uncorrelated with weather conditions. Furthermore, as we

20

1997 and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2005.
14

demonstrate below, our estimates of the health effects of ozone are insensitive to the exclusion of
the weather variables.
5.2. The relationship between boat movements and pollution
To assess the strength of our instrument, in Panel A of Table 3 we present evidence of the
relationship between boat arrivals and departures on ozone levels in Los Angeles. It is highly
statistically significant, with t-statistics that exceed 150 for both boat traffic in levels and boat
traffic interacted with distance from port. Our estimates in the second column imply that each
500,000 tons of boat arrivals and departures (the approximate daily average) at the port increase
ozone levels in the immediate area by .024 ppm, which is just over 60% of the mean ozone level
in Long Beach of 0.039. This estimate is consistent with previous reports that suggest the port
contributes to 50% of smog-forming gases (Polakovic, 2002).
The interaction term between boat movement and distance from the port allows
differential effects of port activity on resultant ozone levels depending on how far the area is
from the port. We expect a greater impact on ozone levels in zip codes immediately adjacent to
the port, with this effect diminishing as we travel away from the port. The negative interaction
term, which is also highly statistically significant, is consistent with this. Furthermore, figure 1
plots the effects of the average daily boat movement in the port on ozone levels based on the
distance from the port. The results imply that the effect of the port on inland pollution levels is
cut in half at 11 miles from the port and disappears at 23 miles from the port. When we add boat
traffic interacted with a quadratic term in distance to allow a non-linear decay from port
emissions (column 3 of Table 3), the quadratic term is statistically significant. However, Figure 1
shows that this addition does not appreciably change the spatial decay of pollution.

15

These results highlight the strength of our first stage: arrivals and departures at the port
have a significant effect on ozone levels in the immediately surrounding areas, and this effect
diminishes as one moves away from the port. Boat arrivals and departures appear uncorrelated
with other factors related to health, so our second stage estimates will be consistent estimates of
the biological effect of ozone on asthma hospitalizations.
5.3. The relationship between pollution and hospitalizations
Turning to estimates of the relationship between ozone and health, we present OLS and
IV results in Panel B of Table 3. OLS results, shown in column 1, indicate ozone has a
statistically significant relationship with respiratory related hospitalizations. A five day increase
in ozone of 0.01 ppm is associated with a modest 1.2% increase in hospitalizations. When we
turn to our IV estimates we find estimates that are nearly four times larger than OLS estimates.
The considerably larger estimates, shown in column 2, imply a 0.01 ppm increase in the 5-day
average ozone is associated with a 4.7% increase in hospitalizations.

This difference is

statistically significant according to a Hausman test, which has a p-value of 0.028. In column 3,
when we add the quadratic in distance, we find a similar 4.5% increase in hospitalizations.
These results suggest the importance of accounting for avoidance behavior and measurement
error; not accounting for these factors significantly understates the effect of ozone on health.
These estimates suggest that accounting for avoidance behavior and measurement error
increase estimates by a factor of 4. Neidell (2009) finds estimates are roughly 1.5 times larger
when controlling only for public air quality information. This difference is due to the fact that
we also correct for measurement error and other unobserved sources of information for
avoidance behavior, suggesting the importance of accounting for these additional sources of bias.

16

Since environmental factors are an important potential source of confounding, in Table 4
we assess the sensitivity of our estimates to the weather variables and co-pollutants. If estimates
are unaffected by these variables, it suggests they are unlikely to be important confounders in our
analysis. Column 1 repeats our baseline estimates. Column 2 omits both the weather variables
and co-pollutants. Column 3 omits only the latter while column 4 omits only the former. Lastly,
in column 5 we interact ozone with all of the weather variables and co-pollutants, and compute
the marginal effect of ozone on health by evaluating δh/δozone using the mean of each weather
variable and co-pollutant.21

Our estimates are clearly insensitive to these alternative

specifications, suggesting the strength of our instrument in controlling for potential confounding
from environmental factors.
Since we have aggregated all respiratory illnesses and ozone may have a differential
effect across the type of illnesses, in Table 5 we separately explore the effects of ozone on
pneumonia (ICD 480-486), bronchitis and asthma (ICD 466, 490, 491, 493, 494), and other
respiratory illnesses.

Pneumonia, bronchitis, and asthma are conditions more likely to be

exacerbated from current exposure, as opposed to respiratory conditions like emphysema, where
the effects from exposure are cumulative over time (Environmental Protection Agency, 2006).
Therefore, we expect larger effects for pneumonia and bronchitis and asthma than for other
respiratory conditions. The OLS results indicate fairly comparable effects across the conditions
with a slightly larger effect, if anything, for other respiratory conditions.

The IV results,

however, paint a different picture. Consistent with expectations, the effects are largest for
pneumonia, followed by bronchitis and asthma, and then a small effect for other respiratory
illnesses.

21

In this specification, we also instrument for each of the interacted terms by interacting boat traffic with the
weather variables and co-pollutants.

5.4. The benefits from ozone abatement
To gauge the magnitude of our estimates, we quantify the additional hospital costs caused
by ozone exposure in the Los Angeles area. We compute the additional hospital costs using the
average hospital bill for any respiratory related admission, recognizing that this understates the
full value because it ignores any direct effects on well-being not included in hospital costs and it
ignores other health episodes that do not result in hospitalizations.22
Given that the mean 8-hours ozone exposure is .05 ppm (Table 1), our OLS estimates
would indicate that ozone causes additional hospitalization costs of $462,000 per year in the Los
Angeles region. Based on the IV estimates, the cost amounts to $1,852,000 per year. The
difference, though an understatement, gives a sense of how a more simplified analysis based on
OLS would incorrectly underestimate the costs of ozone exposure.
6. Conclusion
We propose a novel approach to estimate the biological effect of ozone on health. We
isolate the short term effect of ozone holding constant compensatory behavior and accounting for
measurement error by using boat arrivals and departures at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach as an instrument for ozone levels. The ports generate significant amounts of ozone
precursors that interact with environmental conditions to form ozone, and we find boat traffic
significantly affects daily ozone levels in Los Angeles. Because boat traffic is unobserved by
most residents, it generates an important source of variation in pollution that is difficult to avoid
and can not easily be offset by residents’ compensatory behavior.
We find that OLS estimates of ozone on hospitalization are small, possibly because they
are contaminated by unobserved heterogeneity in avoidance behavior or measurement error. In

22

Estimates are comparable if we aggregate the separate impacts for the different respiratory illness explored in
Table 5.
18

contrast to OLS estimates, instrumental variable estimates indicate a considerably larger effect of
ozone concentrations on respiratory related hospitalizations. We draw three main conclusions.
First, the estimated effects of ozone on health are large.

Second, simple correlations are

significantly biased by unobserved avoidance behavior and/or measurement error. Three, our
results speak to the importance of accounting for avoidance behavior and measurement error in
understanding the full welfare effects from environmental quality.
