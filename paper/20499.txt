Should Hospitals Keep Their Patients Longer? The Role of Inpatient Care in Reducing PostDischarge Mortality

ABSTRACT
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Quality Forum have
endorsed 30-day mortality rates as important indicators of hospital quality. Concerns have been
raised, however, as to whether post-discharge mortality rates are reasonable measures of hospital
quality as they consider the frequency of an event that occurs after a patient is discharged and no
longer under the watch and care of the hospital. Using a large dataset comprised of all hospital
encounters of every Medicare patient from 2000 to 2011 and an instrumental variables
methodology to address the potential endogeneity bias in hospital length-of-stay, we find
evidence that 30-day mortality rates are appropriate measures of hospital quality. For patients
with diagnoses of Pneumonia or Acute Myocardial Infarction, an additional day in the hospital
could decrease 30-day mortality rates by up to 12.8%. Moreover, we find that, from a social
planner's perspective, the gains achieved in reducing mortality rates far exceed the cost of
keeping these patients in the hospital for an additional day.

Introduction

The National Quality Forum (NQF), a non-profit organization that conducts research on hospital quality
measures, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide various measures of hospital
quality which are accessible to the public. Both of these organizations publish their measures of hospital
quality for two main purposes: (1) to provide information to potential patients regarding the quality of
care at different hospitals and (2) to encourage hospitals to improve their quality of care. When CMS first
launched the Hospital Compare website (www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/) in 2005, only process-ofcare measures, such as the percentage of Pneumonia patients given the most appropriate initial antibiotic(s),
were reported. By 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began reporting outcome
measures such as 30-day mortality for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and pneumonia
(PNE) on the website (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2015). CMS’s perspective that 30-day
mortality rates are an important measure of quality is made clear under the Hospital Value Based Purchasing
plan, which began in Fiscal Year 2013. Under this plan, hospital reimbursements are adjusted based on
a Total Performance Score, which includes 30-day mortality rates for AMI, HF, and PNE (Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016). NQF also endorses 30-day mortality as a hospital quality measure
because “it allows for a broad view of quality of care that encompasses more than what can be captured by
individual process-of-care measures” (National Quality Forum 2009).

Although both CMS and NQF report 30-day mortality rates as a measure of hospital quality, there are
conflicting views as to whether the reported 30-day mortality measure is a fair measure of quality. Indeed,
there is an “ongoing debate about Hospital Compare, whose measures, critics say, do not necessarily reflect
quality of care provided at hospitals” (Fleming 2012). One argument is that 30-day mortality, defined as
whether a patient dies within 30 days of hospital discharge, may be more influenced by what happens after
hospital discharge. Some people have raised questions as to whether it is fair to attribute post-discharge
outcomes to hospitals whose focus is on inpatient care delivery. With this in mind, in-hospital mortality
(rather than post-discharge mortality) is often considered as a measure of quality (e.g. Clark and Huckman
(2012), KC et al. (2013), Kuntz et al. (2015)). On the other hand, hospitals play a large role in what happens
to patients once they leave the hospital in that they typically arrange for follow-up appointments as well
as communicate with follow-up care providers such as the primary care and specialist physicians. In this
respect, “[i]t’s reasonable to say that hospitals have some responsibility for what happens when the patient
leaves” (Clark 2012).
Our study contributes to this debate by exploring whether there are factors related to inpatient care
which can impact the post-discharge outcome of 30-day mortality. Studies of process-of-care measures
and their impact on mortality have led to mixed conclusions. For example, Jha et al. (2007) found that
better process-of-care measures reported on Hospital Compare are related to lower risk-adjusted inpatient
mortality, while Ryan et al. (2009) found that when controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, the processof-care performance measures are not associated with 30-day mortality. The authors conclude that “this
suggests that the relationship between hospital-level process-of-care performance and [30-day] mortality is
not causal.”
In contrast, our paper considers the impact of increasing a patient’s hospital length-of-stay (LOS), with
the idea that an extra day in the hospital may provide benefits such as allowing a patient to reach a higher
level of stability as well as providing more time for patients to be educated about expectations with respect
to their post-discharge behavior, thereby resulting in a reduction in the risk of mortality. There have been
a number of articles that have studied the relationship between LOS and mortality. Focusing on Medicare
fee-for-service patients hospitalized for HF during the time period 1993-2006, Bueno et al. (2010) documented a decrease in hospital LOS and found that mortality rates had either stayed the same or increased,
but they were unable to show a causal relationship between these trends. Chan et al. (2012) found no association between shorter ICU LOS and in-hospital mortality. Other papers found that an increase in LOS was
associated with an increase in the risk of post-discharge mortality (e.g. Williams et al. (2010), Nichols et al.
(2014), Reynolds et al. (2015)). Looking at patients with similar ailments to those we study, Kaboli et al.
(2012) examined Veterans Hospitals and found that reductions in LOS from 1997 to 2010 did not come at

3

the expense of higher mortality. Clark (2012) argued that some hospitals may be ‘cherry-picking’ healthier patients who have shorter LOS and lower mortality rates or they may even be discharging/transferring
patients with poor prognoses, so that “they look better when their death rates are compared with hospitals
that keep patients longer.” While these papers considered the relationship between LOS and mortality, none
of them conducted a rigorous study regarding the causal effect of shorter LOS increasing post-discharge
mortality.
Utilizing an instrumental variables methodology, we measure the impact of an increase in hospital LOS
on the mortality rates for all Medicare patients hospitalized for AMI, PNE, or HF. Our dataset is from the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and consists of all Medicare in-hospital patient visits
between 2000 and 2011. Estimating the impact of LOS on the probability of post-discharge mortality is
complicated; it is not possible to perfectly measure a patient’s severity level and unobservable severity factors might be positively correlated with both LOS and mortality risk. To address the possible endogeneity
in LOS, we use an instrument that is based on a patient’s admission day-of-week. In our data, we find
that the residuals from a LOS equation for patients admitted early in the week (e.g. on Monday) are negative, suggesting that they are ‘prematurely’ discharged. The average LOS for all three patient diagnoses
is approximately 5 days, which implies that patients admitted early in the week would be ready for discharge on the weekend. However, because hospitals prefer to discharge patients before the weekend (see
Varnava et al. (2002) and Wong et al. (2009)), these patients end up with a shorter than normal LOS. This
variation in LOS based on admission day-of-week helps us capture the impact of shorter LOS on increased
mortality risk. Our analysis also considers the fact that there may be unobservable patient severity factors
(e.g. only really sick patients who cannot delay their treatment will go to hospitals on the weekend) and/or
operational factors (e.g. availability of resources or specialists) which vary by admission day-of-week that
influence mortality risk. To circumvent the concerns that patient severity might differ by day-of-week, our
main analysis focuses on non-elective patients whose admission diagnosis is AMI or PNE because these
diagnoses can be considered to be “non-deferrable” (Card et al. 2009), i.e. admissions are equally likely
on the weekdays and weekend. Patients with HF, a chronic condition, do not satisfy the non-deferrability
criterion and our estimates of the impact of LOS on their mortality risk may not be valid. To mitigate concerns about variation in hospital resource availability by day-of-week, we make a design choice to exclude
weekend admits.
We present compelling evidence that keeping AMI and PNE patients in the hospital for one more day
could decrease mortality rates by up to 12.8%. Using hospital cost estimates and value of life estimates,
we calculate that, for these conditions, the impact of keeping a patient one more day in the hospital is costeffective from a social welfare perspective. Moreover, we find that our results are very robust to a range of

4

estimates of hospital costs and the value of life. One interpretation of our findings is that hospitals should
consider moving to a 7-day discharge cycle, thereby reducing the likelihood of premature discharge due to
the weekend.
In addition to 30-day mortality rates, Hospital Compare also reports 30-day readmission rates, a condition
that has also been debated as a reasonable measure of quality (Jha 2013, Press et al. 2013). The prior
literature has found mixed evidence as to whether shortened LOS increases the risk of readmission. Jaeker
and Tucker (2015) found no association between hospital LOS and readmissions. On the other hand, Kc and
Terwiesch (2012) found that for some cardiac surgery patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), a reduction
in ICU LOS resulted in an increase in ICU readmission risk, while Carey (2015) and Makowsky and Klein
(2015) found a similar relationship for AMI and HF patients hospitalized in New York State and California,
respectively. We briefly examine hospital readmissions and our results are consistent with this literature in
that we find that LOS likely does not have a significant effect in reducing readmissions.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and the sample we
use for our analyses. Section 3 describes our econometric model and explains why admission day-of-week
is a valid instrument in our study setting. In Section 4 we present our main results, including a number of
robustness checks, for AMI and PNE patients. Because HF is a chronic condition, we consider it separately
in Section 5. Section 6 briefly examines readmissions. In Section 7, we discuss the policy implications
of our findings from a social planner’s perspective and also consider the implications of our findings for
hospital administrators. We conclude in Section 8.

2.

Setting

2.1. Data
We utilize data on all inpatient hospitalizations from 2000-2011 for Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) beneficiaries. Medicare FFS is the typical version of Medicare under which 70-80% of beneficiaries are covered.
These data are drawn from the 100% sample in the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR)
inpatient file1 .
Our observations are at the patient-visit level. For each hospitalization, we have the patient’s demographic information including age, gender, race, coverage choice, and hospitalization characteristics including admission and discharge dates (which enable us to compute the patient’s LOS and account for potential
seasonal variations), the primary condition or other coexisting conditions identified by up to 10 International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, the Medicare Severity
adjusted Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) classification (indicating the DRG to which the claims that

5

comprise the stay belong for payment purposes), hospital, and admission type (e.g., elective or emergency
basis). We also generate a severity of illness measure, the Elixhauser index (Elixhauser et al. 1998), using
the ICD-9-CM codes and the MS-DRG classification.
2.2. Patient Outcomes
Given the reporting requirements of Hospital Compare, the main patient outcome of this study is 30-day
mortality, defined as death within 30 days of discharge from a hospitalization. Our goal is to understand the
impact on post-discharge mortality of keeping a patient in the hospital one more day. In addition to 30-day
mortality, we also consider 3-day and 7-day mortality since inpatient care may be more likely to impact
short-term mortality risk. Finally, for completeness, we also include 60-day mortality. Note that in all four
of the mortality models, we exclude patients who die during their hospitalization.
2.3. Selection of Patient Samples
We examine three distinct patient samples–patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Heart Failure
(HF), or Pneumonia (PNE)–because these were the first three diagnoses for which mortality rates were
reported on Hospital Compare2 . We use the primary ICD-9 codes to identify patients with these ailments.
Appendix Tables A.1 through A.3 describe our sample selection process for AMI patients, HF patients,
and PNE patients, respectively. We only consider hospital stays with admission and discharge that occur
between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2011. Because we study 60-day mortality, an event which occurs
within 60 days of discharge, we exclude admissions and discharges that occur during November and December 2011 to avoid potential censoring of our outcome variables. Due to data fidelity concerns, we exclude
visits with overlapping admissions (i.e., admissions that occur prior to discharge of the previous hospital
stay). Following CMS (Grady et al. 2013), we focus on acute care stays. Stays that involve hospital transfers
are excluded as it is difficult to control for what happens in two different hospitals and during the transfer
time.
We exclude stays that are not paid under the current DRG code based prospective payment system (PPS)
which Medicare switched to in 1983; after this significant payment change, patient care also began to change
since payments were no longer based on the amount of time patients spent in the hospital, but rather based
on the average cost to treat the particular DRG.
We then keep the patients with the specific conditions on which we are focusing: AMI, HF, or PNE.
Following CMS (Grady et al. 2013), we exclude admissions within 30 days of a prior hospitalization’s
discharge. Since the hospitals with fewer than 25 visits for each corresponding condition do not have their

Note that the mortality reporting requirements have since been expanded to include: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), stroke, and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG). However, as the initial program focuses on AMI, HF, and PNE, we
do as well.

6

performance publicly reported, we exclude hospitals that have less than 25 visits for each condition. Patients
who are discharged to destinations that provide inpatient related services are excluded. We only include
patients 65 years and older, which is the primary indication for Medicare eligibility. Next, we exclude
patients who died during their hospital stay, who left against medical advice, who do not have their race
reported, and who do not reside in the U.S.
We focus on emergency and urgent (i.e., non-elective) patients to leverage the random variation in admission day-of-week to construct an instrumental variable (see Section 3.1 for details). Such an identification
strategy is not possible for elective patients whose admissions are mostly scheduled. Finally, we exclude
patients who are LOS outliers (greater than the 99th percentile value) and cost outliers (as identified in the
MedPAR inpatient file).
2.4. Summary Statistics
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the three patient samples (AMI, HF and PNE). Table
1 shows that AMI patients have marginally higher short-term mortality rates than HF and PNE (2% and
3% versus 1% and 2% for 3-day and 7-day mortality, respectively), while the longer-term mortality rate for
AMI patients (7% and 11% for 30-day and 60-day mortality) is comparable (or better) than HF (8% and
12%) and PNE (7% and 12%). The average LOS for these patients ranges between 4.9 days for HF patients
to 5.5 days for PNE patients. Moreover, there is quite a bit of variation in length of stay depending on the
day of admission with an over 5% increase between the shortest LOS for Sunday or Monday admits and
the longest LOS for Friday admits; in Section 3, we discuss how this variation enables us to construct an
instrument to deal with the bias attributable to unobservable patient severity characteristics.
In our analysis we will first consider the acute conditions, AMI and PNE, and then consider the chronic
condition, HF, separately. Note that the sample sizes given in Table 1 may not be exactly equivalent to the
sample sizes in our regressions in Sections 4 to 6. This is because 1) a few patients stayed in the hospital
for less than 1 full day and, as will be explained below, our model uses logarithm of hospital LOS as a
dependent variable, thereby requiring a LOS of at least 1 day; and 2) some samples are dropped because
they are perfect predictors of the outcome of interest3 .

3.

Econometric Model

Our goal is to estimate the impact of hospital LOS on 3-, 7-, 30-, and 60-day mortality. The mortality
measure of interest is denoted by D (t) , where t is the number of days following hospital discharge, e.g. D (3)
corresponds to 3-day mortality. We start with the following equation:
yi∗ = βXi + θ log(LOSi) + ξMi + ψY Ri + ηHi + ǫi
3

(1)

For example, if all patients in hospital i die within 30 days of discharge, then a hospital fixed effect for hospital i would be a
perfect predictor of mortality and all patients treated in hospital i would be dropped from the mortality regression.

Elixhauser et al. (1998) defines 30 comorbid conditions using the ICD-9-CM and MS-DRG codes. Equation (1) includes 30

DRG code, and a dummy variable for having one or more surgical procedures (any minor/major diagnostic
or therapeutic procedures)5. Mi , Y Ri and Hi are all vectors: Mi is the month of hospital admission; Y Ri is
the year of hospital admission; and, Hi is the hospital in which patient i is treated. Hence, we include month
and year dummies as well as hospital fixed effects; the inclusion of the hospital fixed effects controls for
the potential impact of unobservable attributes of the more than 3000 hospitals in our study. As is standard
practice, we take the logarithm of the patient’s LOS in order to account for the heavy tails in this distribution.
We assume that the error term ǫi is a standard normal random variable to fit the Probit model.
While the Elixhauser co-morbid conditions have been widely used in previous research, these measures
are not a perfect control for patient severity. Unobservable severity factors might be positively correlated
with both LOS and the dependent variable in equation (1). Since sicker patients tend to stay longer in the
hospital and are also more likely to die, we might draw an erroneous conclusion that longer LOS leads
to higher mortality risks. In the following subsection, we describe our instrumental variable approach to
address this possible endogeneity in log(LOS).
3.1. Instrument for LOS
A valid instrumental variable (IV) is correlated with the endogenous variable (log(LOS)) and uncorrelated
with the unobservable noise (Wooldridge 2010). We now propose an IV that is based on a patient’s admission day-of-week and evaluate whether it satisfies these two properties. A number of studies have used the
timing of admission by using time-of-day or day-of-week as an IV in other healthcare settings as the timing
of admission has been shown to have an impact on the type of care patients receive (e.g. Ho et al. (2000),
Hamilton et al. (2000), Ryan et al. (2005), Goyal et al. (2013), Baiocchi et al. (2014)).
Unobserved Severity by Admission Day-of-Week: For an IV to be valid, it must be uncorrelated with
the unobservable noise; in our case, the admission day-of-week must be uncorrelated with the unobserved
severity of the patient condition. We follow the approach used by Card et al. (2009) who study patients
in California and define non-deferrable diagnoses as those for which admissions are equally likely on the
weekend and weekdays. The rationale behind this approach is that patients will only go to the hospital on
the weekend if it is truly necessary, i.e. their condition is ‘non-deferrable’. As such, it is unlikely that there
are unobservable severity measures correlated with admission day of week for patients with non-deferrable
diagnoses–each day of the week is considered the same as any other day of the week. Specifically, for
dummy variables, one for each of the 30 conditions.
5

While we do not have any data on the socio-economic status of the patients, we believe this is of minimal concern. Although we
expect patients with lower socio-economic status to be more likely to die, we also expect them to be less likely to be prematurely
discharged as hospitals are hesitant to send patients home without a solid support system to help manage their recovery. If there
were a positive correlation between premature discharge and socio-economic status, this could result in us erroneously concluding
that premature discharge increases the likelihood of mortality when the true effect may be due to socio-economic status.

9

each ICD9 code, we calculate t-statistics to see if the proportion of patients admitted on the weekend is
significantly different from 2 /7 of the total weekly admissions6 . We find that 73%, 67%, and 35% of ICD9s
for AMI, PNE, and HF, respectively, satisfy this criterion for non-deferrability. When we further restrict
our analysis to patients admitted on an emergency or urgent basis, these percentages increase to 77%, 76%,
and 47%, respectively. These results are consistent with Card et al. (2009), which finds that AMI and a
number of PNE diagnoses satisfy the criterion for non-deferrability, implying that patient severity for these
conditions does not differ by admission day-of-week. On the other hand, Card et al. (2009) did not find
that HF, which is a chronic condition, satisfies the non-deferrability criterion. HF patients may have more
discretion as to when to visit the hospital, suggesting that there may be a correlation between unobserved
severity and admission day-of-week for these patients. As a result, we conclude that AMI and PNE are nondeferrable conditions, which strengthens our confidence in the validity of the instrument for these patients.
However, because HF may be deferrable, this raises potential issues with our instrument for this group
of patients. Because the percentage of ICD9s which satisfy the non-deferrability condition is higher when
restricting to those admitted on an emergency or urgent basis, our analysis for all three conditions will be
restricted to these admission categories.
A number of studies (e.g. Kc and Terwiesch (2012)) examine the exclusion criteria by comparing their IV
to observable measures of severity. We do this as well and these t-tests corroborate our findings regarding
non-deferrability. Specifically, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean Elixhauser scores are
not different on the IV days versus the other days for both AMI and PNE patients (p = .21 and p = .75,
respectively). By this measure, there is no evidence that patients admitted on the IV days are different than
those admitted on other days. The same is not true for HF patients. Hence, our main focus is the acute
conditions, AMI and PNE. In Section 5, we consider the chronic condition, HF.
Relationship Between Admission Day-of-Week and LOS: Next, we examine whether admission dayof-week is correlated with our endogenous variable, LOS. Table 1 shows that the average LOS for AMI and
PNE patients differs based on admission day-of-week. We estimated separate regressions of the logarithm
of LOS on patient observables (age, gender, race, Elixhauser, DRG, had surgical procedure(s) or not), time
dummies (month and year of hospital admission) and hospital fixed effects. Figure 1 shows the average
residual from this regression plotted against the admission day-of-week for each patient cohort. For AMI
patients, we can see that patients admitted on Monday or Tuesday have negative residuals, suggesting that
they are ‘prematurely’ discharged. We see a similar effect for PNE patients, where patients admitted on
Sunday, Monday or Tuesday have negative residuals.

To account for potential differences across states, we run each t-test by state.

Day-of-week effect: Average of residuals and their 95% lower and upper bounds from regressions
of log(LOS) on observables plotted against admission day-of-week

The average LOS for AMI and PNE patients in our sample is 5.4 and 5.5 days, respectively. As such,
patients admitted on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday are likely to be ready for discharge on the weekend. There
is substantial evidence (e.g. Varnava et al. (2002), Wong et al. (2009)) that hospitals prefer to discharge
patients just prior to the weekend rather than keeping the patients over the weekend when many services
are not available; this is also consistent with patients’ preferences to be discharged, if possible, prior to the
weekend7. Indeed, there seems to be evidence of this preference in our data where discharge rates peak on
Friday and fall sharply on Saturday and Sunday (see Figure 2). This suggests that we may be able to leverage
the variation in LOS due to this “discharge before the weekend effect” as an identification strategy and
isolate a valid instrumental variable. Note that what we are considering a weekend effect is different than
that seen in Rinne et al. (2014), which examines the impact of a weekend discharge on hospital readmissions
and finds no effect. In contrast, we consider the effect of being discharged ‘early’ due to the hospitals’
practice to discharge before the weekend. In results not reported here, we found that this admission dayof-week effect is observed even when stratifying by different levels of patient severity, as measured by the
Elixhauser score.
Further details on the residuals of our log(LOS) regressions for AMI and PNE are shown in Figures
3 and 4, respectively, where the histograms of the residuals are plotted by admission day-of-week. An
interesting observation from Figure 4 is that the histogram for Tuesday admissions is bi-modal, indicating
that PNE patients admitted on Tuesday may be likely to be prematurely discharged prior to the weekend,
or conversely, likely to be kept longer in the hospital, i.e. over the weekend to wait for further treatment
and monitoring on Monday. The histograms in Figure 4 therefore suggest that Tuesday admission may not

In discussions with administrators at a major medical center, we were informed that on the weekend social workers are generally
not available and it is difficult to arrange for home health aides.

be a useful instrument for PNE patients. In our main analysis for PNE patients, we drop those admitted on
Tuesdays, so that the bi-modality of Tuesday admissions will not affect our estimates. As will be discussed
next, we also drop patients admitted on the weekends, and use Monday admissions as the IV. We will test the
sensitivity of the results to including patients admitted on Tuesday. We do not observe the bimodal behavior
for Tuesday admissions for AMI patients, so we use Monday/Tuesday admissions as an instrument in the
AMI model.
Resource Availability on IV days: The motivation for using day of admission as an instrument is that
patients have shorter LOS when admitted earlier in the week because of the desire to discharge patients
before the weekend. However, there might be concerns that the type of care provided to patients on weekends is different than other days of the week. This may be of particular concern for PNE patients, as Sunday
admission could be considered as part of the instrumental variable. If patients admitted on Sunday receive
different care than those admitted on other days of the week and if this is a primary driver of any differences in mortality we measure for Sunday/Monday admits, we may incorrectly attribute its effect to that
of shorter LOS. For instance, with less staffing and resources available on weekends, one may question if
patients admitted on Sundays have worse outcomes because of lack of access to care. Ryan et al. (2005)
found that while cardiac patients admitted on the weekend have longer delays to catheterization, there does
not seem to be any difference in outcomes. On the other hand, Dobkin (2003) found that weekend admission is associated with higher risk of mortality. As such, in our main analysis, we exclude weekend admits
to address any concerns regarding differences in care provided on the weekend. This means that for PNE
patients, Monday admits serve as the instrumental variable.
It is common for many surgeries, especially the more complex ones, to be scheduled on Mondays. Thus,
while we focus on emergency and urgent patients, the availability of surgical staff may be reduced for

patients admitted to a surgical service on Monday. As 71% of AMI patients have some sort of surgical procedure, this may have an impact on their care. However, surgical schedules are unlikely to have a significant
impact on care for patients admitted to a medical service. In Section 4.2, we will provide a robustness check
which excludes patients who have a surgical procedure during their hospital stay.
3.2. Estimation
We now introduce our instrumental variable estimation approach. In the first stage, we fit a linear model for
log(LOS):
log(LOSi ) = β̂Xi + ξ̂Mi + ψ̂Y Ri + η̂Hi + φ̂Zi + νi

(3)

In the second stage, Probit models for each of the binary patient outcomes, D (t) for t ∈ {3, 7, 30, 60}, are
estimated:

yi∗ = βXi + θ log(LOSi) + ξMi + ψY Ri + ηHi + ǫi

(4)

yi = 1{yi∗ >0}

(5)

Thus, the first stage uses Zi as an instrument for log(LOS) in the second stage. For AMI patients, we let Zi
be an indicator that equals to 1 if the patient is admitted on Monday or Tuesday, and 0 otherwise. Similarly,
for PNE patients, Zi is an indicator that equals to 1 if the patient is admitted on Monday. These equations
are estimated jointly via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Wooldridge 2010). In some instances, the MLE
estimation would not converge, which is a computational drawback of MLE noted in Wooldridge (2010),
so we use the less efficient Newey’s two-step estimator to estimate these equations. We estimate robust
standard errors, clustered by admission day-of-week and year.
In examining the admission day-of-week effect in Equation (3), we expect the coefficient for our Monday/Tuesday and Monday admission day instrument (Zi ), φ̂, to be negative for the AMI and PNE cohorts,
respectively. Finally, we hypothesize that these ‘premature’ discharges due to hospitals’ desire to discharge
patients before the weekend will increase the risk of mortality, so that θ is negative.

4.

Results for AMI and Pneumonia Patients

We start by examining the estimation results for the acute conditions: AMI and PNE. In Section 5, we will
consider the remaining condition, HF, which round out the three initial Hospital Compare conditions.

4.1. Mortality
Since the main focus of our work is post-discharge mortality, we present the results for mortality here.
Readmissions are considered in the subsequent section because CMS posts both mortality and readmission

16

rates on its Hospital Compare website.
Tables 2 and 3 show that when we do not instrument log(LOS), the coefficient of log(LOS) on the probability of mortality is positive and statistically significant at the .1% level for all of the models, except for
the AMI 3-day mortality model. For the AMI patients, when using Monday/Tuesday admission to instrument log(LOS), the coefficient on log(LOS) is negative and significant in all four mortality models. The F
statistic for the significance of the instrument in the first-stage regression is 3933.01 for the AMI patients,
which indicates our instrument is quite strong. The average marginal effect of a one-day increase in LOS is
a reduction in the 30-day mortality risk from .0740 to .0694, which is about a 6% decrease. The marginal
effect varies from a 3% decrease for 60-day mortality up to a 11% decrease for 3-day mortality. We will use
these estimates of the marginal effects when considering different patient care strategies in Section 7. The
marginal effects are summarized in Tables 9 and 10.
For PNE patients, in Table 3, we again find that in all specifications with the Monday admits as an instrumental variable, we have a negative and statistically significant coefficient on log(LOS). The F statistic for
the significance of the instrument in the first-stage regression is 3588.08 for the PNE patients, which again
indicates that our instrument is quite strong. Note that, as seen in Table 4, these results are robust to including patients admitted on Tuesday, whose distribution for residual LOS exhibited bi-modal behavior (Figure
4). For 60-day mortality, we have weak (p < .10) evidence that log(LOS) has an impact for AMI (or PNE).
Recall that AMI and PNE are acute conditions and we are examining the impact of an additional day in the
hospital. We expect that if there is an impact, it will be most substantial for mortality in shorter time windows. Our results partially support this. For AMI patients, the magnitude of the impact of an additional day
in the hospital on post-discharge mortality is decreasing as the time window increases. For PNE patients,
this monotonicity is violated by the 3-day mortality measure, but holds for the remaining time windows.

The results of the Wald χ2 test suggest that our instrument is able to control for a substantial portion of
the endogeneity bias in our sample. This, along with the non-deferrability results (Card et al. 2009) and the

17

results of our t-tests comparing the Elixhauser scores of AMI (PNE) patients admitted on Monday/Tuesday
(Monday) versus other days, supports the reliability of the IV estimates.
4.2. Robustness Checks
Tables 5 and 6 present a number of robustness checks for the mortality model. For the sake of space, we
only present results for 30-day mortality, which is the measure reported in Hospital Compare, in the main
body of the paper. The results for the remaining three mortality measures can be found in the Appendix.
The first issue that we address is the potential that the ICD9 and DRG codes (used to indicate the patients’
conditions and severity) are inaccurate due to potential upcoding hospitals may utilize to increase Medicare
payments, which are provided on a Fee-for-service basis. To address this, we restrict our analysis to nonprofit hospitals because they have little incentive to upcode (see the discussion in Powell et al. (2012));
the results are reported in Column 1 of Table 5 for AMI patients and Table 6 for PNE patients. In Column
2, we restrict the analysis to hospitals that are in the top quartile for number of patients as one might
anticipate that the effects of LOS on mortality could be different for these hospitals that are more likely to
treat complex cases. In Column 3, we exclude patients with a surgical procedure during their hospital stay
as an increase in complex scheduled surgeries on Mondays may reduce the availability of staff to treat the
emergency and urgent patients who are admitted to a surgical service. In Column 4, we include patients who
are admitted on the weekends. Note that for PNE patients, this means our instrument is Sunday/Monday
admits (instead of just Monday admits). Finally, in Column 5, we randomly select one hospital encounter
per patient. This is because an individual patient may have multiple admissions, which are each counted as
a separate observation, in our sample; about 30% of our observations are from patients with multiple visits
during our study period. Thus, we include a robustness check that only includes a single hospitalization per
patient. In all five columns of Tables 5 and 6, the coefficient on log(LOS) is negative and the results of the
Wald χ2 test suggest that our instrument is able to control for some of the endogeneity. For AMI patients,
the coefficient on log(LOS) is no longer statistically significant when restricting to non-profit hospitals or
when including weekend admits. For PNE patients, all robustness checks still find a statistically significant
effect of log(LOS) on mortality.

5.

Results for Heart Failure Patients

We now extend our analysis to the HF patients. Summary statistics for these patients are shown in Table 1.
In Section 3.1, we used the residual plots in Figure 1 to determine an IV based on admission day-of-week
for log(LOS) for the AMI and PNE patients. Similarly, Figure 5(a) plots residuals from a regression of
log(LOS) on patient observables and seasonality and hospital fixed effects against admission day-of-week
for the HF patients. Similar to PNE, we found that patients admitted on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday had

shorter LOS. We also generated residual histograms similar to Figures 3 and 4, which can be seen in Figure
A.1 in the Appendix. There is evidence of bi-modality for Tuesday admissions for the HF patients, so we
exclude Tuesday admits in our main model. Similar to the findings for the AMI and PNE patients, Figure
5(b) shows that discharge rates for HF patients peak on Friday and fall sharply on Saturday and Sunday.
Based on our observations, we use Monday admissions as an instrument in the HF model since we exclude
weekend and Tuesday admits.
We again use t-tests to compare the mean Elixhauser scores of HF patients admitted on Monday versus
the other days of the week. We reject the null hypothesis (p < .001) that patients admitted on Monday
have the same mean Elixhauser score as those admitted on non-IV days. In fact, we fail to reject the null
hypothesis (p = 1.00) that those admitted on Monday have higher Elixhauser score than those admitted
on other days. This makes it difficult to assess whether any increase in mortality risk is because patients
admitted on Monday are sicker or because they had a shorter LOS due to the ‘discharge before the weekend’
effect. In other words, the results regarding the Elixhauser score could invalidate our proposed IV. This
is not too surprising as HF is a chronic condition; due to its chronic nature, HF patients may have more
discretion deciding when to go to the hospital. Also recall that AMI and PNE were identified as ‘nondeferrable diagnoses’ using the approach in Card et al. (2009), while HF was not. Our instrument is, hence,

unlikely to be valid for this group of patients. Nonetheless, for completeness we examine the results for HF.
Table 7 shows our main results for all four mortality measures for HF patients. As with AMI and PNE,
we see that when we do not instrument log(LOS), the coefficient of log(LOS) is positive and statistically significant. When we use Monday admission day as an instrument, all coefficients are negative and
statistically significant. The F statistic for the significance of the instrument in the first-stage regression is
6541.77. Moreover, the results of the Wald χ2 test suggest that the instrument is able to control for some
of the endogeneity. As discussed above, we have some concerns regarding the validity of this instrument.
While the results suggest that an additional day in the hospital can reduce mortality risk for HF patients,
their reliability is uncertain due to potential issues with the instrumental variable.

6.

Readmission results

While the focus of our analysis has been on the impact of an additional hospital day on mortality risk, we
also examine 30-day readmissions. We do this for two primary reasons: 1) readmissions is the second outcome measure reported on Hospital Compare and 2) there has been substantial focus on 30-day readmission
due to the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program which is part of the Affordable Care Act.
The analysis is similar to that described in Section 3.2, where yi is now an indicator for 30-day readmissions. We use the same instrumental variables identified previously: Monday admits for PNE and HF and
Monday/Tuesday admits for AMI. Previous studies of readmissions have used different IVs. Focusing on
HF patients in California, Makowsky and Klein (2015) use hospital occupancy rates and emergency vehicle
diversions, both of which are only publicly available for the state of California. Carey (2015) uses number
of procedures for her study of AMI patients in New York State but this is an invalid instrument for our

is statistically different from zero.
Table 8 summarizes our results. We find no statistically significant results for AMI and HF. Interestingly,
we find a statistically significant positive coefficient on log(LOS) for PNE patients. However, upon closer
examination, we see that the Wald χ2 test for PNE patients suggests that for readmissions, our instrument
is not effective at addressing the endogeneity concern. As such, the positive coefficient is likely due to our
inability to adequately control for unobserved biases.

It is not too surprising that we find little evidence that an extra day in the hospital impacts 30-day readmissions. This is consistent with the findings of Jaeker and Tucker (2015). Additionally, many critics of the

21

Hospital Readmission Reduction Program point out that “the primary drivers of variability in 30-day readmission rates are the composition of a hospital’s patient population and the resources of the community in
which it is located—factors that are difficult for hospitals to change” (Joynt and Jha 2012), which is further
corroborated in Carey and Lin (2014).

Policy Implications

In this section, we utilize our results from Section 4 to estimate the impact of various policy changes that
hospitals or CMS can implement to reduce post-discharge deaths. In our analysis, we take the perspective
of the social planner who aims to reduce adverse outcomes and overall costs. Having observed that keeping
a patient in the hospital for one more day is an effective intervention to reduce 3-, 7-, 30-, and 60-day
mortality, we compare the following two policies: (1) Keep the status quo or (2) Increase LOS by one
day. This allows us to compare the effect of inpatient care on post-discharge mortality. Due to our concerns
with the results for HF, we focus only on AMI and PNE patients.
To compare the cost-effectiveness of these two policies, we first discuss the cost estimates we will use.
Taheri et al. (2000) estimate the cost of an additional day in the hospital to be $420 in 1998, which is $610
in 2014 when adjusted for inflation. Importantly, Taheri et al. (2000) show that the direct cost of the last
day represents only 2.4% of the total hospitalization cost. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (2014)
provides an alternative measure and reports that the average hospital expenses for a day of inpatient care
in the U.S. was $1,960 in 2011, or $2,094 in 2014 dollars. However, this measure includes an adjustment
for outpatient care and is therefore likely to be an overestimate of the actual costs of inpatient care. Based
on these two references, we assume that the cost of keeping a patient in the hospital one more day is $610
or $2,094, depending on whether one uses the marginal or average cost estimate. We note that the cost
of a hospital day may also change over time according to other factors besides inflation; an example is
the introduction of more costly procedures and tests. This change could be more or less relative to overall
inflation, so we will also consider the robustness of our results to various rates of increase between 1998
and 2014 for the Taheri et al. (2000) cost estimates and between 2011 and 2014 for the The Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation (2014) cost estimates.
Next, we use the estimates provided in Murphy and Topel (2006) for the benefits of reduced mortality. They calculated the value of a life-year for an average 80 year-old (the approximate mean age of the
patients in our sample) to be $150,000 per person in 1999, which translates to $214,492 per year or $17,874
per month in 2014 dollars. Recognizing this may be an overestimate for individuals with serious medical
conditions, we also consider how robust our insights are to alternative value of life estimates.

22

7.1. AMI Patients
Starting with AMI patients, Table 9 summarizes the estimated mortality rates under the aforementioned two
policies, constructed using the results for all mortality measures from Table 2. We see that the reduction in
mortality risk due to an additional day in the hospital ranges from 3% to 10.6%, with the largest impact on
3-day mortality.
For ease of exposition when considering our policy change, we focus on 30-day mortality which is the
reported Hospital Compare outcome measure. Over the 12 years in our data, there were 1,600,420 AMI
patients (see Table 1). Therefore, we estimate that on average there are 133,368 AMI patients treated each
year. With a 7.40% baseline mortality rate, this would correspond to 9,869 deaths each year. An increase of
one day in the LOS of all AMI patient results in a mortality rate of 6.94%, or a total of 9,256 deaths. That
is, the inpatient intervention saves an additional 613 lives annually for the cohort we study compared to the
baseline.

We explore whether keeping the AMI patients in the hospital an extra day is cost-effective over the
baseline of doing nothing. If hospitals kept all 133,368 AMI patients for one more day, the extra costs would
range from $81,354,480 (using Taheri’s estimate of the marginal cost of an extra day) to $279,272,592
(using Kaiser’s estimate of the average cost of a hospital day). Since we are saving 613 lives as a result
of this intervention, the total value of these saved lives is $17, 874 × 613 = $10, 956, 762 for each month
these patients live when we use Murphy and Topel (2006) to estimate the value of an additional month. This
means that the patients would need to live $81, 354, 480/$10, 956, 762 = 7.4 months (using the marginal
cost estimate) or 25.5 months (using the average cost estimate) in order for the inpatient intervention to be
cost-effective over the baseline of doing nothing. In our data, we find that AMI patients who survive for
30 days after hospital discharge live for another 5.8 years (69.5 months) on average8, suggesting that the
inpatient intervention is cost-effective.
We next consider the robustness of the cost-effectiveness of our proposed intervention. In particular, since
the average survival of AMI patients is 69.5 months, we consider the range of rates of increase in cost
8

Note that our estimates for average survival are conservative as our data are truncated with the last recorded date of death being
December 26, 2012; for any patient missing a date of death (i.e., they did not die before 12/26/2012) we assigned a death date of
December 26, 2012.

23

and the range in reductions in the value of living an additional month for which it is still cost-effective to
keep patients an additional day. That is, if the percentage increase in cost is x, then the marginal cost of an
additional day in 2014 would be $420 × (1 + x)16 . The area under the curve in Figure 6(a) demonstrates
the regime where it is cost-effective to keep patients an additional day in the hospital when costs are given
by the marginal cost from Taheri et al. (2000). The circle indicates the case where the cost of a hospital
day is adjusted by inflation only (to $610 in 2014 dollars). We can see in this case the cost-effectiveness
of keeping a patient an additional day is robust to reductions in the value of living an additional month of
up to 89% of the estimates from Murphy and Topel (2006). It is also robust up to increases in annual cost
of 17.7%. Further reductions in the benefits of living an additional month and/or larger annual increases in
cost would render the baseline as more cost-effective. Figure 6(b) shows the same for when the average cost
estimate of an additional hospital day is used. We see that the cost-effectiveness of keeping patients in the
hospital an additional day is very robust.

7.2. Pneumonia Patients
Table 10 uses the results from Table 3 and reports the estimated mortality rates for PNE patients under
the baseline and the policy of increasing all patients’ LOS by one day. We again see that keeping patients
an additional day can be extremely effective for reducing mortality. For the 3,686,544 PNE patients in
our twelve year cohort, increasing their LOS by one day saves 1,966 lives per year. Following the same
methodology described above, we calculate the extra costs of keeping the PNE patients in the hospital
for one more day to range from $187,399,320 (using the marginal cost estimate) to $643,301,928 (using

24

the average cost estimate) per year. In addition, the benefits of saving 1,966 lives is $35,140,284 for each
month the patients live. This means that the patients would need to live 5.3 months (using the marginal cost
estimate) or 18.3 months (using the average cost estimate) for the inpatient intervention to be cost-effective
over doing nothing. In our data, we find that PNE patients who survive for 30 days after hospital discharge
live for another 5.5 years (66.1 months) on average, making the inpatient intervention highly cost-effective.

As seen in Figure 7, the cost-effectiveness of the inpatient intervention is robust to reductions in the value
of living an additional month of up to 91.9% (using the marginal cost estimate of a hospital day) or 70.4%
(using the average cost estimate of a hospital day). It is also robust to high rates of increase in cost of nearly
20% (using the marginal cost) or 53% (using the average cost). In sum, keeping PNE patients in the hospital
one more day seems to be a cost-effective intervention for reducing 30-day mortality rates. These results are
robust to the possibility that Murphy and Topel (2006) vastly overestimates the value of life for our average
patient as well as the possibility that hospital costs are increasing at a rate much faster than inflation.

7.3. Managerial Implications
Our policy analysis suggests that keeping AMI and PNE patients in the hospital one more day is costeffective from a social planner’s perspective. Over the past few years, the U.S. government and CMS have
taken steps through legislation, e.g. the Affordable Care Act, to provide incentives to healthcare providers
to improve quality of care. Therefore, it is useful to consider the operational changes that hospitals would
need to introduce if CMS were to require them to keep patients in the hospital a day longer. Since we have
documented that premature discharges occur right before the start of the weekend, our analysis suggests
that one way to reduce the number of patients who are discharged too early is for hospitals to discharge
patients 7-days a week rather than preferentially discharging Monday through Friday. In order to move to
a 7-day-a-week discharge cycle, hospital managers would need to provide sufficient staff on the weekends,
notably social workers and others who facilitate the discharge process. This would enable patients to avoid
premature discharges due to hospitals’ desire to discharge before the weekend.
We note that premature discharges may arise for other reasons (e.g. congestion in inpatient beds (Kc and
Terwiesch 2012, 2009), family/patient preferences, etc.) and our results suggest that hospitals should also
take steps to avoid these types of discharges whenever possible. For instance, hospital administrators should
consider the potential benefits of increasing bed capacity if congestion in inpatient beds appears to be a
frequent initiator for early discharges. Separately, when faced with pressure to discharge a patient early,
physicians and social workers should educate patients and family members and emphasize the potential
benefits of remaining in the hospital an extra day.

8.

Conclusions

In this paper, we examine the potential reductions in post-discharge mortality due to keeping patients in the
hospital longer. Using an instrumental variables methodology and a dataset from CMS that consists of all
Medicare FFS in-hospital patient visits between 2000 and 2011, we find that: (1) Keeping all pneumonia
(PNE) patients in the hospital for one more day would save 1,966 lives per year for the cohort we study
and the value of these saved lives exceeds the cost of the extra hospital day under reasonable assumptions,
(2) Keeping all heart attack (AMI) patients in the hospital for one more day saves an additional 613 lives
per year for the cohort we study and the value of these saved lives exceeds the cost of the extra hospital
day under reasonable assumptions, and (3) While we see some evidence that an extra day may reduce
mortality for heart failure patients, the reliability of these results is somewhat uncertain. The fact that we
find compelling evidence that keeping AMI and PNE patients in the hospital for one more day significantly
decreases their mortality rates shows that there are factors within a hospital’s control, i.e. LOS, that impact
post-discharge mortality; therefore, the 30-day mortality measures reported by Hospital Compare are indeed

26

reasonable indicators of hospital quality and the government should explore how to more widely disseminate
the information available on the Hospital Compare website.
Although we use a very comprehensive database, we excluded elective patients from our analysis because
our instrument for LOS, day-of-week on which the patient was admitted, is most valid for patients admitted
on an emergency or urgent basis. Hence, one limitation of our study is that the results may not apply to
elective patients. A second limitation is that, while we provide convincing evidence that an extra day in the
hospital significantly reduces mortality risk for heart attack and pneumonia patients, we do not know exactly
why the extra day is beneficial. An extra day may provide more time for patients to be educated about
their post-discharge behavior and/or it may enable the patient to reach a higher level of stability. Future
research should explore the underlying causes of the relationship between hospital LOS and post-discharge
mortality, which can help hospitals to improve their quality of care.
