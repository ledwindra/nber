                                         ABSTRACT

We use high frequency internet search data to study in real time how US households sought out
online learning resources as schools closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By April 2020,
nationwide search intensity for both school- and parent-centered online learning resources had
roughly doubled relative to baseline. Areas of the country with higher income, better internet
access and fewer rural schools saw substantially larger increases in search intensity. The
pandemic will likely widen achievement gaps along these dimensions given schools' and parents'
differing engagement with online resources to compensate for lost school-based learning time.
Accounting for such differences and promoting more equitable access to online learning could
improve the effectiveness of education policy responses to the pandemic. The public availability
of internet search data allows our analyses to be updated when schools reopen and to be
replicated in other countries.

1   Introduction

As schools across the United States closed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, roughly 55 mil-

lion K-12 students experienced a serious disruption to their school year. Though most schools

quickly began offering some type of virtual education (Hamilton et al., 2020; Lake and Dusseault,

2020), there have been growing concerns about the effects of this unprecedented shift (Malkus,

2020; von Hippel, 2020). In particular, there are fears that low-income students will be unequally

harmed by the shift to online learning, due to less access to online resources to compensate for lost

in-person instruction (Horowitz, 2020). As states and districts consider how to best educate stu-

dents in the wake of the pandemic, it is critical to better understand the effect of pandemic-induced

school closures on students’ access to online learning resources, particularly for low-income stu-

dents.

    This paper uses high frequency, nationally representative Google search data to document in

real time how parents and students sought out online resources as schools closed in response to

the Covid-19 pandemic. Combining the online search measures with measures of demographic

characteristics by geography, we use a difference-in-difference strategy to estimate how Covid-

induced demand for online resources varied by a range of geographic and socioeconomic factors,

including income, internet access and school rurality.

    We document three findings that are new to the research literature. First, we show that pre-

Covid search intensity for online learning resources falls largely into two categories, which we

call “school-centered resources” and “parent-centered resources”. School-centered resources are

platforms typically used by schools to provide instruction, assign work, or communicate with

students (such as Google Classroom or Schoology). Parent-centered resources are more generic

search terms likely indicating parents or students are seeking supplemental learning resources

(such as home schooling or math worksheets). We show that search intensity for school-centered

resources dwarfs that for parent-centered resources and that both follow the school calendar, peak-

ing at the start of each school year and vanishing in the summer.

    Second, we show that the onset of Covid dramatically disrupted this usual school calendar

cycle of search intensity, as the pandemic triggered a very large increase in demand for online


                                                 1
learning resources. By April 2020, nationwide search intensity for online learning resources had

roughly doubled relative to baseline. We find sharp increases in searches for both school- and

parent-centered resources, suggesting that increased demand for online support came not only

from schools shifting their mode of instruction but also from parents and students seeking addi-

tional support to fill learning gaps as schools closed.

   Third, we show the pandemic substantially widened socioeconomic gaps in searches for online

learning resources. Search intensity rose twice as much in areas with above median socioeconomic

status (measured by household income, parental education, and computer and internet access) as

in areas with below mean socioeconomic status. Search intensity for school-centered resources,

for example, increased by 15 percent for each additional $10,000 in mean household income and

by roughly 50 percent for each 10 percentage point increase in the fraction of households with

broadband internet and a computer. Areas with more rural schools and Black students saw lower

increases in search intensity. Socioeconomic gaps widened both between and within the country’s

four Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).

   Our work adds to three strands of the research literature. First, our paper is the first to show

that internet search behavior can provide useful, real-time information about education-related

actions being taken by households. Prior work has shown the utility of search data in predicting

economic and social outcomes such as disease spread (Polgreen et al., 2008), consumer behavior

(Choi and Varian, 2012), voting (Stephens-Davidowitz, 2014), and fertility decisions (Kearney and

Levine, 2015). Most recently, Goldsmith-Pinkham and Sojourner (2020) use the volume of on-

line search for unemployment benefits to predict post-Covid unemployment claims. Our results

suggest that search data contain valuable information about how households react to educational

shocks, both in terms of overall use of educational resources and in heterogeneity in such usage

by socioeconomic characteristics.

   Second, we measure a new aspect of the digital divide, namely the extent to which households

seek out online learning resources either prompted by their schools or of their own accord. A large

literature documents pre-Covid gaps in access to and proficiency in the use digital technologies

by income, education, and family background (Bucy, 2000; Rice and Haythornthwaite, 2006; Jones



                                                  2
et al., 2009; Vigdor et al., 2014). Multiple post-Covid surveys show consistent socioeconomic gaps

in self-reported engagement with remote learning at a single point in time (Barnum and Bryan,

2020). We complement this evidence with the first nationally representative revealed preference

measure of such engagement, based on households’ actual behavior rather than self reports. Ours

is also the first high frequency data brought to bear on this issue, allowing study of the evolution

over time of engagement with online learning resources.1

    Third, we provide some of the clearest evidence on one channel through which the Covid-19

pandemic will likely widen socioeconomic educational gaps. Based on prior estimates of school

closure effects from natural disasters and summer months, Kuhfeld et al. (2020) predict that Covid-

induced closures will generate substantial learning losses, with the largest negative effects concen-

trated among low-achieving students. Aucejo et al. (2020) surveyed university students and find

the pandemic lowered on-time graduation rates and job offers, with larger effects among low-

income students. Using data from one online learning platform, Chetty et al. (2020) provide per-

haps the only direct measure of Covid-induced learning loss, showing that low-income students

experienced substantially larger and more persistent reductions in learning progress relative to

high-income students. We show that socioeconomic gaps in engagement with online learning re-

sources are not limited to a single platform or location but are a widespread and fundamental fea-

ture of the post-Covid landscape. Accounting for household responses to changing school inputs

will be critical for predicting educational effects of the pandemic and policy responses to it, given

evidence that parental and school investments are often substitutes, both in the US (Houtenville

and Conway, 2008) and developing countries (Das et al., 2013; Pop-Eleches and Urquiola, 2013).

    Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying learning losses that are begin-

ning to emerge following pandemic-induced school closures and can help inform future policy

responses to schooling disruptions, whether related to the pandemic or not. That search for school-

centered resources increases more in high income areas suggests either that those areas’ schools

are using online platforms more, that those areas’ parents are more likely to engage with such
    1
      The pandemic has also exacerbated socioeconomic gaps in non-online forms of parental compensation for lost
schooling time. Jæger and Blaabæk (2020) use Danish register data to show that pre-Covid income-based gaps in
library book takeout rates increased post-Covid.




                                                       3
platforms, or both. That search for parent-centered resources increases more in high income areas

suggests that, separate from schools’ actions, parents are differentially likely to seek out their own

ways of compensating for their children’s lost learning time.

   These results can help policymakers and school leaders formulate more effective responses

to the educational disruptions caused by Covid-induced school closures. Students from lower

income families and schools may require additional attention and resources given lower engage-

ment with online learning resources during spring 2020. Moreover, because remote learning will

likely remain a central piece of the public education system for the foreseeable future (Cleve-

land, 2020), preventing the widening of achievement gaps may require improving access to home

computers and broadband internet for low income and rural students. Schools may also need

to improve the deployment of remote learning platforms to more equitably engage students and

parents in the use of those platforms.

   Whether efforts to close gaps in online learning engagement succeed will only become clear as

new data become available in subsequent school years. One advantage of using publicly available

search data to measure household behavior is that our analyses can be easily updated in real time

when the school year begins in the fall. This will help reveal whether socioeconomic gaps in

engagement with online learning have narrowed since the initial shock of schools closing or if

different remote learning strategies across regions were particularly successful. In addition, the

set of search terms studied can be easily modified to accommodate new online learning resources

as they emerge. Finally, our analyses can be replicated in other countries, particularly ones large

enough to generate search data at sub-national levels such as provinces and cities. The flexibility of

this approach shows promise for understanding the behavioral responses of households to school

closures and developing policy responses in real time to address changing student needs.

2     Data and Empirical Strategy

2.1     Data

Our outcome measures of search intensity come from Google Trends, which makes publicly avail-

able weekly measures of internet search behavior both nationally and by Designated Market Area

(DMA). Each of the 210 United States DMAs comprise a mutually exclusive small group of coun-

ties and are the finest geographic level at which search data is consistently available.2 The publicly

available measure of search behavior for a given term or topic is “search intensity”, which calcu-

lates the fraction of a given area’s Google searches devoted to that term or topic. Raw search

volume and raw search intensity are not available. Instead, Google Trends normalizes measures

of search intensity to allow for comparison of relative intensity over time and across DMAs. Given

the challenge of interpreting such magnitudes, we often use the logarithm of search intensity so

that estimates can be interpreted as percent changes.

      We focus on measuring search intensity for terms related to online learning. We first assembled

a list of 45 potential such keywords, downloaded five years of weekly search data from June 2015

through May 2020, and then ranked the keywords by their nationwide popularity. We then identi-

fied the 10 most popular keywords related to branded online learning resources (such as “Google

Classroom” or “Khan Academy”) and the ten most popular keywords for general online learning

resources (such as “online learning”, “home school”, and “math worksheet”). Table 1 shows these

lists and their popularity.3 The most popular of these search terms by far is Google Classroom.

Khan Academy, one of the next most popular terms, was roughly 13 percent as popular as Google

Classroom.4 General (non-branded) learning resources saw substantially lower search intensity

than that.

      We combine the ten items in each of these two lists to create two primary measures of search

intensity for learning resources. We do so for three reasons. First, Google Trends does not publicly

    DMAs are defined by Nielsen.               For more information, see: https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/
intl-campaigns/dma-maps/.
  3
    For the full list of 45 keywords, see see Table A.1.
  4
    We normalize search intensity across keywords relative to the pre-Covid (March-May 2019) search intensity of
Google Classroom.




                                                       5
report search intensity if the total number of searches in a given area and week falls below a certain

threshold, so combining search terms substantially reduces the amount of missing data. Second,

we are more interested in the general level of demand for online learning resources rather than

the popularity of any one resource. Third, Google Trends restricts the number of keywords whose

total search intensity can be downloaded at one time, which requires us to focus on the most

popular keywords.5 Therefore, our measure of search intensity aggregates the total popularity for

the ten most popular keywords in DMA d in week t as follows

                                                    10
                                                    X  Google searches for [keyword i]       dt
                         SearchIntensitydt =                                                      .                   (1)
                                                                Total Google searchesdt
                                                    i=1


       Given the ten keywords in each list, we refer to branded learning resources as “school-centered

resources” and general learning resources as “parent-centered resources”. The former list largely

consists of educational platforms, such as Google Classroom and Schoology, that schools use to

connect with students and are typically not used without the school’s involvement. The latter list

consists of general learning resources such as “math worksheets” and “home school”, which we

interpret as parents (or guardians or students themselves) searching for online learning resources

on their own, without particular guidance from a school.6

       To characterize the pre-Covid demographics of each DMA, we use county-level data from

the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) and then generate DMA-level measures as the

population-weighted average across the counties within each DMA.7 We can therefore charac-

terize DMAs by a variety of measures, including: mean household income; median household

income; fraction of adults with a B.A.; fraction of households with broadband internet; and frac-

tion of households with a computer. These five measures are so highly correlated that we refer to

their population-weighted first principal component, which nearly equally weights each measure
   5
      Nearly all of the search intensity for online learning is concentrated in the top 10 terms in each list as shown in
Table A.1.
    6
      Khan Academy is perhaps the most ambiguous search term, in that many schools use it to deliver curriculum to
students, but parents and students can also access it without the school’s involvement. We place it in the list of school-
centered resources but often show separate results for it and for Google Classroom, the two most popular search terms
in the post-Covid period.
    7
      In seven cases (0.2 percent of counties), the county is within more than one DMA. In these cases, we include the
county in both DMAs.

and explains 86 percent of their joint variation, as DMA-level socioeconomic status (SES). This

allows us to do simple comparisons of search intensity across high and low SES areas of the coun-

try. We supplement ACS data with county-level data from the Stanford Education Data Archive

(SEDA), which provides additional information such as the fraction of schools in rural areas and

the racial composition of the school-age population. As of 2016, 27 percent of adults had a B.A.,

23 percent lived in households without broadband internet access, and 25 percent of schools were

in rural areas.8


2.2     Empirical Strategy

We first estimate changes in nationwide search intensity for learning resources as a result of Covid-

induced school closures, using both a week-by-week event study specification and a two-period

before-after specification. The event study specification is

                                       −1
                                       X                      12
                                                              X
 Log(SearchIntensitytwy ) =                  βi iBef oret +         βi iAf tert +αP riorY earst +µw +λy +εtwy , (2)
                                     i=−39                    i=1


where we regress on a vector of week indicators the logarithm of nationwide search intensity in

week t, week of year number w (1-52), and school year y (2015-2020). Here, iBef ore and iAf ter are

indicators for week t falling i weeks before or after March 1, 2020, when states began discussing

the possibility of school closures. Inclusion of week of year and school year fixed effects, which we

call calendar effects, means that coefficients βi can be interpreted as differences in search intensity

compared to the same weeks in prior years. The vector of weekly indicators cover all 52 weeks

(other than that starting March 1, 2020) in the most recent year of our data, leaving the prior

four years of data to identify week of year effects. Exclusion of the March 1, 2020 indicator, and

inclusion of a P riorY ears indicator for observations in the first four years of the data, means the

coefficients βi can be interpreted as week i’s deviation from calendar-predicted search intensity

relative to March 1, 2020.

      The nationwide before-after specification, which replaces the vector of weekly pre- and post-
  8
      See Table A.2 for these and other summary statistics.




                                                              7
Covid indicators with a single post-Covid indicator, is


                          Log(SearchIntensitytwy ) = βP ostCovidt + µw + λy + εtwy .                   (3)


Inclusion of calendar effects means β can be interpreted as the overall post-Covid increase in

search intensity compared to those same weeks in prior years. We exclude the ramp-up period

of March 2020 from the before-after analysis because school closure discussions began in early

March and nearly all schools were initially closed by states between March 16 and March 23.9 The

post-Covid coefficient thus estimates the average increase in search intensity in April and May

of 2020, when schools and parents were fully aware of the scope of educational disruption. The

difference-in-difference estimator β from Equation 3 is the average of the April-May weekly event

study coefficients β4 through β12 from Equation 2.

      To study how search intensity changed differentially by SES, we modify our nationwide spec-

ifications by interacting the pre- and post-Covid indicators with indicators for whether a DMA is

of above or below median SES. Our modified event study specification is

                                           −1
                                           X
  Log(SearchIntensitydtwy ) =                    (βi iBef oret + γi iBef oret ∗ HighSESd )
                                          i=−39
                                       12
                                       X
                                     +    (βi iAf tert + γi iAf tert ∗ HighSESd )
                                        i=1

                                   + α1 P riorY earst + α2 P riorY earst ∗ HighSESd + µw + λy + εtwy , (4)


so that the coefficients γi estimate the difference in weekly search intensity between high and low

SES DMAs.

      We modify the nationwide before-after specification to become a difference-in-difference of the
  9
      See Table A.3 for a list of school closure dates by state.




                                                                   8
form


    Log(SearchIntensitydtwy ) = β1 P ostCovidt ∗ HighSESd + β2 P ostCovidt ∗ LowSESd

                                                                               + σHighSESd + µw + λy + εtwy . (5)


Here, β1 and β2 measure the overall post-Covid change in search intensity for high and low SES

DMAs respectively. We then compute the difference between those two coefficients, which cor-

responds to the average over time of the event study coefficients γ4 through γ12 . We also run

difference-in-difference specifications where the post-Covid indicator is interacted with continu-

ous measures of DMA characteristics, such as income, broadband penetration rates, and school

rurality.

         All DMA-level regressions use standard errors clustered by DMA and are weighted by DMA

population to be nationally representative at the individual level. Nation-level regressions use

heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. All regressions exclude weeks with the major school

holidays of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s. This has no effect on any estimates of

interest but improves the scale of event-study graphs given the increased noise associated with

such weeks.



3         Results

Nationwide search intensity for learning resources followed regular annual patterns until March

2020, at which point search intensity dramatically increased relative to similar months in prior

years. As seen in Figure 1, search intensity for school-centered resources typically peaks near the

start of each school year and declines steadily until summer, when it largely vanishes. Search

intensity for parent-centered resources is steadier throughout the school year but also declines

substantially in summer. Covid-related school closures altered these patterns, with nationwide

search intensity for both types of learning resources roughly doubling by late March.10 Search

intensity then starts to decay, likely due to households successfully locating their desired online

         A logarithmic increase of 0.7 represents a roughly 100 percent increase (e0.7 − 1 ≈ 1).

resources and to school years ending in May and June. Accounting for usual calendar effects

confirms all of these changes observed in the raw data, with no pre-trends prior to March 2020

and then a large and statistically significant rise in search intensity that then fades by late May.11

       Growth in post-Covid search intensity varied substantially by geography and socioeconomic

status. Figure 2 maps DMAs by quartiles of SES (panel A) and post-Covid changes in search inten-

sity (panel B), defined as April-May search intensity differences between 2020 and prior years. Ar-

eas with high income, parental education and technological access are concentrated in the North-

east and West coast, as well as Utah and Colorado. Post-Covid search intensity also increases most

noticeably, though not exclusively, in the Northeast and West coast, suggesting that high SES areas

see larger spikes in search intensity for learning resources.

       Event study analyses show that weekly search intensity for learning resources increased sig-

nificantly more in areas with higher income and better technological access. Figure 3 shows Equa-

tion 4’s regression-based weekly difference in search intensity between DMAs above and below

median SES, controlling for calendar effects. By mid-March, high SES areas see jumps in search

intensity for both school- and parent-centered learning resources roughly 30 percent higher than

low SES areas. These weekly differences are statistically significant and do not decay with time.

Such differences are also visible in the unadjusted data.12

       Difference-in-difference analyses show that the average post-Covid increase in search intensity

for learning resources was roughly twice as high in high SES areas as in low ones. Table 2 shows,

in panel A’s before-after analysis based on Equation 3, that nationwide search intensity increased

67 percent (51 log points) for school-based resources, driven largely by a 114 percent (76 log point)

increase for Google Classroom, and 40 percent (34 log points) for parent-centered resources. Panel

B, based on Equation 5, shows that search intensity for all of these resources increased substan-

tially in low SES areas but much more so in high SES areas. Low SES areas searched 36 percent

(31 log points) more intensely for school-centered resources but high SES areas searched an addi-

tional 48 percent (39 log points) more intensely, a difference that is highly statistically significant.

Search intensity for parent-centered resources increased by 25 percent (22 log points) in low SES

areas but by an additional 27 percent (24 log points) in high SES areas. These patterns hold for

broad resource categories and for individual products like Google Classroom and Khan Academy.

Interestingly, the high SES indicator in panel B’s regressions suggests few clear differences by SES

in search intensity prior to the pandemic.

       The pandemic widened gaps in search intensity for learning resources not only by broad mea-

sures of SES but also by specific measures such as income, technological access, rurality and race.

Panel C of Table 2 shows difference-in-difference analyses where continuous DMA-level demo-

graphic measures have been interacted with a post-Covid indicator. Search intensity for school-

centered resources increases by an additional 15 percent (14 log points) with every additional

$10,000 in mean household income and by a roughly additional 50 percent (36 and 44 log points)

with every 10 percentage point increase in the fraction of households with broadband internet

and a computer. A 10 percentage point increase in the fraction of schools located in rural areas is

associated with a 17 percent (16 log point) lower change in search intensity, while a 10 percentage

point increase in the fraction of students who are Black is associated with a nine percent lower

change in search intensity. Parent-based resources show similar patterns, though with somewhat

smaller magnitudes. Measures of SES (such as income or broadband access), school rurality and

race are independently associated with search behavior even when controlling for each other.13

       Finally, we note three additional analyses that further illuminate or strengthen the prior results.

First, Table A.5 presents effects by SES quartile. This analysis shows that the observed post-Covid

widening of search intensity gaps is fairly linear in SES and not just driven by the most and least

disadvantaged areas. Second, the widening of gaps by SES is not only the result of SES gaps be-

tween regions of the country but gaps within regions. Table A.6 reports effects for each of the four

U.S. Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and shows that SES-based search intensity

gaps appear even when making within-region comparisons. Finally, because search intensity is

coded as zero for terms with low search volume in a given DMA-week, Table A.7 excludes DMAs

with low search volume. The results are unchanged, which is unsurprising given that such areas

tend to have low population.

       See Table A.4.

4   Discussion

We document a sharp increase in searches for learning resources as schools closed in response to

the Covid-19 pandemic. By April 2020, nationwide search intensity for online learning resources

had roughly doubled relative to baseline. The shock of school closures increased demand both

for the specific online platforms schools shifted instruction to (such as Google Classroom) and

for the supplemental resources that households sought out to fill gaps in their learning (such as

math worksheets). The likelihood of future school closures or partial re-openings implies these

supplemental online resources are likely to become important drivers of student learning.

    Though demand for online resources increased in both high and low SES areas, the increase

was substantially larger in high SES areas. Areas of the country with higher income, greater inter-

net access, and fewer rural schools had substantially larger increases than less advantaged areas.

Along with results from several contemporaneous studies, these results suggest that academic

gaps across students will be wider than normal in future school years.

    Our results suggest the potential value of policy responses that directly address these docu-

mented inequalities in engagement with online learning resources. Students in low SES areas and

rural communities are likely to need additional support to overcome the educational challenges

created by Covid-19. Because online learning will likely remain a key component of school sys-

tems in the near future, school leaders and policymakers may want to prioritize access to home

computers and broadband internet. Improving access to and engagement with online learning

platforms will likely be an important step to equalizing learning opportunities and preventing a

widening of achievement gaps.

    Publicly available, high frequency internet search data helps illuminate the evolution of edu-

cational choices made by households, as well as socioeconomic inequalities in those choices. Our

analyses can be updated in real time to study future changes in engagement with online learning,

can be modified to study different search terms, and can be replicated in other countries. House-

hold adaptation to schooling shocks is an understudied phenomenon that can be readily observed

in internet search data. Understanding and accounting for such behavioral responses by parents

and students will be critical to predicting the long-term effects of the pandemic.

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by DMA are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01). In
 panel A, each column regresses the logarithm of the listed topic’s search intensity on a post-March 1 indicator. Panel
 B interacts the post indicator with above and below median SES indicators. Below each pair of interaction coefficients
 in panel B is the estimated difference between the high and low SES interaction coefficients. Each coefficient in Panel
 C comes from a separate regression that interacts the post indicator with DMA-level household mean income or the
 other listed resource and demographic measures. Income is measured per $10,000, while the remaining variables are
 scaled to interpret coefficients as predicted effects of a 10 percentage point increase in the interacted characteristic.
 The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include fixed effects for week of year (1-52) and school year
 (2015-2020). The sample contains search data from June 2015 through May 2020, excluding March 2020 and weeks
 with major school holidays.

Notes: The figure above shows event study coefficients estimating the difference in the logarithm of nationwide weekly
search intensity relative to the same weeks in prior years. The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include
fixed effects for week of year (1-52), school year (2015-2020), and weeks containing major school holidays. Also shown
are 95 percent confidence intervals calculated with heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. Panel A shows search
intensity for school-centered resources and panel B for parent-centered resources. The sample contains search data
from June 2015 through May 2020, excluding weeks with major school holidays.

 Notes: The pre-Covid sample contains search data from March 2019 through May 2019 in the United States. The
 post-Covid sample contains search data from March 2020 through May 2020 in the United States. Magnitudes are in-
 terpreted as search popularity relative to the popularity of ”Google Classroom” in the pre-Covid time period. Search
 terms are not case sensitive, so ”Google Classroom” is equivalent to ”google classroom.” The focus of this paper is K-
 12 online learning resources, so we do not include keywords related to professional servives (e.g., Webex), textbooks
 (e.g., Pearson), or postsecondary (e.g., Canvas), or adult learning (e.g., Masterclass).

 Notes: Panel A presents summary statistics of data from the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS). We use
 county-level ACS data and generate DMA-level measures as the population-weighted average across the counties
 within each DMA. Panel B presents summary statistics of 2016 data from the Stanford Education Data Archive
 (SEDA). We again use county-level SEDA data and generate DMA-level measures as the population-weighted av-
 erage.

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by DMA are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01).
 Each column is a separate regression of the logarithm of the listed topic’s search intensity on a post-March 1 indicator
 interacted with the DMA-level characteristics shown (and includes their direct effects). Income is measured per
 $10,000, while the remaining variables are scaled to interpret coefficients as predicted effects of a 10 percentage point
 increase in the interacted characteristic. The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include fixed effects
 for week of year (1-52) and school year (2015-2020). The sample contains search data from June 2015 through May
 2020, excluding March 2020 and weeks with major school holidays.

 Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by DMA are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01). In
 panel A, each column regresses the logarithm of the listed topic’s search intensity on a post-March 1 indicator. Panel
 B interacts the post indicator with above and below median SES indicators. Below each pair of interaction coefficients
 in panel B is the estimated difference between the high and low SES interaction coefficients. Each coefficient in Panel
 C comes from a separate regression that interacts the post indicator with DMA-level household mean income or the
 other listed resource and demographic measures. Income is measured per $10,000, while the remaining variables are
 scaled to interpret coefficients as predicted effects of a 10 percentage point increase in the interacted characteristic.
 The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include fixed effects for week of year (1-52) and school year
 (2015-2020). The sample contains search data from June 2015 through May 2020, excluding March 2020 and weeks
 with major school holidays, as well as DMAs with low search intensity in any given week.
