    "abstract": "\n\nIn the months prior to the stock market crash of 1929, the price of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange was abnormally low.  Rising stock prices and volume should have driven up seat prices during the boom of 1929; instead there were negative cumulative abnormal returns to seats of approximately 20 percent in the months just before the crash.  At the same time, trading nearly ceased in the thin markets for seats on the regional exchanges.  Brokers appear thus to have anticipated the October 1929 crash, although investors in the market apparently did not recognize this information.\n\n",
