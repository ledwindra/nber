    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a new asset-pricing framework in which all securities\u2019 signals are used to predict each individual return. While the literature focuses on each security\u2019s own-signal predictability, assuming an equal strength across securities, our framework is flexible and includes cross-predictability\u2014leading to three main results. First, we derive the optimal strategy in closed form. It consists of eigenvectors of a \u201cprediction matrix,\u201d which we call \u201cprincipal portfolios.\u201d Second, we decompose the problem into alpha and beta, yielding optimal strategies with, respectively, zero and positive factor exposure. Third, we provide a new test of asset pricing models. Empirically, principal portfolios deliver significant out-of-sample alphas to standard factors in several data sets.\n\n",
