Why China is Likely to Achieve its Growth Objectives
Robert W. Fogel
NBER Working Paper No. 12122
March 2006
JEL No. O0
ABSTRACT
In 2002, the Chinese Communist Party announced a goal of quadrupling per capita income by the
year 2020. Starting at income levels of the year 2000, this would require a growth rate of 7.2 percent
per annum in per capita income or close to 8.0 percent in GDP. Such unresolved and emerging
problems as growing income disparities, increasing pollution, pressures on infrastructure, the
inefficiency of state owned enterprises, and political instability are often cited as reasons to doubt
the attainability of the CCP’s goal. However, China’s progress in addressing fundamental constraints
that might limit rapid economic growth augurs well for the success of its economic goals. Although
there are disagreements about economic policy among top leaders, the continued transformation into
a market economy and the promotion of increasing local autonomy in economic matters are not in
doubt. In education, China has substantially increased the percentage of its workforce receiving a
college education, and continuing growth in this investment in human capital could account for a
large portion of the desired growth rate. In addition, the value of improvements in the quality of
economic output unmeasured by GDP, such as advances in the quality of health care and education,
could raise reported growth rates by as much as 60 percent. Finally, the government’s increasing
sensitivity to public opinion and issues of inequality and corruption, combined with improving living
conditions, have resulted in a level of popular confidence in the government that makes political
instability unlikely.

Why China Is Likely to Achieve Its Growth Objectives
In 2002, the Chinese Communist Party announced a goal of quadrupling per capita
income by the year 2020. Starting at income levels of the year 2000, this would require a growth
rate of 7.2 percent per annum in per capita income or close to 8.0 percent in GDP (M. Wang
2005). Is China likely to meet that objective? That question has been a subject of debate in Asia,
Europe, and America, with an array of both pessimistic and optimistic views.
In this paper I present some reasons for joining the optimists. Indeed, I will argue that
China’s GDP is likely to grow at rates of 8 percent per annum or more for a least a generation—
that is, to 2030—and perhaps beyond that date. Before getting into substantive issues about the
economic, structural, and political problems that will have to be overcome if the growth
objectives are to be met, it is useful to look at some numbers in order to set the context for
analysis.
Exceptionally rapid rates of growth have been achieved by several poor Asian countries
for relatively long stretches of time since World War II. During the twenty years from 1950 to
1970, Japan grew at an average annual rate of 8.4 percent in per capita income, increasing its per
capita income more than sixfold, an achievement that is 50 percent higher than the goal set by
the Chinese leadership. Over the twenty years between 1960 and 1980, Singapore’s growth in
per capita income averaged 7.3 percent. The corresponding figure for South Korea between 1965
and 1985 was 7.6 percent, and Taiwan-China averaged 7.2 percent over the same period. Even
China exceeded its new growth target over the 22-year period from 1980 to 2002, when the
achieved growth rate averaged 8.2 percent per annum (Fogel 2004b). So the target set by the
leadership is well within the experience of the rapidly growing economies of Southeast Asia.

3

However, those who question whether the new goal is achievable do so not because they
are unaware of the past experience of nations within the region, but because they doubt that
China will be able to replicate the experience of past leaders between now and 2020. The doubts
arise from beliefs that unresolved or emerging economic, political, and international problems
are likely to reduce the recent growth rate substantially. One of the economic issues is the shaky
state of the banking system, which is saddled with a high proportion of nonperforming loans.
The inefficiency and unprofitability of many state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is also seen as a
threat to future growth. Another problem is the growth in income disparities between the rapidly
growing coastal provinces and the more slowly growing interior provinces, between urban and
rural labor, and between highly skilled and manual labor (cf. Heckman 2005). There are also
bottlenecks in infrastructure, including pressure on fuel supplies and electrical power, and the
growth of environmental pollution. Although concern over the capacity of China to feed itself
has diminished, concern over the adequacy of water supplies has risen. This is not an exhaustive
list of the potential economic impediments to a continued high rate of economic growth, but it
captures some of the main concerns.1
Although I recognize the importance of these issues, I shall not dwell on them at this
point. I view them as issues that need to be addressed during the course of economic growth and,
for reasons that I discuss in the second half of the paper, I believe that they will be addressed.
They are certainly on the “to do” lists of China’s political leaders and their economic advisors,
who stress the need for reducing social and economic imbalances. My initial focus is on more
fundamental constraints to sustaining rapid economic growth for another generation, constraints
that might undermine long-term growth prospects even if all the right things are done to resolve
the current litany of problems.

4

To get at these potentially more binding constraints it is useful to disaggregate the
sources of growth in per capita income between 1978 and 2002. The process is facilitated by
equations (1) and (2) in Figure 1. Equation (1) is merely an identity which states that the level of
per capita income is equal to output per worker multiplied by the labor force participation rate. In
equation (1) the output of the economy is divided into three sectors: agriculture, industry, and
services. Labor productivity in each sector is weighted by that sector’s share of the labor force.
Equation (2) is the rate of growth transformation of equation (1). It says that the rate of growth in
per capita income is a weighted average of the sum of the rate of change in the labor share and of
labor productivity of each sector plus the rate of change in the labor force participation rate. The
sectoral weights are the mid-period shares of income originating in each sector.
Table 1 shows that 69 percent of the growth in per capita income between 1978 and 2002
was due to increases in labor productivity within each of the three main sectors of the economy.2
The rise in labor productivity was most rapid in industry (6.2 percent per annum) despite the
inefficient state-owned enterprises and the inefficiencies in the allocation of capital. As Lin and
Tsai (2004, 355-356) have pointed out, the policy of gradually shifting from central control
appears to have been more effective than the “big bang” approach. By sequencing reforms that
successively enlarged the scope of the market sector, even the SOEs shifted most of their
purchases and sales to market prices rather than plan prices.
Table 1 also shows that while changes in labor productivity were highest in the industrial
sector, they were nearly as high in agriculture (5.7 percent in agriculture as compared to 6.2
percent in industry). Moreover, this high rate of growth in agricultural productivity has been
sustained for more than two decades. Table 2 shows that although China’s rate of growth in
agricultural labor productivity over a two-decade period is not unprecedented, it is at the high

5

end of experience in both Asia and Europe. Only Korea exceeded the Chinese growth in
agricultural labor productivity between 1980 and 1997, but in contrast to China, most of the
Korean agricultural labor force had already shifted into industry and services. In the Chinese
case, half of the labor force is still in agriculture, so the interindustry effect might yet prove to be
substantial. Indeed, it is likely to be somewhat larger in the next two decades than it was between
1980 and 2000.
Since about 30 percent of China’s growth rate is likely to continue to come from interindustry shifts and modest increases in the labor force participation rate (cf. Johnson 2000),
growth rates of labor productivity within sectors need only average about 5 percent per year.
Several factors suggest that such growth rates are likely. Despite the remarkable advances of
recent decades, the average technology is still well below best prevailing practice in each of the
three sectors. Hence, growth in each sector will be stimulated by the diffusion of the best
prevailing practice. Moreover, the frontier of technology is moving out rapidly, especially in the
industrial and service sectors, but also in agriculture. Third, the investment in capital, especially
human capital, is capable of rapid improvement in the next several decades. Finally, despite the
preoccupation with possible overstatement of the Chinese growth rate due to inflated estimates
of growth sent from localities, on balance it is likely that the true Chinese growth rate is
understated, especially in the service sector, due to the failure adequately to account for
improvements in the quality of output and the underreporting of small firms. I now want to
elaborate briefly on these last two factors and assess their likely impact on growth rates over the
next two or three decades.

The Role of Factor Enhancement
Table 3 presents enrollment ratios in primary, secondary, and tertiary schools for 1980,
1990, 1997, and 2000. China is compared with seven Asian nations, four Western European
nations, and the United States. At the primary level, China’s ratios exceed those of all the other
nations. At the secondary level China compares favorably with the other newly industrializing
countries (NICs), but it is behind South Korea, Japan, Western Europe, and the United States.
However, the gap diminished rapidly between 1990 and 1997. In this brief span the enrollment
ratio at the secondary level increased by over 40 percent. China lags furthest behind the rich
nations at the tertiary level. There its enrollment level is between 15 and 27 percent of
enrollment levels in Korea, Japan, Western Europe, and the United States. However, once again
it is rapidly closing the gap. Between 1990 and 2004 the Chinese tertiary enrollment ratio
sextupled (China Statistical Yearbook 2005).
It is possible to quantify the impact of enhancing the quality of labor through education
on the growth rate of per capita income by making use of the equations shown in Figure 2.
Equation (3) is a factor-augmenting production function in which γ L and γ K are indexes of labor
and capital augmentation (in this discussion I will focus only on labor augmentation). Equation
(4) merely rearranges equation (3) to put it in a more convenient form. The dependent variable is
now labor productivity and the term in square brackets brings the augmentation indexes together
with the index of total factor productivity. Equation (5) is the rate of growth transformation of
equation (4). It indicates that when all other variables are held constant, labor productivity will
grow at the rate of growth of labor augmentation multiplied by labor’s share in income.

7

Table 4 presents the information needed to implement equation (5). The top part presents
an index of the relative productivity of labor with primary, high school, and college degrees. The
index is based on the income of U.S. males by education level. It indicates that a collegeeducated worker is 3.1 times as productive, and a high school graduate is 1.8 times as productive,
as a worker with less than a ninth-grade education.3 The bottom half of the table indicates the
contribution of various scenarios of increases in enrollment ratios. Labor enhancement would
grow at the rate of 1.8 percent per annum if the secondary ratio reached one hundred in 20 years.
Multiplying this figure by the labor share indicates that such an achievement would add about
1.1 percent to the growth rate of labor productivity.
Labor enhancement would grow at 7.4 percent per annum if the tertiary ratio rose from 6
to 25 in the next twenty years, which would put the tertiary level of education in China at about
where the Western European nations were in 1980. That level of labor augmentation would add
4.4 percent to the growth rate of labor productivity, and by itself would account for over 60
percent of the target set in 2002. With a more ambitious expansion of higher education, reaching
enrollment ratios of 50 in 20 years, labor augmentation would grow at 11.2 percent. The rate of
investment in human capital would by itself add 6.7 percent to the overall growth rate.
These targets for higher education are not out of reach. It should be remembered that as
recently as 1980, the Western European nations had ratios of about 25. Only the United States
was above 50. The movement to enrollment ratios of 50 in Western Europe was a product of the
last two decades of the twentieth century. In the case of the U.K., two-thirds of the increase from
19 to 52 percent took place between 1990 and 1997.
The significance of investment in human capital as an engine of economic growth has not
eluded the State Council. In 1998 Jiang Zemin called for a massive increase in enrollments in

8

higher education. The response was swift: over the next four years enrollment in higher
education increased by 165 percent (from 3.4 million to 9.0 million) and the number of students
studying abroad also rose by 152 percent (China Statistical Yearbook 2003). It is currently
estimated that by 2010 at least 20 percent of high school graduates will be enrolled in institutions
of higher education and the long run target is 50 percent by 2050. The tertiary enrollment ratio
increased by about 50 percent between 2000 and 2004 (from 12.5 to 19.0 percent), so the
calculations shown in Table 4 may well be too conservative (China Statistical Yearbook 2005).
China currently has about 20 million students enrolled in higher education, which exceeds
current U.S. enrollments by about 60 percent. (Newcomb 2005; U.S. Statistical Abstract 2005).
It is estimated that in 2005-6 China will produce 3.3 million college graduates, India 3.1 million,
and the United States 1.3 million (Colvin 2005). However, in advancing the frontier of scientific
training, the United States still has a considerable lead.
Errors in the Measurement of Output
So far I have focused mainly on factor enhancement to support my contention that China
is likely to achieve its growth targets. I want to turn now to the problems of measurement on the
output side of equation (5). Errors in the measurement of national income from the output side
have become increasingly severe. It is now clear that official estimates of GDP for the United
States badly underestimate U.S. economic growth because they do not take into account
improvements in the quality of output, especially in such services as education and health care.
Children in secondary schools are taught more about science and technology today than postgraduate college students used to be taught a generation ago, let alone two generations ago.
Even more dramatic are the improvements in health care. A century and a half ago,
people in their late thirties and early forties were more afflicted by chronic disabilities than

9

people in their late sixties and early seventies are today. Not only has the average age at onset of
disabilities been delayed by a decade or so, but once disabilities appear, there are now numerous
effective interventions. Hernias, which used to be permanent and exceedingly painful conditions
afflicting one out of every four males, can now be repaired by a surgical procedure that in the
United States requires hospitalization for only 23 hours. Other areas where medical interventions
have been highly effective include treatment of genito-urinary conditions, control of
hypertension and reduction in the incidence of stroke, replacement of knee and hip joints, curing
of cataracts, and chemotherapies that reduce the incidence of osteoporosis and heart disease
(Fogel 2004a).
Yet most of these great advances in health care and education are overlooked in the GDP
accounts, because the values of these sectors are measured by inputs instead of by output. An
hour of a doctor's time is considered no more effective today than an hour of a doctor's time was
half a century ago, before the age of antibiotics and modern surgery. It has recently been
estimated that the value of improvements in health care, if properly measured, are at least twice
the cost of health care, but such calculations have not yet made their way into the GDP accounts
(Cutler and McClellan 2001; Murphy and Topel 2003; Nordhaus 2003). In the case of the United
States, my own rough estimates indicate that allowing for such factors as the increase in leisure
time, the improvement in the quality of health care, and the improvements in the quality of
education would come close to doubling the U.S. annual growth rate of per capita income over
the past century (from 2.0 to 3.6 percent per annum).
What is the implication of these statistics for understanding the change in standards of
living for the typical American? If we use the conventional measure of growth, the real income
of the typical American in 2000 was 7 times greater than it was in 1900. However, if an adjusted

10

measure is used, Americans in 2000 had real incomes that were 34 times greater than in 1900. In
other words, 80 percent of the goods and services that Americans enjoy today are outside of the
measured economy (Fogel 2000 and 2004a).
What is the implication of the failure to take account of improvements in the quality of
output for the measurement of Chinese economic growth? In China the main increases in life
expectancy took place before the onset of the period of reform. Between 1950 and 1980, life
expectancy at birth increased from 40.8 to 67.8 years. By 2000 life expectancy stood at about
71.4, an increase of about 0.18 years of life expectancy per calendar year during the period of
accelerated economic reform (Keyfitz and Flieger 1990; China Statistical Yearbook 2003).
Studies of the value of a statistical life year in rich and poor nations suggest that the value of an
additional year of life in China is about 3.5 times per capita income (see, e.g., Murphy and Topel
2002; Viscusi and Aldy 2003). Hence, the value of the unmeasured improvements in life
expectancy may have been high enough to raise the rate of economic growth between 1980 and
2000 by about 60 percent. If the true growth of GDP between 2000 and 2040 is 13 percent
instead of 8 percent, then the true size of the Chinese economy in 2040 will be about 6 times the
size of the measured economy. Of course, if both the United States and China similarly neglect
changes of quality in their measurements, the relative ranking of the two economies may not be
changed significantly.
Will Political Instability Undermine Economic Growth?
So far I have focused purely on economic issues. Some analysts argue that political
instability is a serious impediment to China’s ability to maintain high rates of economic growth.
Several scenarios have been outlined in which political factors could thwart economic goals.
Some of these scenarios begin with an economic breakdown brought on by a sharp cyclical

11

downturn that would raise unemployment and undermine a precarious social stability. Others
warn that a growing social unrest has been brought on by the financial problems and
inefficiencies of the state-owned enterprises. These problems have not only led to rising urban
unemployment but have also resulted in the failure to pay promised wages, pensions, health-care
allowances, and housing allowances (Bremmer 2005; Chaohua 2005). Still others warn of an
impending breakdown in the banking system, which is beset by a huge burden of nonperforming
loans, a breakdown that could undermine the microeconomic stability of the economy (Garnaut
and Song 2004).
Other threats to stability that have been observed include: widespread corruption; internal
power struggles; bubbles in real estate, international trade, and steel (among other products);
inequality between the urban and rural areas, between the coastal and interior provinces, between
the highly educated elites and poorly educated masses, and between the Han majority and the
ethnic minorities. One unique warning singles out the sharp rise in the sex ratio concentrated at
ages 15–34, which, it is argued, will translate into high rates of crime and violence and may
promote concubinage. Some single out international tensions, particularly over Taiwan, which
divert the attention of the leadership from their growth objectives (Pei 2005; Bradsher 2004;
Dunphy 2004, Hu 2000; Lim 2004; Business Asia 2002; McGregor 2004; Wilson 2004; EIU
ViewsWire 2004).
When speculating about the future, the range of possible scenarios is virtually unlimited.
The point at issue is not what might occur, but what is likely to occur. Moreover, many of the
problems singled out are of long standing, such as the inefficiency of many state-owned
enterprises. While these SOEs may be a drag on the economy, China has nevertheless been able
to grow at over 8 percent per capita for a quarter of a century. The idea that these inefficient

12

firms will suddenly go bankrupt is far-fetched. The policy of the State Council has been to
gradually phase them out or to reorganize them on a profitable basis so as not to sharply increase
unemployment. Not only does the government have the finances needed to continue subsidizing
inefficient firms if it chooses to do so for economic or political reasons, but the burden of these
subsidies will also gradually diminish, because the share of the industrial output supplied by
these underperforming SOEs will gradually decline and the burden of a given level of subsidies
will rapidly diminish with the economy growing so rapidly.
These points also apply to the problem of the state banks. Although the proportion of
nonperforming loans may be about 35 percent, China is not in immediate danger of a collapse of
its banking system. It is within the power of the government to remove this burden. The banks
originally became saddled with the bad paper because the government obliged the banks to
finance unprofitable SOEs. The inefficiencies and distortions in the economy produced by
banking policies have been relieved by the large injection of foreign direct investment,
encouraged by government policy, which has also facilitated the transfer of advanced
technologies to China. With direct investment going largely into large-scale industry, the banks
have been able to supply part of the capital needed by small-scale enterprises (Lin, Cai, and Li
2003; Fan 2005). Movements in the direction of more effectively using the monetary system to
manage business cycles, and contemplated reforms in capital markets, should also alleviate
economic distortions. For example, the government recently restructured two of the four largest
state-owned banks to bring their capital position up to international standards. Most important,
perhaps, is the very low level of government indebtedness (less than a fifth of GDP), which gives
the State Council leeway to pursue needed stabilization policies, including a rapid restructuring

13

of the banking system, instead of the gradual policy of reform it is currently pursuing (Lin, Cai,
and Li 2003; Fan 2005).
Although there are disagreements about economic policy among the top leaders, the
proposition that China should continue to transform itself into a market economy is not at issue.
Nor is there disagreement over the policy of promoting increasing autonomy in economic
decisions as a lever of rapid economic growth. As many analysts have pointed out, the
government is unified around a policy that has been called “market preserving federalism.” This
Chinese form of federalism limits the central government’s control over economic decision
making, promotes creative competition among local governments, constrains rent seeking, and
provides an array of incentives to induce creative local enterprises. This type of federalism is
also apparent in the design of the tax system, which has been called “fiscal federalism,” and
which is aimed at preventing taxation from stifling economic growth. In the tax reform of 1994,
the central government limited its primary administration to VAT and taxes on centrally owned
enterprises. It also set up local tax bureaus under the direction of local governments to supervise
income taxes. While much remains to be done in the design of the fiscal system, especially with
respect to narrowing regional inequalities, these issues are on the leadership’s agenda of needed
reforms. The central leadership is also aware of the danger that local autonomy may move in
counterproductive ways that promote rent seeking, moral hazard, and other forms of corruption,
and that it must monitor performance and penalize corruption where possible. The successful
unfolding of autonomy requires a center strong enough to integrate national and local goals, to
discipline local authorities whose corrupt practices threaten the progress of reform, and to
provide rewards to those who advance it (Lin, Cai, and Li 2003; Bahl and Martinez-Vazquez

14

2003; Blanchard and Shleifer 2000; Montinola, Qian, and Weingast 1996; Krug, Zhu, and
Hendrischke 2003).
Some analysts argue that unless China permits competing political parties, powerful
pressures will build up between the provinces and the center that will undermine political
stability and thwart continued high rates of economic growth. Others argue that the unsolved
inequalities have also built up pressures at the grass roots that threaten to become unmanageable
(Goldstone 1995; Ohman 1995; Esarey 2002). Other issues stressed by analysts include
mounting environmental hazards, lagging development of public health programs, and endemic
corruption (Shambaugh 2000; Chapman 2002).
The difficulty with these arguments is that they assume that the leaders of the CCP and
the State Council are unaware of these problems. The leaders are quite well aware that the
successes of their growth policies have weakened the central government’s control over daily life
and access to information. Indeed, one purpose of the reforms was to promote creativity at the
local level by promoting local initiative and by encouraging the entry of global firms into the
Chinese market in order to facilitate new ideas and technologies. Moreover, critiques of current
policies that hamper economic growth are encouraged, although competitive political parties are
prohibited. Debates over governmental policies at all levels are as vigorous and wide-ranging at
the meetings of the Chinese Economists Society as they are at the American Economic
Association.
The leaders of the CCP have responded to the changing economic and social conditions
by changing the central goal of the CCP and by co-opting the elites who are at the forefront of
China’s economic and social transformation. This process of adaptation is reflected in the new
slogan of the CCP, “Three Represents,” introduced by Jiang Zemin in the spring of 2000 to

15

replace the previous slogan of “Three Revolutionary Classes” (peasants, workers, and soldiers).
The new slogan portrays the CCP as: (1) the embodiment of society’s most advanced productive
forces; (2) the promoter of an advanced culture; and (3) representing the needs and interests of
the great majority of the Chinese population. To extend its connections with the elites who are
bringing about the transformation of China, the CCP encouraged the formation of a wide array of
new business and professional societies with strong ties to the state. It also transformed the
membership of the CCP, bringing into its fold the technocratic leaders of business, social, and
intellectual life. During the two decades following 1982, the proportion of the Central
Committee members holding college degrees increased from a little over half to nearly 99
percent (Dickson 2003a and b).
The 16th Congress of the CCP, which met in November 2002, made provincial leaders the
most prominent group in the Politburo, representing 42 percent of its membership. By contrast,
the military represented only 8 percent of the Politburo, and central party institutions accounted
for 25 percent. The balance of the Politburo membership came from Shanghai political circles or
from institutions other than provincial leaderships or central government institutions. Given the
dominant role of provincial leaders in the shaping of national policy, it makes little sense to
dwell on the possibility of a conflict between the national and provincial leaders, especially when
many of the central leaders came from provincial posts (Bo 2004).
Some analysts argue that leaders of the CCP and the State Council are out of touch with
public opinion. However, the weight of evidence contradicts that view. Local and provincial
governments have been using polling techniques to determine public opinion on an array of
economic and social issues since the late 1980s. Academic critics of government policies abound
and interactions between these critics and top government leaders are numerous. The range of

16

problems raised by respondents to surveys mirrors the complaints of academic critics and foreign
analysts, including widespread corruption, increasing inequality, persistent unemployment,
burdensome taxes, and unpaid pensions. Nevertheless, the polls also reveal majority support for
the central government and overwhelming belief that the courts, the press, and government
institutions will be responsive to their grievances (Pei 2001; Lin et al. 2002; China Newsweek
2005).4
Popular confidence in the government reflects the widespread belief among the Chinese
that their living conditions have improved (67 percent better, 12 percent worse, 20 percent no
change). The level of confidence about whether living conditions will continue to improve is
similar. According to another poll, optimism about the future is slightly higher in rural areas (75
percent) than in the cities (68 percent). Hence, it is not surprising that political reform is quite
limited, although there is an expectation that the government will gradually improve legal and
governmental institutions. This generally favorable view of government not only reflects the
pragmatic responses of leaders at all levels of government to grievances, but also the frequent
intervention of the central government with local officials when they are too slow to respond to
complaints. It also reflects the rapid increases in income experienced by the great majority of
households for more than a quarter of a century (Fewsmith 2003).5
This combination of widely shared economic advances and governmental attention to
public opinion, especially with respect to grievances, is a formula for continued political
stability. One indication of the stability of the regime and the self-confidence of its leaders is its
successful bid for the 2008 Olympic Games. Another is its encouragement of Chinese students to
enroll in American and European universities. The gradual loosening of constraints on
expression in China is likely to continue over the next several decades. Whether or not these

17

developments lead to a multiparty system of the American type remains to be seen. However,
the government’s responsiveness to popular concerns indicates that political stability is likely to
remain at the level required for continued long-term economic growth.

Notes
1. Discussions of economic impediments that may foil the growth targets of China are
summarized in Shane 2005; Zakaria 2005; Morrison 2005; R. Wang 2005; Economist
2004a, 2004b, 2005a; Prasad 2004.
2. The disaggregation shown in Table 1 is based on data from the China Statistical
Yearbook 2003, pp. 26, 27, 313. In the absence of a GDP deflator, the retail fixed-base
price index was used to obtain real GDP. Because the differential approximation shown
*

in equation (1) does not quite add up to Y , the sum of the terms on the right-hand side of
the equation was used as the denominator when computing the contribution of changes in
the LFPR, in inter-industry shifts in the labor force, and in within-sector productivity to
the overall change in per capita income.
3. The relative index for other G-8 countries reporting data were somewhat different from
those shown for the United States in Table 2, but not materially so. Their use would not
materially change the analysis. I prefer the U.S. figures as reported in Table 2 because it
is likely that even they underestimate the impact of labor-augmentation on Chinese
economic growth. The data reported by OECD for 6 of the G-8 countries for 1997, 1998,
or 1999 are as follows:

The values of the U.S. index in this table differ from those in Table 2 for several reasons.
The values here are based on average income over both sexes rather than the median
income for men only. The age range here excludes persons aged 65 and over. The years
used here are 1997, 1998, or 1999 rather than 2000. But the most important factor is that
the base here is less than twelfth grade rather than less than ninth grade. It should be
noted that in Table 2, the ratio of the income of persons with college degrees to those
with high school degrees is 173. In this note it is 181.
4. Other interesting discussions of political stresses and responses include Huang 1995;
Chapman 2002; Gong 2005; D. Wang 2005; and Bremmer 2005.
5. It is also worth noting the distinction made by Fareed Zakaria between liberal
democracies, illiberal democracies, and liberalizing autocracies. Liberal democracies are
not only marked by contested elections, but also by governments that seek to protect the
autonomy and dignity of individuals against coercion, create checks on the power of
various branches of government, and establish equality under law. Illiberal democracies
have contested elections but the elected governments use their power to repress speech
and assembly and to restrict economic and social behavior. Liberalizing autocracies have

19

one-party systems but have permitted individuals limited political rights and have
improved the spheres of economic, social, and civil rights. He argues that most East
Asian governments today “are a mix of democracy, liberalism, capitalism, oligarchy, and
corruption—much like Western governments circa 1900” (Zakaria 1997, 28; cf. Zakaria
2003. See also Economist 2005b).

Note: Gross enrollment ratios are equal to the total enrollment of all ages in the school level
divided by the population of the specific ages that correspond to the specific age groups that
correspond to the school level. Ratios may exceed 100 because of the students outside the
