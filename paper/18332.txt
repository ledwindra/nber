Equalizing Outcomes and Equalizing Opportunities: Optimal Taxation when Children's Abilities
Depend on Parents' Resources

August 2012, Revised April 2014

ABSTRACT
Empirical research suggests that parents' economic resources affect their children's future earnings
abilities. Optimal tax policy therefore treats future ability distributions as endogenous to current taxes.
We model this endogeneity, calibrate the model to match estimates of the intergenerational transmission
of earnings ability in the United States, and use the model to simulate such an optimal policy numerically.
The optimal policy in this context is more redistributive toward low-income parents than existing U.S.
tax policy. It also increases the probability that low-income children move up the economic ladder,
generating a present-value welfare gain of one and three-quarters percent of consumption in our baseline
case.

Introduction
Economists have long recognized that parents’resources and investment in their children may be key
determinants of their children’s outcomes (Arleen Leibowitz 1974; Gary Becker and Nigel Tomes
1976; Becker 1981; Becker and Tomes 1986).

This paper is motivated by recent evidence that

increasing the disposable incomes of poor parents raises the performance of their children on tests
of cognitive ability. That …nding suggests that current tax policy may a¤ect the future distribution
of underlying income-earning abilities in the taxpayer population, the key determinant of how
di¢ cult a tradeo¤ between e¢ ciency and equality society will face in the future. The dominant
modern model of optimal taxation is unable to take this e¤ect into account, as it assumes that the
distribution of ability is entirely exogenous. Our paper is an analytical and numerical exploration
of the implications for optimal policy of relaxing this assumption.
First, we generalize a standard dynamic Mirrleesian optimal tax model to include the e¤ect of
parental disposable income on children’s abilities. In the standard model of James Mirrlees (1971),
ability is exogenously given. In our model, a child’s ability depends on three components: parental
ability, which is exogenous to the parent and child; parental disposable income, which is endogenously chosen by parents given the tax system; and a stochastic shock. These components imply
that the process generating children’s skills in our model is partly exogenous, partly endogenous,
and stochastic. By combining these components, our model introduces a novel element to the recent literature on dynamic optimal taxation that seeks, among other goals, to capture the complex
process by which society’s ability distribution is determined.1
Using this model, we derive analytical conditions that reveal the key e¤ects of endogenous
ability on optimal intratemporal and intertemporal policy. On the intratemporal margin, we …nd
contradictory forces at play. First, marginal income tax rates are lower on parents whose economic
resources matter more for their children’s expected abilities. Lower marginal tax rates encourage
greater parental earnings and disposable income, and because of endogenous ability, these parents
thus produce higher-skilled children from whom society will be able to collect more tax revenue.
Evidence suggests the impact of parental resources on child skills is largest among parents with low
incomes, so this force is likely to lead to lower marginal tax rates on low incomes relative to high
incomes. Second, if low-ability parents enjoy a high relative return to earning disposable income
(due to its larger e¤ects on their children), incentive problems are relaxed relative to a setting with

lifecycle path of earnings (see Matthew Weinzierl 2011 or Emmanuel Farhi and Ivan Werning 2013, for example).

exogenous ability, so marginal distortions on low earners can be reduced (thus reinforcing the …rst
factor). Third, and working in the opposite direction, lower marginal tax rates on low incomes will
in expectation di¤erentially bene…t low earners in prior generations because low-income parents
are more likely than high-income parents to have low-ability children. This di¤erential bene…t
increases the temptation for high-ability ancestors to feign low ability by earning less and accepting
the greater probability of having low-ability descendants. In doing so, it worsens the distortionary
e¤ects of marginal taxes on e¤ort. This factor works against the others, acting as a force for higher
marginal tax rates at low incomes. The relative strength of these forces determines how optimal
marginal tax rates di¤er from a conventional policy.
On the intertemporal margin, we derive a condition showing that the allocation of resources
should equalize the cost of raising welfare across generations, taking into account not only the
marginal utilities of individuals in each generation (as in a conventional model), but also the e¤ects
of the current distribution of resources on prior generations’incentives and future generations’tax
payments and utility levels. As a result, welfare-maximizing policy takes advantage of its potential
to shape the ability distribution of future generations. For example, suppose hypothetically that
the ability distribution is stable across generations under an existing tax policy. A conventional
optimal policy model would recommend that generations be treated similarly, as each generation
resembles the next. Our model may recommend a di¤erent approach. Namely, the optimal policy
in this case borrows from future generations to fund greater after-tax income for parents in the
current generation.
Together, optimizing policy along these intra- and inter-generational margins can generate an
upward trajectory for the ability distribution across generations, generating more productive future
populations and greater welfare overall.
Second, we calibrate our model to empirical evidence and solve numerically for the optimal
policy. The model calibration requires empirical estimates of key statistics describing the transmission of ability across generations under an existing tax policy. To generate these estimates, we
study the e¤ect of policy changes in the U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on the ability
levels of taxpayers’ children. Our empirical approach adapts the strategy of Gordon Dahl and
Lance Lochner (forthcoming) in order to generate estimates relevant to the calibration exercise we
perform.2 Speci…cally, dividing matched parents and children in the National Longitudinal Survey
2
Viewed in isolation, we see the empirical work as merely a secondary contribution of the paper, as our work is
closely related to the Dahl and Lochner analysis. The estimates it generates are primarily useful as inputs to the
calibration and simulation of the model.

of Youth (NLSY) and Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CNLSY) into four
equally-sized ability categories each, we estimate the e¤ect of parents’ after-tax income on the
probability that parents in each wage category have children in each category, and we calculate the
transition matrices between ability categories across generations. Then, using a smooth approximation of Laurence Kotliko¤ and David Rapson’s (2007) estimates of e¤ective marginal tax rates
in the United States as the status quo tax policy, we …nd the values of the model’s parameters that
yield a model output that best matches the target statistics, when optimizing households take that
policy as given.
We use the calibrated model to simulate Utilitarian-optimal policy, and we …nd that the pattern
of optimal average and marginal tax rates is very di¤erent than the status quo. The optimal policy
redistributes substantially more toward low-ability parents and earlier generations than does the
status quo policy. The increase in redistribution toward low earners is driven by the Utilitarian
objective assumed in the conventional optimal policy model. Nevertheless, the increase in redistribution generates an upward shift in the mean ability level across generations relative to the status
quo, with a smaller share of the population having lower abilities and a larger share having higher
abilities. We calculate the increase in aggregate welfare due to only the improved evolution of the
ability distribution. We …nd that the gain is equivalent to a 1.75 percent permanent increase in disposable income in our baseline case–i.e. an increase of one and three-quarters percent in disposable
income for all generations.
This paper introduces a new element to the active literature in dynamic optimal taxation.
Following the original contribution of Mikhail Golosov, Narayana Kocherlakota, and Aleh Tsyvinski
(2003), most work in this area has considered the impact of stochastic and exogenous skill processes
on the optimal taxation of an individual over his lifetime.3 Emmanuel Farhi and Iván Werning
(2010) extend that approach to characterize optimal taxation across generations, noting in their
opening sentences that "One of the biggest risks in life is the family one is born into. We partly
inherit the luck, good or bad, of our parents through the wealth they accumulate." Their important
analysis assumed, however, that children’s skills are independent of their parents’ abilities and
their parents’economic resources, leaving unaddressed a core part of the "family risk" that is their
focus.4 We take up the complementary analysis. That is, we analyze optimal tax policy when

Farhi and Werning do consider a simple form of parental investment in children’s human capital in the two-period
version of their analysis, but children do not exert e¤ort in that version.

the skill distribution of one generation depends on the skill distribution and the choices of the
previous generation (subject to stochastic shocks). Because we allow the skill distribution to be
endogenously determined, our paper is closely related to another body of work that extends the
original dynamic optimal tax literature by allowing individuals’choices to a¤ect their own ability
levels (see Casey Rothschild and Florian Scheuer 2011 or Michael Best and Henrik Kleven 2013,
for example).5
The core conceptual contribution of this paper is to take into account the dynamic interaction
between exogenous and endogenous components of skill heterogeneity.6 We consider how choices by
parents a¤ect the abilities taken as given by their children, and how these abilities in turn a¤ect the
set of choices available to children. This interaction is a central factor in policy design, in that it is
the crux of the tradeo¤ between redistributing to the poor later (i.e. equalizing the distribution of
outcomes) and investing in their skills now (i.e. equalizing the distribution of opportunities). Our
…ndings suggest one way in which society might increase equality of both outcomes and opportunities. That is, if future skill levels among the poor can be increased through current transfers, the
net bene…t of those transfers to society will be increased. Though its application is most apparent
across generations, the interaction between natural ability and human capital investments is also
relevant for issues such as the design of life-cycle tax and training policies and social insurance
programs.7
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 describes the model. Section 2 derives analytical
conditions that describe the optimal policy both within and across generations. Section 3 calibrates
the model to existing U.S. tax policy and new empirical evidence on the transmission of ability
5

Other examples include the following. Marek Kapicka (2006a, 2006b) allows a deterministic skill process to be
endogenous. Borys Grochulski and Tomasz Piskorski (2010) allow a population of identical agents to choose a human
capital investment, the output and depreciation of which are stochastic, thus combining stochasticity with a form of
endogeneity. Dan Anderberg (2009) extends that approach by allowing for heterogeneous ability shocks, the e¤ects
of which on earnings can be magni…ed or reduced by human capital investment undertaken by identical agents before
the ability shocks are realized.
6
Kapicka (2006a,b) has heterogeneity in natural ability, but each type is …xed for life, and all types share the same
human capital production function. Grochulski and Piskorski (2010) have no heterogeneity outside of shocks to the
human capital production function, the returns to which are therefore not dependent on natural ability. Anderberg
(2009) has human capital and an exogenous shock interact, but human capital investment decisions are made by
agents before their ability heterogeneity is realized.
7
Modeling this interaction is challenging, however, and one technical contribution of this paper is a novel formal
simpli…cation of the dynamics of the endogenous ability distribution. Rather than having parental resources directly
a¤ect the levels of children’s abilities, we locate the e¤ects of parental resources on the distribution of children across
a …xed set of abilities. In combination with history-independence, the natural assumption that taxes on individuals
do not depend on the income of their parents or children, our use of a …xed set of abilities with an endogenous
distribution rather than an endogenous set of abilities substantially simpli…es the computations of the optimal policy.
The alternative approach, in which types vary continuously with parental resources, means that a planner has to
specify allocations for all possible deviation paths. This technique may prove useful in other contexts.

across generations. Section 4 uses the calibrated model to simulate and characterize both the
structure and welfare implications of optimal tax policy in our context. Section 5 concludes. An
Appendix contains details of the analytical and empirical results.

Model

The formal model largely follows the standard setup of modern dynamic Mirrleesian analysis. Individuals obtain utility from consumption and disutility from exerting work e¤ort. Each individual
has an unobservable ability to earn income, which he or she combines with an unobservable level
of work e¤ort to determine pre-tax income, which is observable. The social planner designs a tax
system that generates a mapping from pre-tax income to disposable income. Individuals optimally
choose work e¤ort knowing this tax system, and thereby produce income, pay taxes, and enjoy
the remaining disposable income as consumption. We assume no intergenerational transfers, so
disposable income equals consumption for each generation.
The intergenerational focus of this paper requires some additional structure.8 Individuals are
linked in families, with one individual per generation in each family. Generations are indexed by
t 2 f1; 2; :::; T g. Each individual’s unobservable ability is taken from a …xed set of possible values,
or "types," indexed by i 2 f1; 2; :::; Ig. The distribution of individuals across types is exogenous
in the …rst generation, but in subsequent generations it is endogenous and is a function of the
distribution of disposable income in the previous generation as well as of the inheritance of type.

1.1

Planner’s problem

As in standard optimal tax analysis, we model the social planner as specifying a menu of allocations
of earned income y and disposable income c. We describe here the planner’s problem in the case
in which children’s ability may depend on parents’resources (but not on parents’time allocation);
we later explore the results in the case in which children’s ability also depends on parents’ time
allocation. By the Revelation Principle we can restrict attention to menus in which the planner
intends a speci…c (yti ; cit ) bundle for each type i in each generation t. These allocations may di¤er
across generations. The planner’s objective is to maximize social welfare. Following the standard
8
The Mirrlees model’s emphasis on ability is particularly well-suited to addressing the heart of the issue in this
paper–namely, how parental resources a¤ect the opportunities available to children.

6

approach, we de…ne social welfare as the present-value utility of the population of families starting
from the …rst generation; that is, the objective is Utilitarian. The planner’s maximization problem
is constrained in two ways: …rst, feasibility, specifying that disposable income must be funded by
output; second, incentive compatibility, specifying that individuals choose optimally among the
o¤ered bundles (i.e. maximize their own utility taking the tax system as given).
We also impose the constraint that taxes may depend on only the current generation’s characteristics and choices. In other words, taxes are restricted to be independent of history and cannot
depend on the income of the taxpayer’s parents or children. This restriction is standard, as well as
convenient, in a variety of dynamic optimal tax contexts such as Kapicka’s (2006) analysis of human
capital. Moreover, history independence captures the explicit tax system in a realistic way: no tax
system does or, we conjecture, ever will levy taxes on a child that depend in any direct way on that
child’s parents’characteristics. There seems to be a normative aversion to such history-dependence
across generations, so we will impose it on the policy here.
Some aspects of policy, such as subsidies for children’s education like 529 education savings
plans, may seem to violate our assumption of history dependence because they condition policy on
parents’resources. The bulk of these incentives lie outside of and are small relative to the overall
history-independent tax and transfer system. More importantly, these policies do not condition on
the income of the child, a necessary component of history-dependent policies. To see this, note that
an optimal history-dependent tax policy in this model would condition redistributive transfers to
low earners in one generation on whether their parents were low or high earners. In particular, it
would reduce transfers to those low earners whose parents were high ability, thereby discouraging
those parents from underinvesting in their children.9 Policies such as 529 savings plans, even if
conditioned on parental income levels, are qualitatively di¤erent, because they do not depend on
the child’s earnings. In fact, these policies are similar to the supplements to parental resources
that our results recommend. Of course, our assumption of history independence is nevertheless
a simpli…cation, and understanding the impact of realistic intergenerational history dependence
would be a valuable avenue for future research.
Formally, the planner’s problem is as follows:
9

Or, it would tax more lightly those high earners whose parents were low earners, to encourage this investment.
Note that taxes on bequests or inter vivos gifts are potential targets for such history-dependent taxation, though
they are usually history-independent in reality.

Limitations

Some apparent limitations of the setup deserve clari…cation.
First, while the setup has the same measure of parental resources serve as the quantity of
consumption in the parent’s utility function and the input to the child’s ability production function,
we are not asserting that the way in which parental disposable income is used is irrelevant to their
child’s ability. Rather, we are guided not only by tractability but also by the data. Our empirical
evidence concerns the e¤ect on a child’s ability of transfers to parents; we have no data on how
those transfers were allocated. In order to calibrate to this evidence, our model must also leave
the allocation of these transfers unspeci…ed. We use the term disposable income, rather than
8

consumption, to make this aspect of our analysis clear. In principle, one could attempt to use the
limited available data on the division of parental expenditure into consumption and investment in
children’s abilities to model more subtle optimal policies. Identifying the separate e¤ects of these
categories of expenditure on children’s ability would not be possible using our data and identi…cation
strategy (as studying the causal e¤ect of the EITC on di¤erent categories of consumption is severely
limited by empirical power issues (Gelber and Mitchell 2012)). Moreover, the appeal of more subtle
policy that distinguished between these categories would be diminished by incentives for (largely
unobservable) misreporting of spending across categories.
Second, we assume in the problem above that the allocation of parental time has no e¤ect on
children’s abilities. We later explore the case in which children’s ability depends on both parental
income and parents’ hours worked. If parents work more, they could spend less time with their
children. This in principle could either worsen children’s outcomes (if, say, parents teach children
skills in their non-work time) or could improve children’s outcomes (if, say, parents’increased work
serves as a role model for children’s work in school). We …nd that, on net, parental time allocation
has only a small e¤ect on our baseline results. However, as we discuss, our empirical estimate of
the e¤ect of parents’hours worked on children’s ability is more suggestive than our estimate of the
e¤ect of parent income.
Third, only tax policy is modeled in this paper, but that does not imply that other policies play
no role. Our empirical estimates take as given the existing set of non-tax policies and institutions,
such as schools, that have e¤ects on children’s abilities (including e¤ects that may interact with the
tax system). Our model implicitly assumes that these policies and institutions are held constant
as taxes vary, again an assumption we make to match the empirical evidence to which we calibrate
the model.
Fourth, in the terminology of Becker and H. Gregg Lewis (1973), we assume that quality of
children is valued and a¤ected by parental resources, but we abstract from the e¤ect of resources
on the quantity of children. Valuing new lives is beyond the scope of this paper.
Finally, we do not constrain parent and child distributions of ability to be the same, as they
might be in some steady state. Again, we are motivated by the data: wage distributions have shown
secular time trends in the data across generations (e.g. Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz 2007),
and test scores have secularly increased over time as in the well-known "Flynn e¤ect" (e.g. James
Flynn 1987).

Analysis of optimal policy

Our analysis of the planner’s problem in expressions (1) through (5) generates two results. First,
we characterize the distortion to an individual’s choice of how much to earn, the classic subject of
optimal tax analyses since Mirrlees (1971). Second, we derive a necessary condition on optimal allocations across generations that modi…es the conventional model’s recommendation in an intuitive
but powerful way.

2.1

Optimal marginal distortion to earned income

The classic object of study in optimal tax models is the marginal tax rate, or the distortion
to the individual’s marginal choice between disposable income and leisure. Formally, the ratio
v 0 yti =wti =[wti u0 cit ] equals one if an individual sets the marginal disutility of labor equal to the
marginal utility of consuming the income that labor earns. Any factor reducing the marginal utility
of earnings (such as a positive marginal tax rate) causes this ratio to be less than one, distorting
the individual’s choice of labor e¤ort.
In the model above, in the absence of taxes, parent i in generation t would solve her own
planning problem. Formally, she would choose how much income to earn to maximize her own
utility subject to a personal feasibility constraint and given the expectation that her descendants,
whose abilities are determined by the production function pj wti ; cit , will also choose optimally for
themselves. That parent’s optimal private choice will satisfy the following condition:
v 0 yti =wti
=1+
wti u0 cit

j
X @pj wti ; cit Ut+1
:
@cit
u0 cit

(6)

To see this result, take the …rst-order conditions of expression (2), the utility of parent i in generation
t, with respect to cit and yti , subject to the no-tax condition that cit = yti , and simplify. In words,
parents take into account the e¤ect of their disposable income on their child’s ability, so they will
appear to choose labor supply as though there were a marginal subsidy equal to the second term
on the right-hand side of expression (6), relative to a model in which they took only their own
disposable income into account. Recall that the right-hand side equals one in a conventional model
without endogenous ability distributions.
Lemma 1 (proved in the Appendix) establishes that the planner’s …rst-order conditions for cit

setting to two simpler, hypothetical benchmarks. Note that, because none of these expressions is in
closed form–that is, they include endogenous allocations of utility, disposable income, and income
as well as constraint multipliers–comparing outcomes under di¤erent model settings can be only
partial equilibrium in nature. We identify three e¤ects.
First, suppose the planner had full information on individuals’(endogenous) abilities. In that
case, expressions (9) through (11) would imply that Bjt =

and Cjt = Djt = 0. Then, the wedge

would be simply Ajt , the value of which depends on the present value of the expected net revenue

It is important to be clear about our terminology. By "distorting" the parent’s choice, we mean simply that the
condition characterizing the planner’s …rst-order condition (7) is di¤erent than the condition (6) characterizing the
parent’s choice.

gain from raising the disposable income of parent j. In particular, the gain is the weighted present
value sum of net revenues obtained across types over time, with the weight on type k in generation
t + 1 representing the increase in probability that children of parent type j will be type k when cjt
is increased slightly. The planner values that revenue gain, while the parent does not. Intuitively,
larger Ajt means that the planner generates greater net revenue gain from having the parent obtain
a larger disposable income, implying that optimal policy entails a smaller downward distortion (or
larger upward distortion) to parent j’s e¤ort. We call this factor the "revenue e¤ect." To the extent
that the marginal e¤ect of additional parental disposable income on children’s abilities is larger for
lower-ability parents, this revenue e¤ect will be greater at low incomes, and smaller marginal taxes11
at low incomes will be optimal.
Second, suppose the planner cannot observe ability, but parental resources have no e¤ect on children’s abilities–in other words, the conventional Mirrlees model. In that case, @pk wtj ; cjt =@cjt = 0,
so Ajt = 1. Then, the wedge would be simply Bjt + Cjt = Bjt + Djt . In that conventional setting,
P j 0 jj P jjj 0
Bjt = t jt , and Cjt = j 0 t
j 0 t , and the optimal distortion is driven by binding incentive
constraints in the current generation. Note that Cjt < Djt when higher-skilled types are tempted to
mimic lower-skilled types, so this ratio is less than one, which implies a positive marginal tax rate
in the conventional setting.
Introducing endogenous, unobservable ability has two e¤ects on the optimal intratemporal
wedge in addition to the revenue e¤ect identi…ed above. In particular, both Bjt and Cjt take on more
complicated values than in either of these simpler benchmark cases.12 We call these two e¤ects the
"relative return e¤ect" and the "ancestor incentive e¤ect" to aid in intuition.
The "relative return e¤ect" relates to the value of Cjt , which captures how the di¤erential
value of extra disposable income to parents of di¤erent abilities interacts with the distortionary
tax system. In particular, while Cjt < Djt in a conventional model when higher-skilled types are
tempted to mimic lower-skilled types, including endogenous ability will increase the relative size of
Cjt if the marginal e¤ect of additional parental disposable income on children’s abilities is larger for
0

lower-ability parents, holding allocations constant.13 To see this, suppose that wj > wj , so that
@ 2 pk (wtj ;cjt )
type j 0 is the higher type. If
= 0, implying that the marginal e¤ect of parental resources
j
j

11

Throughout this section, we use the terminology of distortions and marginal taxes interchangeably. This assumes
an implementation of the distortions through an explicit tax system, which is straightforward in our setting without
capital.
12
The term Djt+s is unchanged from the conventional model, unless parental work e¤ort enters the child’s ability
production function. We explore that case below.
13
Technically, this holds if the weighted sum of these e¤ects, weighted by eventual child type, is larger.

is independent of parental ability, then Cjt is unchanged from in the stand ard model, while if
@ 2 pk (wtj ;cjt )
< 0, implying that the marginal e¤ect of parental resources is decreasing in parental
j
j
@ct @wt

ability, then Cjt increases. Meanwhile, Djt is unchanged. When Cjt and Djt have more similar values,
the optimal marginal taxes on low-skilled parents are smaller. Intuitively, if the extra resources
granted to low-income families are of less value to high-ability (and thus high-income) parents,
high-income parents will be less tempted in this model to claim low ability than in a standard
model, so smaller distortions at low incomes will be required.
The "ancestor incentive e¤ect" relates to the value of Bjt , which measures how an increase in
cjt a¤ects the incentive problems of taxing earlier generations who can a¤ect the probability that
0

their descendants have the type j. For example, suppose wi > wi , so that type i0 is the higher
0

type in generation , and wj > wj , so that type j 0 is the higher type in generation t. In this case,
j
t jci

>

j
t jci0 ,

i0 ji

= 0, and

iji0

> 0, so that Bjt is smaller, and the optimal marginal distortion is

larger, for low-skilled types in a model with endogenous ability than in a model without. Intuitively,
a smaller distortion on a low-skilled type raises the temptation for previous generations to work
less and produce low-skilled descendants. The same logic holds in reverse: if j is a high skill type,
j
t jci

<

j
t jci0 ,

i0 ji

= 0, and

iji0

> 0: Then, Bjt is larger and the marginal distortion is smaller

for high-skilled types. Intuitively, we should decrease the marginal distortion on type j if doing so
reduces earlier generations’ incentive problems. In this way, the ancestor incentive e¤ect pushes
against the revenue and relative return e¤ects, serving to increase marginal taxes at low incomes.
In the end, as this discussion and the previously-mentioned endogeneity of the allocations in
these expressions suggest, the e¤ect on optimal distortions of introducing endogenous ability is
ambiguous. To get a sense for this ambiguity, consider the case of a low-ability parent. If parental
resources have greater marginal e¤ects on the children of low-skilled parents, then A and C are
likely to be larger for these parents, reducing the optimal distortion due to the revenue and relative
return e¤ects. At the same time, B is likely to be smaller because increasing this low-skilled parent’s
resources makes it harder to incentivize previous generations to exert e¤ort, increasing the optimal
distortion due to the ancestor incentive e¤ect. On net, the optimal distortion could be smaller or
larger than in the conventional model.
Further intuition can be obtained by examining the case of only two ability types. In the case
of two ability types, only one of the incentive constraints will bind within any given generation,
allowing us to write result (7) more concisely for each ability type. We provide those expressions
in the Appendix.
13

One of the lessons of Lemma 1 is that a two-period version of the model in this paper would
obscure key aspects of the optimal policy problem. To see this, consider the two novel terms in the
lemma, Ajt and Bjt . Ajt depends on how a marginal increase in current disposable income a¤ects the
tax revenue raised from all future generations. Bjt depends on the incentive constraint multipliers
for all previous generations. Any two-period model will neglect one of these two channels.

Allocations across generations

This condition, parallel to the Symmetric Inverse Euler Equation in Weinzierl (2011), shows that
the optimal allocation equalizes the cost, in disposable income units, of raising social welfare across
generations. A version of it also applies to optimal tagging, such as in N. Gregory Mankiw and
Weinzierl (2010).
With endogenous ability, expression (12) may not hold. Instead, a modi…ed version of it applies,
which we state in the following proposition and derive in the Appendix.14
14
Note that results (12) and (13) will hold for the special case in which consumption for each type and the ability
distribution across types are exactly constant, regardless of whether the corresponding allocation is optimal from a
welfare standpoint. Thus, these results are necessary but not su¢ cient qualities of the optimal policies (without and
with endogenous ability, respectively).

To understand Proposition 1 intuitively, recall the meaning of the Symmetric Inverse Euler
Equation in expression (12), namely that the cost of raising social welfare through transfers to one
generation must be the same for all generations. Proposition 1 is the same condition, but in the
more complicated context of this model economy. In a conventional model, the average inverse
marginal utility of disposable income in a generation determines the cost of raising welfare through
transfers to a generation. In our model, that cost also depends on three novel factors that we now
discuss.
First, if the transfer raises individual j 0 s investment in her children’s abilities, resulting in
increased tax revenue from future generations, these revenue gains o¤set the costs of the transfer.

Formally, this factor is captured in the expression

related to the revenue e¤ect identi…ed in the discussion of Lemma 1. This expression is the present
value of the net change in future taxes paid by individual j 0 s children when cjt increases.
Second, if the transfer raises individual j 0 s investment in her children’s abilities, resulting in increased utilities for future generations, these welfare gains augment any direct changes in utility from

the transfer. Formally, this factor is captured in the expression

k

This expression is the present value, per additional unit of utility for individual j, of the increase
in utility enjoyed by individual j 0 s children when cjt increases.
Third, both the relative return and ancestor incentive e¤ects from the discussion of Lemma
1 matter for intertemporal allocations as well, i.e., through their e¤ects on

t.

Note that

t

is

equal to one when two conditions hold: the marginal e¤ect of parental …nancial resources on child
0

ability is independent of parental ability (i.e., @pk wtj ; cjt =@cjt = @pk wtj ; cjt =@cjt for all j; j 0 ),
15

and incentive constraints do not bind in preceding generations (i.e.,

i0 ji

= 0 for all ; i; i0 ): If,

instead, transfers to a generation relax incentive constraints15 that were preventing low-income
parents from having the disposable income to make relatively high-return investments in their
children, the expression

t

is less than one. Similarly, if transfers to a generation relax incentive

constraints that bind on ancestors whose o¤spring are relatively common in the recipient generation,
the expression

t

is less than one. The smaller is

t,

the larger is the optimal transfer to generation

t. Intuitively, the more that binding incentive constraints are preventing investments in children in
either the current or preceding generations, the more the planner wants to use transfers to relax
those incentive constraints.
As one might expect, the overall implications of these three novel factors for optimal policy are
theoretically ambiguous; to build intuition for their e¤ects, consider a speci…c, empirically plausible
scenario. Namely, suppose that mean ability is stable over time and the e¤ects of parental resources
on a child’s ability are largest at lower skill levels.16 Conventional policy designed to satisfy the
expression (12) would treat generations symmetrically, and those allocations would satisfy equation
(13). However, that conventional policy fails to take advantage of the endogeneity of the ability
distribution.
Consider, instead, a policy that transfers resources from generation t + 1 to generation t and,
in particular, increases the resources available to the low-ability workers in generation t. Such a
policy would violate the conventional expression (12), as it would lower the marginal utilities of
disposable income for generation t and raise them for generation t + 1, increasing the left-hand side
and decreasing the right-hand side of (12). Intuitively, the conventional perspective implies that
the relative cost of raising welfare under such a policy is too high in the recipient generation t; the
resources ought to stay with the future generation.
Such a policy is consistent with the true optimal policy condition (13), however, because of
endogenous ability. To see why, note that the policy will increase the population proportion of
higher-ability workers in generation t + 1. This shift in the distribution of

k
t+1

will put greater

weights on workers with larger inverse marginal utilities of disposable income and smaller gains in
future revenue and utility for their descendants from marginal resources. As a result, transfers from
generation t + 1 to generation t increase the cost of raising social welfare in generation t + 1. This
15
That in the usual way, i.e., high-ability parents are tempted to claim lower ability to obtain a more generous tax
treatment.

o¤sets what seemed to be a problem, namely that those transfers increased the cost of raising social
welfare in generation t by directly lowering marginal utilities of income. Mathematically, then, this
policy will increase both the left-hand and right-hand sides of (13). Therefore, equation (13) may
be satis…ed with a policy that treats generations asymmetrically and generates greater welfare. In
other words, transfers from future to earlier generations generate gains for all generations: early
generations gain from having higher disposable incomes, and future generations gain from having
improved ability distributions.
This example implies that an optimal policy making use of the endogeneity of the ability
distribution may di¤er from the conventionally-optimal policy. While result (13) does not prove
that such a superior policy equilibrium exists, the simulations of Section 4 show that the scenario
described above …ts the empirical evidence from the United States, and that the potential welfare
gains from such a policy are substantial.

2.3

Labor as an input to children’s ability

As we discuss above, it is also possible that children’s ability could depend on parents’hours worked.
If children’s ability depends on their parents’ hours worked, the planner’s problem includes the
dependence of p ( ) on labor e¤ort (or, equivalently, time not devoted to labor e¤ort).

The main di¤erences once parental labor e¤ort enters the child ability production function are

is detrimental to child ability, so that

< 0. First, the term Ajt now captures that

extra parental e¤ort will lower future revenues, so the optimal downward distortion to labor e¤ort
is larger (i.e. the term Ajt is smaller). Second, if extra parental time at work is more detrimental
to child ability for low-ability parents, then Djt will be smaller. This reduces the optimal distortion
on lower types. Intuitively, incentive constraints are looser with this e¤ect, because high-skilled
parents gain relatively less from the lower labor e¤ort requirements they would enjoy if they claimed
a low income. In the Appendix, we show that including parental time as modeled here has only
small e¤ects on the results from our baseline quantitative analysis, which we describe in the next
Section.

Model calibration under existing U.S. tax policy

In this section, we calibrate the model of Section 1 to estimates of the e¤ect of parental resources
on children’s ability under existing U.S. tax policy. We focus our calibration on matching empirical
estimates of statistics related to the transmission of ability across generations under the status quo
tax policy. In particular, we minimize the distance (i.e. sum of squared deviations) between the
model’s output and the empirical estimates of the marginal e¤ects of parental resources on their
children’s abilities, the transition matrix between generations, and the expected log wage within
generations.

3.1

Empirical estimates of the target statistics

We adapt to our framework the empirical work from a recent major study of parents’ taxes and
children’s outcomes. Dahl and Lochner (forthcoming) study the e¤ect of expansions of the EITC
in the 1990s on children’s test score outcomes.17 Rather than calibrating our model using a crosssection of data, we use a modi…ed version of the Dahl and Lochner empirical strategy in order to
generate more credible estimates of the causal e¤ect of parental income on child ability (as estimating such credible e¤ects is the focus of their study). Their study examines a speci…c context, and
we must generalize outside of the speci…c features of this context with caution. While recognizing
this caveat, we choose to examine this context because we believe that it represents one of the best
available opportunities to study the e¤ect of tax policy toward parents on children’s outcomes in
the United States. We refer readers to their paper for a full description of their empirical strategy
and its motivation, but we brie‡y describe their empirical strategy here, often borrowing from their
description of it.
The size of the EITC, which is a refundable tax credit primarily bene…tting low- and middle17

See Joseph Hotz and Karl Scholz (2003) or Nada Eissa and Hilary Hoynes (2005) for detailed descriptions of
the EITC program and a summary of related research. The marginal e¤ect of parental resources on child ability is
di¢ cult to estimate for at least two reasons. First, it is di¢ cult to …nd plausibly exogenous variation in parents’
disposable income levels. Second, it is di¢ cult to …nd data on parents’ disposable income and wage levels linked
to measures of their children’s outcomes. Several papers have estimated the e¤ect of parents’ income on their
children’s achievement levels (e.g. Dahl and Lochner forthcoming; Kevin Milligan and Mark Stabile forthcoming;
Christine Paxson and Norbert Schady 2007; Randall Akee, William Copeland, Gordon Keeler, Adrian Angold, and
Jane Costello 2010; Katrine Løken, Magne Mogstad, and Matthew Wiswall 2012; Karen Macours, Schady, and Renos
Vakis 2012). However, they have not estimated the e¤ect of parents’ disposable income on children’s wage rates in
large part because linking the income of children’s parents when the children were young to children’s wage outcomes
when they have grown into adults requires a long panel of data in which all of these variables are linked. This
coincidence of data is unlikely in circumstances with suitable exogenous variation in parents’disposable income. In
fact, our paper suggests a new empirical object of interest that should be studied in future work: the e¤ect of parents’
disposable income on children’s wages.

20

income families, depends on earned income and the number of qualifying children. The EITC tax
schedule has three regions. Over the “phase-in” range, a percentage of earnings is transferred to
individuals. Over the “plateau” region, an individual receives the maximum credit, after which
the credit is reduced (eventually to zero) in the "phase-out" region. Near the period studied in
this paper, the EITC was expanded substantially in the tax acts of 1986, 1990, and 1993. The
largest expansion of the EITC was in 1993. This reform increased the additional maximum bene…t
for taxpayers with two or more children, which reached $1400 in 1996. The phase-in rate for the
lowest-income recipients increased from 18.5% to 34% for families with one child and from 19.5%
to 40% for families with two or more children.
Dahl and Lochner ask how the EITC and other tax and transfer programs a¤ect the cognitive
achievement of disadvantaged children through their e¤ects on parental income. Their estimation
strategy is based on the observation that low- to middle-income families received large increases in
payments from expansions of the EITC in the late-1980s and mid-1990s but higher-income families
did not. If parental disposable income a¤ects child ability, this disparity in the changes to disposable
income should have caused an increase over time in the test scores of children from low-to-middle
income families relative to those from higher income families.
Dahl and Lochner’s analysis uses the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
which contain data on several thousand children matched to their mothers (from the main NLSY
sample). Income and demographic measures are included in the data, in addition to as many as
four repeated measures of cognitive test scores per child taken every other year. The data are longitudinal, implying that it is possible to …rst-di¤erence the data to remove child …xed e¤ects. They
use measures of child ability based on standardized scores on the Peabody Individual Achievement
Tests (PIAT), which measures oral reading ability, mathematics ability, word recognition ability,
and reading comprehension. Dahl and Lochner’s instrumental variables estimates suggest that a
$1,000 increase in family income raises math and reading test scores by about 6% of a standard
deviation.18
We estimate a model similar to Dahl and Lochner’s, using the same basic sample of data they
use (described more fully in their paper and in the Appendix), but we use it to obtain a slightly
di¤erent empirical object. Motivated by our model above and simulation below, we estimate the
e¤ect that income has on the probability that a parent of given ability type produces a child of a
given ability type (controlling for the child’s lagged ability type). We present summary statistics in
18

We use year 2000 dollars throughout.

21

Appendix Table 1 and run preliminary regressions— shown and discussed in detail in the Appendix
to demonstrate the viability of our approach–in Appendix Tables 2 and 3.
In our main speci…cation, we divide parents into four wage (ability) categories fPi g4i=1 and

divide children into four test score categories fCi g4i=1 . Each category comprises one quartile of the
sample distribution of wages or test scores, respectively, with subscript i indicating the quartile
of the distribution, where i = 1 is the lowest quartile. Because there are four parent types, we
estimate four separate regressions, in each of which the dependent variable is a dummy that equals
one when the child has ability in the i-th category. We classify parents into wage types by ranking
them according to their average wage over the full sample period.
In choosing the number of categories, we take into account competing technical and conceptual
considerations: more categories will give the calibration more targets as well as better describe the
true heterogeneity of the population and, therefore, the potential gains from optimal policy; but
too many categories will prevent the regressions in the empirical estimation from having enough
positive values of the dependent variable to yield meaningful results. It turns out that using too

few categories fails to provide enough empirical targets for the calibration exercise to converge on a
best set of parameter values: this factor requires us to use at least four categories. Elsewhere in the
Appendix, we also show results with …ve and ten categories. Those results show heterogeneity in
tax rates at a …ner level of disaggregation at the cost of a substantial loss of power in the empirical
estimates. Our analyses with …ve and ten types yield similar results as does our benchmark fourtype model. The Appendix describes our speci…cation and data in detail.
In Appendix Table 4, for each regression, we show the estimated marginal e¤ects of parental resources on their children’s abilities, with standard errors in parentheses. The signs of the coe¢ cients
in Appendix Table 4 generally conform to expectations: higher parental income predominantly increases the probability that a child is high-ability (i.e. in the third or fourth quartile) and decreases
the probability that a child is low-ability (i.e. in the …rst or second quartile), with the "correct"
sign of the relationship occurring in 13 out of 16 regressions. Moreover, in the three cases in which
the relationship takes the "wrong" sign, only one of these point estimates shows a non-negligible
e¤ect: only one shows that the e¤ect of a 1% increase in parental income causes a change in the
child’s probability of being in a given a category larger than 0.1 percentage point. The regressions
in Appendix Table 5 additionally control for the …rst-di¤erence of parent hours worked and show
a very small impact of parent hours on child ability, as we discuss further in the Appendix.
In addition to the estimates in Appendix Table 4, our calibration targets the elements of the
22

empirical ability transition matrix between generations and the expected log wage within a generation. Using the same dataset and de…nition of types as in the analysis just described, we can
readily generate the transition matrix by calculating the fraction of the sample from each parent
wage category who began the sample period with the child test score in each category. The results
are in Appendix Table 6.19 The mean log wage is also readily calculated, as the average of the log
of the four ability levels shown above, to be 2.07.

3.2

Model speci…cation

We next describe how the model produces quantities corresponding to these target statistics, and
we specify some components of the model required for simulation.
The quantities corresponding to the targeted statistics are generated by the model as follows.
In the planner’s problem, the production function for a child’s ability was left unspeci…ed. Here,
we impose a particular, tractable form:20 the expected ability of the child of a parent of type j
0

with disposable income cj1 is
i
h
0
E ln wt+1 jwtj ; cjt =

a

ln wtj + (1

) ln w +

j
c

0

ln cjt :

(20)

Expression (20) shows that the child’s expected ability is a function of the parent’s ability, a
…xed "reference" ability level, and the parent’s disposable income. The child’s expected ability is
in‡uenced by the parent’s ability wtj relative to the …xed ability level w, indicating mean reversion
in characteristics transmitted across generations (consistent with the empirical evidence on income,

This log-linear functional form concisely captures the basic forces at work in this model determining the transmission of ability across generations. Namely, it allows us to adjust the role of
parental ability in determining a child’s ability through the parameter . It also allows us to vary
the relative importance of this channel and a second channel, parental resources, by adjusting the
parameters

a

and

j
c.

Note that the dependence of

j
c,

the parameter controlling the importance of

parental disposable income, on j, the parental ability type, establishes a direct connection between
the exogenous and endogenous components of the ability production function.

We do not show the standard errors on these estimates, as they are nearly uniform at approximately 0.01.
In (20) and elsewhere, in the model speci…cation we make several assumptions for the sake of tractability. This
fact notwithstanding, we view our model speci…cation and calibration as demonstration that taking into account the
e¤ect of parents’resources on children’s abilities can have important implications for optimal tax policy.

assumed production function for child ability allows

varies with j— a relationship we will estimate in our simulations—

the marginal value of parental resources may increase, be constant, decrease, or exhibit complex
nonlinearities as innate ability increases.21
We translate the expected ability in expression (20) into an ability distribution for the pop0

ulation of children of parents of type j with disposable income cjt by assuming that ability is

The ability distribution over the income range relevant to this paper is commonly calibrated as
lognormal (e.g. Tuomala 1990). The variance

2

represents an exogenous, stochastic shock to child

ability common across parent types.
The simulations of this model will use a discrete distribution of abilities, consistent with the
model described in Section 1, whereas expressions (20) and (21) appear to produce continuous
ability distributions. To classify individuals into I discrete types, we de…ne …xed ranges of w that
correspond to each type i 2 I. By "…xed," we mean that the boundary values of w that determine
whether an individual is assigned wage wi or wi+1 are exogenously given. With these …xed ranges,
we can translate the distribution of ability for a given child implied by expression (21) into transition
probabilities among types across generations.22
Applying this procedure, we can generate the transition probabilities

k j
t+1 cjt

for all parent and

child types. This structure also enables us to calculate the marginal e¤ects of parental disposable
income as the increase in the probability of a given child type caused by an increase of one percent in
a given parent type’s disposable income. Formally, to compute the marginal e¤ect of cj , we calculate
the semi-elasticity of the probability of each child type with respect to parental disposable income.
That is, we calculate the change in the probability of each child type associated with an incremental
21

We do not estimate this production function directly using our empirical approach because our empirical approach
relies on a …xed e¤ects speci…cation, which would di¤erence out parent ability. Our regression speci…cation estimates
a coe¢ cient on parental income that is comparable to the coe¢ cient on parental income in (20) :
22
An example may help clarify the procedure. Suppose I = 2, so that there are two ability types. Denote the …xed
wage level that separates types 1 and 2 as w . A mother of type j expects her child to, on average, have the ability
E ln w2 jw1j ; cj1 as de…ned by expression (20) : In reality, her child’s ability is a random variable distributed according
to N E ln w2 jw1j ; cj1 ; 2 . The probability that her child’s ability ends up in the lower half of the full distribution
of wages across all children is, therefore, the value at w of the cumulative density function implied by this normal
distribution.

Expressions (20) and (21) indicate that the model calibration will search over values of the
n oI
following parameters:
; a ; jc
;
, such that with I = 4 there are seven values to estimate.
j=1

As a baseline case, we will impose

= 0:5 for the parameter controlling the transmission of ability

across generations. This assumption is based on the voluminous evidence surveyed in Marcus
Feldman, Sarah Otto, and Freddy Christiansen 2000.23 We show the robustness of our results to
this choice in the Appendix. We also impose the value of

= 0:76; which we calculate using data

on wages from the NLSY sample. This leaves …ve parameters to be chosen by this calibration.
Finally, before proceeding with the calibration, we specify the tax system facing individuals,
the utility function those individuals maximize, and the set of ability types. For the status quo
tax system, we assume that the Kotliko¤ and Rapson (2007) calculations of marginal e¤ective tax
rates on income for 30-year-old couples in the United States in 2005 are a good approximation of
the status quo tax policy facing parents of young children. These authors’detailed calculations go
well beyond statutory personal income tax schedules and include a wide array of transfer programs
(such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and low-income bene…t programs such
as the Earned Income Tax Credit) as well as corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and state
and local income and sales taxes. Our computational procedure requires a smooth tax function,
so we take a …fth-order polynomial approximation of the Kotliko¤-Rapson schedule over annual
incomes up to $75,000, a level well above the point at which the EITC is fully phased out. (Other
polynomial approximations, including a third-order polynomial approximation, yield very similar
results). This approximation and the corresponding original Kotliko¤-Rapson estimates are shown
in Figure 1.
23

Feldman et al. …nd a range of heritability estimates from 0.28 to 0.38 (their h2 ) and a "cultural transmission"
estimate (their b2 ) of 0.27 (see their Table 4.3). The mapping between these channels and our "ability" channel is
imperfect. The two channels together could explain nearly two-thirds of the variance in a characteristic. But while
all of the former channel is contained with our notion of "ability," it is not clear that all of the latter is so contained.
We use 0.50 as a reasonable middle ground.

25

Figure 1: E¤ective marginal tax rates in the U.S.

Note that our data do not allow us to extend our calibration directly to higher incomes, a limitation
that could, in principle, a¤ect our results because both the existing and optimal tax policies would
redistribute substantial resources from higher earners. We show an extension of our analysis in the
Appendix that suggests our results are robust to this potential concern.
The government’s tax system also includes a grant to all individuals, which is constant across
generations, as are tax rates. As in the feasibility constraint on the planner, expression (3), the
government’s budget is balanced in present value, where we set

= 1:00, re‡ecting no discounting

of utility across generations. In the Appendix, we show that our results are robust to a modest
degree of discounting, but note that there is no growth in this economy, so any discounting re‡ects
solely a preference for the utility of earlier generations.

form for the sake of tractability and because it helps in illustrating the key features of the model in
a straightforward way. We set

= 3 to be consistent with mainstream estimates of these

parameters (which implies that the Frisch elasticity of labor supply is 12 ). We choose

= 2:5 so that

hours worked in the simulation approximately match the average labor supply in the population.24
Finally, guided by the empirical analysis discussed above, we assume ability comes in I = 4
…xed types (roughly interpretable as the hourly wage):25 wti 2 f3:44, 6:30, 9:42, 19:57g for all
t = f1; 2; :::; T g. The probability distribution across those types is uniform in the …rst generation
but is endogenously determined in the model for subsequent generations.26

Calibration Results

To calibrate the model, we minimize a weighted sum of squared errors, where the targets are the
marginal e¤ects and transition matrix shown in Appendix Tables 4 and 6 as well as the mean log
wage. We weight the squared errors by the inverse of the targets’standard errors, which has the
e¤ect of putting much greater weight on the more-precisely-estimated transition matrix elements
and the mean log wage. We use ten generations (T = 10) in the simulations, allowing for several
generations surrounding the middle (…fth-to-sixth) generation that we use as the target for the
calibration exercise. We show robustness to this choice in the Appendix.
Table 1 shows the parameter values chosen by the simulation.

Note that we also implicitly assume that all adults’consumption has an impact on children. In the U.S. population
in 2000, 85 percent of adults over 45 have had a biological child (Health and Human Services 2002), with even larger
percentages at older ages.

The simulation does well in matching the empirical targets for which the data is most informative, namely the transition matrix and mean log wage. The simulation yields marginal e¤ects of
parental resources that di¤er substantially from the data, as Appendix Table 7 shows for the …fth
(middle) generation of the simulation. The calibrated status quo marginal e¤ects exhibit a pattern
much closer to what intuition would suggest— negative for lower child types and positive for higher
child types— than do the estimated e¤ects in the data. This is not surprising, however, given the
statistical insigni…cance of the empirical estimates and their often-unexpected signs.
Table 2 shows that the simulation closely matches the data for the transition matrix between
generations (we show the transition between the …fth and sixth generations of the simulation as an
illustrative example).28

Finally, the simulation matches the mean log wage, 2.07.
As we show in the Appendix, these results are robust to varying time discounting , the number

Løken, Mogstad, and Wiswall (2012) …nd a larger e¤ect of parental income on child achievement among lower-income
families than among higher-income families. Consistent with these …ndings, we …nd that within each parent ability
level the e¤ect of parental income on child achievement is concave.
28
The intergenerational correlation of ranks of income in Chetty et al. (2014) is only 0.34, suggesting substantial intergenerational mobility. In the Appendix, we show that if the parameter controlling the intergenerational
correlation of ability ( ) is higher, the gains from optimal policy are increased.

Optimal Policy

In this section, we simulate a many-period version of the planner’s problem using the calibration
from the previous subsection. We characterize optimal policy by comparing it to the status quo
policy used in that calibration.
Table 3 shows average and marginal tax rates for each type under the optimal and status quo
policies.29 Average tax rates are calculated as the ratio (y

c) =y. For marginal tax rates, we

compare the marginal tax rates imposed by the status quo policy to the marginal tax rates that
would implement the optimal allocation. The latter are the wedges that distort individuals’choices
of labor e¤ort. In the discussion of Lemma 1, we showed that the wedge for parent of type i in
generation t, which we denote as

i,
t

can be written as

i
t

Akt Bkt + Ct = Bkt + Dt , where

Akt ; Bkt ; Ct ; and Dt are de…ned above in expressions (8) ; (9), (10) ; and (11) :

Table 3 shows that the optimal policy has very di¤erent average and marginal tax rates than
the status quo. The optimal policy is substantially more redistributive, generating large transfers
to low-skilled parents. This result is due entirely to the redistributive preferences of the social
planner.30 Nevertheless, these redistributive transfers generate an improved ability distribution
by capitalizing on the gap between the impact of increased disposable income on the children of
low-ability parents and high-ability parents. Optimal policy imposes larger marginal distortions
(other than on the highest type) to make the allocations for lower types less attractive to those
with higher ability, who expect to have children with higher ability on average.
29

These rates–or close approximations of them–hold for all but the initial and …nal generations, which di¤er slightly
given their endpoint status.
30
If, as in a standard Mirrleesian analysis, the planner believed the starting ability distribution was …xed, the
optimal policy would generate average tax rates of [-253%, -73%, -28%, -2%, and 42%]. Therefore, the presence of
endogenous ability reduces the extent of redistribution that is optimal in a standard Utilitarian model. The intuition
for this result is that low earners in the conventionally optimal policy face high marginal tax rates, with much of
their welfare coming through increased leisure time. With endogenous ability, it can be optimal to have these workers
exert more e¤ort, earn more income, and therefore enjoy more disposable income than in a static model.

29

The optimal policy also adjusts intertemporal allocations to capitalize on the endogeneity of
ability, as was suggested in the discussion of Proposition 1. Table 4 reports the di¤erence between
the planner’s "budget balance" as a share of aggregate income in each generation under the optimal
policy and under the status quo policy. In other words, it is the additional average tax rate assessed
on each generation by the planner, relative to a balanced budget as assumed in the status quo.

Table 4 shows that the optimal policy borrows from future generations to fund greater investment
in the skills of the current generation relative to the status quo. Of course, our model abstracts
from many features of the economy, notably capital as a factor of production, some of which may
make de…cit-…nanced investment in children less appealing. However, the key point illustrated by
Table 4 is that society can bene…t by having later generations contribute, through higher taxes, to
improving the ability distribution generated by earlier generations.31
These di¤erences in tax policy a¤ect the evolution of the ability distribution. We report the
transition matrices for types across generations under the optimal and status quo policies. Table 5
repeats the transition matrix from Table 2 for the calibrated status quo model and compares it to
the transition matrix under the optimal policy.

The United States is running substantial yearly budget de…cits as of 2013 and did in 2005 when the Kotliko¤ and
Rapson tax rates are calculated. Our "status quo policy" abstracts from this aspect of reality, the causes of which
are myriad.

30

The optimal policy enables a substantially greater share of the children of lower-skilled parents to
move up the skill ladder than does the status quo policy. The optimal policy has much smaller–but
non-negative–e¤ects on the prospects of the children of higher-skilled parents. Intuitively, Tables 3
and 4 show that the optimal policy takes resources from higher-skilled parents and later generations
to support lower-skilled parents and earlier generations without worsening the prospects of children
of the higher-skilled. This moves resources from those for whom the e¤ect of resources on a child’s
ability is lower to those for whom they are higher (that is, from smaller to greater values of

i ).
c

As these transition matrices imply, the evolution of the ability distribution is di¤erent under the
optimal and the status quo policies. Figure 2 shows the ability distribution in the …fth generation
under the two policies, which closely resembles the distribution in all generations after the initial
one. This …gure shows the substantial shift toward a higher ability distribution under the optimal
policy that results from the greater progressivity of the optimal policy; the optimal policy leads to
1.8 percent fewer individuals of the lowest type and 1.6 percent more of the highest type.

Figure 2: Ability distribution under calibrated status quo
policy and social-welfare maximizing policy.

Welfare is much higher under the optimal policy, and it is more equitably distributed. In fact,
the welfare gain of moving from the status quo policy to the optimal policy is enormous: it is

31

equivalent to a 21 percent permanent increase in disposable income. But this very large gain is
predominately driven by something other than the e¤ect of policy on the ability distribution. In
particular, the optimal policy’s Utilitarian foundation places a high value on income equality, so
the greater redistribution to low-skilled parents under the optimal policy than under the status quo
policy generates most of this large estimated increase in welfare. Because we may be interested in
the importance of the endogenous ability channel alone in generating welfare gains, we consider the
following thought experiment.
Suppose that the status quo model were granted the distribution of abilities generated by the
optimal model for all generations; we call this the "adjusted status quo." Suppose further that
we hold …xed the within-period utility levels of all individuals in the status quo model, but we
calculate the total welfare for the economy given the adjusted status quo ability distributions.
This will generate a greater level of welfare. Now, returning to the status quo tax policy’s ability
distributions, we calculate the factor by which disposable income would have to rise in the status
quo model to reach the welfare of the adjusted status quo. This factor is a measure of the welfare
gain due solely to the optimal policy’s e¤ects on the ability distribution over time. Similar factors
can be calculated for each type of …rst-generation parent, as well, indicating how the welfare gains
through this channel are shared. Table 6 shows the results for the baseline case of ten generations.

As these results show, the optimal policy has the potential to generate a welfare gain equivalent
to one and three-quarters percent of aggregate disposable income simply by shifting the ability
distribution over time. The gains are somewhat larger among low-skilled parents, as would be
expected. Nevertheless, high-skilled parents gain substantially, as the e¢ ciency gains and greater
32

equality accruing to future generations raise the current generation’s present-value welfare. Gains
for future generations follow the same patterns.
In the Appendix, we explore the robustness of these baseline results to variation in time discounting

, the number of generations T , the assumed persistence of type across generations ,

and the number of types I. The qualitative and quantitative lessons of the baseline analysis prove
to be robust. In particular, optimal policy that takes advantage of endogenous ability is more
redistributive than the status quo, shifts resources from future to earlier generations, generates an
upward shift in the ability distribution, and yields a sizeable welfare gain.

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore the possibility that equalizing individuals’economic outcomes may help
to equalize their children’s opportunities: that is, when poor parents have more disposable income,
their children’s performance improves and they have greater opportunity to succeed. We study the
e¤ect that this intergenerational connection has on optimal tax policy, which will take advantage of
this relationship to shape the ability distribution over time. But exactly how it will do so depends
on complex interactions between natural ability and the returns to investment in human capital.
Ours is the …rst paper we know of to model this complexity and derive policy implications.
We characterize conditions describing optimal tax policy when children’s abilities depend on
both inherited characteristics and parental (…nancial) resources. On the intratemporal margin, we
highlight competing e¤ects of this endogeneity. If parental resources have greater marginal e¤ects
on the children of low-skilled parents, then optimal distortions may be smaller at low incomes
because of their positive e¤ects on overall tax revenues and the incentives of high-skilled parents.
On the other hand, larger distortions at low incomes have a bene…t in encouraging preceding
generations to invest in their children’s ability pushes in the other direction. In the end, the
implications for optimal marginal distortions are ambiguous. On the intertemporal margin, we
show that optimality requires a more sophisticated understanding of the cost of raising social
welfare through transfers across generations, in particular including the e¤ects of one generation’s
resources on future generations’tax payments and utilities.
We calibrate our model to microeconometric evidence on the transmission of skills and new
estimates of the e¤ects of increases in disposable income on a child’s ability, which we obtain by
analyzing panel data from the NLSY in the United States. We then simulate optimal policy in

33

this calibrated model and compare it to an estimated version of the existing U.S. tax code. The
schedules of optimal average and marginal tax rates are very di¤erent from those in existing policy,
as the optimal policy is substantially more redistributive and shifts the ability distribution up over
time. This shift in the ability distribution generates a welfare gain equivalent to 1.75 percent of
total disposable income in perpetuity, with larger gains for the poor. Even higher-skilled members
of the current generation gain substantially, however, as the gains in e¢ ciency and equality in
future generations raise the current generation’s present-value welfare.
Of course, future research may be able to improve our understanding of the tax policy studied
in this paper. For example, when a panel dataset of su¢ cient duration allows us to link data on
parents’ and children’s wages, this will allow estimates of the intergenerational e¤ect of parental
income on parent-child wage transitions. Incorporating other dimensions of parental in‡uence is
another natural next step. We have shown (in the Appendix) that parental leisure versus work time
does not seem to exert an important in‡uence in this case, but one might study how the composition
of parents’available resources (i.e., as disposable income or in-kind, such as education) a¤ects the
results. Such analyses may have implications for a broader class of policies that, like the taxes
in this paper, could be used to a¤ect–rather than merely respond to–the dynamics of the ability
distribution.
