compensated with an income transfer, which can be thought of as a portion of

tariff revenues or quota rents. In this setting the two countries should
negotiate over the level of tariff and transfer of rents, depending on the
level of political pressure at home. However, if this pressure cannot be

Introduction

Recent literature in international trade has emphasized that trade

barriers often result from political objectives. These include the desire of
politicians to satisfy a majority of voters (Mayer, 1984). or respond to
special interest lobbying groups.' The empirical basis for these models is

well established (see Baldwin, 1986). It is surprising, however, that this
literature has focused on a small country setting trade barriers without

any foreign repercussions. Thus, while the interests of domestic groups are
of critical importance, those of foreigners have only recently been considered.
For example, Das (1986), Husted (1986) and Hillman and Ursprung (1987) examine
how foreign lobbying affects domestic trade policy.
In this paper we shall consider a home government with political pressure

to restrict trade, at the expense of foreigners. The foreign country is
compensated with an income transfer, which can be thought of as a portion of

the tariff revenues or quota rents. In this setting the two countries should
negotiate over the level of tariff and transfer of rents, depending on the

level of political pressure at home. However, if this pressure cannot be
directly observed abroad, then the home country may have an incentive to claim

arbitarily high political need and seek corresponding high trade barriers. We
shall resolve this problem by determining incentive compatible trade policies,
in which the home government has no incentive to overstate (or understate) the
political pressure for protection.2

While our analysis is theoretical, it has direct policy implications.
Studies in the U.S. have recently called for the auctioning of trade quotas

with the proceeds going to the U.S. Treasury, or used to buy off domestic

groups lobbying for protection.3 Our analysis suggests that the receipt of

2.

these revenues could increase the lobbying for or level of protection, as
domestic groups or the government exaggerate

the political cost of Imports.

In order to maintain incentive compatibility (no overstatement of political
costs), it is necessary to leave a portion of the tariff revenues or quota
rents with foreigners.
In section 2 we outline a simple political model of protection. We adopt

Mayer's (1984) median voter model, in which the government seeks to restrict
imports and shift income towards

labor. In section 3 we introduce the foreign

country and discuss the incentives of some conventional trade policies. If
the home country receives all the tariff revenue, it will generally have an
incentive to overstate the political pressure.

incentive compatible trade policies. These can

In section 4 we solve for the
take the form of "tariff—rate

quotas," or "tariff-quotas," in which the tariff is applied to imports

exceeding some limit. Varying this limit permits the revenue/rents to be
allocated across countries, and therefore affects the incentives for

protection at home. In section 5 we briefly consider the case where political
pressure exists in both countries, and section 6 concludes. More technical
proofs are gathered in the Appendix.

2.

Median Voter Model

We consider a two good, two factor economy
scale, where the import competing good

with constant returns to

is labor intensive. Let p denote the

domestic price of this good, with the export good
prices are w =

as numeraire. Then factor

and p' < 0 due to our factor
w(p) and r = p(p), where w' > 0

intensity assumption. Protecting the import good will raise p and shift
income towards labor.

3.

As in Mayer (1984), we shall Suppose that consumers are endowed with both

labor and capital. Individuals have equal amounts of labor and we normalize
the total population to unity. Let a denote the capital/labor endowment of
individuals, which is distributed with mean of
that a0 <

z,

and median a0. We assume

which applies when the distribution of capital is skewed to the

right,4 In this model consumers differ only in their factor income. Under
majority voting, the government will respond to the interests of the consumer
with capital endowment

c — the median voter. In this section we shall
derive

a reduced form expression for the utility of the median voter, which will

serve as the government's objective function. While the median voter model of
government policy choice is not universally descriptive, it does provide us

with a simple and concrete basis for generating political costs associated
with imports (see Mayer (1984) and some of the references cited therein for a
discussion of the limitations of the median vote model). Of course there are
other explanations for the presence of political costs of importing, which the
reader is free to adopt in considering our model.
Denoting consumption of the importable by ci and of the exportable as c2,
let the utility of an individual be (c1) +

c2, with ' > 0,

•"

< 0.

The

additively seperable form simplifies our analysis, and means that all
individuals choose the same ci, regardless of their type, assuming they have

sufficient income. Recalling that the population is normalized at unity, in
the aggregate we will have c1 =
supply (yj

yl(p)

+ z where yi(p) is domestic supply

0) and z are imports. The equilibrium domestic price can be

determined from the consumers' first—order condition:

Income consists of factor

(per unit of labor) plus redistributed tariff revenue.

Denoting exports by x, the terms of
[p—(x/z)]z = pz —

trade are (x/z) so tariff revenue is

which is also the trade balance evaluated at domestic

prices. We assume the revenue is distributed as a poll subsidy, equally
across individuals. Thus, individual consumption of good 2 is:

The third equality in (2) follows since

the value of factor income (w+r)

equals output (py+y) in our competitive,

constant returns economy. In the

last equality note that y-x equals the aggregate (and average) consumption of

good 2. Then C2 for an individual will be greater (less) than the average
when that person's capital/labor endowment

is greater (less) than the mean.

We can now collect our results and derive an expression for utility.

5.

The last result occurs because an Increase in imports lowers the domestic

price p and thus raises the return to capital. Using (3), we can write
utility •(c1) +

c as follows:

Proposition 1. The utility of an individual with capital/labor endowment
U(z,x,a) =

u(z)

is

(-cx)r(z).

(4)

To interpret this result, note that the consumer with average capital

endowment of

receives utility u(z) -

x.

The median voter will receive lower

utility by the amount (-)r(z), where this reduction is an increasing
function of imports z. Thus, imports impose a component of welfare loss on
the median voter, by lowering p and shifting income from labor to capital.
The government will have an incentive to shift income in the opposite
direction using trade restrictions or other instruments.6
Before examining trade policy, we note a special case of Proposition 1.
If the production functions in the economy are Leontief (fixed coefficients on
labor and capital) and ,(ci) is quadratic, the u(z) will be quadratic and r(z)

linear in (4). We shall refer to this as the quadratic case, and use it

occasionally. This case guarantees that

0. A treatment

of political pressure abroad is deferred to section 5. In a slight change of
notation, let a denote the capital/labor endowment of the median voter at

home. The identity of this voter will depend on population dynamics and other
socio-econOmiC patterns, which we summarize by giving a a probability density
f(a) with strictly positive support over [a,a].7 This density is common
knowledge but only the home government observes the realization of a.
We shall assume that the foreign and domestic country are initially
governed by a trade agreement which specifies the level of imports z0 and

exports x0 to be exchanged. While we treat <z°, x0> as arbitrarily specified,
in practice they would be determined by economic and political conditions as
well as the relative bargaining positions of the two

countries. Given this

original agreement, the home country may wish to change the level and terms of
trade occasionally to account for the political costs of importation at home.
For example if a turns out to be low, so the redistributive costs of imports
are high, the domestic government may want to apply for a reduction in imports
to ease the political pressure it faces.
Towards this end, we assume that the two countries negotiate a schedule
of trades <z(ct), x(a)> which are applied contingent on the value of a

announced by the home country. For this negotiated agreement to be feasible
we require that it be incentive compatible (IC), meaning that the menu of
trades <z(a), x(a)> must be designed so that the home country truthfully

reports a.8 To formalize this idea let U(a'/a) denote the utility of the home
country when it announces a' and a is the actual value. tJ(a'/a) is defined by

(IC) restricts the set of trade policies which can be implemented. For
example, consider a policy designed to maximize the sum of domestic and
foreign country welfare, inclusive of the political costs of importing as

perceived by the home country. Denote this sum by

W(Z,a)

shall refer to z as the "politically optimal" level of trade. It provides

for efficient trade subject to political constraints at home. Note that z' =

or overstate the value of a. This

is because all consumers would

experience a decline in utility due to the higher import price, but the factor

income for the median voter would also rise, and the relative magnitude of
these effects is ambiguous.9
To conclude this section we characterize the set of trade policies which
are incentive compatible. Assuming that z(ct) and x(a) are differentiable, a
local characterization of (IC) requires that

assumptions, the local (IC) conditions are sufficient to insure (IC) holds

globally as well. These results are formally summarized in:

Determination of Trade Restrictiqfl

One requirement for z(a), x(cz) to

be feasible is that it satisfy (IC).

Another requirement is that z(a), x(a),
that both countries must weakly prefer

be individually rational (IR), meaning

the trade vector <z(cz), x(a)> to the

status quo vector <z0, x0>. This guarantees

x0> in an expected value sense.

11.

The determination of <z(a), x(a)> would presumably involve bilateral
negotiations between the home and foreign country. One can imagine a myriad
of different processes and arrangements by which such trade agreements would

be Constituted. For our purposes it is convenient to assume that negotiations
are handled by a third party (perhaps by an institution like GATT) who
evaluates the claims of the home and

foreign country in constructing a trade

agreement. In particular we imagine that the agreement <z(a), x(Q)> is
determined by maximizing the weighted sum of expected home country and foreign
country welfare subject to (IC) and (IR) constraints.

Formally <z(a), x(a)>

compatible. Note that by construction the median voter at home gains from
this trade restriction. The magnitude of gain is measured as area ABG in
Figure 1, which is the difference between marginal utility and marginal cost
of imports, integrated over the reduction in z.
Proposition 3 demonstrates the existence of incentive compatible

agreements that provide for politically optimal trade. While such agreements
are feasible (they satisfy IR and IC) they require that all of the extra rents
generated by the agreement are captured by the home country, as indicated by

parts (b) and (c) of Proposition 3•11 Such an uneven distribution of rents is
unlikely to result from a bargaining process. Thus while the case x

1

serves as a useful benchmark for our analysis, the more likely scenario is

that x < 1. This allows for some of the differential rents generated by the
negotiated agreement to accrue to the foreign country.

4.2 Solution for x

<

1

To solve (TP) for the case where

< 1, it turns out to be convenient to

rewrite the problem taking explicit account of the constraints. (IR) requires
that U(z(a), x(a),cz)

U(z°,x°,cz) for all realizations of a. The graph of

U(x0,z0,cx) appears in Figure 2. The slope of U(x°,z°,a) with respect to a is

r(z°). Recall that (IC) requires that —

U(z(a),x(a)a)

=

r(z(a))

and that

z(a) be nondecreasing. Since r'(z) > 0, this means that the slope of
U(z(ct),x(ct),a) is nondecreasing as well. Cases where U(z(u),x(a),a) =

U(z°,x°,a)

over two distinct intervals are not possible, since then

—. U(z(cz),x(a)a) is not increasing everywhere.12 Hence U(Z(cz),x(ct),a) and

14.

U(z0,x0,cz) can only coincide over a single interval as depicted in Figure 2.

Further since x

< 1,

(IR) for the home country will always bind over some

interval.

Let us denote the interval over which (IR) binds as [czl,a2], where a

4.3 Interpretation of Negotiated Trade Policy

Parts (a) —(c) of Proposition 4 are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.
Figure 2 illustrates that (IR) binds along an interior interval of the support

for a. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the negotiated import level
z(a), the status quo level z0, and the politically optimal level of imports

Recall that when x

trade is politically optimal with

The problem with this is that the home country earns

all of the rents from the negotiation. By allowing x < 1 we distribute some
of the rents from negotiation to the foreign country as indicated by part c of

Proposition 4. However, when x < 1, the negotiated trade vector is no longer
politically optimal. According to Proposition 4 and Figure 3, the level of
imports is too large for small realization of a and it is too small for large

realizations of a. This deviation from politically optimal trade is explained
as follows.

Let's suppose for the sake of illustration that one attempts to implement

z*(a)

a policy with z(a) =

for all a, and that all of the gains accrue to the

foreign country subject to satisfying (IR) at home.15 In this case
x(a) =

W(z*(a),a))

—

LJ(z0,x0,cz) + v(z*(a)). Does this policy satisfy (IC)?

Given the trade vector <z*(a), x(a)> we have,

U(a'/a) =

u(z*(aI))

—

(_a)r(z*(ao))

—

v(z*(cz'))

—

W(Z*(cz'),a)

incentive to understate these costs when a < cL*.

When a < a* the way to prevent the home country from claiming that it's
political costs are low when they are really high (i.e., when a is small) is
to force the country to import more when it declares that its costs are low.
This discourages a high cost country from behaving like a low cost importer.
Similarly, when a > a*, the way to prevent the home country from claiming
large political costs when its costs are really low, is to restrict the level
of imports when the country claims high political costs. This makes it less

attractive for a low cost country to claim that it is a high cost importer.
The necessity to eliminate incentives for misrepresentation by the home
country explains the distortions of the import level z(cz) from the politically

optimal level. Note that at the end points a and ;, it is not necessary to
distort import levels and z(cz) =

z*(a).

This is because there are no lower a

types who would try to claim that they are an a type, and there are no higher
a types who would try to claim they are an

type.

An alternative way to characterize the negotiated trade policy is to
examine the tariff, T =

u'-v',

which is the difference between the domestic

and foreign price of the import, and the marginal political cost of importing

which is MC =

(;—a)r'(z).

political costs decline:

Under negotiated trade both T and MC fall as

19.

=

dMC

(u"—v")z'(a)

=

dcz

0,

—r'(z) + (—a)r"(z)z'(a)

0,

by part e of Proposition 4•16 Generally, however, the tariff will not equal
the marginal political cost of importing as would be required if the level of

imports were politically optimal. Part b of Proposition 4 implies that

W {} 0

as

a } a*.

Hence when a < u so that political costs are high, W < 0 implies that
T <

(a—a)r'(z)

=

MC or that the tariff is less than the marginal political

costs of importing. The tariff exceeds the marginal political cost of
importing when political costs are relatively low, such that a > ci*.
An interesting feature of the negotiated trade agreement <z(a), x(a)> is

the extent to which it coincides with the status quo agreement <z°, x0>. One
way to implement negotiated trade is to allow the home country to select an

import—export combination from the specified trade schedule <z(a), x(a)>. The
amount of autonomy afforded the home country is reflected in the degree to
which <z(cz), x(a)> differs from <zO, x0>. Note that the choice of zO is

politically optimal for some level of costs, a*. Figure 3 shows that for
values of a sufficiently close to cx*, negotiated trade simply calls for

implementing <zO, xO> since z0 is close to being politically optimal.
However, as indicated in Figure 3, greater decision making authority is

afforded the home country when realized political costs differ significantly

from a*. The home country is allowed to use its knowledge of political costs
to pick an import level which is more efficient than the status quo level z0.

20.

Part d of Proposition 4 indicates that the coincidence between
<z(a), x(ct)> and <TO, x0> diminishes as x increases.

When more weight is

placed on the welfare of the home country, It is afforded more decision making

authority. In Figure 3, higher x means that the interval (cq,cx2) shrinks, and

2(a) moves closers to z*(a). In the limit when x = 1, the borne
delegated complete authority to choose imports, and z(a) =

country

z*(ct).

is

However this

is done at the expense of the foreign country. Hence the autonomy of the home
country must be restricted if the foreign country is to obtain any gain from
the negotiated agreement.
To conclude this section we note that the preceeding discussion has
assumed that z*(cz) < z0 < z*(;). The negotiated trade policy does not change
significantly in the corner cases where either (I) z0

*(). In

case (i) one can show <2(a), x(a)> coincides with <z0, x0> over

some interval [al,c*2] where a =

z(a) =

z*(a) or (ii) z0

For ac(a,ai), z(a) > z*(a) and

z*(cz). It can be seen that these corner cases are just limiting cases

of the policy described in Proposition 4.

5.

Political Pressure in Both Countries
Suppose that the foreign government also has pressure to raise the income

of its median voter. With the labor-intensive good exported abroad, the
optimal foreign trade policy would involve expanding exports.

We shall

incorporate the foreign political pressure into our statement of (TP), and
investigate whether a negotiated trade restriction can satisfy (IC) for both
countries.

21.

Analogous to U(z,x,a) in Proposition 1, utility of the median voter
abroad can be stated as

V(z,x,8) =

x

—

v(z)

—

(B—8)s(z),

(19)

where [8,8] is the median capital/labor endowment abroad, and s(z) is the
foreign rental on capital depending on exports. An Increase in exports would
reduce the amount of the labor-intensive good available abroad, thereby
raising its price and lowering the rental, so s' <

0.

The countries will now

negotiate a schedule of trades <z(a,B), x(a,8)> contingent on a and B

announced by each of them. We shall consider a dominant strategy where, for
any value of B, the home government has an incentive to truthfully announce a,

and similarly for the foreign country. Let U(a,B) and V(a,B) denote welfares

with the announced and true values of (,B). Then analogous to Proposition 2,
(IC) at home requires:'7

LJa

= [u'-(a-a)r']

(21a)

(21b)

Consider maximizing the integral of world welfare W(z,a,B), defined as
the sum of (4) and (19), subject to (IC) and a statement of (IR) for both

countries. We are interested in the set of trade schedules z(a,B) which can
satisfy the (IC) constraints. Differentiating (20a) with respect to B we

22.

obtain an expression for

while differentiating (21a) with respect to

yields xa. Setting these equal and simplifying, we obtain the following
partial

differential equation for z(a,8):
WzzZZ8 + WzZ = 0.

(22)

The class of solutions to (22), where statements of (.IR) can be used to
provide boundary conditions, defines the set of trade schedules over which

world welfare can be maximized. We have not been able to obtain any

non—trivial solutions to (22).18 However, It is significant that we rule out
the politically optimal level of trade z*(,e), at which Wz(Z*,cz,) = 0 and
world welfare is maximized without the (IC) constraints.'9 To see this,
differentiate the latter condition to obtain z* =
=

s'/W

<

0,

r'/Wzz

>

0 and

where Wzz < 0 is assumed.2° Thus, with politically optimal

trade (22) reduces to r's'/Wzz =

0, which can never hold. We have therefore

established:

Proposition 5 Politically optimal trade z*(,) cannot satisfy (IC) for both
countries.

Proposition 5 can be understood as follows. With political pressure only
at home, the optimum Z*(a) was incentive compatible when the home country

received all the gains from restricting trade (Proposition 3). Foreign
welfare was constant at its status quo level. However, in the discussion
around (18) we argued that a constant level of welfare could not be incentive

compatible for that country. Thus, with political pressure In both countries,
(IC) requires some sharing of the gains from negotiated trade. Analogous to
Proposition 4, this implies a trade schedule which Is not at the first best
optimum.

23.

ConclusIons

The approach we have utilized to explain trade negotiation contrasts with
the repeated game view of such negotiations (e.g., McMillan, 1986). Here one
envisions that two or more countries who trade with each other repeatedly
reach an agreement, which is enforced by the threat of reversion to
protectionist policies should one of the countries violate the agreement.
Violations are only profitable for a country if It can "cheat" on the
agreement for some minimal period of time until its trading partner discovers

the violation. With this view, one interprets changes from the status quo
agreement as evidence of retaliation against countries who have been caught

violating the agreement. While such behavior is possible we think it is
unlikely that countries would believe that trade violations they would

contemplate would go unnoticed for very long. This is because trade policy is
a matter of public record, and is subject to scrutiny and review by various
special interest groups that have a stake in the outcome of the trading

process. In contrast to this, the model we have adopted assumes that
unilateral deviations by a country from the status quo agreement can be
observed, but that incentives for one country to deviate from the agreement

can't be verified or observed by its trading partners. This means that the
countries must bargain In an Incomplete Information environment.

Our results can be given two Interpretations. First, as a positive
theory, they suggest a reason for the use of "voluntary" trade restraints

rather than tariffs. A VER is generally requested by the Importing country,
but the quota rents are earned by the exporter. One reason for the transfer
of rents is that the exporter Is compensated for the trade restriction (as
discussed by

Deardorff,

1986), and so retaliation is not expected. However,

our analysis suggests another reason: the transfer of rents means that the

24.

trade restriction is incentive compatible, I.e., if the importing country did
not actually face strong political pressure, it would not find it beneficial

to have the restriction. Thus, the transfer of rents becomes a policing
device to ensure that political pressure is truthfully revealed.
However, it should be noted that an incentive compatible policy will not
generally involve a full transfer of the quota rents, as occurs under the VER.
For example, in Proposition 3 the transfer is just sufficient to return the

foreign country to its status quo utility. We characterized this policy as a
"tariff-quota," in which the tariff is applied only to imports exceeding some

limit. In Proposition 4 the foreign country obtains higher welfare, but the
transfer would equal the full revenue/rents only by coincidence.

The

interpretation of our model as an explanation for VER's is therefore limited.
Another interpretation of our results is as a normative theory,
suggesting a policy which could be applied to actual trade restrictions. The
simple results (Proposition 3) state that the foreign country should be
exactly compensated for any trade restriction, keeping its utility unchanged.
The amount of compensation required is easily calculated from the foreign
supply curve, as illustrated in Figure 1, and could be implemented with an

appropriate tariff-quota. To raise foreign welfare beyond its status quo
level requires a more complicated policy (Proposition 4). In this case the
initial

level of trade is preserved over a discrete interval of a (see Figure

3). For levels of political pressure outside this interval, trade is
restricted or increased,

but

does not coincide with the political optimum.

The private nature of political pressure at home is In this case imposing a
cost which lowers world welfare. This result also occurs with private
political pressure in both countries (Proposition 5), even if the countries
have equal weight in world welfare.

2. The idea of incentive compatible trade policies was introduced in Feenstra
(1987), who considered production uncertainty with two possible states.
The present paper is also related to Jensen and Thursby (1986), who
suppose that the foreign country does not know the home objective function

with certainty. They examine Nash equilibrium tariffs of Bayesian games.
Prusa (1987) examines an incentive compatibility approach to the transfer
pricing problem.

6. We restrict our attention to trade policies (choice of z and x), used to
raise income of the median voter. These should be considered as
second-best since, as shown by Mayer and Riezman (1987), they can be
dominated by a production subsidy and consumption tax with the tariff used

only to influence the terms of trade. Before examining domestic
instruments in this model, however, it is necessary to consider the

information structure. For example, production subsidies could
realistically be considered as private information to each country.

26.

Dislocation costs would be private Information to workers, which affects

the feasibility of factor market interventions. We feel that a ranking of
trade and domestic instruments should only be made with Information

asymetries of this type Incorporated.

7. We assume that

is not so low that the home government would want to

reverse the pattern of trade. This is ensured if a equals the capital

labor ratio which, if used in production, would yield autarky. Then the
optimal trade policy for the median voter will not restrict trade that
far.

8. The Relevation Principle assures us that there is no loss in generality
from considering incentive compatible policies (see Myerson, 1979).
9.

A presumption that (12) is negative, leading to an overstatement of
political pressure, is obtained by requiring that home welfare under the

VER is greater than with free trade. Free trade occurs when

yielding

utility U(cxIcL). Then U(czlci)

=

0

U(:/c) implies that U1(a/a)

for some aEa,;], and if this condition holds for a =

then (12) is

negative. For the quadratic case mentioned after Proposition 1, we can

show that U1(a/) is minimized at a =

, and

0

so we must have Ui(/a)

leading to an overstatement of political pressure.

10. With minimal loss of generality, we assume that z*(a)

Other cases are dealt with at the end of section 4.3.

11. This must be the allocation of rents given the restriction that z0

U(zO,xO,cz*) where

and U'(cx) =

dW(Z*(cz),cz)/da.

12. This is readily seen by redrawing Figure 2, with U(z(a),x(a),a)
coinciding with lJ(z0,x0,) on two seperate intervals.

13. If Z(a) Is decreasing in the solution to (TP') then the solution must be
modified to satisfy the constraint that z(a) be everywhere

nonedecreasing. Typically this means that there will be Intervals over
which z(a) is constant.

14. Note that Z(a) takes a discontinuous upward jump at

as depicted in

Figure 3. See the proof of Proposition 3 for details.
15. Ignoring the (IC) constraint, this policy would maximize (TP) when x < 1.

16. To sign the change in MC we also require r"

0. This would be

satisfied In the quadratic case mentioned after Proposition 1, for which

r"=O.
17. For concreteness, we shall assume that z and x are twice continuously
differentiable functions of (a,8).

18. It is not difficult to construct solutions for which

2a

or

zA are

identically zero, while also satisfying (IR) for both countries.

19. This result is not surprising. It is well known that dominant strategy
pareto efficient mechanisms typically don't exist in general economic
environments (e.g., Groves and Ledyard, 1985).

20. This concavity condition is guaranteed if the quadratic case discussed
after Proposition 1 is applied to both countries.
