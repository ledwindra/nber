    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the international spillover effects of air pollution by developing a framework that integrates recent advances in atmospheric science into econometric estimation with microdata on mortality and health. Combining transboundary particle trajectory data with the universe of individual-level mortality and emergency room visit data in South Korea, we find that transboundary air pollution from China significantly increases mortality and morbidity in South Korea. Using these estimates, we show that a recent Chinese environmental policy \u201cwar on pollution\u201d generated a substantial international spillover benefit. Finally, we examine China\u2019s strategic pollution reductions and provide their implications for the potential Coasian bargaining.\n\n",
