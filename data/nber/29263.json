    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper provides causal evidence on the impact of a large-scale industrial policy \u2013 South Korea\u2019s Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive \u2013 on firms\u2019 long-term performance and quantifies its long-term welfare effects. Using unique historical data on the universe of firm-level subsidies and a natural experiment, we find large and persistent effects of this industrial policy. Subsidized firms grew faster than those never subsidized for 30 years after subsidies ended. We build a quantitative heterogeneous firm model that rationalizes these effects through a combination of learning-by-doing and financial frictions. The model is calibrated to firm-level data, and its key parameters are disciplined with the econometric estimates. The HCI Drive generated larger benefits than costs. If it had not been implemented, South Korea\u2019s welfare would have been 3-4% lower. The majority of the total welfare impact comes from the long-term productivity benefits of learning-by-doing.\n\n",
