JEL No. I10, F21
ABSTRACT
We conduct a panel data analysis of 74 countries over 1980 n2000 to investigate whether population
health affects foreign direct investment inflows. Our main finding is that health has a positive and
significant effect on such inflows for low- and middle-income countries. This finding is consistent
with the view that health is an integral component of human capital in developing countries.

1. INTRODUCTION

As Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote in the 19th century, "Health is the first
wealth". Sickness and disability constrain human capability and have a negative impact on
welfare (Bloom, Canning, and Jamison, 2004). In addition to the importance of health as a
consumption good, health can also be viewed as a form of human capital that enhances economic
performance both for the individual and at the level of the macroeconomy.
Health affects economic performance through direct and indirect mechanisms (Bloom
and Canning, 2000). It has a direct effect on workers’ productivity because healthy workers are
generally more physically and mentally robust than those afflicted with disease or disability and
are less likely to be absent from work because of personal or household illness. Microeconomic
analyses using anthropometric measures (such as onset of menarche, stature, and nutritional
status) as well as indexes of morbidity, have consistently demonstrated that health affects
earnings and productivity (Knaul, 1999; Ribero, 1999; Savedoff and Schultz, 2000; Schultz and
Tansel, 1997).
Health can also affect economic performance through indirect mechanisms; for example,
improved health can increase the return to other forms of human capital, such as education and
worker experience. Healthier children have enhanced cognitive function and higher school
attendance, allowing them to become better educated, higher earning adults (Bhargava, 2001). In
addition, healthier workers, who have lower rates of absenteeism and longer life expectancies,
acquire more job experience.
At the macroeconomic level, a substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that
population health is a robust predictor of growth in per capita income (Barro, 1991; Bhargava et

al., 2001; Bloom, Canning, & Sevilla, 2004). However, countries may benefit to different
degrees from health; Bhargava et al. (2001) argue that economic growth resulting from health
improvements is more pronounced in developing countries than in industrial countries.
Health, viewed as a form of human capital, could affect foreign direct investment (FDI)
through

several

mechanisms.1

The

World

Health

Organization’s

Commission

on

Macroeconomics and Health (2001) suggests that a healthy workforce is important when
attracting foreign direct investment due to the effect of health on worker productivity. In
addition, for fear of endangering their own health and that of their expatriate staff, foreign
investors may shun areas where disease is rampant and where access to health care is limited.2
A classic instance of disease interfering with investment was during the building of the
Panama Canal. Yellow fever and other pathogens claimed the lives of 10,000 to 20,000 workers
between 1882 and 1888, forcing Ferdinand de Lesseps and the French to abandon the
construction project (Jones, 1990). More recently, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) has exemplified how disease, or even the fear of disease, can dampen
investment: FDI inflows into mainland China declined by US$2.7 billion during 2003 (Business
Daily Update, 2003). Similarly, FDI inflows to Hong Kong fell 62% in one quarter (Tam, 2003).
These trends quickly reversed once the outbreak was controlled, but they suggest that lengthier
epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS or malaria, could have severe, long-term effects on FDI.3
Even though circumstantial evidence suggests a link between health and FDI, empirical
findings are noticeably absent. The gap in the literature is not without consequence. While other
sources of capital market flows and official development assistance to developing countries have
steadily declined, FDI has continued to rise and now represents the largest component of net
resource flows to developing countries (Miyamoto, 2003). In addition to providing employment

2

opportunities and financial capital, FDI can generate positive externalities, such as transferring
technology and skills and increasing access to global markets (Lim, 2001; UNCTAD, 2003).
These potential benefits are particularly relevant for developing countries and many are
actively seeking to attract greater FDI inflows. Many countries have already implemented
business facilitation measures, created investment promotion agencies, and liberalized their
investment frameworks (Asiedu and Lien, 2004; UNCTAD, 1998). One consequence of the
convergence of national FDI policies is that it has become more difficult for a country to
distinguish itself based on economic policy alone (UNCTAD, 1998). In this paper we investigate
the role of population health as a possible factor that encourages inflows of FDI.4
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the theory of FDI
and the empirical model used in the analysis, Section 3 details the data used and our sources,
Section 4 presents our empirical results, and Section 5 concludes. To the best of our knowledge,
this represents the first empirical investigation evaluating whether health directly affects, ceteris
paribus, FDI.5

2. THE MODEL
Firms invest abroad instead of, say, exporting or licensing to a local company, to satisfy
one of two strategic objectives. They may seek to better serve the local market, producing locally
to avoid transportation costs, trade barriers, or production delays, and speed information flow;
this is market-seeking or horizontal FDI. Alternatively, they may seek to produce for the global
market but select this location to minimize production costs through lower-cost inputs; this is
export-oriented or vertical FDI (Shatz and Venables, 2000).

3

Following Asiedu (2002) and Blonigen and Wang (2004), we conjecture that horizontal
FDI will be driven largely by domestic demand (market size). Local production allows a firm to
avoid transportation costs and import duties, but this is only attractive if the domestic market is
sufficiently large to cover the fixed costs of setting up production and any country-specific cost
disadvantages. Investigators have traditionally found that host market size, usually measured in
terms of real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and population size, is a positive
determinant of FDI inflows (Chakrabarti, 2001; Schneider and Frey, 1985; Wheeler and Mody,
1992). By contrast, ceteris paribus, vertical FDI will flow to countries that possess cheap,
productive inputs and have the fewest restrictions on trade. The presence of highly educated
healthy workers, available at low wages, may be a large inducement for vertical FDI.
We model the gross level of FDI inflows at time t in country i as follows:

log FDIit = a + α log Pop it + β log GDP per cap it + θ Health it + µ log Edu it + γ Xit + Dt + εit,

where Pop is total population and X represents a set of control variables. We include time
dummies, Dt, to capture changes in the volume of global international investment flows, and ε
represents the error term.
Our FDI measure is gross inflows. Many researchers use other measures, for example, net
inflows, but we prefer gross inflows for two reasons. First, this measure seems more appropriate
for investigating the incentives for foreign businesses to invest in a particular country. Second, in
terms of knowledge spillovers, which may be a central benefit of FDI, it is the gross inflows that
matter and not net inflows.

4

Population and GDP per capita can be considered as scale variables that capture market
size effects. However, GDP per capita can also be thought of as a proxy for labor costs
(assuming a fairly fixed share of labor income in total GDP). The coefficient on GDP per capita
should therefore be interpreted with caution, because it may reflect both a market size and a cost
effect. The literature commonly normalizes FDI flows by dividing by some scale variable, for
example, population or GDP. We prefer not to impose a particular normalization or scale factor,
instead estimating a relationship. Our log formulation allows for normalization by population or
GDP as special cases. For example, in the case of population we can transform our equation as
follows:

log (FDI/Pop)it = a + (α-1) log Pop it + β log GDP per cap it + θ Health it + µ log Edu it + γ Xit + Dt + εit.

It follows that we can test if normalizing by population is a valid method of measuring the scale
effect by estimating the original equation and testing the restriction that α = 1. A coefficient on
population different from unity suggests that a simple normalization achieved by dividing FDI
by population does not fully capture the scale effect of population size. Similarly, normalizing
FDI by total GDP gives an equation with a coefficient of α – 1 on log population and β − 1 on
log GDP per capita, without changing any of the other coefficients.
At a given level of labor costs, proxied in our model by GDP per capita, our theory
suggests that countries with higher levels of education and health should have more productive
workers and should be more attractive to foreign investors. We use life expectancy at birth to
proxy the health of a country’s population. We would prefer a measure of health that explicitly
accounts not only for mortality rates, but also for the morbidity effects of ill-health. However,
Murray and Lopez (1996) demonstrate that higher life expectancy is associated with lower

5

morbidity and overall better health status. Furthermore, Shastry and Weil (2002) report that the
survival rate of adult males is linearly related to adult male height, which is often used as a
measure of health (human) capital. These findings establish a relationship between mortality and
morbidity measurements.
Following Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), who argue that secondary schooling is the
best measure of education for predicting economic growth, our educational stock measure is the
log of the percentage of the population aged 25 or above who have completed secondary
schooling (Cohen and Soto, 2001).
We follow the literature for the inclusion of other relevant control variables, including
openness of the economy, infrastructure, quality of governance, and distance to major world
markets. Openness of the economy to trade is especially important for firms seeking to export
products from the host country to the global market, as tariffs, quotas, and other forms of capital
controls will diminish firms’ profits (Asiedu and Lien, 2004). Openness is required not only with
respect to exports, but also for imports, because many FDI ventures may require the purchase of
intermediate inputs from abroad. We employ the ratio of trade (imports + exports) to GDP as our
measure of openness.
Governance is increasingly being identified as a key factor that firms evaluate when
choosing to invest abroad (Gastanaga, Nugent and Pashamova, 1998; MIGA and Deloitte &
Touche, 2002). In particular, the quality of bureaucratic institutions affects FDI inflows
(Globerman and Shapiro, 2002; Stein and Daude, 2001). Wei (2000) finds that corruption has a
strong negative impact on the location of FDI. We use Knack and Keefer (1995) indexes of
bureaucratic quality and corruption in government.

6

Good infrastructure in the form of transportation and communication networks can
increase firm productivity and help attract foreign investment. We employ telephone mainlines
per 1,000 population as a proxy for host country infrastructure. However, this measure has its
shortcomings, as it only accounts for the availability and not the reliability of the infrastructure,
which may be particularly problematic in poor countries where support for infrastructure may be
lacking (Asiedu, 2002).
We also investigate whether geography affects the distribution of FDI inflows.
Transportation costs and distance from the home country are commonly included in gravity
models of international investment and may affect a firm’s decision about where to locate abroad
(Brainard, 1997; Yigang, 2003). Although Hausmann and Fernández-Arias (2000) find that

distance to major markets is not a robust FDI determinant, we include distance from major
markets as a possible control variable in our analysis.
In addition, Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1999) argue that the economies of coastal
regions, with their easy access to international trade through sea lanes, should outperform the
economies of inland areas. While inland areas can access markets through rail or road links,
these are often much more expensive forms of transportation. Thus we include a dummy variable
for whether a country is landlocked with the stipulation that the country is not located in Western
or Central Europe (countries in Western and Central Europe have close proximity to a major
market and the absence of sea routes may not matter).
3. DATA
The empirical analysis employs panel data for a set of 74 countries observed over the last
two decades. A list of countries used in the analysis is provided in Table 1. A summary of data
sources and variable descriptions is provided in Table 2. We use all countries for which data are

7

available, but exclude major petroleum exporters, because for these countries our measure of
openness (trade flows) may not reflect a lack of trade barriers, and GDP per capita is unlikely to
proxy labor costs.6

[insert tables 1 and 2 about here]

The dependent variable, gross FDI inflows, is based on annual data averaged over each
decade. We constructed gross FDI inflows using data from the World Development Indicators
(World Bank, 2003). The World Development Indicators does not include data on gross inflows
directly, but does provide data on total gross flows (the sum of gross inflows and gross outflows)
and on net inflows (gross inflows minus gross outflows), from which gross inflows can be
derived.7
All explanatory variables are taken at the beginning of the relevant time period.8
Summary statistics for the full sample are presented in Table 3. The correlation coefficients for
the full sample of 74 countries are presented in Table 4. Life expectancy ranks second only to
GDP per capita in strength of raw correlation to log gross FDI inflows.

4. ESTIMATION AND RESULTS
Table 5 reports our panel data estimates for the full sample of 74 countries with up to two
observations per country, one for 1980–90 and one for 1990–2000. All reported regressions

8

passed the Ramsey RESET test for model misspecification. In addition, we estimate
heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.

[insert table 5 about here]

Column (1) of Table 5 reports results for an ordinary least squares specification that is
representative of the FDI literature. The coefficients on income per capita and total population,
our indicators of market size, are positive and strongly significant, and this remains true for all
our specifications. Corruption is not significantly different from zero in our specifications, yet
the other governance measure, quality of bureaucratic institutions, is both significant and positive
in the model. Adding life expectancy in column (2) demonstrates that health is a statistically
significant predictor of gross FDI inflows at the 1% level and is robust to adding education in
column (3). The results indicate that every additional year of life expectancy increases FDI
inflows by about 7% among the full sample of countries.
The other component of human capital, education, has a positive coefficient, but is not
statistically significant.

This finding is consistent with the conflicting evidence on the

importance of education in determining inflows of FDI. Root and Ahmed (1979), as well as
Schneider and Frey (1985), report that education does not significantly affect FDI flows to
developing countries. More recently, however, Noorbakhsh and Paloni (2001) and Globerman
and Shapiro (2002) argue that education does have a positive and significant impact on foreign
investment and that its effect has been increasing over time. The reason for the poorly
determined coefficient on secondary schooling in our model could be due to measurement error
in the data on education that biases the estimated coefficient toward zero (see Krueger and

9

Lindahl, 2001). We also tried other measures of education, such as the number of accumulated
years of education in the population aged 15–64 and school enrollment rates, but did not find any
measure that produced a statistically significant effect.
We further test for robustness by adding infrastructure and geographic variables that are
also postulated to be determinants of FDI inflows: including telephones as a proxy for
infrastructure, a dummy variable for landlocked status and distance to major markets. The results
reported in column (4) indicate that the coefficient on life expectancy is robust to these alternate
specifications, though many of the controls do not themselves appear to be statistically
significant.
Recent evidence suggests that pooling data from industrial and developing countries in
empirical FDI studies may yield misleading coefficient estimates (Blonigen and Wang, 2004).
We might expect that developing countries are more dependent on export-oriented, vertical FDI,
while industrial countries are more attractive for market-seeking, horizontal FDI. Of particular
relevance to the current study, we noted a gap in average life expectancy between income
groups: 75.2 years for high-income countries versus 59.4 years for low- and middle-income
countries. Diminishing returns to health might well make it a more important investment in lowincome countries. We therefore analyze the model using two restricted samples, one of low- and
middle-income countries and one of high-income countries selected on the basis of the World
Bank’s income classification.9,10
The results for low- and middle-income countries are reported in Table 6. The model
being estimated in Table 6 is identical to that reported in Table 5, the only difference being the
sample. The results are broadly similar to those in Table 5. The coefficient on openness is
somewhat larger than before, which is consistent with foreign investment to developing countries

10

being mainly export-oriented. Life expectancy once again has a positive and statistically
significant effect on FDI. The large decrease in the coefficient on GDP per capita when we add
life expectancy to the model indicates that when health is excluded from the model, GDP per
capita is, to some extent, serving as a proxy for health in low- and middle-income countries.
The effect of population health on FDI inflows is robust to adding education and other
control variables. Our results suggest that every additional year of life expectancy leads to about
a 9% increase in gross FDI flows to low- and middle-income countries.

[insert table 6 about here]

The index of corruption is now significant, but of the wrong sign. The results suggest that
higher levels of corruption are associated with higher levels of FDI in low- and middle-income
countries. This finding, although perhaps surprising, agrees with Stein and Daude’s (2001) and
Wheeler and Mody’s (1992) results. It is also consistent with Alesina and Weder (1999), who
argue that the relationship between corruption and economic performance is complicated. Some
types of corruption may allow the relatively efficient provision of services to foreign firms, its
main effect being on the distribution of domestic economic gains with little distortion of
productive activities.
Table 7 uses the same specifications as Table 5 for a restricted sample of high-income
countries. The sample size now becomes quite small and may lead to some variables becoming
statistically insignificant simply because of a lack of power; therefore, these results should be
treated with caution. Unlike the results reported from the previous two samples, openness, GDP
per capita and bureaucratic quality are not statistically significant. The lack of significance of

11

openness is consistent with the theory that FDI going to industrial countries is mainly to access
their markets rather than to export.

[insert table 7 about here]

Even though GDP per capita does not have a significant impact on FDI inflows, the other
proxy of market size, total population, is highly significant at the 1 percent level. The lack of
significance of GDP per capita could be due to a balancing of the market size effects with the
cost of production effect, which tends to work in the opposite direction.
Reduced corruption does appear to have a positive and significant impact on FDI in this
sample, indicating that the type of corruption, or the way it affects the economy, may differ
between industrial and developing countries.
Most important from our point of view, health is not statistically significant in any
specification among high-income countries. This is consistent with the view that the worker
productivity effects of health differentials appear mainly in developing countries, although our
caveat about the small sample size for the high-income countries should be noted here.

5. CONCLUSION

This paper provides empirical evidence that health is indeed a positive and statistically
significant determinant of FDI inflows to low- and middle-income countries. These results are
robust to adding control variables, such as education, infrastructure, and income per capita. By
contrast, improved health does not appear to contribute significantly to the attractiveness of high-

12

income countries to foreign investors. Our findings support the results of Bhargava et al., (2001),
who find diminishing returns to health as a factor in economic growth. Our results are also
consistent with those of Blonigen and Wang (2004), who argue that the underlying factors that
determine the level of FDI activity vary systematically across countries at different stages of
development.
Our main result is that a one-year improvement in life expectancy contributes to about a
9% increase in gross FDI inflows to low- and middle-income countries. Our findings are
consistent with the literature that links health to increased worker productivity and suggest that
the payoff to population health improvements should also include an elevated rate of FDI
inflows.

NOTES
1

Lucas (1990) conjectures that differences in human capital could account for the failure of international capital
flows to equalize capital-labor ratios across countries.
2
In addition to normal risks, foreign investors and their managerial staff may lack resistance to disease, either
acquired or inherited, that the host country population enjoys. For example, a significant portion of the population in
Africa carries the sickle cell trait. This condition confers protection from severe malaria and is much less common
among European descendants (Pasvol, Weatherall, and Wilson, 1978).
3
Indeed, preliminary evidence supports this hypothesis. A global business survey on HIV/AIDS sponsored by the
World Economic Forum (Bloom et al., 2003) suggests that half of all business leaders in low-income countries
believe HIV affects their country’s access to FDI. Similarly, Gallup and Sachs (2001) conjecture that malaria deters
FDI.
4
The interest in human capital is partly attributable to recent trends in investment flows away from the primary
goods sector toward the services sector, thereby increasing the demand for skilled labor inputs. Thus investigators
have hypothesized that locations where the accumulated level of human capital is high may attract greater FDI
inflows (Blomström and Kokko, 2003; Noorbakhsh and Paloni, 2001). However, most cross-country studies identify
human capital narrowly with education, ignoring strong reasons for considering health as an integral component of
worker productivity, and hence important for determining the distribution of FDI.
5
Globerman and Shapiro (2002) do regress FDI on the human development index (HDI), which is a composite of
the following: GDP per capita, educational literacy, and enrollment and life expectancy at birth. We directly
investigate the effect of health on FDI.
6
The 20 major petroleum producers are Algeria, Angola, Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Republic of Congo, Gabon,
Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Syrian Arab Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and Yemen (based on the
classification
by
the
United
Nations
Conference
on
Trade
and
Development—see
http://www.unctad.org/Templates/WebFlyer.asp?intItemID=2162&lang=1).
7
We calculated gross FDI inflows using the following two relationships:
gross FDI (% GDP) = gross inflows FDI (% GDP) + gross outflows FDI (% GDP)
and
net inflows FDI (%GDP) = gross inflows FDI (% GDP) – gross outflows FDI (% GDP)
Hence,
gross FDI inflows (% GDP) = [gross FDI (% GDP) + net inflows FDI (% GDP)] /2
We multiply this by GDP (constant 1995 US$) to obtain gross FDI inflows.
8
Because data are not available for 1980, we used the earliest available data (usually around 1983 to 1987) for the
index of corruption and quality of bureaucratic institutions for both time periods. Geographic and distance variables
are constant.
9
In the World Bank (2003) categorization, the low- and middle-income group (all developing economies) includes
those countries in which the 2001 gross national income per capita was US $9,205 or less, as measured in current
US dollars. The high-income economies are those in which the 2001 gross national income per capita was US
$9,206 or more.
10
For example, taking regression 1, the F-test (distributed as a chi-square (7, 121)) yields a statistic of 2.18, which
leads us to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients reported in the two sub-samples are the same at the 5%
significance level. We also reject the commonality of coefficients in regression specification 2, but cannot the null
hypothesis of equality for regression specifications 3 and 4.
