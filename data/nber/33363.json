    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes a process for automatically generating academic finance papers using large language models (LLMs). It demonstrates the process\u2019 efficacy by producing hundreds of complete papers on stock return predictability, a topic particularly well-suited for our illustration. We first mine over 30,000 potential stock return predictor signals from accounting data, and apply the Novy-Marx and Velikov (2024) \u201cAssaying Anomalies\u201d protocol to generate standardized \u201ctemplate reports\u201d for 96 signals that pass the protocol\u2019s rigorous criteria. Each report details a signal\u2019s performance predicting stock returns using a wide array of tests and benchmarks it to more than 200 other known anomalies. Finally, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to generate three distinct complete versions of academic papers for each signal. The different versions include creative names for the signals, contain custom introductions providing different theoretical justifications for the observed predictability patterns, and incorporate citations to existing (and, on occasion, imagined) literature supporting their respective claims. This experiment illustrates AI\u2019s potential for enhancing financial research efficiency, but also serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating how it can be abused to industrialize HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known).\n\n",
