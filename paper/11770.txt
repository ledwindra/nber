ABSTRACT
We examine the effect of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of drug treatment on an important
health habit, physical exercise. By learning the existence of a new drug treatment via DTCA, rational
consumers may become careless about maintaining healthy lifestyles. Using the National Health Insurance
Survey (NHIS) and MSA-level DTCA data, we find that the DTCA related to four chronic conditions
-- diabetes, high cholesterol, over weight, and hypertension -- reduce the likelihood of engaging in
moderate exercise. This suggests the possibility that DTCA does not only affect pharmaceutical demand
in the short-run, but also have long-run impacts on people's health by affecting their daily routines.

Introduction

Prior to 1997, direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs were largely limited
to print media. A DTCA that contains both brand names and medical claims had to include a
“brief summary” of comprehensive risk information, which made TV advertising prohibitively
expensive. In August 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a clarification that
a brief summary is no longer required for electric media.1 Subsequently, DTCA experienced a
three-hold growth from $800 million in 1996 to $2.5 billion in 2000.
The large increase in the DTCA expenditures created a controversy over the role of prescription drug advertising. Proponents claim that DTCA is informative and educational, while
the opponents argue DTCA conveys inaccurate information, promotes the inappropriate uses of
drugs, and encourages the demand for more expensive drugs.2 In this paper, we contribute to
the debate by examining the effects of DTCA on individual health habit. Ex-ante, it is difficult
to predict the net impact of DTCA on people’s routines. On the one hand, DTCA informs
consumers of the existence of new drug treatments. As a result, rational consumers may care
less about maintaining healthy lifestyles because they know drug treatments are available should
they become sick. On the other hand, DTCA may alert people to adopt or keep healthy habits
by reminding them that there are various diseases they might suffer and that there are potential
treatments out there. The objective of the paper is to understand which of the two roles of
advertising is more prevalent.
To distinguish these possibilities, we analyze the effect of DTCA of drug treatment on an
important health habit, physical exercise. We obtain information on individual health habits
from a national representative survey, the National Health Insurance Survey (NHIS 1997-2001).
The survey data are combined with monthly, MSA-level DTCA data by time and location.
We focus on the DTCA of prescription drugs related to four chronic conditions — diabetes,
hypertension, high cholesterol, and overweight. According to medical experts, exercise is not
only beneficial to people who currently suffer any one of the four conditions, but also help healthy

DTCA still needs to include a “major statement” of the most important risks and refer consumers to other

sources for more comprehensive information.

people to keep away from the four conditions. Our aim is to examine whether the change in
DTCA across time and region explains people’s exercise habit.
Estimation results indicate that the DTCA related to the four conditions decreases the
likelihood of moderate exercise (but has an insignificant impact on vigorous exercise). One
explanation for this is that, by learning the existence of a drug treatment, people substitute
away from moderate exercise. For both types of exercise, the effect does not vary significantly
across the patients that have or do not have the four chronic conditions. Nor do they vary
significantly by gender, age, education, insurance status, or other demographics. When we
examine the impact of DTCA separately for the two most advertised classes (diabetes and
cholesterol reducing), we find that the reduction in moderate exercise is mostly driven by the
DTCA of cholesterol reducing drugs. One explanation is that individuals believe the substitution
between drug treatment and exercise is stronger in cholesterol reducing than in diabetes.
We believe this paper contributes to two strands of literatures. First, our paper joins
the growing literature that examines the economics of prescription drug advertising. So far,
most of the existing studies have focused on DTCA’s impact on the immediate demand of
pharmaceuticals. That is, the focus has been i) whether DTCA motivated consumers to visit
physician office (e.g., Rosenthal et al. 2003 and Iizuka and Jin 2005) or ii) whether DTCA
affected doctor’s prescription behavior once patients arrived at physician office (e.g., Rosenthal
et al. 2003, Iizuka and Jin 2006, and Wosinska 2002).3 In this paper, instead of examining the
immediate demand effects of DTCA, we examine whether DTCA affects people’s daily health
habits. Our findings suggest that DTCA could worsen individual health habits and generate
even greater drug demand in the long run, adding burden to the parties that eventually bear
the cost of medical treatments.
Our paper is also related to a broader literature in moral hazard. Economists have argued
that regulations that intend to enhance product safety may motivate consumers to engage in
riskier behavior or to become less cautious about safety. As a result, the benefit of a safer product
design may be offset by the consumers’ riskier behavior. This argument has found empirical
support in several contexts: Peltzman (1975), for example, studied the highway fatality rate
before and after the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. He found that the
3

Iizuka (2004) and Avery et al. (2004) are the exceptions.

regulation did not decrease highway fatality at all. In fact, some auto occupants’ lives were saved
at the cost of more pedestrian deaths and more nonfatal accidents, suggesting that drivers had
increased driving intensity after the regulation.4 Viscusi(1985) examined the number of home
accidents before and after the establishment of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Like
Peltzman, he found no change in the number of accidents. His case study on protective bottle
caps suggested that the regulation may have a lulling effect on consumer behavior: parents had
less incentive to reduce children access to drugs and many safety cap bottles were left open.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the theoretical arguments
as to how DTCA would affect individual health habits and how such impact may differ by
demographics. After data description in Section 3, we set up an empirical model and discuss
identification issues in Section 4. Estimation results are reported in Section 5, and conclusion
is offered in Section 6.

Potential Impacts of DTCA on Exercise

Consider an individual choosing to exercise or not in order to maximize his total utility of life:
U=

TX
−age

δ t ut (rt , qt , et )

t=0

where t denotes time (t = 0 for present), T denotes expected life expectancy, δ is the annual
discount rate, r is the perceived risk of contracting diseases, q is the quality of life, and e is
exercise intensity (a dummy variable in our case). In the short run, exercise may generate
disutility as it costs time and money. In the long run, exercise may reduce the probability of
contracting certain diseases (r) thus increasing life expectancy (T ) and the quality of life (q). A
rational consumer would choose a sequence of et so that it will maximize U .
A DTCA of drug treatment may affect the total utility of the consumer thus the choice
of exercise in many ways. First, consider a healthy individual who currently does not suffer any
“lifestyle diseases” such as diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and over weight. On
4

Driving intensity consists of driving speed, passing frequency, willingness to drive under adverse conditions,

etc. Using the same methodology, Stuart (1980) found little evidence for driving intensity offsetting the intended
impacts of the Swedish traffic safety regulation. One explanation is that the Swedish regulation of physical vehicle
safety was 50% stronger than the American and the Swedish regulation was accompanied with lower speed limits.

3

the one hand, a DTCA of drug treatment may tell her that there is a new treatment should
she gets sick, so life expectancy (T ) and the quality of future life (q) would remain high even if
she does not exercise today. In this case, the expected drug treatment communicated by DTCA
serves as a substitute for physical exercise, and a higher DTCA may result in lower exercise
intensity.5 On the other hand, by communicating various medical problems that one might
suffer, a DTCA may increase the perceived risk of contracting the targeted disease (r). If so,
DTCA may encourage the person to do more exercise.
For those who currently suffer a DTCA-targeted disease, the effects of DTCA can be more
complex. In the simplest case, if an individual suffers the targeted disease and knows the existence of the advertised drug, the DTCA may deliver no new information and therefore has little
impact on exercise habit. However, if the patient didn’t know the existence of the drug treatment, DTCA may have the same effects as in the case of the healthy individual. Furthermore,
if the patient seeks the treatment after observing an ad,6 DTCA can have additional effects.
If the doctor prescribes the requested drug, which generates immediate benefits and reduces
the incentives to exercise, we may observe a negative relationship between DTCA and exercise
intensity. If, on the other hand, the doctor refuses prescribing the drug and urges the patient to
exercise first7 , the propensity to exercise may increase with DTCA. Unfortunately, we cannot
isolate these explanations since we only observe DTCA data at the MSA level and the NHIS
does not report whether an individual has visited doctors for a specific condition or obtained a
specific drug in a specific time window.
The effects of DTCA may further vary by demographics and other individual attributes.
For example, if the advertised treatment is paid by a third party other than the patient himself,
one may expect greater benefits from the treatment. This suggests that, if DTCA has an effect
to reduce exercise for some people, it is more likely to show up for the insured population than
for the uninsured. Also, the decision to exercise depends on the individual’s perception of risk,
the individual’s ability to compare today’s cost and tomorrow’s benefits, and the individual’s
discount factor. To the extent that these factors differ by age and education, the effects of
5

Of course, if drug treatment and exercise are viewed as complements rather than substitutes, the effect could

be reversed.
6
Iizuka and Jin, 2005, shows that DTCA has an effect of increasing physician office visits.
7
According to the FDA 1999 and 2002 surveys, 22% of the doctors that do not prescribe a drug as the result
of DTCA ask patients to change behavior or lifestyles (Aikin 2003).

DTCA may vary by age and education as well.

Data

We combine two data sets, NHIS (1997-2001) and DTCA data (1996-2001), to analyze the
impact of DTCA on health habits. NHIS aims at monitoring the health of the United States
population through the collection and analysis of data on a broad range of health topics. NHIS
is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through household interviews.
The sampling plan follows a multistage area probability design to achieve a representative sample
of households.
Our DTCA data contain DTCA expenditures of prescription drugs. Collected by the
TNS Media Intelligence/Competitive Media Reporting (CMR), this data set includes DTCA
expenditures by drug, month and MSA. Specifically, CMR monitors advertising outlays via
DTC channels in units and dollars, including network TV, cable TV, newspapers, and magazines.
These outlays can further be decomposed into two levels: national and local advertising, where
local means DTCA through spot TV, spot radio, newspapers, and outdoor billboards at the
MSA level.
Because national advertising applies to all areas, it is difficult to disentangle the impact
of national advertising from the overall trend of exercise intensity. To circumvent this difficulty,
we exploit the geographic variations in DTCA. Available since 1996, the local DTCA data cover
75 MSAs, of which 58 are identifiable in the NHIS. The matching is imperfect because NHIS
only discloses the identity of large MSAs.
Given the fact that advertising may not depreciate completely within a month, we define
the independent variable– SU M DT CA–as the accumulative sum of monthly local DTCA within
the last 12 months for all drugs in the relevant drug category (see Section 4 for more details
as to why we choose this specific definition). To create this accumulative DTCA variable, we
obtain DTCA data from 1996 to 2001 and match them with the 1997-2001 data from the NHIS
by time and MSA. All the DTCA data are deflated to 1996 US dollars. We don’t consider
direct-to-doctor advertising (DTDA) of prescription drugs, because individuals are not directly
exposed to DTDA and the existing data on DTDA don’t distinguish advertising intensity by
5

location.
In the analysis sample, we focus on the NHIS interviewed individuals that live in the 58DTCA-matched MSAs and have valid data on height, weight, and whether they have any of the
four conditions. Because emotional feeling has important power explaining exercise propensity,
we further restrict the sample to the individuals that answer to the question of whether they
feel sad, helpless, or worthless in all or most of the time in the past 30 days.8 This results in
the final sample of 76,792 indivdiuals throughout 1997-2001.

Empirical Model

4.1

The Effect of DTCA on Exercise Behavior

In this section we discuss our empirical approach to examine the impact of DTCA on exercise
habits. As noted before, DTCA may reduce exercise by informing people that there is a possible
alternative, drug treatments, to deal with their health problems. It is also possible that DTCA
reminds people of the diseases that they may suffer more from if they do not exercise. Ex-ante,
it is difficult to predict the net impact of DTCA on exercise habits.
We pay special attention to four categories of conditions – overweight, high cholesterol,
high blood pressure, and diabetes. These are important risk factors, and experts say that
frequent physical activity help reduce these risk factors. Surgeon General, for example, recommends at least 30 minutes of physical activity everyday, because physical activity helps lose
or maintain weight, prevents heart diseases, helps control cholesterol levels and diabetes, slows
bone loss associated with advancing age, lowers the risk of certain cancers, and helps reduce
anxiety and depression.9 Similarly, American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends getting
physical activity every day to lower the risk for heart attack, stroke, and other diabetes problems.10 The benefits of physical activities appear to be also recognized by the general public.

For example, according to an obesity poll conducted by Harvard School of Public Health in
June 2005, 52% (and 42%) of respondents agreed that increasing one’s physical activity level is
“extremely important” (and “very important”) in maintaining a healthy weight.11 Thus, the
benefits of physical exercise on chronic diseases, including the above four conditions, appear to
be well understood.12
Our empirical approach is to sum up the DTCA of all the prescription drugs that fall into
the four categories and examine their aggregate impact on the extent of physical activity. We
adopt the following linear probability specification in our base model:
M ODEXEikt = αk + βt + Demogikt · Π
+SU M DT CA4kt · {γ0 + γ1 · 4Conditionikt } + ikt

V IGEXEikt = αk + βt + Demogikt · Π
+SU M DT CA4kt · {γ0 + γ1 · 4Conditionikt } + ikt
where M ODEXEikt (V IGEXEikt ) equal to 1 if individual i in MSA k at quarter t engages
in moderate (vigorous) physical activities for at least 10 minutes per week and 0 otherwise.
Moderate activities are defined as the activities that cause only light sweating or a slight to
moderate increase in breathing or heart rate. Examples of moderate activities include brisk
walking, bicycling, vacuuming, and gardening. In contrast, vigorous activities cause heavy
sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate. Typical examples are running, aerobics,
and heavy yard work.13 We estimate the above two regressions separately.
11

12
Exercise may also alleviate or prevent depression. However, NHIS does not specify who have depression and
who don’t. In a robustness check, we code depression as being sad, hopeless and/or worthless in all or most of
the time in the past 30 days. By this definition, including depression as one of the exercise-sensitive conditions
do not affect our main results. Results including depression are available upon request.
13
Besides M ODEXE and V IGEXE, the NHIS also asks questions regarding exercise frequency and the
length of exercise per time. From these questions we can calculate the number of minutes an individual engage
in moderate or vigorous activities per week. This is no systematic difference in exercise intensity among lowand high-risk population once we condition on exercising. We have run the same regression specifications and
find no relationship between DTCA and exercise intensity. Also, the regressions have little power explaining any
variations in exercise intensity (R-squared is no bigger than 2%). For these reasons, we focus on the tendency to
exercise rather than exercise intensity. Results about exercise intensity are available upon request.

7

The key independent variable in the above models is SU M DT CA4kt , which denotes the
12-month sum of DTCA expenditures in MSA k at time t, targeting any one of the above four
conditions. We include only local-level advertising in SU M DT CA4kt since national DTCA are
common across MSAs and its impact is non-distinguishable from an arbitrary time trend of
exercise behaviors. Besides SU M DT CA, we include αk and βt as MSA and time fixed effects,
respectively. DEM OG controls for an extensive set of individual characteristics, including age,
gender, race, education, income categories, health insurance coverage, and self-reported health
conditions. DEM OG also includes a full set of dummies describing whether an individual feels
sad, has diabetes, has high cholesterol, has hypertension, or is over-weight.
As elaborated in Section 2, the individuals subject to any one of the four health risks
may react to DTCA differently from the other individuals. In accordance, we define a dummy
variable 4Condition that equals to 1 for the “high-risk” people who suffer at least one of the
four conditions, and 0 for the remaining “low risk” people. In the regression, we include the
interaction between 4Condition and SU M DT CA4 (recall that each of the four conditions has
been controlled separately in DEM OG) to capture the differential effects of DTCA on highand low-risk people.
We estimate the base models using linear specifications that allow us to take into account
the complex sampling scheme of the NHIS data and to use instrumental variables (to be discussed later). However, we also estimated logit models (without instrumental variables) in our
preliminary analysis. Since the logit results are similar to the results from the base models, we
only report the results from the base models in the results section below.14
Following the discussions in Section 2, we can extend the base models by further allowing
the heterogeneous effects of DTCA across the population. For example, the first equation above
can be modified as follows by adding a number of interactions between DTCA and individual
attributes:
M ODEXEikt = αk + βt + DEM OGikt · Π
+ SU M DT CA4kt · {γ0 + γ1 · 4Conditionikt + γ2 · F EM ALEikt
+ γ3 · W HIT Eikt + γ4 · COLLEGEikt + γ5 · IN C20Kikt
+ γ6 · AGEikt + γ7 · IN SU REDikt } + ikt
14

The logit results are available from the authors upon request.

8

where COLLEGEikt equal to 1 if individual i in MSA k at month t has college education or
higher and 0 otherwise. IN C20K equal to 1 if one’s annual income is higher than $20,000 and
0 otherwise. We define AGE as the deviation from the sample mean (45), so that γ1 represents
the effect of SUMDTCA on a person of average age who is male, non-white, uninsured, free of
the four chronic conditions, with education less than college and income less than $20,000 per
year. By definition, BMI (body mass index) is highly correlated with whether an individual is
over-weight or not. Since we have included over-weight in 4Condition, we do not control for
BM I or include an interaction between BM I and SU M DT CA4 in the main specification.
An obvious alternative specification to the above base models is to distinguish the four drug
categories one by one. Unfortunately, we were unable to estimate such models for two reasons.
First, there are limited variations in hypertension and weight-loss DTCA (more details to be
discussed in Table 2), which hinders our ability to estimate a separate coefficient of SU M DT CA
for each of the four drug classes. In a robustness check shown below, we examine the two most
advertised classes (diabetes and cholesterol reducing) separately. Moreover, to the extent that
the four disease conditions are closely correlated, it is conceivable that DTCA on one condition
may have an effect for patients with another condition. This concern leads us to believe that
grouping them together is a reasonable approach.

4.2

Identification issues

This subsection discusses three issues: the potential endogeneity of DTCA variables, the potential noise in self-reported body size measures (height and weight), and the alternative ways to
account for DTCA depreciation over time.

4.2.1

Endogeneity of DTCA variables

We realize that our DTCA variables may be endogeneous. For example, pharmaceutical firms
may target their advertising efforts to the markets where advertising are likely to be effective.
For example, drug companies may advertise more on weight-loss medicines in the MSAs where
people engage in little physical activities. While the MSA fixed effects in the regressions mitigate
this problem, they do not eliminate the potential correlation in the time-varying components of

9

advertising intensity and individual health habits.
To solve the endogeneity problem, we consider two instruments. The first is the same
drug companies’ DTCA expenditures in all other classes in all other MSAs. We label the
instruments as SU M DT CA4−kt (for SU M DT CA4kt ). We argue that DTCA across classes and
MSAs are correlated within the same company, either because the company pursues a particular
marketing strategy for all products and regions or because different drugs and regions are subject
to a common advertising budget. To the extent that the local DTCA of different products in
different regions are unlikely to affect peoples’ exercise decisions in the studied market, they
are valid instruments. Similar instruments have been used in the previous literature, including
Berndt et al. (1995) and Iizuka and Jin (2005).
The second instrument utilizes the wage data of advertising related jobs reported in Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) between 1997 and 2001. Each year OES reports detailed
wage estimates of over 700 occupations for all MSAs.15 Among these occupations, we look at
four categories that would capture the cost of media production, which in turn would affect
the cost of DTCA in each area. They are i) broadcast technicians, ii) announcers: radio and
television, iii) news analysts, reporters and correspondents, and iv) camera operators: television,
video, and motion picture. In each MSA, we use the weighted sum of wage estimates for these
four groups of occupations as an instrument for DTCA expenditure, where the weight is equal
to the total employment by occupation by year. The use of OES average wage as instrument
for DTCA entails the assumption that drug advertising constitutes a small fraction of all the
advertising implemented in the related medias and pharmaceutical companies take the cost of
advertising as given. By adding in the two instruments improves the first stage R-squared from
0.8337 to 0.8398. Both instruments make significant contribution to explaining the variations
in SU M DT CA4kt , but SU M DT CA4−kt is relatively more powerful, probably because DTCA
advertising related to the four conditions involve a lot of pharmaceutical companies whose advertising in other categories vary greatly across time and MSA. For the sake of robustness, we
have run the instrumental regressions in two ways: one uses both instruments, and the other
uses the OES average wage only. Results are qualitatively similar, though the regressions with
15

OES used a 5-digit classification system between 1997 and 1998 but changed it to a 6-digit system in 1999.

However, the occupation categories we use for this analysis didn’t change except for minor changes in wording
before and after 1999.

10

both instruments deliver more precision. In all cases, Hausman test cannot reject the exogeneity
of SU M DT CA4kt . So in section 5 we report the IV results using both instruments, but focus
most of the discussion on the OLS.

4.3

Measurement errors in height and weight

Previous researchers have expressed concerns regarding measurement errors in self-reported
height and weight (Rowland 1989). Since we use body mass index (BMI) to define one of the
four “high-risk” conditions and BMI is calculated from self-reported height and weight in the
NHIS, measurement errors may generate systematic bias. We follow Cawley (2004) to correct
the bias.16
Specifically, we assess the degree of measurement errors by using the third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) which reports height and weight from both
self report and physical examination. In the first step, we regress actual weight as a polynomial
function of the reported weight (up to power of five) in NHANES III. Then we use the estimated
relationship to predict the actual weight in the NHIS. To account for the possibility that different
demographic groups may have different reporting errors, this process is carried out for 12 groups
separately, where group is defined by race (white vs. non-white), gender, and age (18-39, 40-64
and 65+). Same procedure is repeated for height. After obtaining predicted height and weight,
we recalculate the body mass index and use it to define an individual overweight if the corrected
BMI is greater than 25.
For both height and weight, we achieve high R-squares in the first step (0.8-0.9 on average)
and results are very similar no matter whether we use the original or the corrected BMI. We
have also tried the alternative definition of overweight (BM I > 30) and results do not change
in any significant way. In light of the robustness, Section 5 only reports the results with the
corrected BMI under the standard definition of overweight (BM I > 25).
16

The general strategy is outlined in Lee and Sepanski (1995) and Bound et al. (2002)

11

4.4

DTCA depreciation

Any study on the effect of advertising would involve some discussion on the depreciation rate
of advertising. Ideally, if we have long enough data on advertising intensity, we can introduce
a parameter to represent monthly depreciation rate, use it to construct the discounted sum
of advertising intensity up to the interview time, and estimate the depreciation rate with the
other parameters in the nonlinear model (see Iizuka and Jin, 2006, for such an attempt). We are
unable to follow this strategy in this paper, mainly because we have no pre-1996 data on the total
advertising intensity by category and MSA. Instead, our main results use a simple 12-month sum
of DTCA to proxy the accumulated DTCA exposure up to the interview time. For robustness
check, we also use the monthly depreciation rate estimated in our previous paper (0.9672, Iizuka
and Jin, 2005) to compute the discounted sum of DTCA. This alternative approach entails an
assumption of zero DTCA before 1996. Both specifications generate similar results, suggesting
that our results are robust to different depreciation assumptions.

Results
Data summary

Table 1 summarizes exercise variables in the NHIS. Panel A Shows the percentage of population
that has ever been told by doctor of having diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, or is overweighed at the time of interview. Over 60% of the population are at the risk of at least one of
the four conditions, and this percentage has increased steadily over time (from 64.81% in 1997
to 66.84% in 2001). The trend is particularly driven by people getting overweight and facing
higher risk of diabetes over time. In comparison, changes in hypertension and high cholesterol
are non-monotone: for both conditions, the percentage at risk dropped slightly from 1998 to
2000, and picked up again in 2001.
Panel B summarizes the exercise variables for high-risk and low-risk groups separately.
Perhaps not surprisingly, people at risk of at least one of the four conditions engage in much
less physical activities. Only 35-38% of these high-risk people participates in vigorous exercise
(V IGEXE) for at least 10 minutes per week. The corresponding number for the low-risk people

12

is 44-47%. Similarly, only 47-51% of high-risk individuals exercise moderately (M ODEXE) for
at least 10 minutes a week, lower than that among the low-risk people (52-55%).
Table 2 presents summary statistics for local DTCA expenditures targeting diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol reducing, and weight control. Panel A reports the mean and standard
deviation of local DTCA spent in each category in each quarter across all the 58 MSAs included
in our NHIS and DTCA data. Note that these numbers only include the DTCA via local medias, hence much smaller than the overall DTCA spent nationwide. Among the four conditions,
DTCA is more intensive for diabetes and cholesterol reducing, probably because the potential
drug markets for these two conditions are much larger than the other two. The over-time variation is also striking: the local DTCA of hypertension drugs was positive only in 1996, while the
annual DTCA sum of diabetes and cholesterol reducing drugs tripled from 2000 to 2001.
Panel B reports the percentage of zero advertising by MSA, quarter, and category. This
is to further examine how much variations we have in our MSA DTCA data. Panel B indicates
that local DTCA has been used in many MSAs especially for diabetes and cholesterol reducing
drugs in recent years. This will help us identifying the impact of DTCA on health habit. In
contrast, local DTCA expenditures for hypertension and weight control drugs do not exist in
many MSAs overtime. This suggests that these DTCA may not have much explanatory power.
Based on this observation, we will also estimate a model that focuses only on local DTCA of
diabetes and cholesterol reducing drugs.
In Panel C, conditional on non-zero advertising, we further report the mean and standard
deviation of local DTCA by quarter, MSA, and category. This shows that the standard deviation
of local DTCA is often close to or larger than the mean itself. Since this table bounds DTCA
above zero, this suggests that DTCA varies greatly across MSAs and quarters. Overall, there is
a substantial variation in local DTCA across time and location, and it will help us to identify
the effect of DTCA on exercise habits.

Estimation Results

Tables 3 and 4 report the results on moderate and vigorous exercise, respectively. In each table,
we report four columns for the determinants of whether to participate in exercise (M ODEXE

13

and V IGEXE). The first two columns report the OLS and IV results for the basic model, the
next two columns include the interaction of SU M DT CA4 and demographics, and the last two
columns focus on the two heavily advertised classes (diabetes and cholesterol reducing) and allow
the DTCA coefficients to differ by class. To allow high- and low-risk populations to respond
to DTCA differently, we include the interaction between SU M DT CA4 and 4CON DIT ION in
Columns 1-4. This interaction becomes class-specific in Columns 5-6. We only report DTCA
related variables in the table, but all regressions include a full set of year-quarter dummies, a
full set of MSA dummies, detailed demographics such as race, gender, age, income categories,
insurance status, the existence of certain health conditions, and self-reported health status. All
regressions take into account of stratification, primary sample unit, and sampling weight.
Four patterns are worth noting. First, focusing on the basic model, estimates suggest
that DTCA tends to lower the propensity of moderate exercise but has no significant impact
on vigorous exercise. This result is robust after we apply the instrumental variables, which
suggests that the OLS effect is unlikely driven by targeted advertising. Moreover, the impact
of DTCA does not vary much for high- and low-risk individuals. More specifically, the OLS
coefficients (Column 1) suggest that one-million increase in SU M DT CA4 is associated with a
1.64 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of moderate exercise for healthy people, and a
1.43 percentage point reduction for people that have at least one of the four chronic conditions.
The difference is small and insignificant. When we use instruments (Column 2), the reduction of
moderate exercise becomes stronger and more significant for the high-risk population (9% versus
7.71% for the low risk), but the difference remains small. We note that, for all regressions in this
paper, Hausman test does not reject the null hypothesis of DTCA being exogenous (conditional
on we have valid instruments.) Thus, although we report instrumental variable results for all
regressions, we take the OLS results as our primary results in this paper.
In columns 3 and 4, we report the results that add interaction terms between DTCA and
demographics to the previous regressions. For both moderate and vigorous exercise, the effect
of DTCA tends to be more negative for the educated people, more negative for the insured, and
more positive for those with income over $20k. These signs are consistent with the notion that the
third-party payment, the ability to calculate the tradeoff between today and tomorrow, and the
lack of high income intensify the tendency to substitute away from exercise. It should be noted,
however, that most OLS coefficients for these interactions do not pass the conventional confidence

14

level. Although using instruments makes them larger and statistically more significant, as before,
Hausman test does not reject the null of DTCA being exogenous. For this reason, the differential
effects of DTCA across the population are not conclusive.
Finally, when we examine diabetes and cholesterol reducing separately, it is clear that the
reduction of moderate exercise is largely driven by the DTCA of cholesterol reducing drugs (see
columns 5 and 6). One explanation for this is that individuals tend to view that drug treatment
and physical exercise are substitutable for lowering cholesterol but less so for the control of
diabetes. Like in the basic model reported in columns 1 and 2, the effect of DTCA does not
depend on whether an individual has high cholesterol or diabetes. In an unreported table, we
also allow the DTCA of cholesterol reducing and diabetes to interact with demographics. The
signs of the key coefficients remain unchanged, and the interaction terms paint a similar picture
as before: the effect of DTCA on (both moderate and vigorous) exercise tends to be more
negative for the insured, the educated, and the ones with income less than $20k. However, none
of them are statistically significant.
To summarize, we find that DTCA of prescription drugs tend to decrease the likelihood
of engaging in moderate exercise. In some specifications, this negative impact is stronger for
the insured, the educated, and the people that currently suffer from one of the four conditions,
but the difference is often statistically insignificant. When we examine the effect of DTCA
separately for the two most advertised classes (diabetes and cholesterol reducing), we find that
the reduction of moderate exercise is largely driven by the cholesterol reducing advertising.
This suggests that exercise and drug treatment is perceived more substitutable for cholesterol
reducing than for diabetes.

Conclusion

This paper examined the effect of DTCA of an important health habit, physical exercise. According to the estimation results, the DTCA of four conditions — diabetes, hypertension, high
cholesterol, and overweight — appears to decrease the likelihood of moderate exercise. This
suggests the possibility that DTCA of drug treatments may have encouraged (at least some)
people to substitute away from healthy lifestyles. While most of the existing research examines

15

the immediate effect of DTCA on pharmaceutical demand, our results indicate that DTCA may
affect consumers even more broadly by changing their daily routines. The fact that DTCA encourages unhealthy habits may have long run impacts on the nation’s health status and overall
health care expenditure. Future research should explore the mechanisms by which the DTCA
affects health habits, which may provide further insights into how policy makers should regulate
the DTCA of prescription drugs.
