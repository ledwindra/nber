    "abstract": "\n\nCan investing in children who faced adverse events in early childhood help them catch up? We answer this question using two orthogonal sources of variation \u2013 resource availability at birth (local rainfall) and cash incentives for school enrollment \u2013 to identify the interaction between early endowments and investments in children. We find that adverse rainfall in the year of birth decreases grade attainment, post-secondary enrollment, and employment outcomes. But children whose families were randomized to receive conditional cash transfers experienced a much smaller decline: each additional year of program exposure during childhood mitigated more than 20 percent of early disadvantage.\n\n",
