Consistent Simple Sum
Aggregation Over Assets

ABSTRACT

This paper discusses the issue of consistent simple sum aggregation
over assets within the context of expected utility maximizing investors.
The first part of the paper extends the Hicks and Leontief aggregation

theorems of consumer choice theory to the portfolio choice problem. Next,
necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent simple sum aggregation
are derived for Nerton's (1973) continuous—time trading model of investor

behavior. Results relating to the construction of consistent rate of
return indices for simple sum composite assets are also presented.

Consistent Simple Sum Aggregation Over Assets

I. Introduction
Recently, a number of empirical studies have sought to model the
portfolio behavior of selected investor groups by estimating their demands

for various types of assets.1 These demand equations reflect numerous
simplifying assumptions intended to render the specif-ication and estimation

tasks less formidable. One common simplification involves aggregating over
assets in order to reduce the dimensionality of the universe of assets to
be considered and, therefore, the number of parameters to be estimated

in the model. Quantity indices in these studies are usually taken to be
simple sum aggregates over assets.2
Implicitly, the justification for simple sum aggregation in these
studies involves decomposing the universe of assets into a tractable number
of mutually exclusive groups (e.g., common stocks, long—term corporate bonds,
mortgages, etc.) and then assuming that for the purposes of allocating funds
among these groups the investor treats each dollar invested in one of the
groups as if it is being invested in a single "composite asset't whose pro-

bability distribution of rate of return is some function of the joint distri-

bution of the rates of return of the assets in the group.3 Demand equations
for simple sum quantity aggregates of assets (e.g., the amounts of dollars
invested in long—term corporate bonds, equities, etc.) may then be formally
expressed as functions of the joint probability distribution of rate of
return indices for these aggregates.

—2—
In this literature seldom is any attention given to the conditions
which must prevail in order for the above assumption to be valid for a
4

given simple sum aggregation scheme.

That is, given a particular set of

asset groupings, when can one formulate the investor choice problem in terms
of simple sum "composite assets" in such a way that its solution generates
the same allocation of funds among asset groups as does the investor's
original choice problem formulated in terms of the individual assets?
Equivalently, when is it valid to "assume" that an investor treats each dollar
invested in one of the groups as a whole as if it is being invested in a single asset
whose rate of return depends only upon the joint probability distribution of the

rates of return of the members of the group? A related issue concerns how
the rate of return indices for these composite assets should be constructed.
The primary purpose of this paper is to provide answers to the above

questions. Briefly, the plan of the paper is as follows. In Section II the
expected utility maximization framework of this paper is reviewed and the
concepts of consistent simple sum aggregation and consistent rate of return
index are defined.

Two asset aggregation theorems analogous to the Hicks and Leontlef
aggregation theorem of consumer choice theory are presented in Section III.
Section IV concerns itself with the issues of consistent aggregation
and consistent rate of return indices within the mean—variance context of

Merton's (1973) continuous—time portfolio choice model. Therein, necessary
and sufficient conditions for consistent simple sum aggregation over assets within

this framework are presented. One implication of our results is that a group

—3—
of assets need not be perfect substitutes in order for simple sum

aggre-

gation over these assets to be consistent.5 Closed—form expressions for
consistent rate of return indices are also derived.

II. Consistent Simple Sum Aggregation and Consistent Rate of Return Indices
Consider a von Neu'mann—Morgenstern investor whose portfolio choice

problem consists of allocating wealth W among "k" assets at the beginning
of a period so as to maximize the expected utility of end—of—period wealth.
Mathematically, his task can be formulated as the following constrained
optimization problem:

(1)

k

maximize

A

1=1

k
subject to:

where

A =

-

EtU[E A R.]1
i=l

the

A. = W

amount of dollars inyested in the i' asset at

the beginning of the period,

E{.}

the expectation operator,

U[.] =

the investor's von Neumann—Morgenstern (v—M) utility
function (assumed to display nonsatiation and risk
aversion), and

=

the gross real after—tax rate of return on the th asset
during the period.

If the joint probability distribution of the R is denoted by
P(Rl,...,Rk), then the solution to the portfolio choice problem (1) takes the
form:
(2)

A1 =

A[P(R1.. ,R.K);

W; U]

for

1=1,.. ,k.

—4—
The optimal allocation of funds depends upon the joint probability distribution of rates of return, the level of initial wealth and the form of the
investor's v—M utility function.

It will prove convenient below to rewrite (1) and (2) in vector notation:
(1')

maximize

E{u[ATR]}

subject to: 1TAW
=

(2')

A*[P(R);WU]

where an underscore L) denotes a vector quantity and 1 denotes an appropriately dimensioned column vector of ones.
In the real world the number of assets available to an investor, "k",

may be very large. Consequently, it is usually desirable to aggregate
over assets, creating a fewer number of composite assets, in order to reduce
the dimensionality of problem (1) and thereby make the empirical implementation of the theory more tractable.
To this end, partition the universe of assets into, say, "S"

mutually

exclusive and exhaustive groups of assets where s<k. Conformably partition
and re-order the elements of A and R so that
(3)

We shall say that,relative to the above aggregation scheme, simple sum
aggregation is consistent if we can find a set of rate of return indices
for i—l,.. .

conditions (4) and (5) hold, then the 4 are said to be consistent

rate of return indices for this aggregation scheme.
In words, a particular simple sum aggregation scheme is consistent if the
investor acts as if his allocations to the various asset groups are being

generated by his solving a portfolio choice problemin terms of simple sum
composite assets. The joint probability distribution of these composite assets
is given by P(c1,...,4)) where each 4)

is a function of B.. parameterized by

the marginal probability distribution of B.., P(R). We do not require the

to

utility function in the surrogate (composite asset) choice problem, U ,
be the same as in the original problem, U.

When a simple sum aggregation scheme is consistent each asset group
as a whole can be treated as a single asset for the purposes of modelling

the investor's allocation of funds among asset groups. The appropriate rate
of return index is given by the random variable

while the quantity index for

the group is simply the amount of dollars invested in the group as a whole.
If a particular aggregation scheme is not consistent in the above
sense then the paradigm of portfolio behavior discussed in the introduction

is an invalid characterization of the portfolio allocation process. Hence,
if a proposed simple sum aggregation scheme consisting of equities, bonds
and mortgages is not consistent then, in a strict sense, it is meaningless
to talk of the investor's demand for equities vis-a-vis bonds and mortgages.

Equivalently, in the absence of consistent simple sum aggregation a system
of demand equations for these composite assets derivable from expected utility
maximization will not exist.

-6-

III. The Hicks and Leontief Asset Aggregation Theorems
For general v—M expected utility maximizers two asset aggregation
theorems may be proved which are analogous to the Hicks and Leontief aggregation theorems of consumer choice theory:

Theorem 1: (Hicks Aggregation Theorem) If short sales are precluded6 and a limited liability asset exists then the 1th group of
assets admit consistent simple sum aggregation if they are character-

I

ized by constant relative rates of return (i.e., if R = d R for some

constant positive vector d and scalar random variable R ).

In

this

instance, the consistent rate of return index for this group,

satisfying

-

1Tg=1) In this instance, the consistent rate of return

index for this group is given by 4

gT

Proofs may be found in the appendix.
To the author's knowledge, no major investor class is legally, morally or otherwise constrained to hold any group of assets in fixed relative

proportions. Hence, the Leontief Aggregation Theorem is unlikely to have
any practical relevence.
The Hicks Aggregation Theorem, on the other hand, Is potentially
quite useful and is implicitly invoked in many empirical asset

—7—

demand studies. For example, an aggregation scheme which treats all
long—term corporate bonds as a single homogeneous asset may be "approxi-

mately" consistent to the extent that the holding period returns on all
such bonds are thought by market participants to be highly correlated.
A more subtle application of the Hicks Theorem is found in a
7
recent structural study of the U.S. equity market by the author. Therein
it is argued that it is the policy of most institutional investors to

hold well diversified portfolios of equities. In well diversified portfolios, moreover, most of the risk is likely to be systematic: the actual
return on such a portfolio will mimic that of the market equity portfolio
up to a factor of proportionality given by the portfolio's "Beta" coeff i—

dent. The returns for all feasible portfolios, then, are likely to be
highly correlated with that of the market in a subjective ex ante sense.
Hence, the conditions of the Hicks Theorem are likely tl be "approximately"
fulfilled and simple sum aggregation over equities is approximately consistent.

IV. Consistent Simple Sum Aggregation in a Mean-Variance Model

Less restrictive simple sum aggregation conditions than the embodied
in the Hicks and Leontief Theorems can be obtained within the framework of
Merton's (1973) continuous-time consumption-saving-portfolio choice model.
If the instantaneous vector of rates of return follows a Gaussian diffusion

process with instantaneous mean vector r and variance-covariance matrix
Q, and if security trading is costless and permitted to take place continuously in time, then the investor's portfolio choice problem at each instant

—8—
essentially involves solving the following mean-variance problem for the

vector of portfolio shares h (A):8

(6)

hr — (p / 2) hTh

maximize

subject to:

where "p" is the investor's coefficient of relative risk aversion. Below, for
simplicity, we shall assume that the investor displays constant relative risk
aversion and that

is nonsingular.

As Friend, Landskronner and Losq (1976) and Friedman and Roley
(1980) have shown, problem (6) can also be motivated by assuming that trading
takes place discretely provided that holding periods are sufficiently short.
Jones (1979) has also shown that Lintner's (1972) lognormal securities market
model of investor behavior essentially reduces to (6).

Turning our attention now to the issue of consistent simple sum

We seek to know when the first subgroup of assets admit consistent aggregation.

The answer to this question is revealed in the following theorem
which is proved in the appendix:9

Theorem 3: A necessary and sufficient condition for the first
group of assets to admit consistent simple sum aggregation is
that the covariance matrix ci12 is of the form:

p12= L! +
and c2. In this case, the unique con-

for some fixed vectors

sistent rate of return index for the first group of assets is given
by:

where G1 =

that the conditions for consistent aggregation pertain only

to the structure of the covariance matrix

' 22

and are independent of the

and p. Moreover, the unique consistent rate

for the first group is a linear comb±nation of the rates

of return of the assets in the group with weights depending on the van—
ance—covariance matrix of the first group,

, and one of the vectors para—

When the aggregation restriction (9) obtains the optimal vector of
composite asset demands is given by:

—10—

T*

—

where B
and

(1/1T_1) —l 11T—l

=

are the mean vector and variance—covariance matrix associated

and

with the composite asset yield vector r

(1r2). This system, then, has

the same general form as (7). Thus, when consistent simple sum aggregation
obtains, the investor allocates funds among the first group as a whole and

the remaining assets individually as if each dollar allocated to an asset

in the first group is being invested in a single asset with yield 4.
The above theorem also refutes the claim that simple sum aggregation
presumes that the assets of the group to be aggregated are perfect sub-

stitutes. It is clear that a covariance matrix of the form given in (9)
does not imply that the assets in the first group are perfect substitutes
for one another provided that

is nonsingular.

The conditions for consistent aggregation embodied in (9) are quite

restrictive. One model of asset returns, however, which generates this
structure is the following variance—components or factor—model:

=
(12)

=

iil+_ll

2l

+

2

+

+ £22 12

where l' 2' 11 and 12

are independently distributed scalar and vector

random variables with zero means and variance—covariance matrices given by

'

ll

and 22 respectively. Assets of the first and second groups

share two common factors or forcing elements. One of these forcing elements affects all rates of return in the first group identically and the

—11—

other element affects all rates of return in the second group identically

as well. Under these assumptions the covariance matrix between

and £2

is of the form given in (9) and simple sum aggregation over the first
group of assets is consistent.

Above we have assumed that all assets are risky. While this is the
most realistic assumption in a world with uncertain inflation and no indexed
bonds it may be of interest to determine the conditions for consistent

simple sum aggregation when a riskless asset exists. In this case, let
denote the real rate of return on the riskiess asset and ,

r

rf

and Q the

portfolio share vector, mean vector and variance-covariance matrix for the

risky assets respectively. The portfolio choice problem in the presence
of a riskiess asset is then

(11)

maximize

hf.rf +

11T

-.

hTQh

hf, h

subject to: hf ÷ iTh =

1

As before, partition the risky assets into two non-empty mutually exclu-

sive groups and also partition h, r and Q comformably as in (8). Then
we may prove the following result:

12

Theorem 4: A necessary and sufficient condition for the first
subgroup or risky assets to admit consistent simple sum aggregation
is that the covariance matrix Il2 takes the special form:13

-12-

(12)

for

Q12 =

1

some fixed vector

In this case, the unique consistent

rate of return index for the first subgroup of assets is
(13)

4'

= (1TQ_l

)/(1TQ_l 1)15

Again, the aggregation conditions are independent of the structure of p,

and 22 Moreover, it is evident from Theorem 4 that aggregation

-'.2'

across risky assets requires more stringent conditions on the covariance
matrix Cl12 when a riskless asset exists than when one does not exist.

If the restriction that the second group of assets is non-empty is
relaxed then we obtain the following related result:

Theorem 5: If a riskiess asset exists then all risky assets admit
consistent simple sum aggregation and the unique consistent rate
of return index for this aggregate is given by:

(14)

=

which is, incidentally, induced by the minimum variance portfolio
consisting of risky assets)6

This result is essentially equivalent to the well known separation theorem

of mean-variance analysis when a riskless asset exists. However, unlike
Theorem 5, the standard separation result does not instruct us how to construct or interpret a consistent rate of return index for the risky assets.

V. Summary
Above we have set forth conditions on the probability distribution
of rates of return which justify simple sum aggregation over sets of assets.

-13-

These conditions tend to be rather stringent: a group of assets admit
consistent simple sum aggregation if their rates of return are perfectly
correlated or, in a continuous-time trading environment, if the covariances between the rates of return of assets inside and outside the group

assume a specific structure. In this latter case we have demonstrated
that perfect substitutability between assets is not a necessary condition

for simple sum aggregation to be consistent. We have also described the
construction of consistent rate of return indices when a simple sum aggregation scheme is consistent.

The validity of this formulation of the investor choice problem
does not require r and 1 to be constant over time. Both parameters
may, in fact, be generated by their own diffusion processes provided that the forecast errors in predicting instantaneous changes
in r are uncorrelated with instantaneous forecast errors associated with
predicting actual rates of return. See section 5 of Merton (1973).

Notice that the following aggregation theorem is symmetric in
terms of the first and second asset groups. Hence, if the first
group admits consistent aggregation then so too does the second
group.

10.

An intuitive explanation of Theorem 3 is as follows. From the theory
of consumer choice, a group of commodities admit consistent aggregation if and only if the utility function is groupwise separable.
Similarly, in terms of problem (6) consistent aggregation obtains
if and only if the expected utility function hT —(p12) hTTh is
separable in terms of h1 and h2. It is shown in the appendix that
l2 takes the
this type of separability obtains if and only
form given in (9).

It is interesting, and important, to note that the portfolio1share
vector which induces the rate of return index
,g1=(l/iTG i)G111,
does not correspond to the optimal allocation ot relative shares
among assets of the first group. That is, the opimal allocation
of funds among assets of the first group is not W1 •g1 where W1
is the optimal allocation of funds to the first group as a whole.
Rather, the optimal relative share vector for the first group is
readily shown to be:

This result is proven in the appendix.

13.

Notice that this restriction, unlike that in Theorem 3, is not
symmetric with respect to the first and second groups of assets.
Thus, if a riskless asset exists, even if the first group of
assets admit consistent aggregation the second group may not.

14.

It follows from (12), then, that if the second group of assets
contains only one asset then the first group admits consistent
aggregation.

15.

The portfolio share vector which induces

of assets from the first group.

optimal share vector of risky assets obtained by solving the

Proof of Theorem 1:

Step 1: Let us rewrite the portfolio choice problem as

(Al)

maximize E(U[(Ad) R1 + AR21)

subject to:

< W; l' 2

where the first group of assets are those to be aggregated.

Step 2: Let da be the largest element of the vector d and let "j" be
the corresponding position index. It is clear that if a limited liability
asset exists then investors will invest a positive amount in the Itjtt asset

of the first group and nothing in the remaining elements of the group,
Hence, if a1 is the amount invested in the jth asset then (Al) is equivalent
to the problem

Therefore, the first group of assets admit consistent simple sum aggregation

Step 2: Problem (A3) may be rewritten in the equivalent form:
(A4)

maximize E[U(cL1 (aT1) + A2T2])

a1, 2
subject to: a + 1TA < W
where a 1T1 Visual inspection of (A3) and (A4) reveals that the optimal
values of A2 in both problems are identical. Hence, simple sum aggregation
over the first group of assets is consistent and the rate of return index

for this group is 4 £TR

Proof of Theorem 3:

But problem (A35) is equivalent to optimizing over the holdings of 2 and
a single risky asset with rate of return

(A36)

where

=

(]•TG_L)/(1TG_li)

is clearly linear homogeneous in i. Hence, we conclude that if

condition (A29) obtains then the first group of assets may be aggregated
with the associated rate of return index given in (A36).

Suppose that the investor has only two assets in which to invest.
