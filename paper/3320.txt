PREDICTING EXCHANGE RATE CRISES:

MEXICO REVISITED

ABSTRACT

paper predicts ex—ante the probability of currency crises end size of
expected devaluations month by month for Mexico between 1980 and 1986
using a heterodox linear discrete time model of exchange rate crises. The
forces contributing to speculative attacks on the Mexican peso include internal
money creation, external credit shocks, and relative price shocks. The
framework proves highly successful for generating forecasts of the probability
of speculative attacks on the peso and for predicting lower bounds for post—
collapse exchange rates using a range of assumptions about critical levels of
central bank reserve floors. Simulation results suggest that reducing domestic
credit growth, increasing the uocertainty surrounding this growth, and reducing
the size and perhaps increasing the frequency of currency realignments might
have greatly reduced the amount of currency speculation against the peso in
some of the crisis periods between 1980 and 1986.

In this paper a

a collapsing exchange regime is applied to the experiences of

Mexico, 1980 to 1986. The model is used to assess the probability that the existing
controlled exchange rate will be collapsed by a speculative attack on central bank foreign
exchange reserves. It also is used to generate forecasts of lower bounds for sustainable
post—collapse exchange rates.

An exchange rate crisis can take the form of either

the timing and probability of speculative attacks and forecast lower bounds for the postcollapse exchange rates.

The potential of this line of research has already been demonstrated. For
exacople, van Wijnbergen (1987) shows that the sustainability of the move from a
fiexibie to a fixed exchange rate as undertaken in Brazil, Israel and Argentina with the

iotent

of

controlling runaway inflation can be severeiy limited by the pursuit of

inconeistent monetary and fiscal policies. Blanco and Garber' s (1986) application of a
coliaoee model to the Mexican experience [1973 to 1982 illustrated the predictive
potential of these models concluding that "devaluations, both in and out of sample, did
occur when

the conditional

exchange rate eet by the central

hank's

policy rule exceeded

the fixed exchange rate... Furthermore, the expected exchange rates conditional on
devaluation are close to the values that actually materialized in the major episodes."
Gumby and van Wijnhergen's (1988) application of a similar model
experience of Argentina [1979 and 1981[ led them

to the crawling peg

to conclude that the domestic credit

growth strategy pursued by the Argentine government nearly conp1eteiy undermined the

announced crawling exchange rates.
While these studies provide evidence for the qualitative and intuitive success of

applying these linear discrete time models, the results can

be improved

upon and

broadened in a number of dimensions. Restrictive assumptions prevailing in previous
studies include strict purchasing—power—parity (PPP), interest rate parity, and the
unresponsiveness of the demand for real balances to currency substitution motives. In
addition, a richer specification of the forces contributing to crises can he modelled. While

domestic credit shocks are still expected to be the dominant force in triggering

this paper to also track the

significance of external credit shocks and relative

price shocks. It is shown that the relative price shocks played an important in role in

the dynamics of the peso crises This is not the case for external credit shocks in the
1980s.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the
extended collapse model. Section

II provides a summary of the currency history for

Mexico in the 1980s. Section III presents the procedures used for data analysis and
describes the iterative estimation procedure used for generating month—by—month
predictions of post—collapse exchange rates and collapse probabilities for Mexico. Section
IV provides out—of—sample estimates of predicted shadow exchange rates and collapse
probabilities under

a range of assumptions, including structural breaks

in money demand

behavior. Out—of—sample forecasts are compared with those generated by Blanco and
Garber for a subperiod of our study. Section V analyzes the forces contributing to
Mexico's crises and provides simulations of crises under different patterns of shocks to
the Mexican economy. Section VI concludes.
1. The Extended Collapse Model

The discrete—time model relies on a money market equilibrium condition which
determines either the equilibrium exchange rate under a flexible exchange system or the
endogenous path of central bank reserves under a controlled rate system? The demand
for real money balances is elastic with respect to nominal interest rates

[ij, domestic

real income [yj, and the desire to substitute domestic currency for foreign currency when
there

is

some expectation of a change in the nominal exchange rate, St.

Results are discussed in depth in Goldberg (1988).

difficulties for the central bank arise when this depletion of foreign exchange reserves is

the outcome of fundamental disequilibrium (systematic overvaluation) rather than
transitory events. The resulting systematic decline of reserves may lead economic agents

to doubt the ability of the central bank to sustain the controlled rate. Agents may
initiate speculative attacks on the currency which can fulfil their own expectations by
collapsing the exchange rate lObstfeld (1986)1.

The ahadow exchange rate, S÷1, defines the exchange rate that would
equilibrate the money market in t+1 if a speculative attack were to drive reserves to
their minimal level and force the collapse of the controlled exchange rate. Under
domestic currency convertibility, if agents are cumulatively powerful enough to deplete
existing stock of central bank foreign exchange reserves, speculators will attack reserves

The events surrounding the Mexican crises of the 1980s are by now familiar. Following a long
period of exchange stability and conservative monetary policy,

10 percent per month[ was announced along with

a promise of no major sharp

adjustments. Soon afterwards, currency speculation rose, capital flight increased, and vast
amounts of money were shifted into investments and real estate in the United States. In early
1982 new credit flows

Mexico levelled, marking

the end

of the rapid expansion of private

and official commitments Mexico. The Mexican government was able to defend the exchange

rate until February 1982 when the government withdrew support of the peso in foreign

Mexico fell by approximately 40 percent.9

Triggered by the onset of the Mexican debt crisis, in August 1982 the government
again succumbed to market speculation and withdrew support for the peso. The collapse led
to a temporary closing of all foreign exchange markets and the implementation of a two tier
exchange system.

The two tier system was replaced by a crawling peg in September 1983. The crawl
provided for daily peso depreciations at a rate

of

13

centavos to the dollar. In December 1984

the slippage rate was increased to 17 centavos per dollar per day. In March 1985 the slippage
rate increased once again, this time to 21 ceotavos per day. This crawl remained until July

the government devalued the controlled rate by 16.7 perceot, before abandonniog
the crawling rate altogether in August 1985 in favor of a controlled float. The controlled float

was intended to provide for daily adjustments of the exchange rate to compensate for the
inflation differential between the United States and Mexico. In practice, the exchange regime
was similar to the crawling peg which preceded it.
Based on this credit and currency history, the collapse model for fixed or crawling

rate systems is most appropriately applied to the

1980 to 1986 period for Mexico. Although

Mexico's externally credit constrained interval begins in 1980 and the tightly controlled
exchange regime formally ends in August 1985, results are generated for various subperiods of
the full sample. The results for 1980:12 through 1982:9 overlap with the interval studied by

This method of decomposition presents an interesting bias to the estimation results.

If the correlation between foreign credit contractions and domestic expansions is

positive, the

random behavior of domestic monetary authorities is biased downward. Since the positive
correlation is extremely likely, this implies an implicit upward bias on the role of external
credit shocks in Mexico's currency crises. Alternatively stated, this approach may understate
the role of domestic monetary authorities since

the results still suggest the overwhelming importance of uncertainty attributable to domestic

The scale of domestic credit uncertainty surrounding domestic credit policies of

monetary authorities grew fairly steadily between 1980 and

1987,

Marked increases in

uncertainty levels are evident in early 1982, prior to the poignant currency and debt crises of
the 1982/1983 period, and in early 1985 prior to the abandonment of the crawling psg
regime. Uncertainty surrounding external credit flows was fairly stable

at low levels through

June of 1982. At the time of the debt crisis and the temporary closing of Mexico's foreign
exchange market in August 1982, uncertainty surrounding foreign credit flows substantially

rose and remained at new high levels through early

1984. A

substantial rise in the

uncertainty surrounding external credit flows to Mexico occured throughout the remainder of
1984 and peaked1° in February 1986.

A highly controlled float was

in effect

at that point.

15The peak described is local since the uncertainty surrounding external credit flows
declined sharply in 1986 and' early 1987 before reaching new highs in mid 1987 and 1988.

a range

of assumptions over

parameter stability within

intervals and a range of reserve floors. While the full sample of data spans 1980:12 to

independent of the choice of start up value for a3.
151n practice, the system generally is estimated for up to 15 passes through the data.
Although the parameter estimates converged to stable values in most runs, it is unknown
whether the final values represented local or global maxima. Other estimation issues arise
because the generated first pass estimates of a3, a1 and a2 are subject to omitted
variables bias to the extent that the expected change in the exchange rate is correlated
with the interest rate and income. This bias reduces to a function of the covariance of
nominal domestic credit with nominal interest rates and real income respectively. While
the convergence results suggest that this omitted variables bias disappears, it is unclear if
there is any residual effect on final parameter estimates.

Below, results are presented for the pre—1983:10 and post 1983:9 periods.

The break point is the time of implementation of the crawling peg regime. In the early
interval, money demand shows

a positive and significant income elasticity of demand,

as

expected. The interest sensitivity and currency substitution motives for money demand
holdings are both positive and significant in this early period, with the sign reversal
contrary to expectations. In the post 1983:9 interval, the elasticity of money demand to the
interest rate was the only significant term in the money- demand equation.
For the early interval, the higher the reserve floor the higher the prediction of a
currency collapse. The one—period—ahead collapse probability predictions are shown in
Figure 5 for the range of reserve floors

withstand speculation. While skepticism remained high for many types of agents, using
reserve floors to approximate type, the shadow exchange rate results suggest that the scale

of devaluation was underpredicted by even the high reserve floor model. This steep
devaluation convinced the low reserve floor agents of the short term sustainability of the
peso, but the high floor agents were less sanguine- By April 1982, expansionary monetary
policies undermined the restored confidence in the peso leading low reserve floor agents to

predict an additional 4 percent devaluation and the high reserve floor agents to predict an
additional 16 percent devaluation. Central bank foreign exchange reserves began to fall
dramatically, although they were not instantaneously depleted. The shadow rate results
suggest that the predicted devaluation rose steadily though the course of the speculative
attack on central bank reserves in the months which followed, The devaluation predictions

meaningless because of the structural instability and generally are uninformative for the

latter half of the sample. Therefore, below the probability of collapse figures represent
probabilities generated for the 1983:10 to 1986:12 under the assumption that the parameters
estimated for the early interval were still valid for the latter interval.

The results suggest that the rate of crawl for the peso was inadequate at least
through August 1984. The significant increase in uncertainty surrounding money creation
appears to have dominated the ir, jump ohserved in December 1983. The subsequent
contraction of domestic credit in January 1984 lowered collapse expectations but generally
failed to restore faith in the sustainability of the existing crawl.

The sharp rise in domestic credit creation forecasts and the high levels of
surrounding uncertainty contributed to the April 1984 predictions of a more steeply
devalued peso. As foreign exchange reserves fell sharply in that period, some measure of
confidence in the peso crawl was restored by the monetary authorities pulling in on the
reigns of domestic credit. A full scale speculative attack appears to have been averted. For
the remainder of 1984, the peso followed a rate of crawl which, according to the collapse
estimates, was sufficient to minimize currency speculation. The increase in the rate of crawl
in December 1984 was associated with an interval of peso strength in the sense of
accumulating foreign exchange reserves. The increase in uncertainty surrounding external
credit flows appreared to have little effect on shifting

ir to critically

high levels. Moreover,

the model predicts that collapse probabilities remained close to zero for the remainder of
the sample. This could suggest that confidence in the peso was restored by the successful
application of the crawl and the controlled float that followed. However, these resolts could
also reflect a problem with the application of

the collapse model to this latter interval.

1981:6 thrnugh 1983:9 interval. If the variability of internally generated shocks were halved,

currency speculation (if positively related to

ir1)

is predicted to have been even higher in

the periods preceding the February 1982 realignment and in early 1983. The model suggests
that doubling the uncertainty surrounding internal credit growth could have reduced the
probability of the bollapse by as much as 50 percent prior to February 1982 and could
have significantly reduced speculation in the months which followed.

Decreasing the variability of external credit shocks, on the other hand, would
have reduced the probability
1/A21 to one thousandth of

of collapse, but not by very large amounts. A reduction of
its level generally reduced ir by less than 5 percent in each

period. This is a strong result. It suggests that external credit shocks contributed very little

crises

of

Mexico in the 1980s. This result is strengthened further

—19—

if

une

considers

that the construction of 1/Afl tended to overstate rather than understate its

importance.

The role of relative price shocks in the onset of crises varies over time.
Decreasing the variability of relative prices uniformly reduced the probability of collapse.
The significance of this effect dramatically changed prior to and following the February
1982 realignment, when 1/we rose sharply.

Pre- February

1982, reducing relative price

uncertainty would have had little effect on currency speculation. Following this period,
however, 1/we contributed greatly to speculation since, according to

the model, agents

were

reluctant to take another sharp reduction in the purchasing power of their holdings. This
force becomes even stronger as

rises. While the model predicts that reducing 1/w, sharply in the periods following the

realignment would have dramatically cut the speculation through July

1982, following

These simulation results are difficult to interpret since 1/wv

a function of past

VI. Concluding Remarks

This application of a speculative attack model to Mexico's experiences in the

1980s

suggests that domestic monetary arid fiscal policy rather than external credit shocks were
the driving forces in triggering speculative attacks on the Mexican peso in the 1980s. The
model successfully predicted the realignments

generated probabilities of speculative attacks

of the

peso which occured in this period, and

that were

conditioned on the assumed lower

limit on central hank foreign exchange reserve holdings. The simulation results suggest that
reducing domestic credit growth, increasing the uncertainty surrounding this growth, and
reducing the size and perhaps increasing the frequency of currency realignments may have
greatly reduced the amount of currency speculation against the peso in some of the crisis
periods between 1980 and 1986.

The results also suggest that more attention be focussed on the importance of
heterogeneous agents for the timing and magnitude of speculative attacks on a currency.
Specifically,

it is

shown

that

by varying the assumed critical reserve floor, the predicted

rate and collapse probabilities also greatly change. While the crisis literature
generally models balance of payments crises using a representative agent framework, these
shadow

results suggest

that

if different agents are endowed with different perceptions

about central

bank access to hquidity, they may be triggered to speculate against the peso
points in time.
