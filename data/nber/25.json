    "abstract": "\n\nThe fine structure of earnings is defined by a theoretically meaningful decomposition of the covariance matrix of earnings (or log earnings) time series.  A three-element variance components model is proposed for analyzing earnings of young workers.  These components are interpreted as the effects of differential on-the-job training (OJT) and differential economic ability.  Several properties of these components and relationships between them are deduced from the OJT model.  Background noise generated by a nonstationary first-order autoregressive process, with heteroscedastic innovations and time-varying AR parameters is also assumed present in observed earnings.  ML estimates are obtained for all parameters of the model for a sample of Swedish males.  The results are consistent with the view that the OJT mechanism is an empirically significant phenomenon in determining individual earnings profiles.\n\n",
