BRiTISH UNIONS IN DECLINE: AN
EXAMINATION OF ThE 1980S FALL
IN TRADE UNION RECOGNI11ON

ABSTRAa
The authors analyze establishment-level data from the three Workplace Industrial
Relations Surveys of 1980, 1984 and 1990 to document and explain the sharp decline in
unionization that occurred in Britain over the 1980s. Between 1980 and 1990 the proportion of

British establishments which recognised manual or non-manual trade unions for collective
bargaining over pay and conditions fell by almost 20 percent (from 0.67 to 0.54). The evidence
reported demonstrates the importance of the interaction between the labour market, the product
market, employer behaviour and the legislative framework in detemiining union recognition status

in new establishments. The sharp fall in trade union recognition appears to be largely driven by
a failure to achieve recognition status in establishments set up in the 1980s. These results, when

taken in conjunction with recent changes in the nature of employment in the British labour

market, seem to paint a bleak picture for unions and there appears to be no reason why the
decline in union activity should not continue into the 1990s.

I. Introduction
Declining unionization has been one of the most significant features of the British
labour market in the 1980s. All conventional measures of union presence and power vividly
demonstrate this. The proportion of British establishments which recognised manual or non-

manual trade unions for collective bargaining over pay and conditions fell by almost 20
percent (from 0.67 to 0.54) between 1980 and 1990 (Millward et al., 1992); the proportion

of workers covered by a collective agreement fell from 0.71 in 1984 to 0.54 in 1990
(Millward et aL, 1992); aggregate union membership fell from 13.2 million in 1980 to 9.9
million by 1990; the corresponding fall in aggregate union density was from 54 percent to

38 percent (and it has continued to fall post-1990). The longer time series profile of
aggregate union density (defined as the number of union members divided by the total
worlcforce), pictured in Figure 1, shows that declines in the 1980s have completely reversed

the gains achieved in the 1970s. Union density now stands at its lowest level for 30 years.

A recent survey of trends in union activity in the British labour market is provided

in Mason and Bain (1993).' They evaluate and appraise the (relatively large) literature
which has attempted to explain longer term trends in unionisation and the smaller body of

evidence that has analysed the sharp decline of the 1980s. There are few British studies,
however, that analyse microeconomic data on workplaces or individuals at different points
in time and most concentrate on union membership density as the variable to be explained.

In this paper we use microeconomic establishment-level data from the three
Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys2 to document and explain the sharp 1980s decline

in union activity. We differ from the studies referred to above (notably Beaumont and
Harris, 1993) in that we focus on establishment-level recognition of trade unions for the
1

purposes of determining pay and conditions of employment as our measure of unionization.
Beaumont and Harris, fi,r example, use the panel element of the 1984 and 1990 surveys to

focus on within-establishment declines in union density which they argue drives changes in
union recognition. On the contrary we study the wider, nationally representative samples of

workplaces in the three cross-sections (the sample of establishments in the panel is much
more restricted: for example, by definition the panel excludes all those workplaces under

6 years old and it looks only at trading sector establishments). In addition, we view the
extent of recognition, rather than union membership or density, as the key determinant of the

effects of unions on economic outcomes? For example, in an earlier piece (Disney, Gosling

and Machin, 1993a; secalso Gregg and Naylor, 1990) the variation in union density across
establishments was itself shown to be principally driven by the extent of union recognition.
Our empirical analysis attempts to weigh up the relative importance of compositional

changes versus within-group changes in unionism, to develop an econometric model of the

detennination of union recognition status and, lastly, to discover whether the observed
changes are temporary or cyclical (whereby they may be reversed in the future) or if they

reflect a more permanent trend. Whether any particular explanation of the union decline
dominates is extremely important, both for trade unions and employers, and has implications

for the overall functioning of the labour market. It is well established that unions affect a

range of economic outcome? (wages, employment, productivity, profits) and that wage,
employment and profit determination is different in unionized and non-unionized labour
markets. Hence, whether or not companies have trade unions in their workplace is important

for their corporate performance. Unions also affect other outcomes. The 1 980s has seen a

significant rise in wage inequality (see Gregg and Machin, 1993) and unions have
2

traditionally been seen as a force for pay equality) If the observed union decline is not
secular and reflects a long-term trend than we would presumably, in the absence of other

offsetting effects, see continued growth in the inequality of the pay received by different
workers. It is therefore important to evaluate the reasons for union decline and to stress that

the l980s decline in unionization is interesting not only for its own sake but also for what
it implies about the nature of and reward for work in the future.

if. What Hannened to Union Recoenition in Britain Between 1980 and 1990?

The Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys
The three Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys of 1980, 1984 and 1990 are the

most widely-used and commonly cited surveys on industrial relations in British
establishments. The surveys are nationally representative surveys of establishments that

employ at least 25 workers (the sampling frame is based on the Census of Employment dated

three years before each survey).' In recent years, the data have been quite heavily used by
both labour economists and industrial relations researchers to examine a variety of issues.'

Establlsbment-Level Unionization, 1980-90
Table I uses the establishment-level data from the surveys to document the decline of
union recognition for both manual and non-manual workers across all establishments and in

different sectors of the economy (the public sector, private sector manufacturing and nonmanuficturing). Between 1980 and 1990 the proportion of establishments which recognised

trade unions for manual workers fell by around 13 percentage points or 21 percentof the
3

1980 mean (from 0.61 to 0.48); non-manual recognition fell by about 7 percentage points

or 15 percent (from 0.50 to 0.43). Declines in the proportion of establishments with
recognised unions are observed between 1980 and 1990 for all the disaggregated groups

reported in the Table for both manuals and non-manuals. The sharpest declines have
appeared within the areas where unions have been traditionally strong, namely manual
workers in manufacturing (the decline there is a massive 25 percentage points fall or 34
percent compared to the 1980 mean).
Table U reports the same exercise for establishment-level union density between 1980
and 1990 and for union coverage between 1984 and 1990 (data on coverage was not available

in the first survey). The pattern looks very similar to that traced out by the recognition
variables in Table 1. There are some differences (e.g. the 1984-90 fall in coverage in the
public sector suggests a sharper decline, which is largely due to the removal of collective
bargaining machinery for teachers and nurses), but the Table demonstrates the main trends

depicted in Table I, namely that falls in unionization have been very marked, and more
marked in private sector manufacturing, the traditional stronghold of private sector unionism.

Decomposition of Changes in Union Recognition Status
It is well known that changes in the composition of employment have simultaneously

occurred as the 1980s saw large shifts away from manufacturing to services, away from

manual to non-manual employment, from full-lime to part-time work, male to female
employment and so on. As such the changing nature of employment has involved a shift

towards those areas where unions have traditionally been less well represented (see, for
example, Green, 1992).

4

The relative importance of declines within the three groups in Table I venus declines

arising from compositional changes can be easily evaluated. One can decompose the
aggregate change in the proportion of establishments with recognised unions, say AX, in the

following manner

Ax =
where

AxJ

+ Ax2?2 +

a bar denotes a 1980-1990

AxJ

mean,

+

+

X is the proportion of establishments with

recognised unions amongst the establishments in group i and f4 is the relative frequency of

group i among all establishments. The first three terms relate to within-group changes and
the last two terms reflect compositional (or between group) shifts. The results are shown in

Table m and pictured in Figure II. Half of the decline in manual recognition is explained
by the decline inside the manufacturing sector. For manual workers compositional changes

between these three broad sectors explain less than 15 percent of the total 1980 to 1990
change. For non-manual workers both the decline within the public sector and the declining

share of public sector employment in total employment are important, but no single effect
dominates.

Simple Logit Models of Union Recognition Status
The nature of the decomposition results are further drawn out by the simple logit

models of union recognition that we report in Tables Wa and IVb. These are purely
descriptive econometric models which attempt to disentangle the relative importance of
potential determinants of union status. In addition to the sectoral classifications used in the

decomposition, we treat recognition as a function of establishment size and workforce

5

characteristics since they are likely to determine the expected costs and benefits of
unionization (e.g. if unions give workers access to collective voice this will have more of an

effect in larger establishments where there is a greater need for more formal channels of

communication). Furthermore, there are important reasons as to why establishment age
affects union status relating to life cycle, attrition and changing circumstances at set up date.

These are discussed in more detail below. We thus include a dummy variable indicating
whether the establishment is over 25 years old (20 in 1990)
Several important results emerge from consideration of the regressions in Table IV.

Pint, the cross sectional decline in union recognition between 1980 and 1990 is not fully
explained by the estimated models. In the pooled sample for both manuals and non-manuals

the estimated coefficients on the 1980 and 1984 sample dummies are large, statistically
significant and positive indicating that the trend in unionization is not entirely explained by

the decline in the relative share of public sector establishments, manufacturing
establishments, and the other controls.
Secondly, in most specifications recognition appears to be determined differently in

private sector manufacturing than in private sector non-manufacturing and in the public as

compared to the private sector as the

parameter stability tests at the base of the Tables

show. For manual recognition, the estimated coefficient on the dummy variables indicating
private manufacturing status shows a sharp decline from 0.814 (marginal effect = 0.143) to

0.259 (marginal effect = 0.056) between 1980 and 1990 reinforcing the result that there have
been large declines within manufacturing that are not explained by the independent variables

included in the logit models.'

The third result of note is that establishment age is found to be an extremely
6

important determinant of recognition in all years (for manuals) and its effect is clearly
increasing over time (for both groups of workers). One should be a little careful here since
the definition of the age variable differs across years9 but, even given this, there does appear

to be an important shift. For example, in the manual specifications in Table Wa, the
marginal effect associated with the coefficient on age more than doubles, rising from 0.07

in 1980 to 0.18 in 1990.'° Hence, between 1980 and 1990 there is a large ceteris paribus
increase in the probability that unions are recognised in older establishments.

ifi. The Imnortance of the Establishment Aae Effect

Modelling Procedure
Establishment age will be a determinant of the probability of recognition if there is
some inertia in the determination of union status or if older establishments are consistently

different from newer ones. It will also be important as a time related variable if, for one
reason or another, the organising ability of unions or the ability of employers to resist unions

shifts over time.
Existing evidence suggests that recognition is usually a once and for all decision made

at some point early in the lifetime of the establishment. Recognition changes in existing

establishments have remained uncommon even in the 1980s. Evidence suggests that
derecognifions were almost unheard of up to about 1984, but some derecognitions occurred

in the mid-to-late 1980s (see Claydon, 1989)." In the 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations

Survey managers of non-union workplaces were asked if they had a recognised union in
1984: only 2 percent of the private sector sample stated that they had. Beaumont and Harris
7

(1993) examine the panel element of the 1984 and 1990 surveys (which covers 537 trading

sector establishments)and state that "the vast majority of establishments did not change their
union (non-union) status in the years 1984-90". Similarly, although the company-level

survey of Gregg and Yates (1991) reported a number of partial recognition changes (i.e.
derecognition for a single skill group in an establishment, or in a single establishment of a
multi-establishment company), they found very few cases of complete derecognition. Smith
and Morton (1993) confirm this and attribute it to the significant fixed costs associated with
changing the union status of establishments.

Accepting this once for all nature of the union recognition decision what are the
reasons for variations in recognition over time? Three broad mechanisms through which
establishment age can affect union recognition status suggest themselves:

(i) Life cycle effects: If at any point in lime the probability that a non-union establishment
starts to recognise a union is greater than zero and recognition is a once and for all decision

then the cumulative probability of recognition must be higher in older establishments. A
greater share of newer establishments in the total stock of establishments in the 1980s would

therefore predict lower union recognition.

(ii) Attrition effects: if there are unobservable factors that both determine the expected
lifetime of a workplace and unionization and/or the expected life span of an establishment

is determined by union status then these will be picked up by the coefficient on age. One
example is that "unions kill firms" via their rent-seeking activities (Freeman and Kleiner,
1993); this is discussed in more detail later.

(iii) Time varying covariates: it is not the age of the establishment per se that matters for

recognition, but the prevailing conditions in the economy and the industry when the
8

establishment was set up that affect the likelihood of union recognition. Thus an
establishment set up in the 1960s is more likely to recognise a union than one set up in the

1980s not because it is 20 years older but because the conditions in the 1960s were more
favourable to unionization than in the 1980s.
The expected future path of unionization depends crucially on which of these factors
is dominant. Under the first two mechanisms the level of unionization is literally detennined

by the age structure of establishments. If the last mechanism is of most importance, then
given the nature of the legislative and macroeconomic climate and trends in the changing
nature of employment (all of which seem set to continue into the 1990s), new establishments

will be much less likely to become unionized and the observed decline in recognition can be

expected to continue into the 1990s.

Analysis of the three Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys suggests that time
varying covariates are a potentially important determinant of the relationship between union

status and establishment age. Firstly, the actual question in the surveys from which the age
variable is constructed concerns the age of the workplace at its current address (see footnote

9 where the question is reproduced): thus it includes establishments that have moved (to
larger premises, for example). In the 1990 survey questions were asked to determine which
establishments were not in fact new establishments but were movers and among these movers

whether the move took place with the workforce intact and so on. The relationship between
union recognition and age is not significantly different between these three groups. Thus

while moving may enable management to re-evaluate its industrial relations strategy (as in
the case of Wapping for the newspaper industry) there appears to be no mechanism by which

it should change the expected life path of the establishment: this would be necessary if the

9

first two effects discussed above were dominant.

The second reason for the claim that what matters is the date that the establishment

was set-up rather than its age is demonstrated below. In the 1990 survey the question on
establishment age was continuous (up to 20 years old) and thus we know the exact year in
which the workplace was 'born'. If attrition or life cycle effects were dominant we would

expect a smooth (if not linear) mean relationship between age and recognition. This is

simply not the case. The age dated paths of avenge recognition proportions plotted in
Figure m mirror the aggregate union density series in Figure I but, the overall downward
trend apart, do not display a smooth relationship.
Our final reason is the statistical importance of age of establishment dated regressors

in econometric models of the determinants of recognition status and we turn to this next.
Rather than just including age in a recognition equation we next evaluate the importance of

various variables dated to the time of establishment set up. This is clearly an attractive
procedure since it gives us information on what determines union status in the first instance

and draws out the historical aspect of the recognition decision.

Model Specification
What time-specific factors are likely to affect the probability of recognition? Three

groups of time-varying factors (which need not necessarily be mutually exclusive) can be
separated:

(i) Economic factors: union status can be seen to be the outcome of a bargain, implicit or
explicit, between management and unions at or around the time at which the establishment

was set up. Product market structure at the time of the bargain will influence the relative
10

costs and benefits to management and unions of achieving or resisting unionization and thus

condition the level of resources they will be prepared to sacrifice to achieve the desired
outcome (see Abowd and Father, 1990, or Disney et aX., 1992, for an extended discussion
of these issues). It is also likely that there are factors which determine the balance of power

in the labour market and the probability of new recognitions. One obvious labour market

structure variable reflecting this is the extent of unionization among comparable
establishments.

We utilise two variables in our empirical work to model product and labour market
structure at establishment set up date. We model the product market by including industrylevel profits per head (qUasi-rents per worker)'2 at the date of set up (as in our earlier paper

based only on private sector manufacturing, see Disney et al., 1992, l993b). This proxies
the expected rents over which the employer and union can bargain and hence the expected
gain (loss) of unionization. The relationship is expected to be non-linear (see Disney et a!.
1992). Unfortunately data on this variable is not available for non-manufacturing or for the

public sector. Our labour market structure variable, industry union density at set up date,
is however available for all three sectors.
(ii) Legislative factors: the Conservative government elected in 1979 introduced a range of

anti-union legislative measures. Whilst it is hard to ascribe an effect to legislation on the
basis of time effects (though this is exactly what Freeman and Pelletier, 1990, do) we can

attempt to evaluate this route by considering whether or not a post-1979 shift in the
probability of recognition occurred. Specifically, we incorporate a dummy variable equal
to one if the establishment was set up after 1979 in our logit regressions of the determinants

of recognition.'3
11

(iii) Macroeconomic factors: a lot of earlier labour economics and industrial relations work
has emphasised the role of the business cycle in shaping union status. We experiment with

several macroeconomic indicators at the date of set up: specifically we allow potential roles

for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation.

Estimates of Establishment-Level Union Recognition Equations
Table V examines the importance of these time-dated variables in affecting manual

union recognition. It is not surprising, given the time series profile of establishment age
dated recognition illustrated in Figure ifi, that the variable indicating whether or not the
establishment was set up in the 1980s proves extremely important. Establishments that were

set up in the eighties are significantly less likely to recognise trade unions. As noted above
it is hard to reconcile this with the life-cycle and attrition explanations of the importance of

establishment age. Hence, much of the focus in Table V is on the importance of this 80s
effect in conjunction with the other time-dated variables.

Three specifications are reported in Table V for each sector. The first is a simple
logit regression of manual union recognition on the "Established in the 1980? variable; the

second includes the age-dated economic factors relating to labour and product market
structure; the third includes those macroeconomic factors found to be important over and
above the other effects. In the private manufacturing and non-manufacturing equations the
1980s effect is strongly negative and statistically significant. The magnitude of the effect is
sizable: private sector manufacturing establishments set up in the 1 980s were ceteris pan bus

some 30 percent less likely to recognise manual unions than other private sector
manufacturing establishments (column (2));
12

within non-manufacturing the analogous

probability was about 18 percent (column (5)))4 This drives home the point made above
that much of the union decline is going on within sectors. Unions are finding it harder to
achieve recognition status both where they used to be strong (private sector manufacturing)

and in the newer sorts of establishments that are becoming increasingly more typical of the
British labour market (private sector non-manufacturing). On the strength of this, it is hard

to imagine this decline being arrested in the l990s.

In the private sector the other set up dated variables perform well. In manufacturing
the industry quasi-rents per head variables show the stable, quadratic relationship that we

have reported in earlier work (Disney et al., 1992, 1993b).'5

Similarly, industry

unionisation at lime of set up has.a strong positive impact on the likelihood of manual union
recognition. It is relatively hard to find any important role for macroeconomic factors: the
most marked effect over and above the other time-varying controls came from an aggregate
GDP growth variable, the coefficient on which only suggests a very weak pro-cyclical pattern

in the ability of unions to achieve recognition status in the private sector (other
macroeconomic variables were statistically insignificant as the Likelihood Ratio statistics at

the base of the Table demonstrate).

In the public sector it proves harder to isolate any important effects. This is (at least
partially) down to the ftct that, unlike the other sectors, unionised bargaining is still the
dominant mode of pay determination. The coefficient on the 80s variable is estimated to be

negative but insignificant and, if anything, the GDP growth variable suggests a countercyclical pattern. Overall, it appears (not surprisingly) that the time series pattern of public
sector recognition is driven by other factors. This seems plausible as the likes of competitive

tendering and subcontracting by non-union employers are probably more likely to be the
13

plincipal factors shaping the more modest fall in public sector unionism.

Evaluation of Results and Consideration of Alternative Hypotheses

The results point to an important fail in private sector union recognition that is
inherently linked to a failure to achieve recognition status in newer establishments. Several
factors could lie behind this. Those that have been emphasised as potential explanations of

union decline in the United States are: compositional changes; unfavourableshifts in public

opinion towards unions; increased management opposition; reduced demand for union

representation. There is some debate but the US work seems to rule out compositional
changes and increases in anti-union sentiments with the debate falling between those who
emphasise increased opposition of employers (Freeman, 1986; Freeman and Kleiner, 1990)
and falling demand (Farber and Krueger, 1993).

In the UK case it seems that one can also rule out the compositional changes
hypothesis for (at least) two reasons. Pint, the results in Table ifi suggest that betweensector shifts are relatively unimportant. Second, many of the compositional shifts that are

supposed to be bad for unions (e.g. increased female participation, moves towards an
increased share of non-manual workers and service sector employment) occurred in both the
1970s and the 1980s when unionization respectively increased and decreased.
The notion that attitudes towards unions became more unfavourable in the 1980s also

receives no support. The annual Gallup political opinion poll asks those surveyed the
following question:
GeMTCJIy speaking, do you think trade unions are a good thing or a bad thing?

Figure IV piots the responses to this question between the mid-1950s and 1990. In
14

the 1980s it is clear that the percentage of respondents stated that unions were perceived to

be a good thing increased through the decade.
What of the other explanations? Data limitations and the identification issue make it
impossible for us to address the hypothesis that the individual-level demand for unionism has

fallen. it is, however, possible to shed some light on the possibility of management
opposition by considering the following question asked to the managers of establishments that

do not have any union members in the 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey:

Wow would you describe management's general attitude towards trade union membership
among employees at rhLc establLchment. Is management....

in favour of trade union membership

not In favour of It

or neutral about it?
Table VI reports descriptive statistics on the responses to this question. It is clear that
managers are more likely have an unfavourable disposition towards unions in manufacturing

establishments where the proportion not in favour is 0.46 as compared to an average across

all establishments of 0.32. As the largest falls in union recognition were in manufacturing

this clearly points in the right direction (of course, we would also have liked to know
changes in managerial attitudes but, unfortunately, the question was only asked in the 1990
survey).
In Table VII we examine the hypothesis that unfavourable management attitudes were

more prevalent in those establishments set up in the 1980s. We do this by estimating a
simple logit model with a dependent variable coded 1 if management were not in favour of

unions and 0 otherwise. The 'Established in the 1980s variable is included as an
15

independent variable. We report separate specifications for private manufacturing and non-

manufacturing and report models which include the set of control variables used for the
recognition models in Table V.
In private-sector manufacturing establishments there is some evidence that managerial
attitudes.towards unions were less favourable in establishments that were set up in the 1980s.

Despite the small sample size, the estimated coefficient on "Established in the 1980s" is
estimated to be positive and significant (at the 10 percent level). The marginal effect in

column (1) suggests, ceteris paribus, that managers were some 23 percent more likely to

have an unfavourable view of unions in newly set-up establishments. Hence, increased
managerial opposition to unions seems important in the sector where the largest falls in

recognition status occurred. Effects are, however, insignificantly different from zero in
private services.

A final hypothesis, that "unions kill firms", because the cost increasing aspect of

union rent-seeking activity ultimately drives union firms out of business (Freeman and
Kleiner, 1993) can also briefly be examined since a sub-set of the 1984 survey establishments

were interviewed again to construct the panel element of the 1990 survey. A sample of the
trading sector establishments in the 1984 survey were re-sampled and the survey investigators

identified 87 plant closures (Millward et aL, 1992)." The proportion of these with manual

union recognition was .480, as compared to .491 for the population of trading sector
establishments; for non-manual recognition, comparable proportions were .291 for the
closures and .338 for the population. There is clearly no evidence here for the hypothesis

that the exit rate of establishments displays a positive correlation with union recognition

status. This is importint for our hypothesis that emphasises failure to organise new
16

establishments set up in the 1980s, as differences in exit rates would bias such a conclusion.

IV. Condudlzw Remarks
This paper documents and evaluates the reasons for the dramatic decline in union
presence observed in the British labour market through the 1980s. It focuses on trends in
union recognition drawing on data from the three Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys of

1980, 1984 and 1990. Our paper is rather different from earlier British work since we are

principally interested in changes over time, and because of the way in which we examine
time-specific effects. Some strong results emerge from the analysis. Much of the decline

has been due to falls within specific sectors. Hence the 1980s has seen big falls in union

presence both in sectors where they have traditionally been strong (private sector
manu6cturing) and where they have been relatively weak (private sector services). The
probability of union recognition is seen to depend importantly on the nature of the product
and labour market at the time in which an establishment is initially set up. As such it seems

that union recognition became significantly harder to achieve in new establishments in the

l98O199O time period and it is this, rather than derecognition of unions in existing
establishments, which has been driving the downturn in unionization. Within private sector

manufacturing, traditionally a stronghold of union activity, it appears that a 1980s increase
towards unfavourable managerial attitudes to trade unions can explain some of this fall.

The findings of this paper appear to paint a bleak picture for the future ability of
unions to organise new establishments, at least in the private sector (more in-depth analysis

of the public sector is certainly warranted, but beyond the scope of this paper). Given the
trends observed in the British labour market in the 1980s and the increased importance of
17

new, smaller establishments, we see no reason why the dramatic declines in union presence

of the 1980s should not continue into the 1990s.

Father and Krueger (1993) provide a recent empirical evaluation of US trends in
individual union membership and Riddell (1993) draws a contrast between the United
States and Canada.

The use of recognition as an indicator of union presence has been common in

empirical studies by labour economists using the Workplace Industrial Relations
Surveys: see the several papers on wages by Blanchflower and Oswald or Stewart
(examples are Blanchflower and Oswald, 1990, or Stewart, 1990) or the various
papers on the effects of unions on non-wage outcomes (Blanchflower et a!., 1991, or
Machin and Wadhwani, 1991, are two examples of these). It also has the virtue of
being exogenous in the sense that it is determined in an earlier time period, probably
at or around the date at which an establishment is set up: we elaborate much more
on the historical feature of the determination of recognition status below.

Gosling and Machin (1993) report evidence in line with this suggesting that wage

inequality would have risen by about 15-20% less than it did between 1980 and 1990
had the union structure of 1980 still prevailed in 1990.

6.

Of course, the 25 employee cut-off point excludes a sizable (considerably less
unionized) proportion of aggregate employment and this should be borne in mind
when interpreting the results reported in this paper.

7.

Miliward (1992) provides a summary of papers based on the surveys up to 1992.

8.

In logit models marginal effects are computed as $P(1-P) where P is the mean of the
dependent variable and fi is the relevant estimated coefficient.

Thepredsewordingofthe

eyquestionisas follows: in l98Oand 1984 "How

long ago did this establishment first engage in its main activity?"; in 1990 "How
long
has this establishment been operating here at this address?". The range of responses
also differs. In 1980 and 1984 responses were banded into 1-3 years, 3-5 years, 5-10

years, 10-25 years and 25 or more years. In 1990 responses were continuousup to
20 years and then open-ended as 20 or more years.

10.

For completeness, note that for non-manual recognition the comparable rise in the
marginal effect associated with age demonstrates an even sharper increase from 0.04
to 0.16.

11.

Also, some recent evidence (Geroski, Gregg and Desjonqueres, 1993) suggests that

this may have accelerated in the recession of the early 1990s, at least in the large
firms that they survey.

12. This variable was mapped in at 2-digit industry-level from the relevant Census of
Production and is defined as (sales - material costs - avenge wage) I number of
workers. Note that, for data matching reasons, capital costs are not deducted. We
did, however, experiment with netting out capital costs with little difference to the
results. These additional tests are discussed below.

13. Rather than simply use this "Established in the l980s" variable we also included a set

of dummy variables indicating the year of set-up in the 1980s (except for 1989 where
all new establishments did not have recognition). These results (available on request)
pointed to a negative effect in each year after 1979.

14 -

Despite the fact that one of the included controls is a single-site dummy variable it

is also possible that effects may be different in newly established single independent
establishments as compared to those that are part of a multi-establishment enterprise
(we thank a referee for this comment). Estimating separate equations comparable to
column (1) of Table V for single-site establishments and for establishments that
belong to a multi-plant organisation produced very similar marginal effects associated
with the "Established in the 1980s" variable. Hence, the failure to organise new
establishments seems to hold for new firms and for newly set up establishments in
existing firms.

15. As noted above (footnote 10) the quasi-rents variable does not net out capital costs.

Whilst we could not get a capital stock series to perfectly match the industry
classification of the quasi-rents variable, we did also construct a rents variable that

nets out capital costs, albeit at a slightly higher level of aggregation. Effects
remained much the same as in Table V when this variable was used: more
experiments of this kind are reported in Disney et a!. (1993).

16. We are extremely grateful to Neil Millward for providing us with the serial codes for
the 87 establishments who closed between 1984 and 1990.
