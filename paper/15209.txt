ABSTRACT
The future looked bright for Argentina in the early twentieth century. It had already achieved high
levels of income per capita and was moving away from authoritarian government towards a more open
democracy. Unfortunately, Argentina never finished the transition. The turning point occurred in the
1930s when to stay in power, the Conservatives in the Pampas resorted to electoral fraud, which neither
the legislative, executive, or judicial branches checked. The decade of unchecked electoral fraud led
to the support for Juan Peron and subsequently to political and economic instability.

I. Introduction
Institutions matter and are instrumental for achieving sustained economic growth. In this
paper we argue that beliefs, an informal norm, matter as much as the formal rule of law. In short
in many instances they are complements. Adherence to the rule of law, particularly within a
legitimate system of checks and balances is the exception rather than the norm for most countries.
The development of the rule of law entails solving a coordination problem in which the actors
refrain from acting in their short-run interests, particularly during crises.1 Here is where belief
systems can buttress the formal institutions from crumbling during times of crises. Either
authoritarian or democratic governments can establish adequate protection of property rights
under the rule of law so as to foster economic growth but the difference is in the legitimacy and
beliefs in the system. The conventional wisdom has been that longer run economic growth and
higher income per capita tends to induce a transition from autocratic regimes to democracy
(Lipset, 1959; North, 1995). More recently Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson and Yared (2008) have
argued that “critical historical junctures” are more important determinants than income for
whether a country makes a transition to democracy. 2 Those countries that managed to consolidate
democracy while weathering a crisis along the way added to the likelihood that they would stay
on the path of a legitimate system of checks and balances that maintains secure property rights.
Many scholars, e.g., North (1995) stress the importance for long-run economic growth on
restraining governments from becoming confiscatory. As Weingast (1997:261) notes: “…citizens
in stable democracies not only must value democracy but also must be willing to take costly
action to defend democratic institutions against potential violations.” In this paper we present a
case study of the erosion of the budding beliefs in checks and balances in Argentina, a country
that was in the top ten of GDP per capita countries in the early twentieth century and began a
long-run decline from the mid-20th century which continues today.3

1

We found Weingast (1997) particularly insightful for highlighting the difficulty in establishing the rule of
law.
2
The authors do not find a relationship between GDP/P and democracy once controlling for individual
country fixed effects. They argue that their evidence is consistent with countries having “critical historical
junctures” some of which lead to prosperity while others lead to relative poverty. We believe this to be the
case for Argentina and we place the critical juncture in the 1930s, which in turn led to the rise of Peron and
his populist policies.
3
From 1890 to 1950 Argentina ranked between 7th and 13th. From 1900 to 1948, Argentina had 15 years in
the top ten. These rankings are in GDP per capita in 1990 purchasing power parity. If we adjust by real
prices calculated in the Penn World Table 6, Argentina ranked 37th in 2000. Australia and Canada, to
whom Argentina is frequently compared, fared much better. Australia was in the top ten from 1890 to 1980
and reached its nadir at 14th in 1990. It now stands in 8th place. Canada started slower than Australia and
Argentina, not reaching the top ten until 1910. Except for the Great Depression, Canadians remained in the
top ten (Maddison, 1995 and own calculations, Penn World Table 6.0).

In many ways our article is the mirror image of the analyses started with North and
Weingast (1989) and followed by Stasavage (2003) and more recently by Bogart and Richardson
(2008). 4 In the North and Weingast analysis, the Glorious Revolution set in motion a system of
checks and balances while in our analysis the fraudulent elections in Argentina in the 1930s
eroded an emerging set of checks and balances and gave rise to “the tyranny of democracy.”5 The
lesson from our study for emerging democracies today is that adherence to a system of checks
and balances requires more than a constitution; it also requires the cultivation of a belief structure
in which both the elites and citizens refrain from short-run opportunistic behavior. More recently
North (2004) places particular emphasis on the importance of a belief structure to buttress the
formal institutions in a country.
In Argentina, beginning in the late 19th Century, there was a concerted push for electoral
reforms with success coming for the secret ballot in 1912 (Crawley 1984; Halperin Donghi 1995;
Pucciarelli 1983; Rock 1975 and Yablon 2003).6 We view the post 1914 to 1930 period as a
potential transition to a sustained democratic regime with open and reasonably honest elections,
along with an independent Supreme Court: in short Argentina was on the road to becoming a
legitimate democracy with checks and balances and high economic growth. The introduction of
open elections allowed the Radical party, a party with wide support from the middle class in the
cities and rural tenants, to control the presidency, and the lower house of Congress (Rock 1975).
We consider this a significant milestone on the way to legitimate democracy from the former
authoritarian conservative rule. In the next sixteen years with some bumps in the road, Argentina
maintained its high standard of living while it was in transition to an open democratic system with
a de jure and de facto independent court. Importantly, the formal institutions bolstered the beliefs
by the lower and middle class that they were part of the process of government.
Regrettably Argentina was unable to solidify the political transition to a democratic
regime with checks and balances. The ineptitude of the aging President Yrigoyen in the face of
the drop into the Great Depression led to a military coup, which restored the Conservatives to

The main distinction between North and Weingast (1989) and Stasavage (2003) is whether the rise of
Parliament following the Glorious Revolution was sufficient for establishing credible commitment.
Stasavage argues that it was the extended supremacy of the Whig Party. Bogart and Richardson argue that
legislation securing property rights increased over the 18th century in response to demand side forces. The
importance of these articles for our story is that checks and balances need to be created but then even more
importantly sustained over a relatively long period of time. Great Britain managed to do this while
Argentina fell by the wayside.

autocratic political environment in Argentina following 1862 see Saiegh (2008).

(2005). Of the South American countries, Argentina was the first to adopt the secret ballot, perhaps setting
the example which other countries followed.

power.7 From 1930 to 1940, Argentina departed from open legitimate elections. To stay in power
during the emergency period of the Great Depression the Conservatives resorted to electoral fraud
in key provinces. Despite receiving high marks for their economic policies during the Great
Depression, the electoral fraud perpetuated by the Conservatives along with the silence of the
Supreme Court eroded the nascent foundations of a political belief system which might have
brought about a true system of checks and balances. The Supreme Court openly approved the
military coup of 1930 and countenanced electoral fraud throughout most of the 1930s. 8 In short,
it was the confluence of the Great Depression, a military coup, electoral fraud, and the
countenance of electoral fraud by the Supreme Court and the Executive which paved the way for
the populist policies and institutional reforms of Juan Peron.9
Once elected, the Peronists impeached four of its five Supreme Court justices on the
grounds of their behavior in the 1930s as well as the thwarting of the “populist will.” From Peron
and continuing today, the result has been political and economic instability.10 Stop and go policies
characterized the post-Peron years. Prados de la Escosura and Sanz-Villarroya (2004) most
convincing tie instability in property rights to the relative decline in Argentine long run economic
growth. They point to the late 1940s as the turning point in property rights instability for
Argentina. We agree with numerous scholars that the instability of property rights originated with
the Presidency of Juan Peron but argue that a very plausible counterfactual is that Juan Peron
would never have been elected had it not been for the electoral fraud perpetrated by the
Conservatives in the 1930s. This is critical because we maintain that it was the erosion of a
budding belief system - entailing honest elections, and a potential role for the Supreme Court as
powerful veto over legislative or executive expropriations - and the failure to solidify this system
during the 1930s that lead to the initial populist appeal of Peron.

Undoubtedly the world collapse of commodity prices played a role but this an insufficient condition
because there was an earlier agricultural collapse in 1920 which did not topple the Argentine government.
Most analysts argue it was the ineptitude of the aging President Yrigoyen which prompted the coup. For
analyses of this period of Argentine history see (Halperin Donghi, 2004; Ansaldi et. al., 1995; Botana et.
al., 1997; Peralta Ramos, 1992; Pereira, 1983; Potash, 1969; Rouquie, 1983; Sanguineti, 1975 and Schilizzi
Moreno, 1973)
8
The Court may also have felt that the emergency of the Great Depression warranted a departure from the
Constitution. In the U.S. in Home Building and Loan vs Blaisdell decided by the Supreme Court in 1934,
the court ruled the emergency conditions warranted a temporary departure from the contract clause. The
decision allowed the state of Minnesota to issue a moratorium on foreclosures. See Alston (1984).
9
There is an abundant literature on the proximate origins and consequences of Peronism, see (Brennan,
1998; Ciria, 1983; Crawley, 1984; Di Tella, 1998; Elizagaray, 1985; Fayt, 1967; Ferrero, 1976; Germani,
1973; Gerchunoff, 1989; Halperin Donghi, 1975; Halperin Donghi, 1994; Horowitz, 1990; Jones, et. al.,
2002; Kenworthy, 1975; Little, 1973; Matsushita, 1983; Murmis and Portantiero, 1972; O’Donnell, 1973;
Rock, 1985; Romero, 1988; Sabato, 1988; Smith, 1972; Smith, 1974; Torre, 1990; Torre, 1989; Torre, 1988
and Waisman, 1987)
10
Spiller and Tommasi (2004) argue that the political institutions in Argentina, especially since 1947 have
lead directly to volatility of economic policy. They report that Argentina’s economic policy from 19701990 ranked as the 7th most volatile out of 106 countries.

6

Our analysis proceeds in Section II with a brief overview of the institutional development
of Argentina from its consolidation in 1862 up to the military coup of 1930. Based on our
interpretation of the evidence, the military coup and the decade that followed represent a critical
juncture for Argentina we discuss in depth the electoral fraud of the 1930s. In Section III we
analyze Peron’s rise to the Presidency and estimate an electoral counterfactual for Peron without
the fraud of the 1930s. In Section IV, we discuss the policies of Peron and the impeachment of all
but one of the Supreme Court Justices. In Section V, we offer concluding remarks.

II. The Institutional Foundations and Political Evolution of Argentina
The Argentine Constitution, established in 1853, was the foundation of the political
system, though it took until 1862 for the political consolidation of the provinces. In many
respects, it resembled the U.S. model, in which the separation of powers and democratically
elected government officials are the foundation of the political system. Like its U.S. counterpart
the Argentine political system was Presidential with two legislative chambers, the Deputies (seats
according to population) and the Senate (seats by Province), and an independent Judiciary to
“check and balance” the power of the other two branches. The political foundation of Argentina
was federalist with de jure though not de facto rule of law.
An important element in a democracy is the protection of the rights of the minorities.11 In
Argentina, the protection of the property rights of the landholders in the Pampas was instrumental
in promoting investment and growth (Adelman, 1999; Diaz Alejandro, 1970; Cortes Conde,
1998). Protecting property rights is not an easy proposition for the judiciary is in “continual
jeopardy of being overpowered, awed or influenced by its co-ordinate branches” (Hamilton,
Federalist Paper No. 78).12 Hamilton like others saw the solution for independence in the
appointment of life tenure for Supreme Court Justices. Argentina followed suit.
After 1862, Argentina created an institutional framework that produced considerable
economic growth (Adelman, 1999).13 From 1862 until 1930, Argentina provided a good example
of political stability, though not an open democracy until 1912, with the passage of the secret
ballot.14 Prior to 1914, Conservative governments controlled the Presidency and both houses of
Congress. The Conservatives secured their hold on power through intimidation and fraud,
11

See in particular, Federalist Paper 51 by Madison. See also Meny and Knapp (1998).
The importance of judicial review over legislative statutes was firmly established by Chief Justice
Marshall in Marbury v. Madison in 1803.
13
Saiegh (2008) argues that the degree of credible commitment in the post 1862 period varied with the
commitment to the gold standard; tighter partisan control over the legislature; and ability of Presidents to
control the agenda through having a broad coalition.
14
We begin in 1862 because of the previous split between Buenos Aires and the rest of Argentina. See
Saiegh (2008) for an excellent analysis of the oscillations in power amongst the elites which did have an
impact on the rate at which Argentina could borrow. Nevertheless, this period was relatively stable
politically. Argentina passed legislation adopting the secret ballot and it went into effect in the election of
1914.
12

particularly in the Pampas, which was the dominant force in the Conservative party.
Conservatives across Argentina were not homogenous but they shared the overall vision of the
structure and operation of government. It appears as if the President dominated the legislative
agenda but this most likely resulted from similar interests because Congress had the power to
veto.15 The Supreme Court exercised some independence though the narrative accounts indicate
that they shared a similar ideological view to that of Congress and the President. Accordingly, the
division of power, and political institutions, were in place to sustain the Conservative elite in
power and foster their economic interests.
By the late 19th century and continuing into the 20th century, pressure mounted for a
more open political system.16 In an effort to maintain legitimacy the Conservative government
introduced the Saenz Peña Law in 1912, which established the secret ballot and a more strict
control of the electoral roll (Rock 1975; Halperin Donghi 1995; Smith 1974).17 As a result of the
Saenz Peña Law, Yrigoyen from the Radical Party won the Presidency in 1916 and the Radical
Party controlled the House of Deputies. The Conservative Party continued to hold a majority in
the Senate. Divided governance held through the elections of the 1920s. From 1912 to 1930, the
political system became more transparent and we characterize it as period of evolution towards
the constitutional precepts of rule of law within a democratic regime. The increase in the number
of Roll Call votes is an indicator that Congress was not simply rubberstamping the will of the
President (See Figure 1).

For a current view of the agenda setting power of a President, see Alston and Mueller (2006). Spiller and
Tommasi (2004) argue that the President in Argentina has considerably greater de facto agenda setting
power than Congress. They apply their analysis primarily to the period from Peron to the present.
16
In the 1890s, the Radical party organized a revolt (La Revolucion del Parque) in order to overthrow the
government. It was unsuccessful, and the Conservatives continued controlling the electoral system.
17
The Radical Party was the most instrumental player forcing the passage of the Saenz Peña Law. Hipolito
Yrigoyen, the head of the Radical Party, called voters to abstain from voting until the government reformed
the balloting process ( Canton 1973).

8

A Roll Call vote can be used by constituents to measure and monitor the voting behavior of
representatives and gave party leaders and constituents a benchmark for rewarding or punishing
party members. The use of Roll Call votes increase dramatically after 1916 and then declined in
the mid-1930s with the onset of fraud.
The improvement in democracy after 1916 is also reflected in the increase in the number
of voters: from 1918 to 1931 the voting population increased by 133.5%.18 In our view, it was the
“Camelot Period” for Argentina: the President had some agenda setting power but was
constrained by veto power of the Senate and Judicial review.19 Within this institutional setting,
the Supreme Court exercised some independence from the executive and legislative branches. We
are not arguing that the Court always ruled in favor of strong protection of property rights but
rather that they were able to exercise independence. We have examples of the Court ruling
against as well as for a strict interpretation of property rights. For example the Court in Ercolano
ruled in favor of regulating rents while subsequently in Horta v. Harguindeguy (1922) the
Supreme Court verdict struck down an emergency law that controlled urban rents. In both cases
of rent control the court went against the preferences of the President and the Legislative
Chambers.
Compared to the past, elections were generally clean. The Radical party constrained by
the Senate continued to operate the same export driven economic model of the former
Conservative dominated governments (Llach, 1985; O’connell, 1986; Cortes Conde; 1998 and
2000). But, there were some significant domestic departures from previous policy. In particular,
the Radical party was able to introduce some new legislation favoring agricultural tenants
(Solberg, 1987; Ansaldi, 1993). The dominance of the Radicals came to an end with the military
coup of 1930, which ousted an aging Yrigoyen.20 This was the first successful military coup in
Argentine history and was an affront to the electoral process of the constitution. The military
coup marked the beginning of the reversals of democratic reforms (Smith 1974; Pereira 1983;
Rouquie 1983; Sanguinetti 1975; Potash 1969). Once the military government took power on
September 6, 1930, they looked for legitimacy. Perhaps for survival purposes the Supreme Court
gave its approval to the military coup describing it as a “triumphant revolution’ (Pellet Lastra
2001: 63). Instead of approving the coup, the role of the court according to the Constitution, was
18

In the decade under fraud, from 1931 to the 1942 election, the number of voters grew only 30.2%, even
though the number of eligible voters grew considerably more than in the earlier decades. This reduction in
the rate of increase in voters was despite voting being mandatory (Molinelli, et. al., 1999).
19
We stress that the movement to a system of checks and balances is evolutionary and was never
completed in Argentina. Hipolito Yrigoyen, the first President from the Radical Party, resorted to Federal
interventions 15 times during his term in order to circumvent the power of the Conservatives. We thank
Sebastian Saeigh for this comment.
20
Yrigoyen was President from 1916 to1922 and again from 1928 until the coup in 1930. In the interim
years, 1923-1928, Alvear, also a Radical, was President.

9

to assess the constitutionality of the coup if someone contested the military rule in a civil suit. No
one brought such a suit. The other alternative always available for any Supreme Court Justice
was resignation, the path chosen by one Supreme Court Justice, Figueroa Alcorta (Pellet Lastra
2001).
The Conservatives thought that the demise of Yrigoyen and the control of the
government would give them enough power to defeat the Radicals in clean elections, which they
scheduled for the Province of Buenos Aires in April 1931. However, the Radicals won the
provincial election of 1931, but the military government annulled the results.21 As a consequence,
the Conservatives resorted subsequently to fraud to stay in power, although this policy
undermined their chances to win in free elections. 22 The military government called for a
National election in 1932 but forbade any candidates from the Radical Party who had been in
government during Yrigoyen’s last term. In a protest response to the prohibition, the Radical
Party chose not to participate in the election. As a result, the Conservatives returned to power
(Halperin Donghi, 2004). We note that the actions taken by the Conservatives transpired in
context of a world recession and the Conservatives believed that the recessionary times
necessitated a Conservative led government. We speculate that in the absence of the world
recession that Argentina would not have witnessed a decade of electoral fraud. In short, there was
a belief that emergency times prompted the use of emergency powers.
When the Radical party returned to electoral competition in 1935, observers believed that
if fair elections were held the Radicals would win (Walter 1985: 148). The first test was the
gubernatorial and provincial congressional elections on November 3, 1935. Fraud pervaded the
election.23. Police intervened and ejected Radical and Socialist monitors from the polls (Halperin
Donghi 2004; Sanguinetti 1975). The Conservatives replaced votes and induced people to vote
against their wishes. Many newspapers reported the fraud. Three of the five members of the
Electoral Board, which oversaw elections, ruled that the election should be nullified.24 But, based
on a law passed by the Conservatives in 1934, nullification required the support of two-thirds of
the Electoral Board, i.e., four of the five members. The Conservatives changed the Provincial
Constitution in 1933, which contained a new electoral system for the elections in the province.

21

The military government did not justify their action. No one formally contested the annulment and the
military had the coercive power of the state on their side.
22
For the Conservatives of Buenos Aires, electoral fraud was excused as a “necessary evil.” Crucial in
determining both their attitude and their reaction to fraud was the traumatic experience of April 1931. …
(Walter 1985 125).
23
“But, whereas the April 1931 election was considered generally ‘clean’, the November 3, 1935, contest
was immediately and universally condemned as one of the most fraudulent and irregular in Argentine
history. It was not to be the exception. Over the next decade most national and provincial elections in the
province, and many elsewhere, were to repeat the pattern initiated in November 1931 and refined and made
much more blatant and widespread four years later.” Walter, 1985:148.
24
Legislation at the Provincial level establishes the rules governing the electoral board.

10

With the constitutional change, the Provincial Congress, passed the new electoral law, Provincial
law No 4,316. Detractors called it “the Law of Fraud” (Ley del Fraude). The new law created a
system by which the Conservatives controlled the electoral board, which in practice meant that
the electoral board rejects any fraud reports. (Congreso Nacional, Diario de Sesiones Honorable
Camara de Diputados de la Nacion, 1936:10-11.) The fraud enabled the Conservatives to gain
control of the government.25 The Supreme Court did not intervene on the grounds that the issue
was political and not constitutional. But the Supreme Court could have acted because federal
judges from the Province of Buenos Aires ruled on the fraud; they reached a verdict confirming
the irregularities denounced by the Socialist and Radical Party. Furthermore, the President of the
Supreme Court of the Province of Buenos Aires, who was part of the Electoral Board voted to
declare the election null (Sessions Diary Deputies Chamber, 1936).26
Fearing similar fraud at the national Congressional elections in 1936, Radicals petitioned
the government for guarantees against fraud. The election was important because it was the
prelude to the 1938 Presidential election.27 Though the National Electoral Board had authority
over the election, the Radicals still feared that fraud would rule the day:
Great suspicion exists with respect to what will happen today in the Province of Buenos
Aires… If citizens find the path of voting obstructed again, the Congress will have a new
reason to discuss this. It will have to consider reestablishing the republican government
system. This system of government cannot exist if the majority wish -within the
constitutional limitations- is not respected or when we cannot tell what the legitimate
majority is (La Prensa, March 1, 1936).
True to the worries of the Radicals, the Conservative Party won the election by fraud. Officials
monitoring elections reported fraud before and during the elections.28 The Deputies from the
Radical and Socialist parties proposed a declaration in the Deputies Chamber to nullify elections
in the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Mendoza, and Santa Fe. The case went to the
Petitions and Power Commission (Peticiones y Poderes), which had advisory power to the whole
Chamber of Deputies.29 After reviewing the evidence, the Commission advised the Chamber of
Deputies to declare the national election in the Province of Buenos Aires null (Halperin Donghi,

25

According to Halperin Donghi (2004), the conservatives only resorted to fraud to maintain a majority,
rather than a super-majority. Their goal was to stay in power and eventually return to free elections.
26
The President of the Supreme Court of Buenos Aires can declare an election fraudulent but he has no
authority to do anything about it. It is in the hands of the Electoral Board or the President of Argentina
could intervene under his emergency powers but the President was a Conservative.
27
At the time the Province of Buenos Aires had nearly half of the population. Winning in the Province of
Buenos Aires is a bellwether for winning a majority of the seats in the lower chamber and winning the
Presidency.
28
Reports of fraud were common. See Diary of the Deputies Chamber (1936) for a complete list of the
reports of fraud in the Provinces.

2004).30 If the Radical party obtained the nullification and then won in clean elections, they
would most likely win in a clean Presidential election in 1938. The situation looked good for
Radicals. They had a strong case and the questionably elected Conservative Deputies from
Buenos Aires could not vote. This gave the opposition a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
Facing an almost certain loss, the only hope of the members of the conservative coalition,
Concordancia, was to prevent a vote. Instead of being in the Chamber for the debate or vote, the
members of the Concordancia voted with their feet and did not appear in the chamber. The
absence of the Concordancia made it impossible to form a quorum and vote for the resolution.
Without a quorum, the Deputies Chamber petitioned the President to use his executive power to
force the recalcitrant Concordancia Deputies to occupy their seats. The President denied the
request. The Deputies continued in session waiting in vain for the Concordancia Deputies to
return. Finally, the Senate, dominated by the Conservatives, decided to put an end to the struggle
(Halperin Donghi 2004). Without constitutional authority, the Senate declared the election
legitimate.
Not accepting defeat, the deputies from the Radical and Socialist parties continued to
push for the nullification of the election. They even tried to introduce a bill to impeach the
President for allowing the Senate intervention. But again, the Concordancia retired their deputies
and there was not a quorum. It was a war of attrition and by the close of the session the Radicals
gave up, realizing that they did not have the needed support of the President or the Senate. The
Congressional session ended with the Concordancia still in power. Newspapers and other
narrative accounts widely document the electoral fraud in the province of Buenos Aires (Halperin
Donghi, 2004). In part, because of the fraud, historians refer to the 1930s as the “infamous
decade.” (Schillizzi Moreno 1973; Privitellio and Romero 2000).
Given that the Conservatives managed to “win” the election by fraud in 1936, they
continued to resort to fraud and intimidation through the remainder of the 1930s. Only in 1940
did President Ortiz try to stop electoral fraud (Crawley 1984). Ortiz believed that with the end of
the Great Depression there was no longer the need to resort to the emergency use of fraud to stay
in power Halperin Donghi (2004). The Conservatives had a good track record of handling the
economy during the emergency of the Great Depression and Ortiz believed that the electorate
would reward the Conservatives by electing them in a clean election. The electorate did not share
his view and voted for the Radicals. Ortiz died in office and his successor Castillo again resorted
to fraud in the 1942 election. It took a military coup in 1943 to bring the reign of the
Conservatives to an end.
Most of the electoral fraud in the 1930s occurred in the Pampas. In Table I we show that
the Province of Buenos Aires alone accounts for 28% of the denouncements of fraud. If we
30

Buenos Aires represented the most egregious use of fraud.

12

consider all of the Provinces in the Pampas they account for nearly 55% of the total reports form
1934-1942. One might speculate that naturally there were more reports of fraud in the Pampas
because this was the most populous region in the country. A single denouncement by the
electoral board though may represent thousands of individual complaints and hence we cannot
weight the denouncements by population in any meaningful way. Given fraud was pursued
strategically; we believe that the reports of fraud in Congress give a good geographic
representation of its use by the Conservatives.

Notes: There was no fraud reported formally or in the press for Cordoba. For the Provinces of Jujuy, San Luis
and Santiago del Estero there is no data from the Electoral Board though there were complaints in Congress of
fraud.
Data on fraud reports do not exist for the remaining four provinces.

It is important to point out that in Cordoba the Conservatives refrained from fraud but
consistently lost the elections to the Radicals in the 1930s.31 We believe that it is not coincidental
that the province of Cordoba was the only province of the Pampas in which Peron lost to the
Radical Party in 1946. The Radical Party held approximately the same degree of support across
provinces in the Pampas during the “clean” elections in Argentina, between 1918 and 1942 - See
Table II.32 If we examine the vote for Radicals in the clean elections – 1918 to 1930, and 1940compared to the fraudulent elections of 1932 to1938 and 1942, Buenos Aires and Santa Fe stand
out for the drop in the Radical vote during the fraudulent elections. This matches the evidence in
Table 1 on reports of fraud. Fraud is most apparent in the 1938 election when the Radicals
received only14.4% of the vote for Deputies across the country. The election of 1940 was clean
with the Radicals receiving 54.2% of the vote for Deputies (Molinelli et. al. 1999). It is important
to note that, even with the evident fraudulent practices, the participation of voters did not fall
abruptly (Table III). This result is most likely because voting is mandatory in Argentina.
31

Later in the paper we will discuss the possible explanations for the lack of fraud in Cordoba. We will use
Cordoba along with the Capitol Territory as “controls” for clean elections.
32
By “clean”we mean in comparison to the fraudulent elections in the 1930s. All elections had some
irregularities.

The accusations of fraud in the Pampas overtime ultimately produced a backlash amongst
the electorate, despite a relatively good performance of the Argentine economy during the

14

depression of the 1930s.33 Increasingly so, the electorate viewed the rule of the Conservatives as
illegitimate. This sentiment against the so-called oligarchy accounts for the widespread popularity
of the military coup in 1943.34
The Conservative regimes of the 1930s, in spite of their flirtations with fascist reformism,
brought to a halt the modest momentum for political and social reform started by the
Radical governments. Their failure to buttress the relative healthy economic structure
with social and political arrangements allowing for growing security and political
participation for rural and urban masses contributed to the creation of revolutionary
possibilities.” In short, the Conservatives appeared to have won the battle by fraud but
lost the war by abandoning the rule of law (Diaz Alejandro 1970: 107-108).

III. Peron’s Rise to the Presidency: the Military Rule 1943-1945
The military coup of 1943 opened a new era in Argentina, one characterized by political
and economic instability.35 Like Diaz Alejandro we argue that the failure of Argentina to sustain
the transition to a system of checks and balances, which had been in place from 1914 to 1930 led
to the rise of Peron and the new Peronist institutions. When the military coup ousted the
Conservative government in 1943, many thought that the new government would limit its action
to restoring democracy in the country and establishing an alliance with the U.S. against the Axis
powers. This might have happened but a branch of the army with a nationalistic ideology shortly
replaced the initial military government (Crawley, 1984; Rouquie, 1983 and Ciria, 1975). Peron
was part of the nationalistic branch called the Grupo de Oficiales Unidos (GOU).36 Peron
occupied several important positions: First he was Vice-minister of the Ministry of War and Head
of the newly created Secretary of Labor in 1943; he also was Vice-President and Minister of War
33

For a convincing account of the positive policies implemented by the Conservative governments and
general economic performance in the 1930s, see Della Paolera and Taylor 1998, 1999 and 2001; Alhadeff,
1989; Balsa (1992; Diaz Alejandro 1970; Di Tella and Zimelman 1967; Cortes Conde 1998; Di Tella 1979;
Pinedo 1971; Vazquez-Presedo 1978; and Walter 1985. The historical accounts consistently give good
marks for economic policies in Argentina though the economy declined relative to other Latin American
countries.
34
“…tainted by a decade of graft and electoral fraud, neither the Concordancia nor the Radicals was
capable of arousing a pessimistic and apathetic public. In 1943 “the average man-in-the-street” wrote
Ysabel Fisk, “was embittered and disillusioned by the spectacle of the fraud and corruption of the
Conservative governments..” Goldwert, 1972, 77-78.
Walter (1985) explains the mechanism of fraud for the 1938 election: “The Concordancia was to use fraud
selectively. In most provinces and in the federal capital, the contests were to be honest, the conservatives
expecting to triumph in certain districts and the Radicals allowed winning in others. But the keys to the
election were the provinces of Santa Fe and Buenos Aires, both in the hands of Concordancia supporters,
and the ‘official’ victories were to be guaranteed. Buenos Aires again provided the most notorious
examples of fraud in the nation with abuses which were carbon copies of those perpetrated in November
1935 and March 1936. … If the results in Buenos Aires had gone the other way, Alvear [the Radical
candidate for president] would have recaptured the presidency, although there were reports that in such
eventuality the armed forces would have prevented the UCR-standard-bearer from taking office.” Walter,
1985: 165.
35
Clearly the outbreak of WW II opened up a new divide in Argentina between those favoring the Fascists
and others supporting the Allied forces.
36
The GOU drew their inspiration from Hitler and Mussolini. (Crawley, 1984)

15

when Colonel Farrell, a friend of Peron’s assumed the Presidency of the Country in 1944. From
his position as the Head of Labor, Peron lured labor union leaders into backing him politically. As
Head of Labor and as Vice-President, Peron used both the carrot and stick with unions. He
proposed legislation improving work conditions for labor and he jailed union leaders who
disagreed with him (Matsushita, 1983). As a result, the emerging Labor Party would form the
backbone for his bid for the Presidency in 1946.37
The largest traditional political parties formed the opposition to Peron: the Unión Cívica
Radical Comité Nacional, Socialist, Progressive, Democrat and Communist parties. They formed
the Union Democratica, and sought to capture power once the military government called for
national elections. The Conservatives, who had been in government during the 1930s, supported
the Union Democratica, but they were not part of it.38 Indeed the support of the Conservatives
may have hurt the Union Democratica as some voters may have taken this a signal that the
Conservative elite were still in power. The traditional parties emphasized the lack of democracy
of the military regime and its political heir, Peron. They called themselves the “defenders of
Democracy and the Constitution.” They vowed to return to the provisions of the Constitution,
which meant that they planned to nullify many of Peron’s policies.39 The political confrontation
was a clash of two different political models of government. During the military government of
1943-46, the Supreme Court was the only standing check to the unfettered will of the Executive
Power. The radical changes Peron introduced usually clashed with the Court, and the opposition
to Peron relied on the Court as the protector of the Constitution and its rights:
The key to the problem is this. Since June 4 1943 the country does not have a legislative branch
to discuss the issues pertaining to Congress. .. Currently these decisions come from the
Executive, created by the revolutionary movement, without any control except for the power of
the Judiciary, whose pronouncements cannot be immediate because the Court depends on an
interested party contesting the constitutionality of a Decree or law.” La Nación, July 25 1945.

The Union Democratica proclaimed that they wanted to return to the road leading to a
legitimate system of checks and balances. On the other side, the Peronist coalition represented a
populist movement that opposed the Constitutional dictates of rule of law. The Unions viewed the
Court as its enemy because they perceived the Court as an ally of the oligarchy and the old
regime. In a public document produced on October 16, 1945 the Unions clearly established their
position:

37

The labor party endorsed Peron but they had hoped to maintain their independence. See Gay 1999 and
Horowitz 1990.
38
Indeed, the Union Democratica initially formed in 1942, hoping to win against the Conservatives in what
would have been an election in 1943.
39
Foreign capital and the U.S. embassy aligned with the Democratic Union and declared their distaste for
Peron’s policies. Given the nationalist sentiments at the time the public position of the U.S. may have
helped Peron.

16

1) Against handing over the government to the Supreme Court and against any oligarchic
cabinet; 2) for the formation of a government that would guarantee democracy and liberty
for the country, consulting the opinions of the unions; 3) for the holding of elections as
announced; 4) for the lifting the state of siege and the liberation of all civilian and
military prisoners who had distinguished themselves for their clear and firm democratic
convictions and their identification with the cause of the workers; 5) for the preservation
of the ‘social conquests’ and their enlargement, and for the application of the new statute
governing trade unions; and 6) for the immediate passage of the decree on wage increases
and the introduction of the mandatory minimum, index-linked salary (Crawley, 1984: 9495).
The document clearly states the views of the Peronist movement towards the Court. In their first
point the unions lump the Court and former oligarchic regime together. In the second point,
Unions did not belief that the Court was a guarantee of democracy and freedom. Points 5 and 6
are very important because many of the measures passed by Peron to favor the workers may have
been deemed unconstitutional and, in the case of Peron losing the elections, the Court most likely
would nullify these reforms. 40
Many of Peron’s reforms were under scrutiny by the Supreme Court, and faced the threat of
unconstitutionality. Among the most important reforms we note the following:
1. Under the auspices of the National Department of Labor and as Secretary of Labor, Peron
implemented numerous labor reforms from 1943 to 1945. Peron lured Union leaders, and
formed new loyal unions by displacing former union leaders from the Socialist and
Communist party. Through the National Department of Labor Peron implemented
revolutionary regulations, like the Estatuto del Peon, and other legislation in favor of
workers. He also used this agency to reach salary agreements with business, which gave
large wage increases to workers. The problem with the National Department of Labor
was that all its reforms were potentially unconstitutional, and if the Radicals, or any other
traditional party, came back to power, businesses were going to petition the Supreme
Court to nullify the reforms. The constitutional issue over the National Department of
Labor was one of abusing its jurisdictional authority. The National Department of Labor
was created in 1907 by Presidential Decree, and not authorized by Congress until 1912.
In its authorization in 1912, Congress specified that the National Department of Labor
could regulate labor relations only in Federal territory, the provincial governments were

40

After winning the election, but before assuming the presidency Peron asked the military government to
pass other sweeping reforms: creation of IAPI (Instituto Argentino para la Promocion del Intercambio),
which monopolized all foreign sales of grains; the nationalization of the Central Bank; and the
nationalization of the banking system.

17

in charge of their own regulations.41 Constitutionally, Peron only had authority in the city
of Buenos Aires and the National Territories.42
2. The Supreme Court had already ruled against some of the reforms of Peron. In 1945
Peron created a special court for work related cases; workers could go to this special
court instead of going to ordinary courts. The Supreme Court declared that the manner in
which the government created the special court was unconstitutional.43 Peron, attacked
the decision stating: “The truth is that this decision, adopted a few days before the
elections, is intended as a rude strike to the Secretary of Labor and it constitutes a first
step toward undoing the social improvements reached by the workers” (Diario de
Sesiones del Honorable Senado de la Nacion Constitutido en tribunal, T. VI, December
5th 1946: 90). Despite the ruling by the Court the government created the new courts
though the Supreme Court justices refused to participate in the inauguration of the new
judges, as a sign of protest (La Nación, July 21, 1945).44

41

See Gallo, 2006, for a general discussion of the dominance of provincial authority over federal authority
concerning most regulatory matters. See Schoultz, 1983: 33-34, for a specific discussion of the creation of
the National Department of Labor and how Peron’s use of it led to purging the Supreme Court.
42
The Supreme Court ruled that the Executive Power Decree of November 27, 1943, violated the
Constitution by transforming a provincial institution into a federal institution. The Decree established that
Branches of the Department of Labor could enforce Federal laws in Provinces, violating Provincial
jurisdiction. The Court stated that: “Not even the Congress has the authority to do such a thing” (La
Prensa, 2/3/46).
43
The Association of Lawyers backed up the decision of the Supreme Court: “Even though The Supreme
Court has recognized certain powers to the de facto government, it has resolved that the creation of new
courts by decree, eliminating the jurisdiction of existing courts, is incompatible with the articles 18 and 94
of the Constitution. This affects the independence of the Judicial Power and it is not indispensable for the
correct functioning of the state” (Supreme Court resolution of April 2 1945 as reported in La Nación, July
12, 1945). The very next day, in a public speech to workers, Angel Borlenghi (a Union Leader) said:
“…when in 1930 a de facto government was established that was allied with the oligarchy, did the
constitutionalists say that that government did not have legislative attributions? That was a bloody
dictatorship that incarcerated workers, students and political opponents, tortured people in prisons and
killed without having a state of war… There was none of the current constitutionalists that defended the
National interests. … The revolution of June 4th, despite all its mistakes, can offer the legacy of its social
justice work. In this matter the working class claims that it does not have any scruples with respect to the
Constitution. It can be part of the history of the country if the actions of Peron purges the country of fraud,
bribes and special arrangements, and listens to the people from different sectors and especially the workers’
unions which are the only associations that do not have relations with the oligarchy” La Nación, July 13,
1945.
44
On July 25, 1945 Peron inaugurated the new Labor Courts and said: “the saddest thing that can happen to
a country is that there are many men that claim for justice and they cannot obtain it, when this justice is
claimed by the poorer. … Laws have value when they are enforced. Everyone should be included in the law
and when this law is violated he should resort to its judges and the Nation will support his claim through
the representatives of the law. Sadly, in our country, laws are not respected because there is no legal
conscience in the people. I, as the Secretary of Labor, hope that the working mass has a legal conscience
for labor laws so we can give the example to the rest of the Argentines on how to respect the law.” La
Nación, July 26 1945. On July 30 the newspaper La Nación answered “The Supreme Court has constantly
watched over the respect of the fundamental law, restraining the political power inside its limits. … These
are precedents that are important to consider in the analysis of the claim that laws are not respected because
there is no legal conscience among the people. If this problem should exist, the cause would be the attitude
of the governments that depart from the law. By doing that, Governments give a bad example, which is

18

3. In December 1945, just a month and a half before the election, Peron created the
Aguinaldo. This legislation forced businesses to pay workers an extra monthly salary per
year. This measure was very popular among workers and the Unions, but businesses tried
to organize a general lockout, which was successful in terms of the number businesses
that complied. Of course, businesses claimed that this measure was unconstitutional and
waited for the elections, hoping for a Radical victory and for the Supreme Court to
reestablish order.
Given the departure of Peron’s policies from the Constitution, from 1943 to 1946, it was normal
that the Peronist movement reviled the Supreme Court. As Pellet Lastra explains
If the justices of the Conservative Supreme Court would have limited their actions to the support
of the military coup on June 7th of 1943 and maintained a neutral position with respect to the de
facto presidential power, it is very possible that the history of the Supreme Court and the Judicial
system would have been very different from what it was. But Repetto and the other justices were
not resigned to be complacent spectators of the maneuvers of the de facto governments. … They
had internalized the republican division of powers and the judicial independence, formally and de
facto. Their convictions were liberal and individualistic, considering that everybody occupies their
place in a natural and correct way (Pellet Lastra:108).

Furthermore, the Radicals and Socialists ran the presidential campaign under the slogan
that they wanted to go back to the Constitution, that is, to eliminate many of Peron’s reforms. As
a result, public opinion was divided over the role and legitimacy of the Supreme Court.45 The
opposition to Peron viewed the Supreme Court as the last resort to check unfettered power. On
the other hand, Peron’s supporters saw the Supreme Court as an obstacle to reform. Once Peron
won the Presidential election, the Supreme Court had to be purged in order for reforms to pass the
Constitutional test and to guarantee the support for further reforms. The Peronist movement
promised future revolutionary changes in institutions for its constituencies.46 Though they may
not have known it at the time, citizens in Argentina found themselves not just electing a new
president but also choosing between two different systems that would determine the institutional
structure of the country for many decades to come. Though close, the citizens chose populism
over a return to the path of checks and balances followed from 1914 until the interruption of the
coup of 1930 and the fraud of the 1930s. The appeal of Juan Peron was in part a reaction to the
very influential. When governments respect the Constitution and the laws, it would be unnecessary to ask if
the people have a legal conscience.” La Nación, July 30, 1945.
45
The divided public opinion hearkens back to the actions of the U.S. Supreme Court during FDR’s New
Deal. After the U.S. declaring as unconstitutional several of the pivotal pieces FDR’s New Deal, many
people simply viewed the court as “out of touch” with the sentiments of public.
46
The Peronist movement in Argentina shares an ideological space with the late 19th century Populist Party
in the US. The U.S. Populists opposed big business and drew its support from the Mid-West and the South.
Like the Peronists, the U.S. Populists saw the Supreme Court as aligned with big business. After the U.S.
Supreme Court nullified the income tax, some members of the Populist Party in Congress called for
impeachment of the Justices who sided with the majority in declaring the income tax unconstitutional. Not
until the New Deal when FDR proposed a bill to enlarge the Supreme Court, would there be another threat
to the independence of the Supreme Court.

19

electoral fraud in the 1930s47. As a test of the importance of fraud in the election of Peron, we
estimated the following logistic regression model:

Peron46 i = α 0 + α1 Fraud i + α 2Cattlei + α 3 IndustryEmploymenti +

α 4 Re ntersi + ei
where:
Peron46 is the natural logarithm of the percentage of votes the Peronist party obtained in
the 1946 election divided by one minus the percentage of votes obtained by the Peronist
party in the 1946 election Peron46 = ln (% Peron /(1 − % Peron) ) ;
Fraud is the difference in the share of votes for the Radical party between the elections of
1940 and 1938. This variable captures the importance of fraud because the 1940 election
was relatively clean. 48
Cattle are the log of the number of cattle per farm and represent the strength of the landed
elite who opposed Peron;
Industry Employment is the log of the industrial employment in each county and
represents the strength of unions who supported Peron;
Renter: is the percentage of farms under some form of tenancy.
By all accounts, the election of 1938 was the most fraudulent with the Radicals receiving
only 14% of the votes in Buenos Aires. The election of 1940 was reputedly clean with the
Radicals receiving 54% of the vote; a level that they had not reached since 1930. In 1940,
President Ortiz, a Conservative, vowed to prevent fraud in the 1940 election of Deputies and
Governors. When confronted with fraud in the electoral contest for governor of Buenos Aires,
President Ortiz nullified the entire election despite little protest from the Deputies in the Radical
Party. In the re-election, the Radical party won a majority of seats in the Deputies Chamber. We
posit that the voters most discouraged by fraud and who wanted a change to populism were those
who voted for Radicals in the clean election of 1940 but whose votes in earlier elections,
especially 1938 had been reported as votes for Conservatives. We consider the voters where fraud
was most prevalent as those who most wanted a departure from the ways of the 1930s perpetrated
47

“…Conservative association with fraudulent political practices over the past fifteen years, with Buenos
Aires as the most glaring example, did much to damage public opinion of and respect for the traditional
political parties. This disrepute, in turn, enhanced Peron’s image as someone fresh and new on the
Argentine scene, relatively untainted by association with the political excesses of the ‘infamous decade”.
Walter, 1985: 198.
48
Changes in the percentage of votes the Radical party received in 1938 and 1940 have two sources. On
one hand, as we postulate, the change is an indication of the fraudulent practices of the Conservatives. Or,
not mutually exclusive the changes can be due to the changes in the preferences of voters. In order to
isolate these two effects we calculate the average change in the percentage of Radicals’ votes in the
provinces that ran clean elections, Cordoba and Capital Federal. The average growth was 1.8%.
Accordingly, we deducted this percentage from the provinces where fraudulent practices prevailed. The
econometric results are the same and we will provide them upon request.

by the Conservatives. We expect the discouraged voters to most likely vote for Peron in 1946
because Peron offered a clear departure from the past. Also, the dwindling support for the Radical
party after its lack of action against fraud in the second half of the 1930s and the shift of some
Radical leaders to the Peronist movement, gave Peron support from those voters discontented
with the current platform of the Radical Party in the 1946 election.
As you can see from the Descriptive Statistics in Table IV, the variation in the
percentage difference in vote for the Radicals between 1938 and 1940 was huge: from a decrease
of nearly 30 percentage points to an increase of 74 percentage points. The mean difference was an
increase of 26 percentage points suggesting that fraud was prevalent though varied considerably.
The remaining variables seem self-explanatory and capture special interests of the elite (cattle) or
the populist polices of Peron – support of unions and rent controls for tenants.

Source: National Census 1947 N= 234; Our data set consists of observations by county for the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba,
Entre Rios, Santa Fe, Corrientes, Santiago del Estero, Tucuman and Mendoza. The remaining Provinces did not have elections in 1940
so our data set is limited to the most populous Provinces. The votes in the remaining Provinces could not have influenced the outcome.

In Table V, we present the regression results. The results indicate that the vote for Peron
increased in counties where fraud was greater. The importance of this coefficient, as well as its
robustness to a variety of specifications, supports our narrative that the rise of Peron and
Peronismo was in part a response to the fraudulent elections of the during the decade of the
1930s. Our control variables all have the expected sign and most are reliable at the 1%
confidence level. The vote for Peron depended positively on the importance of industry and the
strength of tenants, as proxied by total farms rented. Peron faced opposition from the elite, as
proxied by Cattle production. Most importantly for our narrative of the rise of populism, in those
counties where fraud was the greatest in 1938, (and most of the decade) the voters tended to opt
for Peron because they had lost their belief that checks and balances would work in practice,
especially in times of crises. Even though there was dissatisfaction by some for the status quo and
strong support by special interests favored by Peron, he only won the total vote in 1946 by a
margin of 10%.

The coefficients on our control variables for special interests, especially the proxy for
renters and industry, capture Peron’s largesse to these groups. The result on the coefficient for
fraud in the 1930s is especially important because it demonstrates that the success of Peron in the
1946 election did not depend just on his populist policies but also on the lack of democratic
participation of the 1930s. The coefficient of the Fraud variable shows that the probability of
voting for Peron was 46%, with the other variables held at their means.49 If the Fraud variable
increases by one standard deviation over its mean value, the probability of voting for Peron
increases to 51%. If the Fraud variable is zero, the probability of voting for Peron drops to 40%.
As a consequence, we maintain that a reasonable counterfactual world is one where Peron would
not have been elected had it not been for the electoral fraud in the 1930s.50
An important supporting piece of evidence connecting fraud in the 1930s with the
election of Peron was the behavior of the Conservative Party in the Province of Cordoba, the third
most populous province in Argentina, contrasted with the experience in the Province of Buenos
Aires, the largest and most important province in Argentine politics. The Conservatives in
Cordoba did not pursue the same fraudulent practices as in other provinces in the Pampas
(Halperin-Donghi, 2004). As Figure 2 shows, and as we showed in the regression analysis, there
is a positive correlation between the difference in votes for the Radical party in the 1938-1940
elections and the percentage of votes received by Peron. Cordoba and Buenos Aires are at the
49

We made this calculation by simply setting the fraud coefficient to zero and then used the means of the
remaining independent variables times their coefficients to predict the vote for Peron which is 46%.
50
Using a simple OLS model with the percentage of vote for Peron as the dependent variable and our
independent variables identical to those of the logistic model we obtain similar results. Setting fraud equal
to zero the vote for Peron falls 11% and he would have lost the election.

extremes of this correlation, and, given that both provinces followed a different electoral path in
the 1930s, they offer an important comparison on the impact of fraud.51

The most popular rationales for the differing behavior in Cordoba are: 1) the
Conservatives felt strong enough to defeat the Radicals cleanly -they defeated the Radicals and
Yrigoyen in the 1930 election; and 2) the leadership of the Conservatives in Cordoba was
“morally” opposed to using fraudulent means to win an election (Ciria, 1975, Ferrero, 1976,
Halperin-Donghi, 2004). The Conservatives wanted Cordoba to be the example for the rest of the
provinces on how they could win elections without having to resort to Fraud (Halperin-Donghi,
2004). Despite the optimism of the Conservatives, the Radicals won every election in the
province of Cordoba during the 1930s, and in the election of 1946 Peron lost in Cordoba to the
Radicals in the presidential race by a margin of 10%, despite a large number of renters. As we
discussed before, in the Province of Buenos Aires, fraud was the norm in the 1930s, and Peron
obtained a strong victory in the 1946 presidential election. Fraud in the Province of Buenos Aires
depressed the percentage of votes obtained by the Radical party, as compared with the free
51

The vote in Cordoba in 1946 was for the Radical Party whereas the vote in Corrientes differed in that it
was always a staunchly Conservative Province. The opposition in Corrientes to Peron came from the power
of the Conservative elite.

election in Cordoba (Figure 3). The Radicals obtained the same percentage in the 1930 and 1940
elections, which were considered clean in both provinces, but they obtained a much higher
percentage in the 1946 presidential election in Cordoba than in Buenos Aires. The evidence
indicates that Peron faced a less hospitable climate in Cordoba, where democracy was preserved
in the 1930s, than in Buenos Aires, where, voters felt disenfranchised by the electoral system and
welcomed Peron’s policies.

IV. The Presidency of Juan Peron
When Peron won the election in 1946, he embarked on a campaign to consolidate his
political support and in so doing dramatically changed the political and economic institutions
within which Argentina had prospered. At the heart of his economic and political plan was an
assault on the property rights of landowners in the Pampas (Mora y Araujo and Llorente, 1980).
His political support came from urban labor in Buenos Aires, rural tenants and labor in the
Pampas and small landholders in the smaller provinces outside the Pampas. The support of urban
labor for Peron is well documented and not controversial so we will not discuss it here (Germani,
1973; Halperin Donghi, 1975; Horowitz, 1990; Matsushita, 1983; Murmis and Portantiero, 1972;
Smith, 1972 Tamarin, 1985 and Torre, 1990). Support from the provinces outside of the Pampas
was critical for Peron because of the influence of Senators from these regions. Before Peron, the
political representatives from these regions had voted with the Conservatives from the Pampas.

24

By the end of his first term, Peron through persuasion and coercion brought the various
constituents together under the Peronist Party.52

Institutional Change in the Outlying Provinces53
To capture the support of the small provinces Peron relied on two institutional changes,
ironically introduced by the Conservatives in the Great Depression: the Co-participation System
and the Central Bank.54 The Co-participation System authorized the Federal Government to
determine income tax rates, collect the tax revenues and rebate to the Provinces a predetermined
share of the revenues. This gave the central government enormous leverage over the politicians in
the provinces.55 In addition, Peron used the Central Bank for political purposes. Essentially, he
would “ask” the Central Bank to cover debts of provincial governments.
Peron initiated his own changes in governance as well as utilizing extant institutions. He
exercised control over labor through the Provincial branches of the Secretary of Labor. Peron
created the branches when he was Secretary of Labor during the military government and
expanded on their use (Horowitz, 1990). Peron also nationalized many utilities, which he used for
employment of loyal followers. As we noted earlier, the Supreme Court viewed several of his
changes as unconstitutional.
The use of these diverse instruments permitted the Federal government to overcome
political resistance from provincial governments to changes in the economic structure. However,
the use of them also increased the fiscal dependency of the Provinces on Federal government
resources.

Institutional Change in the Pampas
The main political enemy of Peron was the Conservative Party in the Pampas. The leaders
of the Conservative party consisted of the big landowners (estancieros) and their allies, foreign
52

Fearing a jail sentence, some recalcitrant members of the Radical Party fled to Uruguay. Peron lured the
rural Conservatives from the smaller provinces with transfers from the Federal government as we discuss in
the following section. In later elections, Peron engaged in extensive redistricting in order to increase the
number of Peronists elected.
53
For an elaboration on how the institutions created or maintained by Peron played out in the latter half of
the twentieth century, see Spiller and Tomassi (2004).
54
The Conservative government created the Central Bank in 1935 as an instrument to better control the
monetary policy during the Depression. On the importance of an independent Central Bank in eventually
leading to the privatization of Provincial banks in the 1990s, see Alston and Gallo, 2002. The National
Congress passed the Coparticipation Law in 1934.
55
Though the rebates back to the Provinces were not arbitrary the Co-participation system created a
dependency relationship and the Provinces may have feared that they might lose part of their rebate if they
did not cooperate with the Central government. As noted by Spiller and Tomassi (2004), the relationship
between the Central Government and the Provinces in the second part of the 20th Century was determined
by the dependency of the Provinces on Central Government’s revenue, and the need of the Central
Government for political support from the Provinces.

25

capitalists. The Pampas was the fertile wheat and cattle-producing region and accounted for the
majority of the country’s exports. To work the land, the estancieros relied on tenants and
sharecroppers. 56 Prior to Peron, the tenants, sharecroppers and smallholders voted with the
Radical Party. Peron aimed to help the tenants (and thereby hurt the owners) through controlling
rents and the prices of output (Diaz alejandro, 1970; Lattuada, 1986; Sandoval, 1988). Legislation
helping tenants was not new: the Radicals in the Deputies Chambers passed two reforms in the
1920s, though the conservative dominated Senate reduced the impact of the reforms. Peron faced
no such check on his power from the legislature. It is important to note that Peron’s legislation
applied almost exclusively to the Pampas.57 The legislation established local boards that
controlled rents and prohibited evictions. The government also controlled the price of wheat and
cattle by establishing monopoly power over purchases. After purchase, the government sold much
of the wheat on the international market and used the surplus to finance public expenditures, to
transfer funds to the smaller provinces in return for political support and some subsidies to
industry (Novick, 1986).
Legislation of rural rents began with the military government. In 1943, the government
fixed all rents to 1940 prices minus 20%, and declared all contracts extended until 1945. The
decree contained this provision just for contracts in the Pampas region. The government renewed
the rural rent controls in 1945, and then approved by law in Congress in 1948. As result, owners
tried (partially successfully) to switch to cattle (Elizagaray, 1985). The result was a decline in
cereal production and a bigger decline in investment in the Pampas (Veganzones and Winograd,
1997).
Peron designed his policies in the Pampas not simply to punish his enemies to help his
constituencies but he needed the policies to fund the overall institutional changes in the economy,
e.g. the nationalization of most utilities and many industries. With his allies in Congress, Peron
had little difficulty in passing the legislation that proved so punitive to the Pampas. However, the
actions taken surely represented a legislative “taking” of property rights which seems
unconstitutional. There was a potential check on the legislative “taking”: the Supreme Court. So
the question is: where was the Supreme Court?

The Impeachment of the Supreme Court
The Peronist coalition was formed by urban and rural workers, rural renters, and a branch
of the Radical party, as well as some conservative parties in the interior of the country. It is
natural that the arguments to impeach the Court were mainly the resistance of the Court to
56

As Taylor (1997) shows, the system of rent and sharecropping worked well.
From 1943 to 1946, the legislation of the Military government was limited to the Pampas. The law
regulating rents in 1948 applied to the whole country, but it affected primarily the Pampas because of the
high level of rent and sharecropping contracts.

57

26

Workers’ reforms and the support of the fraud in the 1930s. These arguments helped to bring
together workers and their Radical allies to support the impeachment. It is interesting to note that
a little more than a year after a popular demonstration asked for the Supreme Court justices to
take over the government, the same justices were impeached. Ideally an independent Supreme
Court represented the government’s guarantee that they would uphold the constitution.58 It is
questionable whether the Supreme Court was ever truly independent in Argentina but the court
did present a potential obstacle to Peron’s attack on private property rights.59
Shortly after being elected, Peron made it clear that he viewed the Supreme Court as
illegitimate:
In my opinion, I put the spirit of justice above the Judicial Power, as this is the principal
requirement for the future of the Nation. But I understand that justice, besides from being
independent has to be effective, and it cannot be effective if its ideas and concepts are not
with the public sentiment. Many praise the conservative sentiment of the Justices,
believing that they defend traditional beliefs. I consider that a dangerous mistake, because
it can put justice in opposition with the popular feeling, and because in the long run it
produces a rusted organism. Justice, in its doctrines, has to be dynamic instead of static.
Otherwise respectable popular yearnings are frustrated and the social development is
delayed, producing severe damage to the working classes when these classes, which are
naturally the less conservative, in the usual sense of the word, see the justice procedures
closed they have no other choice than to put their faith in violence. (Diario de Sesiones
del Honorable Senado de la Nacion Constitutido en tribunal, T. VI, December 5th 1946:
89).

With this speech the battle line was drawn: Peron embarked on a mission to impeach any
Justices that would not follow the Peronist line. In July 1946, the Peronist Congressman
Rodolfo Decker proposed the impeachment of all but one Justice. To a large extent,
impeaching the court matched the public sentiment of Peron’s constituents who believed
that the Court was, if not illegitimate, an obstacle to social policies.60 Peron’s goal was to
transform the basic institutional framework in Argentina. In the accusation against the
Court made in the Deputies chamber we can extract the sentiment against the old system
and all that it represented:
Since a military government interrupted the normal cycle of constitutional
government (1930), and after the Court granted this victorious movement both a
title and its overt recognition, the country saw the disconcerting show of
58

“The Supreme Court’s major contribution to the development of constitutional law arises from three
simple propositions. First, all laws, decrees, administrative orders, and judicial decisions must obey the
Constitution. Second, the judiciary is entrusted with guaranteeing the supremacy of the Constitution. Third,
the Court, as the final arbiter and custodian of the rights granted under the Constitution, is the place all turn
to for definitive interpretations and applications of constitutional principles.” Bidart Campos (1982:13).
59
Peron attacked not just the Supreme Court, but all sources of opposition to his policies. As a
consequence, even if his government came to power through a democratic electoral process, his policies
were far from being democratic, and resembled those of an authoritarian regime. Crawley (1984); and
Waisman, (1987).
60
In the U.S. following the election of FDR in 1932 many constituents viewed the decisions of the
Supreme as an obstacle to achieving social and economic progress under FDR’s New Deal proposals.
Constituents in Argentina may have felt similarly though the Argentine Supreme Court was never held in
as high regard as in the U.S.

27

arbitrariness. This episode lasted almost 17 years. Those were seventeen long
years in which the basic principles of our constitutional system have expired right
in front of those in charge of keeping them with all the integrity with which they
were created. This fact has been stated by respected sectors of public opinion and
the general media. After this military government legitimized by the Court
recognition, there was a succession of arbitrary governments of fraud, treason
and lie. Governments openly called constitutional, which in fact were merely -or
better said continued to be- defacto. They applied the theory wrongly used by the
Court when it legalized an unconstitutional government violating the
Constitution.
The initial mistake of the Court and its lack of courage to impose the return to the
true constitutional path cost the country a new military movement (1943).
Luckily, it would have the glorious deed of honor after a hard path filled with ups
and downs, surrounded by difficulties –which the Court also experienced- to
restore the entire rule of the Constitution. These difficulties were overcome by a
magnificent movement of social justice led by the creator of the Secretary of
Labor and Prevision, Colonel Peron. The recognition of two outlaw governments
and its guilty passivity during the years of the reign of arbitrariness and
unruliness have given the highest justice tribunal of the Nation a loss of
reputation. The role of the Court played in the latest years until recently has
reinforced it.61
Sessions Diary of the Honorable National Senate Constituted in Tribunal. Tomo VI, 1947: 29.

The Deputies went to great lengths to tie the impeachment of the court not only to their
denial of reform but to their duplicity in passively accepting the fraud perpetuated by the
Conservatives in the 1930s. Not surprisingly, Congress impeached the accused Justices.
Naturally, Peron replaced them with Justices who favored his agenda. The impeachment
proceedings represented the last hurdle for Peron to change the institutional trajectory of
Argentina.62 The trajectory, as we argued earlier, was set in motion with the coup in 1930 and the
subsequent electoral fraud. Nevertheless, Peron embarked on a different property rights trajectory
and certainly cemented the erosion of checks and balances. Following the impeachment, the
Peronists began to craft a new Constitution which they submitted for approval in 1949. Without a
backstop of an independent judiciary, and a new constitution in hand the Peronists were able to
have their way until the next military coup in 1955.63

61

Naturally the speech by Decker was biased but nevertheless the countenance of fraud was used as a
justification for the impeachment Report from the Deputies Chamber to the Senate accusing the Supreme
Court members.
62
“Peron’s success in ridding himself of his opponents on the Supreme Court had clear and immediate
repercussions for his ability to govern as he saw fit. The newly appointed court did little to challenge
Peron’s harassment of his political opponents. … the long term effect of the impeachments was to
introduce the informal institution of giving incoming regime leaders the prerogative to retain or remove the
sitting judges. Whereas prior to 1947 the norm had been to respect secure judicial tenure, after Peron
incoming governments could expect to remove the justices appointed by their predecessor’s regime with
very little effort.” Helmke, 2005, 64-65.
63
The U.S. confronted a similar turning point in its institutional history but the electorate in 1896 came
down on the side of maintaining the independence of the Supreme Court. In the election of 1896, the
Supreme Court was under assault and one of its Republican defenders presaged the future of Argentina:
"There are two places in this country where all men are absolutely equal: One is the ballot-box and the

28

The Aftermath of the Impeachment
After the impeachment process and new constitution, Argentina has never been able to
return to the transitional path of 1914 to 1930, one which was cultivating a belief in a system of
checks and balances. Beliefs in the legitimacy of the system matter in order to prevent short-run
opportunistic behavior. The impeachment of the Court could be viewed as the culmination of the
departure from the road towards a true system of checks and balances that was started by the coup
of 1930 but burrowed into the beliefs of constituents with the decade of fraud during the 1930s.
The legacy of Peron is one of political instability, which in turn generated sudden
changes in economic policies and institutions. As can be seen in Figure 4 the tenure of Supreme
Court Justices and regimes are co-linear after Peron; successive military and civilian governments
appointed their own Supreme Court Justices in order to accomplish their political goals. But,
without an independent court as a backstop, institutional volatility went hand in glove with
changes in administrations. Though the Supreme Court is not held in high regard, each
government apparently believes that the court poses some obstacle to their goals or they would
not bother to change the composition of the Court. Examples of the institutional volatility are
abundant: The military government in 1955 removed all the Justices of the Supreme Court and
nullified the Peronist constitutional reform of 1949 by a simple Decree. In 1958 the new
Democratic President replaced most of the Justices of the Court and introduced two new Justices.
Successive governments frequently either forced judges to resign or impeached them.

In Appendix A we show all of the changes in Supreme Court Justices before and after
Peron’s Presidency. Until Peron, no Justices had been impeached or “forced” to resign. Following
Peron, only 5 of the 58 changes in Justices has been due to death or retirement. Prior to Peron,
governments appointed a new Justice approximately every two years. After Peron, governments
appointed a new Justice every 11 months. An alternative measure of instability is tenure: prePeron tenure of Justices was nearly 10 years while in the post-Peron years tenure has fallen to
approximately 6 years (See Table VI). Oscillations between military and democratic governments
matched the instability of the court.

Furthermore, the political and institutional instability was closely related to abrupt changes in
economic policy and the rules of the game. Before the 1940s, abrupt changes in nominal
exchange rate followed international shocks and the government response to those shocks.
However, after 1940s, the biggest changes in exchange rates are due to changes in government:
the switching from military coups to democratic governments, which are coupled with changes in
the Supreme Court. This instability on the exchange rate policy can be also related to instability
on other indicators related to government policy. Post-war monetary policy became more
unstable, with higher rates of inflation, which led to hyperinflations (See Table VII).

The confidence of the public in the banking system declined, as shown by the lower
levels of M3/GDP. Overall, the government ran higher budget deficits, which produced high
levels of debt and long periods of default. Finally, the economy became more closed to
international trade and the level of foreign investment turned almost insignificant in terms of
GDP. As it is well documented, this instability hurt growth performance in the economy (Tomassi
and Spiller, 2004); and Prados de la Escosura and Sanz-Villarroya (2004). The only time when
the branches of government - Executive, Legislative and Judicial - were moving towards the
Constitutional ideal of checks and balances was the period 1912-30. After the military coup of
1930, instead of returning to open democracy the conservative elite resorted to fraud in order to
stay in office and dictate economic policy. This must have shaped the belief systems of the
citizens of Argentina towards a desire for populist rule. The Conservatives may be given high
marks for economic policy but their short-sightedness gave rise to oscillations between
democratic/populist and conservative/military governments.

V. Concluding Remarks
The government of Argentina is given high marks for the policies that they implemented
to fight the Great Depression. Unfortunately, to stay in office the Conservative governments in
the 1930s engaged in electoral fraud. The fraud was no secret and was labeled “Patriotic Fraud.”
Despite denunciations by the Radical Party in the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate and the
President openly condoned the fraud, while the Supreme Court stood passively on the sidelines.
By eroding the still developing beliefs for checks and balances by citizens, the fraud kindled a
desire for populism. The electoral fraud ended with a military coup in 1943, followed by a narrow
Presidential victory by the populist Colonel Peron. To achieve their goal of redistributing land
and income to rural tenants, and to finance populist policies and industry, the Peronists passed
legislation controlling rents and forcing owners to sell their land to tenants. Undoubtedly, an
independent Supreme Court backed by a popular belief in checks and balances would have
declared the legislation unconstitutional. But, the Peronists had no fear of their legislation being
overturned. They impeached four of the five Supreme Court Justices on the grounds of
sanctioning illegitimate governments in the 1930s, and obstructing legislation favoring urban and
rural workers during the military rule of the mid-1940s. Naturally, the Peronists replaced the
impeached Justices with appointees favoring the redistributive policies of the Peronists.
Like their Conservative predecessors who engaged in electoral fraud, the Peronists
believed that the ends justified the means. The policies of the Peronists further eroded the
possibility of achieving a government grounded in the belief of a system of checks and balances.
The aftermath has been economic and political instability. Argentina is a dramatic lesson for
developing countries; it was on the path of solving the coordination problem in which the
political actors refrain from acting in their short-run interests. During the Great Depression,
Argentina strayed from the path of consolidating democracy within a legitimate system of checks
and balances by engaging in electoral fraud. Unfortunately, Argentina has yet to find its way
back.
