Do Private Prisons Affect Criminal Sentencing?

NBER Working Paper No. 25715

JEL No. D72,H76,K0,K14,K41
ABSTRACT
Using a newly constructed complete monthly panel of private and public state prisons, we ask
whether private prisons impact judges’ sentencing decisions in their state. We employ two
identification strategies, a difference-in-difference strategy comparing court-pairs that straddle
state-borders, and an event study. We find that the opening of private prisons has a large effect on
sentence lengths shortly after opening but this effect dissipates once the prison is at capacity.
Public prison openings have no such effects, suggesting that private prisons have an impact on
criminal sentencing that public ones do not.

Introduction

Of the fourteen candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in December 2019,
twelve had explicit platforms to eliminate all private prisons, a position also shared by the Clinton campaign in the 2016 race.1 This unified position is explained by two primary concerns that
override the appeal of private prisons’ lower costs of incarceration. The first concern is that private
prisons shirk on non-contractible dimensions of quality, e.g. lower-quality rehabilitation programs
which lead to higher rates of recidivism (Inspector General, 2016; Eisen, 2017). The second concern is that private prisons may have a negative impact on the application of justice or on judicial
institutions (Mattera, Khan, LeRoy, and Davis, 2001; Ashton and Petteruti, 2011; Shapiro, 2011;
Hartney and Glesmann, 2012; Mason, 2012). In its most deleterious form, this concern was manifested in the 2011 “kids for cash” scandal, in which two Pennsylvania judges took bribes from
private detention facilities in exchange for harsher juvenile sentences.2
While the first concern has been analyzed both theoretically (Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1997)
and empirically (Bayer and Pozen, 2005; Thomas, 2005; Spivak and Sharp, 2008; Mukherjee, 2019),
the second concern has not yet been the subject of any causally identified empirical analysis. Our
study provides the first rigorous analysis of this question — whether private prisons impact sentencing decisions — based on a newly constructed monthly panel dataset of the geo-location and
capacity of the universe of all private and public state prisons from 1980 to today. We combine
these data with newly collected data on criminal sentencing in thirteen states’ trial courts.3 We
focus on state trial courts because, unlike federal courts, convicts from state courts are sent to the
same state’s prisons. Furthermore, trial courts are the states’ primary courts of general jurisdiction, and as such handle the vast majority of all criminal cases in the U.S.
We pursue two identification strategies: The first emphasizes unobserved spatial heterogeneity that may correlate with both criminal sentencing and capacity changes of private prisons. In
a generalized difference-in-difference strategy, we rely on within-state changes in private-prison

The growth of the private prison system in the last three decades has coincided with a huge increase in the U.S.
prison population: in the roughly three decades since the first private prison in the U.S. opened in 1984, the imprisoned population has increased by 194 percent relative to a general population increase of 36 percent (Bureau of Justice
Statistics, 1984, 2015).

Data on state-court sentencing is handled by each state separately, many of whom have not digitized their data
yet. Obtaining data for 13 states was the result of a three year process of requesting data from every single state.

capacity (driven by openings, closings, expansions, contractions or occasionally privatizations of
public prisons), and on comparing changes in sentencing only within neighboring trial court pairs
on either side of a state border. By focusing only on such contiguous-border court-pairs (CBCP), we
are able to account for local heterogeneity and local unobserved trends in criminal activity, policing, and the local demand for sentencing.4 The first strategy identifies the opening and closing of
private and public prisons, as well as (more continuous as well as more frequent) capacity expansions and contractions of existing facilities. Our second strategy is an event study analysis that
focuses on the monthly time path of sentencing effects around only openings and closings of prisons, because these are the largest and most salient shocks to prison bed capacity. Our data contain
40 private prison openings including three privatizations of public prisons, 13 private prison closings, 42 public prison openings, and 27 public prison closings (exclusive of three privatizations).
In the CBCP strategy, a 0.40 percent increase in private prison capacity (the average associated with a newly opened prison in the data) increases sentence lengths in that state’s courts by
roughly one percent, or 14 days, compared to adjacent courts that are in neighboring states and
not affected by the prison capacity change. The effect is robust to many variations of spatial, time,
and judge fixed effects. The baseline effect includes probations (zero-sentences) and thus combines the intensive margin of sentence length with the extensive margin of going to prison. When
we drop probation observations, the intensive margin effect of a 0.40 percent increase in private
prison capacity is an increase in sentence length of 10 days. We find no such effect of capacity
changes in public prisons on sentencing.
While the effects estimated in the CBCP strategy are averaged over the full post-period of all
prison capacity changes, the event study investigates the more granular time-path of sharp events
of prison openings and closings. The event study setup shows that the opening of a private prison
leads to an increase in sentence length of over three months in the first two months after the
opening, but a precisely estimated zero-effect thereafter.
In other words, defendants who happen to stand trial shortly after a private prison opens
can expect to be sentenced to three additional months relative to otherwise identical defendants
who stand trial for the same crime a few weeks earlier or later. A back-of-the-envelope calculation
4
The identification-advantages of state border discontinuities have been explored, among others, in the context of
labor market regulation (Dube, Lester, and Reich, 2010), manufacturing (Holmes, 1998), and banking (Huang, 2008).

shows that it takes two-and-a-half months for new convictions in a states’ courts to fill the capacity
of the average newly opened private prison. In short, private prisons appear to have an effect on
sentencing precisely as long as they have vacant capacity.
There are no pre-trends in sentencing before a private (or public) prison is opened. Interestingly, however, private prison closings are preceded by a strong negative pre-trend (sentences
getting shorter), which may be anticipatory: defendants are not sent to facilities that are closing
soon. There are no such pre-trends before public prison closings. Finally, public prison openings
and closings have precisely estimated zero-effects on sentencing, despite being very similar in
magnitude (i.e., average capacity change) to private prison ones.
How, then, do private prisons impact judges’ sentencing decisions? There are two potential
explanations. The first—more deleterious— explanation is that private prison companies may
directly influence judges, for example through campaign contributions or even outright bribes
as in the “kids for cash” scandal. A second possibility is that judges internalize the cost-savings
associated with private prisons, consistent with other evidence that judges trade off benefits of
longer sentences (primarily lowered recidivism) against their fiscal burden (Ouss, 2018; MuellerSmith and Schnepel, 2019).5 The cost-savings motive resonates particularly with the core effect
being concentrated in the two months after a prison’s opening because most states guarantee
private prisons to pay for an occupancy of between three-quarters to ninety percent of their bed
capacity (In the Public Interest, 2013), effectively reducing the marginal fiscal burden of an inmate
to zero up to this guaranteed occupancy.
We can measure cost savings from state laws governing private prison contracts. We find
that private prisons indeed have more pronounced effects on sentencing when their cost-savings
are larger (which should also reduce rents from direct influence), both in the CBCP difference-indifference identification strategy and in the event study.
A ‘direct influence’ channel of private prisons to judges is inherently more difficult to measure.
However, the literature on ‘electoral sentencing cycles’ suggests an indirect test for such influence.
It shows that electoral competition leads judges to levy harsher sentences in the lead-up to elections (Huber and Gordon, 2004; Berdejó and Yuchtman, 2013; Dippel and Poyker, 2019; Abrams,
Galbiati, Henry, and Philippe, 2019). The presence of such cycles implies that ‘direct influence’ by
5

Of course, judges may also internalize the costs to defendants.

3

private prisons should be most important when judges are seeking re-election (by way of campaign contributions). This suggests the testable hypothesis that under the ‘direct-influence’ story,
private prisons should have more pronounced effects on sentencing when judges are coming up
for re-election. We find considerable evidence for the presence of ‘electoral sentencing cycles’ in
our data, but we find no evidence that the effect of private prisons on sentencing varies with these
cycles. Overall, the evidence is thus more consistent with the cost-savings explanation than with
the direct-influence explanation fore the main effect we document.
Our paper contributes to a literature on judicial decision making, and in particular the “extralegal considerations” of judges (Posner 2008, p8-11). Amongst these are the fiscal costs of incarceration (Ouss, 2018), prisons’ capacity constraints (Mueller-Smith and Schnepel, 2019), defendants’
race (Steffensmeier and Demuth, 2000; Abrams, Bertrand, and Mullainathan, 2012; Park, 2014),
media scrutiny (Lim, Silveira, and Snyder, 2016), judges’ own characteristics like gender, ethnicity
and party affiliation (Lim and Snyder, 2015; Lim, Snyder, and Strömberg, 2015), their re-election
concerns (Huber and Gordon, 2004; Berdejó and Yuchtman, 2013; Abrams et al., 2019), and even
their emotions on the day (Eren and Mocan, 2018). We show that the presence of private prisons needs be added to the list of extra-legal considerations, and that their impact is most likely
explained by judges’ considering the fiscal costs of incarceration.6 Although a ‘direct influence’ effect would be yet more deleterious, the ‘costs savings motive’ on its own also raises serious equity
concerns about the effect of private prisons on the application of justice in U.S. courts.
There is a closely related literature on the consequences of judicial decision making for defendant outcomes (Kling, 2006; Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2013; Galasso and Schankerman, 2014;
Aizer and Doyle Jr, 2015; Dobbie, Goldin, and Yang, 2018; Mueller-Smith and Schnepel, 2019; Norris, Pecenco, and Weaver, 2019; Bhuller, Dahl, Løken, and Mogstad, 2020).7 In this literature, we
relate closely to Mukherjee (2019). Focusing on Mississippi, and using changes in private prison
6
Galinato and Rohla (2018) investigate the same question as us through the lens of a game-theoretic model, in which
judges care about prison capacity constraints as well as bribes from private prisons. They provide evidence in favor of
the direct influence mechanism but they lack a plausible identification strategy and the right data, because they use an
“off the shelf” sample of federal criminal trials from the federal U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC). Like us, they relate
sentence length to the presence of private prisons in the same state, but this approach is not valid in the USSC data
because (i) there is no spatial relation between the location of a federal court and where in the federal prison system a
convict is sent to, and because (ii) the USSC includes no data on a crime’s severity and the defendant’s criminal history.
7
For identification, most of these papers use judge fixed effects coupled with random assignment of judges to cases.
Because of the need to link sentencing data to other defendant outcome data, these papers typically use data on just a
single county or at most one state. In contrast, we use data for 13 states.

capacity over time as an instrument for whether an individual serves time in a private prison,
Mukherjee finds that this increases a convict’s total time incarcerated (holding fixed the sentence)
because private prison inmates receive more infractions, thus delaying parole. This pro-longed
incarceration wipes out half the savings from the lower cost of private prisons. Concerningly,
Mukherjee finds that longer incarceration in private prisons does not reduce recidivism upon release, which runs counter to existing evidence that longer incarceration does in general reduce
recidivism (Owens, 2009; Kuziemko, 2013; Hansen, 2015; Bhuller et al., 2020). This is explained
by the lower quality of rehabilitation programs in private prisons, providing prima facie evidence
for the concern originally formalized in Hart et al. (1997). Mukherjee’s and our findings amplify
one another with regards to equity concerns because they suggest that defendants who happen to
stand trial shortly after a private prison opens can expect to not only receive longer sentences but
also serve a larger portion of these sentences, while potentially receiving lower-quality rehabilitative programs.

Data Sources and Construction of Samples

2.1

Prison Data

The U.S. private prison industry began in the early 1980s, when the rising cost of state-run prisons
started becoming a fiscal problem for state governments.8 The first privately run corrections facility, Hamilton County Jail in Tennessee, was opened in 1984 (visible in the top-panel of Figure 1).
It was run by Corrections Corporation of America’s (CCA). Only a year later, CCA proposed to take
over the entire prison system of Tennessee. This did not happen, but 1984 nonetheless marked the
start of a rapid expansion of the private prison industry.
The monthly panel dataset of private and public state prisons we use in this paper was constructed from several sources. First, we use the 2005, 2000, 1995, 1990, and 1985 Census of State
and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities. Those censuses record for all U.S. prisons when they
opened, whether they are private or public, their capacity (measured in beds) and when it was
changed, and if they house male, female, or both convicts. We focus only on state prisons. We
8

There was a 19th century history of private prisons in the United States dating back to the first private prison’s
establishment in San Quentin in 1852. See (McKelvey, 1936, ch.1-2).

then used each state’s Departments of Correction website to update the base data to include prisons after 2005.9 The top-panel of Figure 1 displays the evolution of PrivateCct and PublicCct , i.e.,
the capacity (in beds) of private and public prisons, in Tennessee. Capacity can change because
of the expansion, contraction or closing of existing facilities, or the opening of new ones. Bigger
capacity changes (above 200 beds) are almost always the result of openings or closings. The time
range is determined by the availability of the sentencing data, which we discuss next.

2.2

The Sentencing Data

We focus on state trial courts’ sentencing decisions in felony offenses.10 Private prisons in our data
are for male prisoners only, and we therefore focus our analysis on the effect of male prisons on the
sentencing of male defendants (which generates a natural placebo exercise of looking at sentences
of female defendants). Each state maintains their own sentencing data, and we separately requested these data from every states’ Sentencing Commissions and Departments of Corrections.
Many states do not maintain an organized electronic repository of their court cases, or do not
share it. Nonetheless, we were able to obtain sentencing data from 15 states: Alabama, Arkansas,
Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. Obtaining these data from each state separately
took several years and the process was quite idiosyncratic. Online Appendix A.2 provides details on how we obtained the sentencing data in each state. Colorado and Minnesota are the only
states in our data that do not have a neighboring state within the sample, which reduces the effective number of states to 13 in our contiguous-border court-pairs (CBCP) identification strategy.
The bottom-panel of Figure 1 shows these 13 states (in light blue) as well as the counties on their
borders (in dark blue), which are discussed in Section 2.3.

2.3

Border-Pair Sample Construction

Why prison-capacity changes are state-wide changes:

The location of prisons, both public and

private is determined in state legislatures. Locations are selected with economic considerations in
mind, typically in structurally weak areas and with a view towards providing local employment

This excludes courts of limited jurisdiction, such as family courts and traffic courts, and, excludes crimes of minor
severity amongst the courts of general jurisdiction.

Panel B: Sentencing Data Map

Notes: The top-panel shows the evolution of the capacity of private and public prisons in Tennessee. The dashed (red)
line is the state-specific time-series of public prison capacity (number of beds). The solid (blue) line is the state-specific
time-series of private prison capacity (number of beds). The time range in each state is determined by sentencing data
availability. In Figure 1, Tennessee has openings in 1984, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2016. The figure includes the opening
of the very first privately operated state-run prison in Tennessee’s Hamilton County in 1984. As an added point of
comparison, Online Appendix Figure 1 shows the equivalent data for Mississippi, where the data displays essentially
the same variation Figure 1 in Mukherjee (2019). The bottom-panel shows the 13 states (in light blue) in our sample,
and the 252 border-counties thin this sample (in dark blue).

opportunities (Mattera et al. 2001, p.7, Chirakijja 2018, p.6). Often such structurally weak areas
actively compete in lobbying the state legislature for the construction of a prison (private or public) in their county. For example, Mattera et al. (2001, p.22) recounts how the collapse of the oil
boom in the late 90s, and the resulting dearth of local jobs, was a driving factor in allocating the
construction of an Oklahoma private prison to the town of Hinton. Similar examples abound in
the same and in other sources. The location of a newly opened prison is therefore endogenous to
local factors that could also impact local crime and therefore sentencing. This implies that using a
court’s distance to a private prison as a source of variation is endogenous, despite its intuitive.11
Once we think of PrivateCct and PublicCct as state-level changes, the contiguous-border court-pair
(CBCP) sample offers the cleanest spatial comparison because it is amenable to non-parametrically
controlling for unobserved local trends (Dube et al., 2010; Holmes, 1998; Huang, 2008).12 In our
setting, this means trends in criminal activity, policing and in the local electorate’s demand for
sentencing. Trial court districts in our data are always the same as counties. Our CBCP identification sample therefore consists of all the county-pairs in our data that straddle a state border.
This amounts to 252 border counties out of of total of 417 counties in our 13 states. These border
counties are mapped to 237 distinct county-pairs.
We provide a detailed breakdown of the number of counties and pairs on each state-border
segment in Online Appendix Table 1. This table clarifies how many border-segments are linked
to each state, and also reports on the years covered by each state’s sentencing data, with varying coverage of the years 1980 to 2017. While the advantages of border-discontinuities in terms
of statistical identification do not really depend on this, the generalizability of the results will be
higher if the border counties are representative of all counties in a state on observable characteristics. Online Appendix Table 2 shows that the socio-economic characteristics of border-court
counties are not statistically different from all other counties in the same states. Further, Online
Appendix Figure 3 provides an illustration of the identifying variation in a border-segment, using
as an example the border-segment shared by Georgia and Tennessee.
11
For completeness, we do report regressions where the treatment is a distance-weighted sum of private prison
capacities in a state in Online Appendix Table 4.
12
See Dube et al. (2010) for a taxonomy of the differences between identifying the effect of state-level policy changes
in a “full sample” of all counties vs identifying the same changes in a border-county sample.

The Effect of Private Prisons on Criminal Sentencing

Section 3.1 presents the results of the generalized difference-in-difference estimation strategy in
the CBCP sample described in Section 2.3, where we regress sentence length on changes in private
and public prison capacity, as well as defendant and crime characteristics. In Section 3.2, we focus
only on sharp openings and closings of private and public prisons in an event study framework.
Section 3.3 provides suggestive evidence on the mechanisms.

3.1

The Effect of Private Prisons on Sentencing

The empirical specification we will estimate is
log(sentence)i(ct) = β T ·log(PrivateC)st +β T’ ·log(PublicC)st +β X ·Xi +µs +µp(c) +µst +µp(c)t +icts ,
(1)
where case i is heard in court c at time t. We use log(·) as shorthand for the inverse hyperbolic sin
which can be interpreted in the same way as the log function but allows us to keep zero values in
private prison capacity.13 Xi are characteristics of the crime and of the defendant.
The CBCP design is reflected in the combination of a state fixed effect µs that absorbs fixed
state-differences in the police, legislation and judicial system, and a court-pair fixed effect µp(c)
that absorbs local social, political and economic conditions. Separate time trends or period fixed
effects µst and µp(c)t are specific to these separate spatial aggregates.
Panel A in Table 1 presents the baseline results of estimating equation (1). Specifications get incrementally more demanding across columns: Column I reports results for the specification with
(time-invariant) court-pair fixed effects µp(c) and state-specific year- and fiscal-year fixed effects
µst .14 Column II adds defendant characteristics subsumed in Xi . In particular, we include for a
dummy for recidivism, age, age squared, and race (Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Native American).
Column III adds controls the severity of the crime, also subsumed in Xi .15 Column IV uses pairspecific year fixed effects as a more flexible version of µp(c)t . Finally, column V adds pair-specific
13

See Burbidge, Magee, and Robb (1988); Card and DellaVigna (2017).
Calendar years are important because legislation (which can affect sentencing) usually changes on the 1st of January. Fiscal years are important because many transfer programs that can affect crime (like Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Programs) change with fiscal years. Fiscal years in our data end on March 31st, June 30th or September 30th.
15
States report crime severity in varying ways, using ordinal scales or cardinal scales. To combine these different
classification schemes into a single regression we turn them into state-specific sets of fixed effects.

time controls µp(c)t in the form of a pair-specific linear trend that increments in months. Finally,
column VI adds a specification with judge fixed effects. Unfortunately, we only have judge identifiers in nine of the 13 states’ sentencing data.16 Nonetheless, judge fixed effects are an important
robustness check given the large “judge fixed effect” literature. It is reassuring that judge fixed
effects add considerably to the regressions’ R-squared but do not move our coefficient of interest.
A 0.42 percent increase in private prison capacity (equal the average state-wide capacity increase
from a newly opened prison in our data) increases sentence lengths by roughly 14 days (a roughly
one-percent increase, 0.42 × 0.023, multiplied by a mean sentence length of 45 months) compared
to adjacent courts that are in neighboring states and not affected by the prison capacity change.
This point estimate is precisely estimated and also practically unchanged in magnitude across
columns. In contrast, the point estimate on PublicCst is never close to conventional statistical significance.
Panel A combines potential effects of private prisons at the intensive margin (longer sentences)
and at the extensive-margin (being sent to prison). In Panel B, we isolate the intensive margin
by dropping cases that received probation.17 As expected, the point estimate is smaller for only
the intensive margin, but it remains equally stable across columns and is even more precisely
estimated than in Panel A. On the intensive margin alone, a 0.42 percent increase in private prison
capacity increases sentence lengths by roughly 10 days (a 0.42 × 0.013 increase, multiplied by a
mean sentence length of 60 months). Panel C isolates the extensive margin. The point estimate
follows from the composition of the total effect (0.023) into its intensive- and extensive margins
(0.013 + 0.002 × log(60)). It is, however, very imprecisely estimated.
Figure 2 verifies that our results are not driven by just one state or a small set of states. Dropping one state at a time, the estimated coefficient always stays close to the baseline estimate and
always remains statistically significant. Dropping either of Alabama or Tennessee cuts the coefficient in half, but also increases its precision considerably.18 The reason for this is that the bordersegments of Alabama and Tennessee come closest to generating an extensive margin effect on the
probability of going to prison, which is part of the total effect estimated in the data with probations
16

In states without judge identifiers we use the court fixed effect as a placeholder.
Online Appendix Figure 4 displays the distribution of sentence lengths with and without probations.
18
Dropping Alabama drops three border-segments from the analysis (with Mississippi, Georgia, and Tennessee).
Dropping Tennessee drops seven of the 17 border-segments in Online Appendix Table 1.

Notes: This figure reports on the point-estimate and 95th-percent confidence band that results when re-estimating the
specification in Column VI of Table 1, dropping one state at a time. The (red) vertical line is the baseline point estimate.
The results are sorted top-to-bottom in alphabetical order, i.e., omit AL, then AR, then GA, etc.

(see Online Appendix Figure 5). When we focus on the intensive margin only in the right panel, the
effect of dropping Alabama or Tennessee is much less pronounced.
Online Appendix Table 3 reports on a number of additional validity checks that ensure the
results in Table 1 are not driven by confounding factors: We show no effect on female defendents
(almost all private prisons in our data are for male prisoners only), and we show results insignificant when we counter-factually shift the time of all changes in private prison capacity by 9, 6, or
3 months. For completeness, we also report the full sample results in panels D–E. The estimated
coefficients are sign consistent but much smaller and usually not near conventional statistical significance levels. Finally, Online Appendix Table 4 reports on regressions where treatment is a
state’s distance-weighted sum of private prison capacities. Results fall in between CBCP and full
sample in magnitude and significance, but are subject to serious endogeneity concerns; see Section 2.3.

3.2

Event Study Evidence

The results in Section 3.1 identify the smaller (and more frequent) capacity changes of existing
facilities in addition to the sharper capacity changes associated with the opening and closing of
prisons. In this section, we focus only on prison openings and closings because these are the

12

largest shocks to prison bed capacity (and should be the most salient to judges).19 Our data contain 40 private prison openings including three privatizations of public prisons, 13 private prison
closings, 42 public prison openings, and 27 public prison closings (exclusive of the three privatizations). The regression we run is

yi(ct)k =

where yi(ct)k is sentence-length of case i inside event window k, and λk is a fixed effect for event
k. We slice the sentencing data into 12-month observation-windows (6 months before and after each
event). All observation windows are then pooled. Following best practice, we bin the end-points
using an effect window of 8 month, so that the fourth to sixth months before and after events each
share a coefficient (Borusyak and Jaravel, 2016; Schmidheiny and Siegloch, 2019).20
Figure 3 in its top-panel reports histograms of the 40 private prison and 42 public prison openings. Capacity changes associated with these two event-types are very similar in magnitude. The
means are respectively 1,150 and 1,200. Any differences in estimated effects on sentencing across
the two event types is therefore not likely to be driven by the events’ magnitudes. The mediumpanel is the core-result, comparing the effect of private prison openings on the left and public
prison openings on the right. The first note-worthy feature is that neither type of opening exhibits
any pre-trends. This suggests the exact timing of the openings is not related to trends in crime
or in sentencing. It is also consistent with the fact that although a prison opening is known long
in advance, there is no reason for sentencing to respond before it actually does open. The second
noteworthy feature is that there no effect at all of public prison openings, but a notable effect of
private prison openings, and it is concentrated in the first two months after the opening. Sentence lengths are increased by 3.7 months in the first months after an opening, and by 3 months
in the second month after an opening. These point estimates are much more pronounced than
the 14 day estimate implied in Panel A in Table 1. This is because the generalized difference-indifference specification (1) averages the effect over an openings’ full post-period and therefore
19

The average change associated with prison openings or closings is 1,150 beds.
An observation-window of 12 months and effect window of 8 months imply that {l, ¯
l} = {−4, +4}, and that γ−4 is
identified using sentences in t = {−6, −5, −4}, and γ4 using sentences in t = {4, 5, 6}, away from event k’s date Eik .

does not capture the time path of the effect.
The narrowly concentrated effect we find makes sense from the perspective of average event’s
magnitude: a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that it would take two-and-a-half months
worth of convictions to fill the capacity of the average newly opened private prison if every convict
in a state was sent there after its opening. In short, private prisons appear to have an effect on
sentencing precisely as long as they have vacant capacity.
The bottom panel reports results from the same setup, but comparing the results of closings.
There is again neither a pre-trend or effect for public prisons. There is, however, a notable pretrend for private prisons. This is consistent with the fact that closings are anticipated. Unlike with
openings, which are of course also anticipated, sentencing may respond in anticipation to closings
because new inmates are unlikely to be sent to prisons that are about to close.

3.3

Evidence on Mechanisms

One potential explanation for an effect of prison expansions on sentence lengths could be that
judges consider prison capacity per se. For example, Mueller-Smith and Schnepel (2019) argue
that over-crowding drives prosecutors and judges to “divert” people from criminal prosecution.
However, a capacity explanation for the effects we find is inconsistent with the effect being concentrated in only private prisons because there are as many new public prison openings in our
data as private ones, and they are of similar magnitude.21
This leaves two primary explanations. One is the sort of ‘judicial capture’ suggested by the
“kids for cash” scandal, i.e., private prison companies may directly influence judges to levy longer
sentences. A second is that judges internalize the cost-savings associated with incarceration in
private prisons. To make progress on this question, we need direct measures for the two distinct
mechanisms. We can measure the cost of private relative to public prisons because in most states
these are written into the laws governing the contracting with private prisons.22 We define the
(per bed) savings rate from private prisons as

Savings = 1 −

Cost in private prisons
.
Cost in public prisons

21

(3)

Online Appendix Table 9 shows that our results are not driven by over-crowding.
When they are not legislated, we take the measures from reported savings. We check the robustness of results to
capping reported savings at 20 percent. Details in Online Appendix A.3.

Table 2: Cost Savings Motives vs Judicial Capture

In the states that include judge identifiers we follow the electoral cycle literature (Huber and Gordon, 2004; Berdejó and Yuchtman, 2013) in defining judge j’s election cycles as a linear running
variable ‘proximity to election’
PtEj(s)t = t/Ts ,

(4)

that starts at 0 on the day after a general election, is scaled from 0 to 1, and increases by 1/Ts each
day until it equals 1 on the day of the next general election.23 With these measure in hand, we
estimate the following extension of expression (1)
Sentencei(jct) = β T · PrivateCst + βCS · PrivateCst · Savings
+ βP tE · PtEjt + βDI · PtEjt · PrivateCst

(5)

+ β T” · PublicCst + β X · Xi + µs + µp(c) + µst + µj + µp(c)t + icts ,
d
where β T and β T” are the same as before, β
CS > 0 would be evidence for the cost-savings hypothec
sis, βd
PtE > 0 indicates the presence of electoral sentencing cycles, and βDI > 0 would be evidence
for the direct-influence hypothesis.
Expression (5) nests specifications where we check the two mechanisms. In columns I–V of
Table 2 we test for the cost-savings mechanisms by omitting βP tE · PtEjt + βDI · PtEjt · PrivateCst .
In columns I–III we use the CBCP sample. Column I is the same as column XI in Panel A of
Table 1, except the outcome is in levels rather than logs.24 Columns II interacts private prisons
with the continuous cost-savings measure in expression (3), Column III instead does a binary split
that defines states with greater than five percent savings as ‘high-savings’ and those with less as
low-savings states. Both specifications suggest that the effect of private prison capacity changes is
most pronounced in states where the cost savings from private prisons are high. (We also confirm
this when we break the event-study analysis into high-savings and low-savings states in Online
Appendix Figure 8.) Columns IV–V re-estimate II–III for the full sample.
The second half of the table compares this to the evidence for judicial capture. Only the nine
states with judge identifiers in the data can be included. Further, only states where there is at
23

Ts is the length of state s’s electoral cycle, i.e., TW A = 4 × 365 in Washington where elections are every 4 years,
and TN C = 8 × 365 in North Carolina where elections are every 8 years.
24
The outcomes are in levels here because the interactions that are the regressors of interest are in levels so that the
objects of interest are not elasticities.

17

least some evidence for the electoral sentencing cycles can be included.25 This omits Colorado,
Kentucky, Minnesota, and Virginia. Column VI confirms our baseline effect in this new full sample
of five states. Column VII confirms the presence of electoral sentencing cycles, i.e., βd
PtE > 0, in this
sample. Column VIII tests for judicial capture: there is no evidence at all that sentencing cycles
are more pronounced in the presence of private prisons. In combination, the evidence in columns
II-III and VIII supports the cost savings story but not the judicial capture story. Because these
are estimated in different samples, we introduce cost savings into the electoral cycle sample in
columns IX–X. The cost-savings coefficients continue to show up significantly, while the judicial
capture coefficient continues not to.26 While this evidence on mechanisms is coarse, the observed
patterns are surprisingly robust in their support of the cost savings explanation for the effect of
private prisons on sentencing.

4

Conclusion

We study whether private prisons impact judges’ criminal sentencing decisions. We find that the
opening of a private prison has large effect on sentence lengths in the prison’s state, but only during the first two months after opening. Public prison openings have no such effects. This suggests
that private prisons have short-run effects on the application of justice that public ones do not.
This finding has considerable implications for judicial equity: defendants who happen to stand
trial shortly after a private prison opens can expect to be sentenced to three additional months
relative to otherwise identical defendants who stand trial for the same crime a few weeks earlier
or later. The equity implications of this effect are further accentuated by other research showing
that these defendants may also serve a larger portion of their sentences, with lower-quality rehabilitative care. The evidence on mechanisms is overall most consistent with the hypothesis that
judges respond to private prisons by levying longer sentences because they consider the lower
per-day per-bed fiscal cost of incarceration in their sentencing decision.

25

The presence of the electoral sentencing cycles varies considerably across states (Dippel and Poyker, 2019).
Online Appendix Table 10 shows that these insights are unchanged when we omit probations from the data. Online
Appendix Table 11 shows additional robustness checks to variations in the fixed effects reported at the bottom of the
tables.

Data Description

Prison Data

Prison-year panel dataset was constructed combining several sources. Below we provide the
description of the process of its creation.
First, we access Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities for the years of 2005,
2000, 1995, and 1990.27 From these cross-section of the universe of US correctional facilities we
construct a panel with three years only. In this panel we observe the capacity of each prison and
the year when each penitentiary is founded, and if the prison is publicly or privately managed.
As we study state prison system we omit all federal prisons from the dataset.
Second, we create observations for each prison for each year between 1990 and 1995, between
1995 and 2000, and between 2000 and 2005. By doing this we assign prison capacity values of 1990
for all years 1991 to 1994, assign prison capacity values of 1995 for years 1996 to 1999 and so on.
Then we prolong our panel to December 2016, and assign prison capacity of the 2005 for all years
starting with 2006.
Such approach has its drawbacks, and one of the most important is that prisons can disappear
or appear between the years when censi data was collected. However, if a new prison appears
e.g. in 1995 census but is not present in 1990 census we can see the year when it was opened and
correct the dataset. But if the prison was in 1990 census but disappear in 1995 census we do not
know exactly when it was closed. There are few cases when prison was closed and we manually
checked the dates when they were closed and augmented the dataset.28
Third, as we can not observe if new prisons were opened after 2005, we use states’ Department
of Correction sites to add new prisons in the dataset.
Forth, as our main treatment comes from the private prisons, we treated the subsample of
private prisons specially. In particular, we studied sites of all the private prison companies and
collected yearly prison capacity data for 1990-2016.29 In addition, if prison was privatized it may
appear as public e.g. in 2000 and remain public until 2005 in our data even if it was privatized
at 2001. Thus by walking through all US private prisons one-by-one we adjust the dummies for
being private prison in our dataset. Similarly we check if private prison switched from hosting
federal (state) to hosting state (federal) prisoners in between the prison censuses.
Finally, we geo-locate latitude and longitude data of each prison location using the Google
Maps API.
27

These datasets are publicly available at ICPSR. Their codes are 24642.
In particular we used dataset of prisons available at ENIGMA (https://app.enigma.io/table/enigma.
prisons.all-facilities?row=0&col=0&page=1). That cross-sectional dataset contains data about all ever existing correctional facilities in the US. While it does not contain the year when the prison was founded it contains the
year when it was closed and we used it to find closed prisons.
29
In comparison with public prison that have prison capacity variable change only at 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 or later
(if opened after 2005).

prison openings in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2008, and closings in 2002 and 2013. Our figure for Mississippi
is very similar to Figure 1 in Mukherjee (2019).

Sentencing Data

Sentencing data was collected separately from each state. 15 states were willing to share their
data with us for free or at reasonable cost: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky,
Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia,
and Washington. Obtaining these data from each state separately took several years and the process was quite idiosyncratic.30
We contacted each state with the following initial data request:
The data we are looking for has a court case (or ’sentencing event’) as the unit of observation. In
some states the data is organized by charge (with several charges making up the case or sentencing
event) and that is equally fine. The key data that we need are:
1. date, month and year of sentencing for
2. type of crime,
3. length of sentencing,
4. type of sentencing (low-security, high security, etc),
5. defendant’s sex,
6. defendant’s race,
7. court identifier
8. name of judge or judge identifier number,
9. type of court that convicted (trial, appeal, etc),
30

The only state with digitized sentencing data not included in our analysis is Kansas, which charged five times
more than other states for our data processing request leading us to echo Frank’s 2007 question.

Prison Costs Data

We collect information on savings from using convict labor from the multiple sources. First,
the costs of state public prisons we use data from Vera Institute of Justice.31
For private prisons we use state legislation in cast there is a mandatory requirements on the
savings: Kentucky (10%),32 Mississippi (10%),33 Tennessee (5%),34 and Texas (10%).35 We also use
data from Hakim and Blackstone (2013) and state reports and news articles to find the rest of the
information: Alabama (22%), Arkansas (48%), Georgia (16%), Nevada (55%), Virginia (1%), and
Washington (0%).36 The remaining states have no state private prisons, and thus no legislated cost
savings.

Additional Results

Online Appendix Table 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the number of pairs on each stateborder segment. This table clarifies how many border-segments are linked to each state. Tennessee, for example, is the most ‘connected’ state in our data, sharing border-segments with seven
states (segments # 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16). Online Appendix Table 1 also clarifies how many years
of sentencing data are used for each border segment: The years covered by each state’s sentencing data vary somewhat, ranging from 1980 to 2017, and the years included in a border-pair are
determined by the state with less sentencing data coverage. For example, Tennessee’s data sentencing data goes back to the 1980s. There are 26 years of data in its border-pairs with Mississippi
( segment #5 ), whose data also go back to 1990. By contrast, there are only 6 years of data in its
border-pairs with Georgia (segment #7), whose sentencing data only goes back to 2010.
The years included in a county-pair are determined by the state with less sentencing data
coverage. For example, there are 26 years of data in Tennessee’s border-segment with Mississippi,
because Mississippi’s data cover 1990–2016 and Tennessee’s cover 1980–2016.

Notes: This table decomposes the sample of 237 border-counties into 17 state-border segments. The table clarifies how
many border-segments are linked to each state, and which segments are dropped when a state is dropped from the
analysis, as the robustness check reported in Figure 2 will do. The table also clarifies what years of sentencing data are
used in each border segment, where the constraint on each segment is the state with less available sentencing data.

Notes: This table shows that the border-county sample is representative of the full sample of counties in the 13 states
we peruse. The top-panel reports on county-characteristics. The bottom-panel reports on sentencing data.

Online Appendix Table 2 shows that the socio-economic characteristics of border-court counties are not statistically different from all other counties in the same states. Column-set I reports
on border-court counties Column-set II reports the same for all other counties in the 13 states.
Reassuringly, column-set III confirms that border counties are representative of counties in their
states more broadly, the difference between the two samples is never near conventional significant
levels. In the bottom panel, we verify the same holds true for sentencing and defendant characteristics, including defendants’ race and our main dependent variable, the length of a sentence.37
The two most important characteristics of a court case are the crime’ severity and the defendant’s
recidivism. Because each state classifies these two variables into unique discrete scales, we cannot
report descriptive statistics on these.
Column-set IV reports differences between cross-border contiguous counties. It shows that
within such pairs, socio-economic characteristics of border-court do not significantly vary between
counties.
37

Sentences of length zero represent cases that the defendant was found not guilty, or sentenced to non-prison conditions (e.g., fines, probation, or community services). In the case of consecutive sentences, we summed all sentencing
within each case. In the case of concurrent sentencing, we took the maximum.

Notes: This figure shows the time variation in PrivateCct and PublicCct for two neighboring states (Georgia and Tennessee, which together form segment #7 in Table Online Appendix Table 2) over the same time horizon. The dashed
(red) line is the state-specific time-series of public prison capacity (number of beds). The solid (blue) line is the statespecific time-series of private prison capacity (number of beds).

Online Appendix Figure 3 illustrates the identifying variation across the border-segment that
connects Georgia to Tennessee. This is segment #7 in Online Appendix Table 1. Tennessee has
considerable variation in PrivateCct , as can be seen in Figure 1. However, sentencing data from
Georgia only goes back to 2010, and within the 2010 to 2016 time frame, Tennessee displays no
variation in PrivateCct . The effect of PrivateCct on courts/counties along border segment #7 is
therefore estimated by comparing the expansion in Georgia’s private prison capacity in 2011 and
again in 2012 relative to a constant capacity in Tennessee.

Panel A of Online Appendix Table 3 reports on a placebo test that ensures our results are not
driven by confounding factors. Namely, we re-estimate this baseline effect for female defendants
because private prisons in our data are almost entirely male only. Indeed, we find no effect of
expanding male private prisons on female sentencing length, making it unlikely that there is an
unobservable confounding trend that correlates with PrivateCst and that makes sentences harsher
across the board.
Panel B of Online Appendix Table 3 shifts the time-period of the treatment. With state-year
fixed effects µst included, identification of our baseline estimates in Table 1 comes from withinstate within-year variation. To check that this variation truly estimates the effect of changes in
PrivateCst , rather than within-year trends, we shift PrivateCst to month t + 3, t + 6, and t + 9, and
to month t − 3, t − 6, and t − 9, always evaluated relative to a state-specific year fixed effect.
None of the resulting estimates has a significant coefficient, which indicates that the effects are
quite concentrated around the capacity changes. This is what we further investigate in the event
study analysis.

Notes: Panel A of this Table replicates Panel A of Table 1 but uses only the sample of female defendants. In Panel B all
columns, we take the most demanding specification from the baseline results, i.e., Column VI of Panel A in Table 1. In
Columns I–III of Panel B, instead of private and public prison capacities at year-month t we use corresponding variables
at year-month t − 3, t − 6, and t − 9. In Columns IV–VI of Panel B, instead of private and public prison capacities at
year-month t we use corresponding variables at year-month t + 3, t + 6, and t + 9. In square brackets we report p-values
for standard errors are clustered on state and border segment; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Notes: This table replicates Panels D and E of Table 1, but uses prison capacities weighted by the distance from a
defendant’s court to each prison. In square brackets we report p-values for standard errors are clustered on state and
county level.*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

In Section 2.3 we argue that the location of prisons is clearly endogenous to local factors that
could also impact local crime and therefore sentencing. This implies that using a court’s distance
to a private prison as a source of variation is endogenous, despite the intuitive appeal of this
margin of variation. For completeness, Online Appendix Table 4 reports on regressions using this
endogenous distance-based measure.
Endogeneity concerns aside, conversations with officials in several states revealed that proximity seems to be anyway largely irrelevant in determining which prison a defendant is sent to.
Prisons are different from jails in this respect: jails are run by the county, and defendants awaiting
trial do so in the jail of the trial court’s county.

Notes: This replicates Panel A of Table 1 This Table replicates Panel A of Table 1 but adds the interaction of log private
prison capacities with a dummy for overcrowding in a state’s prisons. Crowding is defined as a state’s annual prison
occupancy relative to its capacity. The distribution of this ratio is depicted in Online Appendix Figure 9. We use an
indicator for over-crowing defined as D(total overcrowding) ≥ 1. Similarly, we compute overcrowding of the private
prisons (D(overcrowding in private prisons)). The capacity is the same used everywhere in the data. The occupancy
data is annual data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (Carson and Mulako-Wangota 2020). In square brackets we
report p-values for standard errors are clustered on state and border segment; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

We argue in our paper that our results are not likely to be driven by capacity or over-crowding
considerations. A capacity- or crowding-based explanation for the effects we find is inconsistent
with the effect being concentrated in only private prisons, because there are as many new public
prison openings in our data as private ones, and they are of similar magnitude. Online Appendix
Table 9 makes this point clearer, by showing that prison (over-)crowding interacts weakly and
(across columns) inconsistently with our baseline effect, and does not nullify the baseline effect of
prison capacity.

In Online Appendix Table 12, we check the robustness of the results to capping the reported
cost savings. In the case of Nevada and Arkansas, these cost savings surprisingly large (55%,
and 48%), and these are reported from local news reports (see Online Appendix A.3). In Online
Appendix Table 12, we cap these cost savings at 15% (the maximum number obtained from actual
data/estimates) and re-estimate the model. Reassuringly, the key patterns in the table are not
affected by capping the cost-savings data in this way.
