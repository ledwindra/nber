Household Responses to Public Home Care Programs
Peter C. Coyte and Mark Stabile
NBER Working Paper No. 8523
October 2001
JEL No. I1, J14

ABSTRACT
A choice-theoretic model of household decision-making with respect to care-giving time
allocations and the use of publicly and privately financed home care services is proposed. Predictions
concerning the effect of increased availability of publicly financed home care services on home care
utilization, informal care-giving, and health status are derived. These predictions are assessed through
use of Canadian inter-provincial survey data on home care use and care-giving that are matched with data
on home care funding for the period 1992 to 1998. Increased availability of publicly financed home care
is associated with an increase in its utilization and a decline in informal care-giving, with this effect more
pronounced among lower income Canadians. While self-reported health status was positively correlated
with the increased availability of publicly financed home care, the perceived need for home care was
invariant to this change.

Introduction
One of the dominant shifts in the delivery of health care over the past decade has

been in the place of care, particularly from the hospital to the home. Whereas individuals
used to spend prolonged periods in hospital for treatment and recovery, hospital stays
have dramatically decreased (or ceased altogether) and many aspects of care now take
place at home (Coyte and McKeever, 2001). An important implication of this change in
the care setting is its effect on who pays for and who delivers care. In both the United
States and Canada, hospital care provided to the elderly is explicitly covered under the
Medicare Program and the Canada Health Act, respectively. However, in-home care is
not necessarily covered by public insurance in either country. More significantly, once
outside the hospital, the onus on family and friends to assist with, or even take
responsibility for the provision (and financing) of care is greater. As such, the publicprivate financing of in-home care has become a prominent issue for health policy makers.
Despite a dramatic increase in the provision of in-home care, there are wide
variations in the services used. In many jurisdictions, under the in-home service
designation, an array of agencies and providers participate in the provision of a complex
range of health professional and lifestyle enhancement services to a variety of recipients.
The range of services is large and includes nursing, social work, physiotherapy, speech
language pathology, personal support care, audiology, occupational therapy, and meals on
wheels. While most care recipients receive these services to prevent or retard the
deterioration of health and to assist them to maintain independence in the community, others
receive a more specialized variety of rehabilitation services following hospitalization. These
services “enable clients, incapacitated in whole or in part, to live at home, often with the

1

effect of preventing, delaying, or substituting for long term or acute care alternatives”
(Health Canada, 1999).
In the last twenty-five years, Canadian public home care expenditures have
increased at an average annual compound rate of 17.4 percent from $62 million in fiscal
year 1975 to $2,096 million in fiscal year 1997 (Health Canada, 1999). This increase was
more than double the equivalent annual growth rate of 8.3 percent for total public health
spending, (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 1999) and represents an extension of
provincial health insurance to services and settings not encompassed by the principles of the
Canada Health Act. Since this Act stipulates the terms and conditions of physician and
hospital service provision that the provinces must abide by to ensure that they receive their
full share of federal transfers, the exemption of in-home services from such conditions
provide provinces with discretion in their allocation of health expenditures. Thus, while
Canadian public per capita spending on in-home services was $69, in 1997, there was
almost a three-fold variation in spending by comparing New Brunswick, Newfoundland,
Ontario and Manitoba, where per capita spending exceeded $90, to Quebec and Prince
Edward Island, where spending was less than $40 (Coyte and McKeever, 2001).
As public programs expand into what was previously a privately dominated
segment of the health system, families may alter their behavior in order to take advantage
of these public offerings. In some cases, these public offerings substitute for services that
were previously funded privately through either direct payments or time commitments by
family and friends. In other circumstances, this extension of public coverage may meet
some previously unmet need, and thereby, increase overall utilization as these services
complement existing care.

This paper investigates household responses to publicly funded programs for inhome care. The paper begins with a choice-theoretic model of household decision making
when one member requires in-home care. The paper then uses Canadian data on home
care use and care-giving matched with provincial level data on home care funding to test
the model’s implications. Our findings suggest that family behavior is consistent with the
simple economic model. Increases in the generosity of public programs affect home care
utilization and the amount of family care-giving undertaken. In addition, increases in
publicly funded in-home care are correlated with improvements in the health of home
care recipients, but perceived needs for home care are invariant to this change.
This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous literature on
public provision of in-home care and household decision-making. Section 3 outlines a
model of household decision-making that incorporates in-home care. Section 4 describes
the public home care programs in Canada. Section 5 outlines the data used in the
analysis. Section 6 outlines our empirical specification and trends in home care use.
Section 7 presents our findings with respect to health status, while Section 8 reports on
the propensity to engage in care-giving. Section 9 provides a brief conclusion.

2.0

Previous Literature
Much of the literature on the impact of public health subsidies and programs for

the elderly on care-giving, living arrangements and use of in-home services comes from
the United States. This research has focused primarily on the effects of Medicaid
reimbursement for nursing home facilities and various state level policies designed to
combat the moral hazard problem that Medicaid reimbursements may create.

3

Cutler and Sheiner (1993) examine the effect of government nursing home
policies on institutionalization rates and on the amount of care received in the
community. The authors examine both the price differential between Medicaid and the
private market, as well the ability of some higher income elderly beneficiaries to receive
Medicare support for nursing home care. They find that in states with more liberal
Medicaid rules, the higher income elderly are more likely to use a nursing home. In states
with larger underpayments the poor appear to have reduced access to nursing homes.
They find that as Medicaid support increases, informal family care decreases.
Ettner (1994) examines whether Medicaid home care benefits affect nursing home
entry and the use of formal and informal care. Home care subsidies were found to reduce
the rate of nursing home use for the elderly in need of long-term care and resulted in a
substantial replacement of informal care with formal care for non-medical services.
Pezzin et al (1996) use data from the Channeling experiment, a national
assessment of expanded public financing for in-home care conducted from 1982-851.
They found that more generous public home care programs lowered the probability that
an individual would live in a nursing home, and increased the probability that unmarried
individuals would live independently2. They found that the substitution between formal
and informal care was small, but the effect on hours of care was large and dominated the
overall effect of subsidized formal care on informal care.
Hoerger et al (1996) quantify the use of state policies that encourage the elderly to
stay in their communities. They use the National Long Term Care Survey and exploit the
1

Pezzin et al suggest seeing Kemper et al. (1988) for a description of the of the Channeling experiment.
Previous research using the Channeling Demonstration by Christianson (1988) and Woolridge and Schore
(1988), however, found only a small effect/no effect of the formal home care program on informal care or
institutionalization. Pezzin et al. argue that their result comes from modeling living and care arrangements
jointly and having examined shifts in living arrangements in the community.

variation in Medicaid State policies for formal in-home care and care in nursing homes.
They found that Medicaid subsidies affected the choice of living arrangements. A
loosening of financial requirements for Medicaid eligibility for nursing home care
increased the use of nursing homes. However, subsidizing home health services simply
increased the probability that individuals lived independently from their children rather
than affecting the probability of institutionalization.
While much of the literature has examined the effects of various policies on the
types of care received, there is little evidence of the effects of policy on the health of the
individuals receiving care. In this paper, we not only consider how provincial home care
policies affect care-giving, living arrangements and the use of in-home services, we also
examine their effects on the self-reported health status of care recipients.

3.0

A model of family home care decisions
We consider a simple model of decision making using a representative household

with both care receivers and care-givers. The purpose of the model is to determine what
testable implications arise from implementing or increasing public home care programs.
Households allocate time and financial resources subject to resource and technology
constraints. In a two-person household, where one person is a care recipient and the other
is a healthy care-giver, household utility is defined by the function:
(1)

U ( X , L, A | τ ) ,

where X represents market goods and services, L leisure time, A the ability of care
recipients to perform activities of daily living, and τ represents household preferences.
A care recipient’s performance ability is defined by the production technology:
(2)

A(M(m, m*), C | H),

5

where M is total formal home care, composed of publicly funded care up to a maximum
allocation of m, and privately financed care, m*. C is care-giving time performed by the
other family member, and H is the care recipient’s health status.
Time and financial constraints are satisfied if:
(3)

PxX + Pm* + (P – s)m = V + W(T – L – C),

where Px is the unit cost of X, P is the unit cost of private care, m*, (P-s) is the unit outof-pocket cost of public care, m, s is the unit subsidy for public care, V is non-wage
income, W is the unit cost of time, and finally, T is the total time for leisure, care-giving
and labor market work.
To simplify the household decision problem, we assume that public and private
in-home care are perfect substitutes, so that equation (2) may be re-written as:
(2’)

A(M, C | H ) ,

where M is now just the sum of public and private care. Consequently, the household’s
resource constraint, equation (3), may be re-written as:
(3’)

Px X + PM + WC = V + W (T − L) + sm .

The household then maximizes utility, equation (1), by selecting M, C, and L subject to
technology, equation (2’), and resource, equation (3’), constraints.
The household’s optimization problem can be broken down into three stages.
First, the household selects performance ability, A*, where the marginal benefit of greater
ability just offsets the marginal cost of its production. Second, the household costeffectively selects production inputs, M and C, in order to achieve the optimal level of
performance ability, A*. Finally, leisure time, L, is selected where the marginal benefit
of increased leisure just equals the marginal cost of forgone market goods and services.

6

While this model is a simplification of complex household decision-making
processes, it may be used to examine the effects of changes in the availability of publicly
financed home care. However, the effects of this increase depend on the initial
equilibrium. Three household care-giving equilibria are possible. Each depend on the
relationship between the total use of in-home care, M, and the publicly financed
maximum allocation for care recipients, m. First, in a low in-home care equilibrium,
M<m, the use of home care is less than the care recipient’s publicly financed maximum
allocation of care, m. This occurs where the subsidized unit price for publicly financed
care, (P-s), is sufficiently large relative to the household’s willingness to pay. In this
case, the care recipient’s full allocation of publicly financed care, m, is not exhausted.
Second, in a medium (or corner solution) utilization equilibrium, M=m, the household
fully exhausts the publicly financed allocation of care, m, but the unit cost of private inhome care, P, is too large for utilization, m*=0. Third, in the high utilization (or interior)
equilibrium, M>m, the household fully exhausts its publicly financed allocation, m, and
supplements this care with privately financed care, m*>0.
If we were to focus on an equilibrium in which the care recipient supplemented
publicly financed care with privately financed care, an increase in the allocation of
publicly financed care, m, is tantamount to an increase in the household’s non-wage
income. Specifically, this change increases the optimal level of performance ability, A,
through an income effect; it increases inputs of care-giving time, C, and total in-home
care, M, if these inputs are normal inputs to the production process, as relative input
prices are invariant to this increase in m; and it increases the consumption of leisure time
and market goods and services through an income effect. In this case, an increase in

7

publicly financed care, m, results in a complementary increase in care-giving activities.
In contrast, however, if the initial equilibrium were represented by a low utilization
equilibrium, M<m, in which the household did not fully exhaust its maximum allocation
of publicly financed care, m, household behavior would be invariant to a marginal change
in this maximum allocation.
Finally, if the initial equilibrium were represented by a corner solution, M=m, a
marginal change in the maximum allocation of publicly financed care yields a relative
price effect. This effect, which is associated with a reduction in the effective unit cost of
in-home care from P to (P-s), yields a substitution away from care-giving time, C,
towards more in-home care, M, and also yields an increase in care recipient performance
ability, A. Thus, in the case of a corner solution, whereby the household only exhausts
the public allocation of care, an increase in that allocation results in a decrease in
informal care-giving activities as publicly financed care substitutes for household caregiving activities. Moreover, this increased allocation of public care increases the
household’s consumption of leisure time and market goods and services.
In sum, if households supplement publicly financed home care with private care,
an increase in the public allocation yields an income effect that increases care-giving
activities. In contrast, if households fully exhaust, but do not supplement the public
allocation of care, an increase in that allocation results in a price effect that lowers caregiving activities. In both cases, care recipient performance ability is enhanced. Because
the cost (P-s) of publicly financed care is relatively low and the cost (P) of private care is
relatively large, most Canadians fully exhaust their public allocation (m) without
supplementing such care with services from the private sector, m*=0. Consequently, an

8

increase in the public allocation of home care is anticipated to decrease care-giving, C, to
increase the utilization of formal care, M, and to increase the performance ability of the
care recipient, A.

Public home care in Canada
Home care in Canada is administered at the provincial level. Provinces are not

obligated to provide in-home care under the Canada Health Act, but every province
provides some amount of public home care to its residents. All provinces offer a similar
basic range of services, including nursing services and personal support. Other services
are offered to varying degrees across the country. In this Section, some inter-provincial
differences in home care programs are sketched. A more detailed description can be
found in Health Canada (1999).
The provinces differ in the eligibility requirements for in-home services. Seven
provinces have income tests to determine co-payments for personal support services.
Two other provinces, Quebec and Manitoba, do not have a formal income cutoff, but do
prioritize service provision based on a household’s available private alternatives, be they
formal or informal care. The remaining province, Ontario, has no formal income
assessment program.
Provinces also differ in the maximum amount of publicly insured in-home care
provided to an individual. For example, Alberta has an upper limit of $3,000 per month
and Nova Scotia has an upper limit of $2,200 per month. Some provinces impose
restrictions on the maximum number of hours for in-home personal support, such as
Quebec at 40 hours per week, and Ontario at 80 hours in the first month of service and 60
hours per month thereafter.

9

The method by which individuals gain access to home care also varies across
provinces. While many provinces have moved towards a standard assessment tool, the
tools vary from province to province. Physician referrals are required in some, but not all
provinces. In some provinces nurses can request access to home care services and in
others care recipients themselves may self-refer.
One way of summarizing the varying degrees of generosity in home care
programs is by looking at differences in the share of provincial public health spending
devoted to home care. Table 1 shows this for selected years between 1992-1998. While
there has been an upward trend in the share of health spending devoted to home care, the
level and its rate of growth differ significantly across provinces. In 1998, Ontario’s share
was 5.3 percent and New Brunswick’s was 5.8 percent, while Prince Edward Island’s
share was 2.3 percent. Nova Scotia has had dramatic growth (from 1.5 percent to 5.1
percent) compared with provinces such as B.C. and PEI. While it is this variation in home
care program generosity that will be used to empirically test the model of household
decision-making, other measures are reported in Appendix A.

5.0

Data
We use two data sources for our analysis. The first data source is the public use

file from the National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The NPHS collects family and
individual information on health status and utilization as well as demographic data. The
survey was conducted in 1994/95, 1996/97, and 1998/99 and all three rounds are used in
our analysis. For a single-family member, 12 years of age and older, a more detailed
survey of health and use of health care is conducted. We use this “health file” and
examine individuals 45 years of age and older. The NPHS asks two series of questions

10

that are particularly useful for our analysis. The first inquires whether an individual
needed various forms of home care over the past twelve months. Questions pertain to the
need for help with daily activities to the need for more specialized home care. A second
set of questions concern whether individuals received home care over the past twelve
months. This in-home care is specified to be formal, and the question stipulates that the
cost should be partially or fully paid for by the government. Again, the questions range
from receiving help with meals to help from medical professionals. We use these
questions as well as the other information on health and demographics to examine
differences in the need and use of home care by provinces over time in Canada between
1994 and 1998.
The second set of data used was derived from the General Social Survey (GSS)
for 1992, 1994, and 1996. Again, this is a national survey that asks a series of questions
to a random sample of Canadians. The 1992 survey focused on the use of time, the 1994
survey on education, work and retirement, and the 1996 survey on social and community
support. While the surveys did not ask the same set of questions from year to year, in
each year the surveys asked individuals about whether or not they provided informal
home care. These surveys also collect demographic information about the respondent.
We use these surveys to examine differences in delivery of informal home care by
households by province and over time between 1992 and 1996. Means and standard
deviations for the main variables used are presented in Table 2.
Information on the generosity of public home care programs by province was
added to both of these data sets. We used the share of public health spending devoted to
in-home care by province as our measure of public home care generosity. One concern

11

with this measure is that the supply of public home care measured in this fashion is not
completely exogenous. However, two points are worth noting. First, demand for public
home care exceeds available supply of care in every province (see Table 3). Second,
provinces with high demand for home care services will have high demand for service in
many areas of the health care system, not just home care. Therefore, the relative spending
on home care versus other health care inputs should be a reasonable measure of home
care program generosity and not simply a reflection of high use. However to further
address concerns over the potential endgoenity of this measure of public generosity, we
also instrument for public home care generosity. Three exogenous variables are used as
instruments. These are correlated with the generosity of the public home care program,
but not with decisions to seek or provide care: the share of the population aged 65 and
older in each province over time; the level of provincial spending on education in each
province over time; and the provincial tax rate as a share of federal taxes in each province
over time3. As a specification check, we repeated all analyses using per capita home care
expenditures as our measure of public program generosity. Our results are not sensitive
to this alternative measure of generosity. As such, we only report the results using shares
of public health spending.

6.0

Home Care Trends Across Canada
The NPHS was used to demonstrate differences in home care needs and use

across Canada in 1994, 1996 and 1998 (see Table 3). Two features are immediately clear.
First, self-reported rates of need exceed the self-reported rates of use for all provinces

3

For Quebec, which administers its own provincial tax system, we use the top marginal rate in the province
for each year.

12

over the study period. While approximately 6 percent of the population over 45 years of
age received in-home care, the proportion reporting need for such services was about 20
percent. Second, there were wide inter-provincial variations in self-reported need and use
of home care. While there was a threefold variation in the use of home care over the
study period, variation in the need for home care fell from about 2.0 to 1.5 between 1994
and 1998.
Given the differences across provinces in both the perceived need for and use of
home care, it is important to control for provincial differences when assessing the impact
of home care program generosity on household behavior. We examine the correlates of
both the need for and use of in-home care across Canada. Our dependent variable is
whether individuals reported in-home service use in the given year and is specified as:
(4) home care

ijt

= β + β pubprog + β X + β year + β prov + ε
0
1
2 ijt
3
4
jt
t
j
ijt

where individuals are indexed by i, time by t, and provinces by j. Pubprog measures the
generosity of provincial public home care programs; X is a vector of demographic
characteristics, including age, sex, marital status, family income, education, home
ownership, and self-reported health status. This vector also includes lagged per capita
public health care spending in each province to help control for changes in the overall
level of spending on health care in a province over time. Dummy variables are also
included for year, year, and province, prov.
The results from examining the determinants of home care use are reported in
Table 4. The first column reports the marginal effects from probit estimates of the
probability of using home care. Many of the demographic variables influence the use of
home care as anticipated. Estimates suggest that men are less likely to use home care

13

than women. Married individuals are less likely to use home care than single individuals.
Both of these results are consistent with families trading off formal for informal care
when informal care is available. While individuals with higher family income are less
likely to use home care, those with more education are more likely to use home care. One
possible explanation for this result in that income is picking up the income cutoff in many
provinces, and that conditional on income, individuals with more education are likely to
be more aware of publicly available services. Older individuals and individuals who
report lower health status are more likely to use home care. Lagged per capita public
health care spending is not correlated with the probability of using home care. Home
ownership is negatively correlated with the use of home care. This might reflect
individuals’ discomfort with having potential strangers caring for them in their own
home. Previous literature examining the tradeoffs between home care and nursing homes
have found that home ownership is a strong predictor for receipt of in-home care (Cutler
and Sheiner, 1993). However, our sample does not include institutionalized individuals,
and hence, the tradeoff here is between receiving care at home or not receiving care at all.
The decision to enter a nursing home was not considered here4.
The generosity of the public program is positively and significantly correlated
with the use of home care. Again, the identifying variation in public program generosity
is within provinces over time since the regression includes both province and year
dummies. That more individuals receive care when public program generosity increases
is not particularly surprising and is consistent with the model outlined above.

4

In alternate specifications, we control for individual’s living arrangements. We find that living alone is a
significant predictor of using care, but that it has no effect on the magnitude or significance of the other
coefficients of interest.

14

The instrumental variable (IV) results, after instruments are used for the
generosity of public home care programs, are reported in the second column of Table 4.
The F-statistic on the excluded instruments (proportion of the population over 65 years,
per capita education spending, and average provincial tax rate) is 2142 and the complete
first stage results are reported in Appendix B. The IV results (run as linear probability
models and correcting for provincial clustering) are similar in sign and significance to the
probit results. The coefficient for the public generosity variable is still significant and
slightly larger than the probit marginal effect.
A potential concern with increasing the generosity of public home care programs
is that there will be a moral hazard response resulting in more individuals reporting the
need for care. One way of checking for such as response is to examine whether or not an
individual claims to need home care is a function of provincial program generosity (Table
5). Here, as above, the dependent variable takes on a value of one if an individual selfreports a need for home care. Most of the demographic variables have their expected
effect on the probability that an individual needs home care. Women are more likely to
report needing care than men. Married individuals are less likely to report need. Family
income is not a significant determinant of need. More educated and older individuals are
more likely to self-report a need for home care, and individuals who report poor health
status are also more likely to report need. In this case, the generosity of public home care
programs is not significantly correlated with self-reported needs for home care.
The IV results are reported in the second column of Table 5. The results look
much the same as the probit results, with no significant correlation between the
generosity of public home care programs and the self-reported need for home care.

15

The model outlined above predicts that more generous public programs will
increase the amount of formally provided care, M, regardless of whether individuals are
initially using both publicly and privately financed care, M>m, or only using publicly
financed care, M=m. In this case, if provinces increase the generosity of their public
programs, more individuals in need of care should receive publicly funded care. That is,
conditional on claiming to need care, the generosity of the public program should have a
positive effect on the probability of receiving care. To test this hypothesis, we condition
the sample on those individuals who claim to need care and generate a dependent variable
equal to 1 if the respondent received care. We then estimate the following equation:
(5) (receive = 1| need = 1) ijt = γ 0 + γ 1 pubprog jt + γ 2 X ijt + γ 3 yeart + γ 4 prov j + ε ijt
The results from estimating equation (5) are reported in Table 6. More generous public
programs are positively and significantly correlated with receiving care conditional on
needing care, as predicted by the model. When we instrument for the generosity of the
public home care program the coefficient is almost identical, but the standard error is
large and therefore the coefficient is no longer significantly different from zero. The
effects of some of the other covariates are also worth noting. Higher income individuals
are less likely to receive care conditional on needing it. This may reflect differences in
perceived need, although we do not find that individuals with more education have the
same result. As noted above, this may also reflect some of the income restrictions in
certain provinces. Lagged per capita health care spending in not significant. Home
ownership is negatively correlated with receiving care conditional on needing care. There
are significantly negative year effects (not reported in the Table) suggesting that the

16

probability of receiving care given that you need it decreased significantly throughout the
1990s.

7.0

Health Status and Public Home Care Programs
A further prediction from the model is that an increase in the generosity of public

home care programs will result in an increase in a care recipient’s “performance ability”.
While we are unable to fully measure performance ability using the NPHS, we can
measure the recipient’s self-reported health status. To do this we create a dichotomous
variable equal to one if the respondent claims that they are in good health or better (the
first three categories on the five category scale) and zero otherwise. We then regress selfreported health status on the set of demographic controls, outlined above, and the
generosity of public home care programs. Our results are summarized in Table 7. Our
estimates are consistent with the theoretical model, namely that self-reported health status
is positively correlated with the generosity of public home care programs. A one
percentage point increase in the fraction of public health care budgets devoted to home
care correlates with a 1.6 percentage point increase in the probability of self-reporting
good health or better. The IV estimates of the effects of the generosity of public home
care programs are larger (2.4 percentage points) and also significant and supportive of the
hypothesis derived from the simple theoretical model5.

Informal Care Givers and Public Home Care Programs
In this Section, we examine whether the generosity of public home care programs

effect household time allocations between informal care-giving, leisure and labour

The results reported here are for the entire sample. We also restrict the sample to only those individuals
reporting to be in need of care. The results are qualitatively identical for this group.

17

market activities. The General Social Survey (GSS) yields data on the incidence of
informal care-giving, however, the questions posed in each study year are not identical.
In 1992, the survey asked whether respondents provided care for someone ill in the last
month. The 1994 survey asked about providing unpaid care to seniors or others who are
not the respondent’s children, and the 1996 survey asked whether the respondent gave
any informal care to others in the past 12 months. As such, there may be shifts in the
level of care-giving across years due to the domains assessed by each question. The
regression analysis controlled for these shifts through use of year effects.
Wide inter-provincial variation in care-giving over the study period is reported in
Table 8. While 7.9 percent of Quebecers reported care-giving activities in 1992, 13.3
percent of Ontarians and 22.4 percent of Newfoundlanders reported such activities. The
provincial dummies in our regression analysis pick up the differences that are constant
over time.
The simple theoretical model suggests that a household’s care-giving response to
changes in the allocation of public home care is contingent on its resource base. If the
household fully exhausts its allocation of public home care and supplements such care
with private home care, an increase in the generosity of the public home care program
would yield an income effect that results in a complementary increase in informal caregiving activities. However, if a household did not supplement its public allocation, an
increase in the generosity of the public home care program would yield a substitution
effect that lowers informal care-giving activities.
We use the GSS surveys and a regression specification similar to the ones
outlined above to assess the determinants of care-giving activities after controlling for

18

underlying demographic characteristics and the generosity of public home care programs.
Our dependent variable is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the individual reports
providing informal care-giving and zero otherwise. To account for the hypothesized
differential effect of public programs on care-giving activities, we included an interaction
term in the regression equal to the product of the generosity of the public home care
program and a dummy variable for family income greater than or equal to $50,000.
The regression results are reported in Table 9. Consistent with the literature, the
estimates suggest women are more likely to engage in care-giving activities than men.
The relationship between care-giving activities and the respondent’s age follows an
inverted U-shaped relationship, peaking at age seventy-five. Interestingly, household
income is not correlated with providing informal care, however, individuals with more
education or working fewer hour are more likely to engage in care-giving activities.
These results are consistent with the labor and care-giving tradeoff outlined in the
theoretical model.
Theory suggests that an increase in the generosity of public home care programs
will increase care-giving activities for high-income households and decrease such caregiving activities for lower income households. This occurs because an increase in the
generosity of public home care programs yields an income effect for those who
supplement public care with private care, and a substitution effect for those who only
fully exhaust their allocation of public care. Our results are consistent with this
hypothesis. In our probit results, public program generosity is negatively and
significantly correlated with care-giving activities and the interaction effect is positive
and significant. For the IV specification, the coefficients are again negative for public

19

program generosity and positive for the interaction term, but in this case the coefficients
are no longer significantly different from zero6.
In sum, variations in the generosity of the public home care program affect caregiving activities. Our probit estimates suggest that there is an inverse relationship
between household care-giving activities and the generosity of public home care
programs, and that this relationship is smaller among higher income households. The IV
results are similar although the standard errors are larger than in the probit specification.
As noted in our theoretical analysis, because the cost of publicly financed care is
relatively low and the cost of private care is relatively large, most Canadians fully
exhaust their public allocation without supplementing such care with services from the
private sector, M=m. In this corner solution, the theory predicts that an increase in the
generosity of public home care programs lowers the relative cost of formal care, and
thereby, results in a substitution away from care-giving time, C, towards m, which is
consistent with our empirical findings.

Summary and Conclusions
We present a simple model of household decision making to better understand

how households respond to changes in publicly provided home care services. We then
test the predictions of that model using data on home care use and care-giving in Canada.
The theoretical predictions and empirical results are consistent with the
anticipated effects of the generosity of public programs on household decision-making.
Our results demonstrate that the increased availability of publicly financed home care is

Here our instruments include the three instruments outlined above as well as interactions between the
instruments and the dummy variable for family income greater than $50,000.

20

associated with an increase in its utilization and a decline in informal care-giving, with
this effect more pronounced among lower income Canadians. While self-reported health
status was positively correlated with the increased availability of publicly financed home
care, the perceived need for home care was invariant to this change.
The result that an increase in public program generosity leads to an increase in
self-reported health status has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the literature. In
itself, this result suggests that increased support for the home as a setting for the
provision of care may improve health status. This finding is robust to both our probit
estimates and our instrumental variables estimates.
The finding that an increase in the generosity of public programs was correlated
with a decline in informal care-giving is consistent with an initial equilibrium in which
care recipients’ fully exhaust their public allocation of care without supplementing such
care with services from the private sector. From a health policy perspective, however,
this response by household care-givers undermines, but does not eliminate, the potential
benefits derived by care recipients through the increased availability of formal in-home
care. This finding suggests that improvements in the generosity of public home care
programs are shared by all members of the household, both care-giver and care recipient,
and are not captured exclusively by the care recipient.
