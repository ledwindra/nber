The Steel Industry Consent Decree

ABSTRACT

This study analyzes the Consent Decree of the United States'
basic
steel industry which reformed
plant seniority systems to accomodate issues
of equal employment
opportunity. The plant—by—plant litigation
brought
under Title VII and Executive
Order 11246 is shown to be the main catalyst
which brought representatives of

the steel industry, of the United Steel

appropriate government agencies to negotiate

The principal terms of the steel industry

Consent Decree are: the establishment of a mechanism to
implement the
Decree; the uniform institution of
plant—wide seniority; the retention of
pay rates after transfer to a position
that provides a lower pay rate than
the previous position; the establishment of goals for
minority representation in trade and craft jobs; and a back pay settlement.
The analysis of
these provisions reveals two
related points. Black representation in trade
and craft jobs increased in
the four year period after the Decree, with an
indication that the increase was greater than pre—1974

Office of Federal Contract Compliance

(OFCC), and the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the employment practices of a key segment of
the United States manufacturing sector

were affected. The nature of' the

basic steel industry, the nature of the actors involved, the historical
relationship of these principal actors, the economic climate and general
timing of the negotiations are factors specific to the case of the Steel
Consent Decree that helped to determine the unique process and outcome
embodied in the Decree.

Consent decrees had been emerging since the time of the American
Telephone and Telegraph Consent Decree as a method for parties to form the
substance and implementation mechanisms of the equal employment opportunity

policies with which they would live. Many

consent decrees, particularly

those involving white—collar jobs, were negotiated in settings without

unions. In cases in which employee organizations

were present, their

role tended to be limited. In the steel case, not only was the United
Steelworkers of America (USWA) a principal actor, but it instigated the

process. The USWA was also a union operating in a

multiemployer setting.

The relationship between the USWA and the array of employers had reached
a stage of maturity in which collective bargaining
for the first time by the Experimental

was being governed

Negotiating Agreement (ENA). The

negotiations of the Decree coincided with the initial ENA collective bar-

gaining negotiations. Furthermore, through the early l970s, the steel
industry was a contracting industry hard pressed by increased

—2—

competition from imports, by a general economic recession, and by the com--

pounding problems of extensive new capital investment to modernize the

domestic steel production process. All such environmental factors which
helped to determine the process, as well as the outcome, of the Decree
deserve attention in an analysis of the steel industry's consent decree.
Moreover, employment policies in this key manufacturing sector impact on
other sectors, so that an analysis of the Decree should be mindful of such
spillovers.

Specifically, this paper is divided into four sections. Section I
describes the setting in which the actors caine to negotiate the Decree.

This section will consider the following categories of environmental factors: the demographics of employment, the economic environment of the industry, the environment described by pre—existing litigation, and other poli-

tical and positioning considerations of the parties. Section II describes
the principal terms and features of the Consent Decree. For the substantive
features of the Decree, there is an analysis of the impact of each feature

on employment outcomes in the steel industry in Section III. In the final
section, broader impacts of the Steel Consent Decree are indicated ——

I. The Setting for Negotiations

p1oyment Trends in Basic Steel
One factor shaping the perceptions of
employer and employee representatives in the period leading up to the formulation of the Consent
Decree was the size and distribution of the minority

workforce within the

steel industry's total workforce. The larger the percentage of minorities,
and the more unequal the distribution of

minorities between positiOns

affording different economic opportunities, the

greater the effort one

would expect from the minorities within the USWA to move the union to address the issues of equal employment

opportunity. In this section, such

employment trends in the steel industry are

considered for the decade

preceeding the Consent Decree.

Table 1 presents employment changes in the steel industry workforce
form 1966—74.

In 1966, one observes the basic pattern of employment that

the Consent Decree would ultimately be

designed to change. Out of a work—

force of 798,556 employees, 14.26% or 113,860 were black.

This black

workforce was heavily concentrated in blue—collar occupations, and within
the blue—collar occupations, black employees show a higher representation

in lower skilled jobs. Of all craftsmen in 1966, 6.31% were black, as compared to 20.28% of all operatives and 28.19% of all unskilled laborers.

However, the trends over the next eight years, presented in Table 1,
do not show movement toward greater

inequality in this employment distri-

bution. Industry employment fluctuated over this eight year period with an
overall downward trend. Within this relatively unstable employment framework, black representat ion in all major

occupational categories is very

stable. Black employment in the industry increases slightly from 14.26%
in 1966 to 14.82% in 1974, while total employment fell from 798,556 to

there is little fluctuation. Throughout

this time, blacks are relatively

underrepresented in white—collar jobs and in trade and craft jobs within

The Economic Environment of the Steel Industry
Even with gains in industry employment in 1973 and 1974, employment

in basic steel decreases by nearly 100,000

employees from 1966 to the year

of the Consent Decree. This general employment decline is consistent with
the decline in the competitive position of

industry. Such a position would reinforce the companies' interest in a—

Figures presented in Table 2 describe business trends in the steel

industry in the period prior to the Consent Decree. From 1960 to 1970,
1/

profits as a percent of sales declined steadily from 5.8% to 2.6%, with
increases in profitability in 1973 and 1974. Comparatively modern
steel production processes abroad also hurt the competitve position of the

United States steel industry in the world market. Steel imports increased
steadily over the decade, accounting for 4.7% of domestic consumption in
2/

1960. In 1968, the percentage had increased to 16.7%.
Furthermore, the problems confronting the steel industry during the
business contraction of the early 1970s were compounded by extensive capital
investment projects to replace obsolete and energy inefficient production

equipment. In 1970, $1.73 billion of new capital investment was undertaken

in the basic steel industry.
Imports of steel and industry employment and profitability point con-

sistently to contraction in the basic steel industry through the 1960s and

early 1970s. However, statistics for 1973 and 1974 just as consistently indicate expansion of the industry. The protracted period of contraction may
well have been a factor that heightened industry's interest to avoid costly
litigious proceedings concerning employment opportunity in the industry, yet
the 1973—74 upturn in the industry may have presented negotiators of the

Decree with brighter prospects for the industry. One representative of
the USWA familiar with the negotiation of the Steel Consent Decree felt that
the long—term declining position of the industry was not an important or
5/

explicit consideration in the negotiation of the Decree.

The improving

position of the industry in 1973 and 1974 may have partly been responsible
for this perspective, yet a mechanism that would effectively address the
issues of minority employment opportunity required a design which

recognized long—term industry contraction and the accompanying employment
contraction which basic steel was to face through the remainder of the

1970s. The Decree's design and its effectiveness in light of this industry situation are discussed in the following sections.

A Background of Litigation
The environment as described by the employment and industry trends
set the framework within which the USWA, the steel companies and the govern-

ment would operate. More specifically, it was the litigation brought under
I

Title

VII and Executive Order 11246 which provided the catalyst that brought

the parties to negotiate over the industry's basic seniority/employment

opportunity practices. The steel industry had been confronted with issues
concerning the possible discriminatory effects of seniority systems in place

at various plants in several cases over a long history. The decisions on
this issue are divided into two distinct groups by the Second Court of Appeals
decision in United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant)

in June 1971. The set of decisions prior to this appeals court decision did not provide for any seniority "carryover" or "rate retention" and

generally did not threaten any plant's seniority system. These decisions

include itfie1d v. United Steelworkers of America, Local 2708 (l958);6/
Federal District Court decisions in United States v. H.K. Porter (l968)'
and the United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant)
(1970);8I and In the Matter of Bethlehem Steel CorDoration (Sparrows Point

Plant) OFCC Docket #102—68 (1970), The second set of cases reversed
the trend set by the early decisions, and threatened seniority systems

in place by providing for remedies of rate retention and seniority

carryover generally for the affected class of minority employees. These

—9—

cases include the Court of Appeals decision in United States v, Bethlehem

Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant) (1971),lO/ In the Matter of Bethlehem

Steel Corporation (Sparrows Point Plant) (l973),l and the District Court
decision in United States V.

United States Steel Corporation (Fairfield

Plant) (1973).12/

The first case to address the possible inequalities inherent in a
steel seniority system was Whitfield v. United Steel Workers of America,

Local 2708 (1958). Before the Fifth Circuit prior to Title VII in 1958,
the court left the seniority system at the Arnico Steel Corporation's plant
in Houston, Texas unaltered, stating that when ".. .a large company substi-

tutes a program of equal job opportunity for previous discriminatory
practices.. .it is impossible to place Negro incumbents holding certain jobs,

especially unskilled jobs, on absolutely equal footing with white incumbents

in skilled jobs." The court

.

.attach{edj

particular importance to the

good faith effort of the parties in working toward a fair solution. .

.The

Union and the Company. . .have a contract that from now on is free from any

discrimination based on race. Angels could do no more.

As this

language indicates, the Whitfield opinion focusses on how fairly the com-

pany and union represent the interests of minority employees. Court
opinions for cases heard after the enactment of Title VII would
require language that would encompass both the duty of fair representation
and the provisions of the equal opportunity legislation.
Following Whitfield is the array of cases brought under Title VII

and Executive Order 11246. The case responsible for the first decision
under this legislation on these seniority—based issues was United States
v. H.K. Porter Company (1968) heard in the northern district of Alabama.
Despite the fact that the departmental seniority system in Porter helped

— 10—

to maintain inequalities in the racial compositions of departments, the
trial court rejected the government's arguments for a remedy of the

institution of a plant—wide seniority system. Rather, the court found that
skills, training, and hazards differed significantly from job—to—job, and
it would therefore be inappropriate to assume:
that the employees in this steel mill are in no danger
of injury from the performance of the jobs around them
by14,
employees with less than the full amount of experience...

As the appeals process began in Porter, United States v. Bethlehem
Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant) (1970) was brought under Title VII in
the western district of New York and a hearing panel was established In The
Matter of Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Sparrows Point Plant) (1970) under

Executive Order 11246. Both cases involved larger steel plants than in
the Porter case (1968), and thereby were more typical of steel mill opera-

tions. In the Lackawanna (1970) case, the government again sought a
revamping of a department—wide seniority system which helped maintain a
system in which 83% of all black employees were concentrated in eleven of
the company's eighty—two departmentsl5/ by allowing blacks employed in
these eleven departments to transfer with rate retention and without loss
of seniority privileges.
The trial court rejected the government's argument here as well.
Among the reasons for the court upholding the department—wide system were:
(1) that the eleven departments in question were by no means
exclusively black departments, with two—thirds of the employees white;
(2) that the earnings of blacks in these departments were 96.7%
of the average hourly earnings of all plant employees, despite greater
seniority of white employees throughout the plant;
(3) that these eleven departments provided more stable employment

—11—

subject to fewer cyclical layoffs;
(4) that the level of transfers was significant under the existing

seniority system without rate retention and carryover;
(5) that the company had in place a system to cure the racial
imbalance in representation in departments;
(6) and that the government's remedy was fraught with potential dis—

ruptive effects on incentive pay programs, the job classification scheme,
and expectations for promotion of employees outside the "affected' class.161
The affirmation of the department—based

seniority system was miti-

gated by the trial court's granting of preferential transfer

rights to

employees (white as well as black) in the eleven departments based on plant
seniority, but without rate retention or seniority carryover•

Following on the Lackawanna (1970) decision, a hearing panel for the
Office of Federal Contract Compliance's case, In the Matter of Bethlehem
Steel Corporation (Sparrows Point Plant) (1970) followed the trend of the
previous cases, rejecting the need for any remedies, much less remedies with

rate retention or carryover. The decision of the hearing panel stressed, in
much the same fashion as did the trial court in Porter

(1968), the business

necessity for the existing system in the steel industry setting.

The decisions consistently left in place the department—wide senior-

ity systems in each case. As the appeal process continued for this set of
cases, the consistent trend of the trial courts and the OFCC case hearing

panel would be reversed. In June of 1971, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed both the trial court in Lackawanna (1970) and the trend of
decisions on such seniority issues. The fact -that the departmental segregation did not impact greatly on earnings did not convince the Second Circuit
that the affected class of minorities should therefore not be given special

—12—

consideration in future transfers. As for the effect on promotion expectations of those in the non—affected class, the appeals court posited that
those "hopes arise from an illegal system," and further that "if relief
under Title VII can be denied merely because the majority group of employees,
who have not suffered discrimination, will be unhappy about it, there is

little hope of correcting the wrongs to which the Act is directed.l7/
The Appeals Court felt the trial court "put it backwards" in denying relief

because the existing system did not deter all transfers. The criterion of
the Appeals Court was "what would be necessary to insure sufficient incentive to transfer so that the effects of past discrimination could not be
perpetuated.

,,181

In connection with this line of argument, the Second Circuit granted
seniority carryover and rate retention for members of the affected class and
removed the special transfer privileges of white employees in the eleven

departments. The "black only" or affected class only approach was to be
a strong catalyst in moving the USWA to adopt the Consent Decree approach
of addressing these issues.
In Januray of 1973, after review of the hearing panel's recoinmen—

dations, the Secretary of Labor, James Hodgson, ignored the panel's recom-

mendations in his decision on Sparrows Point, OFCC Docket #102—68. Secretary Hodgson "framed a remedy which is consistent with the evidence and the
relevant court decisions, particularly relying on the Second Circuit Court
19 /

of

Appeals in United States v. Bethlehem."
As the trend in decisions was being reversed, a case involving the

seniority system of the large Fairfield plant of the United States Steel

Corporation was pending in the northern district of Alabama. Wishing to
settle Fairfield out of court, the USWA and the government representatives

—13—

urged the Fifth Circuit to deliver a decision on the appeal of Porter (1968),

still awaiting a hearing. A Fairfield settlement could then be reached
based on the guidelines that the Fifth Circuit would prescribe in Porter.20/
No decision was forthcoming, and so the Fairfield case was heard in the
northern district of Alabama over several months in 1973, "with more than

10,000 pages of testimony, and over ten feet of stipulations and exhibit."2
Judge Pointer's decision would form the basis of the substance eventually
embodied in the Steel Consent Decree.

Pointer's decision partially adopted the government's request for

a remedy involving rate retention and carryover. But seeking an "evenhanded" approach, the provision that plant seniority would govern promotions, layoffs, and other areas would apply to all employees in the plant.

Rate retention applied to those minorities that were included within the

definition of affected Fairfield employees. Pointer's decision was the
last deicison to have a significant impact on the seniority discrimination

issue. The decision in the Porter (1968) appeal would be based upon a
stipulation of the parties in 1974.

Other Positioning Considerations
With the trend in key cases modifying seniority systems with "black—
only" remedies, and with the Fairfield decision presenting a middle—ground
remedy, potential benefits of negotiation of the Consent Decree now existed.
In review of the development of this environment conducive to negotiation,

three specific factors moved the USWA to promote negotiation. The trend
in decisions toward remedies providing for black only modifications to
seniority systems, the USWA felt, would create undesirable fragmentation

within their membership, and other disruptions at the plant level. Second,

—14—

the USWA had advocated plant—wide seniority for some time, but left the
determination of the system to the discretion of locally autonomous bar-

gaining. Finally, the cases that were being decided were but a fraction
of all cases involving seniority and equal employment opportunity in basic

steel. According to one company representative, the ability of the companies, the USWA, and the government representatives to avoid the
escalating costs associated with a plant—by—plant approach to seniority
remedies was the principal factor which motivated these parties to adopt

an industry—wide solution.22/
Beyond these specific reasons that made the time right for the
Consent Decree, the declining condition of the industry was a broader
environmental factor that made it more desirable to avoid court cases and

settlements that would be costly to the industry. This was particularly
important, since, even after Fairfield, industry representatives felt
they could win appeals of the decisions and win decisions in upcoming cases
23/

on grounds of "business necessity," as in the H.K. Porter case of 1968.

Industry conditions would not allow the company representatives the luxury of overlooking less costly approaches to the issue.

Also pointed out,

the general employment picture did not indicate any easing of the problems
as blacks, from 1963 to 1974, were still by and large segregated out of
trade and craft occupations.

One final consideration in the development of the environment
necessary to allow negotiation of the Consent Decree was the well—developed

bargaining relationship of the USWA and industry representatives. In 1974,
the basic collective bargaining agreement was expiring and to be replaced
by a successor agreement negotiated for the first time under the Experi-

mental Negotiating Agreement (ENA). Parties had planned on taking advan—

—15—

tage of the opportunity of memorializing the negotiated settlement of the
seniority/employment opportunity issues in the collective bargaining agree-

ment. Once it was decided to include the result of these

negotiations in

the collective bargaining agreement, timing of ENA negotiations put pressure on the parties to reach agreement by the expiration date of the

previous collective bargaining agreement. If issues on the Consent Decre
were left unresolved, the parties were fearful that such issues would be
24/

subject to the decision of a third party arbitrator,

since under the

ENA any issue of successor collective bargaining agreement unresolved by
the bargaining deadline was to be decided by an arbitrator.

Furthermore,

the USWA Executive Board felt the seniority issues could even threaten
the ENA procedure itself:

It would be unwise to subject that negotiating procedure
[ENA] to the stress of reforming seniority. The success
of the new procedure will depend heavily upon the effectiveness with which it meets our [USWA's] members needs
in 1974. If the seniority issue were to be handled under
the new procedure, the resulting tensions could seriously
threaten the ENA. 25/
The economic and employment settings in the basic steel industry
came together with the trend of legal decisions on seniority systems' discriminatory impact in such a way that it was of mutual interest to the USWA,
the steel companies, and government representatives to negotiate an industry—

wide solution to the problem. Pressure to address the issue was also brought
to bear on the negotiations by the bargaining deadline of the industry's collective bargaining agreement.

II. The Provisions of the Consent Decree —— Consent Decree I
Once parties decided to address the seniority system and discrimination issues in negotiation, the remedies focused on a concept that had

—16—

been inherent in debates on civil rights issues since the late l950s,

the concept of "rightful place." Under this doctrine, the remedy devised
would have to concern itself with the fact that seniority systems in plants
throughout the industry had denied blacks and other minorities their rightful place in terms of occupation, earnings and future job opportunities.

This doctrine can be applied in two ways. Retrospectively, how would a
remedy address the fact that minorities had been denied their rightful place
over past years and thereby been on lower earning paths for a significant

part of their careers? Prospectively, how would the Consent Decree alter
the seniority provisions in plants across the country to permit minorities

to reach their rightful occupational and earnings levels. This section
describes the remedies prescribed for the steel industry in Consent Decree
I; that is, the part of the Consent Decree package that considered the
situation of the production and maintenance workforce in basic steel (Consent
Decree II will not be directly addressed in this discussion, as the negotia-

tion of Decree II did not involve the USWA. Decree II altered employment

practices in white—collar positions and in hiring practices. Generally,
Decreee II, formulated after Decree I had been settled, followed the outline
of Decree I in form and substance.)

More specifically, the basic features

of Consent Decree I were: the establishment of a mechanism to implement the
Decree; the uniform institution of plant—wide seniority; the particular
application of plant continuous service for transfer opportunities; the
retention of pay rates, or "red circling't when transferring if the new

positions's rate of pay was lower than the rate at the former position;
the establishment of trade and craft goals for minority representation;

and a back pay settlement. For the provisions which altered employment
practices and relationships among employees, the impact of the provision

—17-

in the first four years of the Decree, from 1974—78, will be analyzed in
Section III.

The Implementation Mechanism
Because of the familiarity with the steel industry achieved by
Judge Pointer from the lengthy Fairfield hearing, the government asked

Pointer to be the judge to enter the Consent Decree. The first of three
levels of the mechanism for implementing the Decree was thereby estab-

lished. The District Court of Northern Alabama would maintain

jurisdic-

tion over the Decree, its substance as well as implementation, for a
period of at least five years from the date of the Decree.

At a second level, and coordinating the implementation activity at
all plants covered by the Decree, is the Audit and Review Committee. The
A&R Committee was a continuation of the Seniority Study Committee of the
Coordinating Committee of Steel Companies and the United Steelworkers of

America. To this Seniority Study Committee the government added a representative to form the A&R Committee. The Decree sets out four broad
responsibilities for the A&R Committee:
(1) oversee the implementation of and compliance with the Consent
Decree at the plant level;
(2) take up the resolution matters that remain in dispute at the
plant level;

(3) begin a review of the experience under the Decree no later
than December 31, 1975 with regard to transfer opportunities and records,
achievement of trade and craft goals, and related matters;
(4) bring to the District Court any issue which it is unable to
26/

resolve or clarify on its owii.

—18—

The lowest tier of the mechanism is occupied by

Imple—

mentation Committees. The role of these committees a defined in the
Decree is to:

(1) take the functional steps necessary to assure compliance with
trade and craft goals, timetables, and implementation ratios;
(2) provide information to plant employees;

(3) consider grievances which are Decree related' (other grievances are to be handled by the pre—existing grievance machinery);
(4) be available to employees at convenient hours.27/

This self—enforcing monitoring mechanism benefits from the knowledge and
experience of the TJSWA and the companies with these issues. Furthermore,
the provision for evaluation built a legitimizing influence into the
process.

The Institution of Plant—Wide Seniority
At the heart of the Decree is Section 4(a) which provides in part:
plant continuous service. . . shall be used.., for all
purposes in which a measure of continuous service
is presently being utilized [under the contract.] 28/

Plant service date would be the ruling criterion in selection of employees

for promotion, transfer, layoff and recall. Furthermore, in contracts
which provide for use of seniority in such matters as vacation selection,
overtime allocation, and shift scheduling, plant continuous service governs

the selection. This section specifically forbids "leap—frogging or a
reshuffling of the relative positions of employees at the time of the Decree;
rather it is a prospective remedy applying to future job vacancies or

closings. As the Consent Decree is further described, the experience under
the first four years of the Decree will be analyzed in considering the effec—

—19—

tiveness of this prospective remedy, particularly in the area of transfers
and the achievement of equality in minority representation in trade and
craft positions.

Trans fers

An important distinction to be made on the transfer according tr

plant

service aspects of the remedy is that the Consent Decree does not

alter lines of progression within departmental units. In this way, a
permanent vacancy within a department will be filled from below within a

department. Once employees fill the chain of vacancies within a department, an entry level vacancy occurs. This resultant opening is then
filled on the basis of plant Continuous service. To promote transfer
within these limitations, the Decree provides for criteria governing distribution of the information Concerning job openings, for the availability

of training opportunities, and for a forty—five day trial period during
which an employee who transfers may return to his old position.

Rate Retention

The notion of rate retention is a feature of the Decree intended

to promote transfers. Any employee whose plant service date predates
January 1, 1968, whether the employee is a member of the "affected class"
or not, will receive upon transfer the rate of the new job or the rate of

his previous position (based on an average of pay rates from the last several pay periods prior to transfer) whichever is greater. The rate retention feature applies for a two year period, with each
allowed two transfers with rate retention.

Trade and Craft Goals
The Audit and Review Committee is instructed to carry Out an analysis
of the utilization of blacks and other minorities in trade and craft occu-

pations in plants covered by the Consent Decree. This analysis is to identify whether minorities are underutilized in various groups of trade and craft

occupations. Where it is identified that "underutilization" exists, goals
and timetables are to be formulated to move employment toward the standards

developed in the Decree. A fifty percent implementation rate is established
by the Decree, so that where underutilization exists, one—half of entry

level vacancies which occur are to be made available to minorities. Underutilization is generally decided on the goal of having minority representation in trade and craft positions equal to the minority representations in
the plant as a whole.

Back Pay

The above provisions of Consent Decree I are primarily forward
looking, addressing the prospective "rightful place" notion; that is, how
were minorities to be given the, opportunity to attain a representative po-

sition within the economic system of the basic steel industry. However,
inherent in the forward looking remedies is the understanding that minorities had been denied their rightful place in that system for past years
due to a seniority system which locked employees into relative positions

determined partially by past discrimination. The back pay provision of
Consent Decree I specifically recognizes the past discrimination and the

loss of economic opportunity due to that discrimination. Negotiations led
to the establishement of a $35 million fund from which "affected class em-

ployees" would be able to claim back pay. However, toward the end of the

—21—

process, the Inland Steel Company withdrew from the
settlement to reduce the total number of

nine. Since Inland is basically a single
benefited as much as other companies from

negotiations and final

companies involved from ten to
plant company it may not have
a solution designed to avoid

plant—by—plant remedies. The $35 million fund was reduced in proportion
to estimates of Inland's share of Taffected class"

employees to a new total

of $30,940,000. The minimum payment a claiming employee could receive
would be $250, with the actual amount determined

by a formula based on

minority/non_minority earning differentials and factors related to length

of service. An important feature of the back pay provision is that for an
employee to claim back pay it was "required [that he] sign a release
relieving the USWA and the company from all claims

arising out of pre—

Decree acts,' including existing Title VII or Executive Order 11246

cases. 29

/

III. Living with the Consent Decree —— An
Analysis of Impact
All of the provisions of Consent Decree I come together with the
stagnant economic environment of the steel industry of the mid—1970s to
create a particular set of incentives and
and maintenance (P&M) employees in the

opportunities for production

industry. This specific set of in-

centives and opportunities determine how

quickly the industry would realize

the employment goals of the Decree, if at all. In this section, the
ence of the industry in changing employment

experi-

patterns, specific resolutions of

back pay issues, and other issues related to Consent Decree I
are anlyzed.

Minority Representation in Trade and Craft Occupations
At the center of the Decree as well

as the prior litigation was the

—2 2—

underrepresentation of minorities in trade and craft positions in the indus-

try. Here, the changing patterns of representation of the black workforce

in trade and craft positions is analyzed. The method for the analysis is
based on the Chi—square test. For 103 plants in 1974 and 124 plants in 1978,
data on the number of blacks and non—blacks in trade and craft positions and
non—trade and craft positions are compared to the expected number of blacks

and non—blacks in those positions. The expected number is calculated based on
the Decree's goal that minorities should be represented in trade and craft
positions in the same proportion as their representation in the plant as a

whole. In addition to the Chi—square analysis, the deviation of the expected number of blacks in trade and craft positions from the actual number is

calculated.

30 /

This deviation is standardized according to the binomial

standard deviation formula,

NP(l—P), where:

N =

total

P

percentage of all black and white
production and maintenance employees that are black.

number of black and white
trade and craft employees,

Before results of the analysis are presented, certain factors inher-

ent in the employment situation should be noted. Since expected representation figures are based on current percentages of minorities within plants,
it will become more (less) difficult for a given plant to realize the goal of
equal representation in trade and craft positions should minorities gain

(lose) in plant—wide representation from 1974 to 1978. Table 3 illustrates

this point. Although industry totals show a very stable minority representation in the P&M workforce with an increase of 0.41 percentage points in
minority representation, plants of certain companies show more marked changes.
Specifically, certain plants of the Armco Steel Corporation are expected to

have a more difficult task in equalizing representation in trade and craft

jobs as minority representation at Armco plants increased 5.85%. The
opposite is expected to hold for the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation
and the National Steel Corporation.
Summary statistics indicate the general situation in regards to black

representation in the steel industry. In 1974, in 106 plants blacks held
3824 of the 42,221 trade and craft positions. Based on the proportion of
blacks in the total P&M workforce, blacks would have been expected to hold

10,163 of these craft jobs. This deviation is represented by a Chi—square
statistic of 6223.1, significant at well above the .001 level, while the
expected black representation in craft jobs is 68.75 standard deviations off

the acutal. (The size of this industry—wide deviation should be thought of
as a curnmulative account, not an average of underutilization in individual
plants.)

The 1978 figures show movement toward equalizing the distributions of

black employees across the P&N workforce; however, the inequality is still

very evident. Blacks held 4949 of the 40,348 craft positions, whereas they
were expected to hold 10,215 of these positions. This fact is sunutarized by
a Chi—square statistic of 4358.9, while the actual number of blacks in trade
and craft jobs is a slightly lower but still significant 57.08 standard deviations from the expected.
Aside from asking whether Consent Decree I realized the goal of
equalizing the racial composition across blue—collar occupations, a different
question in gauging the industry impact of Consent Decree I is: to what degree is the employment distribution in trade and craft positions different

from what it would have been in the absence of the Decree? Ideally, one would
apply characteristics of individual employees at each plant to seniority rules
as they were prior to the Decree, and compare that outcome to the actual out—

1.645 indicates a deviation of expected from actual representation that

is

significant at the .05 level. For 1974, the mean of the deviations is 5.07,
the median is 3.12. Approximately 82% of the plants have significant deviations from expected representations.

For 1978, after four years under Consent Decree I, one sees from
inspection a shift in the distribution of standard deviations to the left,'

consistent with the industry—wide trend. The mean and median of the 1978
distribution are 3.75 and 2.12 respectively, both still

significanly posi-

tive. Approximately 56% of all plants in 1978 continue to show significant
underutilization of blacks in trade and craft positions.

Blacks have gained

in their representation in trade and craft positions. However, one cannot
say that blacks have attained their "rightful place" after four

years.

Figures 3a—e and 4a—e are histograms showing the geographic break-

down of these overall distributions according to a geographic classification

of

plants described by Richard L. Rowan in The Negro in the Steel Industry.

34 /

In both years, the Great Lakes Midwestern region accounts for a substantial

proportion of the underutilization of blacks in craft jobs. The mean of the
Midwest distribution is 2.8 units and 2.0 units greater than the mean of
the industry—wide distribution in 1974 and 1978

respectively. However,

the mean of the Midwest distribution also shows the

greatest percentage

decrease over the four year period.

Further investigating the nature of underutilization of blacks
in trade and craft positions, the analysis turns to the investigation of
underutilization of blacks in the six broad classifications of trade and
craft positions defined by the industry's Audit and Review Committee. These
craft categories are electrical, metalworks,

machinist, moulder, bricklayer,

and millwright. Table 4 shows the changes in employment by race for each of

All categories in both years show significant underutilization

of blacks

in the industry. The

bricklayer grouping shows a movement away from the
expected black representation
over these four years, while
electricians
and millwrights show the
largest discrepancy between eected and actual
representation for blacks.

with the terms of Consent Decree I, while the implementation ratio of 5O/

continued in effect. bat was the specific experience with regards to transfers in the industry in the early years of the Decree, and how did employees

react to the incentives contained in the Decree? Thereas, the previous
analysis shows how transfer activity into trade and craft jobs has operated
over the first four years of the Decree, this section will concern itself
with transfer activity between non—trade and craft jobs.
In a report filed with the United States District Court in the

Northern District of Alabama, the Audit and Review Committee examines the

experience under the first two years of the Decree. Table 5 summarizes
this transfer activity.

Among males, transfer activity is relatively equal for all races

while white males make somewhat greater use of the voluntary return ex-

perience. Females, particularly black females, make relatively greater use
of the transfer experience; however, females still make up only 3.2 of the
P&M workforce.

In this same report, the Audit and Review Committee makes another

point: although the transfer prvisions were designed to allow employees
to select more desirable positions, the experience of the first two years
demonstrates that younger employees benefited most from the system. Transfer
systems, depending on the size and logistics of plants, are either two or

three stage processes. No matter what the system design, or the race or
sex of the employees, younger employees (those with less than five years of
service) accounted for over half of all transfers as shown in Table 6.

Voluntary returners also were accounted for primarily by younger employees.
Among the reasons employees gave for using the 45—day return option, the

most common was that the new position did not meet expectations in terma of

Other reasons include using the option to call attention

to other grievances, to improve short—term earnings due to brief periods of
overtime opportunities in specific departments or to obtain better seasonal

working conditions. Based on these latter reasons, the Audit and Review
Committee altered the Decree, with the courts' approval, to prohibit an
employee from transferring for a six month period after using the 45-day re—
36/

turn option.

Benefits

Conferred

Under Rate Retention

1ale employees with service predating 1968 and female employees in
the workforce on the effective date of Consent Decree I were eligible for

the rate retention option. The Audit and Review Committee's analysis of
the experience under this provision shows that 2555 employees made use of

rate retention through March 31, 1977. The Committee estimated that 13% of
all transferring employees benefited from the rate retention provision.
The breakdown of employees using this provision by race and sex is shown
in Table 7.

Back Pay Tenders

The Consent Decree provides for a $250 minimum payment to any
employee in the affected class and general guidelines for the calculation

of actual payments. Table 8 summarizes the results by the Audit and Review
Committee. The $30,940,000 fund was so allocated to "affected class" employees, that an average payment of $660 was made. The unions' contribu—
tion to the $30,940,000 fund was $4,420,089.

Finail:, the Audit and Review Committee compiled statistics showinp

the

acceptance rates of back pay tenders by company through December 1976.

Bethlehem Steel's experience shows the lowest acceptance rate of just under

90%, as opposed to approximately 97% for other companies. This rate was
attributable to that company's Lackawanna and Sparrow's Point plants, at
both of which private Title VII cases were pending, and at both of which
concerted efforts were made by the proponents of those suits to deter
37!

acceptance of tenders.
Table 9.

The complete set of acceptance rates is shown in

Indeed, a representative for the union familiar with the Consent

Decree's negotiation, expressed the view that those who were most vocal in
expressing disapproval with the terms of Consent Decree I were representatives of organizations that would be deprived of fees from the "undermining
38/

of pending lawsuits."

In connection with the back pay and rate retention provisions of
the Consent Decree, an understanding of the nature of the earnings differ-

entials between occupations is necessary. No specific information on the
steel industry wage bill by occupation is available. Furthermore, job
classes and working pay scales in the basic labor agreement do not

apply consistently to given occupations in plants across the country.

However, certain facts about pay rates are revealing. Trade and craft jobs
often al1 in classes 14 to 18 of the basic agreement which sets out a

total

of 34 classes.

Not rarely, operative positions, in which black

representation exceeded 20% through the l970s, are classified above these

mid—range positions. Furthermore, many non—trade and craft jobs offer in—

centive

40 /

pay opportunities greater than those in trade and craft jobs.

IV.

Impacts Outside of the Steel Indu
Outside of the

impact

of the Steel Industry Consent Decree analyzed

here, the negotiation of this industry's equal employment opportunity policy
had an impact reaching well beyond the scope of the steel industry. As
mentioned previously, the terms of the Steel Consent Decree were included
as part of the terms of the industry's collective bargaining agreement.
Historically, the negotiations for the steel industry are visible and pat-

tern—setting. Most pronounced among such bargaining spillovers is the
relationship of basic steel with the aluminum industry. Jhat makes this
relationship particularly strong is the fact that the USWA is the principal
employee representative in both industries.

As a result of this historical pattern the terms of the basic steel
Consent Decree were incorporated practically verbatim within the framework of

the aluminum industry's collective bargaining agreement. The legal setting
of the aluminum industry's equal employment policy did not directly involve

government or court participation. The policy was the product of collective

bargaining. This fact was eventaully to have a significant impact on future
processes of the determination of equal employment policies. Specifically,
with the array of litigation associated wit United States v. Brian Weber
taking place in the setting of the aluminum industry, an opinion with a
great impact on the scope of collective bargaining was put forth by the

—5 (j..

Supreme Court. In this way, the Steel Industry Consent Decree was to have
an impact on industrial relations even beyond the implications for the
specific field of equal employment opportunity.

V. Conclusion
The process of negotiation that produced the Consent Decree must in
the end be evaluated against the alternative that had been available to

minority employees —

litigation

conducted on a plant—by—plant basis. The

major steel companies and the USWA were able in the negotiation process to
bring their expertise to the issue of seniority reform more directly than
might have been possible under a process carried out in court; moreover,
once responsible for the outcome, these key actors in this employment
setting, together with the participating government representatives,

were in a position of defending that outcome. Although litigation might
have allowed for greater direct particination of minorities, the Consent
Decree negotiation helped to limit the costs involved in reaching a settle-

ment. Furthermore, under the Decree, a mechanism for self—enforcement and
evaluation of progress that would not have been possible under the litigation of individual cases was instituted.
While the employment outcomes for the steel industry that might have
resulted from case—by—case litigation cannot be known, the experience of
the industry in the first four years of the Consent Decree I does reveal

two related points. Black representation in trade and craft jobs increased
over the period, particularly from 1974 to 1975, with an indication that
the increase was greater than pre—1974 employment trends would have

predicted. However, the 1978 black/white employment figures show that
extreme underutilization of blacks in these positions still exists. The

-5-

lack of more rapid movement toward equality in the occupational distribution could be due to earnings differentials that do not always favor trade

and craft jobs or to a mechanism for changing the distribution that is
ineffective in the post—1974, contracting steel industry (after the brief

1973—74 upturn). To gauge the degree to which these or other factors are
responsible requires the analysis of more detailed data.
