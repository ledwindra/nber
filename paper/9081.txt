ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the question of whether societies that afford economic opportunity to
women offer other opportunities as well. The analysis in this paper shows that the performance of a
country’s women in international athletic competition reflects the degree of their relative participation in
that country’s labor market. There is a significant positive relationship across countries between a high
ratio of the labor force participation rate of women to the labor force participation rate of men and the
number and type of medals won by a country’s women in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. Teams
representing countries with high relative labor force participation rates also were both more likely to
qualify for the 1999 Women’s Soccer World Cup and to do well in that competition. This effect of
relative labor force participation rates on athletic success is found while controlling for a nation’s income
per capita, population, men’s performance in related sporting events, rate of participation of women in
government, and fertility rate. These results suggest that the participation of women in a country’s labor
force is an important reflection of their opportunities in other areas as well.

I. Introduction
What can a country’s performances in international sporting events, like the
Olympics or the World Cup, teach us about its society? World-class level competitors
are more likely to come from more populous countries, all else equal, since these nations
represent larger pools of potential talent. The percentage of a country’s population that
has the opportunity to develop their athletic talent is larger in richer countries where
people are healthier, the young are less likely to be engaged in work, and more resources
are devoted to leisure activities, including sports. A number of studies have shown that,
in fact, population and per capita income are significant determinants of Olympic
success.1
The analysis in this paper demonstrates that another key characteristic of a
country, one not studied in any previous research on this topic, is related to the
achievements of its citizens in international athletic competitions. The performance of a
country’s women in international sporting events is related to the economic opportunities
afforded them, as measured by the ratio of the labor force participation rate of women to
the labor force participation rate of men. This result is consistently obtained in
regressions in which we control for population and per capita income, as well as the
athletic success of a country’s men, a variable that can capture a range of unobservable
factors that reflect a country’s commitment to sports. We also provide evidence that the
explanatory power of the ratio of labor force participation rates on women’s athletic

Studies of the determinants of the success of a country’s athletes at the Summer Olympics include the
analyses of the 1964 games by Donald W. Ball (1972), the 1972 games by Ned Levine (1974) and by A.
Ray Grimes, William J. Kelly and Paul H. Rubin (1974), a panel of 24 Summer Olympiads over the period
1896 to 2000 by Gerard Kuper and Elmer Sterken (2001a), the post-World War II Summer Olympic Games
by Daniel K.N. Johnson and Ayfer Ali (2000, 2002), and the Summer Olympic Games from 1960 to 1996
by Andrew B. Bernard and Meghan R. Busse (2000).

success is not merely reflecting the effect of the role of women in a country’s government
or its fertility rate, even though these two variables are both correlated with the ratio of
labor force participation rates and each explains, to some extent, the success of women in
international athletic competitions. These results suggest that the cross-country evidence
of the participation of women in a country’s labor force is an important reflection of their
opportunities in other areas of society as well.
These results are based on evidence from the Sydney Summer Olympics in 2000
and Women’s Soccer World Cup in 1999.2 We conduct a variety of tests, including ones
on the number and type of Olympic medals earned, the likelihood of qualifying for the
World Cup, and the number of points earned in World Cup Competition. These
competitions are well suited for our analysis since they include a much wider pool of
countries than other international sporting events, like Wimbledon or the Winter
Olympics, where competitors are typically drawn from a narrow set of industrial
countries.
The relationship between the ratio of labor force participation rates and number of
Olympic medals won can be sizeable. For example, our estimates suggest that women
from a country at the 75th percentile of this variable won almost 3 more medals than their
sisters who hail from a country at the 25th percentile. To illustrate this, we note that
Canadian women won 7 medals in Sydney while Spanish women won 4. The main
difference between these countries is not income, or population, but the fact that Canada

There are no other studies, to my knowledge, of the economic and demographic determinants of the
success of countries in either the Women’s or Men’s Soccer World Cup competition comparable to the
ones on the determinants of success in Olympic competition.

is at the 75th percentile of the ratio of labor force participation rates of women relative to
men while Spain is at the 25th percentile.
In the next section of this paper we describe both our main measure of women’ s
relative integration in the labor force, the ratio of labor force participation rates, and our
cross-country indicators of women’s international athletic performance. We also provide
some statistics on both of these variables and their relationship in this section. We then
present a more complete analysis of the relationship between the performance of a
country’s women in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics and its ratio of labor force
participation rates. This is followed by a similar analysis using data from the 1999
Women’s World Cup. Section V offers some concluding comments.

II. Labor Force Participation and Athletic Performance: A First Look
The central idea of this paper is that cross-country evidence of women’s
performance in international athletic competition reflects differences across countries in
women’s economic opportunities, as manifested by their relative rates of participation in
a nation’s labor market.3 In this section, we describe the main sets of variables used to
test this hypothesis. Some initial statistics on the relationship between women’s presence
in the labor market and their performance in international athletic competition, presented
at the end of this section, serve as a warm-up for the regression analysis that follows in
the next two sections.

3

It would be desirable to use in this analysis, in addition to the ratio of labor force participation rates, a
variable that reflects the ratio of women’s wages to men’s wages, controlling for differences in human
capital across the sexes, but there is no series like this available for a wide cross-section of countries.

II.A . Labor Market Participation
In a survey article on women’s labor force participation and economic
development, Kristin Mammen and Christina Paxson (2000) write “Women’s labor force
status relative to that of men is an important benchmark of their status in society.” (p.
141). The World Bank Development Indicators 2001 volume echoes this idea with the
text accompanying the table presenting the ratio of labor force participation rates of
women relative to that of men, which reads “Girls in many developing countries are
allowed less education than boys are – a disparity reflected in lower female primary
enrollment and higher female illiteracy. As a result, women have fewer employment
opportunities, especially in the formal sector.” (p. 23).
In this paper, we use the 1999 value of the ratio of labor force participation rates
(which we call LaborRatio) as an indicator of women’s economic opportunities in a
country in that year. This ratio represents the rate of economically active women relative
to the rate of economically active men.4 The distribution of this variable is depicted in
the histogram in Figure 1. This histogram reflects the fact that 73 countries, representing
almost half the sample, had a value of LaborRatio less than 0.72. Another 45 percent of
the sample, representing 68 countries, had a value of LaborRatio between 0.72 and 0.91,
and the remaining 8 countries, with a value of LaborRatio greater than 0.91, were all
countries with levels of income per capita of less than $800 in 1999. We note that the
World Development Indicators 2001 includes the remark that a value of unity of

4

The International Labor Organization defines the economically active population as all those who supply
labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period, including both the employed and
the unemployed.

4

LaborRatio indicates gender equality. But only 2 of the 149 countries in this sample,
Cambodia and Ghana, have values of LaborRatio equal to or greater than 1.5
While the eight countries with the highest values of the ratio of labor force
participation rates all had low levels of income per capita, the 26 countries in the sample
with a value of LaborRatio below 0.52 (the value for Ireland) all had levels of income per
capita below $8,100, and 22 of these countries had a level of income per capita below
$4,000. Mammen and Paxson (2000) show that, across countries, there is a U-shaped
relationship between the rate of women participating in the labor force and the logarithm
of income per capita. As shown in Figure 2, a similar relationship holds for LaborRatio
and the logarithm of income per capita in our sample of 149 countries. The solid line in
this figure represents the estimated relationship between LaborRatio and two regressors,
the logarithm of income per capita and the squared value of the logarithm of income per
capita. The estimated regression result is
LaborRatio = 2.11 – 0.36 lnGDPcap + 0.02 lnGDPcap2
where lnGDPcap is the natural logarithm of income per capita. The coefficients on both
income and income squared are significant at better than the 99 percent level of
confidence and the R2 of this regression is 0.13.
The minimum point of the quadratic function corresponds to a level of income per
capita of about $3700, which is close to the levels of income per capita for Mexico and
Botswana. At this level of income, the estimated value of LaborRatio is 0.63. In fact, the
lowest values of LaborRatio among the countries in our data set are well below this, with
5

The correlations between LaborRatio, which is calculated using 1999 values of the labor force
participation rates, and the same ratios calculated with data for 1994, 1989, and 1979 are 0.998, 0.995 and
0.945, respectively, for the 149 countries used in the analysis of the Olympics. The results reported in the

5

0.23 for Saudi Arabia, 0.32 for Belize, and 0.33 for Jordan. The three countries with the
highest values of LaborRatio in our data set are Tanzania (0.95), Cambodia (1.00) and
Ghana (1.01), all of which had annual income per capita in 1999 of less than $500.
Consistent with the U-shaped fitted relationship between LaborRatio and the logarithm of
income per capita, richer countries are also counted among those with the highest levels
of the ratio of labor force participation rates. For example, seven rich countries had a
value of LaborRatio greater than 0.80, including the United States (0.82), Canada (0.82),
Iceland (0.84), Denmark (0.85), Norway (0.85), Finland (0.88) and Sweden (0.90).

II.B Performance in International Athletic Events
One criterion in the choice of indicators used in this paper to measure national
athletic performance is to select variables that allow for the widest possible set of
countries in our data set. Therefore, we use the results of the Summer Olympics and the
Women’s World Cup. We use two variables reflecting the outcomes of the 2000
Sydney Olympics and two variables indicating performance in the 1999 Women’s World
Cup. The two Olympic variables are Medals, which is the number of Olympic medals
won by women, and MedalPoints, a point-weighted measure of the number of Olympic
medals won by women, where a gold medal counts as 5 points, a silver medal as 3 points,
and a bronze medal as 1 point.6 The two measures reflecting the outcome of the 1999

rest of this paper are virtually identical to those obtained by replacing LaborRatio with an average of the
labor force participation rates in 1979, 1989 and 1999.
6

Grimes, Kelley and Rubin (1974), Levine (1974), and Bernard and Busse (2000) do not distinguish across
types of medals while Ball (1972) used weights of 3, 2 and 1 for gold, silver and bronze, Johnson and Ali
(2000) used an ordered probit model and Kuper and Sterken (2001a) ran separate regressions for each type
of medal. While counting medals in most cases is straightforward, some clarification is worth noting. A
team medal counts as one medal for a country. A medal in mixed doubles badminton counts as a medal for
a woman (there is no mixed doubles in Olympic tennis). In several events (especially Judo) there were ties

6

Women’s World Cup competition are Cup99, a dummy variable that takes the value of 1
if a country qualified for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and otherwise equals 0, and
Cup99Points, a variable that adds to the values of Cup99, for the sixteen countries that
qualified for the Women’s World Cup, the number of points earned in competition,
where a win is worth 3 points, a draw is worth 1 point and a loss is worth 0 points.
Some initial statistics showing the relationship between LaborRatio and each of
the four measures of international athletic performance are presented in Table 1. Each
row of this table represents the sum of the values of Medals, MedalPoints, Cup99, and
Cup99Points for the set of countries in one of the quartiles of LaborRatio. Note that the
values of LaborRatio that define the quartiles differ somewhat between the 149 countries
that competed in the Sydney Summer Olympics for which we have complete data and the
54 countries that were involved in the 1999 Women’s World Cup competition for which
we have complete data.7
Medals were awarded to women from 59 different countries at the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney. We have data on labor force participation rates, and other
regressors used in our subsequent analysis, for 55 of these countries, as well as for 94
other countries whose women participated in Sydney but did not win any medals.8 Table
1 shows that the countries that had values of LaborRatio in the lowest quartile (that is,

and each medal was counted – for example, two bronze medals were awarded in Women’s Extra
Lightweight Class in Judo, one to a Belgian woman and one to a German woman, and this was recorded as
a bronze medal for each country.
7
The 54 countries used in the analysis of the World Cup represent 53 countries that attempted to qualify for
World Cup plus the United States that, by virtue of being the host country, was automatically awarded one
of the 16 qualifying slots. As discussed below, 6 other countries that competed in the World Cup
qualifying rounds (but not the World Cup itself) could not be included in our analysis because of missing
data.

The four countries whose women won medals but for which we do not have complete data are Cuba,
North Korea, Taiwan, and Yugoslavia.

7

between 0.22 and 0.56) won about one-seventh the number of medals of the countries in
the next highest quartile (which had values of LaborRatio between 0.56 and 0.73), about
one-tenth the number of medals won by countries in the third quartile (which had values
of LaborRatio between 0.73 and 0.84), and about one-eighth the number of medals won
by countries in the highest quartile (which had values of LaborRatio between 0.84 and
1.01). The disparity across quartiles in the sum of the values of MedalPoints is even
more pronounced, especially when comparing the lowest quartile to the two highest
quartiles. One reflection of this is that women from countries in the lowest quartile won
20 gold medals while women from countries in the third quartile won 47 gold medals and
women from countries in the highest quartile won 42 gold medals.
The relative shortfall in performance among countries in the lowest quartile of
LaborRatio is also apparent in the two variables related to the 1999 Women’s World
Cup. Only two countries in the lowest quartile of this set of 54 countries (Brazil, the
country at the 25th percentile in terms of the value of LaborRatio, and Mexico), and two
countries in the second quartile (Nigeria and Italy) qualified for the competition in 1999,
with the other twelve teams that qualified coming from countries with values of
LaborRatio above the median value of 0.67. Teams from countries in the highest quartile
earned, collectively, the most points. This reflects the fact that more teams came from
this quartile than any of the lower ones as well as the fact that the average number of
points earned by a team from this quartile was larger than the average number of points
earned by a team from any of the lower quartiles.
The U-shaped relationship between LaborRatio and income per capita suggests
that the set of countries in the quartile with the highest values of LaborRatio are drawn

8

from both the richest and the poorest countries in the sample. The patterns presented in
Table 1 are all the more striking since they do not control for per capita income, an
important determinant of the success of a country’s athletes in international sporting
events. In the next section we investigate the effect of LaborRatio on the success of a
country’s women in the Summer Olympics, controlling for income per capita as well as
other factors.

III. Labor Force Participation and Olympic Success
The Summer Olympics draws participants from more countries than any other
single athletic event. The athletes at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics represented 199
countries and territories. Women represented 38 percent of the 10,651 athletes at the
Sydney Games. Out of the 290 events at the 2000 Summer Olympics, 118 events (41
percent) were exclusively for women.
The success of a country’s women at the Summer Olympics can be explained by a
number of factors. The focus this paper is whether this success reflects the relative
economic opportunities of women in a country’s labor market, as indicated by its value of
LaborRatio, and our empirical specifications includes this variable. We also include a
variable that measures the success of a country’s men in the Olympics. This variable
helps to control for a range of unobserved factors that reflect the overall commitment of a
country to Olympic sports. As explained in more detail below, this variable takes
different forms, depending upon the empirical specification, in order to match it to the
particular test for women’s success in the Olympics. Finally, all specifications also
include two other variables that have been shown in the research cited above to be

9

important determinants of the overall success of a country’s athletes at the Summer
Olympics. The logarithm of a country’s population between the ages of 15 and 64 in
1999 (lnPop) reflects the size of the initial pool of talent from which elite athletes are
drawn. We also include the logarithm of a country’s income per capita in 1999
(lnGDPcap) as another regressor since the quality of the pool of potential athletes is a
function of the overall physical well-being of the country’s population as well as the
resources devoted to athletic pursuits, both of which are likely to be positively correlated
with income.9
Table 2 includes three different sets of tests of the influence of LaborRatio on the
success of a country’s women at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The first tests
(Regressions 1 – 3 in Table 2) are probit regressions in which the dependent variable
distinguishes between countries whose women won at least one medal and those
countries whose women won no medals. In these regressions, the variable AnyMen,
representing the success of a country’s men at the Olympics, is also dichotomous, taking
the value 1 if any men from a country won a medal and otherwise taking the value 0. The
next tests (Regressions 4 – 6 in Table 2) are tobit regressions in which the dependent
variable is Medals, described above. These regressions include the regressor MedalsMen,
representing the number of medals won by a country’s men. The final three regressions
presented in Table 2 (Regressions 7 – 9) also use tobit, but in this case the dependent
variable is MedalPts, described above. These regressions include a variable representing
the medal points earned by a country’s men, MedalPtsMen.
The significance of the control variables, lnGDPcap, lnPop, and the variables
representing the success of a country’s men in the Olympics, on the probability of a
9

A data appendix at the end of the paper discusses the variables used in the analysis.
10

country’s women winning at least one medal, on the number of medals won by a
country’s women, and on the weighted value of the number of medals won by a country’s
women is demonstrated in columns 1, 4 and 7, respectively, of Table 2. In each case, the
coefficients on all three of the variables included in the regressions are highly significant,
with p-values less than 0.02 for all coefficients.
Our main interest, however, in on the regressions that include LaborRatio. The
results presented in columns 2, 5 and 8 augment those in columns 1,4, and 7,
respectively, with this variable. In each of these three regressions, the coefficient on
LaborRatio is significant, with p-values of about 0.01 or better.
The point estimate of 10.08 in the tobit regression on the number of medals won
(Column 5) suggests that women from a country at the 75th percentile of LaborRatio
earned 2.82 more medals than their sisters from a country at the 25th percentile solely by
virtue of the difference in the relative labor force participation rates (since 2.82 = 10.08 x
(0.84 – 0.56 )). This is a notable amount since there were 21 countries whose women
won only 1 medal and another 24 whose women won between 2 and 8. This is also
comparable to the ceteris paribus effects of population and income per capita since the
differences between the estimated numbers of medals won by women from a country at
the 75th percentile and a country at the 25th percentile for these two variables are 2.96 for
income per capita and 3.67 for population.
Column 8 of Table 2 present an estimate of the effect of LaborRatio on the medal
points earned by women. This estimate suggests that women from a country that has a
value of LaborRatio at the 75th percentile value will earn 8.01 more medal points (28.59 x
(0.84 – 0.56 )) than women from a country that is otherwise identical but for having a

11

value of LaborRatio at the 25th percentile value. The comparable estimates for the
differences between the estimated numbers of medal points won by women from a
country at the 75th percentile and a country at the 25th percentile of income per capita and
population are 7.60 and 10.20, respectively.

III.A Robustness
One possible concern with these results is that our measure of the integration of
women in the workforce, LaborRatio, is serving as a proxy for other features of a
country. For example, we may suspect that those countries that have a higher proportion
of women in the labor force may also have a greater presence of women in the
government. In this case, it may be that a higher representation of women in government
is associated greater support of women’s athletics and this, in turn, contributes to the
performance of a country’s women in the Summer Olympics. In addition, we may
suspect that a higher relative labor force participation rate reflects a lower fertility rate,
which means that more young women have the opportunity to participate in sports rather
than raise children.10 This could also contribute to the success of a country’s women at
the Olympics.
We test for the robustness of LaborRatio to the presence of these variables by
augmenting the specification discussed above with two variables, the percentage of
women in all levels of a country’s government, WomenGov, and the fertility rate of

10

In fact, augmenting the relative labor force participation rate equation presented in Section II with the
variables WomenGov and Fertility described in the next paragraph results in the estimated relationship
LaborRatio = 2.87 – 0.50 lnGDPcap + 0.03 lnGDPcap2 + 0.004 WomenGov – 0.04 Fertility
This regression is run on data from 146 countries and the R2 is 0.22. All the coefficients in this equation
are significant at better than the 95 percent level of confidence.

12

women in a country, Fertility. 11 These results are reported in Columns 3, 6 and 9 of
Table 2. In each case, the coefficient on LaborRatio is smaller when WomenGov and
Fertility are included in the regression, confirming, to some extent, our concern.
However, the p-values on the coefficient on LaborRatio are 0.035, 0.027 and 0.08 in the
regressions in columns 3, 6, and 9, respectively, showing that LaborRatio has a
significant effect on the probability of a country’s women winning at least one medal, on
the number of medals won by a country’s women, and on the weighted value of the
number of medals won by a country’s women, even when including these two variables.
We also conducted robustness tests by including three different dummy variables;
one denoting countries that were members of the former Soviet Union, one denoting
other countries in Eastern Europe, and one denoting the host country, Australia.12 In a
tobit regression of the number of medals won by a country’s women that includes these
three dummy variables, as well as those included in the specification in Column 6 of
Table 2, the coefficient on LaborRatio is 8.32 (which is larger than the value of the
coefficient reported in Column 6) and its p-value is 0.017. This increase in the value of
the coefficient on LaborRatio with the inclusion of these three regional dummy variables
also occurs in a tobit regression in which the dependent variable is MedalPts. In this
case, augmenting the specification reported in Column 9 with the three regional dummy
variables results in an estimated coefficient on LaborRatio of 21.82, with a p-value of
11

The effect of LaborRatio on the probability of a country’s women winning any medals, on the number of
medals won by a country’s women, or on the number of medal points earned by a country’s women is
virtually the same whether we use WomenGov or, alternatively, the percentage of women in ministerial
level positions or the percentage of women in sub-ministerial positions, two other variables available in the
Human Development Report.
12

Grimes, Kelly and Rubin (1974), Bernard and Busse (2000), Johnson and Ali (2000), and Kuper and
Sterken (2001a) control membership in the former Soviet bloc and whether a country is hosting the games.

13

0.058. A probit regression like the one presented in Column 3 that drops Australia and
also includes two dummy variables, one for Eastern European countries and another for
countries that were former members of the Soviet Union, yields a point estimate of 2.57
for the coefficient on LaborRatio, with a p-value of 0.03.

III.B Individual Events versus Team Events
We close this section with an investigation of whether the effect of LaborRatio on
the number of medals won by women differs across team and individual events. There
were 260 medals awarded for individual events to women from the 149 countries
included in our data set, and 100 medals awarded to teams that included women. Table 3
presents tobit regressions in which the dependent variable is either the number of medals
won by women in individual events (in Columns 1 and 2) or the number of medals won
by teams that included women (in Columns 3 and 4). Thus, these regressions take the
form of those presented in Columns 5 and 6 of Table 2.
The results presented in Table 3 suggest that there is a slightly larger effect of
LaborRatio on the number of medals won by women in individual events than on the
number of medals won by women in team events, but this difference is not statistically
significant. The coefficient on LaborRatio is significant at better than the 97 percent
level in the regressions reported in Columns 1, 2 and 3. Only the results in Column 4 fail
to present a significant coefficient for LaborRatio. But in this regression, the F-test of the
joint significance of the coefficients on LaborRatio and Fertility has a p-value of 0.03,
while the p-values for the individual coefficients are 0.12 and 0.09, respectively.

In addition, we also used a dummy variable that indicated whether a country was predominantly Muslim
and found that this was insiginificant and its inclusion did not alter the estimated effect of LaborRatio.

14

We next turn to an analysis of relative labor force participation rates on the
outcome of an event that includes only team competition, the Women’s Soccer World
Cup.

IV. Labor Force Participation and the Women’s World Cup
Like many other team sports, recent years have seen an increase in women’s
participation in soccer. One reflection of this was the institution of the Women’s World
Cup in 1992. In the run-up to the third Women’s World Cup, which was held in the
United States in 1999, national teams from 59 countries and territories competed for the
fifteen available slots in the competition.13
In this section we demonstrate that the relative labor force participation rate is a
significant determinant of both the likelihood of a women’s national soccer team
qualifying for one of the available slots in the Women’s World Cup competition in 1999
and the performance of those 16 teams that participated in the World Cup. This effect
holds while controlling for factors similar to those that determine the success of a
country’s women in the Olympics, including population and income per capita. In
addition, we may think that some countries are more devoted to soccer than others, so we
also include as a regressor a dummy variable indicating whether a country’s men’s soccer
team qualified for the 1998 World Cup (Cup98Men).
The first four columns of Table 4 present probit estimates of the likelihood of a
country’s team qualifying for the 1999 Women’s World Cup. The countries included in
the analysis include those that competed for a slot in the World Cup and for which we

13

The United States, as host country, was automatically awarded one slot.

15

have complete data. The United States, which automatically qualified for a slot, is not
included in these estimates. The estimates in Columns 1, 2 and 4 do not include North
Korea, a country that did qualify for the 1999 Women’s World Cup, since there is no
available data on its income per capita. To check for the possible influence of North
Korea on the results, Column 3 presents a specification without income per capita which
does include an observation for North Korea.14
The estimate presented in Column 1 includes the control variables lnGDPcap,
lnPop, and Cup98Men. The p-values of the coefficient on lnPop and lnGDPcap are
0.004 and 0.099, respectively, while the coefficient on Cup98Men is not significant. The
estimate presented in Column 2 introduces LaborRatio, and the coefficient on this
variable is a significant at better than the 99 percent level of confidence. The pseudo-R2
of the regression rises from 0.21 to 0.37 with the inclusion of LaborRatio. Furthermore,
the inclusion of LaborRatio makes the coefficient on lnGDPcap insignificant. We drop
lnGDPcap from the specification in the estimate reported in Column 3, which allows us
to include North Korea as an observation. In this case, the coefficient on LaborRatio has
a p-value of 0.001. The results presented in Column 4 show that the significant effect of
LaborRatio on the probability of a country’s team qualifying for the World Cup is robust
to the inclusion of WomenGov and Fertility in the regression, with a p-value of the
coefficient on LaborRatio equal to 0.009 in this case.
Columns 5 through 8 of Table 4 presents tobit estimates in which the dependent
variables is Cup99Points (which represents 1 + the number of points earned in World
14

Six other countries and territories that competed in tournaments to qualify could not be included because
of a lack of data on population. These include Guam, Taiwan, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Tonga, and
Western Samoa. Hong Kong does not have data on the percentage of women in government, so it is not
included in the regressions in Columns 4 and 8 of Table 4.

Cup Competition, as discussed in Section II).15 LaborRatio is a significant determinant
of this variable, as shown in the results in Columns 6 through 8, with p-values of less
than 0.01 in all three cases. The inclusion of LaborRatio raises the pseudo-R2 from 0.12
(as shown by the results in Column 5) to 0.21.16
The effect of LaborRatio on the number of points earned in World Cup
competition is also evident when we restrict the sample to the 16 teams that qualified for
the event in 1999. We regress the number of points won by a team that participated in
the World Cup (i.e. Cup99Points – 1) against LaborRatio, Cup98Men and lnPop,
dropping lnGDPcap and WomenGov as regressors since data on these variables are not
available for North Korea. The estimated relationship is
(Cup99Points –1) =

-81.86 + 34.76 LaborRatio + 7.60 Cup98Men +

where robust standard errors appear in parentheses below the coefficient values, bold
represents a coefficient significant at better than the 95 percent level of confidence, and
italic represents a coefficient significant at between the 90 percent and 95 percent levels
of confidence. The R2 of this regression is 0.50. Figure 3 presents a visual depiction of

Adding 1 to the number of points earned in World Cup competition enables us to distinguish between
Mexico and Denmark, two countries whose teams qualified for the World Cup but lost all their games, and
other countries whose teams did not qualify for the World Cup.
16

As a robustness check of both the probit and tobit estimates, we augmented the specifications that include
WomenGov and Fertility with two dummy variables, one representing countries that were members of the
former Soviet Union and one representing countries that are predominantly Muslim. The coefficient on
LaborRatio is 6.67 and its p-value is 0.014 in a probit regression that includes these two dummy variables
as well as the other variables included in the specification reported in Column 4. A tobit regression that
includes these two dummy variables as well as the others included in the specification of Column 8 has a
coefficient on LaborRatio of 45.93 with a p-value below is 0.001. In neither case are the dummy variables
significant.

the ceteris paribus effect of LaborRatio on the number of points earned in the 1999
Women’s World Cup with a partial regression leverage plot of this relationship.17
The pattern of significance of the other variables included in Table 4 bears
mention. There is a significant effect of Cup98Men in the tobit regressions, with p-values
of 0.07, 0.02 and 0.02 in the estimates reported in Columns 6, 7, and 8, respectively. The
importance of this variable is less pronounced in the probit regressions. Population is a
significant determinant of the number of points earned by teams in World Cup
competition in all specifications reported in Table 4. The coefficient on WomenGov is
significant at the 93 percent level of confidence in the regression reported in Column 4,
and at better than the 99 percent level of confidence in the regression reported in Column
8. Neither the estimates in Column 4 nor those in Column 8 include a significant effect
of Fertility. Interestingly, the estimate in Column 4 of Table 3 also did not indicate that
Fertility is a significant determinant of the number of medals won by teams in the
Summer Olympics, although there is a significant effect of this variable on the number of
individual medals. Perhaps this is linked to the fact that the average age of women in
individual sports, like swimming or gymnastics, is lower than the average age of women
in team sports.

V. Conclusion
This paper demonstrates a link between an economic and social feature of
countries, the relative labor force participation rate of women, and a high-profile
characteristic, the performance of women in international sports competitions. Countries
in which women participate more fully in the labor force tend to be ones whose women
performed better in the Sydney Summer Olympics in 2000, and whose women’s teams
both were more likely to qualify for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and performed better
in this event. This effect holds when controlling for factors shown, in other research, to
determine national Olympic success, like income per capita and population. In addition
to these variables, we also control for the athletic success of a country’s men, the rate of
participation of women in government and the fertility rate.
These demonstrated statistical relationships, between relative labor force
participation and athletic success, are silent as to causes. It is reasonable to conjecture,
however, that societies in which women have greatere economic opportunities are ones
that enable athletically talented women to reach their full potential. In these societies,
women are more likely to be able to succeed in both work and play.
