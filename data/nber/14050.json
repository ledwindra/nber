    "abstract": "\n\nThe focus of policy reform in developing countries has moved from getting prices right to getting institutions right, and accordingly countries are increasingly being advised to move towards \"best-practice\" institutions.  This paper argues that appropriate institutions for developing countries are instead \"second-best\" institutions -- those that take into account context-specific market and government failures that cannot be removed in short order.  Such institutions will often diverge greatly from best practice.  The argument is illustrated using examples from four areas: contract enforcement, entrepreneurship, trade openness, and macroeconomic stability.\n\n",
