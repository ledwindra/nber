    "abstract": "\n\nWe describe and present time series evidence on the leveraged buyout / private equity industry, both firms and transactions.  We discuss the existing empirical evidence on the economics of the firms and transactions.  We consider similarities and differences between the recent private equity wave and the wave of the 1980s.  Finally, we speculate on what the evidence implies for the future of private equity.\n\n",
