    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies expectations of capital appreciation in the housing market.  We show that expectations impounded in the rent/price ratio at the beginning of the decade successfully predict appreciation rates, but only if we first control for cross-sectional differences in the quality of rental versus owner-occupied housing.  We also demonstrate that observed rent/price ratios contain a disequilibrium component that also has power to forecast subsequent appreciation rates.  Finally, we provide evidence consistent with euphoria: participants in housing markets appear to overreact to income growth.\n\n",
