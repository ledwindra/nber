    "abstract": "\n\nThe amount of time married women spend in workforce has increased dramatically in the last thirty years.  This increase in labor force participation has been accompanied by changes in allocation of time to various activities in the household as well.  Since the proportion of women in the labor force has been rising, the average amount of time input to household tasks by all women has been declining over the last 50 years.  It is valuable to analyze this in the household production context: women choose not simply between work and leisure but between work in the home, work in the market and leisure.  This paper  will use time budget data to try to determine how women's education levels affect time allocation to various activities.\n\n",
