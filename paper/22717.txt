Putting the Pension Back in 401(k) Plans: Optimal versus Default Longevity Income Annuities

ABSTRACT
Most defined contribution pension plans pay benefits as lump sums, yet the US Treasury has
recently encouraged firms to protect retirees from outliving their assets by converting a portion of
their plan balances into longevity income annuities (LIA). These are deferred annuities which
initiate payouts not later than age 85 and continue for life, and they provide an effective way to
hedge systematic (individual) longevity risk for a relatively low price. Using a life cycle portfolio
framework, we measure the welfare improvements from including LIAs in the menu of plan
payout choices, accounting for mortality heterogeneity by education and sex. We find that
introducing a longevity income annuity to the plan menu is attractive for most DC plan
participants who optimally commit 8-15% of their plan balances at age 65 to a LIA that starts
paying out at age 85. Optimal annuitization boosts welfare by 5-20% of average retirement plan
accruals at age 66 (assuming average mortality rates), compared to not having access to the LIA.
We also compare the optimal LIA allocation versus two default options that plan sponsors could
implement. We conclude that an approach where a fixed fraction over a dollar threshold is
invested in LIAs will be preferred by most to the status quo, while enhancing welfare for the
majority of workers.

Putting the Pension Back in 401(k) Plans:
Optimal versus Default Longevity Income Annuities

In the US workplace, defined contribution (DC) plans have become the norm as the
primary tax-qualified mechanism helping private sector workers save for retirement. Yet most
401(k) plans do not currently offer access to lifelong income payments to cover the
decumulation or drawdown phase of the lifecycle.1 This is a concern to the extent that
financially inexperienced consumers may do a poor job handling investment and longevity risk
in their self-directed retirement accounts.2 To correct this problem, the US Department of the
Treasury recently launched an initiative to provide firms and employers “more options for
putting the pension back” into private sector defined contribution plans (Iwry 2014). This was
accompanied by an adjustment in the tax rules governing retirement plans that facilitated
lifelong payouts - not only in 401(k) plan, but also in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
and 403(b) tax-sheltered annuities for employees of nonprofit employers, by converting
retirement assets into longevity income annuities (LIAs).3 These are deferred life annuities that
start payouts at an advanced age (e.g., age 85) and continue for life. Such instruments provide
a low-cost way to hedge the risk of outliving one’s assets.
This paper develops a realistic life cycle model to quantify the potential impact of this
new policy for a range of retiree types, differentiated by sex, educational level, and preferences.
Taking account of real-world income tax rules, Social Security contribution and benefit rules,
and the RMD regulations, we first evaluate how much participants will optimally elect to

1
Benartzi, Previtero, and Thaler (2011) note that only about one-fifth of U.S. defined contribution plans currently
offer annuities as a payout option; a small survey of 22 plan record-keepers by the US GAO (2016: 13) concluded
that few plans currently offer participants ways to “help them secure lifetime income in retirement.” Most
innovation in the DC arena over the last decade has instead focused on the accumulation phase, with the
introduction of products to attract saving including life cycle or target date funds and the widespread adoption of
automatic 401(k) enrollment and automatic escalation of contributions (c.f. Gomes, Kotlikoff and Viceira 2008;
Poterba et al. 2007). Some countries including Germany require retirees to convert a part of their accumulated taxqualified retirement assets into a longevity annuity beginning at age 85 (see Maurer and Somova 2009 and Dus et
al. 2005).

annuitize given the opportunity to do so, when they face income, spending, and capital market
shocks, and where they also are subject to uncertainty about their lifespans. In such an
environment, we then assess how much better off they would be if their options included LIAs
in the payout menu, versus without access to them. Next, we compare this case with what would
happen if the plan sponsor were to default a certain percentage of retiree assets into a deferred
annuity.4 And finally, we compare the retiree’s optimal allocation to LIAs versus a default
option, taking into account mortality heterogeneity by education and sex. In this paper we use
a life cycle framework to explore the impact of including longevity income annuities in the
menu of payout choices. We measure the potential improvements in well-being resulting from
this reform, and our results indicate how the demand for these annuity products varies with
participant characteristics such as educational levels and mortality experience, while taking into
account both labor income and capital market risk. We also investigate how such products can
be implemented as a default solution analogous to how Target Date Funds (TDFs) have been
adopted during the accumulation phase.5 Most importantly, we present the anticipated welfare
implications of incorporating such products in retirement plans, taking into account realistic
income taxation and required minimum distribution rules.
It is worth noting that it is quite inexpensive to protect against running out of money
with a deferred annuity. Even in the current low interest rate environment, a deferred single life
annuity purchased at age 65 for a male (female) costing $10,000 can generate an annual benefit
flow from age 85 onward of $4,830 ($3,866) per year for life.6 This results from the investment
returns earned over the 20 years prior to the withdrawal start date, plus the accumulated survival

4

For instance Iwry (2014) illustrated the case where the retiree converts 15% of her plan assets to the deferred
annuity. Iwry and Turner (2009) explored two approaches to make deferred income annuities the default payout
approach in 401(k) plans. A US Department of Labor letter to Mark Iwry (US DOL 2014) explicitly permitted
plan sponsors to include annuity contracts as fixed income investments in a 401(k) plan.
5
The 2006 Pension Protection Act allowed plan sponsors to offer Target Date Funds as qualified default investment
alternatives in participant-directed individual account plans (US DOL nd). A 2014 Treasury/IRS Administrative
Guidance letter (IRS 2014) made clear that annuities – including deferred income annuities – could be a 401(k)
default option.

credits resulting from premiums paid by those who die earlier than expected being shared with
those who survive.
Much has been written on the economic appeal of annuities in a household context, yet
in practice few people purchase them (Brown et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2011). Explanations
point to factors such as product costs/loadings, retiree bequest motives and/or liquidity needs,
and behavioral factors including complexity.7 Yet one important reason not examined to date
has to do with institutional factors discouraging annuitization in 401(k) plans. Specifically, until
2014, US tax rules required retirees to withdraw from their retirement accounts the so-called
“Required Minimum Distribution” (RMD) amount each year from age 70.5 onward, where the
RMD was computed so that the sum of annual payouts was expected to exhaust the retiree’s
401(k) balance by the end of her life (IRS 2012b). If a retiree did purchase an annuity with her
plan assets, her RMD was still calculated taking into account the value of her annuity. This had
the unappealing consequence that the retiree might find herself needing to withdraw an amount
in excess of her liquid assets (excluding the annuity value) and be forced to pay a 50% excise
tax (Iwry 2014).
In 2014, the US Treasury decided to permit for the first time and encourage the offering
of longevity annuities within the more than $14 trillion US 401(k) and IRA markets “by
amending the required minimum distribution regulations…to provide a measure of additional
flexibility consistent with the statutory RMD provisions” (Iwry 2014).8 Approved deferred
annuities thus had to begin payouts not later than age 85 and cost less than 25% of the retiree’s
account balance (up to a limit). Under these conditions, the retiree’s annuity would no longer
be counted in determining her RMD. This policy change therefore relaxed the RMD
requirements that had effectively precluded the offering of longevity annuities in the 401(k)

7

The discrepancy between the appeal in theoretical models (see originally Yaari 1965, and more recently Davidoff
et al. 2005) and the low annuity take-up rates of households is also referred to as the ‘annuity puzzle’ (see, e.g.,
Inkmann et al., 2011).
8
Treasury had originally proposed these amendments to the regulations two years earlier, referring to the new
longevity annuities as “qualifying longevity annuity contracts” (or “QLACS”); see US Treasury 2014).

and IRA contexts. This is important because outliving one’s assets is one of the most important
risks people face, an especially critical matter in old age when one generally cannot return to
work and when healthcare costs may be large. For example, the expected remaining lifetime
for a 65-year-old US female is about 21 years using the general population statistics (Arias
2016). Yet there is considerable volatility around the mean (around nine years), implying that
individuals’ uncertainty about the length of their lifetimes will drive retirement consumption
and thus lifetime well-being.
To explore the policy, we develop a realistic life cycle model to quantify the potential
impact of this new policy for a range of retiree types, differentiated by sex, educational level,
and preferences. We take account of real-world income tax rules, Social Security contribution
and benefit rules, and the RMD regulations discussed above. Our analysis first evaluates how
much participants will optimally elect to annuitize given the opportunity to do so, when they
face income, spending, and capital market shocks, and where they also are subject to uncertainty
about their lifespans. In such an environment, we then assess how much better off they would
be if their options included LIAs in the payout menu, versus without access to them. Next, we
compare this case with what would happen if the plan sponsor were to default a certain
percentage of retiree assets into a deferred annuity.9 And finally, we compare the retiree’s
optimal allocation to LIAs versus a default option, taking into account mortality heterogeneity
by education and sex.
To preview our findings, we show that introducing a longevity income annuity to the
plan menu is quite attractive to the majority of DC plan participants. Overall, older individuals
would optimally commit 8-15% of their plan balances at age 65 to a LIA which begins payouts
at age 85. When participants can select their own optimal annuitization rates, welfare increases
by 5-20% of average retirement plan accruals as of age 66 (assuming average mortality rates)

For instance Iwry (2014) illustrated a case where the retiree converted 15% of her plan assets to the deferred
annuity.

compared to not having access to LIAs. If, instead, plan sponsors were to default participants
into deferred annuities using 10% of their retirement age plan assets, this would reduce retiree
wellbeing only slightly compared to the optimum. Results are less positive for those with
substantially higher mortality vis a vis population averages; for such individuals, using a fixed
percentage default rule generates lower welfare since annuity prices based on average mortality
rates are too high. Converting retirement assets into a longevity annuity only for those having
over $65,000 in their retirement accounts overcomes this problem. Accordingly, we conclude
that including well-designed LIA defaults in DC plans yields quite positive consequences for
401(k)-covered workers. Moreover, our findings also apply to Individual Retirement Account
payout designs, since the RMD rules for these accounts are nearly the same as those for 401(k)
plans.
In what follows, we describe our life cycle model and explain how we use it to study
optimal consumption, investment, and annuitization decisions. The model includes a realistic
formulation of US income tax rules, required minimum distribution rules for 401(k)-plans,
payroll taxes for Social Security benefits, and rules for claiming retirement benefits. In addition,
we report the possible welfare implications having access to LIAs. Sensitivity analyses illustrate
how results vary across a range of parameters including uninsurable labor income profiles, sex,
and preferences. Next, we discuss the impact of alternative default rules for retirement asset
annuitization. A final section concludes.

Deferred Longevity Income Annuities in a Life Cycle Model: Methodology
Our dynamic portfolio and consumption model time posits an individual who decides
over her life cycle how much to consume optimally and how much to invest in stocks, bonds,
and annuities.10 We model utility as depending on consumption, while constraints include a

realistic characterization of income profiles, taxes, and the opportunity to invest (to a limit) in
a 401(k)-type tax-qualified retirement plan. At retirement (set here at age 66), the individual
determines how much of her retirement account she wishes to convert to a deferred longevity
income annuity, as well as how much she will retain in liquid stocks and bonds. We also take
into account the Required Minimum Distribution rules relevant to the US 401(k) setting, as well
as a realistic formulation of Social Security benefits. In a subsequent section, we provide
additional robustness analysis on different preferences and mortality heterogeneity across
educational categories.
Preferences. We build a discrete-time dynamic consumption and portfolio choice model for
utility-maximizing investors over the life cycle. The individual’s decision period starts at ‫ ݐ‬ൌ

The Budget Constraint during the Work Life. While working, the individual has the
opportunity to invest a part (‫ܣ‬௧ ሻof her uncertain pre-tax salary ܻ௧ (to an annual limit of

The $18,000 limit was the legal limit on tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) plans in 2016, and if permitted by
the plan, employees age 50+ can make additional 401(k) catch-up contributions of $6,000 per year.

During her work life, the individual also pays taxes, which reduce her cash on hand available
for consumption and investment.13 First, labor income is reduced by 11.65% (݀௪ ), which is the

sum of the Medicare (1.45%), city/state (4%), and Social Security (6.2%) taxes. In addition, the
worker also must pay income taxes (ܶܽ‫ݔ‬௧ାଵ ሻaccording to US federal progressive tax system

Prior to retirement, her retirement plan assets are invested in bonds which earn the risk-

(‫ܮ‬௧ାଵ ) of her 401(k) assets at time ‫ ݐ‬൅ ͳ is therefore determined by her previous period’s value,

According to the 2014 US Treasury rules, the present value of the LIA is excluded when
determining the retiree’s RMD. However, benefit payments from the LIA from age 85 are
subject to income taxes. During retirement, Social Security benefits are taxed (up to certain
limits)17 at the individual federal income tax rate as well as the city/state tax rate. Payouts from
the 401(k) plan are given by:

Moreover, the RMD rules require that 401(k) participants take minimum withdrawals from their
plans from age 70.5 onwards, defined as a specified age-dependent percentage (݉௧ ) of plan

assets, or else they must pay a substantial tax penalty. Accordingly, to avoid the excise penalty,

plan payouts must be set so ݉‫ܮ‬௧ ൑ ܹ௧ ൏  ‫ܮ‬௧ .

Model Calibration: Our base case parameters are consistent with those used in prior work on
life-cycle portfolio choice.18 For the utility function, we set the coefficient of relative risk
aversion Uto 5; the time discount rate ȕ is 0.96 and the leisure preference parameter equals 1.2.
Survival rates entering into the utility function are for the US Population Life Table (from Arias
2010). For annuity pricing, we use the US Annuity 2000 mortality table provided by the Society

The Social Security benefit formula is a piece-wise linear function of the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings

of Actuaries (SOA nd). Annuity survival rates are higher than those for the general population,
because they take into account adverse selection among annuity purchasers.19 Social Security
old age benefits are based on the 35 best years of income and the bend points as of 2013 (SSA
nd). Thus the annual Primary Insurance Amounts (or the unreduced Social Security benefits)
equal 90 percent of (12 times) the first $791 of average indexed monthly earnings, plus 32
percent of average indexed monthly earnings over $791 and through $4,768, plus 15 percent of
average indexed monthly earnings over $4,768.20 Required minimum distributions (RMD) from
401(k)-plans are based on life expectancy using the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table 2013. Federal
income taxes are calculated using the tax-brackets given for the year 2013 (for details see
Appendix B).
Our financial market parameterizations include a risk-free interest rate of 1% and an
equity risk premium of 4% with a return volatility of 18%. The labor income process during the
work life has both a permanent and transitory component, with uncorrelated and normally
distributed shocks as ሺ୲ ሻ ̱ሺെͲǤͷɐଶ୬ ǡ ɐଶ୬ ሻ and ሺ୲ ሻ ̱ሺെͲǤͷɐଶ୳ ǡ ɐଶ୳ ሻ. Following

Hubener et al. (2016), we estimate the deterministic component of the wage rate process ‫ݓ‬௦ǡ௧

along with the variances of the permanent and transitory wage shocks ܰ௧௜ and ܷ௧௜ using the

1975–2013 waves of the PSID.21 These are estimated separately by sex and for three education
levels: for high school dropouts, high school graduates, and those with at least some college
(<HS, HS, Coll+).22 Wages rates are converted into yearly income by assuming a 40 hour work
week and 52 weeks of employment per year. Results appear in Figure 1, where panel A reports
for the three different educational groups the expected income profiles for females and panel B
for males, respectively. For all cases, the labor income pattern follows the typical hump-shaped
profile in expectation. At age 66, on retirement, the worker receives a combined income stream

from her 401(k) pension, Social Security benefits, and from age 85 on, payments from longevity
income annuities.
Figure 1
We use dynamic stochastic programming to solve this optimization problem. For the
base case, we have five state variables: wealth (ܺ௧ ), the total value of the individual’s fund
accounts (‫ܮ‬௧ ), payments from the LIA (ܲ‫)ܣ‬, permanent income (ܲ௧ ), and time (‫)ݐ‬.23 We also

compute the individual’s consumption and welfare gains under alternative scenarios using our
modeling approach.

Results: Base Case
This section describes the individual’s optimal demand for stocks, bonds, consumption,
and saving in 401(k) plans over her life cycle; our base case focuses on the college-educated
female. We construct and compare two scenarios. In a first, no LIA is available, while in the
second, at age 65 the individual can convert some of her 401(k) account assets to the LIA that
begins paying benefits as of age 85. Subsequent sensitivity analysis compares results for people
with different lifetime income profiles.
Figure 2 displays outcomes for the base case, where expected values are based on
100,000 simulated life cycles. Panel A reports life cycle patterns where the individual lacks
access to the LIA, while Panel B presents the alternative where she does have the option to buy
additional annuities at age 25. Initially, the individual works full-time and earns an annual pretax income of $35,000 at age 25. She saves in the tax-qualified 401(k) account from her gross
salary up to a maximum of $18,000 per year (as per current law), such that at age 65, her
retirement plan assets peak at $234,416 (in expectation). Her consumption pattern (solid line)
is slightly hump-shaped. She begins withdrawing from her 401(k) beginning around age 60 (red

dotted line), when this is feasible without the 10%-penalty tax.24 After retiring at age 66, she
boosts her withdrawals substantially to compensate for the fact that her Social Security income
stream is far below her pre-retirement labor income.
Figure 2
Panel B of Figure 2 displays the life cycle profile when the same worker now has access
to the LIA. As before, her pre-tax annual earnings at age 25 are $35,000 (dashed-dotted line).
But now she has the opportunity to purchase an LIA, so she needs to save somewhat less in the
401(k) plan: $231,000 as of age 65 (in expectation). Thereafter, she reallocates $34,745 from
her 401(k) account to the LIA, at which point no taxes are payable. She also withdraws from
her 401(k) plan (red dotted line) starting at age 60, and she exhausts that account by age 85.
From age 85 onward, her LIA pays her an annual $7,789 (worth 42% of her Social Security
benefit) for the rest of her life. Also of interest is the fact that the individual having the LIA
consumes more, in expectation, compared to when she lacks access, particularly after age 85.
This is because she is insured against running out of money in old age.
Figure 3 displays the difference in consumption between the two cases, with and without
access to the LIA. The x-axis represents the individual’s age, and the y-axis the consumption
difference (in $000). We depict these in percentiles (99%; 1%) using a fan chart, where
differences are measured for each of the 100,000 simulation paths. Darker areas represent
higher probability masses, and the solid line represents the expectation. Results show that, prior
to age 85, consumption differences are small: the mean is only $3 at age 50. But by age 85, the
retiree with the longevity income annuity is able to consume about $1,000 more per year, and
$6,000 more by age 99. There is also heterogeneity in the outcomes, such that at age 25, the
difference is only $150 for the bottom quarter, while it is $1,400 for the 75th percentile. At age
99, the difference is $96 for the 25th percentile, but $9,680 for the 75th quantile.

24

Before age 59.5, the individual pays 10% penalty for each withdrawal from a 401(k) plan.

Overall, we conclude that the opportunity to purchase a longevity income annuity
provides individuals with substantially higher consumption levels, particularly at older ages.

Comparisons with Other Groups
In this section we report results for other educational groups, for men as well as women.
In addition we provide an analysis of different mortality assumptions and for a LIA with an
earlier start age.
Differences by Sex and Educational Attainment. Table 1 shows how results vary for men and
women having different educational, and hence labor earnings, patterns. To this end, we show
retirement plan assets over the life cycle for women and men in the three educational brackets
of interest here, namely high school dropouts, high school graduates, and the Coll+ group.
Panel A reports outcomes when individuals lack access to the LIA, and Panel B shows asset
values when they do have access. Panel C provides average amounts used to purchase the LIA
when available, along with the resulting lifelong benefits payable from age 85.
Table 1 here
Since the Coll+ female earns more than her female counterparts, she also saves more in
her 401(k) plan over her life cycle. For example, without a LIA, by age 55-64, the average
Coll+ woman with no LIA access saves $233,340 in her 401(k) account, over four times the
$52,470 held by the High School dropout, and double the $114,850 of the High School
graduate. With a LIA, the best-educated woman saves slightly less in her retirement account
(around $3,000 less), while the HS graduate is not much affected. Interestingly, the leasteducated female optimally saves slightly more (4%) in her 401(k) account when she can access
the LIA. A similar pattern obtains for the three cases of male savers depicted. As the Coll+
male earns more than the Coll+ female, he accumulates more in his 401(k) account, on the order
of $274,380 with no LIA. This is 80% more than the male HS graduate ($151,980), and over

14

three times the $85,090 of the HS dropout. Once access to the LIA is available, the besteducated man needs to save $10,310 less, while the HS graduate changes behavior very little
(as with the females). Again, the male HS dropout saves slightly more.
With the LIA, all groups of women and men withdraw more and retain less in their
retirement plans post-retirement, compared to those without access to lifelong benefits. For
instance, the Coll+ woman with having an LIA keep an average of $165,390 in her retirement
plan between ages 65-74, or 24% more than with the LIA when she retains only $129,230 in
investible assets. Similarly, the best-educated male age 65-74 retains $138,880 in his retirement
account with the LIA, whereas without it he keeps 23% more ($181,870). A comparable pattern
applies to the other two educational groups of both sexes. With or without the LIA, the two
less-educated men and women have very little left in their 401(k) plans close to the ends of their
lives, though they have more without the annuity than with. At very old ages, 85-94, the most
educated people with no access to the LIA still hold about $15,000 in their 401(k) accounts,
while, with the annuity, they have virtually nothing.
The reason for this difference is that those with LIA access use a substantial portion of
their retirement assets to purchase longevity annuities which generate a yearly lifelong income.
Row C in Table 1 shows that the Coll+ women optimally use about $34,750 of their 401(k)
plans to purchase their deferred annuity, and even the HS group buys annuities using $11,640.
The HS dropout group buys the least, nor surprising given the redistributive nature of the Social
Security system, spending only $3,050 on the deferred income product. Men have similar
patterns, though their shorter life expectancy motivates the least-educated to devote some
$8,300 to LIAs.
From age 85 onwards, both groups with LIAs enjoy additional income, compared to the
non-LIA group. From age 85, the Coll+ women receive an annual LIA payment for life of
$7,790, while the HS women are paid $2,610 per year. The HS dropout receives the least given
her small purchase, paying out only $680 per annum. For men, the optimal LIA purchase at 66

15

generates an annual benefit of $11,100 for the Coll+, $5,210 for HS grads, and a still relatively
high annual benefit of $2,510 for HS dropouts. In other words, the LIA pays a reasonably
appealing benefit for those earning middle/high incomes during their worklives. They are
smaller, on net, for those who earned only what HS dropouts did over their lifetimes.
Impact of Alternative Mortality Assumptions and Payout Dates. This far we have assumed that
the LIAs are priced using relevant age and sex annuitant tables, Yet it is also of interest to
explore how the demand for LIAs varies with alternative mortality assumptions, including
pricing for individuals with higher mortality rates, as well as unisex pricing. We also consider
a scenario where the LIA starts paying out younger, at age 80, instead of age 85.
Taking into account alternative mortality assumptions is interesting for two reasons.
First, recent studies report widening mortality differentials by education, which raises questions
about whether the least-educated will benefit much from longevity annuities. For instance,
Kreuger et al. (2015) report that male high school dropouts average 23% excess mortality and
females 32%, compared to high school graduates. By comparison, those with a college degree
live longer: men average a 6% lower mortality rate, and women 8%. Though only 10% of
Americans have less than a high school degree (Ryan and Bauman 2016) and they comprise
only 8% of the over-age 25 workforce (US DOL 2016), this group is more likely to be poor.
Second, employer-provided retirement accounts in the US are required to use unisex life tables
to compute 401(k) payouts (Turner and McCarthy 2013). While men’s lower survival rates may
make LIAs less attractive to men than to women, it has not yet been determined how men’s
welfare gains from accessing LIA products compare to women’s. Accordingly, in what follows,
we compare our results for the base case to those for persons anticipating shorter lifespans.
Table 2 presents results for each of these alternative scenarios. The first column
replicates outcomes for the base case female (Coll+). Columns 2 and 3 show results when
annuities for high school dropouts of both sexes are priced using higher mortality (as in Kreuger
et al. 2015). In Column 4 we report the impact of having the LIA priced using a unisex mortality

16

table, as would be true in the US company retirement plan context. Column 5 reports the impact
of assuming a shorter deferral period: that is, the LIA begins paying out at age 80 instead of age
85.
Table 2 here
Result show that when the LIAs modeled are priced using the higher mortality rates for
male and female high school dropouts, this makes them less appealing for both groups. For
instance, the female HS dropout buys a much smaller LIA at age 65 – spending only $1,401
versus $3,050 in Table 1 – which pays out much less ($320 per year versus $680 per year). The
male HS dropout also spends less on the LIA, allocating only $5,330 to the deferred product
versus $8,300; this lower LIA pays only $1,610 per annum instead of $2,510. In general, using
age/education group mortality tables does not completely erase the demand for LIAs, but it does
diminish it substantially.
Turning next to the impact of using a unisex instead of a female mortality table to price
the LIA, we find that this has little effect on outcomes. In other words, Coll+ women are almost
as well off, and would devote almost as much money to longevity income annuities, regardless
of whether sex-specific or unisex annuity life tables are used to price the LIA. Further analysis
will indicate how results change across other groups.
In Column 5 we report what happens if an earlier LIA payout is permitted, that is, at age
80 instead of age 85. Now the Coll+ woman saves slightly less ($2,000 less) than in the base
case, namely $228,970 in her 401(k) account as of age 55-64. The earlier starting age is
attractive, so at retirement she will optimally allocate $32,970 to the LIA, just a little less than
in the base case ($34,750). Her annual income payment will now be $8,470 at age 85+, 8%
more than the $7,790 under the LIA payable at age 85. In other words, having access to the
longevity payout slightly earlier does not change results dramatically.

17

Welfare Analysis
We next report the results of a welfare analysis comparing access to longevity income
annuities versus no access. To calculate the welfare gains of having access to LIAs at retirement
versus not, we compare the situation at age 66 for two sets of workers. Both behave optimally
before and after retirement, but the first has the opportunity to buy LIAs at age 65 while the
second does not. Since people are risk averse, it is not surprising that the utility level of those
having access to LIAs at age 66 is generally higher than those without. We also compute the
equivalent increase in the 401(k) wealth needed for those lacking the LIAs, to be as well off as
those with the products. Formally, we find the additional asset ሺ‫݃ݓ‬ሻ that would need to be

deposited in the 401(k) accounts of individuals lacking access to LIA, so their utility would be
equivalent to that with access to the LIA product.25 This is defined as follows:

(12)

Table 3 shows results. For the Coll+ female, access to the LIA enhances welfare by a
value equivalent to $13,120. In this circumstance, she optimally devotes 15% of her 401(k)
account to the deferred lifetime income annuity. If unisex tables were required, the fraction of
her account devoted to the LIA would change only trivially, and the welfare gain is actually
higher due to the fact that, on average, women benefit from unisex tables due to longer lifespans.
If the LIA product started payouts at age 80 instead of age 85, more retirement money would
be devoted to this product (26.7% of the account value) and the welfare gain would rise by 17%
(to $15,802).
Table 3 here
The next few rows of the table report results for different educational groups by sex.
Among women, we see that welfare is enhanced by having access to the LIA product, though
the gain of $6,280 for the HS graduates exceeds that for HS dropouts (whether population or

higher mortality rates are used). For men, we see that the gain for the Coll+ group is substantial
when LIAs are available, on the order of $35,837 as of age 66. Smaller results obtain for the
less-educated, thought even HS dropouts with the lower survival probabilities still benefit more
than women, on average.
In sum, in our framework, both women and men benefit from access to a longevity
income annuity. While workers anticipating lower lifetime earnings and lower longevity do
benefit proportionately less than the Coll+ group, all subsets examined gain from having access
to the LIA when they can optimally allocate their retirement assets to these accounts.

How Might a Default Solution for Longevity Annuity Work?
Thus far, our findings imply that a majority of 401(k) plan participants would benefit
from having access to a longevity income annuity. Nevertheless, some people might still be
unwilling or unable to commit to an LIA, even if it were sensibly priced (as here).26 For this
reason, a plan sponsor could potentially implement a payout default, wherein a portion of the
individual’s retirement plan assets would be used to automatically purchase a deferred lifetime
payout at age 65. In this way, such a default would accomplish the goal of “putting the pension
back” into the retirement plan.
One policy option along these lines would be for an employer to default a fixed fraction
– say 10% – of retirees’ 401(k) accounts into a LIA when they turn age 65. This fixed fraction
approach is compatible in spirit with the optimal default rates depicted in Table 3, where most
retirees would find such a default amount appealing. Yet some very low-earners might save so
little in their 401(k) accounts that defaulting them into a LIA might not be practical.
Accordingly, a second policy option would be to default 10% of savers’ 401(k) accounts only

26

For instance, Brown et al. (2016) show that people find annuitization decisions complex, particularly for the
least financially literate.

19

when participants had accumulated some minimum amount such as $65,000 in their plans.27 In
this second fixed fraction + threshold scenario, the LIA default is implemented when the
worker’s 401(k) account equals or exceeds the threshold. Of course, the 10% deferred
annuitization rate will still be below what some would desire in terms of the optimum, and
higher for others. Our question is, how would welfare effects change, for such default deferred
payout policies?
Our analysis of the two different default approaches appears in Table 4. The next-to-last
column reports welfare gains assuming the 10% default applies to everyone, while the last
column defaults people into LIAs only if their retirement accounts exceed $65,000. In both
cases, 10% of the assets invested by default would go to a LIA payable at age 85.
Table 4 here
For the base case Coll+ female, we see that her welfare gain from the fixed fraction
default comes to $12,810, just slightly ($310) lower than the gain in the fully optimal case in
Table 3. She still benefits under the fixed fraction approach when a unisex mortality table is
used, but it provides 23% lower welfare gain than in the full optimality case (or $3362 less than
the $14,360 in Table 3). If the LIA were available from age 80, her welfare gain under the fixed
fraction option would be just one-fourth as large as if she could buy an optimal level of LIA; in
fact holding her to a 10% fraction makes her much less well off than allowing her to devote
almost 27% to the LIA payable at age 80. Welfare gains for the fixed fraction + threshold
approach are comparable for the Coll+ woman. Accordingly, older educated women would
likely favor LIAs beginning at age 85, under both the fixed fraction and the fixed fraction +
threshold approaches.

27

This appears to be a reasonable threshold in that workers in their 60’s with at least five years on the job averaged
$68,800 or more in their 401(k) plans, as of 2014 (Vanderhei et al. 2016). The same source found that workers in
their 60s who earned $40-$60,000 per year averaged $96,400 in their 401(k) accounts; those earning $60-$80,000
per year averaged %$151,800; and those earning $80-$100,000 held an average of $223,640 in these retirement
accounts.

20

Turning to the less educated women, it is not surprising to learn that welfare gains are
lower for both of the default options. For instance, requiring the less-educated to annuitize a
fixed fraction (10%) of their 401(k) wealth reduces utility for the HS graduates using population
mortality tables by 13% (i.e., from $6,280 to $5,467), and by more, 75%, for HS dropouts (i.e.,
from $5,270 to $$1287). If mortality rates for HS dropouts were 34% higher, as noted above,
these least-educated women would actually be worse off under the fixed fraction approach. For
such individuals, the fixed fraction + threshold would be more appealing, as those with very
low incomes and low savings would be exempted from buying LIAs. In fact, HS graduates do
just about as well under this second policy option as in the optimum.
Regarding results for men, we see that the default 10% LIA has little negative impact
on their welfare. This is primarily due to their higher lifetime earnings, allowing them to save
more, as well as lower survival rates. For instance, the Coll+ male’s welfare gain in the
optimum is $35,837 (Table 3) and just a bit less, $33,032, under the fixed fraction option. The
fixed fraction + threshold default is likewise not very consequential for the best-educated male,
with welfare declining only 8% compared to the optimum. Less-educated males experience
only slightly smaller welfare gains with both default policies; indeed if they are permitted to
avoid annuitization if they have less than $65,000 in their retirement accounts, benefits are quite
close to the optimum welfare levels across the board.
Finally, we repeat or welfare analysis for the default solutions assuming that the LIAs
are priced using a unisex table instead of a sex-specific mortality table. At retirement, workers
can transfer the assets of their 401(k) company plans into an individual retirement account
(IRA) offered by a private sector financial institution. In such a case, the private sector
institution can use sex-specific mortality tables to price annuities offered inside the plan. Yet if
the worker kept her tax qualified retirement assets with the company during the decumulation
phase, the annuity must be priced using a unisex table. Table 5 depicts the results for the various
education groups if LIA’s are priced using a unisex table. For men (female), not surprisingly,

21

the welfare gains of such the default solutions decreases (increases) compared to the situation
with sex-specific annuity pricing (see Table 4). Yet the welfare gain is still remarkably high for
workers having Coll+ and High School education. Again, the simple default solution based on
a 10%-fixed percentage rule produces a small welfare cost ($ -479) for females with a high
school education and mortality rate 34% higher than the average population. The fixedpercentage rule plus an asset threshold of $ 65,000 overcomes this problem, i.e. also for this
group the welfare gains are positive ($555). Looking at other subgroups, the introduction of an
asset threshold produces welfare gains compared to the situation without the asset threshold.
In sum, this section has shown that requiring workers to devote a fixed fraction of their
401(k) accounts to longevity income annuities starting at age 85, and additionally, limiting the
requirement to savers having at least $65,000 in their retirement accounts, does not place undue
hardships on older men or women across educational groups. Moreover, this approach offers a
way for retirees to enhance their lifetime consumption, protect against running out of money in
old age, and enjoy greater utility levels than without the LIAs.

Conclusions and Implications
This paper has examined the potential impact of a recent effort to “put the pension back”
in 401(k) plans. This recent change in Treasury regulations reversed the traditional institutional
bias against including annuities as retirement plan payouts in US private-sector pension
regulation, and it now allows retirees to purchase a deferred lifetime income annuity using a
portion of their plan assets. Similar suggestions have been the subject of discussion in the
context of new state-sponsored retirement plans for the non-pensioned, now under development
in 28 states (e.g., Iwry and Turner 2009; IRS 2014).
Our analysis contributes to the policy debate by using a richly-specified life cycle model
to measure how much peoples’ wellbeing is enhanced by including LIAs in the retirement plan
menu. We take into account stochastic capital market returns, labor income streams, and

22

mortality, and we also realistically model taxes, Social Security benefits, and 401(k) rules. What
we find is that both women and men benefit in expectation from the LIAs, and even lesseducated and lower-paid persons stand to gain from this innovation. Moreover, we show that
plan sponsors wishing to integrate a deferred lifetime annuity as a default in their plans can do
so to a meaningful extent, by converting as little as 10% or 15% of retiree plan assets,
particularly if the default is implemented for workers having plan assets over a reasonable
threshold.
Financial institutions, insurance companies, and mutual fund companies are
increasingly focused on helping Baby Boomers manage their $18 trillion in assets during
retirement, so this research will interest those seeking to guide this generation as it decides how
to manage 401(k) plan assets into retirement. Similar recommendations are likewise relevant to
the management of Individual Retirement Accounts, as these too are subject to the RMD rules
and relevant tax considerations described above. Regulators concerned with enhancing
retirement security will also find useful the default LIA mechanism described here, to help
protect retirees from running out of money in old age.

Appendix A: Wage Rate Estimation
We calibrated the wage rate process using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
1975- 2013 from age 25 to 69. During the worklife, the individual’s labor income profile has
deterministic, permanent, and transitory components. The shocks are uncorrelated and normally
distributed according to ݈݊ሺܰ௧ ሻ ̱ܰሺെͲǤͷߪ௡ଶ ǡ ߪ௡ଶ ሻ and ݈݊ሺܷ௧ ሻ ̱ܰሺെͲǤͷߪ௨ଶ ǡ ߪ௨ଶ ሻ. The wage rate

values are expressed in $2013. These are estimated separately by sex and by educational level.
The educational groupings are: less than High School (<HS), High School graduate (HS), and
those with at least some college (Coll+). Extreme observations below $5 per hour and above
the 99th percentile are dropped.
We use a second order polynomial in age and dummies for employment status. The
regression function is:
ଶ
ሺ‫ݓ‬௜ǡ௬ ሻ ൌ ߚଵ ‫݁݃ܽ כ‬௜ǡ௬ ൅ ߚଶ ‫݁݃ܽ כ‬௜ǡ௬
൅ ߚହ ‫ܵܧ כ‬௜ǡ௬ ൅ ߚ௪௔௩௘௦ ‫ݏ݁݅݉݉ݑ݀ ݁ݒܽݓ כ‬ǡ

(A1)

where ሺ‫ݓ‬௜ǡ௬ ሻ is the natural log of wage at time y for individual i, age is the age of the

individual divided by 100, ES is the employment status of the individual, and wave dummies
control for year-specific shocks. For employment status we include three groups depending on
working hours per week as follows: part-time worker ( 20 hours), full-time worker (< 20 & 
40 hours) and over-time worker (< 40 hours). OLS regression results for the wage rate process
equation appear in Table A1.
To estimate the variances of the permanent and transitory components, we follow
Carroll and Samwick (1997) and Hubener at al. (2016). We calculate the difference of the
observed log wage and our regression results, and we take the difference of these differences
across different lengths of time d. For individual i, the residual is:
ௗିଵ

‫ݎ‬௜ǡௗ ൌ ෍ሺܰ௧ା௦ ሻ ൅ ܷ௜ǡ௧ାௗ െ ܷ௜ǡ௧ 
௦ୀ଴

ଶ
We then regress the ‫ݒ‬௜ௗ ൌ ‫ݎ‬തതതതത
పǡௗ on the lengths of time d between waves and a constant:


‫ݒ‬௜ௗ ൌ ߚଵ ‫ ݀ ڄ‬൅ ߚଶ ‫ ʹ ڄ‬൅ ݁௜ௗ ,

(A2)

(A3)

where the variance of the permanent factor ߪேଶ ൌ ߚଵ and the ߪ௎ଶ ൌ ߚଶ represents the variance of

the transitory shocks.

Appendix B: 401(k) plans tax-qualified pension account
We integrate a US-type progressive tax system into our model to explore the impact of
having access to a qualified (tax-sheltered) pension account of the EET type.28 Here the
household must pay taxes on labor income and on capital gains from investments in bonds and
stocks. During the working life, it invests ‫ܣ‬௧  in the tax-qualified pension account, which

reduces taxable income up to an annual maximum amount ‫ܦ‬௧ =$18,000. Correspondingly,

withdrawals ‫ܧ‬௧ from the tax-qualified account increase taxable income. Finally, the household’s

taxable income is reduced by a general standardized deduction ‫ܦܩ‬. For a single household, this
28

That is, contributions and investment earnings in the account are tax exempt ( E), while payouts are taxed (T).

deduction amounted to $5,950 per year. Consequently, taxable income in working age is given

For Social Security (ܻ௧ାଵ ) taxation up to age 66, we use the following rules: when the individual

combined income29 is between $25,000 and $34,000 (over $34,000), 50% (85%) of benefits are
taxed.30

$388,350, and 35% above $388,350 (see IRA 2012). Based on these tax brackets, the

Appendix C: Population mortality tables differentiated by education and sex
Research has shown that lower-educated individuals have lower life expectancies than
better-educated individuals. This is relevant to the debate over whether and which workers need
annuitization. To explore the impact of this difference in mortality rates by educational levels,
we follow Kreuger et al. (2015) who calculated mortality rates by education and sex

Notes: In the case of the fixed fraction default approach 10% of retirees’ 401(k) accounts are converted into a LIA
when they turn age 65. In this fixed fraction + threshold default approach, the 10% of assets are converted into
longevity income annuities only when the worker’s 401(k) account equals or exceeds the threshold of $ 65,000.
