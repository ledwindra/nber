The Benefits of College Athletic Success: An Application of the Propensity Score Design
with Instrumental Variables

ABSTRACT
Spending on big-time college athletics is often justified on the grounds that athletic success attracts
students and raises donations. Testing this claim has proven difficult because success is not randomly
assigned. We exploit data on bookmaker spreads to estimate the probability of winning each game
for college football teams. We then condition on these probabilities using a propensity score design
to estimate the effects of winning on donations, applications, and enrollment. The resulting estimates
represent causal effects under the assumption that, conditional on bookmaker spreads, winning is uncorrelated
with potential outcomes. Two complications arise in our design. First, team wins evolve dynamically
throughout the season. Second, winning a game early in the season reveals that a team is better than
anticipated and thus increases expected season wins by more than one-for-one. We address these complications
by combining an instrumental variables-type estimator with the propensity score design. We find that
winning reduces acceptance rates and increases donations, applications, academic reputation, in-state
enrollment, and incoming SAT scores.

Introduction

College athletic spending at National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I
schools exceeded $7.9 billion in 2010 (Fulks 2011). This scale of expenditures is internationally unique and is partly justified on the basis that big-time athletic success, particularly
in football and basketball, attracts students and generates donations. An extensive literature examines these claims but reaches inconsistent conclusions. A series of papers find
positive effects of big-time athletic success on applications and contributions (Brooker and
Klastorin 1981; Sigelman and Bookheimer 1983; Grimes and Chressanthis 1994; Murphy
and Trandel 1994; Tucker 2004; Humphreys and Mondello 2007; Pope and Pope 2009),
but a number of other studies find no impact of big-time athletic success on either measure
(Sigelman and Carter 1979; Baade and Sundberg 1996; Turner et al. 2001; Meer and Rosen
2009; Orszag and Israel 2009). A central issue confronting all studies is the non-random
assignment of athletic success. Schools with skilled administrators may attract donations,
applicants, and coaching talent (selection bias), and surges in donations or applications
may have a direct impact on athletic success (reverse causality). It is thus challenging to
estimate causal effects of athletic success using observational data.
This article estimates the causal effects of college football success using a propensity
score design. Propensity score methods are difficult to apply because researchers seldom
observe all of the important determinants of treatment assignment. Treatment assignment
is thus rarely ignorable given the data at the researcher’s disposal (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983; Dehejia and Wahba 1999). We overcome this challenge by exploiting data on
bookmaker spreads (i.e., the expected score differential between the two teams) to estimate
the probability of winning each game for NCAA “Division I-A” football teams. We then
condition on these probabilities to estimate the effect of football success on donations and
applications. If potential outcomes are independent of winning games after conditioning
on bookmaker expectations, then our estimates represent causal effects.
We face two complications when estimating these effects. First, the treatment – team
wins – evolves dynamically throughout the season, and the propensity score for each win
depends on the outcomes of previous games. We address this issue by independently esti-

2

mating the effect of wins in each week of the season. However, this introduces the second
complication: a win early in the season is associated with a greater than one-for-one increase in total season wins because the winning team has (on average) revealed itself to be
better than expected. We address this issue by combining an instrumental variables-type
estimator with the propensity score estimator.
Applying this framework we find robust evidence that football success increases athletic
donations, increases the number of applicants, lowers a school’s acceptance rate, increases
enrollment of in-state students, increases the average SAT score of incoming classes, and
enhances a school’s academic reputation. The estimates are up to twice as large as comparable estimates from the previous literature. There is less evidence that football success
affects donations outside of athletic programs or enrollment of out-of-state students. The
effects appear concentrated among teams in the six elite conferences classified as “Bowl
Championship Series” (BCS) conferences, with less evidence of effects for teams in other
conferences.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, and Section 3 summarizes the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between football success, donations,
and student body measures. Section 4 discusses the propensity score framework and estimation strategy. Section 5 presents estimates of the causal relationships between football
success, donations, and student body measures. Section 6 concludes.

Data

Approximately 350 schools participate in NCAA Division I sports (the highest division of
intercollegiate athletics). Of these schools, 120 field football teams in the Football Bowl
Subdivision (FBS, formerly known as “Division I-A”). Teams in this subdivision play 10
to 13 games per season and are potentially eligible for post-season bowl games. Games
between teams in this subdivision are high-profile events that are widely televised. We
gathered data on games played by all FBS teams from 1986 to 2009 from the website
Covers.com. Data include information on the game’s date, the opponent, the score of each
team, and the expected score differential between the two teams (known as the spread).
3

We combined these data with data on alumni donations, university academic reputations, applicants, acceptance rates, enrollment figures, and average SAT scores. Donations
data come from the Voluntary Support of Education survey (VSE), acceptance rate and
academic reputation data come from a survey of college administrators and high school
counselors conducted annually by US News and World Report, and application, enrollment,
and SAT data come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).
Reporting dates for these measures range from 1986 to 2008.
The first column of Table 1 presents summary statistics for key variables. Each observation represents a single season for a single team. Actual season wins and expected
season wins are both 5.4 games per season (out of an average of 10.7 games played per
season). We exclude post-season games (bowl games) when calculating wins as participation in these games is endogenously determined by regular season wins. Alumni donations
to athletic programs average $2.4 million per year, and total alumni donations (including
both operating and capital support) average $18.8 million per year. The average school
receives 13,748 applicants every year and accepts 70% of them. A typical incoming class
contains 3,343 students and has a 25th percentile SAT score of 1,054 (IPEDS reports 25th
and 75th percentile SAT scores; using the 75th percentile instead of the 25th percentile
does not affect our conclusions).
The next two sets of columns in Table 1 present summary statistics for BCS and nonBCS conferences respectively. The six BCS conferences are the ACC, Big East, SEC, Big
Ten, Big Twelve, and Pac-10 (now Pac-12). Winners of these conferences are automatically eligible for one of ten slots in the five prestigious BCS bowl games, and through
2012 only three non-BCS conference teams had ever played in a BCS bowl game. Teams
in BCS conferences have more wins (note that inter-conference play is common), more
alumni donations, better academic reputations, lower acceptance rates, and more applicants and enrolled students than teams in non-BCS conferences. Since BCS conference
football teams have higher profiles, we expect that team success may have a larger impact
for these schools (particularly for alumni donations), and we estimate results separately for
BCS conferences.

Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Results

3.1

Cross-sectional Results

We first estimate the cross-sectional relationship between lagged win percentage, alumni
donations, and class characteristics. We estimate linear regressions of the form
yit+1 = β0 + β1 season winsit + β2 season gamesit + φt+1 + εit+1

(1)

where yit+1 represents an outcome for school i in year t + 1 (e.g., alumni donations, applicants, or acceptance rate), season winsit represents school i’s football wins in year t,
season gamesit represents school i’s football games played in year t, and φt+1 represents
a year fixed effect that controls for aggregate time trends. The coefficient of interest is β1 .
We lag the win measure by one year because the college football season runs from September to December, so the full effects of a winning season on donations or applications are
unlikely to materialize until the following year.
The first set of columns in Table 2 reports results from estimating equation (1). One extra win is associated with a $340,400 increase in alumni athletic donations and a $960,100
increase in total alumni donations. Out-of-state and in-state enrollment increase by 34 and
91 students respectively. However, there is no significant relationship between wins and
non-athletic operating donations, the average donation rate, academic reputation, applications, the acceptance rate, or the 25th percentile SAT score.
The large number of hypothesis tests raises the issue of multiple hypothesis testing –
throughout the paper we test for effects on 10 different outcomes using multiple specifications and two subgroups (BCS and non-BCS schools). We address this issue by reporting
“q-values” that control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) across all tables, along with standard per-comparison p-values. The False Discovery Rate is the proportion of rejections
that are false discoveries (type I errors). Controlling FDR at 0.1, for example, implies that
less than 10% of rejections will represent false discoveries. To calculate FDR q-values we
use the “sharpened” FDR control algorithm from Benjamini et al. (2006), implemented in
Anderson (2008). In most cases statistical significance remains even after controlling FDR.

3.2

Longitudinal Results

It is unlikely that the cross-sectional estimates in Table 2 represent causal effects; some
unobserved factors that affect donations or applications are probably correlated with longterm athletic success. To remove unobserved factors that vary across schools but are fixed
over time, we estimate linear regressions of the form
∆yit+1 = β0 + β1 ∆season winsit + β2 ∆season gamesit + φt+1 + εit+1

(2)

where
∆yit+1 = yit+1 − yit−1
∆season winsit = season winsit − season winsit−2
∆season gamesit = season gamesit − season gamesit−2
Other variables are as defined in equation (1), and the coefficient of interest is again β1 .
We difference over two years rather than one year because season winsit may affect yit ,
so estimating a regression using one-year differences may attenuate our estimates of β1 .
Indeed, differencing over one year rather than two years generates estimates that are 46%
smaller in magnitude on average.1
The second set of columns in Table 2 reports results from estimating equation (2). A
one win increase is associated with a $74,000 increase in alumni athletic donations but
no statistically significant increases in total alumni donations or the alumni giving rate.
Academic reputation increases by 0.002 points (0.003 standard deviations). Applications
increase by 104 per year, acceptance rates drop 0.2 percentage points, and in-state enrollment increases by 17 students. There is no significant relationship between increases in
wins and out-of-state enrollment or the 25th percentile SAT score.
Two patterns appear when comparing the cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates.
First, the longitudinal estimates are much more precise, with standard errors that are ap1

The divergence between the two-year differences results and the one-year differences results is largest
for the acceptance rate estimate, which falls by 71%, and smallest for the SAT score estimate, which falls by
4%

6

proximately 3 to 15 times smaller. This is because much of the unexplained variation in
yit occurs across schools rather than within schools, and the differencing transformation in
equation (2) removes most of the cross-school variation in yit . Second, with the exception
of acceptance rates, the longitudinal estimates are all smaller in magnitude than their crosssectional counterparts. In several cases (alumni athletic donations, out-of-state enrollment,
and in-state enrollment) it is possible to reject the hypothesis that the cross-sectional and
longitudinal estimates converge to the same value. The divergence in the two sets of estimates suggests the presence of selection bias or reverse causality, though it could also
indicate persistence in effects (i.e., several winning seasons may have a larger impact than
a single winning season).

3.3

BCS Results

Teams in BCS conferences have higher profiles and thus may experience greater impacts
from football success. Table 3 reports cross-sectional and longitudinal results for BCS
teams. The first set of columns estimates equation (1). There is a significant relationship
between wins and alumni athletic donations, but no other coefficients are significant at
the p = 0.05 level. In most cases the cross-sectional estimates from the BCS sample are
smaller than the cross-sectional estimates from the pooled sample. Estimates from the nonBCS sample are smaller still (see Appendix Table A1). Since conditioning on BCS status
is equivalent to flexibly controlling for BCS status, this pattern suggests that unobserved
differences between BCS and non-BCS schools may affect the pooled cross-sectional estimates.
The second set of columns in Table 3 estimates equation (2). Significant longitudinal
relationships arise between wins and alumni athletic donations, academic reputation, applications, acceptance rates, and in-state and out-of-state enrollment. Longitudinal estimates
from the BCS sample are of the same sign and typically larger magnitude when compared
to longitudinal estimates from the pooled sample. This suggests that effects may be concentrated among BCS schools. Indeed, longitudinal estimates from the non-BCS sample are
generally smaller in magnitude, and all but one are statistically insignificant (see Appendix

7

Table A1).

The Propensity Score Design

4.1

Theoretical Framework

Longitudinal estimates control for unobserved factors that differ across schools but are
constant over time. Nevertheless, they should be interpreted with caution (LaLonde 1986);
changes in donations or admissions could be related to changes in wins through reverse
causality, and trends in other factors (e.g., coaching talent) might be related to both sets of
variables. One way to improve the research design is to condition on observable factors
that determine football wins. However, two problems arise in this context. First, we do not
have data on a wide range of factors that plausibly determine whether a team wins. Second,
even if such data were available, conditioning on a large number of factors introduces
dimensionality problems and makes estimation via matching or subclassification difficult.
In cases with binary treatments, conditioning on the propensity score – the probability of treatment given the observable characteristics – is equivalent to conditioning on the
observables themselves (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983; Dehejia and Wahba 1999). Conditioning on the propensity score, or the probability of a win, is attractive in this case for
two reasons. First, it is readily estimable using bookmaker spreads. Second, it is of low
dimension.
However, the treatment season winsit is not binary but can instead realize integer
values from 0 to 12. Furthermore, it is dynamically determined – each game occurs at
a different point in the season. Recent research has extended propensity score methods
to cases with categorical and continuous treatments (Hirano and Imbens 2004; Imai and
van Dyk 2004). Since the distribution of a bounded random variable is defined by its moments, we could in principle calculate the conditional expectation, variance, and skewness
of season winsit and condition on these quantities. In practice, however, we cannot calculate these conditional moments because bookmaker spreads are updated throughout the
season. Importantly, bookmaker spreads in week s are a function of the team’s performance

8

in weeks 1 through s − 1. Bookmaker spreads are thus endogenously determined by the
treatment itself.
To overcome this problem we separately estimate the effect of winning for each week
of the season. This ensures that the set of conditioning variables is always predetermined
with respect to the treatment. Formally, let the treatment Wist equal one if school i wins in
week s of year t and zero otherwise. The 1 × S row vector wit contains the outcome of
each game for the entire season, with the sth column containing the outcome for week s.
The potential outcome Yit+1 (wi1t , ..., wiSt ) is the value of the outcome for school i in year
t + 1 as a function of wit . Conditional on wins and losses in other weeks, the causal effect
of a win in week s for school i in year t is βist = Yit+1 (wi1t , ..., wis−1t , 1, wis+1t , ..., wiSt ) −
Yit+1 (wi1t , ..., wis−1t , 0, wis+1t , ..., wiSt ). For notational convenience we write Yist (1) =
Yit+1 (wi1t , ..., wis−1t , 1, wis+1t , ..., wiSt ) and Yist (0) = Yit+1 (wi1t , ..., wis−1t , 0, wis+1t , ..., wiSt ).
While there are many potential outcomes for any combination of i, s, and t, we can
only observe Yit+1 (wit ), where wit is the realized series of wins and losses for school i in
year t. If wins were randomly assigned, then Yit+1 (wit ) would be independent of Wist for
all values of wit , and we could estimate E[Yist (1)] and E[Yist (0)] using the sample analogs
of E[Yit+1 |Wist = 1] and E[Yit+1 |Wist = 0]. However, in all likelihood the potential
outcomes Yit+1 (wit ) are correlated with Wist .
To estimate the causal effects of football wins we rely on two assumptions. First, we
make the standard ignorability assumption:
Assumption 1 Strong Ignorability of Treatment Assignment (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983):
Wist ⊥ {Yit+1 (wit ) : wit ∈ W} | Xist . Furthermore, 0 < P (Wist = 1|Xist ) < 1 ∀ Xist ∈
X.
The ignorability assumption is crucial. It implies that, conditional on the observables
Xist , Wist is independent of the potential outcomes Yit+1 (wit ). The ignorability assumption has two unique features in our study. First, Xist represents the set of covariates observed by bookmakers in week s of year t rather than set of covariates available to us the
researchers. Second, there is a strong economic reason to believe that Xist contains all
of the important observables. If there were an observable characteristic x∗ist that predicted
9

Wist and were not included in Xist , then professional bettors could use x∗ist to form superior predictions of P (Wist = 1) than those formed by the bookmakers. This discrepancy
would represent an arbitrage opportunity, and over time bookmakers would go bankrupt
if they did not condition their spreads on x∗ist . Thus, unlike in many data sets, we have a
compelling reason to believe that the ignorability assumption holds. Studies of betting markets support this conjecture in that it has proven difficult to build models that outperform
bookmakers’ spreads by an economically meaningful margin (Glickman and Stern 1998;
Levitt 2004; Stern 2008). Of course, it is theoretically possible that some characteristic
that is unobservable to everyone and affects the probability of winning is correlated with
the potential outcomes. As a robustness check, we reestimate the effects later in the season
when team quality becomes well known, and we find similar results (see Section 5.2).
Proposition 1 Let p(Xist ) = P (Wist = 1 | Xist ). Under strong ignorability, Wist ⊥
{Yit+1 (wit ) : wit ∈ W} | p(Xist ).
Proof : See Appendix A.
Corollary: Under strong ignorability, if Cov(Yit+1 , Wist | p(Xist )) 6= 0, then Wist must
have a causal effect on Yit+1 for some values of i, s, t.
Proof : Suppose that Wist has no casual effect on Yit+1 for any values of i, s, t. Then
Yit+1 (wit ) = Yit+1 for any wit ∈ W. Thus, by Proposition 1, Wist ⊥ Yit+1 | p(Xist ).
Proposition 1 implies that we can test for a causal effect of Wist on Yit+1 by conditioning on p(Xist ) and estimating a regression of Yit+1 on Wist . A significant regression
coefficient in this case allows us to reject the sharp null hypothesis of no effect, and we
use this proposition to estimate p-values in Tables 4–7. These tests are similar in spirit to
propensity score based tests in recent research by Angrist and Kuersteiner on the effects of
monetary policy shocks. However, to estimate the magnitude of the causal effect we make
two additional assumptions.
Assumption 2 Ignorability of Future Treatment Assignments: (Wis+1t , ..., WiSt ) ⊥ {Yit+1 (wit ) :
wit ∈ W} | Xist .

10

Assumption 3 Homogenous Effects Across Weeks: Yit+1 (wit ) = wit βit + Yit+1 (0), where
βit is a S × 1 column vector containing βit in each entry, and 0 is a S × 1 row vector of
zeros.
Assumption 2 extends the standard ignorability assumption to include weeks in year t
following week s. There is minimal cost to making this assumption because it is difficult to
imagine a scenario in which Assumption 1 holds but Assumption 2 does not. For example,
Assumption 2 would be violated if there were some unobserved factor x∗ist that affected
team performance and were correlated with the potential outcome Yit+1 (wit ). In that case,
however, Assumption 1 would likely be violated as well.
Assumption 3 is a simplifying assumption that implies the effect of a win in week s
for team i in year t is always βit . This assumption consists of two components. First,
it imposes a form of the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (Rubin 1980) in that a
team’s performance in week s0 is assumed not to impact the causal effect of performance in
week s. Second, it imposes a homogeneity assumption that wins have equal effects in any
week and that the margin of victory does not matter. We still allow effect heterogeneity by
school and year. While Assumption 3 is not guaranteed to hold, it is no more restrictive
than those imposed when interpreting the linear regression coefficients in Sections 3.1 and
3.2. It is also not needed to test the sharp null hypothesis of no effect – it is only necessary
for estimating the magnitude of the effect.
Assumptions 2 and 3 are useful because they allow us to rescale the observed effect of
winning in week s by the average increase in season wins associated with winning in week
s. This is significant because winning in week s is associated with a higher probability of
winning in later weeks, even after conditioning on p(Xist ). This occurs because a team that
wins reveals itself to be of unexpectedly higher quality. If effects are homogenous across
weeks we can simply rescale the effect of a win in week s by the average increase in season
wins associated that win. For example, if a win in week 3 is associated with an average of
1.5 extra wins during the course of a season (after conditioning on p(Xist )), then we would
rescale the estimated effect of a win in week 3 by 1/1.5 = 0.67.

Proof : See Appendix A.
Proposition 2 suggests a two-step procedure to estimate E[βit | p(Xist )]. First estimate
πp(Xist ) = E[Yit+1 | Wist = 1, p(Xist )] − E[Yit+1 | Wist = 0, p(Xist )], or the change in
P
Yit+1 associated with winning in week s. Then estimate γp(Xist ) = E[ Sj=s+1 Wijt | Wist =
P
1, p(Xist )] − E[ Sj=s+1 Wijt | Wist = 0, p(Xist )] or the change in season wins associated with winning in week s. Finally combine the two estimates to generate βp(Xist ) =
πp(Xist ) /(1 + γp(Xist ) ). In practice this estimator is similar to an instrumental variables
(IV) estimator in which Wist is the instrument (which is exogenous after conditioning on
P
p(Xist )) and Sj=s Wijt is the endogenous treatment to be instrumented.

4.2

Estimation

Estimation proceeds in three steps. First, for each game we estimate the propensity score
p(Xist ) using the published bookmakers’ spread. Next, for each week s we stratify the
sample into 12 bins based on the estimated propensity score (Dehejia and Wahba 1999).2
Within each bin we estimate two linear regressions: a regression of the outcome yit+1
2

We experimented with greater numbers of bins (e.g., 20) and found generally similar results. A larger
number of bins is attractive in that it allows a more flexible relationship between the estimated propensity
score and the outcome. However, the statistical precision of our “first stage” regressions relating total season
wins to winning in week s becomes poor as the number of bins increases (see discussion at the end of this
subsection). Thus we limited the number of bins to 12.

12

on wist and a regression of the expected number of wins for the remainder of the season
PS
(p+
ist =
j=s+1 p(Xijt )) on wist . The first regression estimates πp(Xist ) , and the second regression estimates γp(Xist ) . We include the estimated propensity score as a control in both
regressions to eliminate any remaining imbalance within bins. Finally, we combine the estimates to form βp(Xist ) = πp(Xist ) /(1 + γp(Xist ) ). We compute the average of βp(Xist ) across
all 144 bin-by-week combinations (12 bins per week by 12 weeks per season), weighting
each estimate by the relevant sample size.3
To estimate the propensity score for each observation, we must translate the bookmakers’ “point spread” into the probability of a win. The point spread represents a team’s
expected margin of victory. Previous research has shown that the margin of victory in
National Football League (NFL) games is approximately normal, allowing a simple translation from point spreads to win probabilities (Stern 1991). However, these results may not
apply directly to NCAA football games. To allow flexibility in the relationship, we estimate
a logistic regression of wist on a fifth-order polynomial of the point spread. The results are
highly significant; a likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that all five coefficients equal
zero produces a χ25 statistic of 11,333. We use the fitted values from the logistic regression,
p̂ist , as the propensity score. The minimum and maximum estimated propensity scores are
0.005 and 0.994 respectively.
For each week s we stratify the sample into 12 bins based on p̂ist . Bin 1 contains observations with lowest values of p̂ist , and bin 12 contains observations with the highest values
of p̂ist . We construct the bins so that approximately the same number of observations fall
PS
into each bin. Within each bin b we estimate two regressions. Defining p̂+
ist =
j=s+1 p̂ijt ,
our “first stage” regression is:
p̂+
ist = α0sb + γsb · wist + α1sb · p̂ist + uist

on the estimated propensity score is to weight treated observations by
p An alternative way to condition p
1/p̂ and untreated observations by 1/(1 − p̂). Hirano et al. (2003) show that weighting leads to efficient
estimation of the average treatment effect. However, the weighting estimator does not apply directly to our
context because we need to estimate and combine two separate coefficients, both of which may vary with the
propensity score. If we simply estimate the “reduced form” effect of wist on yit+1 (i.e., we do not adjust for
the fact that winning in week s is associated with more than one additional win over the course of a season),
then we get qualitatively similar results if we stratify on the propensity score as described above or if we
apply the weighting estimator.

13

The regression coefficient γ̂sb estimates the relationship between winning in week s
and winning during the remainder of the season, after conditioning on the propensity score
in week s. We can replace the dependent variable p+
ist with the sum of observed wins,
PS
j=s+1 wijt , without changing the results (though precision is reduced).
Our second regression is equivalent to a “reduced form” regression in an IV setting.
Our reduced form regression is:
yit+1 = δ0sb + πsb · wist + δ1sb · p̂ist + vist

(5)

This regression estimates the relationship between winning in week s and the outcome
yit+1 . Within each bin we then construct β̂sb = π̂sb /(1 + γ̂sb ). After estimating equations
(4) and (5) for each bin b in each week s, we compute

β̂ =

S X
12
X

β̂sb · rsb

(6)

s=1 b=1

where the weights rsb sum to one and are proportional to the number of observations
(games) in bin b in week s.
We make two additional modifications to improve the procedure described above. First,
to ensure that the overlap assumption holds (i.e., 0 < p(Xist ) < 1 ∀ Xist ∈ X ) we trim
the sample for each week s to eliminate all observations with propensity scores less than
the minimum score among winning observations for week s or greater than the maximum
score among losing observations for week s. To be conservative, we further restrict the
sample by dropping any observations with propensity scores less than 0.05 or greater than
0.95, and we eliminate any bins with less than two winning or two losing observations. Our
main conclusions are robust to relaxing these restrictions.4
Our second modification focuses on the “first stage”. Our raw first stage estimates of
γsb are relatively noisy since a typical bin contains less than 150 observations. If γ̂sb is near
4

For example, adding the restriction dropping any observations with propensity scores less than 0.05 or
greater than 0.95 does not change any of the estimated effects by more than 10%, except for the effect on
SAT scores (which changes 13%). All of the restrictions combined do not change the statistical significance
of any of the effects, though they do impact the sizes of some estimates (in particular, the effects on alumni
donations, acceptance rates, and SAT scores change by 21%, 18%, and 30% respectively when all of the
restrictions are added).

−1 in even a small number of cases, the confidence interval for β̂ becomes very wide, since
β̂sb = π̂sb /(1 + γ̂sb ). This problem is well known in the instrumental variables literature
(Bound et al. 1995). To improve the precision of our first stage estimates, we assume that
P
the relationship between wist and Sj=s+1 wijt is reasonably smooth in the propensity score.
For each week s we thus regress γ̂sb on a quadratic in the bin number (b and b2 ) and use the
fitted values from this regression as our estimates of γsb . This improves precision by using
information in bins near bin b to form the estimate of γsb . Alternatively, we could assume
that the first stage coefficient γsb does not vary with the covariates Xist and estimate a first
stage regression that pools observations across all 12 bins for week s. This is standard in
the instrumental variables literature (Angrist and Imbens 1995) and generates qualitatively
similar results.

Propensity Score Results

5.1

Baseline Results

Table 4 reports the results of estimating equation (6) using all FBS (“Division I-A”) schools.
Each row reports the results for a different outcome. In the first set of columns we specify
the outcome in levels (yit+1 ), analogous to equation (1). In the second set of columns we
specify the outcome in two-year differences (∆yit+1 ), analogous to equation (2). Both
sets of estimates should be consistent under Assumptions 1–3, but estimates in the second
column are more precise because differencing removes much of the unexplained crossschool variation in yit+1 . Furthermore, differencing can help eliminate any bias that remains
after conditioning on the propensity score (Smith and Todd 2005). In this section we focus
on the differenced results (the second set of columns) because precision is limited in the
first set of columns.
Estimates from the propensity score design imply that an extra win increases alumni
athletic donations by $136,400. There are no statistically significant effects on non-athletic
donations, total donations, or the alumni giving rate, though we lack sufficient precision
to rule out economically significant effects. An extra win increases a school’s academic

15

reputation by 0.004 points (0.006 standard deviations) and increases the number of applicants by 135 (1%). Acceptance rates decrease by 0.3 percentage points (0.4%), in-state
enrollment increases by 15 students (0.6%), and the 25th percentile SAT score increases
1.8 points (0.02 standard deviations). All of these results remain significant when controlling FDR at the q = 0.10 level, and all but the effects on academic reputation and acceptance
rate remain significant when controlling FDR at the q = 0.05 level.
A natural question is how the propensity score results compare to the longitudinal results from Section 3.2. In general, the propensity score design produces larger estimates
than the differenced regression. For example, the estimated effect on athletic donations is
84% larger, on academic reputation is 71% larger, on applicants is 31% larger, on acceptance rate is 45% larger, and on SAT scores is 205% larger. The only statistically significant
effect that is smaller with the propensity score design than the differenced regression is instate enrollment (which is 8% smaller). This pattern implies that changes in expected wins
are associated with smaller outcome gains than changes in unexpected wins. On the one
hand, this may occur because changes in expected wins are correlated with confounding
factors that attenuate the true effects. On the other hand, it is possible that alumni and applicants react more strongly to unexpected wins than to expected wins. Previous research
has found that negative reactions are more pronounced following unexpected NFL losses
than following expected NFL losses (Card and Dahl 2011).
Table 5 reports propensity score results estimated separately for BCS and non-BCS
teams. In all regressions the dependent variable is specified in two-year differences (∆yit+1 ).
For most outcomes the estimated effect for BCS teams (the first column) is larger (or more
positive) than the estimated effect for non-BCS teams (the second column). However, for
in-state enrollment and SAT scores, there is a larger effect among non-BCS schools than
among BCS schools. Both these measures pertain to attracting students rather than satisfying alumni, and it is possible that winning seasons have a larger effect on visibility for
lower-profile non-BCS schools than for high-profile BCS schools.

16

5.2

Effects Excluding Early Season Games

The propensity score design is particularly credible for games occurring later in the season.
At that point bookmakers have better knowledge of each team’s skill, and wins and losses
are closer to truly random after conditioning on bookmaker odds. As a robustness check
we estimate the results while excluding the first month of the season. The second set of
columns in Table 6 reports these results (the first set of columns reports the baseline results
from Table 4 for comparison).
In most cases the estimates change little when we exclude the first four games of the
season. Statistically significant effects remain for alumni athletic donations, academic reputation, applicants, in-state enrollment, and SAT scores (the one exception is the acceptance
rate, which becomes statistically insignificant). Precision falls since there are now fewer
games used in the estimation sample, and many effects are only marginally significant after controlling FDR. Nevertheless, the similarity in the point estimates between the two
columns for outcomes that are statistically significant in the baseline results is reassuring.

5.3

Persistent Effects

The baseline results demonstrate that wins in year t affect outcomes in year t + 1. If wins
have persistent effects, then wins in year t may also affect outcomes in year t+2 or beyond.
P
Let wit be wins in year t (i.e., wit = Ss=1 wist ). It is tempting to estimate the effect of wit
on yit+2 by simply replacing yit+1 with yit+2 in the “reduced form” equation, equation (5).
However, doing so overlooks the fact that winning in year t is correlated with winning in
year t + 1, even after conditioning on the propensity score. This occurs for the same reason
that winning in week s is correlated with winning in week s + 1 even after conditioning on
the propensity score – a win in week s can reveal that a team has more talent than expected.
Some of the estimated effect of winning in year t on yit+2 may thus result from increased
wins in year t + 1.
We use the following procedure to estimate the effect of wit on yit+2 while holding
wit+1 constant. First, we replace yit+1 with yit+2 in equation (5) and estimate equation (6).
Denote this estimate as ψ̂; ψ̂ estimates the “reduced form” effect of wit on yit+2 without

17

controlling for changes in wit+1 . Next, we estimate the relationship between wit and wit+1 .
To do this we replace yit+1 with wit+1 in the “reduced form” equation (5) and estimate
equation (6). Denote this estimate as λ̂; λ̂ estimates the relationship between wit and wit+1
(after conditioning on the propensity score). Finally, we calculate θ̂ = ψ̂ − λ̂β̂, where β̂ is
the causal effect of wit on yit+1 (estimated in Section 5.1). In short, we adjust the reduced
form effect of wit on yit+2 to account for the fact that wit+1 is increasing in wit (i.e., λ̂) and
that wit+1 affects yit+2 (i.e., β̂).
The second set of columns in Table 7 reports estimates of θ̂, the effect of winning in
year t on outcomes in year t + 2. There is little evidence that winning has effects that
persist for two years. Most of the estimates are statistically insignificant and smaller than
comparable estimates from Table 4 (reproduced in the first set of columns). None are
statistically significant after controlling FDR. The effects of winning in year t appear to be
concentrated in the following year.

Conclusions

For FBS schools, winning football games increases alumni athletic donations, enhances a
school’s academic reputation, increases the number of applicants and in-state students, reduces acceptance rates, and raises average incoming SAT scores. The estimates imply that
large increases in team performance can have economically significant effects, particularly
in the area of athletic donations. Consider a school that improves its season wins by 5 games
(the approximate difference between a 25th percentile season and a 75th percentile season).
Changes of this magnitude occur approximately 8% of the time over a one-year period and
13% of the time over a two-year period. This school may expect alumni athletic donations
to increase by $682,000 (28%), applications to increase by 677 (5%), the acceptance rate
to drop by 1.5 percentage points (2%), in-state enrollment to increase by 76 students (3%),
and incoming 25th percentile SAT scores to increase by 9 points (1%). These estimates
are equal to or larger than comparable estimates from the existing literature. For example,
among studies that found significant effects, a 5-win increase in team performance was
associated with a 2.1% to 2.5% increase in applications (Murphy and Trandel 1994; Pope
18

and Pope 2009) and a $687,000 increase in restricted donations (Humphreys and Mondello
2007).
Do these effects imply that investing in team quality generates positive net benefits for
an FBS school? Answering this question is difficult because we do not know the causal
relationship between team investments and team wins. Nevertheless, we consider a simple
back-of-the-envelope calculation to establish the potential return on team investments.
Orszag and Israel (2009) report that a $1 million increase in “football team expenditures” is associated with a 6.7 percentage point increase in football winning percentage
(0.8 games). If we interpret this relationship as causal, it implies that a $1 million investment in football team expenditures increases alumni athletic donations by $109,000,
increases annual applications by 108, and increases the average incoming SAT score by 1.4
points. These effects seem too modest by themselves to offset the additional expenditures.
However, if increases in team expenditures generate commensurate increases in athletic
revenue (another finding in Orszag and Israel (2009), though a portion of this relationship
is presumably due to reverse causality), then the effects estimated here represent a “bonus”
that the school gets on top of the increased athletic revenue.
Two additional caveats apply when interpreting our results. First, we estimate the effects of unexpected wins. If a school invests in its football program and improves its record,
alumni and applicant expectations will eventually change. The effects of a persistent increase in season wins may therefore differ from the effects we estimate here.
Second, the effects we observe likely operate through two channels. One channel is
team quality – a team that plays well is more enjoyable to watch than a team that plays
poorly, even holding constant the game’s outcome. This is in part why the NFL can charge
much higher ticket prices than competing leagues that employ less skilled players (e.g.,
the Arena Football League). The second channel is winning itself – fans and alumni enjoy
winning games regardless of how well the team plays. Team records, however, are by definition a zero-sum game; one team’s win is another team’s loss. The effects demonstrated
here thus do not change the “arms race” nature of team investment, as each team purchases
its wins at the cost of other teams. While improving the overall level of play in the NCAA
may attract more fans and alumni support through the first channel, it cannot have any ef19

fect on the second channel. A simultaneous investment of $1 million in each BCS football
team will likely generate smaller effects on donations and applications than the estimates
presented in this paper.
These caveats notwithstanding, we demonstrate that big-time athletic success can attract donations and students. We do so by extending the propensity score design to a dynamic setting in which multiple treatments occur at different points in time. In this setting
the propensity score for any given treatment depends on the realized values of previous
treatments. We apply this framework in a context in which the ignorability assumption
is likely to hold and in which previous research has generated inconsistent conclusions.
While the ignorability assumption does not apply in many circumstances, in those that it
does these tools may facilitate estimation of causal effects.

Notes: Donation measures are in thousands of dollars. Parentheses contain standard errors clustered at the school level. FDR qvalues control the False Discovery Rate across all tables. Each coefficient is from a separate regression in which the dependent
variable is regressed on season wins. All regressions include season games and year fixed effects as controls, and all variables in
longitudinal regressions are differenced over two years (see Section 3.2). The sample is restricted to BCS schools.

Notes: Donation measures are in thousands of dollars. Parentheses contain standard errors clustered at the school level, and pvalues test the sharp null hypothesis of no effect. FDR q-values control the False Discovery Rate across all tables. Each coefficient
represents the effect of an additional football win on the outcome, computed from equation (6) as described in Section 4.2.
