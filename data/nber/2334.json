This paper uses data on a sample of sisters to explore the importance of family background as a determinant of welfare program participation. The results show a strikingly high degree of sibling resemblance in welfare receipt. For example, a woman's estimated probability of having participated in welfare programs is .20 if her sister has not participated, but is -.66 if her sister has participated.\n\n",
