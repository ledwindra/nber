The problem of sequencing of stabilization and structural reforms is analyzed with detail.  First from a theoretical perspective, second, reviewing the stabilization programs implemented in Latin America on a case by case basis.  Particular emphasis is given to the analysis of the fiscal consequences of the chosen sequencing, as well as its impact on the evolution of domestic savings and investment, and on foreign investment. The final part of the paper concentrates on the behavior of real exchange rates during the stabilization programs and its relationship with trade reforms.\n\n",
