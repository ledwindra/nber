    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper analyzes the evolution of the U.S. trade relations with Latin America, investigating the possible path that these relations will take in the future. The data analyzed show that during the last 15 years or so there has been no significant loss in the U.S. aggregate competitive position in Latin America. However, there has been a significant change in the composition of U.S. exports to the Latin American nations. The paper also deals with issues related to direct foreign investment in Latin America, comparing the importance of the U.S. and other nations. Finally, the role of international trade in the solution of the current Latin American debt crisis, and in the reassumption of sustained growth in the region is discussed.\n\n",
