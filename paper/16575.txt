The Regional Distribution of Skill Premia in Urban China

NBER Working Paper No. 16575
December 2010
JEL No. J00,J01,J30,J31
ABSTRACT
We document and discuss the implications of a sharp increase in the regional dispersion of skill premia
in China in recent years. This has previously been little noted or discussed. We use three urban household
surveys for 1995, 2002, and 2007 and estimate skill premia at provincial and city levels. Results show
an increase in the skill premium across all regions between 1995 and 2002, but only coastal regions
show significant increases in skill premia between 2002 and 2007. For 2007, coastal regions also have
much higher within region wage inequality and this contributes more to overall urban wage inequality
than within region inequality of non-coastal regions. Using a fixed effects model at city level, we find
that ownership restructuring is a significant factor in driving up skill premia during the first period,
and that the ongoing process of China’s integration into the global economy plays a significant and
regionally concentrated role in the second period.

1. Introduction
The behavior of the skill premium (the wage differential between skilled and
unskilled labor) is central to an understanding of the evolution of inequality in urban
China. There has been a large amount of research trying to estimate the skill premium
over time, usually measured as the return to education (see Zhang et al. 2005; Li and
Ding 2003).1 How the skill premia has evolved within regions and how this may have
affected overall inequality is, however, largely neglected in literature.
Here, we use three Chinese urban household surveys for 1995, 2002, and 2007 to
estimate skill premia at a provincial and city level for each year. We find substantial
yearly dispersion across regions but also find an increase in skill premia across all
regions between 1995 and 2002, while only coastal regions witness significant
increases in skill premia between 2002 and 2007.
We then use the cross regional variation in skill premia within each year to
explore which factors account for the increase in skill premia. We construct a panel
data set at city level and use a fixed effects model. We find a significant relationship
between export activity and increases in skill premia. This is stronger in the period
between 2002 and 2007, suggesting that China’s entry into WTO and wider
integration into the global economy after 2001 may have played a significant role. In
the period between 1995 and 2002, institutional change (i.e. ownership restructuring)
seemingly plays key role in driving up the skill premium in the various regions. While
1

There are also many estimates of the return to education across other divides. Dong and Bowles (2002), for
instance, estimate the return to education by ownership.
2

there has been research that explores the relationship between inequality and China’s
globalization process (Wan et al. 2007, Zhang and Zhang 2002, Wei and Wu, 2003,
Cai et al. 2010), little of this studies the impacts of structural changes brought on by
China’s entry into WTO.
We also suggest that investigating how the regional distribution of skill premia
changes can also help in providing a more complete understanding of changes in
urban wage inequality. If wage inequality is decomposed into between-region
inequality and within-region inequality, the within-region inequality can in turn be
expressed by a weighted average of the inequality for all regions. The various regions
in China show different inequality and hence different contributions to overall
(residual) wage inequality. We find that, by 2007, coastal regions have much higher
within region inequality (because of higher skill premia) and this contributes more to
overall urban wage inequality, a feature that seemingly has not yet been documented
in the literature.
This paper is organized as follows. We discuss literature on skill premia in
section 2. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 reports estimates of skill premia,
their regional distribution and evolution overtime. Section 5 investigates the factors
underlying patterns of regional skill premia over time and also discusses the
implications for overall urban wage inequality. Section 6 concludes.

2. Why Is The Regional Distribution of Skill Premium Important in China?
China is a large developing country in economic transition and its various
regions have very different levels of economic development (Schott 2006). Earlier
research has concluded that regional disparity is a major contributor to overall
inequality (see Gustafsson et al. 2008). The literature has, however, neglected the
feature that the relative wages of skilled and unskilled labor may be different across
regions.
Given the large amount of effort devoted in previous literature to trying to
estimate skill premia, the extension to include the regional dimension is a natural
further step. It seems well established that wage determination mechanisms were
significantly different between different ownership types of firms in the 1990s, with
private sector firms sharing a higher skill premium (Meng 2000, Dong and Bowles
2002, Xing 2008, Zhang et al. 2005). Meanwhile, different regions had a different
firm ownership mix. In 2008 for example, the registered employment share in SOEs is
around 30% for most coastal provinces (Zhejiang (27%) and Fujian (32%) for
instance). For some other provinces such as Jiangxi, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu,
Qinghai, the shares are still above 70% (NBS, 2009) 2. The above implies that
different regions have different skill premia.
Another reason for regional unevenness is differential exposure to trade activity.
The policy of opening up was first implemented in the east and led to rapid growth of
2

These shares are calculated using the number of staff and workers in state owned units divided by the total
number of registered employments. All numbers are for urban areas (NBS, 2009: table 4-8). Taking into account
those not registered, the SOE shares may overestimate the real shares.

exports and FDI inflows. In 1995, the average share of exports in GDP in coastal
provinces was 32%, while that for non-coastal provinces was below 7%.3 China
experienced a sharp increase in trade activity in a relatively short period of time after
its entry into WTO (Wan et al. 2007, Branstetter and Lardy 2006), and most of the
increase was in coastal regions. By 2007, the average export share in GDP in coastal
provinces had reached 45%, while that for non-coastal provinces was still below 8%.
Along with rapid export growth, China’s exports were becoming more sophisticated
with resources moving from agriculture and textiles into machinery, electronics, and
assembly (Schott 2006, Amiti and Freund 2008, Wang and Wei 2008). This upgrading
of the export sector increased the demand for and relative wages of more skilled labor
in coastal regions.
The above regional patterns reflect in part the policies of the Chinese
government. In the earlier reform period, the central government offered not only
preferential policies to but also more investment to coastal regions to encourage
exports and attract FDI. The five Special Economic Zones (SEZs)4, for example, are
all in coastal regions (Wang and Wei 2008). In the late 1990s however, because of the
widening regional gap, preferential policies were more often given to the central and
western regions. Many policies were also location specific, such as policies to
developing the Pudong New District in Shanghai, the Binhai New District in Tianjin,

Coastal provinces include Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Hainan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shangdong, Shanghai,
Tianjin, and Zhejiang. Non-coastal provinces include Anhui, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Heilongjiang,
Hubei, Hunan, Jilin, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Tibet, Xinjiang,
Yunnan, and Chongqing. Export shares are first calculated for each province, and then averaged for coastal and
non-coastal regions. The shares for 2007 are calculated the same way.

Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan.

and the more recent strategy to revitalize the Old Industry Base of the Northeast.
These often involve preferential policies by the central government and more
investment in infrastructure.
Finally but by no means the least, several features of China’s labor market have
made this process less effective, although labor migration still tends to equalize
relative wage gaps among regions. In particular, the Hukou system is still a major
barrier to regional mobility of labor. Many locally provided public services such as
health care and schooling are still not available to residents without local urban
Hukou. This significantly raises migration costs (see Cai et al. 2009, Xing 2010 for a
more detailed description of China’s institutional arrangement of Hukou system). The
high price of housing is another factor preventing people moving from low skill
premium locations to high skill premium locations.
All of the above are also often cited as reasons for growing regional disparity in
income levels, instead of changes in the relative wages of skilled and unskilled labor.
Existing literature has largely neglected the possibility that these regional imbalances
(in trade policies for example) may have different impacts on individuals with
different skills. In the same spirit, mobility restrictions such as Hukou also have
different effects on skilled and unskilled labor. As skilled workers demand more
permanent positions, they are more sensitive to the availability of housing, social
security coverage, and other public services.
The neglect of regional dispersion of skill premia in previous literature is partly
6

due to limitations of data. Most existing research emphasizes regional disparities
based on aggregate data, which makes the discussion of skill premium difficult. Also,
while there is usually a clear relationship between economic development and average
regional income (the regional income level is often used as proxy for its economic
development level), the relationship between relative wages and economic
development is not unambiguous.

7

3. Data and Summary Statistics
Here, we use data from three China Household Income Project (CHIP) surveys
for 1995, 2002, and 2007 to estimate the regional dispersion of skill premia over time.
The CHIP data is known for its high quality and national representativeness. In 1995,
2002, and 2007, the urban survey covered 11, 12, and 16 provinces, autonomous
regions, or municipalities, which also included a wide variety of regions in terms of
geography and economic development. Although this is not formally constructed as a
panel data set, the provinces and the cities covered by these surveys do not change
much, allowing comparisons between different years. In 1995 and 2002, the survey
collected information from Beijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei,
Guangdong, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Guansu. The only difference after
1997 is that Chongqing is separated from Sichuan Province as a municipality. More
provinces are included in the 2007 survey (the new municipalities or provinces are
Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan) while those in the previous surveys are
retained. We can thus construct a panel data at city level (though unbalanced), which
allows us to control for time-invariant unobservables.
In using the CHIP data, we retain information on all males aged 22 to 60, and on
females aged 22 to 55. We keep only those over 22 because according to China’s
education system, people typically finish college education at age 22. The age
thresholds of 60 and 55 for males and females reflect current arrangements for
retirement age. We use labor incomes of urban workers. There are two parts to labor
8

income: regular wages and subsidies and other labor income. All income data are
deflated to 1995 RMB prices using the national CPI.
Table 1 provides summary statistics, which give a sense of the evolution of
China’s labor market from 1995 to 2007. Both the average ages and education levels
increased continuously over these years. In 1995, the average age of the urban
working population was 39.5 years old. It increased to 41.5 in 2002 and then further
to 42.3 in 2007. In terms of education, the average years of schooling increased from
10.8 in 1995 to 11.3 in 2002 and to 12.8 in 2007. Looking at different education levels,
a more detailed pattern of education expansion emerges. The share of the population
with tertiary education increased significantly between 2002 and 2007. Columns 1 to
3 in Table 2 report the share of skilled workers by province. Skilled labor includes
those with college degrees (3 or 4 years) or above and those with technical school
degrees. Those with high school degrees or below are classified as unskilled workers.
As a whole, the fraction of skilled workers increased from 40.7% in 1995 to 43.6% in
2002 and to 53% in 2007, with significant differences among regions.
The change in the shares of labor force for different firm ownership largely
reflects the restructuring process in urban China. In the mid 1990s, nearly all the
workforce was employed in the public sector of various forms. By 2007, however,
that share had decreased sharply to 62%. On the other hand, workers in the private
sector increased significantly from negligible (2%) in 1995 to nearly 40% in 2007.
Table 2 reports income levels, inequality measures, and the skilled worker shares
9

for different provinces for different years. There were significant increases in income
between 1995 and 2002 and between 2002 and 2007. Annual average wages increased
from 6100 Yuan in 1995 to 9530 Yuan in 2002 and further to 18253 Yuan in 2007,
nearly tripling in 12 years. Data also indicate that both income levels and income
growth were unbalanced across provinces, with coastal regions having much higher
income levels and growth rates.
In terms of Gini coefficients (column 4-6), there was a significant increase in
inequality for every province between 1995 and 2002. On the whole, the Gini
coefficient increased significantly from 0.296 to 0.372. For the period 2002-2007,
increases in Gini coefficients were not as large as those in the first period, with the
whole sample Gini increasing from 0.372 in 2002 to 0.407 in 2007. But the change
was different for different regions. For hinterland provinces, the Gini coefficients
even declined (Shanxi and Henan for example), while for coastal provinces, Gini
coefficients kept rising (Jiangsu for example). We also provide generalized entropy
measures of inequality with sensitivity parameter 2 (hereafter GE(2)), which can be
decomposed by region. They show similar patterns to the Gini coefficients. The shares
of the skilled worker increased for most provinces, and there were more increases
between 2002 and 2007 than between 1995 and 2002. The pace of increase was
different for different province.

4. The Regional Distribution of Skill Premia (Returns to Education)
4.1 Wage Levels of Skilled and Unskilled Workers and Skill Premium
Average wage levels for skilled and unskilled labor and for all workers by
province are reported in Figure 1. To show regional differentials, we use the export
share in GDP as the source of regional variation in the horizontal axis. Trade activity
varies a lot across regions, and is highly correlated with regional economic
development levels. Changes in trading volume are also a major potential explanatory
variable for the changing regional distribution of skill premia.
We concentrate on the income gap between skilled and unskilled labor (a crude
measure of skill premium), and how these gaps differ among different provinces and
how the pattern evolves over time (see Figure 1). In the mid 1990s, the income gaps
were moderate, with the skilled earning higher than the unskilled across different
provinces. In 2002, the income gap for almost all provinces increased significantly,
with some indications that the skilled-unskilled gap in coastal provinces was larger. In
2007, the skilled-unskilled gap in coastal provinces was still growing while in
non-coastal regions, no such trend appeared. Thus skilled workers in coastal regions
have higher wages relative to unskilled workers than their non-coastal counterparts.
Regional disparity for unskilled workers also exists. This disparity is not as noticeable
as for skilled workers and for unskilled workers in previous years.
Results in Figure 1 indicate that there was a significant increase in the skill
premium for all provinces in the late 1990s, but the changes in skill premia for
11

different provinces show different patterns for the period 2002 to 2007. Coastal
regions face an increase in the skill premium, while in non-coastal regions the skill
premium did not increase.
These results do not control for some key factors. First, the skilled-unskilled
classification does not take into account a number of individual characteristics. For
example, experience may be related to accumulation of human capital (both general
and specific), and if coastal and non-coastal provinces have a different age (and
therefore experience) structure, the gap between skilled and unskilled may be partly
due to the different age structure of different regions. The skill premium may be
influenced by ownership structure, industry composition, and other factors. In
particular, if rent accrues to ownership or industry affiliation, the skilled-unskilled gap
may be heavily a reflection of different regions having different ownership or
industrial structures.
Non-work rates may also be different in different regions. When samples with
wage incomes are not selected from the working age population at random, the skill
premiums using the observed data are potentially subject to selection bias. These
concerns can be addressed by using Heckman’s two-step selection model (Heckman,
1979).
For the first two problems, we control for experience, gender, ownership, and
industry in the regressions of wage equations, and focus on the coefficients for the
skilled-unskilled dummy. To correct for selection bias, we include an inverse Mills
12

ratio in regressions.
We thus use regression equations as follows:
ln (WAGE ) = β 0 + β1 * SKILLED + β 2 * EXPER + β 3 * EXPERSQ + γX + ρσλ + ε

(1)

where SKILLED is a dummy variable indicating that an individual has tertiary
education degree (3 or 4 year college or above) or technical school degree. Vector X
includes a gender dummy, ownership dummies, and industry dummies. λ is the
inversed Mills ratio. ρ is the correlation coefficient between the error terms of the
selection model and the wage determination model. σ is the standard deviation of the
error term for the wage determination model. In the implicit selection model which is
not written down explicitly, the regressors include all those in the wage determination
model. We also include the employment rate (one minus non-work rate) as an
instrumental variable. A Heckman two step procedure is then used for each province
separately to estimate regional skill premia.
Table 3a reports our results. For the earlier period between 1995 and 2002, the
skill premium increases sharply across all regions. This is consistent with existing
literature that documents an overall increasing trend in rising returns to education (Liu
et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2005). Less well documented is the large variation across
regions in the skill premium. In 1995, the skill premium in Guangdong is the highest
(0.366), while that in Jiangsu is the lowest (0.070). The second lowest is Beijing
(0.108). In 2002, Henan became the province with the lowest skill premium (0.240),
Gansu became the one with highest skill premium (0.470), followed by Liaoning
13

(0.417), Sichuan (0.410), Chongqing (0.405), and Guangdong (0.368). Gansu and
Sichuan are western provinces, and for these there seems no clear relationship
between skill premia and economic development. The estimation of skill premia by
region is thus important for describing the evolution of inequality between 2002 and
2007. For central and western provinces, there are clear signs that the skill premium
stopped rising or even declined (Shanxi, Chongqing, and Sichuan for example). For
coastal regions skill premia kept rising. This pattern in results is consistent with both
deepening globalization and educational expansion.
4.2 Return to Years of Schooling and Returns to Different Education Levels
Dividing the labor force only into skilled and unskilled categories is a crude
simplification. Along with educational expansion in the late 1990s, there is significant
composition change within skilled worker groups. Estimated skill premium may thus
be contaminated by composition change. We therefore estimate returns to years of
schooling and returns to various levels of educations using two different models:
ln (WAGE ) = β0 + β1 * SCHOOLING + β 2 * EXPER + β3 * EXPERSQ + γX + ρσλ + ε

(2)

ln (WAGE ) = β 0 + ∑ γ i * EDU i + β 2 * EXPER + β3 * EXPERSQ + γX + ρσλ + ε

(3)

i

In (2) SCHOOLING is years of formal schooling, and in (3) EDUi are dummies for
various education levels5. Results for these models are reported in the remaining
columns of Table 3, and largely speaking, the patterns of these results are consistent
with our results above. For the returns to years of schooling, the most important
5

For space reasons, only college premia (or returns to college) are reported.
14

feature is the large regional variation in 2007. One year of schooling is associated
with a 10-14% increase in wages in coastal regions, while in other provinces returns
are well below 10%.
Estimation of skill premia by education level also shows some other important
details in the evolution of returns. First, most of the increases in returns to education
are concentrated in higher levels of education, especially college education. Second,
coastal regions witnessed rising returns for almost every tertiary education level.
Returns to education also decreased significantly for high school graduates. Finally,
we estimate skill premia at a city level. The distributions of skill premia are reported
in Figure 2. The patterns are similar to what is observed at provincial level. A
prominent feature of Figure 2 is the larger dispersion in 2007. In particular, the upper
half of the skill premium distribution has much larger densities than in previous years,
a phenomenon already emphasized.

15

5. Explanation of Results and Their Implications
5.1 Factors That Influence the Evolution of the Regional Skill Premium
To assess the importance of various factors behind the evolution of regional skill
premia, we estimate the following fixed effects model:
SKILLPREM it = β 0 + β1 * EXPGDPit + β 2 * SOEit + β3 * SKILLEDit +γXit + ui + ε it

(4)

In this model, SKILLPREM is the estimated skill premium or return to years of
schooling, and subscript i refers to different cities. We also estimate inequality
measures and skill premia at city level to more fully explore regional differentials.
Because the sample size for individuals is smaller at city level than provincial level,
we only estimate skill premia and return to years of schooling instead of the return to
different levels of education. Once we obtain these measures, we use them as
dependent variables in the fixed effects regressions.
EXPGDP is the ratio of export to GDP. We use the ratio EXPGDPit to measure
the openness of a particular region i at a particular time t. ui is a time invariant
unobservable individual regional characteristic. SOEit is the share of the labor force in
state owned enterprises. SKILLEDit is the share of skilled labor in the labor force.
Using a fixed effects model, we can control for regional unobserved characteristics.
We use only two periods of time in each regression, and in this case a fixed effects
model is equivalent to using a first differences method.
Results are reported in Table 4. For the period 1995 to 2002, the openness
16

variable (Export/GDP) has a positive but insignificant effect on skill premia, and the
effect on the return to education is significant at a 10% level but negative. The
coefficients are 0.091 and -0.047 respectively. For the period 2002 to 2007, the
coefficients on openness variable become positive and significant at a 1% level. A
10% increase in export share was associated with an 11% increase in the skill
premium and a 2% increase in the return to schooling. The changes in the coefficients
on export variable indicate a structural change following China’s entry into WTO.
Equally interesting are the coefficients for SOE. Between 1995 and 2002, the
coefficients of SOE are both significantly negative, which means that the relative
reduction in the size of the SOE sector played a major role in the increase in skill
premium. This is only true for the first period. Between 2002 and 2007, none of the
SOE coefficients are significant. These results are consistent with the timing of
China’s ownership restructuring process, and they support the earlier results due to
Zhang et al (2005) and Liu et al, (2010), while also indicating that their conclusions
need revision.

5.2 Skill premia and Inequality
One implication of the evolution of regional skill premium distributions is for
regional inequality. In Figure 3, we plot the relationship between skill premia and
wage inequality at a provincial level. In 1995, both skill premia and wage inequality
at provincial level were low. Between 1995 and 2002, there is an increase in skill
premia for all regions. As a consequence, inequality within regions increased
17

dramatically. Between 2002 and 2007, the dispersion of skill premium across regions
also grew as did inequality across different regions. In 2007, the relationship between
skill premia and inequality became more positive and significant. In Table 5, we
regress both regional Gini coefficients and GE(2) on skill premia in different years. In
all these regressions, the coefficients on skill premia are positive. But in year 1995
and 2002, they are relatively small and insignificant. In 2007, however, the
coefficients are higher and significant at a 1% significance level.
To assess the implications of the evolution of regional skill premium, we can
decompose the overall wage inequality (GE(2), which is regionally decomposable)
into between- and within-province inequality (see Table 6). One prominent feature of
urban wage inequality is that within regional inequality plays a progressively
important role. In 1995, the overall and within inequalities measured as GE(2) are
0.18 and 0.14. During the period between 1995 and 2002, almost all of the increase in
overall wage inequality (from 0.18 to 0.28) comes from within region inequality
change (from 0.14 to 0.24) and between region inequality even decreased slightly.
Again, most of the inequality change between 2002 and 2007 (from 0.27 to 0.36)
comes from within region inequality (0.24 to 0.31).
The decomposition exercises in panel A of Table 6 miss the important feature
that coastal regions have much higher within region inequality than non-coastal
regions. Therefore in panels B and C we perform the same exercises for non-coastal
and coastal regions separately. Results suggest that coastal regions have much higher
within region inequality. Between 2002 and 2007 for example, while the within region
18

inequality in non-coastal regions increased by 0.03 from 0.19 to 0.22, that in coastal
regions increased by 0.07 from 0.26 to 0.33. In summary, the decomposition exercise
suggests a major role for within regional inequality in overall inequality, and that
within region inequality in coastal regions played an even larger role than for
non-coastal regions.

19

6. Conclusions
This paper uses three Chinese household surveys for 1995, 2002, and 2007, to
estimate both the levels and changes in skill premia for different provinces. We use
them to estimate regional dispersion in skill premia. Although there is an increase in
skill premia in nearly all provinces between 1995 and 2002, we do not find such
increase between 2002 and 2007. Data from the 2007 survey indicate a strong positive
relationship between openness and skill premia, with coastal regions having much
higher skill premia than those in non-coastal regions. We interpret the results between
2002 and 2007 as the result of China’s deepening globalization after entry into the
WTO.
