The Black-White Test Score Gap Through Third Grade

NBER Working Paper No. 11049
January 2005
JEL No. I2
ABSTRACT
This paper describes basic facts regarding the black-white test score gap over the first four years of
school. Black children enter school substantially behind their white counterparts in reading and math,
but including a small number of covariates erases the gap. Over the first four years of school,
however, blacks lose substantial ground relative to other races; averaging .10 standard deviations per
school year. By the end of third grade there is a large Black-White test score gap that cannot be
explained by observable characteristics. Blacks are falling behind in virtually all categories of skills
tested, except the most basic. None of the explanations we examine, including systematic differences
in school quality across races, convincingly explain the divergent academic trajectory of Black
students.

Decades after the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education,
racial gaps in educational achievement remain substantial. Prior research shows black children
enter kindergarten lagging their white counterparts, and these differences grow throughout the
school years (Campbell, Hombo, and Mazzeo 2000, Carneiro and Heckman 2002, Coleman et. al
1966, Neal 2004, Phillips, Crouse, and Ralph 1998). On every subject at each grade level there
are substantial differences between Blacks and Whites (Campbell, Hombo, and Mazzeo 2000,
Neal 2004). The typical Black seventeen year-old reads at the proficiency level of the typical
White thirteen year-old (Campbell, Hombo, and Mazzeo 2000). Black college bound students
score, on average, more than one standard deviation below white college goers; Blacks are the
lowest performing minority group (Roach 2001). Even in affluent neighborhoods, achievement
gaps are large (Ferguson 2001, 2002 and Ogbu 2003). Including a myriad controls, the test score
gap remains essentially unchanged (Jencks and Phillips 1998). While the Brown decision
provided unprecedented hope for a future of educational equality, that hope has yet to be
realized.
Despite these disturbing differences, a recent analysis of a newly available data set, the
Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), provides two reasons for optimism (Fryer and
Levitt 2004). First, the raw test score differences for the recent cohort covered by ECLS are
substantially below those found in earlier studies, suggesting the possibility of real gains by
Blacks in recent cohorts. Second, in stark contrast to previous studies, Fryer and Levitt (2004)
are able to eliminate the black-white test score gap for incoming kindergartners with the
inclusion of just a parsimonious set of controls. Any optimism, however, is tempered by the fact
that by the end of first grade (the last data used in Fryer and Levitt 2004) Black students have
2

already lost substantial ground (the equivalent of almost three months of schooling) relative to
Whites. If this trend were to continue, by the tenth grade blacks would be one standard deviation
behind whites – a number consistent with prior research (Jones, Burton, and Davenport 1982,
Phillips et al. 1998b; Phillips 2000).
Fryer and Levitt (2004) were largely unsuccessful in pinpointing the mechanisms driving
the divergent trajectories of blacks and whites. A number of leading hypotheses (the importance
of parental and environmental contributions grow over time, black students suffer worse summer
setbacks, standardized tests are poor measures, interactions between black students and schools
interferes with learning) fail to explain why Blacks lost ground. The only hypothesis that
received any empirical support was systematically lower quality schools for Blacks relative to
Whites. The primary evidence in favor of this hypothesis emerged from comparisons of test
score trajectories within versus across schools. Including school fixed effects eliminates twothirds of the difference in the learning trajectory of blacks and whites over the first two years of
school. In other words, a White student attending the same school as a Black student loses twothirds as much ground against the typical White student as does the Black student. Nonetheless,
the evidence on school quality as the driving force in the racial gaps in Fryer and Levitt (2004)
was largely circumstantial and subject to numerous important caveats.1
1

There are at least three limitations to the argument that school quality is the mechanism behind black

underachievement in Fryer and Levitt (2004). First, Hispanics also attend worse schools than whites, yet their test
scores converge to those of whites. Second, because the assignment of children to schools depends in large part on
residential location, school fixed effects is in many ways equivalent to neighborhood fixed effects. Third, controlling
for a wide range of school inputs (which should capture important aspects of school quality) does little to lessen the
gap.

3

In this paper, we extend the analysis offered in Fryer and Levitt (2004) in three
directions. First, data from ECLS through the third grade have recently become available,
allowing us to extend the analysis from first grade to third grade. Second, we have obtained the
restricted use version of the data which contain detailed information on additional geographic
indicators down to the zip code level. Third, we investigate an additional explanation for the
emerging Black-White test score gap, namely, that the set of skills tested in the third grade
systematically differ relative to those in kindergarten, and that Blacks perform worse on the
skills emphasized in the later years.
A number of stylized facts emerge in this paper. We find that Blacks continue to lose
ground relative to Whites in second and third grade at a pace consistent with the losses observed
between kindergarten and first grade. On average, blacks are losing .10 standard deviations per
year relative to whites in the first four years of school. In contrast to Fryer and Levitt (2004),
however, systematic differences in school quality appear much less important in explaining the
differences in test-score trajectories by race once the data are extended through third grade;
Blacks lose substantial ground relative to whites within the same school and even in the same
classrooms. That is, including school or teacher fixed effects do little to explain the divergent
trajectories of black and white students between kindergarten and third grade. Hispanics continue
to make up their inferior initial conditions relative to whites, while Asians continue to make
gains. Explanations other than school quality that we have explored also fail to convincingly
account for the growing gap between Blacks and students of other races.
By the end of third grade, even after controlling for observables, the black-white test
score gap is evident in every skill tested in reading and math except for the most basic tasks such
as counting and letter recognition which virtually all students have mastered. The largest racial
4

gaps in third grade are in the skills most crucial to future academic and labor market success:
multiplication and division in math, and inference, extrapolation, and evaluation in reading. Any
initial optimism is drowned out by the growing gap.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the data used in
the analysis. Section III presents the basic facts and patterns in test scores in the first four years
of school using these data. Section IV investigates the extent to which alternative hypotheses
can account for the fact that Blacks are steadily losing ground. Section V concludes.

II. The Data
The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is a nationally
representative sample of over 20,000 children entering kindergarten in 1998. Thus far,
information on these children has been gathered at five separate points in time. The full sample
was interviewed in the fall and spring of kindergarten, spring of first grade, and spring of third
grade. The sample will ultimately be followed through fifth grade.2 Roughly 1,000 schools are
included in the sample, with an average of more than twenty children per school in the study. As
a consequence, it is possible to conduct within-school analyses.
A wide range of data is gathered on the children in the study, which is described in detail
at the ECLS website http://nces.ed.gov/ecls. We utilize just a small subset of the available
information in our baseline specifications (although Fryer and Levitt (2004) show that similar

born in 2001 through the first grade.

results are obtained in a much more fully specified model). Students who are missing data on
test-scores, race, or age are dropped from our sample.
Summary statistics for the variables we use in our core specifications are displayed by
race in Table 1, with White referring solely to non-Hispanic Whites.3 Our primary outcome
variables are math and reading standardized test scores.4 Standardized tests were administered to
the full sample in the fall and spring of kindergarten and first grade and the spring of third
grade.5 The reading test includes questions designed to measure basic skills (print familiarity,
letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, and word recognition),
vocabulary and comprehension, listening and reading comprehension, knowledge of the
3

There are also a small number of children in the data whose racial status is classified as “other.” These include

Hawaiian, mixed race, and Native American students. Such students are included in our regressions, but not shown
in the summary statistics table.
4

These tests were developed especially for the ECLS, but are based on existing instruments including Children’s

Cognitive Battery (CCB); Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised (PIAT-R); Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test-3 (PPVT-3); Primary Test of Cognitive Skills (PTCS); and Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational BatteryRevised (WJ-R). Students are administered the test questions orally, as it is not assumed that they know how to
read. A “general knowledge” exam was also administered. The general knowledge test is designed to capture
“children’s knowledge and understanding of the social, physical, and natural world and their ability to draw
inferences and comprehend implications.” We limit the analysis to math and reading scores, primarily because of
the comparability of these test scores to past research in the area. In addition, there appear to be some peculiarities
in the results of the general knowledge exam.

See Rock and Stenner (2004) for a more detailed comparison of

ECLS to previous testing instruments.

The tests were also given in the spring of kindergarten, but we limit our focus to the endpoints of the available

data. The kindergarten spring test results are in all cases consistent with the results presented in the paper.

alphabet, phonetics, and so on. The math test evaluates number recognition, counting,
comparing and ordering numbers, solving word problems, interpreting picture graphs, addition
and subtraction, multiplying and dividing, place value and rate and measurement. The values
reported in the table are item response theory (IRT) scores provided in ECLS-K, which we have
transformed to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one for the overall sample on each of
the tests and time periods.6 In all instances sample weights provided in ECLS-K are used.7
White students on average score .307 standard deviations above the mean on the math
exam in the fall of kindergarten, whereas Black students perform .356 standard deviations below
the mean on that test, yielding a Black-White gap of .663 standard deviations. By the spring of
third grade, that gap has increased to .882 standard deviations. The initial Black-White gap on
reading is smaller (.400 standard deviations). Like math, however, the reading gap widens
substantially to .771 standard deviations by the end of third grade.
The remainder of Table 1 presents summary statistics for the other variables used in the
analysis. In contrast to the test score variables, for which we have observations at multiple
points in time, many of the control variables are either not time varying, (e.g., birth weight),
6

Because children were asked different questions depending on the answers they provided to the initial questions

on the test, IRT-adjusted scores are preferable to simple test-score measures reflecting the number of correct
answers a child provided. For more detail on the process used to generate the IRT scores, see chapter 3 of the
ECLS-K Users Guide. Our results are not sensitive to normalizing the IRT scores to have a zero mean and standard
deviation equal to one.
7

Because of the complex manner in which the ECLS-K sample is drawn, different weights are suggested by the

providers of the data depending upon the set of variables used (BYPW0). We utilize the weights recommended for
making longitudinal comparisons. None of our findings are sensitive to other choices of weights, or not weighting
at all.

collected only once, or exhibit little variation over time for individual students. The most
important of these covariates is a composite measure of socio-economic status constructed by the
researchers conducting the ECLS survey. The components used in the SES measure are parental
education, parental occupational status, and household income. Other variables included as
controls are gender, child’s age at the time of enrollment in kindergarten, WIC participation (a
nutrition program aimed at relatively low income mothers and children), mother’s age at first
birth, birth weight, and the number of children’s books in the home.8

There are substantial

differences across races on many of these variables. Black children in the sample are growing
up under circumstances likely to be less conducive to academic achievement than White
children: lower socio-economic status, fewer children’s books in the home, etc. Hispanics are
also worse off than Whites on average. For Asians, the patterns are more mixed. The set of
covariates we include match those used in Fryer and Levitt (2004). While this particular set of
covariates might seem idiosyncratic, the results we obtain with this small set of variables mirrors
the findings when we include an exhaustive set of over 100 controls. In light of past research
that has had great difficulty making the Black-White test score gap disappear, we focus on the
results from these very parsimonious regressions to highlight the fact that the sharp differences
between our results and earlier studies is not primarily a consequence of the availability of
different covariates in the ECLS. It is important to stress that a causal interpretation of the
coefficients on the covariates is likely to be inappropriate; we view these particular variables as
proxies for a broader set of environmental and behavioral factors.

III. Basic Facts about Racial Differences in Early Achievement
8

A more detailed description of each of the variables used is provided in the appendix.

8

Table 2 presents a series of estimates of the racial test score gap in math for the tests
taken over the first four years of school. The specifications estimated are of the form:

yit = ρ i γ + xit β + ε it

(1)

where yit denotes an individual i’s test score in grade t and xit represents an array of student
level social and economic variables describing each student’s environment. The variable ρ i is a
full set of race dummies included in the regression, with White as the omitted category.
Consequently, the coefficients on race capture the gap between the named racial category and
Whites. Our primary emphasis, is on the Black-White test score gap. In all instances, the
estimation is done using weighted least squares, with weights corresponding to the sampling
weights provided in the data set. When there are multiple observations of social and economic
variables (SES, number of books in the home, and so on), for all specifications, we only include
the value recorded in the fall kindergarten survey.9 Our analysis consists of a series of crosssectional regressions; we do not use the panel structure of the ECLS for any of our analysis.
The odd numbered columns of Table 2 present the differences in means, not including
any covariates. These results simply reflect the raw test score gaps reported in Table 1. The
even numbered columns mirror the main specification in Fryer and Levitt (2004). Controls
include: the composite indicator of socio-economic status constructed by the ECLS survey
administrators, number of children’s books in the home and that variable squared, gender, age,
birth weight, indicator variables for having a mother whose first birth came when she was a
teenager or over 30 (the omitted category is having a first birth in one’s twenties), and WIC
participation. These covariates generally enter with the expected sign. Older children, those
9

Including all the values of these variables from each survey or only those in the relevant years does not alter the
results.

9

with higher birth weights, those with older mother’s at the time of first birth all score better,
although the benefit of entering school at a later age decreases steadily over time. Children on
WIC do worse on the tests, suggesting that this variable is not capturing any real benefits the
program might provide, but rather, the fact that eligibility for WIC is a proxy for growing up
poor that the SES variable is not adequately capturing. Socio-economic status and the number of
children’s books in the home are important predictors of test scores at each grade level. A onestandard deviation increase in the SES variable is associated with a .30 increase in fall
kindergarten math scores and a .29 increase in spring first grade math scores. The number of
books is also strongly positively associated with high kindergarten test scores in math.10
Evaluated at the mean, a one-standard deviation increase in the number of books (from 72 to
137) is associated with an increase of .143 (.115) in math and reading respectively. This variable
seems to serve as a useful proxy for capturing the conduciveness of the home environment to
academic success. The other variables tend to enter with the expected sign and have magnitudes
that are similar to those reported in Fryer and Levitt (2004).11
The estimates in Table 2 suggest that, controlling for other factors, black students score
only slightly worse in math than whites upon kindergarten entry, but their trajectories after entry
into school are very different. 12 After controlling for our parsimonious specification, blacks
score .099 standard deviations below whites in the fall of kindergarten. This deficit increases to
10

The marginal benefit associated with one additional book decreases as more books are added. Beyond roughly

150 books, the marginal impact turns negative. Only 16 percent of the sample lies above this cutoff point.
11

As an additional robustness check, we have also entered the components of the SES measure, parental education,
parental occupation, and income, individually. In all cases, the components enter with the expected sign. Income is
the biggest contributor to test scores. The black coefficient is unchanged.
12
The specifications in Table 2 are restricted to observations with valid test scores on all 4 tests. Because of this, our
sample size is 2089 observations smaller than Fryer and Levitt (2004). There is little change in the results when we
restrict samples for a given tests to students with valid scores on that tests.

10

.279 standard deviations by the spring of first grade and .382 by the spring of third grade. Thus,
the Black-White test score gap grows by almost .30 percentiles between the fall of kindergarten
and spring of third grade. The table also illustrates that the control variables included in the
specification shrink the gap a roughly constant amount of approximately .50 standard deviations
regardless of the year of testing. In other words, although Blacks systematically differ from
Whites on these background characteristics, the impact of these variables on test scores is
remarkably stable over time. Whatever factor is causing Blacks to lose ground is operating
through a different channel.
In contrast to Blacks, Hispanics gain substantial ground relative to whites, despite the
fact that they are plagued with many of the social problems that exist among blacks – low
socioeconomic status, inferior schools, and so on. One explanation for Hispanic convergence is
increases in English proficiency, though we have little direct evidence on this question.13 Calling
into question that hypothesis is the fact, discussed below, that after controlling for other factors
Hispanics do not test particularly poorly on reading, even upon school entry. Controlling for
whether or not English is spoken in the home does little to affect the initial gap or the trajectory
of Hispanics.14 The large advantage enjoyed by Asians in the first two years of school is
maintained. We also observe striking losses by girls relative to boys on math – over two-tenths
of a standard deviation over the four year period. While not the subject of this analysis, this is a
finding deserving of further study.

13

Hispanics seem to increase their position relative to whites in states where English proficiency is known to be a
problem (Arizona, California, and Texas).
14
Hispanics are also less likely to be participate in pre-school, which could explain their poor initial scores and
positive trajectory. However, including controls for the type of program/care children have prior to entering
kindergarten – does nothing to explain why Hispanics gain ground.

11

Table 3 is identical to Table 2, but presents reading scores rather than math scores.
Surprisingly, after adding our controls, Black children actually score slightly better than Whites
in reading in the fall of kindergarten. Like math, however, blacks lose substantial ground
relative to other racial groups in the first four years of school. The coefficient on the indicator
variable black is .13 standard deviation above whites in the fall of kindergarten and .282 standard
deviations below whites in the spring of third grade, or a loss of over .40 standard deviations for
the typical Black child relative to the typical White.15 The impact of covariates – explaining
about one-half of a standard deviation gap between Blacks and Whites at all ages -- is similar to
that in the math regressions. Hispanics experience a much smaller gap relative to Whites, and it
does not grow. The early edge enjoyed by Asians diminishes by third grade. In stark contrast to
the results on math, girls are not losing ground relative to boys in reading.
In an effort to uncover the factors that are associated with the divergent trajectory of
blacks, Table 4 explores the sensitivity of these losing ground estimates across a wide variety of
sub-samples of the data. We report only the race coefficients and associated standard errors in
the table. The top row of the table presents the baseline results using a full sample and our
parsimonious set of controls (corresponding to Tables 2 and 3). In that specification, Blacks lose
an average of .283 standard deviations in math and .41 in reading relative to Whites over the first
four years of school. Blacks lose similar amounts of ground across most subsets of the data. In
part because of imprecise estimates, only in a few cases can we reject the null hypothesis of no
differences in the amount of ground lost by Blacks across sub-groups. Black females fare
somewhat better relative to White females than Black males do relative to White males, but it is
worth bearing in mind that White females do quite poorly relative to White males. The results
15

The numbers here for third graders are similar in magnitude to those reported in NAEP scores (see Campbell,
Hombo, and Mazzeo 2000).

12

appear to be similar across quintiles of the socio-economic status distribution and by family
structure. Blacks in schools with less than fifty percent Blacks lose somewhat less ground to the
Whites in their schools than do Blacks in mostly Black schools. Blacks in private schools do not
appear to do especially well or poorly.16 The single greatest outlier we observe is among Blacks
in the Western region, who start school doing well but fall far behind. Hispanics in the West do
not exhibit this same pattern; they remain steady versus Whites. We have not found a
compelling explanation for the poor performance of Blacks in the West. One point worth noting
is that Blacks in the West are losing the great majority of this ground relative to Whites in the
same classrooms, so differential school quality across races does not appear to be the answer.
The results presented in Tables 2 – 4 maintain the assumption that children of different
races are equally responsive to changes in covariates. Cross-race differences in coefficients are
potentially important because they affect the interpretation of the racial test score gap estimates
in the preceding tables. Black children experience worse environments on average. If Black
children do not derive as much benefit from improvements in socio-economic status, number of
children’s books, higher birth weight, etc., then our earlier results suggesting that including
covariates lessens the racial gaps may be exaggerated. Further, within-race analysis allows one to
see how the relationship between particular covariates (number of children’s books, e.g.) and
achievement varies over time within race.
16

We have also experimented with limiting the sample to the set of children for whom there is substantial overlap

across races in background characteristics. More specifically, we ran probits with an indicator variable for Black as
the dependent variable and the full set of covariates as predictors. When we drop from the sample the roughly 30
percent of students whose predicted probability of being Black is less than 10 percent or greater than 90 percent, the
Black-White gap on math rises slightly and the reading gap becomes closer to zero.

13

Tables 5a and 5b present within-race estimates of our basic specifications in math and
reading, respectively. Columns 1 and 6 replicate the coefficient estimates from the full sample.
The remaining columns present results within a specific race category. For the most part,
responsiveness to covariates appears similar across races. One difference is that the Black
children in our sample may be somewhat less responsive to changes in socio-economic status
than Whites: a one-standard deviation improvement in socio-economic status for a Black child is
associated with a .192 standard deviation increase in math scores, compared to .343 for a White
child, but the results are more similar on reading scores.

IV. Why are Black students losing ground?
Understanding why Black students fare worse in the first four years of school is a
question of paramount importance for two reasons. First, knowing the source of the divergence
may aid in developing public policies to alleviate the problem. Second, determining the
explanation for the widening gap will help to determine whether the simple linear extrapolation
over the academic career is a plausible conjecture.
There are a number of plausible explanations as to why the racial gap in test scores grows
as children age: (1) Black children attend lower quality schools on average, (2) the importance of
parental/environmental contributions may grow over time. Since Black children are on average
disadvantaged in this regard, they fall behind, (3) Black-White differences in earlier test scores
were masked because of the type of material asked or the difficulties in testing skills among the

14

youngest school-age children. Differences may only manifest themselves in more involved,
higher order problems.17 We address each of these hypotheses in turn.18

Are Black students losing ground because they attend worse schools?
Fryer and Levitt (2004) tested six theories to explain why black kids lost ground relative
to whites between fall kindergarten and spring first grade. The only hypothesis that received any
empirical backing was differences in school quality. It was shown that, relative to Whites
attending the same schools, Blacks lost only a small amount of ground. Both Blacks and the
Whites that attended schools with Blacks lost substantial amount on tests relative to Whites at
other schools. But, evidence for the theory was far from conclusive. For instance, Fryer and
Levitt (2004) were not able to explain the divergent trajectories of blacks with any of the
extensive observable school inputs provided by ECLS-K.19 And, because of the link between
residential location and school attendance, school fixed effects also captures neighborhood
effects. Thus, it is not obvious how to separately identify the effect of school quality from one in
which the influence of neighborhood quality on student outcomes grows with age.

17

There is some suggestive evidence in this regard, though we are unable to empirically validate the claims – thus
treating it as an open question. Rock and Skenner (2004) argue that kindergarten test scores measure a child’s
“product” (readiness, e.g.) whereas later tests measure a child’s “process” (ways of learning, e.g.). And, it is thought
that the latter is more correlated with “intelligence.”
18
We have also tested whether or not racial differences in family disruption (i.e. compositional changes in the
household or the number of times that a child changes schools) or frequency of repeating grades can explain the
divergent trajectory of blacks. Neither receives any empirical backing.
19
Indeed, Fryer and Levitt (2004) write, “There are important weaknesses in the argument that differential school
quality explains the divergent trajectories of Whites and Blacks. First, the observable measures of school inputs
included in Table 7 explain only a small fraction of the variation in student outcomes. For instance, adding the
school input measures to our basic student-level test-score regressions only increases the R-squared of the regression
by .05. Second, even after the school input measures are added to the test-score regressions, the gap between Blacks
and Whites continues to widen. Third, both Hispanics and Asians also experience worse schools than Whites, but
neither of those groups is losing ground. Because of these important weaknesses in the story – perhaps as a
consequence of poor school quality measures in the data – the evidence linking school quality differences to the
divergent trajectories of Blacks can be characterized as no more than suggestive.”

15

When we revisit this hypothesis armed with more years of data, the empirical support for
school quality being the primary source of divergent Black-White test scores weakens, as shown
in Table 6. This table compares estimates of the Black-White test score gap over time, with and
without school-fixed effects. All of the specifications in the table include the parsimonious set of
covariates, although only the coefficient on the Black-White gap is shown in the table. We
eliminate students attending racially homogeneous schools from the sample. Blacks continue to
lose substantial ground by the end of third grade. When school-fixed effects are included in the
regression (columns 6-10), the Black-White test-score gap is identified off of differences
between Blacks and Whites attending the same school. As reported in Fryer and Levitt (2004),
the estimates of ground lost by Blacks shrinks to less than one-third of the magnitude in the full
sample when comparing fall kindergarten and spring first grade test scores, and is not
statistically different from zero in these specifications.20 The additional data on third graders
leads us to believe that school quality is less important than we had initially conjectured. A
comparison of Columns 5 and 10 make this clear. After including school fixed effects, two-thirds
of the difference between blacks and whites remain. Indeed, all of the ground lost between first
grade and third grade by Blacks is within rather than across schools.
One explanation is that, due to tracking within schools, the educational experiences of
Blacks and Whites might nonetheless be different even at the same school. The results presented
20

This finding in some ways parallels Currie and Thomas’s (1995) finding that students early gains for students

who attend Head Start tend to disappear due to low quality schools that these students later attend. Consistent with
Currie and Thomas (1995) we do not find a positive effect of Head Start on student test scores even in kindergarten,
once other factors are controlled for. This finding is also related to Krueger and Whitmore (2001) and Phillips,
Crouse, and Ralph (1998), who find that the black-white gap widens as a result of poorer quality schools.

16

in the table, however, are essentially unchanged when we include teacher fixed effects, so that
the differences are identified off of children in the very same classroom. We conclude that
neither school quality nor tracking within schools is the primary explanation for black digression.

Does the importance of parental/environmental inputs grow as children age?
Black children may tend to grow up in environments less conducive to high educational
attainment. If the importance of parental/environmental inputs grows as children age, one would
expect to observe the raw gaps widening between Blacks and Whites, but to the extent our
control variables adequately capture a child’s environment, the residual gap after including all
the covariates would remain constant. In fact, however, the residual gap increases more than the
raw gap contradicting this explanation. Indeed, from a theoretical perspective, one might expect
that the importance of parental inputs declines with age. Prior to reaching school age, the
relative share of educational inputs provided by parents is very large. Once school starts, much
of the burden for educating is shifted to the schools. Our empirical evidence does not, however,
provide much support for this conjecture either.21

Did the type of material tested change to the detriment of blacks?
One possible explanation for the divergent trajectories of blacks and whites relates to the
nature of the material tested. Rock and Stenner (2004), for instance, hypothesize that the skills

In a recent paper, Todd and Wolpin (2003) have argued a slightly different point, which is that current
test scores may reflect both current home and environmental inputs, as well as lagged values of these inputs. To the
extent that current and lagged environments are highly correlated, controlling for current inputs is likely to yield
similar estimates on average of the racial test score gap, and indeed that is the case. Controlling for our parsimonious
specification yields a coefficient on black of -.382 in the third grade math regression and -.249 in reading. Adding
lagged socioeconomic and home environment variables changes these coefficients to -.373 and -.273 respectively.

tested at kindergarten entry are less correlated with general intelligence then the later tests, and
Blacks typically score better on achievement tests than on tests of aptitude. When starting
school, kids know very little – irrespective of their environment. As children age, their ability
and social environment might matter more as they start to learn increasingly abstract concepts. It
is in this regard that racial differences in home environment, parenting, peer group norms, and
economic status could play a major role.22 Arguing against such a hypothesis, as Rock and
Stenner (2004) note, is the fact that test scores in the fall of kindergarten are strongly predictive
of test scores in spring of third grade; if the two tests are capturing very different sets of skills,
this would not be expected.23
To further explore whether “higher order” thinking could potentially explain the puzzle
of black underachievement, we investigate black-white learning trajectories by specific types of
skills. Table 7 reports the unadjusted means, by race, of children in fall kindergarten, spring first
grade, and spring third grade on questions assessing specific sets of skills. In the raw data,
Blacks lag Whites somewhat on virtually all types of questions, except those which are mastered
by virtually all students of a given grade level. That is true both at entry to school, and even
more so by the end of third grade. Note that the only skills with much variance by the end of
third grade are those that are associated with concepts virtually no kindergartner had mastered:
multiplication and division, rates and measurement, extrapolation, and so on.
Table 8 reports the results of probits, controlling for other covariates, of Black-White
differences in mastery rates for particular skills. The dependent variable in the analysis is set
equal to one if a student is assessed as having a ninety percent plus probability of having
22

This theory, if true, also re-introduces the possibility that genetics could play a role. Because we have little
evidence on this either way, we choose to exclude it while noting that it is a possibility.
23
Nor does the answer appear to be that the kindergarten test is especially noisy. As Rock and Stenner (2004) note,
the reliability of the kindergarten test is high.

mastered a subject, and is equal to zero otherwise. The same set of covariates used earlier in the
paper is also included here, although the coefficients on these variables are not reported in the
table. The coefficients reported in the table are the marginal effect of being Black, evaluated at
the sample mean. Standard errors are reported in parentheses, and the mean level of mastery
among Whites is reported in square brackets. Controlling for observables, upon entry to school
the gaps between Whites and Blacks tend to be small. This is true on both math and reading
skills, and regardless of whether the skill is mastered by many of the students or relatively few of
the students. Over time, Black students lose ground in virtually every skill area, except the most
basic skills that are mastered by virtually all students in the grade. In addition and subtraction,
which is challenging for many first graders regardless of race, the Black students lag
significantly in first grade, but both Blacks and Whites achieve almost complete mastery by third
grade. In that subject, as well as some of the basic reading skills like “words in context,” a few
percent of Blacks fail to master the material even though almost all Whites do. Multiplication
and division, as well as “literal inference,” display a pattern which is far more disturbing. By the
spring of third grade, over 85 percent of White students have mastered these subjects, but
mastery rates are 15-20 percent lower for Blacks, even after controlling for other factors.
It is difficult to know precisely what conclusion to draw from these results. To the extent
that the pattern of Black skill acquisition as students age follows the path of the basic skills, i.e.
Black students master the material, but at a somewhat later age than White students, the patterns
maybe construed as encouraging. The implication would be that Black students, although
lagging Whites at any particular point in time, are on parallel trajectories. Much more troubling,
it would seem, is the possibility that as the skills become more difficult, e.g. division, a nontrivial fraction of the Black students may never master the skills. If these skills are inputs into
19

future subject matter, then the racial gap may be further magnified. While the data available thus
far cannot speak definitively in determining which of these scenarios is more likely, the patterns
in Table 8 do raise the specter of the latter scenario being possible.24

V. Conclusion
The racial achievement gap remains a stubborn reality. Using newly collected data on a
recent cohort from the ECLS, we document substantial Black-White test score gaps in both math
and reading that grow at approximately .10 standard deviations per year that children are in
school. The divergence in test scores relative to Whites is not apparent for either Hispanics or
Asians.
The explanation as to why Blacks are losing ground proves elusive. Fryer and Levitt
(2004) test a wide range of hypotheses, finding some empirical support for only one explanation:
differential school quality across races. When the data are extended to cover an additional two
years of schooling, however, the support for even this hypothesis weakens. We also explore
whether the growing racial test score gap could be attributed to the inherent difficulties in testing
achievement at especially young ages, or the possibility of increasing importance of home inputs
for the development of higher-order thinking, but can provide no compelling evidence
confirming these hypotheses either.

24

Arguing against that hypothesis is the fact that the estimated labor market returns to a marginal year of education
are typically found to be at least as high for Blacks as for Whites, suggesting that Blacks continue to learn skills
valued by the labor market at a pace equal to Whites throughout the course of their education.

Data Appendix
The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is a nationally
representative sample of 21,260 children entering kindergarten in 1998. Thus far, information on
these children has been gathered at four separate points in time. The full sample was interviewed
in the fall and spring of kindergarten and spring of first grade. All of our regressions and
summary statistics are weighted, unless otherwise noted, and we include dummies for missing
data. We describe below how we combined and recoded some of the ECLS variables used in our
analysis.
Socio-economic Composite Measure.
The socioeconomic scale variable (SES) was computed by ECLS at the household level for the
set of parents who completed the parent interview in Fall Kindergarten or Spring Kindergarten.
The SES variable reflects the socioeconomic status of the household at the time of data
collection for spring kindergarten. The components used for the creation of SES were:
Father/male guardian’s education; Mother/female guardian’s education; Father/male guardian’s
occupation; Mother/female guardian’s occupation; and Household income.

Number of Children’s Books.
Parents/guardians were asked “ How many books does your child have in your home now,
including library books?” Answers ranged from 0 to 200.

Child’s Age.

21

We used the Child’s Age at Assessment Composite variable provided by ECLS. The Child’s age
was calculated by determining the number of days between the child assessment date and the
child’s date of birth. The value was then divided by 30 to calculate the age in months.

Birth Weight.
Parent’s were asked how much their child weighed when they were born. We multiplied the
pounds by 16 (and added it to the ounces) to calculate birth weight in ounces.

Mother’s Age at First Birth.
Mothers were asked how old they were at the birth of their first child.

Notes: Coefficients are from probit regressions, with values reported in the table being marginal effects
evaluated at the sample mean. The dependent variable is a dichotomous measure of skill mastery,
defined to be equal to one if a student is assessed as having a 90 percent or greater likelihood of
mastery in a given skill, and equal to zero otherwise. The particular skill tested
is reported in the left-hand column of the table. Although not reported in the table,
the specifications include the full set of other controls used in regressions reported in prior tables.
Standard errors are in parentheses. The mean of the dependent variable for white students
is reported in square brackets. In cases where virtually no students or virtually all
students have mastered a subject, we do not report results.
