    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate how communication within banks affects small business lending. Using travel time between a bank\u2019s headquarters and its branches to proxy for the costs of communicating soft information, we exploit shocks to these travel times to evaluate the impact of within bank communication costs on small business loans. Consistent with Stein\u2019s (2002) model of the transmission of soft information across a bank\u2019s hierarchies, we find that reducing headquarters-branch travel time boosts small business lending in the branch\u2019s county. Several extensions suggest that new airline routes facilitate the transmission of soft information, boosting small firm lending.\n\n",
