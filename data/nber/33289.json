    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore how socio-economic background shapes academia, collecting the largest dataset of U.S. academics\u2019 backgrounds and research output. Individuals from poorer backgrounds have been severely underrepresented for seven decades, especially in humanities and elite universities. Father\u2019s occupation predicts professors\u2019 discipline choice and, thus, the direction of research. While we find no differences in the average number of publications, academics from poorer backgrounds are both more likely to not publish and to have outstanding publication records. Academics from poorer backgrounds introduce more novel scientific concepts, but are less likely to receive recognition, as measured by citations, Nobel Prize nominations, and awards.\n\n",
