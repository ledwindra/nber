ABSTRACT
In what order should a developing country adopt policy reforms? Do some policies complement each
other? Do others substitute for each other? To address these questions, we develop a two-country
dynamic general equilibrium model with entry and exit of firms that are monopolistic competitors.
The model includes barriers to entry of new firms, barriers to international trade, and barriers to contract
enforcement. We find that the same reform can have very different effects on other economic outcomes,
depending on the types of distortions present. In our model, we find that reforms to trade barriers and
barriers to the entry of new firms are substitutable, as are reforms to contract enforcement and trade
barriers. In contrast, we find that reforms to contract enforcement and the barriers to entry are complementary.
Finally, the optimal sequence of reforms requires reforming trade barriers before contract enforcement.

1. Introduction
Policy makers in developing economies are called upon to make a wide array of structural
reforms. The International Monetary Fund, in its “Article IV” consultation with Brazil, for
example, recommends that Brazil, among other things, liberalize trade, overhaul the tax system,
and reform the banking sector (International Monetary Fund, 2015). Faced with a multitude of
reforms, in what order should a country adopt policy reforms? If political will limits the scope
for reform, which subsets of reforms are optimal?
To address these questions, we develop a two-country dynamic general equilibrium
model with entry and exit of firms, as in Hopenhayn (1992), that are monopolistic competitors,
as in Melitz (2003). The model includes barriers to the creation of new firms, barriers to
international trade, and barriers to contract enforcement, as in Kehoe and Levine (1993) and
Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004). Although our model is simple, it produces rich firm
dynamics. In countries with imperfect contract enforcement, for example, some firms must
borrow to begin production, earn profits in the domestic market to pay down their debt, and then
accumulate assets to finance their entry into the export market. In spite of these rich micro
dynamics, the model has a balanced growth path that is easy to characterize.
We calibrate the model to match several features of the U.S. economy, focusing on the
size distribution of establishments and the fraction of plants that export. We also consider
distorted economies that have the same preferences and technologies as the United States, but are
on lower balanced growth paths because of one or more policy distortions that increase the
barriers to firm entry, increase the barriers to international trade, or weaken contract
enforcement. Using these distorted economies, we investigate how the sequencing of three
reforms — reducing barriers to firm creation, reducing barriers to international trade, and
strengthening contract enforcement — determines the welfare gain from reform.
We focus on a world with two symmetric countries that coordinate, for example, by
means of a free trade agreement, to enact identical reforms at the same time. We parameterize
the three reforms — to entry barriers, trade barriers, and contract enforcement — so that each
reform enacted separately would produce the same increase in balanced growth path output per
capita.

We consider the six possible sequences of the three reforms. In each sequence, the

second reform follows the first reform by four years, and the third reform follows the second by
four years. We include these lags to reflect political and administrative constraints.
1

How important is the sequencing of reforms? To answer this question, we compute the
welfare difference between the best and worst reform sequences in terms of both the per-year
real income increment and the share of period-zero consumption that the household in our model
would need to be indifferent between the two sequences of reforms. The household needs an
extra 4.8 percent of its period-zero consumption to be indifferent between the best and the worst
sequence of reforms. In terms of the per-year real income equivalent, we find the difference
between the best and worst sequence of reforms amounts to a perpetual increase of 0.11 percent
of real income per year. To put that into perspective, researchers in the business cycle literature
follow Lucas (1987) in finding welfare gains of this order of magnitude when they consider
permanently eliminating business cycle variation — we find these gains from merely changing
the order in which the same three reforms are carried out.
We find that the best sequence of reforms is to first decrease trade costs, then to improve
contract enforcement, and, finally, to decrease the cost of firm creation. This result is driven by
the behavior of firm entry in the model. The increase in competition from the lower trade costs
leads to a strong selection of firms in the economy in which the expansion of efficient firms —
who choose to become exporters — crowds out the entry of less efficient firms. Reforms to
contract enforcement or entry costs lead to an increase in firm entry — and this entry is biased
toward inefficient firms that would not have been able to enter if trade costs had been lowered
first.

By liberalizing international trade first, we impose the firm selection early, which

dissuades inefficient firms from entering later when contract enforcement and firm entry costs
are reformed.
With similar reasoning, we find that first improving contract enforcement, then
decreasing trade costs, and finally decreasing firm entry costs is the worst sequence of reforms.
Under this sequence, the reform to enforcement generates an increase in firm creation. Many of
these new firms would not have been able to enter if trade costs had been reformed first. As
monopolistic competitors, firms in our model never choose to exit production, but die
exogenously over time. This generates hysteresis, as firms that have entered do not exit, even as
they become less profitable. For simplicity, we have abstracted from a fixed production cost,
which would yield endogenous firm exit. If we include a fixed production cost, but one that is
smaller than the cost of creating a firm, firms would still delay exit, generating the same type of
hysteresis we have in our model with only exogenous firm exit. Reform sequences that generate
2

entry of inefficient firms in the beginning of the reform period saddle the economy with less
efficient distributions of firms during the transition, reducing the welfare gain from reform.
We should stress that the welfare differences we find are driven solely by the sequencing
of the reforms. Regardless of the order in which the reforms are implemented, all of the
equilibria converge to the same balanced growth path.
How do reforms interact with each other? We classify reforms as being substitutes if,
once a country has enacted one reform, the percentage increase in GDP from enacting the other
reform decreases. Similarly, two policies are complements if, once a country has enacted one
reform, the percentage increase in GDP from enacting the other reform increases. We find that
reforming trade costs is a substitute for reforming enforcement or reforming entry costs, but
reforming entry costs and enforcement are complements. Again, this result is driven by the
incentives for firm entry and exit. Lowering trade barriers increases competition from foreign
firms, generating selection that makes it more difficult for less efficient firms to enter the
domestic market. Reforming enforcement or entry barriers, however, makes it easier for these
less-efficient firms to enter.

These two types of reforms work against each other, so

implementing one reform will weaken the impact of implementing the second one.
Since both enforcement and entry reform make it easier for firms to enter the domestic
market, the two reforms are complementary. The complementarity of enforcement reform and
entry cost reform implies that, if policy makers are constrained to only implement two reforms,
they should choose these two and skip the reforms to international trade.
There is a large literature on the sequencing and interaction of policy reforms. Some of
this research, for example, Aziz and Wescott (1997), Edwards (1990), and Martinelli and
Tommasi (1997), focuses on less developed countries, especially those in Latin America.
Another part of this literature, for example, Campos and Corcelli (2002), focuses on the
transition economies in Eastern Europe. The collection of papers edited by Krueger (2000)
combines research on the two areas. This existing literature is mostly concerned with the timing
of capital account liberalization and the associated cross-border capital flows, typically in a
representative-firm framework.
The capital account does not play a role in our model of two symmetric countries.
Rather, our focus is on the firm-level implications of structural reform and the ways that firm
entry and exit depend on the sequencing of reforms. Nonetheless, our results are relevant for the
3

debate in this literature. In comparing economic growth in Mexico and China, for example,
Kehoe and Meza (2011) conclude that Mexico would have experienced better economic
performance subsequent to its rapid growth during the period 1950–1981 if it had opened to
trade and foreign investment early in this period. Our model provides theoretical justification
and an intuition for this conclusion: If a country is going to eventually reform foreign trade and
investment, it is better to do this early in its industrialization process so that the economy has a
composition of firms more suited to competition in international markets.
The structural reform literature typically considers a particular policy distortion in
isolation. Closer to our work, however, is a growing literature that analyzes the impact of
multiple frictions in heterogeneous firm models. Buera, Kaboski, and Shin (2011) and Bah and
Fang (2014) construct models with both financial frictions and firm entry costs. They show that
the larger are entry costs, the more sensitive are firms to financial frictions. Their work is related
to our analysis of the complementarity of reforming these two distortions, but their focus is on
the steady-state differences in aggregate output and productivity and not the sequencing of
reforms or the transitional dynamics from reform.
Our model is simple and stylized. The simplicity of our model allows us to focus on a
limited set of results for which we can develop intuition. Our framework could be generalized
substantially, however, and doing so would be worthwhile. We could, for example, model trade
costs as iceberg transportation costs or tariffs rather than as the fixed trade costs in our model,
which can be thought of as non-tariff trade barriers. While we model our two countries as
symmetric and we study symmetric reforms, we could instead include more than two countries in
our model and we could model them as asymmetric. We suspect the most significant departures
from our results would be generated by asymmetric reforms. If a country unilaterally lowers the
costs of foreign entry into its market, domestic households would benefit from more varieties of
foreign goods, for example, but unilateral trade liberalization would generate an unfavorable
shift in the terms of trade that could make domestic households worse off.

Although

generalizations of our model are likely to change many of our results, we suspect that our most
important result — that any reform package that includes a trade reform should include it early in
the sequence of reforms — is robust. Any sequence of reforms that pushes the trade reform to
later in the sequence would induce firms to pay fixed costs to enter early in the reform sequence
even though these firms would later be too inefficient to enter.

In Section 2, we develop a dynamic two-country general equilibrium model with three
policy distortions. In Section 3, we characterize the balanced growth path of this model. In
Section 4, we use a calibrated version of the model to quantitatively investigate the gains from
various reform sequences. In Section 5, we conclude.
2. Model
In this section we develop a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model based on Chaney
(2008) and Asturias et al. (2015). There is a representative household in each country. The
production side of the economy comprises a representative final good producer and a continuum
of monopolistically competitive intermediate goods producers. The intermediate good firms face
an entry cost to operate domestically, a trade cost, and endogenous borrowing constraints that
arise from the limited enforcement of contracts.
2.1. Households
The representative household in country i  1, 2 is endowed with Li units of labor, which it
inelastically supplies to the intermediate goods firms. The problem of the household is
max  t  0  t log Cit


s.t. Pit Cit  qit 1 Bit 1  wit Li  Dit  Bit

(1)

Cit  0 , no Ponzi schemes, Bi 0 given,
where  , 1    0 , is the discount factor, Cit is consumption of the final good, Pit is its price,
qit 1 is the price of a one-period bond, Bit 1 is the face value of one-period debt purchased, wit is
the wage rate, and Dit is the aggregate dividends paid by domestic firms — those firms that were
created in country i . We assume that there is no borrowing and lending across countries, so the
price of bonds can differ across countries.
2.2. Final good producers
We model perfectly competitive final good firms that purchase intermediate goods and assemble
them to produce the final good. The representative final good firm in country i solves

where pitd ( ) and yitd ( ) are the price and quantity of intermediate good  and  itd is the set of
intermediate goods produced for domestic consumption in country i , and pejt ( ) and y ejt ( ) are
the price and quantity of intermediate good  and ejt is the set of intermediate goods produced
for export in country j  i .

The elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods is

1 (1   )  1 , and Yit is real aggregate output.

2.3. Intermediate goods producers
There is a continuum of heterogeneous intermediate good firms. In each period, a measure i of
potential entrants arrives with marginal productivities, x , drawn from the distribution Fit  x  . A
potential entrant must hire  id units of domestic labor if it will produce for the domestic market.
The potential entrant who enters at time t begins production in t  1 .

Potential entrants who

choose not to enter cannot enter in subsequent periods.
Intermediate good producers may also choose to hire  ie units of foreign labor to produce
for the foreign market. We require foreign labor for the trade cost because we think of this fixed
6

cost as being partially determined by the government in the foreign country. If a firm chooses to
enter the export market at time t , it begins to export in t  1 . Furthermore, we assume that

 ie   id , although, for asymmetric countries, this does not imply that w j ie  wi id .
To keep our analysis simple, we assume that, once a firm has paid the fixed cost to
operate domestically or to export, there are no further fixed costs associated with either activity.
Thus, a firm does not voluntarily exit domestic production or cease exporting to the other
country. Firms die with probability  every period.
The firm producing good  uses labor to produce according to
yit ( )  xit ( )lit ( )

(6)

where xit ( ) is the productivity of firm  .
Conditional on choosing to sell to the domestic market, firm  chooses its domestic
price to maximize profits,

(9)

Since we assume that there are no transportation costs or tariffs, the firm charges the same price
in the export and domestic markets, piet ( )  pidt ( ) . Notice that every firm with productivity x
chooses the same price. In what follows, we no longer characterize a good by its name  but by
the productivity x of the firm that produces it.
The fixed costs that firms pay to enter domestic and foreign markets must be paid before
production takes place. This implies that firms must finance these costs by issuing debt. The
amount of debt the firm can issue, however, is limited by the strength of contract enforcement in
the economy. We assume that the manager of the firm can abscond with a fraction 1  i of the
7

value of the firm in the case of default. We interpret this possibility as the result of imperfect
contract enforcement.
The price of risk-free debt is qit 1 . When a firm issues debt, there is a possibility that the
firm will exogenously cease operations and not repay its debt. This exogenous firm death occurs
with probability  . In equilibrium, the price of the firm’s debt will be 1    qit 1 , so that the
return on firm debt matches the risk-free rate,

(10)

An existing exporter, with productivity x and existing debt b , chooses new holdings of
debt, b , and dividend payments, d , to solve the dynamic programming problem

Vite (b, x)  max d  qit 1 1    Vite1 (b, x)
s.t. Vite (b, x)  1  i  Vite (0, x)

(11)

d   itd ( x)   ite ( x)  1    qit 1b ' b
d 0.

The first constraint is the enforcement constraint, which limits the amount of debt that the firm
can issue, where i , 1  i  0 , governs the degree of contract enforcement in country i . If

i  1 , there is perfect contract enforcement; if i  0 , there is no contract enforcement and
borrowing is impossible. We rule out i  0 , since firms in our model require some borrowing
for production to take place. The second constraint defines the dividend payment. The firm
cannot choose negative dividends, as this would circumvent the enforcement constraint.
Besides choosing its debt level b , an existing non-exporter chooses either to continue to
produce for only the domestic market and pay dividends d n or to enter the export market and
pay dividends d e . An existing non-exporter solves
Vitn (b, x )  max d n  qit 1 1    Vitn1 (b ', x ), d e  qit 1 1    Vite1 (b ', x )

(12)

dn  0, de  0.

Notice that, if the firm chooses to become an exporter, the time-to-build requirement implies that
the firm pays the fixed cost ( w jt ie ) in the current period, but does not export until the next
period.
2.4. Entry decisions
In each period, measure i of potential entrants is born. Their productivities are drawn from a
Pareto distribution,


 x 
, x  xi g t ,
Fit ( x)  1  
t 
x
g
 i 

(13)

which has a mean that grows at rate g  1 . We impose the standard condition for this sort of
model,  (1   )    0 , which is necessary for the distribution of profits to have a finite mean.
The continual improvement of the technologies available to new firms drives the long-run
aggregate growth in the model: Older firms exit and are replaced by new entrants who are, on
average, more productive.
A potential entrant with productivity x does not produce at age k  0 because of the
time-to-build requirement. This potential entrant borrows to pay the fixed cost wit id only if two
conditions are satisfied. First, the value of the firm must be greater than zero if it enters and,
second, there must exist a debt path such that the enforcement constraints in all subsequent
periods are satisfied. The first condition is satisfied if
 wit id

Vitn1 
, x   0 .
 1    qit 1 

(14)

Notice that the first term in the value function is the debt of the firm in t  1 if it sells only in the
domestic market. We denote xˆid0t as a potential entrant’s minimum productivity necessary to
enter at time t . More generally, xˆiktd

is the minimum productivity of firms of age k that

d
 xˆid,k 1,t 1 for
continue to operate at time t . Since there are no fixed costs to pay each period, xˆikt

all k  1 . That is, firms only exit the domestic market exogenously.

9

Similarly, a potential exporter with productivity x and debt b pays the fixed cost wit ie
to enter the export market only if the value of the firm if it enters the export market is greater
than the value of the firm if it remains only serving the domestic market,

(15)

and if there exists a debt path such that the enforcement constraints in all subsequent periods are
satisfied. Notice that the first term in the exporter value function in (15) is the debt in period
t  1 of the firm after it pays the fixed cost to enter the export market.

Finally, a potential entrant with productivity x borrows and pays both the fixed cost
wit id to enter the domestic market and the fixed cost w jt ie to the export market only if the value

of the firm if it enters both markets is greater than the value of only entering the domestic
market, which in turn is greater than zero,

(16)

and if there exists a debt path such that the enforcement constraints in all subsequent periods are
satisfied.
We denote xˆike t as the minimum productivity of firms of age k  0 who pay the trade
cost at age   0 . Consequently, a potential entrant’s minimum productivity necessary to enter
both the domestic market and the export market at age zero is xˆie00t . In a country with perfect
enforcement ( i  1 ), any firm that will ever export pays the export fixed cost at age   0 . As
enforcement worsens ( i falls), less efficient exporters take longer to export because they must
decrease

their

debts

to

satisfy

the

enforcement

constraint,

and,

consequently,

xˆie00t  xˆie01t  ...  xˆie0 nˆit t , where nˆit denotes the oldest age at which a firm who enters in time t pays
e
the trade cost. Finally, define xˆikt
as the minimum productivity of all exporting firms with age

e
 xˆie,k 1,k 1,t , since
k  1 . For the cohort of firms with age k  nˆit  1 , we would expect that xˆikt

firms in this cohort are still paying the trade cost to become exporters. For older cohorts with

10

e
 xˆie,k 1,t 1 , since firms in this cohort are no
age k  nˆit  1 , the export thresholds are given by xˆikt

longer becoming exporters.
The measure of exporting firms, ite , evolves according to

ite 1  ite  ite  1    ,

(17)

where ite is the measure of new exporters,

 .
ˆit

(18)

The first term in the right-hand side of (18) is the measure of new entrants who immediately pay
the trade cost to access the export market, and the second term is the measure of existing age- k
firms who pay the trade cost in period t .
The measure of all domestic firms, itd , evolves according to

itd1  itd  itd  1    ,

(19)

where itd is the mass of new firms,





itd  i 1  Fit  xˆid0t  .

(20)

2.5. Equilibrium
We focus on balanced growth paths and the transitions between them, but before defining a
balanced growth path, we first define an equilibrium. To define an equilibrium, we need to
provide, as initial conditions, the measures of domestic and exporting firms of all ages operating
in period zero. To define these measures, we need the minimum productivities of operating
firms, xˆ1dk 0 , xˆ2dk 0 , and  xˆ1ek  0 , xˆ2e k  0  . Using the minimum productivities to specify the measures
0


of firms operating in period zero requires us to specify the distributions of productivities from
which these existing firms were drawn. We do this using Pareto distributions analogous to those
for firms born in period zero and later,

3. Balanced growth
In this section, we prove that the model has a balanced growth path, and we characterize the
behavior of its key variables. To make our characterization of a balanced growth path simple,
we assume that  id is low enough relative to  ie so that on the balanced growth path the
marginal entrant never exports and only produces for the domestic market. We also assume that
the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods is large enough, 1 (1   )  2 , so that a
firm’s profits decrease over time.
Definition: A balanced growth path is an equilibrium, for the appropriate initial conditions,
such that

We could have specified a balanced growth path only in terms of the values of the
variables in period zero rather than sequences for all t  0 . Our definition makes very clear,
however, that a balanced growth path corresponds to a set of sequences where the elements all
either grow by the same factor, g , or stay constant.
On the balanced growth path, growth in the economy is driven by the continual entry of
new firms that are, on average, more productive than the previous cohorts. The growth rate of
output, consumption, and both components of income grow at the rate g  1 , which is the rate at
which the mean of the productivity distribution of potential entrants grows.

Next, we

characterize the productivity cutoff for the marginal entrant on the balanced growth path.
Lemma 1. On any balanced growth path, the enforcement constraint of the marginal entrant at
time t holds with equality only when k  1 ,
Vitn1 bi ,0,t 1  xˆid0t  , xˆid0t  1  i  Vitn1  0, xˆid0t 

(30)

for all t , k  1 and x  xˆktd .
Proof: See Appendix B.
Notice that, although the enforcement constraint holds with equality for the marginal
entrant when k  1 , it does not bind in the sense that the constraint distorts the decision of this
marginal entrant. Instead, the enforcement constraint binds in determining the marginal entrant.
If we loosen the enforcement constraint by increasing i , firms with lower productivity enter.
14

This is an attractive feature of the model in terms of characterizing balanced growth paths, and it
is the product of the costs of entry being fixed costs. Either firms pay this fixed cost and enter or
they do not.
Using (29), we can derive the expression for xˆid0t ,

The cutoff in (31) looks similar to that in a static model except that the entry cost in that
expression is replaced with id , which we interpret as the effective entry cost. Notice that
changes in the enforcement constraint change the effective entry cost that firms face. In the case
that i approaches 0, then id approaches infinity.
We now characterize the productivity cutoff for the marginal exporter.
Lemma 2. On any balanced growth path, the enforcement constraint of the marginal firm of age
k at time t who pays the trade cost at age 

(35)

The lemma says that, at some ages, the marginal exporter is determined by the
enforcement constraint, but at other ages, it is determined by the condition that entering the
export market is at least as profitable as not entering. The enforcement constraint binds in the
sense that it distorts the timing of when a firm begins to export. Conditional on exporting though,
it does not distort the decisions of the firm.
Using (33), we can derive an expression for the constrained marginal exporter’s
productivity, xˆikect ,

and iw  w j 0 / wi 0 , Yi  Y j 0 / Yi 0 , and iP  Pj / Pi for j  i . Like the condition in (31), the
cutoff in (36) looks similar to that in a static model for the minimum productivity of an exporter,
except that the fixed cost in that expression is replaced by iec , which we interpret as the
effective trade cost. Once again, changes in the enforcement constraint change the effective
trade cost that firms face. Changes in the enforcement parameter in (37) affect the effective
trade cost differently from the way they do in the effective entry cost in (32). In particular, as i
approaches zero, iec does not approach infinity although id does. The reason is that firms can
self-finance using profits from the domestic market and then use that to pay the fixed cost to
export. Also, iec is decreasing in age  , and therefore xˆikect is also decreasing in age. In other
words, less efficient firms take longer to export.
Using (35), we can derive the expression for the unconstrained marginal exporter’s
productivity xˆikeut ,

(39)

Notice that the expression for xˆikeut is increasing in age  . The reason is that the more a
firm waits to pay the trade cost, the more profitable it needs to be. Thus, in an unconstrained
environment, any exporter will pay the trade cost at age   0 . In general, the marginal exporter
productivity is
xˆike t  max  xˆikect , xˆikeut  .

(40)

Let nit ( x) be the age at which a firm of productivity x born at time t pays the trade cost.
Furthermore, let nˆit be the oldest age of the latest export entrant, which can be found by
nˆit  min   1, 2,...,  | xˆikeut  xˆikect  .

(41)

The intuition for this is simple. If contract enforcement is sufficiently bad, less efficient firms
must pay down their existing debt to finance the trade cost. As the firms age, however, their
profits decline as the wage increases. Therefore, at age nˆit  1 , it is no longer profitable to enter
the export market, even though the enforcement constraint is no longer binding. Thus, the
minimum productivity for exporting firms that are of age k at time t is given by

(42)

The first line of (42) refers to the cohort of firms who still have some firms paying the trade costs,
and thus the minimum exporter productivity is given by the marginal constrained exporter who
paid its trade cost in the previous period. The second line refers to the cohort of firms who no
longer have firms paying trade costs; in this case, the minimum exporter productivity is

17

determined by the marginal unconstrained exporter at the last age any firm pays the trade cost,
given by nˆit .

conditions. Furthermore, the cutoffs xˆid0t and xˆike , ,t  k , given by (31), (36), (38), and (40), also
grow by g . Finally, from the first-order condition of the household and applying the balanced
growth path conditions, we obtain qit 1   g . See Appendix B for details. □
To better understand the model’s balanced growth paths, we turn to the evolution of debt,
profits, and dividends of firms that service only the domestic market and those that do not
immediately become exporters. As Figure 1 shows, a firm that only operates in the domestic
market during its life takes on debt at age zero. The firm then uses its profits in the subsequent
18

periods to pay off that debt. Upon paying off the debt, the firm issues all of its profits as
dividends. Notice that the profitability of the firm declines through time. This is because, as
more productive firms enter, an existing firm becomes relatively unproductive.
Figure 1: Debt, profits, and dividends of a
domestic firm

Figure 2: Debt, profits, and dividends of an
eventual exporter

The debt, profits, and dividends of a firm that does not immediately export, as seen in
Figure 2, looks similar to the firm that only operates in the domestic market except for two
differences. First, an eventual exporter is more productive and thus pays down its debt faster.
Second, after paying down its debt, the firm does not issue dividends. Instead, the firm saves so
that it can pay the fixed cost to enter the export market. After entering the export market, both
the firm’s profitability and its debt level increase. Next, the firm uses its profits to pay down this
additional debt. Upon retiring its debt, the exporting firm issues all of its profits as dividends.
4. Quantitative exercises
In this section, we use the model to perform quantitative exercises to determine how the
sequencing of reforms affects the welfare gains from these reforms. For simplicity, we model
two symmetric countries in which L1  L2 , 1  2 , 1d   2d , 1e   2e , 1   2 , x1  x2 . We
begin by calibrating the model to the U.S. economy, which trades with a symmetric economy
that represents the rest of the world.
We examine the effects of conducting symmetric reforms. In particular, we investigate
the effects of six possible reform sequences, with each reform occurring every four years. The
first reform is unexpected by the agents, but the subsequent reforms are foreseen.
19

We focus on symmetric countries and symmetric reforms only to keep our analysis
simple. We could calibrate the model to asymmetric countries, and we could analyze the impact
of asymmetric reforms.
4.1.

Calibration

We choose parameters so that the model’s equilibrium matches several features of the U.S.
economy, focusing on the size distribution of establishments and the number of plants that
export. We summarize the parameters in Table 1.
We normalize the labor endowment, L , to one.

We set the fixed cost to operate

domestically,  d , so that the model matches the average establishment size in the United States
of 16.0 employees (1981–2000, U.S. Census, Statistics of U.S. Businesses). We choose the trade
cost,  e , so that the model matches the observed fraction of manufacturing plants that export,
0.21 (Bernard, et al., 2003). The parameter that governs enforcement,  , is set so that the model
matches the debt-to-revenue ratio of firms aged less than five years, 0.27 (2003, Survey of Small
Business Finances). The Survey of Small Business Finances surveys firms with less than 500
employees, which account for most of the new firms created in the United States. For example,
in 2010–2011, 99.98 percent of new firms employed less than 500 workers (U.S. Census,
Statistics of U.S. Businesses).
The curvature parameter of the Pareto distribution,  , is set so that the model matches
the standard deviation of the U.S. establishment size distribution, which averages 91.2 workers
(1981–2000, United States Census, Statistics of U.S. Businesses). The probability that the firm
dies,  , is set so that the establishment death rate is 10 percent per year (2010–2011, U.S.
Census, Statistics of U.S. Businesses). The discount factor,  , is set to generate a real interest
rate of four percent per year. Finally, we set the entrant productivity growth factor, g , so that, in
the balanced growth path, output per capita grows at two percent per year — the historical U.S.
average.

There are three parameters that we do not calibrate. We set the elasticity of substitution
across goods, 1 / (1   ) , to three. This elasticity of substitution is similar to that of Simonovska
and Waugh (2014). These authors find the elasticity of substitution for a Melitz (2003) model to
be 3.69. We set the mass of potential entrants,  , and the minimum productivity level, x , to
one.

Given our assumption that firm productivities are distributed according to a Pareto

distribution, these final two parameter choices are without loss of generality as long as the mass
of potential entrants is large enough and the minimum productivity is low enough that the entry
cutoffs are always strictly greater than xg t .
4.2. Creating a benchmark distorted economy
Using the calibrated model, we create a benchmark distorted economy that has all three
distortions (high entry costs, high trade costs, and poor enforcement of contracts). We use this
benchmark distorted economy to study the optimal sequence of reforms. The spirit of the
exercise is that this economy has the same technology and preferences as the United States, but
the economies have different levels of distortions.
As a first step, we solve for the balanced growth path of three economies, each of which
is distorted by a single policy. In the first economy, we raise entry barriers so that output drops
by three percent, which requires increasing  d from 8.6 to 10.0.

In the second distorted

economy, we raise trade costs so that output drops by three percent, which requires raising  e

21

from 40.9 to 91.9. In the third distorted economy, we lower contract enforcement so that output
drops by three percent, which requires lowering  from 0.39 to 0.32.
The distortions we have imputed above are comparable, as each of them results in a
decline in income of three percent in the balanced growth path. The benchmark distorted
economy is the one that has all three distortions. Since we are considering the case of symmetric
reforms, the same parameters are used for both domestic and foreign countries.
4.3. Comparing balanced growth paths
In this section, we study the interaction among the three policies using information from the
balanced growth path. In the next section, we consider the transitions paths from the reforms and
the welfare effects of the reform sequences.
Table 2 reports the policy parameters for each balanced growth path along with their
corresponding income levels.

The income levels have been normalized to the benchmark

distorted economy for easier comparison. Notice that reforming trade costs induces the largest
increase in income when starting from the benchmark distorted economy, even though all
reforms increase income by the same amount when they are the only distortion present.

reforms

We categorize policy pairs as being either complementary or substitutable. Two policies
are substitutes if, once a country has enacted one reform, the percentage increase in GDP from

22

enacting the other reform decreases. Similarly, two policies are complements if, once a country
has enacted one reform, the percentage increase in GDP from enacting the other reform increases.
We can determine whether policies are substitutes or complements using the information
in Table 2. For example, suppose that we begin with all three distortions present. We find that
reducing trade costs and reducing entry costs are substitutes. To arrive at this conclusion, we
observe that reducing trade costs increases output by 3.71 percent (from 100.0 to 103.71). If the
economy already had lower entry costs, however, the same reduction in trade costs increases
output by only 3.20 percent (from 103.44 to 106.75). We summarize our findings in Table 3:
Reforms that reduce trade costs are substitutable with the other reforms, but contract
enforcement and entry barriers are complementary.

We can gain intuition into why policies are substitutes or complements by analyzing how
the number of varieties available to households changes in each balanced growth path. To do so,
we decompose the change in the total number of varieties available to consumers,
V D NE D E F E



,
V
V
V
V

(48)

where V is the mass of varieties available to consumers, D NE is the mass of domestic nonexporters, D E is the mass of domestic exporters, and F E is the mass of foreign exporters.
The results from this decomposition are reported in Table 4, which has been sorted in
descending order of the percentage change in total varieties. We find that reforms can lead to
very different outcomes in the composition of firms in the economy. When we reduce trade
costs, we find a small increase in the total varieties available to consumers, 0.4 percent.
Reducing trade costs leads to fewer inefficient firms that exist to only serve the domestic market,
but this reduction in domestic-oriented firms is offset by increases in domestic exporting firms
and foreign exporters.

reform

Notes: Columns report the percent change, from the initial balanced growth path to the new balanced growth
path, when a single reform is implemented in the benchmark model.

The model generates larger increases in the number of varieties with improvements in
contract enforcement (22.3 percent) and reductions in entry costs (17.9 percent). This increase in
the number of varieties comes from firms that only serve the domestic market. Reforming
contract enforcement or firm entry costs has a small negative impact on export activity.
Notice that the number of exporting firms declines even though reforms to contract
enforcement benefit exporting firms by improving their ability to borrow to pay the trade cost.
This outcome is the result of two opposing forces in the model. First, after a reform, firms find it
easier to enter the export market, which increases the number of exporters. This can be seen by
examining the effective trade cost that firms face in (37): An increase in  leads to a reduction
in the effective trade cost. Second, the general equilibrium effects from the surge of new firms
crowds out exporting firms by increasing the real wage.

The increase in the real wage

dominates, and the number of exporting firms shrinks.

In the appendix, we report the

decomposition in (48) for an economy implementing a second and third reform (Table 9 and
Table 10). We consistently find that reforms to enforcement lead to the largest increase in the
number of varieties available to consumers, followed by reforms to entry costs. Furthermore, it
is always the case that reforms to enforcement and entry costs, through general equilibrium
effects, lead to a crowding out of exporting firms.
The results in Table 4 highlight the forces that drive the complementarity or
substitutability of reforms.

Reforming enforcement or entry costs makes entry easier for

relatively inefficient firms, increasing the number of non-exporting firms. Trade liberalization,
however, decreases the number of non-exporting firms and transfers resources to exporting
firms. When these two types of policies are implemented together, they work against each other,
24

reducing the effectiveness of the second reform. Reforming enforcement costs and entry costs
together combines two policies that increase the number of non-exporting firms, making the
second reform more effective.
The distribution of firm types in the economy is reflected in the aggregate price index.
Reforms to enforcement or entry costs lead to more firms, which lowers the price index.
Reforms to trade costs lead to an expansion of low-price firms, which also lowers the price index.
In Table 5, we report the percentage change in the price index along with the domestic and
import price indexes. As expected, we see that all reforms lead to reductions in the overall price
index. Reforms to entry costs or enforcement work through the domestic price index, while
reforms to trade costs work through the import price index.

Notes: Columns report the percent change, from the initial balanced growth path to the new

The behavior of the price index allows us to see why reforming the trade sector leads to
the largest gain in balanced growth path output (Table 2) even though the reform generates the
smallest change in the number of varieties available for consumption (Table 4). Reform to
enforcement or entry costs increases the number of relatively low-productivity firms that can
profitably produce for the domestic market. Following these reforms, the domestic price index
falls modestly. This decrease in the price index is driven mostly by the increase in varieties —
the new entrants charge relatively high prices. Trade reform, in contrast to the other two,
generates a large decrease in the import price index, which leads to the largest overall decline in
the aggregate price index, and, thus, the greatest increase in real output among the three reforms.
The decrease in the import price index comes from two sources. First, new imported varieties
from abroad increase the varieties available for consumption. Second, these imported varieties
are produced by relatively high-productivity firms in the other country, so the new imported
25

varieties are sold at low prices. This second effect generates a stronger decrease in the import
price index.
4.4. Evaluating the welfare gains from one reform
As a next step, we compute the transition path for the case in which one unexpected reform is
implemented. In Sections 4.5 and 4.6, we will measure the welfare gains in the case in which
two and three reforms are implemented.
Table 6 reports the welfare gains from conducting each of the three reforms in terms of
the change in permanent real income. We calculate permanent real income as

exp 1    t 1  t 1 log Cit  .



(49)

First, we see that the welfare differences across reforms can be large, amounting to 0.40 percent
in terms of real income. Second, we find that, although the reform to trade costs results in the
highest balanced growth path consumption level (Table 2), it is reforming entry costs that results
in the highest welfare gain once we consider the transition dynamics. The intuition behind this
result can be seen in Figure 3, where we plot consumption, detrended by g t , following the
reform. Compared with the entry cost reform, we observe a larger decrease in consumption
following the trade cost reform, because there is a large increase in the number of firms that pay
the fixed trade cost. This initial drop in consumption results in the reform to entry costs being
more beneficial, even though the trade cost reform eventually results in higher consumption.
Finally, we find that, after reform, the economy takes significant time to reach the new balanced
growth path. For example, in the case of trade reforms, it takes the economy 17 years to be 0.1
percent away from the new balanced growth path.

4.5. Evaluating the gains from conducting two reforms
Next, we evaluate the gains from enacting two reforms. The second reform takes place four
years after the first.

We impose the four-year lags to reflect political and administrative

constraints in implementing reform. The first reform is unexpected, but, after the first reform,
agents foresee the second reform.
Table 7 reports the welfare gains, in descending order, from implementing each possible
sequence of two reforms. We find significant differences in welfare outcomes. The difference
27

between the best and worst reforms is 0.34 percent of real income, which is equivalent to 17.3
percent of first period consumption.

Notes: Real income is computed according to (49). The calculation includes the
transition from the initial balanced growth path to the new balanced growth path when
two reforms are implemented in the benchmark model.

The best sequence of reforms first lowers entry costs and then improves contract
enforcement. The second best reform sequence is the same pair of reforms, but with their order
reversed. Notice that, if only two reforms are conducted, then policy makers should avoid
reductions in trade costs. This is for two reasons. First, as can be seen in Figure 4, trade cost
reforms induce a larger initial drop in consumption compared with other reforms. Second, trade
reforms are substitutable to the other reforms, while reforms to entry costs and contract
enforcement are complementary.
If trade costs are to be reformed, then sequencing plays an important role: It is preferable
to lower trade costs before conducting other reforms. This difference is most stark in the case of
reforming trade costs and then enforcement. The gains from this sequence are 0.11 percent
higher than from the sequence in which we reform enforcement and then trade costs. This is
because, if we reform entry costs or enforcement first, we increase the number of relatively
inefficient non-exporting firms in the economy. If we then reform trade costs, the selection
induced by the exporting decision will make these new firms obsolete. The hysteresis generated
by the entry cost means that the economy will carry these inefficient firms for several periods
before they eventually die off. The optimal sequencing of reforms imposes the selection from
28

reducing trade costs first, so that the reform to enforcement or to entry costs does not generate
the entry of soon-to-be unwanted firms.
Figure 4: Detrended consumption for two reforms

4.6. Evaluating the gains from conducting three reforms
To determine the optimal sequence of reform, we compute the equilibrium of the model under
six possible sequences of three reforms. As before, the first reform is unexpected by agents.
After the first reform takes place, the agents foresee reforms two and three, which take place four
years and eight years after the initial reform.
In Table 8, we report, in descending order, the welfare gain from the six possible reform
sequences. We find that the difference between the best and worst sequence is 0.11 percent of
real income, which is equivalent to 4.8 percent of first period consumption. Since each sequence
of reforms generates the same balanced growth path, this increase in welfare is solely the result
of differences in the transition paths that arise from the ordering of reforms.
Table 8 indicates that the best reform sequences involve reducing trade costs first and the
worst reform sequences involve improving enforcement first. We also find that improving
enforcement before lowering trade costs is a poor combination. It is striking to note that in the
best and worst sequences, entry cost reforms occur last: The difference is the ordering of reforms
to trade costs and enforcement.

Notes: Real income is computed according to (49). The calculation includes the transition from the
initial balanced growth path to the new balanced growth path when three reforms are implemented in
the benchmark model.

In Figure 5 we plot the evolution of detrended consumption in the best and worst reform
sequences. Reforms take place in years one, five, and nine. First, notice the dip in consumption
that takes place when trade costs are lowered. This is driven by the entry of new exporters, who
divert labor from production to pay the fixed cost to enter the export market. This dip in
consumption is smaller in the case of the best reform sequence (–9.4 vs. –11.0 percent). Second,
notice that, following the reform in trade costs, consumption in the worst reform sequence is
consistently below that of the best until they converge to the same balanced growth path.

30

Figure 5: Detrended consumption for three reforms

As in the two-reform case — and for the same reasons — we find that trade costs should
be reformed before entry costs or enforcement. Decreasing trade barriers leads to a strong
selection on productivity that makes it harder for less efficient firms to compete. In Figure 6
and Figure 7, we plot the mass of exporters and the mass of non-exporters in the best and worst
reform sequences. Each sequence of reforms will eventually generate the same distribution of
firms, but the transition paths can be quite different and lead to large and persistent differences in
the composition of firms in operation.
In the best reform sequence, the mass of exporters begins to grow immediately, and the
initial decline in non-exporting firms is driven mostly by the conversion of non-exporting firms
to exporting firms. Converting non-exporting firms to exporting firms takes time, as constrained
firms need to improve their balance sheets before they are able to finance the trade costs. In year
five, the mass of exporters sharply increases, as the reform to contract enforcement increases the
availability of finance. The decline in the mass of non-exporters levels off in year five as
enforcement reform lowers the productivity threshold for entry into the domestic market. When
entry costs are reformed in year nine, the mass of non-exporters begins to increase as it
converges to its balanced growth path.

31

In the worst reform sequence, the improvement in enforcement leads to an increase in
non-exporting firms. This inflow of new firms increases the real wage, which has a slight
negative effect on the mass of exporters. In year five, the trade costs are reformed. This reform
generates an increase in exporters and an increase in the productivity level needed to profitably
enter the domestic market. Since reforms to enforcement already occurred, the economy had
already increased its stock of low productivity non-exporters. These firm types are no longer
profitable from the point of view of a new entrant, but the firms that are already in the market
will remain until they die exogenously. Carrying these inefficient firms along the transition path
decreases the gains from this sequence of reforms.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we construct a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with three potential
policy distortions: entry costs, trade costs, and poor enforcement of contracts. We calibrate the
model to the United States and subsequently create a benchmark distorted economy in which all
three distortions are present. We use the model to quantitatively study the optimal sequencing of
reforms. Our findings indicate that the order in which reforms are conducted has an impact on
the gains from these reforms. In particular, if a country undertakes three reforms, then welfare
gains are highest if it reduces trade costs first. Furthermore, we find that the sequencing of
reforms has an impact on the distribution of firms for a significant number of years. If a country
is going to eventually reform foreign trade, welfare gains are higher if it does so early in its

32

industrialization process so that the economy has a composition of firms that are more suited to
competing in international markets.

Proof of lemma 1:
The enforcement constraint does not bind for a firm with no debt. Thus, we will derive an
expression for Vi ,nt  k (bi ,k 1,t  k ( x), x) of an age k firm that holds debt. The value of a firm that
never exports (12) can be written as

This means that the firm will use all profits to pay down debt, and once all debts are paid off, the
firm will pay all profits in dividends. Because firms discount future dividends by exactly the
price at which firms issue debt, they are indifferent about the sequence of paying down debt and
issuing dividends. However, this bond policy relaxes the enforcement constraints the most, since
it involves the earliest repayment of debt. Substituting (51) into (50), we obtain

This means that the firm will use all profits to pay down debt, and once all debts are paid off, the
