    "abstract": "\n\nThe Boxstep method is used to maximize Lagrangean functions in the context of a branch-and-bound algorithm for the general discrete optimization problem. Results are presented for three applications: facility location, multi-item production scheduling, and single machine scheduling.  The performance of the Boxstep method is contrasted with that of the subgradient optimization method.\n\n",
