    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper estimates the magnitude and distribution of surplus from the knowledge worker gig economy using data from an online labor market. Labor demand elasticities determine workers\u2019 wages, and buyers\u2019 past market experience shapes both their job posting frequency and hiring rates. We \ufb01nd that workers on the supply side capture around 40% of the surplus from \ufb01lled jobs. Under counterfactual policies that resemble traditional employment regulation, buyers post fewer online jobs and \ufb01ll posted jobs less often, reducing expected surplus for all market participants. We \ufb01nd negligible substitution on the demand side between online and o\ufb04ine jobs by assessing how changes in local o\ufb04ine minimum wages a\ufb00ect online hiring. The results suggest that neither online or o\ufb04ine knowledge workers will bene\ufb01t from applying traditional employment regulation to the online gig economy.\n\n",
