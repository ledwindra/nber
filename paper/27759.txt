ABSTRACT
Using county-level data on COVID-19 mortality and infections, along with county-level
information on the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the United States, we
examine how the speed of NPI adoption affected COVID-19 mortality. Our estimates suggest
that advancing the date of NPI adoption by one day lowers the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4
percent. This finding proves robust to alternative measures of NPI adoption speed, model
specifications that control for testing and mobility, and across various samples: national,
restricted to the Northeast region, excluding New York, and excluding the Northeast region. We
also find that the adoption speed of NPIs is associated with lower infections, as well as lower
non-COVID mortality, suggesting that these measures slowed contagion and the pace at which
the healthcare system might have been overburdened by the pandemic. Finally, NPI adoption
speed appears to have been less relevant in Republican counties, suggesting that political
ideology might have compromised their efficiency.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic and the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented

in many countries to suppress the contagion have unsettled lives fundamentally and cratered the
global economy. Epidemiologists contend that NPIs—such as safer-at-home orders, closures of
non-essential businesses and schools, or bans on large gatherings—combined with testing,
tracing, and isolating, are the only options to fight the pandemic until a vaccine is identified and
made widely available or societies achieve herd immunity (Ferguson et al., 2006; Pichler et al.,
2017; Tian et al., 2020). Yet, the intensity and vigor of NPI implementation have varied across
countries, reflecting skepticism regarding their efficacy and concerns about their social and
economic impacts.
In the United States, where COVID-19 has taken a high toll in terms of infections and
mortality, skepticism toward NPIs reigns high among the public and legislators (Funk and
Tyson, 2020). Early in the pandemic, President Trump famously criticized NPIs by remarking
that “the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.” The nation remained divided on the
effectiveness of NPIs, even as the pandemic raged from March to early May 2020 in the
northeast, spreading to the rest of the country thereafter.

Surveys show that conservative

Republicans expressed more skepticism about NPIs than liberal Democrats (Funk and Tyson,
2020).

State and local implementation and lifting of NPIs were often driven by political

ideology.

Republican-governed cities were slower in adopting NPIs, whereas cities led by

Democrats were more aggressive (Willetts, 2020).
Amidst the highly partisan response to the pandemic, the question remains: has the
timeliness of NPIs been effective in saving lives in the United States? Have these interventions
helped reduce the spread of the virus? Has political ambivalence on NPIs influenced their

1

effectiveness? The aim of this paper is to address these questions using county-level data on
mortality, infections, and NPIs.
If NPIs have not been successful in the United States, that would mean the government
has needlessly cratered the economy, compromised children’s education, disrupted lives and
livelihoods, and reduced the pace at which herd immunity can be achieved—ultimately
validating public skepticism about these policies. Arguably, NPIs reduce the pace at which a
population can acquire widespread immunity. For this reason, a number of countries, including
the United Kingdom in the initial stages of the pandemic, and Sweden, opted against
implementing NPIs. Additionally, the implementation of NPIs inevitably brings economies to a
halt, resulting in tidal unemployment claims.

Many countries and localities delayed their

adoption and effective implementation to lessen their economic and social effects. These delays
could have adversely affected the spread of the pandemic. Indeed, if NPIs are effective at
reducing contagion, the politicization of NPIs can be blamed for the ambivalence and hesitation
toward their implementation. This ambivalence and hesitation could explain the United States’
failure to contain the virus, even as other developed countries have successfully reduced
infections and mortality.
A couple of studies in the United States have investigated the effect of stay-at-home
orders on infections and mortality from COVID-19 (Dave et. al. 2020; Fowler et al. 2020).1
Both studies find that NPIs are associated with lower infection and mortality rates. We build on
this research by assessing the relevance of the adoption timing of two NPIs—safer-at-home
orders and non-essential business closures—on mortality.

Our research differs in that we

There is growing international research on the effects of NPIs including Yun, Chen and Shi (2020) using Chinese
data, Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020) using data from Spain, and Hsiang et al. (2020) and Imai et al. (2020) using
cross-national data.

specifically study the effect of NPI timeliness. To that end, we construct a measure that captures
the relative speed of NPI adoption based on a county’s rate of contagion when the NPI was
adopted.2
Further, we investigate whether NPI efficacy differed across counties with different
political ideologies and different degrees of demographic, economic, and health-related
vulnerabilities.

To do the former, we construct a dummy to identify Republican counties,

defined as counties where most residents voted for President Trump in the 2016 election, and
estimate if NPI efficacy differed in those areas compared to other counties. For the latter, we use
several pre-COVID county demographic, economic, and health characteristics to explore the
differential efficacy of NPIs across counties with distinct degrees of vulnerability. Ideally, we
would use data on COVID-19 mortality according to these traits, but such data are not available.
Instead, we use pre-COVID county-level characteristics to explore differences in the relevance
of NPI adoption timing across counties with different characteristics associated with poor
COVID-19 health outcomes. Finally, we explore mechanisms through which NPI adoption
speed might be critical, focusing on the spread of the infection and the ability to avert an
overwhelmed health care system.
A challenge in estimating the causal effect of NPIs on mortality is that these interventions
are adopted in response to the spread and severity of the virus. Because of the likely presence of
reverse causality (i.e., COVID-linked deaths could be the cause behind the adoption of NPIs), a
simple correlation between NPIs and COVID-linked mortality or infection will likely result in
biased estimates, although they would likely be biased downwards. We address this by

and Correia et al. (2020) who studied the effect of NPIs during the 1918 Influenza.

supplementing our primary analysis with an event study examining how COVID-19 death rates
respond to NPI adoption.
Because of the ongoing nature of the pandemic, an additional challenge is the chosen
temporal frame for our analysis. We focus on the early months of the pandemic, capturing when
states and counties first adopted NPIs, through the first re-opening.

This means we are

comparing counties at various initial stages of the pandemic. To address this limitation, we
estimate models that separate specific outliers during that period. Specifically, we experiment
with: (i) restricting samples to Northeastern states that were the epicenter of the pandemic during
our study period, (ii) excluding Northeastern states, and (iii) excluding New York. These sample
modifications allow us to compare NPI speed between counties that experienced roughly similar
stages of the pandemic during our study period.
Any research on the efficacy of NPIs in the United States is affected by the fact that data
on reported infections and COVID-linked mortality are highly correlated with COVID-19
testing, which has varied across the country and over time. In counties with inadequate testing,
reported infections likely underestimate actual infections and deaths attributable to COVID are
likely to be reported as non-COVID mortalities. Further, if testing is correlated with NPIs, it will
confound the estimates of the efficacy of NPIs. We address this by explicitly controlling for
testing. Similarly, to address concerns regarding the possibility that the NPI estimates might be
capturing any endogenous self-distancing potentially taking place prior to the adoption of an
NPI, we include controls for the daily median maximum distance traveled by county residents as
an estimate of mobility at the county level.
To explore the mechanisms at play, we examine how NPI adoption speed affects
infections, and conduct state-level analyses of the association between NPIs and non-COVID

4

deaths. Studies document that non-COVID deaths increased during the period of our study
(Woolf et al. 2020). This could have occurred for various reasons, including the voluntary
postponement of procedures or, in some instances, through an overwhelmed healthcare system.
If timely adoption of the NPIs helped reduce the burden on the healthcare system, they should
also lower non-COVID deaths.
We find that advancing the implementation date of NPIs by one day would have lowered
the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4 percent. The finding proves robust to the use of alternative
measures of NPI adoption speed, to controlling for testing and mobility, and to the removal of
outliers—such as New York and the Northeast region, from the analysis. We also find that the
NPI adoption speed is associated with lower infections and lower non-COVID fatality,
suggesting these measures operated both via slowing down the contagion and the burden of the
pandemic on the healthcare system. We also find that the adoption speed of NPIs proves less
critical in Republican counties, suggesting that the attitudes of the Republican leadership towards
NPIs (e.g. social distancing, wearing masks, business closures) may have compromised their
efficacy.

Data

2.1

Mortality and Infections
To determine how NPIs affected COVID-19 mortality in the United States, we use

county-level data on COVID-19 deaths and infections collected by the Johns Hopkins
University. This data includes information on the accumulated number of daily COVID-19 cases
and deaths reported by state and local health departments (Dong, Du, and Gardner, 2020).3 We

use 2018 population figures from the American Community Survey to derive daily COVID-19
mortality rates by county.
We focus our analysis on the period from February 15, 2020 to April 23, 2020. While the
first confirmed case of COVID-19 occurred in late January, country-wide contagion was
reported starting in late February and early March. We lack information on the timing of reopenings by county.

To avoid confounding the effects of NPI adoption speed with the

continuation of NPI policies, we cap our study period at April 23, 2020, the day before the first
NPI was lifted. 4
We also collect information on state-level testing and overall mortality from the COVID
Tracking Project and the Centers for Disease Control, respectively. Given that the identification
of COVID-19 infections and attribution of causes of deaths are contingent upon detection, we
use the most detailed information available from the COVID Tracking Project—daily test results
by state—to account for variation in testing. 5 We also collect information on mortality by cause
of death from the Centers for Disease Control to estimate non-COVID deaths. 6 We use the most
detailed information available—weekly deaths by state—to explore some of the mechanisms
responsible for our estimated impact of NPIs on COVID-19 mortality.

deaths were reported. This affected five counties in New York (New York City’s five boroughs were originally
grouped under New York county), two counties in Massachusetts (Dukes and Nantucket), Rhode Island’s five
counties, and 22 counties in Utah. In each of these instances, we aggregate population counts and apply population
weights to estimate aggregated county characteristics for these consolidated areas, which in most cases, we collapse
onto the most populous county. Cases and deaths that were not assigned to a particular geographic area are
excluded from our analysis. These consolidations bring our county total to 3,117, down from 3,142.

2.2

Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions
We use data from the National Association of Counties (NACo) and Boston University’s

School of Public Health to identify counties with NPIs in place during our study period. NACo
compiles information on the type and timing of NPIs for every county in the United States. 7 We
complement this information with a comprehensive database assembled by Boston University
researchers that records similar measures taken by states. 8 We focus on two types of NPIs: nonessential business closures and safer-at-home policies.
While there is overlap between non-essential business closures and safer-at-home orders,
business closure policies only restrict the activities of certain businesses, whereas safer-at-home
orders include provisions that close non-essential businesses in addition to restricting individual
movement. Safer-at-home policies—also referred to as “stay-at-home” and “shelter-in-place”—
explicitly restrict the movement and activities of individual residents unless they are engaged in
“essential” activities. 9 These policies prohibit residents from gathering or travelling outside of
their homes unless for an essential activity and, as such, often consist of the closure of nonessential businesses (i.e., restaurants, bars, gyms).

Though policies and enforcement vary,

residents who ignore safer-at-home orders may face a misdemeanor punishable by fine,
imprisonment or both (Harris, 2020).

Mobility

mobile devices are used to sample the movement of individuals (Warren and Skillman, 2020).
We use estimates of the median maximum distance traveled by residents to estimate daily
mobility at the county level. These statistics are available for March 1, 2020 and beyond.
2.4

County Characteristics
To investigate whether NPI efficacy differed across counties with different political

ideologies and different degrees of demographic, economic, and health-related vulnerabilities,
we collect information on a series of county-level characteristics. We use information from the
MIT Election Lab to capture county political affiliation, measured as the Republican vote share
in the 2016 presidential election, which we use to identify Republican counties as those with a
Republican vote share exceeding 50 percent. 11

We collect information on a series of

demographic and socioeconomic characteristics sourced from 2018 5-year American Community
Survey estimates. Specifically, we compile estimates on the percent of county residents that are:
(i) over the age of 65, (ii) without health insurance, (iii) unemployed, and (iv) living below the
federal poverty line. Lastly, we use data from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Service to
measure county-level chronic disease prevalence. We use information from 2017, the latest year
available, to create a comorbidity index that aggregates the percent of Medicare beneficiaries
with chronic diseases associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, including chronic lung
disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma), heart conditions (atrial fibrillation,
heart failure, Ischemic heart disease), cancer, hypertension, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, chronic kidney

standard deviation of 1, with larger values indicating higher comorbidities.
3.

Methodology
Our primary objective is to explore the effectiveness of NPIs on COVID-19 mortality.

To that end, we start by estimating the following difference-in-differences model specification:
(1)

𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽(𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 × 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐 ) + 𝜌𝜌𝑐𝑐 + 𝜗𝜗𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

where the vector 𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 represents the number of COVID deaths per 100,000 in county c and date t.

We consider two different types of NPIs: safer-at-home policies and non-essential

business closures. Our main regressor is an interaction term made up of two variables: (1)
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , a dummy variable indicative of the period in county c when the NPI was in effect; and

(2) 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐 , the relative speed of NPI adoption based on county c’s rate of contagion when

the NPI was adopted. The post-NPI dummy (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) includes a two-week delay to account for

the average amount of time between infection and possible death (Lauer et al., 2020). The
vector 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐 measures the number of days between the adoption of the NPI and the first

day-to-day doubling of county-level infections per capita. 13 We multiply this count by minus

one, so that higher values indicate a faster response. 14 This operationalization allows us to gauge
the impact of both the adoption of a particular NPI, as well as the effect of a faster response.
Equation (1) also includes daily fixed-effects to capture temporal shifts in the incidence
and treatment of the disease across the country, and county fixed-effects to account for time-

infrastructure, and population comorbidities. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.
4.

Descriptive Evidence
Our methodological approach is inspired in the daily variation in COVID-19 deaths and

deaths per capita displayed in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. As shown therein, early- versus
late-adopters of NPIs were seemingly impacted differently. We distinguish among three groups
of counties: (1) early adopters, which include those with safer-at-home or business closure in
place prior to the first day-to-day doubling of infections per capita; (2) late adopters, which
include counties that adopted after the first day-to-day doubling; and (3) counties that never
adopted a safer-at-home or business closure policy during our study period. COVID-19 deaths
began to accelerate in mid-March for early and late adopters, but at notably different rates. Peak
COVID-19 death rates in counties classified as late adopters were over 2.5 times as large as the
peaks in early adopting counties. Also noteworthy is the relative dearth of COVID-19 mortality
in the 311 counties that were not subject to an NPI during our study period. Most of these
counties are located in sparsely populated states (i.e., North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and
Wyoming).
Figure 3 illustrates the staggered adoption of safer-at-home and business closure policies,
which provides the temporal and geographic variation needed for identification. The first NPI
was adopted by the state of California on March 16, 2020. By March 20, a total of 134 counties,
including California’s 58, had an NPI in place. As illustrated in the subsequent maps, most NPI
adoptions occurred in late-March and early-April. By March 30, a total of 1,979 counties were
subject to a safer-at-home, business closure order, or both. This number grew to 2,806 by April
6—after which, no additional NPIs were implemented during the period covered in this study.
10

Table 1 displays basic descriptive statistics for the full sample, and by NPI adoption
timing for the 3,117 counties included in our sample.

Counties were observed daily from

February 15 April 23, 2020 (69 days). The descriptive statistics confirm the trends illustrated in
the figures. COVID-19 infections and mortality were lower in early-adopting counties when
compared to counties adopting NPI measures late, despite the larger number of tests performed
in the latter group. Counties that never adopted the measures were the smallest in size and had
COVID-19 infections and mortality figures that were well below those of late and early NPI
adopters. There are other differences worth noting across counties. For instance, counties that
were early NPI adopters were somewhat between non-adopters and late adopters in terms of size.
In terms of pre-COVID characteristics, the early adopters had higher mobility indexes, a larger
share of elderly and people living in poverty, and were more likely to be classified as
Republican. In contrast, late NPI adopting counties were, by far, the largest in size and had
higher comorbidity indexes. However, differences in unemployment rates and health insurance
were not large across counties that adopted NPIs early, late, or never.
5.

Main Findings and Robustness Checks
Our main objective is to learn about the importance of timing when adopting NPIs in

fighting COVID-19 mortality. If timing proves critical, a secondary objective is to gain a better
understanding of the channels enabling the effectiveness of the NPI in curtailing deaths—an
investigation that involves uncovering heterogenous impacts of the adopted NPIs.
To achieve our main aim, we start by estimating several model specifications of equation
(1). Initially, we simply consider the adoption timing of either business closures or stay-at-home
orders—the most common NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from this exercise
are displayed in Table 2. The baseline specification only includes date and county fixed effects.
11

Subsequently, we control for the level of testing in the state, as well as mobility measured as the
median maximum distance traveled by county residents. COVID testing was inadequate in the
initial months after the outbreak and began to improve over our study period. Controlling for
testing allows us to account for any mechanical association between testing, infections, NPIs,
and COVID mortality. 15 Accounting for mobility allows us to capture the role played by any
endogenous self-distancing irrespective of whether the NPIs were in place. Regardless of the
model specification used, the speed of adoption of NPIs significantly curtails COVID-19 deaths.
Based on the estimates from the most complete model specification, we find that moving up the
implementation date of any of the NPIs (if both were adopted, whichever came first) by one day
lowers the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4 percent.16
o gain a better understanding of which of the two most common NPIs matters the most,
we re-estimate the models including separate measures of adoption speed for each NPI. As can
be seen in Table 3, both measures seem to help curtail deaths. Adopting business closures oneday earlier lowers COVID-19 deaths by 1.5 percent and, similarly, moving up the adoption of a
stay-at-home order by one day would curtail the COVID-19 mortality rate by 1.2 percent. 17
Finally, in Table 4, we conduct several robustness checks to assess the sensitivity of our
findings to: (1) alternative measures of the NPI adoption speed; (2) the application of population
weights to derive nationally representative estimates; and (3) using different samples that
exclude New York and the Northeast region (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) as potential

outliers during the period under analysis, or look at the Northeast region separately. In what
follows, we briefly refer to each robustness check.
As noted earlier, the estimates in Table 2 use a contagion threshold equal to the first dayto-day doubling of infections per capita in each county. In columns (1) and (2) of Table 4, we
experiment with different contagion thresholds: the first day infections per capita exceeded the
national average from January 21, 2020 to March 7, 2020 (column 1), and the first day infections
per capita exceeded the county average prior to any NPI adoption (column 2). 18 Our results
prove robust to the use of these alternative contagion thresholds. Accelerating the adoption
speed of the NPIs by one day lowers the COVID-19 mortality rate by 2 percent in column (1),
and by 4.4 percent in column (2).
Next, we experiment with using population weights to derive nationally representative
estimates. As can be seen in column (3) of Table 4, we continue to find that speeding up the
adoption of the NPIs by one day would have significantly lowered mortality from COVID-19. In
this case by 4.6 percent, as opposed to 2.4 percent using the unweighted estimates of Table 2.
Finally, we test the sensitivity of our findings across different geographic samples. First,
we exclude New York, which was the epicenter of the pandemic during the period under
consideration, to check if our results were driven by its presence in the sample. As can be seen
in column (4) of Table 4, the results are somewhat lower, but remain robust to this exclusion.
Speeding up NPI adoption by one day would have lowered the COVID-19 mortality rate by 2.2
percent. We next experiment with excluding the entire Northeast region of the country (column
5), as well as with focusing entirely on that region (column 6). As shown therein, the results
confirm our prior findings, underscoring the significance of NPIs in lowering mortality in the
18

National infection rates between January 1 and March 7, 2020 averaged 7.30 infections per 100,000. The pre-NPI
county average infection rate was 1.83 infections per 100,000.

Northeast. Specifically, speeding up the implementation of the NPIs by one day would have
lowered COVID-19 deaths by approximately 2 percent if we exclude the entire Northeast region.
However, in that region alone, deaths from COVID-19 would have dropped by 7.6 percent.
In sum, the analyses in Table 4 confirm the robustness of our estimates presented Table 2
to alternative definitions of a contagion outbreak, to the use of population weights, and to
changes to the geographic scope of our sample. 19

6.

Identification
An important caveat of the difference-in-difference approach adopted above refers to the

non-random adoption of NPIs. Given their implicit economic cost, counties are likely reticent to
impose social distancing, unless it is suspected that the health care system will be overwhelmed
as the death toll climbs. Luckily, from an inferential standpoint, if NPIs are implemented once
contagion has surpassed a threshold, the estimated impact of NPIs in curtailing COVID-related
deaths would likely represent a lower bound estimate of the true effectiveness of the adopted
measures if they were adopted in a timely manner. A related concern refers to endogeneity
biases stemming from unobserved heterogeneity. For instance, if the adoption of an NPI is
related to unobserved or unaccounted for factors, such as the county’s political ideology, which
may affect timely adoption of NPIs as well as cause laxity in the adoption of other measures,
including use of face masks or social distancing (Dave et al., 2020), the estimated impact of
NPIs might confound the impact of other unobserved factors.

19

This is also true if we distinguish between business closures and stay-at-home orders, as shown in Table A in the
appendix.

14

To address these endogeneity concerns, we conduct an event study. The latter allows us
to gauge if COVID-19 mortality trends already systematically differed across counties that
adopted NPIs earlier versus later, prior to the adoption of any NPI. In this manner, we address
concerns regarding pre-existing differential pre-trends across early- versus late-adopting
counties. Secondly, we are able to gauge if there is a clear break in the trend of COVID-19
mortality following the adoption of the NPIs. This enables us to dissipate concerns regarding the
confounding impact of unobserved and unaccounted for factors. Finally, we can examine the
dynamic impact of NPIs and assess if it makes sense based on how these policies reduce
infections and deaths. Specifically, we estimate the following model:
(2)

𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + ∑35
−35 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜌𝜌𝑐𝑐 + 𝜗𝜗𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

Equation (2) differs from equation (1) in that it includes leads and lags to the NPI
adoption timing, allowing us to examine the existence of pre-trends up to 35 days prior, as well
as dummies for up to 35 days after NPI adoption to learn about the impact of the implemented
policies. Figure 4 displays the coefficients from the event study corresponding to the most
complete model specification used in Table 2, along with 95 percent confidence intervals. All
estimates for the days preceding the adoption of the first NPI in the county are close to zero,
strongly supporting the assumption of no pre-trends. In addition, there is a clear break in the
trend in COVID-19 deaths approximately 4 weeks later—a common turn around period from
infection to recovery of most mild cases (Britt, 2020), staying down thereafter.
Another concern regarding identification refers to the start of social distancing, as well as
the observance of business closures and stay-at-home orders. If residents in early-adopting
counties were already practicing self-distancing prior to the adoption of an NPI, its estimated
effectiveness in curtailing deaths would be biased upwards. (The opposite would be the case if,

15

instead, that was predominantly the case among residents in counties that were late adopters of
NPIs—namely, the estimated impact of the NPI would be biased downwards). In addition, it is
important for the orders to have been observed by the public similarly across counties. If orders
were observed differentially in counties that were early- versus late-adopters, the estimated
impact of the NPI could also be biased. Fortunately, both concerns have been addressed by
recent research (e.g., Alexander and Karger, 2020) showing that county-level measures of
mobility declined sharply the day after stay-at-home orders went into effect, but not prior to their
implementation.

Furthermore, the authors find that responses to stay-at-home orders were

uniform across the country, and did not vary by income, political leanings, or urban/rural status.
Those findings reinforce the notion of no obvious self-distancing taking place prior to the
adoption of NPIs, as well as the obedient response to the mandated orders.

Mechanisms
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the COVID-19 virus is

primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets emitted during coughing or
sneezing and through fomites in the environment around the infected person. 20 By reducing
close contact between individuals, the adoption of NPIs, such as business closures and stay-athome orders, may slow down the COVID-19 virus transmission and, therefore, deaths. In the
absence of vaccines and reliable tracking systems, NPIs have also been invoked to flatten the
pandemic curve by lowering the demands on public healthcare services, allowing for COVID-19
patients to be properly treated (Ferguson et al., 2020). As such, NPIs could have helped lower
COVID-19 mortality directly by reducing contagion, as well as indirectly by preventing
bottlenecks in the healthcare system.
20

See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Spread.

16

As an attempt to sort out these two channels, we look first at COVID-19 infections. If the
effectiveness of the NPIs did not stem from reducing contagion but, rather, from avoiding an
overwhelmed healthcare system, we should not necessarily observe a reduction in the infection
rate. Yet, as displayed in columns (1) through (3) of Table 5, adopting one of the two types of
NPIs under examination one day earlier would have lowered infections by roughly 2 percent,
regardless of whether we use all counties, exclude New York or the entire Northeast region.
We then look at how the early versus late adoption of NPIs might have affected nonCOVID mortality. If NPIs primarily helped curtail pandemic deaths by preventing the healthcare
system from becoming overwhelmed, non-COVID mortality rates should also be lower in those
regions where the NPIs were adopted earlier, as non-COVID patients could still be treated.
Based on the results in columns (3) through (6) in Table 5, while negative, the estimated
coefficients are either marginally significant at the 10 percent level or not statistically different
from zero. In other words, the response speed does not significantly alter non-COVID deaths, as
one would expect if preventing congestion of the healthcare system was a primary channel for
the reduction in COVID-19 mortality following NPI adoption. Thus, our estimates suggest that
excess deaths from non-COVID causes observed in other studies (e.g. Woolf et al. 2020) during
the period of our study were not the by-product of the adoption speed of NPIs.
In sum, the results in Table 5 point to NPIs effectively reducing COVID-19 mortality by
curtailing contagion and the spread of the virus. These findings prove robust when we further
distinguish between business closures and stay-at-home orders, as displayed in Table B of the
appendix.
8.

Heterogeneous Impacts

17

To conclude, we examine if the relative adoption speed of NPIs impacted counties
differently based on other traits associated with either their adoption, or with the uneven impact
of the disease. Studies show that attitudes towards the efficacy of NPIs have been partisan, with
Republican governors and mayors being more reluctant to implement NPIs. It is also possible
that residents in majority-Republican counties with NPIs in place may be less compliant with
health care guidelines and recommendations. In Table 6, we first examine the differential impact
that the speed of NPI adoption had in Republican counties—measured as those with a
Republican vote share above 50 percent in the 2016 presidential election—given the role of
political partisan ideology in NPI adoption (Dave et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020). As can be
seen in column (1), adopting an NPI one day earlier lowers COVID-19 mortality in majorityRepublican counties by approximately 2.4 percent, whereas the reduction in other counties
reaches 5.4 percent. In other words, speeding up the implementation of NPIs in primarily
Republican counties would lower COVID-19 mortality by half the amount it would in nonRepublican counties. Why? Perhaps, NPIs are less strictly observed in Republican counties, in
which case, speeding up their implementation does not have the same bite as in other counties.
Note that descriptive statistics in Table 1 show that, according to our NPI speed measure,
Republican counties were more likely to be early adopters, largely on account of the late
outbreak of the pandemic in these counties.

Thus, our findings suggest that, despite the

advantage of learning from the experience of counties where the virus spread earlier, the NPIs
were less effective in these counties.
Finally, we consider how the NPI effectiveness might have varied according to various
county-level traits known to be correlated to COVID-19 mortality due to the high-incidence of
the disease among the elderly and individuals with poor health. To that end, we first explore if

18

the adoption speed of NPIs particularly benefits localities with a higher share of individuals age
65 and older. As shown in column (2) of Table 6, we do not find that to be the case, although the
differential impact is only marginally statistically different from zero. This could possibly be
because most COVID-related elderly fatalities were in nursing homes, where the two NPIs we
are investigating might not have been as effective in reducing contagion. Residents of nursing
homes would require other measures limiting their potential exposure to the virus, such as
restrictions of visitors or the safe distancing of residents from each other.
We then repeat the same exercise using other county-level traits reflective of the share of
the population that lack health insurance, are unemployed, or live below the federal poverty line.
We also look at the differential impact that speeding up the implementation of NPIs might have
in counties with higher comorbidity indexes. As shown in columns (3) through (6) in Table 6,
speeding up the implementation of NPIs does not appear to affect the death rate for COVID-19
any differently in counties with higher versus lower values of the abovementioned traits. To
some degree, this is not surprising given the aggregated nature of those traits. As such, the nonsignificance of those demographic traits should be interpreted with caution.

Summary and Conclusions
The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by surprise. In the absence

of a vaccine, and to halt the devastating impact of the pandemic on lives, several countries opted
for the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The United States was no different
in that regard, even though the response has been more fragmented and piecemeal.

Prior

research has shown the effectiveness of NPIs in curtailing deaths in the United States, Europe
and Asia. Our focus is on the importance of their timeliness, the mechanisms behind it, and the

19

heterogeneity of any effectiveness depending on the political ideology and degree of
vulnerability of counties.
Using county-level data on COVID-19 mortality and infections, along with county-level
information on the adoption of stay-at-home orders and business closures, we examine how the
adoption speed of NPIs has affected COVID-19 mortality.

We find that moving up the

implementation date of NPIs by one day lowers the COVID-19 death rate by 2.4 percent. The
effectiveness of acting early is similar for both stay-at-home orders and business closures. An
event study addresses concerns regarding the endogeneity of NPI adoption, and robustness
checks show the results persist when introducing controls for testing and mobility, altering the
definition of adoption speed, weighting counties by population size, and considering different
geographic scopes. Finally, we confirm how the relevance of responding early stems from the
ability to slow contagion, which likely prevented the overburdening of the healthcare system.
We also find that NPI adoption speed has less relevance in Republican counties—a possible
byproduct of skepticism and reluctance to apply or fully comply with NPIs. In contrast, NPIs
appear similarly effective, and their speed of implementation equally as relevant, in counties
with distinct degrees of vulnerability to the disease, as captured by an index of comorbidity and
the share of residents without health insurance, unemployed, or living in poverty.
While we await anxiously a vaccine or cure, NPIs remain the main mechanism to curtail
COVID-19 deaths. Gaining a better understanding of their timeliness and the importance of
responding early is essential, especially in the foreseeable occurrence of additional waves.

Notes: Statistics are reported at the county-level unless otherwise specified. These estimates are not weighted by population. Counties that never adopted an
NPI during our study period were assigned an uninformative NPI speed value to ensure these cases were preserved when estimating the model outlined in Eq. 1.
Our specification interacts NPI speed with a dummy indicative of the day a county adopted an NPI—effectively rendering this value zero for never adopters.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. All regressions include a constant term. Standard errors are in parentheses and clustered at the county level.
Observations vary across specifications due to missing data. Column (1) uses information from 3,089 because 28 were missing information on election returns.
Columns (3), (4), and (5) use information from 3,116 counties because one county was missing information on the number of residents without health insurance,
unemployed, or living below the federal poverty line.

Notes: Early adopters include counties with safer at home and/or business closure policies in
place prior to the first day-to-day doubling of infections per capita. Late adopters include
counties that adopted an NPI after the first day-to-day infection doubling. Never adopters
include counties that did not have a safer at home or business closure policy in place anytime
between February 15, 2020 and April 23, 2020.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. All regressions include a constant term. Standard errors are in parentheses and clustered at the county level. This table
reports the estimates from Equation (1) using daily COVID-19 deaths occurring between February 15, 2020 and April 23, 2020. In columns (1) and (2), we alter the
definition of contagion we used to measure the speed of adoption of safer-at-home orders (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 ) and non-essential business closures (𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑐𝑐 ). Specifically, we
replace our original contagion threshold, which reflected the first day-to-day doubling of infections per capita in a given county to (1) the first day infections per
capita exceeded the national average from January 21, 2020 to March 7, 2020 and (2) the county average infections per capita prior to NPI adoption, the results of
which are found in columns (1) and (2), respectively. In column (3), we apply population weights to derive nationally representative estimates. In columns (4), (5),
and (6), we experiment with using alternative samples to estimate Eq. (1). In column (4), we exclude New York from the analysis. In column (5), we exclude the
entire Northeast region, which consists of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.
In column (6), we focus exclusively on the Northeast region.
