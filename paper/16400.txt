ABSTRACT
We quantify the role of financial frictions and the initial misallocation of resources in explaining development
dynamics. Following a reform that triggers efficient reallocation of resources, our model economy
with financial frictions converges slowly to the new steady state—it takes twice as long to cover half
the distance to the steady state as the neoclassical growth model. Investment rates and total factor productivity
start out low and rise over time. These model dynamics are endogenously determined by the extent
of initial resource misallocation and the degree of financial frictions. We present data from post-war
miracle economies on the evolution of macro aggregates, factor reallocation, and establishment size
distribution, which support the aggregate and micro-level implications of our theory.

The development dynamics of post-war miracle economies are characterized by a sustained growth of per-capita income and total factor productivity (TFP), and investment
rates that rose over time.
These growth facts are not explained by standard growth models. In the neoclassical
model, such transitions can only be understood as a transition from an initial state with
low capital stock to a steady state with high capital stock. This transition is characterized
by a fast convergence—even the economic miracles seem three times slower when compared
to a conventionally-calibrated neoclassical model—and investment rates that monotonically
decrease throughout. Furthermore, for a neoclassical model, TFP is an exogenously given
input, and hence it offers no insight into TFP dynamics.
The objective of our paper is to provide a theory of TFP dynamics and build upon it a
quantitative framework for understanding the process of economic development.
To this end, we incorporate into the standard growth model two important features of
the economic miracles. First, their growth accelerations followed large and broad economic
reforms that reduced distortions in the economy and led to reallocation of resources across
sectors and plants, as we empirically establish in this paper. Second, the miracle economies’
financial markets remained largely underdeveloped until the latter stages of their economic
transitions, as evidenced by their low ratios of external finance to gross domestic product
(GDP).
In our model, transition dynamics are endogenously determined by the extent of resource
misallocation in the pre-reform economy and the degree of imperfections in financial markets.
Our model generates persistent growth in per-capita output and TFP, and investment rates
that start low but rise over time. In particular, its transition speed is half that of the
conventionally-calibrated neoclassical model.
To be more specific, we incorporate individual-specific technology—entrepreneurship—
and financial frictions into an otherwise-standard neoclassical model. In our model, individuals differ in their entrepreneurial productivity and choose each period whether to be an
entrepreneur and operate his technology or to supply labor for wage. This occupation choice
allows for endogenous entry into and exit from the production sector, which are important
channels of resource reallocation. We model financial frictions in the form of collateral constraints arising from imperfect enforceability of contracts. Financial frictions not only distort
the allocation of production factors (capital and entrepreneurial talents) but also slow down
their reallocation process.
Motivated by the historical accounts of the miracle economies, we model the growth
acceleration episodes as a process triggered by a large-scale economic reform that removes
important sources of resource misallocation. We operationalize this idea by building upon
2

the recent literature that emphasizes the role of idiosyncratic distortions/wedges (Restuccia
and Rogerson, 2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Bartelsman et al., 2009). In particular, our
pre-reform economy is the steady state of an economy subject to an exogenous process of
idiosyncratic taxes and subsidies that distort individuals’ production decisions. The largescale reform is then a once-and-for-all elimination of all such taxes and subsidies. We do
not view these idiosyncratic distortions literally as taxes and subsidies. Rather, they are
a parsimonious and transparent means of modeling individual/sector/size-specific policies,
regulations, trade restrictions, and entry barriers that distort the allocation of resources
across sectors and production units. We also note from the historical accounts that these
reforms were implemented with underdeveloped financial markets in the background.
We quantitatively discipline our model in two steps. First, we calibrate the parameters
that are invariant across countries and over time in a way that our undistorted, perfectcredit model economy matches the US data on standard macroeconomic aggregates, the
size distribution of establishments and their dynamics. Second, as for the reform-related
parameters, the degree of an economy’s financial frictions is calibrated to the data on external
finance to GDP ratios. The extent of the pre-reform idiosyncratic distortions is chosen to
match the level changes in TFP and capital-to-output ratios between the reform date and
the twentieth post-reform year. We then use our model to identify and quantify the role of
initial resource misallocation and financial frictions in explaining the actual time paths of
TFP and capital deepening over the same 20-year period in the miracle economies.
Our main exercise analyzes the transitional dynamics triggered by a sudden, unexpected
reform that eliminates idiosyncratic distortions, with financial frictions remaining intact.
This stark exercise is designed to highlight the transition dynamics that are wholly endogenous and intrinsic to the model. The model transition has three important features. First,
the transition is gradual. Following the reform, GDP grows at an annualized rate of 3.7
percent for 16 years, and it takes 10.5 years for the capital stock to cover half the distance
to the new, post-reform steady state—almost twice as long as the comparably-calibrated
neoclassical transition. Second, the model generates endogenous dynamics of TFP, which
increases by 4.9 percent per year for 7 years, although there is no further exogenous change
after the reform. Third, the investment-to-output ratio rises over time, peaking 8 years after the reform. These rich dynamics reflect the process of unwinding much of the resource
misallocation in the pre-reform economy that is slowed down by the frictions in financial
markets.
In the pre-reform economy, resources are misallocated partly because of the financial
frictions, but also because of idiosyncratic distortions: Subsidized entrepreneurs run larger
operations and have more income and wealth than does their true productivity warrant,
3

while the opposite is true for taxed entrepreneurs. The reform initiates a process of massive
resource reallocation, but the underdeveloped financial market acts as a bottleneck: It takes
time for productive-but-poor entrepreneurs to save up the collateral needed for starting a
business and then operating at the efficient scale. This gradual reallocation—the entry and
expansion of productive entrepreneurs and the downsizing and exit of incompetent ones losing
subsidy—manifests itself in the slow pace of the transition overall, and more important, in
the persistent TFP dynamics.
The investment rate dynamics are also explained by the gradual reallocation. Productivebut-poor entrepreneurs must save up enough collateral for entry and expansion, and have
high saving rates. Those who lose subsidy are downsizing and exiting, and have much lower
saving rates. Because of the idiosyncratic distortions in the pre-reform economy, the former
account for only a small share of the aggregate wealth and income, while the latter, along
with workers who also have low saving rates, account for a large share. The aggregate saving
rate—equal to the investment rate in a closed economy—is an income-weighted average of
the two groups’ saving rates, and hence starts out low. Over time, those with high saving
rates account for more and more wealth and therefore income, and the aggregate saving rate
increases.
In subsequent exercises, we show that the transition dynamics we obtain require both
frictions in financial markets and a reform that removes some sources of distortions. First,
with perfect financial markets, the model is isomorphic to the neoclassical model, and a
reform can only result in neoclassical dynamics. Intuitively, the reallocation process is
instantaneous with perfect financial markets, and the initial misallocation has no lasting
impact (Section 3.3.1). On the other hand, if the transition is triggered not by the removal
of distortions but by a proportional improvement in production technology, the transition
dynamics are very similar to the neoclassical dynamics, even in the presence of severe financial
frictions. This is because there is no reallocation of resources to be done along the transition
(Section 3.3.2).
In our exercises, in order to highlight the endogenous dynamics of the model, we drastically simplify actual reform episodes, which tended to be more protracted affairs and even
prone to temporary reversals. Moreover, while financial market reforms were implemented
much later and even more gradually than the removal of individual/sector/size-specific distortions, financial markets did improve over time.1 Our framework can easily incorporate
1

Measured in both de jure and de facto sense, domestic financial market reforms lagged behind the removal
of size-dependent or industry-specific distortions. Indeed, in policy circles, the removal of idiosyncratic
distortions are categorized as “first-generation” reforms, while domestic financial markets are considered to
fall into the domain of “second-generation” reforms, which comprise institutional reforms aimed at enhancing
transparency and good governance in financial markets and corporate sectors (Camdessus, 1999; Navia and

4

these facts, and indeed we consider a gradual financial development calibrated to the evolution of external finance to GDP in the data. Our results are found to be further strengthened
(Section 3.3.3). With financial development, the financial markets are at its worst exactly
when there is the most misallocation (i.e., at the beginning of the transition), and our gradual reallocation mechanism plays an even bigger role early on. Furthermore, the continued
financial development in the latter stages of transitions results in even more persistent growth
in GDP, TFP, and investment rates.
Our model provides a quantitative analysis of the macroeconomic dynamics following
large-scale reforms. At the same time, the rich microeconomic heterogeneity in our model
yields some salient micro-level implications that can be confronted with available data. In
particular, the model predicts a spike in the reallocation of resources after the reform and a
gradual increase in the size of the average establishment along the transition. We gather and
compile available data and present evidence that supports our model in these dimensions
(Section 4).
Related Literature Our study of the development dynamics of miracle economies relates
to a recent literature on growth accelerations (Pritchett, 2000; Hausmann et al., 2005; Jones
and Olken, 2008). Works in this literature use statistical techniques to identify structural
breaks in growth series, and document the variables that correlate with growth accelerations.
Large-scale economic reforms, as measured by Sachs and Warner (1995), are statistically
significant predictors of sustained growth accelerations. Furthermore, consistent with our
findings, the literature shows that the earlier stages of growth accelerations are driven by
TFP growth that partly reflects more efficient labor reallocation, with capital accumulation
playing a relatively minor role (Jones and Olken, 2005). We complement this literature
with an in-depth study of 7 post-war miracle episodes, all of which are identified as incidents of sustained growth accelerations by the literature. We document that these growth
accelerations follow large-scale reforms. We then quantitatively analyze the role of resource
reallocation and financial development, and also present further empirical evidence on the
reallocation of resources across sectors and plants following the reforms.
Christiano (1989) and King and Rebelo (1993) point out that the neoclassical transition
dynamics are inconsistent with the observed growth experiences of economic miracles. They
also study whether modified versions of the neoclassical growth model can account for the
observed dynamics. The modifications include non-homothetic preferences, adjustment costs
and a broader notion of capital, but all of them lead to some counterfactual implications for
investment rates, interest rates and/or relative prices of installed capital and new investment
Velasco, 2003).

goods. More recently, Chen et al. (2006) reconcile the neoclassical growth model with the
post-war growth experience of Japan. They feed into the neoclassical model the realizations
of the measured TFP path as an exogenous process, and show that the resulting dynamics
are consistent with the data. In this context, we view our paper as an attempt at providing a
theory of the TFP dynamics along the transitional paths based on the interaction of financial
frictions and the initial misallocation of resources.
More recently, the disappointing growth experiences of post-communist countries have
motivated many researchers to study economic transitions. This literature focuses on the
reallocation of factors from state to private enterprises, with a particular emphasis on worker
flows and labor market frictions (Blanchard, 1997). Our contention is that capital and
entrepreneurial talents were inefficiently aligned during the communist era, and that financial
frictions delayed efficient reallocation of capital even after the liberalization.2 Atkeson and
Kehoe (1997) also attribute the delayed transition of these economies to misallocation of
capital. In their model, capital cannot be swiftly reallocated across firms because it takes
time for new private firms to accumulate complementary organizational capital.
We are building on the theoretical literature that counts financial frictions as a central
issue on economic development—see Banerjee and Duflo (2005) for an exhaustive review
of this literature. We develop this idea in ways that are empirically useful, by studying
the transitional dynamics and the stationary equilibria of a broader class of quantitativelyoriented models with financial frictions. Giné and Townsend (2004) and Jeong and Townsend
(2008, 2007) have pioneered quantitative analysis for this class of models. They estimate
and calibrate models in this literature to the growth experience of Thailand. We share their
interest in studying the role of financial frictions on transitional dynamics. However, in our
main exercise we abstract from financial deepening which is the main driving force of their
transition dynamics. Instead, we emphasize how, after reforms that eliminate important
sources of misallocation, the joint distribution of ability and wealth evolves endogenously
over time under financial frictions, starting from an initial condition characterized by resource
misallocation.3
2

In the communist economies, the allocation of capital was as likely to be determined by the distribution
of power as by productivity. See Blanchard (1997) and Roland (2000) and the references therein. Calvo and
Coricelli (1992) argue that credit market frictions inhibited efficient reallocation of capital in Poland after
the liberalization.
3
More specifically, our model incorporates forward-looking saving decisions and heterogeneity in returns
to capital across entrepreneurs, both of which they abstract from.

Motivating Facts

We present 5 common characteristics of the so-called development miracles. First, in most
of these economies, economic growth took off following large-scale, economy-wide reforms.
Second, even the miracles are protracted affairs, taking several decades to catch up with
the richest economies. Third, a significant fraction of the economic growth is explained
by the sustained growth in TFP. Fourth, the investment-to-output ratios are hump-shaped,
increasing in the early stages of the growth acceleration and falling in the latter phases.
Finally, these economies’ financial markets have remained underdeveloped for the better
part of the transitions.
To be more specific, we document the aggregate development dynamics of China, Japan,
Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. These economies belong to the top
decile in average growth rates during the 1960–2000 period. Furthermore, for each of these
economies, one finds a large-scale economic reform that marks the beginning of the growth
acceleration.4
Large-Scale Reforms Our perusal of the complex histories of the 7 countries and their
reforms has led to the following reform dates: China, 1992; Japan, 1949; Korea, 1961;
Malaysia, 1968; Singapore, 1967; Taiwan, 1959; and Thailand, 1983. We have also tried
a purely statistical procedure to identify the beginning of growth accelerations following
Hausmann et al. (2005) and Jones and Olken (2008), and we obtained strikingly similar
dates. In fact, Hausmann et al. confirm that the beginning of many such acceleration
episodes coincides with large-scale economic reforms. We proceed with our event-based
approach because it allows us to be more explicit about the underlying events and policies
that led to growth accelerations. In the appendix we provide a summary of these reform
episodes for each country.
All the reforms that we identified above entailed large and broad changes in the economic structure. While each reform episode has idiosyncratic characteristics, these reforms
involve the dismantling of import substitution regimes, the introduction of export-oriented
policies (e.g., broadly-applied tax and credit advantages for exporters that did not distort
the relative prices of tradables in the world market), and a substantial retrenchment of the
4

The other economies in the top decile are Hong Kong, Ireland, and Romania, which we exclude from our
analysis. For Hong Kong we could not identify large-scale reforms that can be used to date the beginning
of their growth accelerations. Romania is not included because it was a non-market economy until the early
1990s, and also because its data exhibit erratic patterns. In the case of Ireland, its economic transformation
followed the reforms in the late 1980s and the early 1990s that substantially liberalized local financial markets
and international capital flows. In this regard, the Irish experience is sufficiently different from the others,
and is not considered here. Having said so, our framework can be easily extended to accommodate such
financial market reforms and capital account liberalizations, as is demonstrated in Sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.

government’s intervention in the economy. Another common component is the promotion of
private firms’ entry through a variety of measures, such as the deregulation of labor markets
and the simplification of tax codes. In essence, the reforms resulted in more market-oriented
economies, leading more productive firms and sectors to expand, and unproductive ones to
contract. Naturally, such findings, together with more quantitative evidence on resource reallocation discussed in Section 4, have guided us in modeling large-scale reform episodes: We
think of the pre-reform state as an economy stricken by idiosyncratic distortions or static
wedges—as in Restuccia and Rogerson (2008)—and model a reform as the elimination of
these idiosyncratic distortions that triggers macroeconomic transitions.

Post-Reform Transition Dynamics Figure 1 presents the main features of these economic miracles. The unweighted average across the 7 economies are shown with a thick gray
line.5 For a given economy, year 0 on the horizontal axis is its date of large-scale reforms,
and hence the beginning of its economic transition. A point on the horizontal axis therefore
corresponds to different calendar years for different countries. The top left panel shows the
evolution of the per-capita output in each country relative to the US value in each period.
5

We deal with the unbalanced nature of our panel in the following way. First, we calculate the unweighted
average for the balanced part of the panel. We then extrapolate this series forward and backward using the
average growth rate of the countries with available data for given years.

8

All these economies exhibit large and persistent output gains, which appear slow when
seen through the lens of the neoclassical growth theory. A reasonably-calibrated neoclassical
model—a capital share of one-third, a discount factor of 0.96, an intertemporal elasticity of
substitution of 0.67, and a depreciation rate of 0.06—predicts that it should take less than
6 years for aggregate capital stock to cover half the distance to the steady state. The data
suggest a half-life of at least 15 years.6
As shown in the bottom left panel, a significant fraction of the output gains is explained by productivity gains. Note that the standard neoclassical model—where TFP is an
exogenously-given process—has nothing to say about the TFP dynamics.7
The top right panel depicts the behavior of investment-to-output ratios. In a neoclassical
model, the investment-to-output ratios are monotonically decreasing along the transition to
a steady state. In the data, investment rates actually start low and rise in the early stages
of transitions. Only in the latter stages of transitions, are investment rates decreasing as
predicted by the standard theory.
Finally, as shown in the bottom right panel, these economies are characterized by low
levels of financial development as measured by the ratio of external finance to GDP. Our
external finance measure is the sum of private credit owed to depository and other financial
institutions as reported in Beck et al. (2000). For comparison, the average of this ratio for the
US during the 1990–2005 period is 1.75 (dashed line). From the evolution of this indicator,
one can see that financial development is achieved only in the latter phases of transitions.
The average across countries of the external finance to GDP ratio during the first 20 years
of transitions is less than 0.6.8
We now construct a model with financial market imperfections and resource misallocation
that captures and explains the observed growth experiences.
6

To calculate the half-life in the data, we need to first take a stand on the long-run value of capital. We
define it as the average over years 35 through 40 after the reforms. In this period, the per-worker capital
relative to the US was stagnant on average, growing at an annual rate lower than 0.5 percent.
7
TFP for each country is relative to the US value in each period. We net out the contribution of
human capital in our TFP construction. We measure human capital using a standard Mincerian framework,
assuming a return of 13.4 percent per year for the first 4 years of schooling, 10.1 percent for the next 4 years,
and 6.8 percent for the years thereafter. See, for example, Bernanke and Gürkaynak (2001). Capital stock
series are constructed using the perpetual inventory method and an initial steady state assumption. We use
a capital share of one-third. The data on GDP, investment rate, and the size of the workforce are from the
Penn World Table 6.3.
8
One exception is Thailand, which reformed its financial sector earlier than did other economies
(Townsend, 2010). The sharp reversal around year 15 in the Thai series coincides with the 1997 financial crisis.

Model

We propose a model with individual-specific technologies and imperfect financial markets to
study the role of misallocation and reallocation of resources in macroeconomic transitions.
In each period, individuals choose either to operate an individual-specific technology—
i.e., to become entrepreneurs—or to work for wage. This occupation choice allows for endogenous entry and exit in and out of the production sector, which are an important channel
of resource allocation. Individuals are heterogeneous with respect to their entrepreneurial
ability and wealth. Our model generates endogenous dynamics for the ability-wealth distribution, which turns out to be crucial for understanding macroeconomic transitions.
Imperfection in financial markets is modeled with a collateral constraint on capital rental
that is proportional to an individual’s financial wealth. This rental limit applies equally to
all individuals in the economy.
In this section, we do not consider idiosyncratic distortions (or wedges). We introduce
them into our model in Section 3.1.2 to construct the pre-reform economy.
Heterogeneity and Demographics Individuals live indefinitely, and are heterogeneous
with respect to their wealth a and their entrepreneurial ability e ∈ E, with the former being
chosen endogenously by forward-looking saving decisions. An individual’s ability follows a
stochastic process. In particular, individuals retain their ability from one period to the next
with probability ψ. With probability 1 − ψ, an individual loses the current ability and draws
a new entrepreneurial ability. The new draw is from a time-invariant ability distribution,
and is independent of one’s previous ability level. One can think of the ability shock as an
arrival of a new technology making existing production processes obsolete or less profitable.
In Section 3.1 we will calibrate this shock to be of a relatively low frequency—an average
duration of ten years—to match the rate of establishment turnovers in the US data.
We denote by µ (e) the mass of type-e individuals in the invariant distribution, with
e being assumed to be a discrete random variable. We denote by Gt (e, a) the cumulative

Technology In any given period, individuals can choose either to work for wage or to
operate an individual-specific technology. We label the latter option as entrepreneurship.
We assume that an entrepreneur with talent e who uses k units of capital and hires l units of
labor produces according to a production function f (e, k, l), which is assumed to be strictly
increasing in all arguments, and strictly concave in capital and labor, with f (0, k, l) = 0. To
be more specific, we use
f (e, k, l) = e k α l1−α

,

(1)

where 1 − ν is the span-of-control parameter. Accordingly, 1 − ν represents the share of
output going to the variable factors. Out of this, fraction α goes to capital, and 1 − α goes
to labor.
Throughout the paper, we assume that entrepreneurial ability is inalienable and that
there is no market for entrepreneurial talents (potentially because of severe agency problems
that we do not model explicitly). The labor market for workers is assumed to be perfectly
competitive and frictionless. We now turn to the capital rental market, which is subject to
contract enforcement problems.
Financial Markets Productive capital is the only asset in the economy. There is a
perfectly-competitive financial intermediary that receives deposits, and rents out capital
to entrepreneurs. The return on deposited assets—i.e., the interest rate in the economy—is
rt . The zero-profit condition of the intermediary implies that the rental price of capital is
rt + δ, where δ is the depreciation rate.
We assume that entrepreneurs’ capital rental k is limited by a collateral constraint k ≤ λa,
where a ≥ 0 is individual financial wealth and λ measures the degree of credit frictions, with
λ = ∞ corresponding to perfect credit markets and λ = 1 to financial autarky where all
capital has to be self-financed by entrepreneurs. The same λ applies to everyone in a given
economy.
Our specification captures the common prediction from models of limited contract enforcement: The amount of credit is limited by individuals’ wealth. At the same time, its
parsimoniousness—the fact that financial frictions are captured by one single parameter, λ—
enables us to analyze the quantitative effects of financial frictions on aggregate transitional

11

dynamics without losing tractability.9
In this paper, we focus on within-period credit, or capital rental, for production purposes,
and do not allow borrowing for intertemporal consumption smoothing; i.e., a ≥ 0. This
constraint will only bind for individuals who choose to be workers, and has no direct bearing
on the behavior of entrepreneurs, who will need to hold assets to overcome the collateral
constraint.

l,k≤λa

Note that the collateral constraint k ≤ λa is taken into account. Similarly, we denote the
input demand functions by l (a; e, w, r) and k (a; e, w, r).
The max operator in the budget constraint stands for the occupation choice. A typee individual with current wealth a will choose to be an entrepreneur if his profit as an
entrepreneur, π(a; e, w, r), exceeds labor income as a wage earner, w. This occupational
choice can be represented by a simple policy function. Type-e individuals decide to be
entrepreneurs if their current wealth a is higher than the threshold wealth a (e), where a (e)
solves:
π (a (e) ; e, w, r) = w.
Intuitively, individuals of a given ability choose to become entrepreneurs only if they are
wealthy enough to overcome the collateral constraint and run their businesses at a profitable
9

Our collateral constraint can be derived from the following limited enforcement problem. Consider an
individual with financial wealth a ≥ 0 deposited in the financial intermediary at the beginning of a period.
Assume that he rents k units of capital. Then he can abscond with fraction 1/λ of the rented capital. The
only punishment is that he will lose his financial wealth a deposited in the intermediary. In particular, he
will not be excluded from any economic activity in the future: He is even allowed to instantaneously deposit
the stolen capital k/λ and continue on as a worker or an entrepreneur. In the equilibrium, the financial
intermediary will rent capital only to the extent that no individual will renege on the rental contract:
k/λ ≤ a.

scale. Similarly, individuals of a given wealth level choose to become entrepreneurs only if
their ability is high enough.10
With perfect credit markets, an individual’s occupation depends solely on his ability and
not on his wealth. There will be a threshold level of e such that those with higher ability
become entrepreneurs and the rest become workers. We provide more detail below.

our model aggregates. This aggregate production function reflects the optimal allocation
of individuals to entrepreneurship and of capital and labor to active entrepreneurs. In the
absence of collateral constraints, individuals’ wealth are irrelevant for production decisions.

Here A(µ) embodies the effect of the distribution of entrepreneurial ability on aggregate
output. The threshold level for entrepreneurship is em . Given that we are assuming a
discrete distribution of e, the choice of ι allows for the possibility that it may be optimal to
assign only a fraction of the marginal ability types to entrepreneurship.
10

Obviously, an individual’s e may be so low that he will never choose to be an entrepreneur. In this case,
a should be thought of as ∞.

Quantitative Analysis

The central objective of this paper is to construct a quantitative model of economic development that can capture and explain the rich macroeconomic transition dynamics observed
in the data. Motivated by the historical accounts of the 7 miracle economies, we model
the transition dynamics as a process triggered by a large-scale economic reform eliminating
important sources of resource misallocation in the economy. We operationalize this idea by
building on the recent literature that emphasizes the role of idiosyncratic distortions (or
wedges) (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Bartelsman et al., 2009).
In particular, our pre-reform state is the steady state of an economy where individuals are
subject to an exogenous process of idiosyncratic taxes and subsidies. We then model the
large-scale reform as a once-and-for-all elimination of all such taxes and subsidies. We emphasize that these idiosyncratic taxes and subsidies are merely a means of generating the
pre-reform state in a disciplined and transparent manner. They stand in for the industrial
policies, protectionism, entry barriers, sector- and/or size-dependent policies, a web of onerous and often-contradictory regulations, to name but a few, that have hindered economic
development for many years. They are not meant to be literally taken as taxes and subsidies. We also note from the historical accounts that these reforms were implemented with
underdeveloped financial markets in the background.

3.1

Calibration

In order to quantify our theory, we first calibrate a set of structural parameters—preferences,
technologies, distribution of entrepreneurial ability—that remain invariant throughout. Then
we calibrate a set of parameters that may change over the course of transitions—parameters
governing idiosyncratic distortions and financial frictions. Once all these parameters are chosen, we use our model to construct the initial condition for our transition exercises, G0 (e, a).
This initial condition is the joint ability-wealth distribution in a stationary equilibrium with
idiosyncratic distortions and underdeveloped financial markets.
3.1.1

Parameters Invariant across Time and Economies

The entrepreneurial ability e is assumed to be a truncated and discretized version of a Pareto
distribution whose probability density is ηe−(η+1) for e ≥ 1. Each period, an individual
retains his previous entrepreneurial ability with probability ψ. With probability 1 − ψ, he
draws a new ability realization from the distribution of e given above. Obviously, ψ controls
the persistence of ability, while η determines the dispersion of ability in the population.
We here determine seven parameter values: two technological parameters, α and ν;
14

depreciation rate δ; two parameters describing the ability process, ψ and η; relative risk
aversion coefficient σ, and subjective discount factor β.11
We let σ = 1.5 following the standard practice. The one-year depreciation rate is set
at δ = 0.06. We choose α = 0.33. We are thus left with three relatively non-standard
parameters, ν, η, ψ, and the subjective discount factor, β. We calibrate them using as
many relevant moments in the US data. They are: the employment share of the top decile of
establishments by size; the share of earnings generated by the top twentieth of the population;
the exit rate of establishments; and the real interest rate.
To be more specific, we calibrate our model with perfect capital markets (λ = ∞) to
match these moments in the US. We allow for the possibility that the average entrepreneurial
productivity in the US is higher than in less developed economies, reflecting human capital
and exogenous aggregate productivity differences.12 As the primary mechanism of our model
concerns the allocation of resources among heterogeneous producers, our calibration and
results are not affected by such cross-country differences in the mean level of entrepreneurial
productivity.13
In mapping our model to the data, establishments are our preferred unit of analysis
because we think they embody production technologies. Our explicit assumption is that
one entrepreneurial operation in the model is an establishment in the data. Under our
assumption that the US is the perfect-credit benchmark, our model is consistent with the
presence of firms with multiple establishments in the data, because the firm-establishment
correspondence does not affect the production side of the economy at all—in particular the
establishment size distribution—with perfect credit markets.
The first column of Table 1 shows the moments in the US data. The decile with the
largest—measured by employment—establishments in the US accounts for 67 per cent of
the total employment in 2000. We target the earnings share of the top twentieth of the
population (0.3 in 1998), and an annual establishment exit rate of 10 percent reported in
the US Census Business Dynamics Statistics. Finally, as the target interest rate, we pick 4.5

Recall that the entrepreneurial production technology is e k α l1−α

12
That is, for the US, one can use the following production function with AUS > 1:

13

One can consider introducing exogenous differences across countries in the higher-order moments of the
entrepreneurial ability distribution. The difficulty here is that the available data do not provide enough
guidance or discipline on the direction and magnitude of cross-country variations in these moments. Even
without such exogenous differences in the higher-order moments of the underlying entrepreneurial ability
distribution, however, our model endogenously generates different distributions of productivity among active
entrepreneurs for economies with different degrees of financial frictions or idiosyncratic distortions.

The second column of Table 1 shows the moments simulated from the calibrated model.
Even though in the model economy all four moments are jointly determined by the four
parameters, each moment is primarily affected by one particular parameter. Given the spanof-control parameter 1 − ν, the tail parameter of the talent distribution η can be inferred
from the tail of the employment distribution. We can then infer ν from the earnings share
of the top five percent of the population. Top earners are mostly entrepreneurs both in
the data and in our model, and ν controls the share of output going to the entrepreneurial
input. These two parameters are calibrated at ν = 0.21 and η = 4.15. The parameter
ψ = 0.894 leads to an annual exit rate of 10 percent in the model. Note that 1 − ψ is larger
than 0.1, because a fraction of those hit by the idea shock chooses to remain in business.
Entrepreneurs exit only if their newly-drawn ability is below the equilibrium cutoff level.
Finally, the model requires a discount factor of β = 0.904 to attain an interest rate of 4.5
percent per year.
3.1.2

Parameters for Idiosyncratic Distortions and Financial Frictions

We model the initial condition of our transition exercises as the joint ability-wealth distribution in a stationary equilibrium under financial frictions and idiosyncratic distortions. We
model the latter as individual-specific (or idiosyncratic) taxes/subsidies/wedges on output
τyi that distort the static profit-maximization problem of entrepreneur i into:
(1 − τyi ) ei kiα li1−α

1−ν

− wli − (δ + r) ki ,

ki ≤ λai .

The important distinction is that our financial frictions apply equally to everyone in the
economy—λ has no individual subscript—while τyi is individual specific, as the explicit
index i emphasizes. We could alternatively assume that idiosyncratic distortions take the
form of taxes/subsidies on capital or labor, and still obtain similar results.
We reiterate here that τyi ’s are merely a transparent and parsimonious means of operationalizing the pre-reform distortions and their removal through a reform. We do not have
16

to view them literally as taxes or subsidies.14
For the sake of parsimoniousness, we assume that τy is a random variable with only two
possible outcomes: τ+ (≥ 0) and τ− (≤ 0). Also, the probability of being taxed for a type-e
individual, Pr{τy = τ+ |e}, is assumed to be 1 − e−qe . The literature—e.g., Restuccia and
Rogerson (2008)—shows that such idiosyncratic distortions have larger adverse effects when
τy and e are positively correlated, which in our parametrization requires q > 0—because τ+
and τ− are the same for all e.
Now we have 3 parameters, τ+ , τ− , and q, which are then chosen to match the following
three moments. First, measured TFP relative to the US increased by one-third after 20
years of post-reform transitions, when averaged across the 7 transition episodes we study in
Section 1. Second, the capital-to-output ratios increased by 37 percent over the same 20-year
span.15 Finally, we impose budget balance on the pre-reform stationary equilibrium. While
we do not think of the idiosyncratic distortions literally as taxes and subsidies, we find that
this assumption gives us a sensible benchmark. In the end, we have τ+ = 0.57, τ− = −0.15,
and q = 1.55.
As for the financial friction parameter, we pick λ = 1.35, which corresponds to a steadystate external finance to GDP ratio of 0.6 in an economy without idiosyncratic distortions,
which is the time average of the cross-country average series over the period that begins
5 years before and ends 25 years after the reforms in Section 1. In Section 3.3.3, we also
consider a gradual financial development (i.e., a sequence of λ’s that increases over time)
that matches the evolution of the external finance to GDP ratios in the data.
We now compute the stationary equilibrium with idiosyncratic distortions and financial
frictions. The resulting joint distribution of wealth and ability is the initial condition of
our benchmark transition exercises in Section 3.3.1. This joint distribution is characterized by wealth being misallocated across ability types, when compared with the stationary
distribution of an economy without idiosyncratic distortions.

3.2

Long-Run Impact of Financial Frictions

We first show the long-run effect of financial frictions on the equilibrium output, aggregate
productivity, and interest rate. We vary λ—the parameter governing the enforcement of
contracts—from 1 (financial autarky) to ∞ (perfect credit), which span external finance to
GDP ratios from 0 to 1.74. This is the empirically relevant range: In Beck et al. (2000),
14

One interpretation is that the returns to entrepreneurial abilities are distorted idiosyncratically by
government policies and interventions. The retreat of the government can then be thought of as the reduction
or removal of τyi ’s, which re-aligns the returns to entrepreneurial abilities.
15
The idea is that we fix the magnitude of long-run changes in TFP and capital-output ratios, and evaluate
the speed and the shape of the model transition dynamics.

17

the bottom quartile of the cross-country distribution of external finance to GDP ratios is
0.13, while the figure for the US, one of the most financially developed economies, is 1.75.
The parameter λ itself has no immediate empirical counterpart. Hence we plot our model
simulations against the endogenous ratio of external finance to GDP implied by a given λ.
The equilibrium external finance to GDP ratio is monotonically increasing in λ, with a lower
λ corresponding to more financial frictions.
There are no idiosyncratic distortions in this analysis, as we focus on the marginal effect
of financial frictions.

Fig. 2: Long-Run Effect of Financial Frictions

In the left panel of Figure 2, we plot the GDP and TFP in the steady state for a given
λ. They are normalized by their respective value in the perfect-credit case. In our model,
the variation in financial frictions can bring down output per worker by about 30 percent
from the perfect-credit level. This is tantamount to about half of the output per worker
difference between Mexico and the US. The magnitude is nevertheless sizable, considering
that we are varying one single factor—financial markets—across countries. As in the data,
the per-capita income differences in our model are primarily accounted for by differences in
TFP. Financial frictions can reduce aggregate TFP by 24 per cent in our model.
These effects reflect the distortions on production decisions at the intensive and the extensive margin. Intuitively, financial frictions distort the allocation of productive capital
among entrepreneurs in operation. Those with binding collateral constraints will operate
at inefficiently small scales. Financial frictions also distort the entry and exit decisions
of entrepreneurs: Productive-but-poor entrepreneurs delay entry until they can overcome
financing constraints, and incompetent-but-wealthy ones remain in business. Such misallocation is captured in aggregate productivity measures, and explains the lower output in
economies with financial frictions.
The right panel shows that equilibrium interest rates are lower in economies with tighter
collateral constraints (and hence less external financing). Tight collateral constraints (i.e.,
18

low λ’s), holding other things constant, restrict entrepreneurs’ demand for capital (k ≤ λa),
and at the same time increase their self-financing needs and hence saving rates (i.e., a larger
supply of capital). Therefore, the equilibrium interest rate is lower with tighter collateral
constraints. This prediction of our model is consistent with empirical findings and also the
prevalence of “financial repression” in less developed countries (McKinnon, 1981; Ohanian
and Wright, 2008).16
These results give a sense of the impact of financial frictions on the macroeconomy in the
long run. At the same time, the magnitude of the impact suggests that financial frictions
have significant impact on macroeconomic transitions as well, which we confirm in the next
section.
Before we proceed, we briefly discuss what aspects or calibrations of our economy are
essential for financial frictions to have meaningful effects. In particular, we focus on two
parameters: ψ, which controls the persistence of shocks, and η, which controls the dispersion
of entrepreneurial productivity.
Shock persistence has two disparate effects. First, it determines what fraction (1 − ψ)
of individuals will re-draw their ability. If the economy is in a steady state, it can be interpreted as a measure of how much resource reallocation is needed each period, with low
persistence (low ψ) implying more need for the reallocation of production factors among
producers. Second, it determines the likelihood of talented-but-poor entrepreneurs overcoming collateral constraints over time by accumulating collateral. It takes time to accumulate
wealth or collateral, and if the individual productivity is not persistent and hence the profitable opportunities are only short-lived, self-financing is a less effective substitute for credit
markets.
Therefore, holding other things equal, the less persistent the shocks are, the larger the
impact of financial frictions is. This intuition becomes even clearer if one considers the
extreme cases. If the shock is completely permanent, i.e. ψ = 1, financial frictions have no
impact whatsoever in the steady state: All the talented entrepreneurs eventually overcome
the financial frictions by accumulating enough collateral, and there is no need for reallocating
such resources among producers. On the other extreme, we have worked out a version of
our model with ψ = 0; that is, a case where ability shocks is purely i.i.d. over time, again
holding all other parameters constant. Going from perfect credit (λ = ∞) to financial
autarky (λ = 1), we find a 61-percent drop in the steady-state GDP, which is nearly twice
16

This result does not contradict the fact that the cost of capital could be higher in countries with higher
financial intermediation costs. Firstly, economies with higher intermediation costs tend to have a higher
spread between deposit and lending rates. We could introduce this feature into our model without much
difficulty, but it will not change our main results. Secondly, one can think of the quantity-constrained
entrepreneurs in our model as being subject to a prohibitively high marginal (shadow) rental rate of capital.

19

the impact of financial frictions in our calibration of ψ = 0.89. While these results are based
on comparisons across steady states, they clearly suggest that the transition dynamics should
be particularly susceptible to financial frictions when shocks are not too persistent.
The other parameter of interest is η, which controls the degree of heterogeneity in entrepreneurial productivity. The adverse effect of financial frictions in our model materializes
through two channels: the misallocation of entrepreneurial talent (extensive margin) and the
misallocaiton of capital (intensive margin). If there is more heterogeneity and dispersion in
entrepreneurial talent (a lower η), there is a larger extent to which entrepreneurial talent
can be misallocated, and hence the effect of financial frictions will be larger.17
To quantify this intuition, we have worked out a version of our model with η = 6.225,
which implies less dispersion in entrepreneurial talent, holding all other parameters fixed at
their levels in Section 3.1.1. This 50 percent increase in η (from 4.15) translates into less
concentration in the establishment size distribution: With perfect credit markets, now the
decile of largest establishments accounts for 45.3 percent of the total employment, down from
67 percent in Section 3.1.1. Now, going from perfect credit (λ = ∞) to financial autarky
(λ = 1), we find a 27-percent drop in the steady-state GDP; that is, the impact of financial
frictions on long-run GDP is about 15 percent smaller with η = 6.225 than with η = 4.15.
This steady-state result suggests that the effect of financial frictions will be larger when
there is more heterogeneity in entrepreneurial productivity (i.e., a smaller η), although the
magnitude of the impact is not too sensitive to this particular parameter.

3.3
3.3.1

Post-Reform Transition Dynamics
Benchmark Exercise: Removal of Idiosyncratic Distortions

In this exercise, we study the transitional dynamics triggered by a sudden, unexpected reform
that eliminates all idiosyncratic distortions. Once the reform is implemented, everyone
correctly understands that it is a permanent change.
We assume that domestic financial frictions remain the same (at λ = 1.35) throughout
the transition period. The reform experiences of the countries we study in Section 1 are
consistent with this sequencing of reforms. Measured in both de jure and de facto sense,
domestic financial market reforms lagged behind the removal of size-dependent or industryspecific taxes and subsidies (so-called first-generation reforms).
This is a very stark exercise, and simplifies actual reform episodes which tended to be
more gradual. The removal of idiosyncratic distortions was often a protracted affair, even
17

Obviously, more dispersion in entrepreneurial talent necessitates more dispersion in the efficient scale
of operation. As a result, there is also a larger extent to which capital can be misallocated among active
entrepreneurs, leading to a larger impact of financial frictions along the intensive margin.

20

prone to temporary reversals in some cases. In addition, while financial market reforms
were implemented much later and even more gradually than the first-generation reforms,
financial markets did improve over time. Our framework can incorporate these facts, and
indeed we consider a gradual financial development in Section 3.3.3, which is found to further
strengthen our results.
The additional exogenous dynamics regulated by the pace of reforms will give us more
degrees of freedom and hence only help us even more closely match the empirical patterns in
Section 1. The advantage of our stark exercise is that the dynamics following the reform are
wholly endogenous and intrinsic to the model, providing a theory of transitional dynamics
that is built on resource misallocation and financial frictions.
In Figures 3 and 4, we show the transition dynamics following this stark reform. We
collate the model simulation results (black solid lines) with two other series. One is the
corresponding data from Section 1, shown with gray solid lines.18 The other is the transition
dynamics from a standard neoclassical model that is comparably calibrated (dotted lines).
To be more specific, we use a version of our model with perfect capital rental markets
(λ = ∞), which is isomorphic to the standard neoclassical model. We then apply the same
calibration strategy for τ+ , τ− , and q to construct the initial condition for this perfect-credit
transition: After the transition, TFP is one-third higher, and capital-to-output ratio is 37
percent higher, while the taxes and subsidies net out in the distorted initial steady state.
Aggregate output, capital stock and measured TFP are normalized by their respective
levels in the pre-reform steady state.19 Investment-to-output ratios are reported as deviations
from the pre-reform levels.
Three facts stand out.
First, our model transition to the new steady state is slower than the neoclassical dynamics. As shown in the left panel of Figure 4, it takes 10.5 years for capital stock to cover
half the distance to the new steady state in our model, while it takes only 5.5 years in the
comparable neoclassical model. In fact, the capital stock in the model closely matches the
data for as many as 15 years following the reform.
Second, the model generates an endogenous TFP dynamics, although there is no additional exogenous change after the reform in year 0. This reflects more efficient reallocation of
resources over time both at the extensive and the intensive margins, as production shifts from
18

As our model abstracts from the rise in labor force participation and educational attainment along the
economic transitions, we report capital and output per effective unit of labor. That is, we divide capital
stock and GDP by the number of workers adjusting for the average human capital in the population. We
have already used the same procedure to construct the TFP series in Section 1.
19
To be consistent with our TFP calculation in the data, we assign one-third of entrepreneurial income to
capital and the rest to labor. Given our calibration of α, we are using a capital share of one-third (and a
labor share of two-thirds) overall.

Fig. 4: Benchmark Transition, Aggregate Dynamics II

the previously-subsidized entrepreneurs to the productive entrepreneurs previously stunted
by idiosyncratic taxes. The reallocation is gradual, as it is intermediated through imperfect
financial markets. On the contrary, with perfect credit markets, our model aggregates into
a standard neoclassical growth model, which is devoid of endogenous TFP dynamics apart
from the instantaneous jump reflecting the removal of the idiosyncratic distortions.
Third, the investment-to-output ratio is hump-shaped, in contrast to the monotonically
decreasing pattern of neoclassical models. This reflects the evolution of the joint distribution
of wealth and entrepreneurial productivity, as well as individuals’ heterogenoues saving
behavior.
We now explore these three facts in more detail.
In the pre-reform steady state, which is our initial condition for the transition, economic
resources are misallocated partly because of the financial frictions, but also because of the
idiosyncratic distortions. Subsidized entrepreneurs run larger operations and accumulate
more wealth than is warranted by their true productivity, while the opposite is true for taxed
entrepreneurs. Idiosyncratic distortions also distort entry into entrepreneurship, propping
up incompetent entrepreneurs with subsidies and keeping out talented ones with taxes.
22

20

From year 0 on, as the reform eliminates idiosyncratic distortions, resources are reallocated more efficiently. Reallocation occurs along two margins. First, capital and labor
are reallocated among existing entrepreneurs (intensive margin). In addition, more productive entrepreneurs previously taxed out of entrepreneurship will enter into business, while
previously-subsidized incompetent entrepreneurs will exit (extensive margin). The reallocation along these two margins occurs gradually over time, slowed down by the frictions in the
financial market: It takes time for a talented-but-poor entrepreneur to save up the collateral
needed for operating at a profit-maximizing scale.
The more efficient reallocation along these margins is reflected on the measures of TFP,
which increase over time. As the reallocation is subject to the financial frictions, the increase
in TFP exhibits protracted endogenous dynamics that reflect the interaction between the
initial misallocation and financial frictions. GDP also increases following the reform, largely
mirroring the increase in TFP early on (first 6 years) and the accumulation of capital later
(next 15 years or so).

Fig. 5: Benchmark Transition Micro-Implications

In Figure 5, we show in more detail the reallocation at the extensive and the intensive
margins. The left panel shows the average entrepreneurial productivity (e) among active
entrepreneurs, normalized by its pre-reform value. The average increases over time, reflecting the exit of the incompetent entrepreneurs who lose their subsidy and the entry of the
productive entrepreneurs previously kept out by idiosyncratic taxes. The exits are not instantaneous, because subsidized entrepreneurs tend to be rich in the pre-reform economy,
and their wealth offers them an advantage in entrepreneurship in the presence of financial
frictions (tight collateral constraints). Likewise, the entries are not instantaneous, because
taxed entrepreneurs tend to be poor in the pre-reform economy, and they need to save up
enough collateral to start producing at a profitable scale.
The reallocation of production factors at the intensive as well as the extensive margins is
reflected on the evolving wealth distribution in the economy. In the right panel of Figure 5,
23

we show the fraction of the aggregate wealth held by those in the top five percentiles of the
entrepreneurial productivity distribution.20 Those in this group are either active or soonto-be entrepreneurs, and were more likely to be taxed than subsidized in the pre-reform
economy. With the idiosyncratic taxes gone, they would like to scale up to the maximal
profit level, but they are still subject to the collateral constraint. Naturally, they have a
strong self-financing motive to overcome the collateral constraint, and this motive is an
important driver of their saving and hence wealth. Their wealth share rapidly rises from
25 percent of the aggregate wealth in the pre-reform economy to 60 percent. By contrast,
the rest of the population are mostly workers after the reform, and hence do not have a
self-financing motive. Their wealth share initially declines as they consume according to a
higher permanent income brought on by the reform (i.e., wage increases over time), and
also as the previously-subsidized entrepreneurs run down their wealth as they soon cease to
derive collateral services from their wealth.21
These very forces shape the hump in the investment-to-output ratio during the postreform transitions. Following the reform, productive entrepreneurs—such as those in the
top five percentiles of ability—have very high saving rates, largely motivated by the need to
overcome collateral constraints through self-financing. However, because of the idiosyncratic
distortions in the pre-reform days, they account for a relatively small fraction of the aggregate
income and wealth. On the other hand, the others have low, even negative, saving rates: For
workers, their wage will increase over time, and hence they will run down their wealth or try
to borrow; For entrepreneurs who lose their subsidy, their wealth will stop providing collateral
services as they downsize and exit from entrepreneurship, and hence they will also run down
their wealth. Initially, those with low saving rates account for much more income than those
with high saving rates, and therefore, the aggregate saving rate (income-weighted average
of individual saving rates)—and hence investment rate in a closed economy—starts out low.
Over time, as in Figure 5, those with high saving rates account for more and more wealth and
therefore income, and the aggregate saving rate increases. Eventually, with enough wealth
and hence collateral, the saving rate of even the most productive entrepreneurs start to fall,
as in the neoclassical dynamics. This investment-to-output ratio dynamics are embedded in
the transition of aggregate capital, which barely increase for the first 3 years following the
reform, only to accelerate later and eventually decelerate into the new steady state. It takes
10.5 years to cover half the distance to the new steady state, which is almost half the speed
20

With the stochastic productivity process, the identities of those in this group change over time.
Figure 5 will also turn out to accord with a unique micro-level prediction of our model. Although the
unavailability of data precludes direct empirical evidence on average entrepreneurial productivity or wealth
shares by entrepreneurial ability, in Section 4 we present indirect evidence of these series in Figure 5 by
compiling data on the evolution of average establishment size.

24

of the comparably-calibrated neoclassical model, i.e., a model with perfect credit markets
(dotted lines).
By contrast, with perfect credit markets, once the idiosyncratic distortions are eliminated,
the evolution of the wealth distribution is irrelevant for transition dynamics, except for
the first moment (aggregate capital). Thus, any misallocation in the initial condition is
irrelevant for transition dynamics. The standard features of the neoclassical transitions are
confirmed. First, the transition is fast. It takes only 5.5 years (rather than 10.5) to cover
half the distance to the new steady state. For GDP, with the immediate increase in TFP, the
transition is even faster: GDP jumps up nearly by 50 percent immediately. Second, as the
initial capital stock is now less than half of the new steady-state level, the marginal product
of capital is very high initially, and falls over time with capital accumulation. This explains
the monotonically decreasing interest rates (from an unrealistically high level) and the same
pattern in the investment-to-output ratio.
In summary, it is made clear that the rich dynamics in the benchmark exercise are driven
by the financial frictions slowing down the reallocation of initially misallocated resources.
Without financial frictions, initial misallocation becomes irrelevant as soon as idiosyncratic
distortions are eliminated, and our model aggregates to a standard neoclassical growth model.
In other words, the history of initial misallocation does not persist.
3.3.2

Initial Condition without Idiosyncratic Distortions: Technology Shock

We now show that the initial misallocation of wealth and talent is also necessary for the rich
transitional dynamics in the benchmark exercise.
To emphasize the interaction between initial misallocation and financial frictions that
drives the rich transition dynamics in Section 3.3.1, we now construct an initial condition
that has the same degree of misallocation as the new steady state. To have the same degree
of resource misallocation before and after the transition, we must rule out the reform that
eliminates idiosyncratic distortions. As we are interested in isolating the role of initial
misallocation, we hold fixed the degree of financial frictions before and after the transition
at λ = 1.35, as in our benchmark exercise.
Therefore, while in the benchmark exercise, the transition was triggered by the removal
of idiosyncratic distortions, we will need to come up with another way of, first, generating
the difference between the initial and the new steady states, and, second, triggering the
transition from the former to the latter. We decide to use a permanent, proportional change
in the entrepreneurs’ production functions.
More specifically, we construct the initial condition by computing the steady state of an
economy with λ = 1.35 and no idiosyncratic distortions. Starting from this initial condition,
25

we assume that the economy is hit in year 0 by a sudden, unexpected permanent technology
shock that increases all individuals’ productivity proportionately by one-third, the magnitude
by which the measured TFP increased in the transition of Section 3.3.1. The resulting
transition dynamics are shown in Figure 6.

Fig. 6: Transition Dynamics without Misallocation to Unwind

Compared to the benchmark exercise, the transition is faster, with aggregate capital
covering half the distance to the new steady state in 8 years (rather than 10.5), although the
degree of financial frictions is the same in both exercise (λ = 1.35). What is more interesting,
the investment-to-output ratio jumps up and then declines over time, as in the neoclassical
transition.
Furthermore, because the degree of misallocation is constant over time here (i.e., no
change in idiosyncratic distortions or λ), the measured TFP exhibits no meaningful endogenous dynamics, apart from the jump caused by the exogenous aggregate productivity
shock.
To sum, this exercise considers a transition along which the degree of misallocation is
constant. In particular, there is no idiosyncratic distortion all along, and the financial frictions (λ = 1.35) are held constant throughout. The transition is driven by a permanent
aggregate productivity shock. The transition dynamics are qualitatively similar to the neoclassical dynamics, even though the transition is subject to financial frictions. As there is
no notion of misallocation being unwound through the imperfect financial market, financial
frictions have little impact on the transition dynamics. In other words, there is no history
to be prolonged by financial frictions.
The rich dynamics of Section 3.3.1 capture the interaction between the force unwinding
initial misallocation (e.g., a reform that removes idiosyncratic distortions) and the financial frictions that slow down this force. If either is missing, the transitions are at least
qualitatively indistinguishable from the standard neoclassical dynamics.
26

3.3.3

Reform and Financial Development

The benchmark exercise assumes that idiosyncratic distortions are eliminated all at once,
and that financial frictions remain the same throughout. These assumptions are made so
that we can better understand and emphasize the transition dynamics intrinsic to the model.
At the same time, we acknowledge that actual reforms tended to be more gradual, and that
domestic financial markets did improve over time—albeit at a slower pace than reforms in
other dimensions.
Here, we relax the second assumption, and incorporate an exogenous financial development process, which is calibrated to the observed increase in measures of financial intermediation along the growth experiences in Section 1.
To match the external finance to GDP ratio in the pre-reform period, we begin with
λ = 1.13. In year 0, we maintain the assumption that all idiosyncratic distortions are
removed at once. In addition, we assume now that λ increases linearly from 1.13 to 1.55—
where it then stays permanently—over the next 20 years, which implies an increase in the
external finance to GDP ratio from 0.3 to 0.86, which also takes 20 years in the data. We
assume that individuals in the model have perfect foresight about this exogenous λ process.
We assume that the pre-reform economy is the steady state with λ = 1.13 and also with
idiosyncratic distortions. As in the benchmark exercise, we choose the parameters governing
idiosyncratic distortions so that measured TFP is higher by one-third and capital-to-output
ratio is higher by 37 percent after 20 years of post-reform transitions.

Fig. 7: Transition Dynamics with Gradual Financial Development

The transitions are shown in Figure 7. The results are qualitatively similar to the
benchmark results in Section 3.3.1. With a linearly increasing λ, this exercise has more
financial frictions than the benchmark exercise exactly when the economy has the most
misallocation (i.e., right after the reform). Not surprisingly, especially immediately following
the reform, the reallocation and the transitions are slower here: It takes 13 years (rather than
27

20

10.5) for the aggregate capital to cover half the distance to the new steady state. Investmentto-output ratio also rises more gradually than in the benchmark exercise, as the more severe
financial frictions in early stages slow down the growth of talented-but-poor entrepreneurs.
In summary, this exercise makes two points. First, our framework is rich enough that
we can accommodate exogenous paths of financial frictions and, similarly, of the reforms
that reduce idiosyncratic distortions. Second, the gradual financial development in the data
strengthens our quantitative results, as it implies that the financial markets are at their
worst precisely when the economy has the most misallocation to be unwound through them.
3.3.4

Post-Reform Transition with Capital Flows

So far, we have only considered general equilibrium models of economic transitions. Financial frictions limit entrepreneurs’ external sources of capital, and give such constrained
entrepreneurs an extra reason to save: self-financing. As we show in Section 3.2, the effects
on the demand and supply in the capital rental market drive the equilibrium interest rate
down.
If one assumes that the world interest rate is determined by a large country with fully
developed financial markets (i.e., perfect credit markets), this rate is—at 4.5 percent per
year—much higher than the interest rates of the benchmark transition (Figure 4). If an
economy in transition were to open up to capital flows, then capital will flow out of it.
Here, we study the impact of the higher interest rate and the resulting capital outflows on
the post-reform transition dynamics, by executing the benchmark exercise for a small open
economy.22
We assume that the initial condition is the same as in the benchmark exercise. Thus, the
economy can be thought of as being closed prior to year 0. In year 0, a reform eliminates all
idiosyncratic distortions, and liberalizes capital flows at the same time, taking as given the
prevailing world interest rate. As in the benchmark exercise, we assume that local financial
frictions remain as before (λ = 1.35) through the transition. We are assuming that labor is
not mobile across countries.
The results are shown in Figure 8. The most important implication for the open economy
transition is that capital flows out: At the new, high interest rate, domestic entrepreneurs’
demand for capital falls far short of domestic residents’ asset holdings (i.e., supply of capital), and the excess capital goes overseas. In fact, the capital used for domestic production
is smaller here than in the benchmark closed-economy exercise, both during the transition
and in the new steady state, primarily because of the higher capital rental rate. On the
22

This subsection draws upon a related paper of ours (Buera and Shin, 2010), in which we study the
interaction between local financial market frictions and the barriers to international capital flows.

other hand, TFP is higher in the open-economy case than in the closed-economy benchmark. There are two reasons. First, the higher capital rental rate, holding other things
equal, makes entrepreneurship less profitable. This drives out entrepreneurs with marginal
productivity. Second, the higher interest rate allows the poor-but-talented entrepreneurs to
save up faster, as they receive more interest income. Both forces imply better allocation
of entrepreneurial talents into active entrepreneurship, which is then reflected on aggregate
productivity measures. Overall, it happens that domestic output (i.e., GDP) is lower here
than in the closed-economy transition. Note however that domestic residents earn interest
income on their foreign assets, which is repatriated in the form of imported consumption
goods.
3.3.5

A Summary of Transition Dynamics

The rich transition dynamics observed during many growth experiences cannot be explained
by the standard neoclassical model. In our framework, we account for these dynamics as
a process of unwinding resource misallocation, whose pace is determined by the financial
market.
Through the various exercises, we have shown that two ingredients are responsible for
the rich transition dynamics. First, there must exist some misallocation to be unwound over
time. Second, such reallocation must be intermediated through a financial market that is not
perfect. In the benchmark exercise of Section 3.3.1, the removal of idiosyncratic distortions
in year 0 constitutes the former, and the tight collateral constraint of λ = 1.35 embodies the
latter. As a result, we obtain rich, endogenous transition dynamics that are similar to those
observed in the data.
We have also considered a similar reform exercise with perfect credit markets. When
the reform removes idiosyncratic distortions, nothing slows down the reallocation process,

29

20

and hence the misallocation is instantaneously resolved. The economy is isomorphic to the
standard neoclassical model, and so are the resulting transition dynamics.
In the exercise in Section 3.3.2, there is no more misallocation initially than during or
after the transition. Although there are tight financial frictions throughout the transition,
in the absence of meaningful reallocation of resources to be done, the transition dynamics
are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the standard neoclassical dynamics.
In Section 3.3.3, we have shown that the model can incorporate exogenous dynamics
of gradual financial development (and/or gradual reduction of idiosyncratic distortions) to
better match the observed transitional dynamics.

Evidence in Micro-Level Data

Our model provides a simple, quantitative framework for understanding the transitional
dynamics of economies undergoing large-scale, growth-enhancing reforms. At the same time,
the microeconomic heterogeneity in our model gives rise to many micro-level implications
that the standard neoclassical model with a representative firm is silent about. In this
section, we discuss some of these salient implications and confront them with available data.
In the pre-reform economy with its idiosyncratic distortions, productive entrepreneurs
are more likely to be taxed, and hence control a smaller fraction of the aggregate capital
and labor than is warranted by their productivity. Following a reform that removes such
distortions, productive entrepreneurs accumulate collateral (wealth) over time, with capital
and labor being reallocated towards more productive plants both at the extensive and the
intensive margins (Figure 5). As a result, the degree of resource misallocation diminishes,
and the aggregate TFP rises.
One inherent feature of this reallocation process in our model is that the average establishment size—measured by employees per establishment—will increase. One effect of the
idiosyncratic distortions is to blur or break the positive correlation between entrepreneurial
productivity and establishment size. The reallocation of resources at extensive and intensive margins towards productive entrepreneurs, whose scale of operation when financially
unconstrained is larger than that of less productive entrepreneurs, entails an increase in the
average establishment size.
We now present evidence that supports our model in these dimensions. First, we show
that in all of the reform episodes in Section 1 there is substantial and persistent reallocation
of production factors, both across different industrial sectors and from state-owned plants
to private-sector ones. Second, we document a persistent rise in the average establishment
size in the years following the reforms. Finally, we discuss available direct measurements
30

of idiosyncratic distortions and their evolution for China—one of our reform episodes—and
India.
Reallocation after Reforms As we describe in the appendix, one salient theme of all the
reform episodes is the dismantling of import substitution regimes, i.e., tariffs and subsidies
protecting relatively inefficient sectors. More broadly, the reforms were market-oriented, in
the sense that they involved a substantial retrenchment of the government’s intervention in
the economy.
We now present evidence at a disaggregate level that reflects the quantitative importance
of these dramatic policy changes. In particular, one can expect to see some quantitative
evidence of resource reallocation from entrepreneurs in previously-protected industries to
those in export-oriented sectors, and also from state-owned enterprises to private-sector
ones. First, in the absence of more disaggregate data on plant-level factor reallocation, we
construct and report measures of the reallocation of labor across (2-digit) manufacturing
sectors using all available data. Second, we show the sharp rise of private-sector enterprises
in the years following the two reform episodes that have relevant data.
We use the UNIDO data on the employment share of 2-digit manufacturing sectors.
We also draw upon the data from the national statistics agencies of Japan and Taiwan
for the early years not covered by UNIDO.23 We compute the gross reallocation of labor
across 2-digit manufacturing sectors by summing up the absolute values of the year-to-year
changes in each industry’s employment share. In the left panel of Figure 9, we show this
labor reallocation measure of the six countries normalized by the respective long-run average
(average over years 20 through 40 after each reform). The gray solid line is the unweighted
average across the six countries. The reallocation measures are highest around the reform
date, between 1.5 and 3 times their long-run values, with the cross-section average being
double its long-run value. The measures then decline over time: Roughly 8 years after the
reform, the average measure is down to 1.5 times its long-run value.24
For comparison, we also report a measure of labor reallocation in our benchmark transition exercise (Section 3.3.1). Obviously, our model is a one-sector model, and we cannot
construct the exact same sectoral reallocation measure. Instead, we compute the reallocation
of labor across plants year-to-year. Essentially, we are using an even more disaggregate data
to construct a measure of labor reallocation in the model economy following the large-scale
23

For Thailand, there are no annual data that allow us to construct our labor reallocation measure.
The long-run average of our gross labor reallocation measure is 5 percent, when averaged across the six
countries. This is much larger than that of the US: Over the post-ward periods, our gross labor reallocation
measure for the US is 2.4 percent on average, with a standard deviation of 1.0 percent. For the US, there is
no clear time trend, although our measures are highest, unsurprisingly, right after the second world war.

reform that abolished idiosyncratic distortions. Our labor reallocation measure in the model
is normalized by its value in the new steady state, and is depicted with the black solid line
in the left panel of Figure 9. In our benchmark transition, our labor reallocation measure
during the first 6 years after the reform is quite high, starting from 4 times its long-run
value. While not directly comparable, the labor reallocation measures in the data and in the
model affirm that the mechanisms in our theory can capture the substantial reallocation of
production factors across production units following large-scale policy changes and reforms.
As discussed above, the actual reforms required that the government be less interventionist. Following the reforms, the government’s control of the production activities diminished,
with a matching rise of the private-sector enterprises. The relevant data are only available
for China and Taiwan, and shown in the center panel of Figure 9. On the horizontal axis,
year 0 is the reform date for both countries. In both cases, the growth of the private sector
accelerates after the reform, with a particularly sharp break for China. Within 10 years of
the reform, the fraction of Taiwanese GDP accounted for by private enterprises rises from 50
to 75 percent.25 In China, within the same horizon, the fraction of employment accounted
for by private enterprises rises from less than 10 percent to more than 40 percent.
In summary, consistent with the underlying mechanism of our model, the reform episodes
we identify in Section 1 had an important impact on these economies, not only in terms of
the aggregate measures (e.g., GDP and TFP), but also in terms of the measures designed to
capture economic changes at a more disaggregate level.

size distribution after reforms. For data availability considerations, we define an establishment’s size as the number of its employees. In our model, the unconstrained maximal-profit
scale of an establishment is positively correlated with the operating entrepreneur’s ability. If the pre-reform distribution of wealth and entrepreneurial ability is characterize by
substantial misallocation between them, then immediately following the reform, productive
entrepreneurs will be financially constrained and hence operate small plants or none at all.
Those who are wealthy and unconstrained tend to be not as talented (a statement of the
existing ability-wealth misallocation), and choose to operate commensurately small establishments. Over time, as productive entrepreneurs accumulate collateral and overcome the
financing constraints (cf. Figure 5), they will operate larger establishments, driving up the
average establishment size.
In the right panel of Figure 9, we affirm this intuition by showing the post-reform dynamics of the average establishment size in our model (black solid line, normalized by the
pre-reform average establishment size). After a brief drop, the average establishment size
increases by 80 percent over the 14 years following the reform, reflecting the reallocation of
production factors to the most productive entrepreneurs.
The right panel of Figure 9 also shows the time series of the average manufacturing plant
size in Japan, Korea, and Singapore, relative to the size in the respective reform year.26
Consistent with our model implications, the average manufacturing plant size increased after
the reform in all three countries. On average (gray solid line), plant size increased by 80
percent over the 15 years following the reform, strikingly in line with the model prediction
although we did not use this information in our calibration.27
A similar pattern emerges in Thailand, where data on employment by firm size bins are
available. While the data are available only from 1988, five years after the identified reform,
they show a substantial increase in the fraction of workers employed in firms with more than
100 employees (from 21 percent in 1988 to 41 percent in 1998), and also a corresponding
decline in the fraction of workers employed in firms with fewer than 10 employees (from 58
percent to 39 percent).
In summary, our model of macroeconomic transitions has a strong implication on the
evolution of the average scale of production units, which is supported by all available data.
This is a dimension about which the standard neoclassical model with a representative firm
26

We normalize the data by their reform year values to address the fact that the set of plants over which
the average size is calculated varies among these countries. The Japanese data cover all plants with more
than 4 employees, except for between 1963 and 1977, when they include all plants. We spline the Japanese
series to compensate for the discrepancy in coverage. The Korean data include plants with more than or
equal to 5 employees. For Singapore, plants employing 10 or more workers are included.
27
The “over-shooting” in the Korean data around year 16 coincides with its heavy and chemical industry
drive of the late 1970s, which was eventually abandoned.

33

has nothing to say. The rich microeconomic heterogeneity of our model allows us to address
these patterns in data, and, more important, helps us better understand macroeconomic
transitions.
Reduced-Form Measures of Distortions Finally, we discuss some direct evidence on idiosyncratic distortions that has been made available very recently. To measure establishmentlevel distortions, one needs detailed micro data. There exist few such data sets, and not all
of them are readily accessible or reliable. Hsieh and Klenow (2009) use the manufacturing
census data of China and India and compute plant-level distortions based on value-added
and inputs.28 Note that their measure will capture both purely idiosyncratic distortions (e.g.,
idiosyncratic taxes/subsidies, τyi ) and systematic distortions in the economy (e.g., financial
frictions, λ).
Hsieh and Klenow find substantially more plant-level distortions (and the implied resource
misallocation) in China and India than in the US. To give a sense of the impact of the
misallocation, they hypothetically reallocate capital and labor to equalize marginal products
to the extent observed in the US, and find manufacturing TFP gains of 30–60 percent.29
Their findings provide qualitative support for our modeling choice of idiosyncratic distortions
and financial frictions: Our benchmark miracle economy has substantially more micro-level
distortions both before (because of idiosyncratic distortions and financial frictions) and after
(because of financial frictions) the transitions than the perfect-credit economy modeled after
the US, although the degree of distortions and misallocation in the benchmark economy
decreases substantially after the reform.
The data they use, however, cannot directly answer whether there are significant differences in measured plant-level distortions before and after large-scale reforms. The Chinese
data are for 1998, 2001, and 2005, while our reform year for China is 1992: That is, their
observation begins 6 years after the reform. Nevertheless, they do report a decrease in the
dispersion of marginal productivity—the degree of plant-level distortions—over time in the
Chinese manufacturing sector. For example, the difference in marginal productivity between
a plant in the 90th percentile and one in the 10th percentile declines by 28 log points by
2005. This reduction in plant-level distortions and misallocation is reflected in the aggregate
TFP, and Hsieh and Klenow compute that this channel explains about 2 percent per year
growth in measured TFP. This finding is consistent with our model where even the effects
28

Their measure of a plant’s wedge or distortions is the geometric average of its marginal revenue products
of capital and labor, de-meaned by the average of this quantity across all plants within the same (narrowlydefined) industrial sector.
29
In this context, we find reasonable our target moment in Section 3.1.2, the 33-percent long-run TFP
increase from the elimination of idiosyncratic distortions.

34

of once-and-for-all reforms manifest themselves over a prolonged period because of financial
frictions. Also, one can introduce a gradual removal of idiosyncratic distortions into our
model and replicate this finding.30
For India, the data cover 1987, 1991, and 1994. Note that India is not one of the economies
we study in Section 1. While the Indian government delicensed many industries in 1985 and
then in 1991, it lifted its size restrictions much more recently and gradually (1997–2005).
In this regard, the Indian data that Hsieh and Klenow use are not informative about the
evolution of idiosyncratic distortions following large-scale reforms. Again, one can introduce
a sequence of small reforms (i.e., pushing τyi ’s towards 0 piecemeal over time) into our model
to explain the reform and growth experiences of India.
The measurement exercises are useful because they give a sense of the magnitude of
the distortions and resource misallocation in the economy. However, by themselves, they are
silent about the underlying policies or other causes responsible for the misallocation and also
about the particular reforms that reduced them over time.31 We supplement these reducedform measurements with a detailed review of historical accounts of the reform episodes in
the appendix, paying particular attention to actual changes in specific policies.

Concluding Remarks

We have incorporated financial frictions and heterogeneous producers into an otherwisestandard neoclassical growth model, and quantified the role of financial frictions and resource
misallocation in economic development. We find that financial frictions have a large impact
along the transition to the steady state, prolonging the adverse consequences of the initial
misallocaiton of resources—hence the sub-title “the persistence of history”. Our model
economy converges slowly to the steady state, with investment rates and TFP starting low
and rising over time. These are all salient features of the growth miracles.
More broadly, our quantitative framework can be applied to the study of macroeconomic
transition dynamics following major events or aggregate shocks that jolt an economy out of
its status quo.
The post-communist transitions are a relevant example, given the rampant resource
misallocation during the communist era and the abrupt liberalizations that followed. The
transition paths of various Eastern European countries show diverse patterns, which in
30

See Bartelsman et al. (2009) for a study of the role of idiosyncratic distortions in the US, Western
Europe, and the transition economies of Eastern Europe. They find evidence that in the Eastern European
economies idiosyncratic distortions diminished along the transition.
31
Hsieh and Klenow indicate that some of the distortions can be traced to state ownership of plants (China)
and licensing and size restrictions (India).

35

our framework can be quantitatively explained by the differences in their degree of initial
misallocation, in the depth, breadth, and pace of their reforms and liberalizations, and also
in the degree of local financial market frictions.
Another, perhaps more readily relatable to our exercise, is the recent growth acceleration
of Vietnam. Its growth path after the large-scale reforms of 1989 shares many features with
our 7 miracle episodes, both at the aggregate and at the micro level. The reforms drastically
curtailed the government’s intervention in the economy and promoted the private sector.
However, the financial markets in Vietnam largely remain underdeveloped up to this day.
As a result, we observe a sustained period of massive resource reallocation across sectors and
also from state-owned to private enterprises, which also coincided with gradual increases in
the average size of establishments and in aggregate investment rates and TFP.
Our model generates transition dynamics that are substantially slower than the standard
neoclassical dynamics. However, the model transition is not slow enough, when compared
with the data from the growth acceleration episodes. The TFP dynamics in the data appear
particularly protracted. One explanation is that the large-scale reforms were cumulative
and implemented gradually over several years, as is suggested by our review of the reform
history. One can incorporate gradual reforms into our framework in a straightforward manner
to further slow down the model transitions. However, the challenge will then be whether
one can quantitatively discipline the time paths of the reforms, in the absence of direct,
quantified measures of policy distortions.

A

Appendix on Historical Accounts of Reform Episodes

In this appendix, we expand on our discussion in Section 1 and describe the reforms that
preceded the growth accelerations in the 7 economies. In each case, we select as our reform
date the year in which the major reforms were announced: China, 1992; Japan, 1949; Korea,
1961; Malaysia, 1968; Singapore, 1967; Taiwan, 1959; and Thailand, 1983. In reality, these
reforms were unfolded over a few years, and therefore different years could have been selected.
The empirical facts highlighted in Section 1 are robust to such considerations.32
China After a decade in which reforms were primarily focused on the agricultural sector
and rural areas, the second phase of farther-reaching reforms was inaugurated in 1992,
when the Chinese Communist Party endorsed the “socialist market economy” as the guiding
principle of China’s economic reform. These reforms espoused a more unrestricted growth of
private enterprises, going beyond rural township and village enterprises and those in special
development zones. They also expanded and further liberalized special development zones,
and eliminated price controls. During the 1990s, China pressed on with trade liberalization,
and eventually reached a free-trade agreement with the US in 1999 and joined the World
Trade Organization in 2001. (Chow, 2007; Qian, 2000)
Japan The immediate post-war period was characterized by the government’s direct control of the economy (priority production system) under the tutelage of the occupation authority. These policies were broadly based upon the economic arrangements that had prevailed
in the pre-war period. Factor markets, production, and foreign trade were all directly controlled by the government through explicit targets and subsidies. In 1949, under the US
influence, Japan introduced a drastic fiscal adjustment program, which included the elimination of subsidies and price controls and the restoration of private channels of international
trade that bypassed government agencies. The role of the government shifted from directing
production to promoting more efficient technologies (industrial rationalization plans) and
export through tax and credit advantages. (Johnson, 1982; Kosai, 1988)
Korea In the first eight years after the Korean War, Korea relied on an import-substitution
development strategy. In this period, the economy depended heavily on foreign aid, and was
characterized by large fiscal deficits, high inflation, and anemic economic growth. In 1961,
a new political regime came to power through a military coup, and embarked on a period
of aggressive export promotion that replaced previous inward-looking import substitution
policies. This was mainly achieved by combining a free trade regime for exporters, who
were now allowed to import freely intermediate inputs and equipment, with high tariffs for
final goods. This phase was followed by a burst of more interventionist policies in the late
1970s (heavy and chemical industry promotion). From 1982 on, Korea pursued broader
32

Examples of sensible alternatives are: 1953 for Japan, when it regained full sovereignty; 1971 for
Malaysia, when the New Economic Policy provided further incentives to exporters; 1981 for Thailand, when
the government started to gradually adopt export promotion policies.

37

liberalization of trade and capital flows, and a reversal of the credit and tax incentives for
large industrial groups. (Hong, 2002; Kim and Leipziger, 1997; Stern et al., 1995)
Malaysia In the first decade following independence, the Malaysian government intervened
extensively in the economy to promote rural development, and implemented an importsubstitution development strategy. The Investment Incentives Act of 1968 signaled a shift
away from import substitution into export promotion. The Malaysian government accelerated the shift with the New Economic Policy of 1971. Export incentives were given to
new industries, mainly through the designation of export processing zones and free trade
zones. After the brief and unsuccessful state-sponsored heavy industry promotion in the
early 1980s, the 1985–86 recession triggered a second round of market liberalizations aimed
at private sector growth. (Salleh and Meyananthan, 1997)
Singapore During the decade leading to its formal independence in 1965, Singapore pursued import-substitution policies, with housing development and construction playing an
important role. In 1967, following the failed attempt at integrating with Malaysia (1963–
1965), the government had to abandon import substitution as a growth strategy for a city
state with no natural resources. At that point, the government switched its investment
promotion efforts toward export-oriented manufacturing. Direct incentives to exporters included concessionary tax rates on export profits. Trade was continuously liberalized, and by
1973 all quotas and almost all import tariffs were eliminated. (Soon and Tan, 1997)
Taiwan The first decade following the retreat from mainland China witnessed a pervasive
intervention of the government in the economy. The state controlled half of the industrial
production, and its trade policies discouraged imports and exports (e.g., dual exchange rate
regime). In 1959, Taiwan drafted and implemented the Nineteen-Point Program of Economic
and Financial Reform. Its central objectives were to promote private-sector investment and
to gradually diminish the role of the government in industrial production and trade. Import
licensing system was dismantled and tax advantages were granted to exporters. In the late
1970s, Taiwan briefly reverted to import substitution policies, promoting the capital-intensive
heavy and petrochemical industries. These new import substitution policies prevailed until
1982. Since then, the government has broadly liberalized the economy and pursued marketoriented policies. (Dahlman and Sananikone, 1997; Ranis, 1979; Scott, 1979)
Thailand Until the early 1980s, Thailand subscribed to inward-looking policies, favoring
consumer goods industries and capital-intensive industries over the agricultural sector (e.g.,
high tariffs and export taxes on rice). In 1981, the government began to institute policies
promoting export. Export taxes were reduced, and exchange rate controls were eased. At
the same time, an effort to rationalize tariffs was initiated. Starting in 1983, the bias in
favor of capital-intensive industries was removed, and export projects were given priority
through credit and tax advantages. The government streamlined customs procedures and
abolished unnecessary regulations, expediting the export process. Trade liberalization continued through the late 1980s and early 1990s. Furthermore, Thailand undertook extensive
38

domestic financial market liberalization and capital account liberalization in the late 1980s.

Appendix on Numerical Algorithm

B.1

Computing the stationary equilibrium

We solve for the stationary equilibrium of this economy based on the nested fixed-point
algorithm of Aiyagari (1994). The difference is that we have to iterate on both wage w and
interest rate r until both labor and capital markets clear in the stationary equilibrium. We
start by fixing a T , the period by which the economy must have reached the steady state.
We choose T to be 200 years. We numerically verify that increasing T to 300 has virtually
no effect on the invariant distribution.
1. Guess the interest rate in the invariant distribution, r i .
2. Guess the wage in the invariant distribution, w i,j .
3. Given the guesses on interest rate and wage, solve the individuals’ problem in the
stationary equilibrium. Given the optimal decision rule, simulate N individuals for T
periods. We set N = 350, 000.
4. Check the labor market clearing condition in period T . If there is excess labor demand
(supply), choose a new wage w i,j+1 that is greater (smaller) than w i,j .
5. Repeat Steps 3–4 until the labor market clears in period T .
6. Check the capital market clearing condition in period T . If there is excess capital
demand (supply), choose a new interest rate r i+1 that is greater (smaller) than r i .
7. Repeat Steps 2–6 until the capital market also clears in period T .

B.2

Computing the transition dynamics

To compute the entire transition dynamics, we have to iterate on the wage and interest
rate sequences. Taking the wage and interest rate sequences as given, we solve for the
individuals’ problem—Problem (2), and then check whether labor and capital markets clear
for all periods. We fix T at 125. We numerically verify that increasing T to 150 has no effect
on the transition dynamics.
1. Guess at an interest rate sequence {rti }Tt=0 .
2. Guess a wage sequence {wti,j }Tt=0 . Compute the value function of the stationary equilibrium, and let vT (a; e) = v(a; e). By backward induction, taking the wage sequence
{wti,j }Tt=0 and the interest rate sequence {rti }Tt=0 as given, compute the value function
vt (a; e) for t = T − 1, . . . , 0. Using the optimal decision rule, simulate N individuals
for T periods. We again set N = 350, 000. Check whether the labor market clears in
every period. Taking the individuals’ capital holdings as given, construct a sequence
{̟ti,j }Tt=0 that clears the labor market for each period. Update the wage sequence:
wti,j+1 = ηw ̟ti,j + (1 − ηw )wti,j , ∀t, with ηw ∈ (0, 1). Iterate on the wage sequence until
convergence.
39

3. Once the wage sequence converges, check whether the capital market clears in all
periods. Taking the individuals’ capital holdings as given, construct a sequence {ιt }Tt=0
that clears the static capital rental market for each period. The updated interest rate
sequence now will be ηr ιt + (1 − ηr )rti , ∀t, with ηr ∈ (0, 1).
4. Repeat Steps 2–3 until the interest rate sequence also converges.
As we cannot guarantee the uniqueness of a numerically-constructed competitive equilibrium,
we tried many different initial guesses of the wage and interest rate sequences, as well as
several values of the relaxation parameters (ηw , ηr ). All our competitive equilibria withstood
these robustness checks.
