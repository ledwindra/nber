    "abstract": "\n\nExisting theoretical models of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status have strong implications for the association of outcomes across multiple generations of a family.  These models, however, are highly stylized and do not encompass many plausible avenues for transmission across multiple generations.  This paper extends existing models to encompass some of these avenues and draws out empirical implications for the multigenerational persistence of socioeconomic status.\n\n",
