    "abstract": "\n\nA nationally representative sample of respondents estimated their fatality risks from four types of natural disasters, and indicated whether they favored governmental disaster relief.  For all hazards, including auto accident risks, most respondents assessed their risks as being below average, with one-third assessing them as average.  Individuals from high-risk states, or with experience with disasters, estimate risks higher, though by less than reasonable calculations require. Four-fifths of our respondents favor government relief for disaster victims, but only one-third do for victims in high-risk areas.  Individuals who perceive themselves at higher risk are more supportive of government assistance.\n\n",
