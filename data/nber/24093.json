    "abstract": "\n\nOne of the statements of purpose of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was \u201cto assist those most impacted by the recession.\u201d To consider this facet, the grants-in-aid portion of the ARRA is assessed from the perspective of \ufb01scal federalism. We estimate a trend-stationary autoregressive model of county-level wage income dynamics where each county is subject to a common shock (with county-speci\ufb01c factor loading) and an idiosyncratic shock. We then ask if counties that experienced larger negative wage income shocks during the Great Contraction subsequently received more transfers per capita in the form of grants-in-aid. The fact that the negative business cycle shocks pre-date the passage of the ARRA and subsequent disbursements allows identi\ufb01cation of the risk-pooling channel of the grants before \ufb01scal multiplier e\ufb00ects confound these two channels. We \ufb01nd statistically signi\ufb01cant and economically large risk-pooling e\ufb00ects.\n\n",
