Does Parents’ Access to Family Planning Increase Children’s Opportunities? Evidence from

ABSTRACT
This paper examines the relationship between parents’ access to family planning and the
economic resources of their children. Using the county-level introduction of U.S. family planning
programs between 1964 and 1973, we find that children born after programs began had 2.8%
higher household incomes. They were also 7% less likely to live in poverty and 12% less likely to
live in households receiving public assistance. A bounding exercise suggests that the direct
effects of family planning programs on parents’ resources account for roughly two thirds of these
gains.

We have a growing concern to foster the integrity of the family and the opportunity for each child. It is
essential that all families have access to information and services that will allow freedom to choose the
number and spacing of their children.
~President Lyndon Johnson, Special Message to the Congress on Domestic Health and Education, March 1,
1966.
…I called for a national commitment to provide a healthful and stimulating environment for all children
during their first five years of life. One of the ways in which we can promote that goal is to provide
assistance for more parents in effectively planning their families. …Unwanted or untimely childbearing is
one of several forces which are driving many families into poverty or keeping them in that condition.
~President Richard Nixon, Special Message to the Congress on Problems of Population Growth, July 18,
1969.

A growing body of literature shows that early childhood and family characteristics are important
determinants of lifetime health, earnings, and well-being (Almond and Currie 2011). Household income in
childhood, in particular, is one of the strongest correlates of completed education and adult health (Case et al.
2002, Almond and Currie 2011). There are many potential reasons: Poor children receive fewer parental time
and resource investments and are more likely to experience health and academic problems, live in more
dangerous neighborhoods, attend underperforming schools, and be incarcerated (Guryan et al. 2008, Levine
and Zimmerman 2010). Poor children ultimately have lower academic test scores (Reardon 2011), lower
rates of high school and college completion (Bailey and Dynarski 2011), and ultimately lower earnings in
adulthood (Pew Charitable Trusts 2012).
This cycle of disadvantage is the target of a variety of public policies and programs which aim to
reduce gaps in early childhood resources and improve children’s lifetime outcomes (Currie and Rossin-Slater
2015). Programs such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) directly raised the household incomes of poor children at costs of around $10 and $63 billion
in 2013, respectively. Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan (S-CHIP) contributed
roughly $444 billion for children’s health insurance in 2013. Head Start provided $8 billion for pre-school
programs for around 930,000 disadvantaged children in 2014.
This paper evaluates the relatively less studied impact of family planning programs on childhood
disadvantage. Although largely absent from today’s policy discussions of childhood disadvantage, family
planning programs have been considered a means to improve children’s lives since at least the 1960s

1

(Johnson 1966, Nixon 1969). Economic theory predicts that family planning programs could directly impact
children’s opportunities by increasing the incomes of their parents. This direct “resource effect” would
result if family planning programs reduce the cost of avoiding unintended pregnancies, which constrain
parents’ choices both when they occur and even when they do not occur (because they influence parents’
expectations and, therefore, discourage their investments). By reducing the cost of avoiding unintended
pregnancies, family planning programs may encourage parents’ investments in their human capital,
partnerships, and careers (Goldin and Katz 2002, Bailey 2006, Hock 2008, Christensen 2011, Bailey et al.
2012). With standard assumptions about the income elasticity of child quality, a rise in income should itself
serve to increase investment in each child and should be reinforced by the substitution effect (Becker and
Lewis 1973, Willis 1973). To this point, empirical evidence shows that wanted children tend to have better
health at birth (Corman and Grossman 1985, Grossman and Joyce 1990, Gruber et al. 1999) and be treated
better by their parents (David et al. 2003, David 2006).
This paper provides novel evidence on the resource effect of family planning programs on
children’s economic resources. Our research design exploits the roll-out of federally funded family planning
programs between 1964 and 1973 within a dynamic, event-study framework (Bailey 2012). Using the
restricted-use long-form 1970 and 1980 Census samples, we compare the outcomes of children in the same
county born before and after federally funded family planning programs began. We find that cohorts born
after programs began were significantly more economically advantaged. They lived in households with 2.8
percent higher annual incomes. They were 7 percent less likely to live in poverty and 12 percent less likely
to live in households receiving public assistance. These changes were driven in part by older mothers
reducing unwanted pregnancies. As a result, the average child was slightly more likely to live with two
parent families, have a younger mother, and fewer older siblings.
Understanding the role of “selection” in driving these findings is crucial their interpretation. If these
gains in the outcomes of the average child reflect reductions in childbearing among disadvantaged parents,
this selection effect could raise the income of the average child (because the poorest children are missing)
even though the resources available to any child that is born would not increase. The importance of selection

2

may be quantitatively large, because the federally funded family planning programs affected contraceptive
use among more economically disadvantaged women (Jaffe et al. 1973, Torres and Forrest 1985). 1 If, on
the other hand, family planning programs directly increase the household incomes of the average child (e.g.,
by encouraging investments in human capital, careers, and partnerships), our estimates imply a sizable and
understudied role of family planning programs as an anti-poverty program. 2
A bounding exercise informs our understanding of the contribution of selection to our findings. If
selection follows the same income distribution as the distribution of incomes of family planning users, the
exercise suggests that selection accounts for around 36 percent of the total increase in the income of the
average child. That is, family planning programs directly raised incomes available to children by around
$1,200 per year in 2013 dollars (the remaining 64 percent of the rise in children’s average incomes). Taking
into account the uncertainty in these estimates, the lower confidence interval on the resource effect can
explain at least 16 percent of the estimated gains, or $300 per year.
This finding underscores an important and understudied return to family planning programs: they
appear to directly raise parents’ income by allowing them to invest in their human capital, careers, and find
stable partnerships. This implies that a large share of the substantial education and labor-market gains to
the children of mothers with access to family planning programs (documented in Bailey 2013) may be
explained by the program’s direct impact on their parents. Accounting only for the effects on child poverty,
the resource effect of family planning programs’ may reduce child poverty in the U.S. at around half of the
cost of the EITC and one quarter of the cost of TANF. Because higher household incomes also increase
children’s human capital investments, these estimates suggest that the long-term effects of family planning
programs on children’s economic opportunities may be even greater.

1

Family planning programs in the period we study were not means tested, but more affluent women tended to use
other sources of care. A related literature suggests the potential importance of abortion legalization via the selection
effect is large in both the short run (Gruber et al. 1999) and the longer run (Pop-Eleches 2006, Ananat et al. 2009).
2
A large literature studies the relationship of childbearing to child welfare. Schultz (2008) provides a thorough review
of these studies in the context of developing countries. A much smaller literature studies the relationship of family
planning programs and children’s outcomes. See Miller and Babiarz (2015) for a review of these studies for middleand low-income countries. Section II of our paper also reviews related studies of abortion legalization in the U.S.

I.

A HISTORY OF U.S. FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS AND THEIR EXPECTED EFFECTS ON
CHILDREN’S OUTCOMES
The architects of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty viewed the price of reliable

contraceptives as a barrier to reducing poverty and promoting children’s economic well-being. Of particular
concern was that the “Pill”, the first oral contraceptive, was prohibitively costly in the 1960s. An annual
supply of oral contraception sold for the equivalent of $812 in 2013 dollars (Bailey 2013)—roughly twice
today’s annual cost and equivalent to more than three weeks of full-time work at the 1960 minimum wage
(without factoring in the cost of visiting a physician). Numerous studies documented at the time that poor
women were less likely to use effective contraceptives. We calculate in the 1965 National Fertility Study
(NFS), for instance, that poor women were 44 percent (0.082 percentage points / 0.185, s.e. 0.023) less
likely to use the Pill than more affluent women. They also had roughly 0.60 (s.e. 0.16) more children on
average than families with higher incomes.
To reduce disparities in access to contraception, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) began
funding family planning programs as early as 1964. OEO grants rose to roughly $427 million (2013) by
1970 and supported the opening of new clinics in disadvantaged areas and, to a lesser extent, the expansion
of existing family planning programs. In November 1970, Congress passed Title X of the Public Health
Service Act (also known as the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act, P.L. 91-572). By
1974, this legislation had increased federal support by 50 percent in real terms over 1970 levels. (See Bailey
2012 and Bailey 2013 for a detailed history of these programs and federal funding.)
The aim of these programs was to bring education, counseling, and the provision of low-cost
contraceptives and related medical services to disadvantaged women. Family planning grants did not fund
abortion, which was illegal before 1970 except in special circumstances. And, even after abortion was
legalized in several states and nationally in 1973, Title X explicitly prohibited the use of federal funds “in
programs where abortion is a method of family planning” (§1008). During these early years, little is known
about these programs’ day-to-day operations. The federal government did not collect information on their
services or patients, and officials talked very little about them—perhaps because topics like birth control

4

were taboo. 3 This dearth of evidence limits detailed exploration of the mechanisms of our effects. To the
extent that family planning programs varied in their implementation, the effects we estimate will represent
the weighted combination of many services and types of programs, all of which provided reduced cost
contraceptives and related services.
Between 1964 and 1973, family planning began in different counties around the U.S., providing
the identifying variation for this study. Figure 1 shows the roll-out of these family planning programs at the
county level. The earliest programs, established between 1964 and 1967, are shaded in red; the programs
established between 1968 and 1969, during the expansion of family planning as a national emphasis
program, are orange; and programs established from 1970 to 1973 under Title X are green. By 1973, federal
funding had initiated or substantially expanded over 660 family planning programs in each of the lower 48
states. These programs funded services in locations where roughly 56 percent of the U.S. population of
women ages 15 to 44 lived.
A. The Impact of Federal Grants on Use of Family Planning Services and Fertility Rates
Between 1969 and 1984, the number of family planning patients at federally funded programs grew
400 percent (Torres and Forrest 1985: 284), but no previous study has documented how much of this
increase in the use of services was caused by federal funds. To the extent that patients of federally funded
family planning programs had received services elsewhere or paid themselves, this 400 percent increase
will overstate the impact of federal grants on the use of family planning services.
Two new data sources uniquely allow this paper to describe the effect of federal funding on the use
of family planning services and the birth control pill. The first is a series of OEO reports from four different
years. These reports supply information on the use of family planning services by county as reported by all
known providers (hospitals, health departments, and clinics operated by other agencies) (OEO 1969, OEO

3

Levitan (1969: 209) writes that, “Contrary to the usual OEO tactic of trying to secure the maximum feasible visibility
for all its activities, the OEO prohibited [family planning] grantees from using program funds to ‘announce or promote
through mass media the availability of the family planning program funded by this grant.’” Before 1965, U.S. federal
involvement and investments in family planning had been modest.

5

1971, OEO 1974). 4 We entered these data and estimate a differences-in-differences specification, where
we code the first year a county receives a federal grant as the “treatment” dummy. 5 Panel A of Table 1
shows that federal family planning programs significantly increased the use of family planning services
among women counted as “medically indigent” (i.e., those who could not afford care). The share of family
planning patients served at all locations who are deemed medically indigent by the provider increased by
around 2.7 percentage points after the federal family planning programs began. These estimates are robust
to the inclusion of additional covariates (cols. 1 to 3) and about half the magnitude of the national increase
in family planning program use over the same period.
The second data source is the 1970 NFS. This survey sampled ever-married women between the
ages of 18 and 44 and provides an alternative perspective from the point of view of individuals. We estimate
a probit model to examine whether respondents living in counties that had received a federal family
planning grant before 1970 were more likely to have used the Pill by the time of the survey. We also
examine whether the expected increase in Pill use was larger among poorer women. 6 The estimates show

4

Completion rates of the survey were high. In 1968, for example, 97 percent of hospitals and 100 percent of all other
agencies responded (OEO 1969, table 3: 244). The purpose of the survey was to approximate the universe of potential
family planning providers for our period of interest and document the number of “medically indigent” patients. This
term was defined by the OEO to mean those who could not afford care due to lack of income but they did not
recommend a specific income threshold. The definition, therefore, likely varied across providers.

individual i in county j had ever used family planning or the birth control pill, 1(Tj∗ < 1970) is a binary variable equal
to one if county j received a federal family planning grant before the survey date, and 1�Povij � is a binary variable
equal to 1 if the annual household income in 1970 fell below the poverty line. County fixed effects cannot be included
with this single cross-section, but we include a rich set of covariates, Z, including state fixed effects, dummy variables
for age, educational achievement, population size of the county, and Catholic religion. In addition, one specification
includes dummy variables for the “number of children most desirable” to capture residual, unaccounted-for differences
in the demand for children. Panel B of Table 1 reports average partial effects associated with 𝜃𝜃1 and 𝜃𝜃3 from a probit
and bootstrapped standard errors (1000 replications) and capture differences in the use of family planning services
and the Pill in funded counties by 1970.

that poor women in areas that had federal family planning programs by 1970 were much more likely to
have used the Pill relative to poor women in areas receiving programs after 1970, an increase of around 23
to 30 percent (13 to 17 percentage points) over the mean for poor women (Table 1, panel B). This effect of
receiving a federal family planning grant is large enough to erase income-based differentials in Pill use. 7
The sparseness of these data limits strong conclusions, but both analyses suggest that federal grants
increased the use of family planning services by a sizable amount. 8
As a result, family planning also decreased childbearing. 9 In work closely related to this study,
Bailey (2012) exploits the county-level roll-out of federal family planning programs between 1964 and
1973 as a natural experiment to quantify their fertility effects. The idea behind using the program roll-out
is that the timing of implementation approximates the conditional random assignment to greater access to
family planning services. Using an unweighted, event-study specification and county-level Vital Statistics
data on births from 1959 to 1988, she shows that fertility rates fell by 2 percent within 5 years after federal
family planning programs began and remained approximately 1.7 percent lower up to 15 years later (See
Bailey 2012, table 2). Supporting the validity of her research design, differences between eventually funded
counties and never funded counties were not statistically different from zero in the pre-period and postfunding effects are robust to the inclusion of county and year fixed effects, state-by-year fixed effects, and
a variety of time-varying county-level covariates. 10

Another interesting finding is that Pill use increased by about 4 percentage points for women above the poverty line
in funded locations. This estimate is not statistically significant but suggests family planning grants may have reduced
the price of the Pill among women using other sources of family planning.
8
The OEO reports were collected at only four points in time, and the 1970 NFS do not have complete coverage of all
counties or time periods and exclude never married women.
9
Reductions in childbearing likely reflect both reductions the number of wanted and unwanted births and change the
desired timing of childbirth (Michael and Willis 1976).
10
A related study by Kearney and Levine (2009) of the more recent period exploits state-level variation in Medicaid
eligibility for family planning among the near poor within a differences-in-differences framework. This study finds
that greater eligibility for services in 17 states significantly reduced birth rates among teens (by 4 percent) and among
older women (by 2 percent) within a few years.
7

7

Bailey (2012) provides four additional pieces of evidence to support the internal validity of this
research design. 11 First, oral histories and interviews note that the OEO funding was not targeted or well
organized. Robert Levine (1970) sums up the situation saying, “It was an era of great administrative
confusion.” Second, quantitative evidence supports the conditional random assignment assumption. Aside
from urbanicity, 1960 county characteristics found to predict the roll-out of other War on Poverty programs
fail to predict the initiation of federal family planning programs. Moreover, 1964 fertility rates or 1960 to
1964 changes in fertility rates are uncorrelated with the initiation of federal family planning programs. This
means that applicants were not more likely to apply for programs and that administrators were not more
likely to prioritize funding programs based on differentially high (or low) fertility rates.
Third, reproductive and contraceptive attitudes and behaviors in the 1965 NFS are uncorrelated
with the initiation of federal family planning programs. These include pro-natalist attitudes, contraceptive
use and behaviors, and family background characteristics correlated with the number of children. In
addition to examining these outcomes individually, we also follow Kling et al. (2007) and create a summary
index of equally weighted average z-scores for these outcomes—a technique that serves to improve the
statistical power to detect correlations that move in a common direction. Neither approach finds evidence
that federal family planning grants are related to these outcomes individually or when combined in an index
(coefficient: 0.054, robust standard error: 0.047, observations: 2,857). 12
A final piece of quantitative evidence shows that the initiation of federal family planning programs
is uncorrelated with the initiation of other War on Poverty programs. The likelihood of receiving a family
planning grant does not appear to be correlated with the likelihood of receiving a community health center,
a Head Start grant, a jobs program grant, a legal services grant, or a grant for maternal and infant care. In

11

For the interested reader, some of this evidence is summarized in Online Appendix A.
This z-score index excludes age at first pregnancy and age at first Pill use from the index. Including the age at first
pregnancy (which implicitly omits women who never became pregnant), we find that the year of the first federal grant
to family planning is positively but insignificantly related to the index (coefficient: 0.043, robust standard error: 0.054,
observations: 2,607). We exclude when a woman first used the Pill (appendix Table A1, col. 6) because it is often
missing and inclusion severely limits our sample size.

12

8

short, the qualitative and quantitative evidence is consistent with the implementation timing of federal
family planning grants being conditionally, randomly assigned to U.S. counties.
II.

THE EXPECTED EFFECTS OF FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS ON THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES
OF CHILDREN
The increased availability of family planning services could affect the economic and living

circumstances of children through two main channels: what we call the resource effect and selection.
The resource effect refers to the situation where family planning directly raises the incomes of
parents. This would be the case if soon-to-be parents could use family planning services to delay
childbearing in order to get more education, pursue different career paths, or obtain different amounts of
work experience and job training. In addition, women should make different investments in their careers or
stay attached to a job if they expect to be able to control future childbearing. If family planning programs
allow older women to time births better, they could raise the labor-force participation of mothers, which
could have large effects on household incomes of children once they are born. 13
Evidence regarding the existence of this resource effect comes from the literature on legal access
to the birth control pill for younger women. Using variation in state laws regulating the age of consent for
(mostly) unmarried teens (Bailey et al. 2011, Guldi 2011), this literature shows that access to the birth
control pill affected marital and birth timing and had lasting effects on women’s and men’s career
investments. With earlier legal access to the Pill, women and men were more likely to enroll in and complete
college (Hock 2008, Bailey et al. 2012). Women were more likely to work for pay, invest in on-the-job
training, and pursue non-traditional professional occupations (Goldin and Katz 2002, Bailey 2006, Bailey
et al. 2012). And, as women aged, these investments resulted in higher wages (Bailey et al. 2012). Ananat
and Hungerman (2012) additionally show that access to contraception at younger ages improved the

13

On the other hand, parents may decide to have children earlier in their careers if subsequent births are more easily
avoided, which could reduce the incomes of children in the short run but not necessarily in the long run.

9

economic resources of children born to these women, although they provide no evidence on whether these
gains accrued due to selection or the resource effect. 14
Another channel for family planning’s resource effect is through partnership decisions. For
instance, family planning programs could reduce the price of delaying marriage (Goldin and Katz 2002)
and improve spouse matching and reduce marital stress, thereby reducing subsequent divorce rates
(Christensen 2011, Rotz 2016). If family planning programs increase the likelihood that parents remain
together after a child is born, this will also serve to increase the economic resources available to children. 15
The alternative to the resource effect is the selection effect. Selection refers to the channel through
which family planning programs alter who becomes a parent. This shift in the composition of parents could
improve the living circumstances of the average child even in the absence of any direct effect of family
planning programs on parental income. For instance, if fewer children are born to lower income parents,
the resources of the average child could rise even though the incomes of any child that is born do not.
Selection may be a particularly important channel in explaining these programs’ effects on children
because programs in the 1960s disproportionately served poorer households. Roughly 83 percent of these
family planning patients had incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line, and 13 percent were recipients
of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC, the principal cash welfare program at the time) (Jaffe
et al. 1973, Torres and Forrest 1985: 284).
Separating the resource and selection effects in cross-sectional, retrospective data is impossible to
do directly, because the two effects appear identical. Notably, although the literature quantifying the impact
of legal abortion on children’s outcomes in the U.S. attributes all of the gains to selection, this literature’s
findings could also partially reflect a resource effect. This literature uses the staggered legalization of firsttrimester abortion in the U.S., initially in five states around 1970 and then in the remainder of states after

14

Some studies, however, show that women who became mothers in their teens (relative to teens who miscarried)
had higher subsequent levels of employment and earnings (Hotz et al. 2005).
15
Akerlof et al. (1996) suggest an alternative model in which family planning programs reduce the cost of non-marital
sex and, therefore, increase non-marital childbearing. If non-marital childbearing increases, this should tend to lower
household incomes of the average child.

10

Roe v. Wade in 1973. Empirical studies show that birth rates fell by 4 to 8 percent (Levine et al. 1996) and
that the outcomes for cohorts born after abortion was legalized improved. Gruber et al. (1999) shows that
children born after abortion legalization were less likely to die as infants, live with single parents or in
families receiving welfare, and live in poverty. Ananat et al. (2009) find that, later in life, these children
were more likely to graduate from college, less likely to rely on welfare and less likely to be single parents.
Donohue and Levitt (2001) show that cohorts born after abortion legalization were less likely to commit
crime, 16 and Charles and Stephens (2006) show that these cohorts were less likely to use controlled
substances in their late teens. One study of Romania explicitly considers the role of selection. When
Romania experienced the reverse policy change—the prohibition of abortion, Pop-Eleches (2006) shows
that birth rates among the most educated mothers (who had been using abortion and family planning
services) increased by around 30 percent. After accounting for this positive selection of mothers, however,
the paper shows that these unintended children fared worse in terms of their later socio-economic outcomes.
In summary, the availability of family planning programs may increase family resources of both
younger and older parents. However, family planning programs could also affect children’s measured
outcomes by altering selection into parenthood. Bailey’s (2013) findings that family planning programs
improved the adult outcomes is consistent with both channels. Increases in parents’ incomes or changes in
selection (or a combination of both) could raise college completion rates and raise incomes by 2 percent for
the average adult child. Understanding the quantitative importance of the resource and selection channels
is, therefore, crucial to interpreting these estimates. The next section describes this paper’s empirical
strategy to estimate the effects through the combined resource and selection channels. After quantifying
these combined effects, we bound the role of selection to recover an estimate of the direct effect of family
planning programs on parents’ incomes.

Claims that abortion reduced crime are disputed (Donohue and Levitt 2004, Joyce 2004, Dills and Miron 2006,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND DATA

The restricted, long-form samples of the 1970 and 1980 Censuses provide information on children’s
economic resources and living circumstances. In addition to their large sample sizes (20-percent and 16percent samples of the U.S. population for 1970 and 1980, respectively), these samples identify counties of
residence (this information is suppressed in public samples). 17 Our analysis aggregates the economic
resources and living circumstances of children under age 18 into birth-year/county cohorts. 18 These birthyear/county cohorts are then linked to information on when their county received a federally funded family
planning program. 19
Our primary specification exploits variation in the timing of the first federal family planning grants
to identify the program’s effects. In practice, our event-study framework contrasts the evolution of
outcomes for cohorts born after family planning programs began to those born before they were available
and allows adjustments for a variety of potentially confounding factors:

where Y is a measure of the outcomes for children residing in county j within state s and born in calendar

These data come from the National Archives Records about Community Action Program Grants and Grantees,
which contain information on OEO family planning programs, and the National Archives Federal Outlay files, which
contain information on programs funded under Title X. Bailey (2012) describes these data in greater detail.
20
Data limitations (federal family planning grant information is missing for some years) make it impossible to use
federal grant dollars as the independent variable of interest. But even if this was feasible, we prefer a binary measure
of family planning access for several reasons. Using variation in federal funding could also be related to program
performance, which could induce reverse causality and threaten the interpretation of our estimates. Second, as
described in section I, federal dollars paid for infrastructure when needed and also many programs were heavily
supported by other public and non-profit funds by the end of the period of interest. Thus, federal dollars are poor
proxies of program size or intensity. Our specification captures the fact that federal dollars created or significantly
expanded family planning programs.

recover the regression-adjusted evolution of children’s outcomes for cohorts born from six years before and
up to six years after each county received its first federal family planning grant for a balanced set of
counties. In our analysis, event time, c, runs from a years before up to b years after the date of the first
family planning grant, where the 1970 Census covers a=-7 through b=0, and the 1980 Census covers a=-3
through b=7. We do not pool the two Censuses because the 1970 data identifies τ with only the 461 counties
funded prior to 1970, whereas in the 1980 data the full set of funded counties identify τ. Both Censuses,
therefore, independently estimate event years -3 through 0, and using both Censuses allows us to estimate
𝜏𝜏 using a balanced set of counties for the greatest range of event time. 21

Our baseline specification includes θ, a set of county fixed effects which capture time-invariant

county-level differences, a set of birth-year fixed effects, and γ, and a set of state-by-birth year fixed effects
that capture time-varying changes in state policies, including abortion legalization and the roll-out of
Medicaid. We present unweighted results (Solon et al. 2015). Standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity and corrected for serial correlation within state (Arellano 1987, Bertrand et al. 2004).
The robustness of these baseline results are examined by sequentially including covariates used in
other studies of the War on Poverty. Covariates include annual information on per capita measures of
government transfers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Regional Information System (REIS) (cash
public assistance benefits such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Supplemental Security Income,
and General Assistance; medical spending such as Medicare and military health care; and cash retirement
and disability payments) (Almond et al. 2011). In some specifications, we also include the number of

21

The 1980 Census only covers a two-year cohort pre-trend for a balanced set of counties because many of the
individuals in cohorts born before 1963 had begun leaving home (and the earliest family planning programs began in
1965). Therefore, we set a=−3 when c≤−3 and b=7 when c≥7, and event-years −2 through 6 are estimated using all
funded counties for the 1980 Census. Using the 1970 Census, we set a=−7 when c≤−7 and b=1 when c≥1, and event
years -6 through 0 are estimated using all funded counties. c=0 is omitted in both cases to facilitate easy comparisons
across Census years.

abortion providers, which accounts for within-state changes in the provision of abortion between 1970 and
1979 (Bailey 2012). 22
An important challenge to our analysis is that the Censuses contain information on a child’s
residence in (or five years before) the Census year—not residence at the time of the child’s birth. If mothers
move between the time of birth and observation in the Census, this could lead us to misclassify mothers’
access to federal family planning around the time of conception. We take several steps to limit this mobility
induced misclassification. First, we use county of residence five years before the Census, because 1975 is
more temporally proximate to the year of birth for cohorts of children identifying our parameters of interest
(and, therefore, more strongly correlated with mother’s exposure to family planning) than 1980; we use
1965 for the 1970 Census for consistency. Second, we exclude unfunded areas from our estimation sample,
because of their differential mobility relative to funded areas after family planning programs started.
Finally, we follow Card and Krueger (1992) to adjust for mobility using a post-estimation correction. 23
(See Online Appendix B for a discussion and additional results related to corrections for mobility bias.)
IV.

THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS ON THE ECONOMIC
RESOURCES OF CHILDREN
We begin by examining the effects of family planning programs on the log household income of

the average child born. Figure 2 presents results from our baseline model, which includes county and stateby-birth-year fixed effects. Estimates to the left of the vertical axis represent cohorts born in event years

22

The interactions of county covariates are identical to those in Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2011). Because
information on abortion providers is not available at the county level before 1973, we follow Joyce, Tan, and Zhang
(2013) in assuming the number of providers in 1970 to 1972 in states that legalized before Roe v. Wade is identical to
the number observed in 1973.
23
Card and Krueger note that the estimated coefficients affected by mobility, 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 , are a reweighting of the true
coefficients, 𝜏𝜏𝑗𝑗∗ . In our case, 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 = ∑𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗=𝑎𝑎 𝜏𝜏𝑗𝑗∗ ∙ 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗,𝑐𝑐 , where 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗,𝑐𝑐 is the probability of being born in a county treated with
family planning j years before birth conditional on living in a county at the time of the Census that was treated c years
before birth. We use the matrix form of the equation to recover the full set of estimates, 𝝉𝝉∗ = 𝝉𝝉𝑷𝑷−𝟏𝟏 . 𝝉𝝉 is a (b-a+1) × 1
column vector containing each of the event-study coefficients, 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 for c=a, a+1, a+2…, b, and P is a (b-a+1) × (b-a+1)
matrix with elements of the transition probabilities, 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗,𝑐𝑐 , such that 𝝉𝝉 = 𝝉𝝉∗ 𝑷𝑷. We estimate 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗,𝑐𝑐 , as the probability of
living in a county in 1975/1965 receiving a family planning program j years before a birth conditional on living in a
county in 1980/1970 that received a family planning program c years before birth. This assumes that county-to-county
misclassification of treatment status between 1975 and 1980 (or 1965 and 1970) is correlated with mobility induced
misclassification that occurred before 1965/1975.

14

before family planning programs began (1970 Census estimates plotted in dashed lines), and estimates to
the right of the vertical axis capture cohorts born after family planning programs began (1980 Census, solid
lines with markers). Dashed lines plot 95-percent, point-wise confidence intervals for this model. 24
Consistent with the resource and the selection effects operating as expected, Figure 2 shows that
cohorts born after federal family planning programs began had significantly higher household incomes.
Although the household income of birth cohorts was stable before family planning programs began, the
introduction of family planning programs corresponds to a notable trend break. Table 2 demonstrates the
robustness of these estimates to different control variables and mobility bias adjustments for the 1980
Census. Column 1 includes only county and year fixed effects, column 2 (our baseline model and preferred
specification) adds 850 state-by-year fixed effects (50 states *17 birth years), column 3 adds county-level
covariates, column 4 adds controls for abortion providers, and column 5 adjusts our baseline model for
mobility bias using Card and Krueger’s (1992) post-estimation correction. Across specifications, cohorts
born five years after the program began had household incomes that were very similar—2.7 percent higher
in our baseline specification (col. 2). Consistent with mobility attenuating our estimates, the Card and
Krueger (1992) mobility correction raises the estimate modestly to 3.0 percent (col. 5). In contrast, the
coefficients on household incomes among cohorts born up to six years before family planning programs
began exhibit little trend and are not statistically different from the year the county received its first family
planning grant. 25 Our baseline specification implies that the income of the average child was around $1,840
higher ($68,000 pre-program mean family income × 0.027) among children born after family planning
programs began. 26

24

For the interested reader, estimates for 1970 and additional robustness checks are presented in Online Appendix C.
Online appendices present all point estimates for the 1970 and 1980 Censuses, robustness checks, and the Card and
Krueger (1992) correction for mobility. These sensitivity checks do not alter the conclusions presented here.
26
This intention-to-treat estimate is not easy to rescale into a LATE (Imbens and Angrist 1994), because we do not
have an estimate of the first stage. If we could measure a first stage, it would include use of new methods like the Pill
(as in Table 1, panel B) as well as the more effective use of methods. Lapses in use or errors in use are an important
cause of unintended pregnancy even today. Forty-one percent of unintended pregnancies occur among women who
25

15

Because the restricted Census data are not top-coded, we also investigate the importance of outliers.
Trimming the top and bottom 1 percent of children’s household incomes, however, has little effect on these
estimates. 27 Another check using per-capita household income as a dependent variable shows that the
effects are even stronger after taking account of the number of people in the household in 1980: the average
child in cohorts born five years after the program began had a statistically significant 3.5 percent higher
per-capita household income (appendix table A5, col 2).
Increases in the income of the average child should be driven by households in the lower part of
the income distribution. As noted previously, eighty-three percent of family planning patients had incomes
below 150 percent of the poverty line. Consistent with this prediction, Figure 3 and Table 3 present evidence
of sharp reductions in measures of children’s economic disadvantage. To simplify the interpretation of the
coefficients, Figure 3 plots estimates of 𝜏𝜏 divided by the pre-treatment mean dependent variable for both
the 1970 and 1980 estimates. The series, therefore, denote changes in percent for each birth cohort indexed

relative to the year the family planning program began. Table 3 presents estimates in levels and also
summarizes the relevant pre-treatment means.
The results show that cohorts born 5 years after federal family planning programs began were 7.4
percent less likely to live in poverty (Figure 3A; Table 3, col. 1), 6.4 percent less likely to live below 1.5
times the poverty line (Table 3, col. 2), and 4.3 percent less likely to live below 2 times the poverty line
(Table 3, col. 3). As was the case with household income, Figure 3A shows no evidence that these
reductions reflect a pre-trend. These results are consistent with family planning programs having the largest
effects on lower income women.
Administrative statistics also suggest that nonwhite women were overrepresented among family
planning patients (30 percent of family planning patients versus only 17 percent of women of childbearing

are using contraception in the month they become pregnant (Sonfield et al. 2014). Effective use includes the continuity
of use which is not well measured in the NFS (or other modern fertility surveys).
27
Trimming the top and bottom 1 percent of incomes somewhat reduces the magnitude of the estimate at year +6 but
has a negligible effect on event years 4 and 5. One exception is event year −5 in 1970, where one child in a very small
county came from an extremely affluent family. This single observation inflated the estimate at event year −5 by 30
percent in the full sample over the trimmed sample.

16

age). This suggests that the intention-to-treat effects of family planning might be larger among nonwhite
children. Consistent with this prediction, Table 3 shows that the absolute reductions in poverty rates were
two times larger for the average nonwhite child born 5 years after the program began (-1.5, s.e. 1.6) than
the average white child (-0.8, s.e. 0.6). Owing to smaller samples, the event study estimates for subgroups
are imprecise. To increase precision, we summarize the event-study estimates in a standard differences-indifferences framework. Using a single dummy variable for the affected cohorts, we find that poverty rates
among non-white children fell by a statistically significant 5.5 percent (-2.0/34.8, s.e. 0.81, not reported in
tables for brevity) over the first six years after family planning programs began. For whites, poverty rates
fell by an insignificant 2 percent (-0.28/14, s.e. 0.29). For nonwhite children, the effects of family planning
programs are also generally larger for lower poverty thresholds, although imprecision limits strong
conclusions about comparisons across thresholds.
Of course, reductions in child poverty could occur mechanically if family planning reduced the
number of children in the household (which could lower the poverty threshold), even if household incomes
did not change (i.e., the resource effect is zero). 28 We, therefore, repeat our analysis by subtracting out the
younger siblings that arrived after each child was born and then reconstruct poverty thresholds for each
child at the time of birth. Notably, this lower threshold generates even larger reductions in poverty rates
attributable to family planning, suggesting that subsequent births in the household reduced the estimated
effects of family planning. This evidence foreshadows one of the paper’s main conclusions that the resource
effect plays an important role in explaining the improvement in children’s living circumstances.
The introduction of family planning programs is also associated with a reduction in another
measure of disadvantage: the share of children living in families receiving public assistance. Children born
5 years after family planning programs began were on average 12 percent less likely to live in households
receiving public assistance (Figure 3B, Table 4, col. 1) relative to those born just before family planning

Consider a family of two earning $18,000 in 2013: they would not fall below the federal poverty line of $15,500.
But, having a child at the same annual income would put the same family below the federal poverty threshold of
$19,530 for a family of three.
28

17

programs began. While the magnitude of the coefficients suggests that the reductions mainly occurred
among whites, the confidence intervals are too large to conclude that the effect of family planning on
receiving public assistance differs by race. White cohorts born 5 years after family planning programs began
were 10 percent less likely to live in households receiving public assistance (col. 2). Although a greater
share of non-white children lived in households receiving public assistance, the event-study estimates for
nonwhite children are much less precise and noisier, exhibiting both positive to negative-signed coefficients
(col. 3).
A final measure of children’s disadvantage is living in a household with a single head. Non-marital
childbearing and single headship rose dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s (McLanahan and Watson 2011,
Bailey et al. 2014), and both trends have served to increase child poverty over the longer-term. If family
planning programs encouraged these trends by reducing the cost of non-marital sex, they could have
increased non-marital childbearing (Akerlof et al. 1996). On the other hand, family planning programs
could have dampened the longer-term increase in non-marital childbearing due to the reduced unwanted
pregnancies among less committed couples.
Figure 3C shows evidence of the latter. Following the introduction of family planning programs,
the share of children born to single heads decreased. Although the 95-percent confidence intervals in figure
3C (Table 4, col. 4) include zero, a one-sided test rejects the hypothesis that the introduction of family
planning programs increased the share of children living with single parents. As in the case of public
assistance, these patterns are less noisy and more precisely estimated for white relative to nonwhite children
(Table 4, cols. 5 and 6). To investigate this result further, we conduct a complementary analysis of countylevel Vital Statistics for marriage and divorce. Using marriages and divorces per woman ages 15 to 44 as
the dependent variables in the same specification (and replacing cohort with year), we fail to reject that
marriage and divorce rates remained the same when family planning programs began (appendix figure A4).
Two final analyses help understand how family planning programs affected these outcomes. Using
both the age of mothers at the time of each birth and the number of each child’s older siblings (a measure

18

of each child’s birth order 29) as dependent variables, we find that age of the average child’s mother fell by
around 0.3 years by year 5, a reduction of 3.6 months (Table 5, col. 1). This finding is a weighted average
of the effects of family planning programs on childbearing delay (which should increase the age of the
average child’s mother) and women ending their childbearing careers sooner (often called stopping, which
should decrease the age of the average child). Although births to older women contribute relatively less to
the overall birth rate than births to younger women, the potential reduction in age by avoiding an unwanted
pregnancy in one’s thirties is much larger (e.g., 5 to 10 years on average) than the increase in age by delaying
a pregnancy (e.g., 1 to 3 years on average). On net, these opposing changes average out to a small negative
number, suggesting that the share-weighted reduction in age was slightly larger than the share-weighted
delay in birth.
The reduction in older siblings is also consistent with family planning programs helping older
women avoid unplanned births. Children born 5 years after family planning programs began had
significantly fewer older siblings, implying that they were more likely to be lower-order births (first or
second children rather than third or higher) (Table 5, col. 4). Evidence using changes in parity-specific birth
rates reinforces this impression. Bailey (2012: Table 4B) shows that family planning programs did not
affect first birth rates in the longer term (years 11 to 15), but they did reduce third parity births for up to 15
years after they were established—a result consistent with family planning programs affecting stopping
behavior. Changes in the living circumstances of the average child, therefore, appear to be driven by older
mothers having fewer children. Because wages tend to increase with age, this makes the income and poverty
results even more striking.
V.

A FRAMEWORK FOR BOUNDING THE IMPORTANCE OF SELECTION

To what extent do improved living circumstances for children born after family planning programs
began reflect the selection effect (i.e. reductions in childbearing among disadvantaged parents) or the
resource effect (i.e. increased investments by parents in their own human capital, careers, and partnerships)?

29

We calculate the number of older siblings in the household at the time of each child’s birth by subtracting out
younger siblings from those present in the household.

19

If only the selection effect operates, then the resources of the average child could rise even though the
resources available to any one child do not. This section develops a novel framework for bounding the
importance of selection, which allows us to approximate the resource effect. First, we show that empirical
estimates of the overall effect of family planning programs can be decomposed into the sum of the selection
and resource effects. Second, we use this decomposition to quantify the role of selection in raising the
income of the average child.
Let 𝑔𝑔(𝑦𝑦) ≥ 0 represent the empirical distribution of the number of children across household

income, y, before family planning programs began. We model income in discrete bins rather than as a
continuous variable to match how it is reported in Census data and for simplicity of exposition. Summing
over all households, ∑∞
𝑦𝑦=0 𝑔𝑔(𝑦𝑦) = 𝑁𝑁 is the total number of children and the household income of the

average child can be written as µ ≡

1

𝑁𝑁

∑∞
𝑦𝑦=0 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦(𝑦𝑦). The introduction of a family planning program may

change this average in two ways. First, selection may lower the number of children that lower income

families have. Let 𝑔𝑔 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 (𝑦𝑦) ≥ 0 capture the empirical distribution of the number of children by household

𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓
income in the context of a family planning program. Note, ∑∞
𝑦𝑦=0 𝑔𝑔 (𝑦𝑦) = 𝑀𝑀, where M<N and represents

the number of children in all households after family planning programs. The inequality is strict because

family planning programs strictly lower the number of children born. If family planning operated
exclusively via the selection effect, then µ0 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 ≡

1

𝑀𝑀

𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓
∑∞
𝑦𝑦=0 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔 (𝑦𝑦) >

1

𝑁𝑁

∑∞
𝑦𝑦=0 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦(𝑦𝑦) ≡ µ, as fewer children

were born to lower income families. Second, family planning programs may directly raise the incomes of
parents through the resource effect which we capture as ℎ(𝑦𝑦) ≥ 𝑦𝑦. This resource effect would further

increase the income of the average child, such that µ1 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 =

1

𝑀𝑀

𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓
𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓
∑∞
> µ.
𝑦𝑦=0 ℎ(𝑦𝑦)𝑔𝑔 �ℎ(𝑦𝑦)� > µ0

Our estimates, therefore, capture the treatment effects of family planning programs through both

the resource and selection channels, which we can write as follows:

On one hand, if we assume family planning programs do not have a direct resource effect (i.e. ℎ( 𝑦𝑦) = 𝑦𝑦),

the second part of the expression (the resource effect) becomes zero and the treatment effect represents
selection alone. On the other hand, if we assume the selection effect is zero (i.e. M=N and 𝑔𝑔 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 ( )=𝑔𝑔( )),

the treatment effect reflects only the resource effect.

We cannot estimate the selection effect directly. Instead, we use this equation to simulate the role
of selection and then bound the resource effect. Our approach uses the 1960 Census data and family
planning user characteristics from the 1970 NFS. We simulate two types of selection:

(1) “lower

truncation” which assumes that missing births were at the bottom of the income distribution, and (2) “likely
selection” which assumes missing births followed the observed empirical distribution of the users of family
planning services.
Table 6 presents the results from the bounding exercise. The first row of the table assumes the
selection effect is zero; by construction the resource effect explains the entirety of the estimated 2.75 percent
increase in children’s household income (unweighted average of effects for cohorts born 4 to 6 years after
family planning, col. 2 of Table 2).To simulate lower truncation, we drop the poorest 2 percent of children
from the 1960 Census which corresponds to Bailey’s (2012) estimates of the effect of family planning
programs on fertility rates. 31 This approach assumes that only the poorest parents use family planning

30

We obtain this result by adding and subtracting 𝑔𝑔(𝑦𝑦)ℎ(𝑦𝑦) and 𝑔𝑔(ℎ(𝑦𝑦))ℎ(𝑦𝑦). This approach is standard in
𝑁𝑁
𝑁𝑁
decompositions, the weighting of the selection and resource effects will vary with the choice of this cross-term.
31
We restrict our sample to the average age of children born 4 to 6 years after family planning programs started in
our 1960 sample (ages 5 to 7) of funded counties. This results in truncation of children with household incomes on
average below $3442 in 2013 dollars annually in the 1959 distribution of children’s household income. These
estimates correspond to Bailey (2012)’s weighted estimates averaged over event years 4 to 6 in Figure 6A and
unweighted estimates, model 3, in Figure 6B.

21

programs to avert births. 32 We simulate likely selection by assuming that missing births followed the
empirical distribution of household income for the users of family planning services. We fit a log normal
distribution to the household incomes reported by family planning patients in the 1970 NFS which results
in a distribution centered at the poverty line for a family of four ($23,636 annually in 2013 dollars in the
1960 Census) and a standard deviation corresponding to one quarter of the standard deviation in the
household incomes. We then remove a random 2 percent of children from the 1960 Census sample of
children ages 5 to 7 from this distribution so that the household income of the missing children corresponds
to the household income distribution of users of family planning programs. The result is that 81.4 percent
of averted children come from households with incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line, which
matches the poverty rate of family planning program users in administrative data (83 percent).
The second and third rows of Table 6 simulate the resource effects under lower truncation and
empirically likely selection. The 95-percent confidence intervals for the estimates are generated using a
non-parametric bootstrap procedure (Johnston and DiNardo 1997). 33 Selection by truncation generates a
1.84 percent increase in household income, accounting for around 67 percent (1.84/2.75) of the increase in
income of the average child, while the resource effect accounts for around 33 percent. The largest effect of
selection (implied by its upper confidence interval of 2.0) suggests that selection can explain at most 72
percent of the gains. If we also account for the uncertainty in the estimate of the increase in income,
however, we fail to reject that the resource effect could be zero and that the most extreme form of selection
explains the entire increase in household income.
Likely selection can explain around 36 percent (1 percentage point) of the estimated increase in
income of the average child. Our best estimate of the magnitude of the resource effect is that it accounts for

33
We generate 10,000,000 bootstrap draws of the pre- and simulated post-program household incomes of the average
child who is age 5 to 7 using the 1960 Census and take their difference. The resulting 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of
the 10,000,000 values of the difference represent the 95-percent confidence interval for the selection effect.

22

the remaining 64 percent (1.75/2.75) of the increase in child income. Taking account of the uncertainty in
the estimate of the increase in income as well as the simulated effect of selection, the lower 95-percent
confidence interval on the resource effect implies that it accounts for at least 16 percent of the income gains
to the average child. In short, the simulation rejects that the resource effect is zero under likely selection.
This finding underscores an important and understudied return to family planning programs: they may
directly raise parents’ income by encouraging parents to invest in their human capital, careers, and
partnerships.
VI.

FUNDING FAMILY PLANNING AS AN ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM

More than 50 years after the first family planning programs began in the United States, this paper
provides new evidence that they increased children’s economic resources and reduced child poverty. Using
a validated research design and large, restricted-use Census samples, we find that children born after a
federal family planning program began were 7 percent less likely to live in poverty and 12 percent less
likely to live in households receiving public assistance. A bounding exercise suggests that these increases
in the income of the average child were achieved through the sizable increases in the incomes of
disadvantaged parents—net of changes in selection. Our bounding exercise using the distribution of
incomes of family planning users shows that the direct effect of family planning programs on the incomes
of parents accounts for around 64 percent of the income gains for the average child. Although our data do
not allow us to establish the exact mechanisms for this effect, they are consistent with family planning
programs relaxing the constraints of unintended pregnancy and encouraging greater investments by parents
in their human capital, careers, and partnership decisions. To the extent there were spill-overs in services
to nearby counties, older siblings (who are part of our comparison group) benefitted, or parents’ geographic
mobility obscures our ability to measure the true effects, our results may understate the resource effects of
family planning programs on children’s economic resources.
The magnitudes of the estimated effects of family planning on income square well with others in
the literature. For instance, our bounding exercise suggests that family planning programs directly increased
the income of the average child by $1,200 (0.0275 × the average pre-family planning mean family income

23

of $68,000 in 2013 dollars × share due to the resource effect of family planning net of selection, or
1.75/2.75). Using Bastian and Michelmore’s (forthcoming) estimate that college completion should rise by
4.2 percent for every $1,000 increase in EITC income, our findings imply that college completion of
children born to parents with access to family planning should increase by around 5 percent. This estimate
is similar to the findings in Bailey (2013), who shows that the income and selection effects of family
planning programs together raised children’s likelihood of college graduation by 2 to 7 percent. 34
The magnitudes of these estimates also imply that the returns to family planning programs compare
favorably with other public policies aiming to increase the resources of disadvantaged children. In the 1960s
the federal government spent an average of around $278 million per year (2013 dollars) on family planning,
or $4.4 billion cumulating over 1964 to 1980 (the period considered in this analysis). Using our estimates
of likely selection, family planning programs directly reduced child poverty by 1 percent for just under $1
billion ($4.4 billion/(7*0.64), where 7 is the percent reduction in child poverty (Table 3) and 0.64 is the
share of each point attributable to the resource effect (Table 6, col. 3, likely selection).
Comparisons of the resource effects of family planning to other programs targeting child poverty
place these estimates in perspective. According to the supplemental poverty measure (SPM) for 2012,
TANF cost $10.24 billion in 2013 dollars and reduced child poverty rates by 2.7 percent (from 18.5 to 18.0
percent). Ignoring offsetting behavioral changes and deadweight loss, this implies that TANF reduced child
poverty by 1 percent for every $3.8 billion spent. Another useful comparison is the EITC. In 2012, the EITC
cost around $63 billion, and the 2012 SPM suggests that EITC and the refundable portion of the child tax
credit reduced child poverty rates by 27 percent (from 24.7 to 18.0 percent). A similar calculation implies
that EITC reduced child poverty by 1 percent for every $2.3 billion spent. In short, even when we ignore
the effect of family planning programs on public assistance outlays and through the selection channel, the

34

24

effects of family planning programs on parents’ incomes reduced child poverty at less than half of the cost
of the EITC and roughly one quarter of the cost of TANF. 35
These resource effects may translate into large and longer-term gains for children. For instance,
Dahl and Lochner (2012) use variation in EITC eligibility over time and find a 4 to 6 percent of a standard
deviation improvement in children’s test scores for each $1,000 of additional income. Milligan and Stabile’s
(2011) study of Canada’s child benefit programs and Chetty et al. (2014) study of U.S. tax credits find
comparable estimates. Aizer and Currie (2014) show that children receiving a 12 to 25 percent increase in
household income through the mother’s pension program in the early twentieth century went on to attain
about 0.4 years more schooling, had healthier weights in adulthood, earned about 14 percent more as adults,
and lived about one year longer. Consistent with this, Bailey (2013) provides suggestive evidence from
public Census data that cohorts born after family planning programs began were 2 percent more likely to
attain 16 or more years of education and had 1 percent higher family incomes as adults (see Schultz 2008
for a discussion of developing countries). Future work should investigate these longer-run linkages as well
as the intergenerational impact of family planning programs on the economy.

All estimates are for the baseline model. In columns 1-6, the number of observations and counties are identical to those reported Table 2. For columns 7-9, only
529 counties have sufficient numbers of nonwhites for inclusion. These estimates are based on 8,855 county-year observations. The samples of children in event
years -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for whites are 1,489,588; 1,448,089; 1,433,763; 1,428,864; 1,370,352; 1,325,507; 1,276,760; 1,237,436; and 1,214,314,
respectively. These sample sizes for nonwhites are 370,019; 365,304; 363,280; 365,009; 362, 757; 358,642; 356,818; 347,608; and 342,863, respectively. See

The results are very similar if we restrict the distribution of children’s household incomes to be positive. The
decomposition uses the cross-term in equation 4. The upper and lower 95-percent confidence intervals are
below each effect in brackets. In row 1 the confidence interval is calculated using the standard error of the
estimate. In rows 2 and 3 the confidence interval is calculated using the parametric bootstrap (Johnston and
DiNardo 1997). Source: Authors calculations using the restricted 1960 Census.
