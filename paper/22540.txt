Employment Effects of the ACA Medicaid Expansions
Pauline Leung and Alexandre Mas
NBER Working Paper No. 22540
August 2016
JEL No. H0,J0,J18
ABSTRACT
We examine whether the recent expansions in Medicaid from the Affordable Care Act reduced
“employment lock” among childless adults who were previously ineligible for public coverage.
We compare employment in states that chose to expand Medicaid versus those that chose not to
expand, before and after implementation. We find that although the expansion increased
Medicaid coverage by 3.0 percentage points among childless adults, there was no significant
impact on employment.

Introduction

In 2010, the United States passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), a landmark legislation that overhauled the nation’s existing healthcare system. A central debate around the implementation
of this act has been its effects on employment. Prior to the ACA, Americans primarily obtained health
insurance coverage through their employers, as individually purchased plans were often prohibitively expensive, and public insurance was limited only to certain segments of the population. As a result of this
system of employer-sponsored coverage, some have predicted that many individuals sought employment
purely to gain coverage. Several provisions of the new law, however, may loosen this “employment lock”
by providing alternative affordable coverage options.
One of the ways that the original law made health insurance accessible to low-income populations was
through a mandated expansion in the public means-tested Medicaid program to all those with incomes below
138 percent of the federal poverty line, starting in 2014. However, a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made
the expansion optional and left the decision up to the individual states. As of this writing, only 32 states
have elected to expand Medicaid. Since the program previously covered mostly families with children, the
expansions had the greatest impact on non-elderly low-income adults who do not have children under the
age of 18 (hereafter, “childless adults”). In states that did not expand Medicaid, most childless adults under
the federal poverty line are left without coverage; they are ineligible for Medicaid and are also excluded from
receiving the ACA’s refundable tax credits toward the purchase of private insurance, which are available to
workers above the poverty level.
In this paper, we ask whether the availability of Medicaid reduced “employment lock” among childless
adults. Although the long-term impacts of the Medicaid expansion, and health reform more generally, will
not be known for a few more years, one effect that should be apparent even at this early stage is whether
or not the introduction of public insurance allowed those who were locked into jobs for insurance reasons
to exit the labor force.1 In fact, as detailed below, several studies have demonstrated that the expansions
may have potentially large and immediate impacts on the labor market. To study this, we utilize state-level
differences in Medicaid availability due to the Supreme Court’s ruling. We compare the sources of health
insurance coverage and employment rates of states that expanded Medicaid relative to those that did not,
1 Although we focus on the impacts of Medicaid on the decision of whether or not to work (“employment lock”) rather than on
“job lock” due to a lack of data on job changes, there is evidence that the health reform may also lead to a reduction in job lock
more generally (Heim and Lurie, 2014).

1

before and after the policy was in place, in a differences-in-differences strategy. In contrast to previous
findings and predictions, we do not find any evidence of a reduction in employment lock in response to the
expansions of Medicaid.
The best existing evidence on employment lock among the population most affected by the Medicaid
expansions – low-income childless adults – come from two quasi-experimental studies and one experimental study of specific state programs that provide Medicaid or similar coverage to childless adults. The first
of these is Garthwaite et al. (2014), who examine the employment effects of a large disenrollment in Tennessee’s Medicaid program for the “uninsured and uninsurable” in 2005. Using a differences-in-differences
strategy, they estimate that Medicaid enrollment was associated with an over 50 percentage point drop in
employment. Dague et al. (2014) study a 2009 enrollment freeze in a Wisconsin public insurance program
and find smaller, but economically and statistically significant negative employment effects. They use both
regression discontinuity design and matched differences-in-differences strategies, and find that the employment drop from Medicaid coverage ranges from two to ten percentage points. Finally, Baicker et al. (2014)
find that when Oregon randomly selected childless adults to be eligible for Medicaid coverage, there were
no effects on employment. One explanation for the disparate results across states, supplied by both Baicker
et al. (2014) and Dague et al. (2014), is that Tennessee’s program covered relatively higher income individuals, who are more likely to be able to find jobs with health benefits. Another explanation is that worse
labor market conditions may affect the ability of individuals to adjust to health insurance losses or gains
through employment. Finally, it is also possible that the groups affected in each of the three states differed
in terms of how much they valued health insurance, and therefore how likely they were to be “locked” into
employment in the absence of Medicaid. In particular, since Oregon’s Medicaid program was only open to
those who did not recently have health insurance, those ultimately affected by the lottery would not have
been a group that was highly dependent on health insurance. On the other hand, as a result of earlier recertification procedures, the Tennessee disenrollees were likely a population that had greater than average
taste for coverage. In contemporaneous studies, Gooptu et al. (2016) and Kaestner et al. (2015) find limited
employment effects from the ACA Medicaid expansion.
Our study is also related to the literature on how public insurance expansions crowd out private insurance, since the primary source of private coverage is employer-sponsored coverage. The seminal paper on
this topic, Cutler and Gruber (1996), finds that when Medicaid eligibility was expanded for children in the
late 1980s to early 1990s, reductions in private coverage offset 49 percent of the increase in Medicaid cover2

age. Furthermore, they find that this private coverage is entirely employer-sponsored coverage, rather than
non-group private insurance. Later studies that have reexamined the same Medicaid expansions and subsequent policies for slightly higher income children generally find smaller crowdout effects, though estimates
cover a wide range (Shore-Sheppard, 2008, Card and Shore-Sheppard, 2004, LoSasso and Buchmueller,
2004, Gruber and Simon, 2008, Ham and Shore-Sheppard, 2005b). There has been considerably less work
examining the crowdout effects of expanding eligibility to adults, since there was very limited coverage for
adults prior to the ACA. Hamersma and Kim (2013), Busch and Duchovny (2005), and Aizer and Grogger (2003) find little to no crowdout of private coverage when examining the effects of parental Medicaid
expansions.
Finally, we distinguish our study from an earlier literature on the the labor supply effects of Medicaid for
single mothers, which mainly focuses on the effects of the decoupling of Medicaid from cash assistance in
the 1980s and early 1990s (Yelowitz, 1995, Ham and Shore-Sheppard, 2005a, and Meyer and Rosenbaum,
2001). The key question in these studies is whether raising the income threshold for Medicaid (from a lower
cash assistance income threshold) increased labor force participation among potential cash assistance recipients (i.e., single mothers) and abstracts away from the potential effect of Medicaid reducing employment
lock.2 In contrast, we focus on a population that, prior to the expansion, was not eligible for Medicaid
or comparable public coverage at any income level. Our estimates therefore should be unaffected by the
potentially offsetting impact of relaxing income constraints.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of the major
provisions of the ACA and the Medicaid expansions, as well as some background on the insurance landscape
prior to the reform. Sections 3 and 4 describe our data, sample, and empirical strategy. We present our results
in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.

Background on the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010 with the goal of providing near
universal health insurance coverage in the United States. Prior to the reform, publicly provided health insurance was generally available only to certain segments of the non-elderly population. State Medicaid
programs covered low-income families (mostly children), pregnant women, the blind, and the disabled. Pri2 An exception is Hamersma and Kim (2009), who explicitly examine the effects of parental Medicaid expansions on job mobility, finding that Medicaid reduces job lock among unmarried women.

vate insurance was primarily obtained through employment, though not all employees were offered this
coverage. Those who did not meet the criteria to qualify for public coverage, and who did not have access to
employer-sponsored plans often faced high coverage costs in the private individual market. The health reform sought to bring affordable coverage to these uninsured individuals through a combination of individual
and employer mandates, the introduction of premium subsidies and reduced cost plans, the establishment of
health insurance exchanges where individuals can shop for coverage, and the expansion of public programs.
Many of these provisions went into effect beginning in 2014, including the individual mandate, establishment of the exchanges, and the expansion of Medicaid programs. Indeed, as shown in Figure 1, our data
show an increase of about 10 million in the number of people insured from 2013 to 2014.
Originally, the ACA targeted the uninsured at the lower end of the income distribution by requiring states
that accept federal funding for Medicaid (currently, all states and the District of Columbia) to expand coverage to all individuals below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. Given that children at that income level
were already covered in all states, either by existing Medicaid programs or the Children’s Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), this expansion mainly affected adults, and in particular, those without dependent children
(“childless adults”). Those with incomes above 138 percent of the poverty line (up to 400 percent) would
be eligible for premium subsidies in the form of a refundable tax credit when purchasing private insurance.
Furthermore, those between 138-250 percent of poverty are eligible for plans with lower deductibles and
co-payments.
In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that requiring states to expand Medicaid was unconstitutional in
National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius. Instead, states may choose to expand
Medicaid, which was completely funded by the federal government starting in 2014, but will drop gradually
to 90 percent funding after 2019. Following the ruling, only about half of the states took up the expansion in
January 2014, and a handful more expanded later in 2014 and 2015. In states that did not expand Medicaid,
premium subsidies were available for those between 100 to 400 percent of poverty, but many adults below
poverty were left without affordable coverage options.
Prior to 2014, state Medicaid programs generally provided no coverage to the non-disabled, non-elderly
adult population, with several exceptions. The only group of healthy adults that states were required to
cover were very low-income parents of dependent children (typically with incomes well below poverty) and
those who were transitioning out of cash welfare programs. If states wanted to expand eligibility outside of
mandatory coverage groups, they had to receive approval for a “demonstration” waiver. Some states used
4

these waivers to offer coverage to childless adults, but since the programs were required to be budget neutral
to the federal government, the programs were generally limited in scope.3 According to surveys of state
officials conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Georgetown University, as of 2013, eight states
and the District of Columbia provided childless adults below certain income limits with Medicaid-equivalent
coverage (i.e., the same comprehensive benefits at no cost) (Heberlein et al., 2013a). An additional 13 states
provided a more limited package of benefits to low-income childless adults, though more than half of these
programs were closed to new enrollment.4
Therefore, when the ACA Medicaid expansions were implemented in 2014, it simultaneously granted
coverage to previously ineligible adults, while relaxing income limits for some who were already enrolled.
Since we are interested in isolating the labor supply effects of providing public health insurance (“employment lock” effects) from the potentially confounding effects of raising eligibility limits for existing enrollees,
our ideal sample includes only individuals who were not enrolled in Medicaid prior 2014. Since we do not
observe prior coverage in our data, our analysis will be limited to childless adults living in states that did not
have any Medicaid-equivalent coverage prior to 2014.5 We keep the states with more limited benefits in our
analysis, since it is unclear how accessible these programs were and whether they can be viewed as substitutes for employer-sponsored coverage. However, we probe the robustness of our results to the exclusion of
these states below.
To summarize, the upper panel of Table 1 lists the states without any Medicaid-equivalent coverage for
childless adults in 2013 that constitutes our main analysis sample, as well as their expansion status and date.
We also denote which states in this group had limited benefits to childless adults. The lower panel lists the
states that provided some childless adults with Medicaid-equivalent coverage and are therefore excluded
from our analysis.
3 The ACA also allowed states to begin covering childless adults beginning in April 2010, but the federal funding for this new
coverage group was limited to the state’s “regular” matching rate until 2014.
4 This number excludes states that provided coverage contingent on employment or other non-income requirement.
5 Focusing only on those who were previously ineligible for Medicaid also has the advantange of reducing any confounding
“woodwork” or “welcome mat” effects, which occurs when previously eligible individuals begin to take up Medicaid (“come out
of the woodwork”) following the reform due to increased outreach and advertising (Sommers and Epstein, 2011 and Frean et al.,
2016). To the extent that expansion states have larger “woodwork” effects, this may confound the interpretation of our employment
estimates.

Data

Our analysis utilizes data from the annual American Community Survey (ACS) and the monthly Current
Population Survey (CPS). Both surveys are nationally representative and contain labor market, health insurance, and demographic information. The ACS surveys a cross-sectional one-percent sample of U.S.
households every year. The CPS surveys about 60,000 households per month, interviewing them for four
consecutive months, followed by a break of eight months, and finally another four months. The ACS data
we use cover 2010-2014, and the CPS data cover 2010 through July 2015.
We draw our health insurance information from the ACS. Although the CPS also contains health insurance information in its annual March supplement, a redesign of the health insurance questions coinciding exactly with the timing of the Medicaid expansions renders it unusable for our purposes (Pascale,
2015). The specific health insurance variables from the ACS that we use are indicators for being covered
by the following types of insurance at the time of the survey: private insurance, private insurance through a
employer-sponsored group plan, private insurance that is directly purchased, and public insurance (Medicaid
or another government program for the low-income or disabled).
For labor market information, we use both ACS and CPS data. The ACS has the advantage of a larger
sample size, but the CPS contains more nuanced questions on labor force participation, as well as a slightly
longer time horizon post expansion. For both data sets, our main outcome variable is an indicator for being
“at work” in the survey reference week. For intensive margin measures of employment, we use the question
in the CPS that asks the worker for the number of actual hours worked in the reference week. Usual weekly
earnings are reported in the CPS for those who are employed and interviewed in their fourth and eighth
month in the survey. We measure wages by dividing weekly earnings by the number of usual hours worked
per week.
As mentioned above, prior to the expansion, all states covered low-income parents to some degree, and
several states also had programs that provided childless adults with Medicaid-equivalent coverage. To the
extent that adults who were enrolled in Medicaid prior to the expansion were limiting their labor supply
to stay under income thresholds, any evidence of employment lock would be confounded by workers who
increase their labor supply in response to the relaxed income limits in expansion states. We therefore focus
only on childless adults and restrict the sample to the 42 states in which there was no Medicaid-equivalent
coverage for childless adults in 2013. Later in the analysis, we probe the robustness of our results to includ-

6

ing only states without any public insurance for childless adults. We consider an individual childless if they
do not share a household with a child under 18. This definition of childless is likely to identify a subset of
the actual population of adults who are excluded from public insurance coverage pre-ACA, as households
with children may contain several families where only a subset of the adults qualify as parents or caregivers
according to state program rules. To avoid potential interactions with military, aged, and dependent health
coverage, we restrict our sample to non-institutionalized, civilian adults, ages 27-64.
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for childless adults in the expansion states and non-expansion states
in our sample. Expansion states have higher rates of coverage, mostly coming from employer-sponsored
coverage, though higher rates of Medicaid coverage also contribute to the disparity. In terms of employment
rates, however, the two sets of states look fairly similar, with employment in expansion states only slightly
higher. In terms of demographic differences, the non-expansion states tend to be on average less educated,
more likely to be non-white, and have a higher rate of poverty.
Since individuals with incomes above the federal poverty line (up to 400 percent of the poverty line)
would be eligible for premium subsidies beginning in 2014 regardless of whether they live in a state that
expanded Medicaid, the expansion will mostly impact those who are below the poverty line. We therefore
also focus on a subsample of childless adults who are below the poverty line. Since a poverty measure
is not readily available in the basic monthly CPS, we use the categorical variable on the total household
income, in conjunction with the number of household members, as a proxy. We define an individual as
below poverty if the upper threshold of their household income category is below the official poverty level
of the interview year, assuming the number of household members is the family size. As expected, this
understates the poverty rate: it is consistently about one percentage point below poverty rates obtained using
the ACS. However, the fraction of individuals below poverty using this measure tracks changes in the ACS’s
poverty rates fairly well over time (not shown).
Finally, for robustness, we estimate the effects of the Medicaid expansion in a few other subsamples
that utilize additional information available in the CPS. In one subsample, we take advantage of the short
panel structure of the CPS and identify individuals who were employed when surveyed in the previous year.
In linking the respondents over time, we follow Madrian and Lefgren (1999) and match by household and
person identifiers, and invalidating matches that do not have consistent sex, race, and age information. Using
this method, we are able to match about 77 percent of respondents who were in their fifth through eighth
month in the survey. In another subsample, we use self-reported health status information, which fall into
7

five mutually exclusive categories: excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor, from the Annual Social and
Economic Supplement of the CPS (the “March CPS”).

Empirical Strategy

To identify the effects of an expansion in Medicaid coverage, we compare employment in states that did and
did not expand Medicaid, before and after adoption of the policy. Specifically, we estimate differences-in
differences (DD) specifications of the following form:

yst = β Expst + αs + γt + εst

(1)

where yst are measures of insurance coverage and employment in state s and time t (where t is a month
in CPS samples, and a year in ACS samples), αs are a set of state fixed effects, and γt includes a set of
year fixed effects. When we have monthly data (i.e., in the CPS), γt also includes a set of calendar month
fixed effects to control for seasonal fluctuations in insurance or employment that are common in all states.
Expst is an indicator for whether state s covers childless adults under Medicaid in time t. In the ACS data,
which is available yearly through 2014, states will have at most one period in which Expst is equal to 1.6
In the monthly CPS analysis, for which we have data through July 2015, Expst will equal to 1 starting the
month the expansion is implemented. The coefficient of interest is β , which captures the effect of expanding
Medicaid.
We estimate the model on on data aggregated to state-year (ACS) or state-month (CPS) averages, and
weight each aggregate by the number of observations in each state-year or state-month cell. In the absence
of individually varying covariates, the weighted aggregate regression is identical to estimating using the
individual level data, up to a degrees-of-freedom adjustment.7 We choose to aggegate the data in this way
to highlight the fact that the effective unit of observation in the context of our quasi-experiment is the stateyear/month. In other words, if we observe more individuals in the states and years we already have in our
existing sample, we are not gaining any more variation in the regressor of interest, and the aggregate analysis
reflects this fact. However, more individual observations do reduce the variance of the estimated insurance

our base specification, we do not include any controls other than state and time fixed effects, though our results are robust
to controlling for the demographic composition of states (i.e., age, gender, race, education, and marital status), shown in Appendix
Tables 3 and 4.

coverage or employment rates for each cell. Thus, the weighting can be viewed as a heteroskedasticity
correction: Since state-year/month cells with more individuals have may have smaller error term variances,
weighting by the cell sizes may improve precision.8 All standard errors are clustered at the state level.
The identifying assumption is that the employment in expansion states and non-expansion states would
have trended similarly the absence of the Medicaid expansion. One way this would be violated is if only
states with strong or weak labor markets, and whose employment was on an upward or downward trajectory
prior to 2014, choose to take up the expansion. To gauge whether there were pre-existing trends in the
expansion states we replace Expst in equation (1) with a set of “event time” dummies:
1

yst =

∑

δk Dkst + αs + γt + εst

(2)

k=−3

where Dkst is equal to 1 if in time t, state s is in its kth year of its Medicaid expansion, and 0 otherwise. If
the outcome in the above equation is employment, the coefficients δk for k < 0 show whether, in the periods
leading up to the expansion, the expansion states had significantly different employment rates relative to the
control group.
In order to determine whether individuals reduced labor supply in response to the Medicaid availability
from equation (1), there must not have been any offsetting differential increases in labor demand in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. One provision of the ACA that is predicted to have impacts on
labor demand is the employer penalty, which penalizes large employers for not offering employer-sponsored
coverage beginning in 2015. Although all states are subject to this penalty, one way in which the penalty
may interact with the Medicaid expansion to impact labor demand is if the penalty is smaller in expansion
states. This is possible because the penalty is applied to an employer only if an employee claims a premium
tax credit, which may be less likely in states that expand Medicaid. To test this indirectly, we examine the
effects of the expansion on wages, which should increase if there were an offsetting increase in demand.
We note that in addition to the Medicaid expansions, the ACA established premium subsidies and health
insurance marketplaces in all states, which also had the potential to reduce employment lock. Our identification strategy, which compares states by expansion status, will therefore be unable to estimate the effect
of the health reform on employment lock more generally. Rather, we will only detect employment effects
8 Indeed, a modified Breusch-Pagan test that regresses OLS residuals on the inverse of cell sizes confirms the presence of
heteroskedasticity when the outcome is employment in our main ACS and CPS samples (Solon et al., 2015). In addition, we report
the estimates without weighting in Appendix Tables 3 and 4.

9

for a relatively low-income population whose incomes are not high enough to qualify for subsidies to purchase health insurance on the new exchanges. We therefore also estimate our models on low-income and
“Medicaid-likely” subsamples described below in Section 5.
Finally, it is also possible that because the premium subsidies are only available to those between 100 to
400 percent of the federal poverty line, workers in non-expansion states may increase their labor supply in
order to obtain subsidized private coverage. This effect works in same direction as the the employment lock
effects (i.e., non-expansion states would have relatively higher employment), biasing our results upward in
absolute value. For this reason, in some specifications, we estimate equation (1) on a sample of workers
who were previously employed.

Results

We begin by graphically examining insurance and employment trends in our sample of childless adults
in expansion states and non-expansion states. In Figures 2 and 3, we only include states that expanded in
January 2014 (17 states) and states that have not expanded (21 states), though our estimates will also include
the handful of states that expanded later than January 2014. Figure 2a shows that, as expected, Medicaid
coverage sharply increased in expansion states after 2014, while the increase was much milder in nonexpansion states. In Figure 2b, we plot overall coverage rates. In 2014, when several major provisions of the
ACA came into effect, including the individual mandate and the opening of the health insurance exchanges,
insurance rates in both expansion and non-expansion states increased, though the increase was larger in
expansion states. The magnitude of this difference is smaller than the difference in Medicaid coverage,
suggesting that individuals who were ineligible for Medicaid in non-expansion states were differentially
more likely to obtain private insurance via employment or through the newly established exchanges. When
we plot the annual employment rates in expansion and non-expansion states in Figure 3, however, there is no
evidence that employment in expansion states is lower than in non-expansion states.9 If anything, in states
that expanded Medicaid, employment may have increased.
In Table 3, we present our DD estimates of the effect of the Medicaid expansions on health coverage
9 The differences in employment rates and trends between the ACS and CPS data are likely due to the smaller sample sizes in
the CPS. In Appendix Figure 1, we compare the employment-to-population ratio (16+ year-old) estimated from the CPS and ACS
in expansion and non-expansion states to those obtained using the Current Employment Statistics (CES). Though we are unable to
compare the employment rates in our main sample (childless adults) to the employment rates in the CES, the trends in the CES
most closely match the ACS for the overall adult population. Note that the CES does not contain farm employment.

rates. Consistent with Figures 2 and 3, the first two columns of Panel A show that there was a significant difference in the fraction of childless adults insured and insured by Medicaid of 1.6 and 3.0 percentage points,
respectively, between expansion states and non-expansion states after the policy was in place. Column 3
confirms that a relative decrease in private insurance contributed to the smaller overall increase in insurance
coverage than implied by the increase in Medicaid coverage. In columns 4 and 5 we examine whether this
crowdout is coming from employer-sponsored group coverage. The point estimates indicate that the 3.0
percentage point increase in Medicaid coverage in expansion states is crowded out by a 0.9 percentage point
reduction in private direct purchase insurance, and 0.3 percentage point reduction in employer-sponsored
coverage, though the latter is statistically insignificant.
The total “crowdout” implied by our estimates is 42 percent, with about 11 percent coming from
employer-sponsored insurance and 31 percent from direct purchase insurance. These estimates are within
the range of estimates of crowdout during the Medicaid and CHIP expansions to low-income children (Cutler and Gruber, 1996, LoSasso and Buchmueller, 2004 and Gruber and Simon, 2008). However, we note that
it is somewhat misleading to relate previous measures of crowdout to the current setting, as many changes in
health policy and overall insurance coverage coincide with this particular Medicaid expansion. In past work,
the interpretation has been that expansions of public insurance led to some dropping of employer-sponsored
coverage among already insured individuals or dependents. Due to the individual mandate, as well as other
provisions in the ACA, the fraction insured increased sharply in 2014 for both expansion and non-expansion
states. The expansion in Medicaid was “crowded out” in the sense that, in the absence of Medicaid coverage,
some of the uninsured would have obtained coverage by purchasing insurance directly, perhaps through the
newly established state exchanges, where they can select from a menu of affordable coverage options.
Turning to our employment results in the first two columns of Table 4, we find a statistically insignificant
difference in employment rates in expansion states following the policy change. The point estimates from
the CPS data indicate that there may even have been a positive employment effect in expansion states.
In columns 3 and 4, we examine whether there were potential intensive margin responses to Medicaid
coverage. If employer-sponsored coverage is only available to full-time employees, we may expect the
Medicaid expansion to allow workers who previously worked full-time only to obtain health insurance to
switch to a better-matched part-time job. We do not find evidence that individuals are reducing their hours
worked following the Medicaid expansion: Part-time employment (those working fewer than 20 hours a
week) remained unchanged and full-time employment (those working 30 or more hours a week) may even
11

have increased. Finally, since the employment lock effect is only relevant for the employed, we estimate
employment effects among those who were employed in the prior year, using the CPS’s short longitudinal
structure. Column 5 shows that the expansion did not affect employment outflows.
In panels B and C of Tables 3 and 4, we present the analogous results for two subsamples of childless
adults who are more likely to be impacted by the Medicaid expansion. As mentioned above, since subsidies
for directly purchasing insurance are available for those above poverty in all states, employment lock among
higher income groups is expected to be reduced regardless of expansion status and would not be detected
by our DD strategy. We therefore examine the effects among those with incomes below the poverty line.
Panel B of Table 3 shows that, relative to all childless adults, the Medicaid expansion had a much larger
impact on the the overall insured rate among childless adults below poverty, increasing the rate of Medicaid
coverage by 11.1 percentage points and overall coverage by 7.9 percentage points. There is evidence of
some crowd out of both private employer-sponsored and direct purchase coverage of 1.0 and 2.0 percentage
points, respectively. When we examine the effects of the expansion on employment in Table 4, we again
find that there are no statistically significant effects on employment rates, nor any adjustment in labor supply
along the intensive margin.10
We note that restricting the sample to only those below poverty is problematic if the composition of
this groups differs in expansion and non-expansion states. In particular, workers may reduce labor supply
in order to qualify for Medicaid, resulting in an increased poverty rate in expansion states.11 In Panel C
of Tables 3 and 4 we therefore also show an alternative subsample containing a subset of childless adults
who are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid as predicted by fixed demographic characteristics. To
do this, we estimate a linear probability model of Medicaid enrollment, with household size, educational
attainment, age categories, sex, marital status, and race as predictors.12 We use the coefficients from this
model to predict the probability of being on Medicaid in both the ACS and CPS childless adult samples.
The “Medicaid likely” subsample shown in the bottom panels of Tables 3 and 4 are those who are above
the median in terms of their predicted Medicaid probabilities. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 show that the
first stage estimates of the Medicaid expansion on overall coverage (2.6 percentage points) and Medicaid
10 Although we are able to estimate and report the results on continued employment and wages in the last two columns, we note
that the estimates, especially in the below-poverty sample, suffer from small cell sizes.
11 We also estimate equation (1) with y as the fraction of the population below poverty in state s at time t, and present the
st
estimate of β in Appendix Table 1. The statistically insignificant negative coefficient indicates that increased rates of poverty in
response to the Medicaid expansion is unlikely confound our findings.

groups (8 dummies), sex, marital status (5 dummies), and race (2 dummies).

coverage (4.6 percentage points) are stronger in this subsample relative to all childless adults, as expected.
However, the (insignificant) employment effects are of roughly similar magnitudes (Table 4).
Using the estimates from column 2 of Table 3 and column 1 of Table 4, a 95 percent confidence interval
indicates that the implied “treatment effect on the treated” (TOT) of Medicaid on employment is no more
negative than 15 percentage points (from “Medicaid-likely” subsample). To put these numbers in context, we
compare our estimates with three recent studies on the impact of Medicaid on the labor supply of childless
adults. As mentioned in the introduction, the most compelling evidence we have so far on the potential
for the public insurance expansions in the ACA to reduce employment lock comes from states that have
recently stopped or started enrollment in public insurance programs for childless adults. Garthwaite et
al. (2014) examine a large disenrollment in Tennessee’s childless adult program in 2005 and find that 63
percent of those who lost Medicaid increased their labor supply, though the 95 percent confidence interval
ranges from about five percent to well over 100 percent.13 Dague et al. (2014) find much smaller but still
significant and precisely estimated employment effects ranging from 2.4 to 10.6 percentage points after an
enrollment freeze in Wisconsin’s childless adult program in 2009. Finally, Baicker et al. (2014)’s estimate
from the Oregon Health Experiment, where wait-listed childless adults were randomly invited to enroll in
the program, is that Medicaid reduced employment by 1.6 percentage points (statistically insignificant).
Our point estimates are closest to Baicker et al. (2014)’s small and insignificant point estimates, though our
estimates do not rule out the moderately sized effects that were found in Dague et al. (2014).
One possible explanation for the widely disparate findings in the state-specific case studies is that they
may be studying very different subpopulations. Employment lock would be most relevant for those who
highly value health insurance (i.e., those who are or who have dependents in poor health), and/or who
have relatively low labor force attachment. The population studied in Garthwaite et al. (2014) are exactly
those with higher than average taste for health insurance (due to earlier recertification reforms), while the
population studied in Baicker et al. (2014) are those who have gone without coverage for at least six months,
and may have lower than average taste for coverage. To see whether these differences across populations
may explain the different results, we estimate our models on subgroups of childless adults who are likely
to have larger employment responses to Medicaid coverage. First, we estimate the effects of the expansion
on those who tend to have lower labor market attachment: females, those age 50 or older, and high school
13 These

numbers use only the confidence interval on the reduced form effect on employment, and does not account for the
estimation of the first stage.

13

dropouts. Then, as a proxy for health insurance preferences, we also estimate the employment effects
among those with a self-reported health of poor, fair, or good (available in the March CPS only). The first
two panels of Table 5 show that the Medicaid expansions had similar effects on insurance coverage and
employment among females and older individuals as in the overall childless adult population. Among high
school dropouts, the expansions had a larger impact on Medicaid coverage, and there is also less evidence
of private insurance crowdout. Correspondingly, there is no evidence of employment effects. Finally, in
the last panel, we find no statistically significant employment effects among those with self-reported health
ranging from poor to good (about 38 percent of respondents).
A potential explanation for the zero to positive employment response is that expansion states experienced
a relative increase in labor demand. As mentioned above, since the ACA mandated that employers with over
50 full-time equivalent employees are required to provide group coverage and were penalized for every
worker who claims a premium tax credit (excluding the first 30), it is possible that employers in states
that expanded Medicaid anticipate lower labor costs because they are less likely to be penalized for lack of
coverage.14 We test for a possible increase in labor demand by examining the wage response in expansion
states, which should be positive if there were simultaneous increases in labor demand and decreases in labor
supply. In the last column of Table 4, we report the DD coefficient when we estimate equation (1) with the
average log wages as outcomes. We find no significant effects of the Medicaid expansion on wages.
As mentioned above, the validity of the differences-in-differences strategy for identifying a causal effect
of expanding Medicaid depends crucially on the idea that labor market trends were comparable in states
that expanded relative to those that did not. One particular concern is that states that expected upward
growth in employment are more likely to take up the Medicaid expansion, masking any employment lock
effects. We check to see whether expansion states were on a different employment trajectory prior to the
expansion by estimating equation (2) and plotting the estimates of δk in Appendix Figure 2. The statistically
insignificant estimates of the δk coefficients for k ≤ 0 and lack of visual pre-trends indicate that there were
no systematic differences between expansion states and non-expansion states in the periods leading up to
the policy change.
In Appendix Table 2, we probe the robustness of our results to the exclusion of certain states. First,
as we mention in Section 2, 13 states provided low-income childless adults with limited benefit plans prior
to 2014. Of these 13 states, 11 subsequently chose to expand coverage in 2014, as shown in Table 1. To
14 Note

that the employer mandate does not come into effect until the beginning of 2015.

14

the extent that the enrollees in these limited plans were previously constrained to work fewer hours due
to the low income thresholds, it is possible that the Medicaid expansions led to increased labor supply,
confounding the effects of employment lock. The upper panel of Appendix Table 2 shows the estimates of
our main DD specifications using excluding these 13 states. A second concern is that while most expansion
states implemented the policy at the beginning of 2014, a handful of states expanded later in the year and
in 2015. In states that expanded later, it is possible that the timing of the policy was determined by factors
related to the state’s economy and labor market. Therefore, in the lower panel of Appendix Table 2, we
include only the states that expanded in January of 2014 and non-expansion states.15 The results from both
of these alternative sample restrictions mirror the results from Table 4.

Conclusion

In this study, we examine whether the recent expansions in Medicaid reduced “employment lock” among
childless adults who were previously ineligible for public coverage. To do this, we use a differences-indifferences strategy that compares employment in states that chose to expand Medicaid versus those that
chose not to expand, before and after implementation. We find that although the expansion increased Medicaid coverage by 3.0 percentage points among childless adults, there was no significant impact on the
employment. Our estimates rule out the large employment lock effects of Garthwaite et al. (2014) and are
similar to that of Baicker et al. (2014).
We close with several potential explanations for the different estimates across studies. First, as noted by
both Baicker et al. (2014) and Dague et al. (2014), the population studied by Garthwaite et al. (2014) is a
higher income population than those most affected by the Medicaid expansions in the ACA. It is possible that
the types of jobs that individuals living below poverty are able to obtain are less likely to come with health
benefits. Another explanation is that the considerable policy uncertainty surrounding the ACA’s Medicaid
expansion may have dampened or delayed employment responses: If workers “locked” into employment for
insurance reasons perceive the Medicaid expansions to be temporary due to constitutional or implementation
challenges, they may be reluctant to leave their jobs and employer-sponsored insurance coverage. As the
dust settles, however, it is possible that we will begin to see the predicted impacts on the labor market.
15 This

excludes PA, NH, IN AK, and MI. We also exclude WI because while it did allow childless adults in Medicaid starting
in 2014, it is not considered technically expanded because the program is limited to those under 100 percent FPL and will not be
accepting the enhanced federal funding for childless adult coverage.

15

Therefore, while our early estimates suggest that the labor market impacts of the Medicaid expansions are
smaller than anticipated, medium- and long- term impacts remain an important avenue for future research.
