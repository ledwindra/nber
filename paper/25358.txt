ABSTRACT
Intertemporal tradeoffs play a key role in many personal decisions and policy questions. We
describe models of intertemporal choice, identify empirical regularities in choice, and pose new
questions for research. The focus for intertemporal choice research is no longer whether the
exponential discounted utility model is empirically accurate, but, instead, what models best
explain the robust behavioral deviations we observe. We introduce the term “present-focused
preferences” to describe the large class of models that prioritize present flows of experienced
utility. Present-focused preferences need not coincide with a preference for commitment or
dynamically inconsistent preferences. Present-bias is a special case of present-focused
preferences.

1. Introduction
Most decisions have consequences that play out over time. How much should I spend today and
how much should I save? How many hours should I work on a problem set tonight and what
work should I postpone? Should I have a candid conversation with an under-performing coworker or delay the awkward interaction? Is it worth getting out of bed to take my medicine, or
is it OK to skip a night? Should I exercise this afternoon, or check all of my social media
accounts today and exercise tomorrow?
Whether in the workplace, the marketplace, on vacation, or at home, almost all decisions have an
intertemporal dimension. If one makes these decisions with any foresight at all, it is necessary to
somehow weigh utility flows (i.e., costs and benefits) that occur at different points in time.
These questions also dominate many of our world’s leading policy questions. How much to
invest for the future is at the heart of myriad policy issues, including education, health,
retirement, energy and the environment.
For much of the twentieth century, the working model of intertemporal choice was the
(exponential) discounted utility model developed by Ramsey (1928) and Samuelson (1937),
which features time-separable utility flows that are exponentially discounted: i.e., utility flows
are discounted with the function 𝛿 , where 𝛿 is the discount factor and t is the horizon of the
utility flow. This framework has many things to recommend it, including parsimony,
generality/portability, and a single welfare criterion (which is implied by dynamically consistent
preferences).1 But the exponential discounting utility model is not descriptively accurate.
People seem to struggle when they make intertemporal tradeoffs, a phenomenon which has been
extensively discussed by moral philosophers, political economists, psychologists, and
policymakers. Writings about self-control and self-management are almost as old as written
language itself.2 As literature developed in the ancient world, the focus on self-control
intensified. Greek philosophy contains many analyses about the challenges and virtues of selfmanagement. Plato reports that Socrates described the soul as a charioteer (reason) with a pair of
horses, one “noble” and the other one unruly and difficult to control.3 Aristotle emphasized the
virtue of temperance and the human propensity to engage in self-defeating behaviors. “For moral
excellence is concerned with pleasures and pains; it is on account of the pleasure that we do bad
things and it is on account of the pain that we abstain from noble ones.” For Aristotle, an
intemperate person has an appetite for pleasant things and chooses them at the cost of other,
better things.4 Issues of self-control were explored by David Hume (“reason is the slave to the
passions”) and Adam Smith (who distinguished between self-defeating “passions” and farsighted “interests”).5 Much of the soft and hard paternalism reflected in the modern welfare state
For another early formal analysis of intertemporal choice, see Koopsman (1960).
For example, the ‘wisdom book’, The Maxims of Ptahhotep includes numerous recommendations for self-restraint.
This text was likely written during the Old Kingdom or the Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt (Fox, 1983, dates the
book to the 21 century BCE).

is an effort to influence intertemporal choices (e.g., see the discussion of Social Security in
Feldstein 1985).
While much of economics in the mid-twentieth century modeled individuals as having a clear
objective function and no self-control problems, research exploring self-control and
intertemporal choice has blossomed in recent decades. Important milestones include two
volumes published by the Russell Sage Foundation on intertemporal choice, edited respectively
by Loewenstein and Elster (1992) and Loewenstein, Read, and Baumeister (2003). For a highly
influential review of the development of the field see Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue
(2002). Subsequent reviews include Chabris et al (2010) and Sprenger (2015). Cohen et al
(2016) review the conceptual and methodological challenges associated with the measurement of
intertemporal preferences. Cohen et al also discuss relevant neuroimaging evidence, which we
completely omit from this current review.6
In this handbook chapter, we review the latest research on intertemporal choice and identify
important open questions for our understanding of human behavior. We begin (Section 2) by
examining formal models of intertemporal choice, because models provide a lens with which to
examine empirical evidence and help identify new questions to explore. Most models we review
share the unifying feature of giving some special priority to the present. To formalize the idea
that the present is qualitatively treated differently than other periods, we introduce a metacategory of models: present-focused preferences exist if agents are more likely in the present to
choose an action that generates immediate experienced utility, then they would be if all the
consequences of the actions in their choice set were delayed by the same amount of time. More
informally, this amounts to people choosing more impatiently for the present than they do for the
future.
We intentionally use the term present-focus, rather than the more common term present-bias,
because bias implies a prejudgment that the behavior is a mistake. Models that produce presentfocused preferences include: hyperbolic and quasi-hyperbolic discounting (i.e., models with
present bias); temptation that is experienced when choosing for now but not when choosing for
the future; an interaction between myopic and planner selves; objective counter-party risks; and
distortions in the perception of time or in forecasting the future. Present-focused preferences
serve as a meta-category that identifies key commonalities among most of the models in the
intertemporal choice literature. We also identify the key contrasts that differentiate the large
number of present-focused models. Specifically, in Section 2.7 we provide a table that
summarizes some of these differences.
In Section 3, we identify 10 key empirical regularities that have been well-documented in the
literature: high required rates of return for money, higher required rates of return for
consumption, preference reversals, procrastination, naiveté, large effect of transactions costs, a
demand for commitment, the existence of paternalistic policies, and a preference for improving
sequences. We accompany each of these 10 regularities with a closely related open question.

See Camerer et al (2015) for a related discussion of the literature on neuroeconomics.

1. Why do individuals have such a high required rate of return for money if impatience is
fundamentally about consumption flows rather than financial flows?
2. How substitutable is consumption (and effort) across time? How does the substitution
of consumption affect measured discount rates?
3. What are the key mechanisms that cause preference reversals?
4. Why do people underestimate their own procrastination? What are the relative roles of
naiveté about present-focus versus other explanations for underestimating
procrastination, such as overconfidence about the effort required and limited memory?
5. Why don’t people learn and anticipate their present-focused behavior? What can help
people correctly anticipate their future present-focused behavior?
6. Is the large effect of small transactions costs on behavior primarily related to present
focus, or is it some other channel?
7. Why do households have such low levels of liquid net wealth, relatively high levels of
illiquid net wealth, and high marginal propensities to consume out of liquid wealth
changes?
8. Why is pure commitment so rare in markets and why is willingness to pay for
commitment usually so low (even in lab experiments designed to measure the taste for
commitment)?
9. What welfare criterion should we use to evaluate intertemporal tradeoffs?
10. How do we integrate models of discounting with the other factors leading to a
preference for improving sequences? When does a preference for an improving
sequence become important relative to discounting?
In section 4 we present six more open questions:
11. How soon is “now”? How fast does value decline over time?
12. What types of decisions involve temptation? How quantitatively important is
temptation (as opposed to present-bias)?
13. How important are a variety of mechanisms for intertemporal choice, including
probability weighting, trust, and heuristics, both in the lab and in the field? What role
do alternative psychological conceptions play in intertemporal choice?
14. How stable are time preferences? How general are they across domains?
15. How malleable is time preference? How effective are self-management techniques?
16. Are households saving optimally for retirement?
Section five concludes.

2. Present-focused Preferences: Theoretical Commonalities
All animals, including humans, tend to pursue instant gratification, even when such immediate
rewards are obtained by foregoing a substantially larger amount of delayed gratification. In
section 3, we discuss both the qualitative and quantitative evidence (from the field and the lab)
for this empirical regularity. In the current section, we describe several related theoretical
frameworks that all generate a preference for immediate gratification. We focus on their
similarities and accordingly group these conceptual frameworks together into a category that we
call “present-focused preferences.”
Present-focused preferences exist if agents are more likely in the present to choose an action
that generates immediate experienced utility, then they would be if all the consequences of the
actions in their choice set were delayed by the same amount of time.7
Our definition compares an agent’s action in a situation in which they choose for the present to
one in which they choose for the future (in a binding way)—for instance suppose eating ice
cream delivered more immediate experienced utility than eating kale. Then, an agent displays
present-focus if when choosing for today, they choose ice cream over kale, but when choosing
for tomorrow, they choose kale over ice cream.
Circumstances that elicit such binding actions do not only arise in the laboratory or in artificial
environments (though binding choices are easier to create in a controlled environment). Consider
the person who tends to eat ice cream when it is immediately available, but tends to explicitly or
implicitly choose not to eat ice cream in the future by not putting ice cream into his shopping cart
at the supermarket.
Our definition of present-focused preferences refers to actions that generate immediate
experienced utility—for instance, eating your favorite food, relaxing with friends, creating art or
music, sexual activity, enjoyable hobbies, drinking alcohol, or recreational drug use.8 Increased
immediate experienced utility can be derived not only from engaging in pleasurable or gratifying
activities, but also by postponing activities that give immediate displeasure: consider a researcher
who postpones working on a referee report whenever she can, but agrees to write the referee
report in the first place (when the deadline is far away). In this example, the referee report
generates instant displeasure (e.g., reading the paper is a slog), but generates long-term benefits
(e.g., knowledge of the literature, or a reputation or self-image for being a good citizen).
Practical identification of activities that generate immediate experienced utility is conceptually
challenging but can be approached in multiple ways. First, one could ask people which activities
give them immediate pleasure, and even ask them to report that pleasure on a quantitative scale
(see Wertenbroch 1998, Field Study 1, and related conceptualizations in Dellavigna and
7
8

By “more likely”, we mean weakly more likely and at least in some contexts strictly more likely.
See Loewenstein (1996) for a related discussion of visceral drives.

Page 5

Malmendier 2004, 2006, and Oster and Morton 2005).9 Second, one could ask people which
activities give other people immediate pleasure, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Third, one
could measure willingness to pay for (marginal) experiences that only have immediate
consequences: e.g., the willingness to pay for eating ice cream normally vs. having the same
(unhealthy) ingredients safely ingested while one’s taste buds are numbed. Fourth, one could
measure neural activity during different activities and thereby identify activities that generate
immediate neural activation in pleasure circuits (e.g., with neural probes in non-human animals –
e.g., Schultz, Dayan, and Montague, 1997 – or with fMRI in humans – e.g., Rangel, Camerer,
and Montague, 2008; Hare, Camerer, and Rangel, 2009).
The definition of present-focused preferences is intentionally unconstrained with respected to the
nature/existence of self-control problems, issues that we will return to throughout this Section.
Moreover, even though present-focused preferences generate dynamically inconsistent choices—
that is, the choice between x and y made at date t for date 𝑡′ is different from the choice between
x and y at date 𝑡 -- they may result from dynamically consistent preferences (which we define
below). Preferences can be dynamically consistent even if choices are dynamically inconsistent.
A standard definition of dynamic consistency in preferences is as follows: Dynamic consistency
in preferences between dates 𝑡 and 𝑡
𝑡 arises when a person’s state contingent preferences
for actions taken at date 𝑡 , expressed at date t, are consistent with her state contingent
preferences for actions taken at date 𝑡′, expressed at date 𝑡′. Dynamic inconsistency in
preferences arises if there is any pair of values 𝑡 and 𝑡
𝑡, which is not characterized by
10
dynamic consistency in preferences. In this definition “state contingency” incorporates all
aspects of the choice. The state includes both internal phenomena like a twisted ankle (which
would make exercise difficult and suboptimal) as well as external constraints, like the absence of
a tempting good in a choice set. All of these contingencies are absorbed into the state
contingency referred to in the definition of dynamic consistency of preferences.
The question of whether preferences are dynamically consistent can be applied to a model. One
can ask what a particular model implies about the state-contingent preferences that are held at
date 𝑡 (for choices implemented at date 𝑡′) and compare them to the state-contingent preferences
that will be held at date 𝑡′. Likewise, the definition can be practically deployed as a series of
hypothetical questions asked at date 𝑡: “What would you like to choose at date 𝑡′ conditional on
state X, knowing that you are not binding yourself to this answer?”
As we will emphasize below, some theories that generate present-focused preferences feature
dynamically inconsistent preferences (e.g., present bias, which is discussed in Section 2.1).
However, other theories that generate present-focused preferences feature dynamically consistent
preferences (e.g., temptation models, which are discussed in Section 2.2).

9
See the large literature on subjective well-being, including experiments that triangulate choice data with selfreported data on tastes (e.g., Hare, Camerer, and Rangel 2009; Kahneman and Deaton 2010; and Stevenson and
Wolfers 2013). These measures have also been used in practical domains. For example, most hospitals now have
pain scales posted on the walls, so that patients can identify the level of discomfort that they are experiencing.
10
Some types of dynamic inconsistency arise in domains that are unrelated to time preferences (e.g., Andreoni,
Aydin, Barton, Bernheim, and Naecker 2016).

Page 6

We will also discuss the issue of commitment. Some theories that generate present-focused
preferences feature a taste for commitment: a strictly preferred restriction of one’s own future
choice set. Here we are interested only in the intra-personal taste for commitment – e.g., a
smoker who is trying to quit and chooses to flush her cigarettes down the toilet. We exclude any
inter-personal strategic reasons for commitment – e.g., a general who burns a bridge behind her
army, signaling to the opposing forces that her soldiers will fight to the death now that retreat is
not an option. In this chapter, when we discuss the phenomenon of commitment we refer
exclusively to the taste for (or choice of) commitment that arises from pure, intra-personal
mechanisms.
We conclude the chapter by presenting a 2×2 table, which reviews all of the theories of presentfocused preferences and organizes them along two dimensions: dynamic consistency of
preferences and a taste for commitment. We will end up filling all four boxes with theories that
fall under the broad rubric of present-focused preferences. We first discuss these theories in
isolation, before drawing them together at the end of section two.

2.1.

Present-biased preferences

The name present-focused preferences is a variation (and generalization) of the concept of
present-biased preferences. Present-focused preferences include both present-biased preferences
and many other related models. Present-biased preferences are the most commonly used
intertemporal choice model in behavioral economics, so we describe it first.
Present bias (Laibson 1997, O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999) is also referred to as quasi-hyperbolic
discounting, which highlights its intellectual debt to the earlier literature on hyperbolic
discounting (e.g., Loewenstein and Prelec 1992).11 Present-biased preferences are expressed:
𝑈

𝑢

𝛽𝛿𝑢

𝛽𝛿 𝑢

𝛽𝛿 𝑢

⋯ .

(1)

Here 𝑈 is total utility, 𝑢 is flow utility in period t, 𝛽 is the present bias parameter, and 𝛿 is the
long-run discount factor. Phelps and Pollak (1968) first used this framework to model
intergenerational preferences, in contrast to the intra-personal preferences that we discuss now.
For Phelps and Pollak, 𝑢 is the utility of generation t and 𝑢
is the utility of generation t+1. In
the behavioral economics literature, the discounting is intra-personal instead of being intergenerational. Accordingly, 𝑢 is the utility flow that an agent experiences during period t and
𝑢
is the utility flow that the same agent experiences during period t+1.
In this framework (like most other intertemporal choice models in economics) the object being
discounted is a stream of utility flows, which are distinct, in principle, from financial flows. In
other words, the theory is about how agents discount pleasures and pains experienced at
particular points in time, and not about how agents think about the timing of financial events
For earlier examples from the psychology literature, see Herrnstein (1961) and Ainslie (1974). For a different, but
conceptually related functional form, see Benhabib, Bisin, and Schotter (2010). For a closely related formulation
based on salience, see Akerlof (1991).

(e.g., whether my fully anticipated paycheck is auto-deposited in my bank account on Friday or
Monday -- assuming that the interest rate is zero and my short-term liquidity is more than
adequate to cover all of my expenses and other transactions over the weekend). The distinction
between utility discounting and money discounting is reviewed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, as well
as in Cohen et al (2016). To our knowledge this distinction was first clearly articulated by
Ramsey (1928): “This rate of discounting future utilities must, of course, be distinguished from
the rate of discounting future sums of money. If I can borrow or lend at a rate r I must
necessarily be equally pleased with an extra £1 now and an extra £(1 + r) in a year's time, since I
could always exchange the one for the other. My marginal rate of discount for money is,
therefore, necessarily r, but my rate of discount for utility may be quite different, since the
marginal utility of money to me may be varying by my increasing or decreasing my expenditure
as time goes on.”
To illustrate the importance of the timing of utility flows, consider the example of exercise (e.g.,
gym attendance). In most applications, exercise is assumed to have immediate logistical, and
psychic costs and delayed health benefits (e.g., DellaVigna and Malmendier 2004, 2006), which
will engender a self-defeating pattern of low levels of exercise, even among those who pay for
gym memberships. However, the opposite self-regulation problem might apply to people who
greatly enjoy the physical sensation of exercising. These presumably rare types will tend to
exercise too much, for the same reasons (in the model) that the rest of us watch too much
television and eat too many donuts. Modelers need to be careful in the assumptions that they
make about the timing of utility flows (for example, see the related analysis in Augenblick,
Niederle and Sprenger, 2015) and the valence of utility flows.
In this model it is natural to place bounds on the discounting parameters: 0 𝛽 1 and 0
𝛿 1. In the literature, the notation distinguishes the term ‘discount factor’, which refers to a
specific weighting parameter 𝛽 or 𝛿, and ‘discount function’, which refers to the function of
horizon-dependent utility weights, which, for present-biased preferences, is given by
1
𝛽𝛿

𝐷 𝑡

𝑖𝑓
𝑖𝑓

𝑡
𝑡

0
1

.

(2)

In Equations (1) and (2), 𝛽 is not exponentiated (whereas 𝛿 is). Because of this difference, it is
helpful to rewrite these preferences as
𝑈

𝑢

𝛽 𝛿𝑢

𝛿 𝑢

𝛿 𝑢

⋯ .

(3)

Written this way, it is clear that present biased preferences embed a continuation payoff stream
that is weighted by 𝛽 and then exponentially discounted thereafter. When 𝛽 1 these
preferences revert to exponential discounting. (As a general point, it is useful when behavioral
models nest the classical model as a special case.) In typical calibration/estimation of these
discounting factors, 𝛽 ≪ 1 and 𝛿 ≅ 1.
Present-biased preferences are present-focused. Under present-biased preferences, 𝛽 1
engenders a preference to experience pleasurable activities in the present instead of the future.
For example, assume that exercise has an immediate cost of c and a delayed (health) benefit of b.

Page 8

Assume that all of these utility flows are differences relative to an alternative activity which we
will call napping. To further simplify this example, assume that 𝛿 1. If 𝑏 𝑐 𝛽𝑏, then the
present-biased agent prefers to nap today and to commit to exercise tomorrow:
–𝑐
𝛽

𝛽𝑏
𝑐

𝑏

0,
0.

Present-biased preferences are dynamically inconsistent: e.g., in this example, the agent at time t
prefers to exercise at time 𝑡
𝑡 and the agent at time 𝑡 prefers to nap at time 𝑡 .
Present-biased preferences engender a (potential) preference for commitment if the agent has
sophisticated or partially sophisticated beliefs (see Strotz 1955, Phelps and Pollak 1968, Laibson
1997, and O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999; however, see Laibson 2015 for reasons that
commitment might still not arise in practice even for partially or fully sophisticated agents).
Sophisticated beliefs imply that the agent has a correct theory of her own future time preferences.
Partially sophisticated beliefs (i.e., partially naïve beliefs) imply that she recognizes that she is
present-biased, but she believes that her future selves 𝑡
𝑡 will each have a higher value of
𝛽 then those future selves will actually have 𝛽 𝑡′
𝐸 𝛽 𝑡′
1 (O’Donoghue and Rabin
1999). In the literature, 𝛽 is used as a short-hand for 𝐸 𝛽 𝑡′ . Fully naïve beliefs imply that
the agent believes that her future selves will not be present biased at all: 𝛽
1. Accordingly,
fully naïve beliefs imply that a present-biased agent won’t have a preference for commitment.
She believes that all future selves will act according to her current preferences for their future
actions.
Present-biased preferences are a special case within a large class of discounting models that are
distinguished by high discount rates in the short-run and low discount-rates in the long-run – i.e.,
, a monotonically falling discount rate (see Strotz 1955). The discount rate is the local rate of
decline in the discount function, 𝐷 𝑡 . In discrete time models, the local rate of decline of the
discount function (per unit of time) is
𝐷 𝑡

1
𝐷 𝑡
.
𝐷 𝑡

4

In continuous time models (with differentiable discount functions), the local rate of decline of
the discount function is
𝐷 𝑡
.
𝐷 𝑡

5

Under exponential discounting, the discrete-time discount rate is 1 𝛿 and the continuous-time
discount rate is ln 𝛿 1 𝛿.12 These discount rates are constant, and therefore not horizon
dependent.
12

This approximation represents a first-order Taylor expansion.
Page 9

Contrast this with the case of present bias. Under present-biased discounting in discrete time, the
short-run discount rate is 1 𝛽𝛿 and the long-run discount rate is 1 𝛿 1 𝛽𝛿.
There are also generalizations of present-bias in continuous time, which we omit in this short
survey (see Harris and Laibson (2012). Continuous-time implementations generate desirable
modelling properties, like smooth policy functions, equilibrium uniqueness, and—like the
exponential discounting model—e a single value function that the individual uses to judge their
own welfare.

2.2.

Unitary-self models with temptation

Present-biased preferences induce dynamically inconsistent preferences. As such preferences
began to gain influence in the 1990s, some economists pointed out that many of the phenomena
that were being explained by models with dynamically inconsistent preferences, could also be
explained by models with rational beliefs and dynamically consistent preferences (e.g., Dekel,
Lipman and Rustichini, 2001; Gul and Pesendorfer, 2001; Laibson 2001; Bernheim and Rangel,
2004; Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini, 2009; Gul and Pesendorfer, 2004; Noor, 2007; Noor, 2011;
Lipman and Pesendorfer, 2013). Some of these unitary-self models are called temptation
models. (A related psychology literature also studies temptation effects: e.g., Baumeister et al,
1998; Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998; Muraven and Baumeister, 2000.) Present-biased
models also feature temptation properties, though the nature of the temptation is different, as we
will explain below.
Unitary-self models of self-control problems come in many different particular forms. They are
related by the principle that choice sets affect utility, including the options that are not chosen
(see Kreps, 1979). Consider an example in which a decision-maker at time t can, in principle,
engage in two mutually exclusive activities during a future period 𝑡
𝑡: exercise or nap.
Assume that exercise has immediate consequences that are hedonically aversive, and therefore
exercise is not tempting. By contrast, assume that nap has immediate consequences that are
pleasurable, and therefore nap is tempting. Suppose that the decision-maker must choose her
choice set for period 𝑡 during t. At period t, the decision-maker has preferences over three
possible choice sets for period 𝑡 : {exercise, nap}, {exercise}, {nap}. A singleton choice set
implies that the decision-maker must choose that action (there is no opt-out).
Two scenarios illustrate some of the key ideas in this literature: “commitment with strong
temptation” and “commitment with weak temptation.” For all of the analysis in this subsection,
we will assume that there is no risk/uncertainty, thereby removing the classical option-value
reason for preferring flexibility (however, see Kreps 1979, for an alternative framework in which
agents have a preference for flexibility for its own sake).
Commitment with strong temptation: The period t preferences over choice sets available at time
𝑡 , could take the following form:
{exercise} ≻{exercise, nap} ~ {nap}.

(6)

Page 10

To simplify exposition, we underline the outcome that occurs at period 𝑡 conditional on each
choice set that could be chosen in period t. In this scenario, during period t the decision-maker
prefers that at period 𝑡 she will exercise without the temptation to nap. Therefore, she chooses
to tie her own hands by compelling herself to exercise at time 𝑡 . If the choice set {exercise,
nap} were available at period 𝑡 , then nap would be chosen (because nap is the tempting option
and, in the current scenario, this temptation is strong). Consequently, at time period 0, the agent
is indifferent between the (future) choice sets {exercise, nap}, which will induce the tempting
action of napping, and the restrictive choice set {nap}. In either case, she’ll nap. (This is the
same type of temptation that emerges in the model of present bias.)
Commitment with weak temptation: The period 𝑡 preferences over choice sets available at time
𝑡 , could take the following form:
{exercise} ≻ {exercise, nap} ≻ {nap}.

(7)

At date 𝑡, the decision-maker prefers that at time 𝑡 she will exercise without the temptation to
nap (as before). Therefore, she chooses to tie her own hands by compelling herself to exercise at
time 𝑡 . If the choice set {exercise, nap} were available at time period 𝑡 , then exercise would
still be chosen. Even though nap is the tempting option, this temptation is weak, so exercise
would still be chosen at period 𝑡 . But the agent does pay some utility cost when she rejects a
tempting option that is in her immediate choice set, so at date 𝑡, equation (7) feature two strict
inequalities, reflecting the costs of temptation.
In these analyses, temptation plays two roles. First, it can affect the final choice, as it does in the
first example (strong temptation). The availability of the option to nap causes nap to be chosen
in period 𝑡 (even though it is preferred to remove that option during period 𝑡 so it isn’t in the
consideration set at period 𝑡 ).
Second, temptation can affect welfare, even when it does not affect the final choice. In the
second example (weak temptation), exercise is chosen whenever it is available. However, the
decision-maker still strictly prefers to remove nap from her choice set. In this scenario, nap is a
temptation that makes the decision-maker worse off, even though she never chooses it when
exercise is available. Intuitively, it is psychologically costly to resist a temptation.13
Let’s now generalize this example. Consider an agent at time t who has two immediate choices
to make from unrestricted choice sets: do I choose to exercise or nap at time t and do I choose
(now at time t) to exercise or nap at time 𝑡′. The choices made at time t for time 𝑡′ will be
implemented by choosing singleton choice sets for time 𝑡′, thereby committing actions at time 𝑡′.

Though rarely discussed, temptation effects could, in principle, have effects opposite in sign to those discussed in
this subsection. If a decision-maker takes pride/pleasure in successfully resisting temptations, then a third case
could arise. Self-satisfaction when resisting temptation: The period 0 preferences over choice sets available at time
1, could take the following form: {exercise, nap} ≻ {exercise} ≻ {nap}. At date 0, the decision-maker prefers that
at time 1 she will exercise and she foresees that she will take extra pleasure in exercising if she does so by using her
own willpower, instead of relying on an extrinsic commitment mechanism. See Kreps (1979).

Under strong temptation, the agent will choose to nap at time t and will commit to exercise at
time 𝑡′, implying that these preferences are present-focused.
Under weak temptation, the agent will choose to exercise at time t and will also commit to
exercise at time 𝑡′. Moreover, at time t, the agent will strictly prefer (i.e., she is willing to pay) to
restrict her choice set at time 𝑡′, even though this commitment does not affect her choice at time
𝑡′. This phenomenon – willingness to pay for commitments that do not actually affect one’s
choices – is not predicted by present-biased preferences (see 4.2 for evidence of such
commitments). Present-biased agents may be willing to pay for commitment, but only if that
commitment changes their choices.
Summing up, the unitary-self model with temptation features dynamically consistent preferences
(all selves have aligned state-contingent preferences, where the contingency includes the relevant
choice set). The unitary-self model also features commitment, unless the agent is naïve about her
preferences (e.g., see Ahn, Iijima, and Sarver 2017).

2.3.

Multiple-self models with simultaneous selves.

A different branch of present-focused models is based on the idea that competing sets of interests
simultaneously pull the decision-maker in different directions (e.g, Thaler and Shefrin 1981;
Shefrin and Thaler, 1988; Hoch and Loewenstein 1991; Loewenstein, 1996; Bernheim and
Rangel, 2004; Loewenstein and O’Donoghue, 2004; McClure et al 2004, 2007; Fudenberg and
Levine, 2006, 2011, 2012; Brocas and Carrillo, 2008a, 2008b, 2012; Jackson and Yariv, 2014,
2015).
This conceptualization of simultaneously competing internal interests can be traced back to
Greek philosophers and probably has even earlier precedents. In the field of economics, the idea
originates with Smith (1759),14 who adopted a framework that echoed classical sources with
which he would have been familiar (e.g., Plato’s discussion of Socrates, referenced in the
introduction). Smith contrasted two sets of motivational systems: passions, which tend to be
myopic, and a far-sighted internal spectator who attempts to rein in the free expression of our
passions. “The spectator does not feel the solicitations of our present appetites. To him the
pleasure which we are to enjoy a week hence, or a year hence, is just as interesting as that which
we are to enjoy this moment.” Related models reappeared in the economics literature with the
contributions of Thaler and Shefrin (1981) and Shefrin and Thaler (1988). They hypothesized
competition between a myopic “doer” and a far-sighted (and dynamically consistent) “planner.”
Subsequent contributions (e.g., Fudenberg and Levine 2006, 2011, 2012) have used formal
frameworks that populate a middle-ground between the planner-doer model of Thaler and
Shefrin and the unitary-self models described in the previous subsection.15

See Ashraf, Camerer, and Loewenstein (2005) for a fascinating review of the rich veins of behavioral economics
that can be found in the work of Adam Smith, especially The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759).
15
“While we find the language of multiple ‘selves’ to be suggestive, the model can equally well be interpreted as
describing the behavior of a single ‘self’ whose overall behavior is determined by the interaction of two subsystems”
(Fudenberg and Levine, 2006, p. 1450).
14

Page 12

Fudenberg and Levine begin their 2006 paper with a quote from McIntosh (1969): “The idea of
self-control is paradoxical unless it is assumed that the psyche contains more than one energy
system, and that these energy systems have some degree of independence from each other.”
Fudenberg and Levine model two types of selves that play a repeated stage game: a patient
(dynamically consistent) long-run self and a sequence of myopic short-run selves. These two
types of selves share the same preferences over the immediate outcomes of each current stagegame. However, only the long-run self cares about payoffs in future stage games. Fudenberg and
Levine assume that each stage game is played in two phases. In the first sub-period of the phase
game, the long-run self chooses to exert a level of (costly) self-control that influences the
preferences of the current short-run self. In the second sub-period of the stage game, the shortrun self takes the final decision.
Models with simultaneously competing selves also fit into the general class of present-focused
models. Here too, (unconstrained) agents are relatively more likely to choose hedonically
pleasurable activities for the present, then they are to commit to choose the same hedonically
pleasurable activities for the future. For example, in the model of Fudenberg and Levine, the
current short-run self wants to experience immediate pleasures, making it difficult (i.e., costly)
for the long-run self to dictate the outcome. In equilibrium, unconstrained choices for the
present will be biased toward immediate gratification because the long-run self won’t be willing
to exert enough costly self-control to force the hand of the myopic short-run self. However,
when the same person makes binding commitments for the future, the current short-run self
doesn’t care about what will happen, so it can be easily manipulated by the long-run self.
Accordingly, choices made for the future will be less prone to favor short-run pleasures.
Multiple-self models with simultaneous selves feature a preference for commitment. The longrun self typically wants to restrict future choice sets to make it easier to resist the drives of future
short-run selves.
It is unclear how to categorize multiple-self models with simultaneous selves with respect to the
property of dynamic consistency of preferences. The long-run selves in these models are
(usually) dynamically consistent in their preferences. The long-run selves may appear to be
dynamically inconsistent because of their fraught interactions with their myopic selves. The
myopic short-run selves create drives that the long-run selves need to resist or, if that is very
costly, accept. Once one properly accounts for these myopic psychological drives, and the
psychic costs that must be paid to overcome them, the long-run selves have dynamically
consistent preferences (just like the unitary self in the temptation models).
Nevertheless, it would be odd to say that the full set of preferences is dynamically consistent in
multiple-self models with simultaneous selves. These models feature competing preferences
(e.g., the preferences of long-run and short-run selves), which are not aligned.

2.4.

Objective risks that reduce future value

Objective risks can create another source of present-focused preferences. Assume that
future rewards may be ‘lost’ before they are received – e.g., the counter-party making the
promise of the future payment could go bankrupt or skip town. If the hazard rate of such losses is
Page 13

horizon dependent, ρ(τ), then a perfectly patient decision-maker should discount rewards at rate
ρ(τ) at horizon τ. If this hazard is constant, discounting will appear exponential, but a changing
hazard can generate discount functions with a hyperbolic shape (see Sozou 1998; Azfar 1999;
Weitzman 2001; Halevy 2005; Dasgupta and Maskin 2005; Fernández-Villaverde and Mukherji
2006; Halevy 2014, 2015).
Hyperbolic discounting can be generated by uncertainty about what the hazard rate is (even if it
is a constant rate). For instance, Sozou (1998), Azfar (1999), and Weitzman (2001) assume that
ρ(τ) is not horizon-dependent, so ρ(τ) is a constant, and ρ is not known because it has been drawn
from a distribution. Consequently, at every point in time the true (realized) value of ρ has a
posterior distribution that is changing. The more time that passes without a loss, the more likely
that one of the low values for ρ was originally drawn. This generates intertemporal choices that
are equivalent to those that would be generated by a discount rate that declines as the horizon
increases (e.g., hyperbolic discounting).16
This is another example of present-focused preferences arising from an agent whose preferences
are dynamically consistent. In this scenario, the agent will look as if she has hyperbolic time
preferences (in the sense that her discount rate is declining with the horizon), but she won’t have
a self-control problem, she won’t have dynamically inconsistent preferences, and she won’t view
commitment as something valuable. She will always prefer more choice to less (all else equal).
This is an illustration of a more general point: exponential discounting is sufficient, but not
necessary for dynamically consistent preferences. If all selves agree on the same (nonstationary) non-exponential discount function, then they will have dynamically consistent
preferences.

2.5.

Models with psychometric distortions

Models with psychometric distortions posit that time and risk are perceived with psychological
distortions that tend to generate present-focused preferences. For example, suppose time is
perceived with a concave (subjective) transformation (as argued by Read 2001, Takahashi 2005,
Ebert and Prelec 2007, and Zauberman et al. 2009). To fix ideas, suppose that agents discount
with an exponential discount function, 𝐷 𝜏 𝑡
𝛿 , but that they perceive objective time, t,
with a concave transformation 𝜏 𝑡 . Then the discount rate inferred by the social scientist (with
respect to objective time), will be given by
𝐷′ 𝜏 𝑡
𝐷 𝜏 𝑡

𝜏′ 𝑡

ln 𝛿 𝜏′ 𝑡 .

Note that when 𝜏′ 𝑡
1, so that subjective and objective slopes align, the researcher will
simply impute a constant discount rate, ln 𝛿. However, if τ is a concave function, the imputed
Dasgupta and Maskin (2005) show that while Souzou’s model cannot explain preference reversals, uncertainty
about when payoffs will be realized can.
16

Page 14

discount rate is declining as the objective horizon, t, increases. To see this, take the derivative of
the imputed discount rate with respect to the discounting horizon:
𝑑

ln 𝛿 𝜏′ 𝑡
𝑑𝑡

ln 𝛿 𝜏′′ 𝑡

0.

Hence, the agent’s psychometric distortion in the perception of time produces behavior that
mimics the behavior that one observes when the discount function has a declining discount rate
in the (objective) horizon of the discounted reward. Relatively high short-run (effective)
discount rates and relatively low long-run (effective) discount rates generate present-focused
preferences for the same reasons that we see them in section 2.1.
This mechanism is one microfoundation for hyperbolic discounting. However, this version of
hyperbolic discounting is different from the one implied by present bias. For example, this
psychometric distortion does not seem to imply a motive for commitment. Rather a
psychometrically distorted view of the future is like an optical illusion. When you become aware
of the optical illusion, you try to correct your misperception (i.e., make some effort at debiasing),
rather than restricting your future choice sets. On the other hand, psychometric distortions do
tend to generate dynamic inconsistency in preferences: an agent with distorted time perception
has preferences for future tradeoffs which are inconsistent with the preferences that she will
actually have in the future.
In the model above, agents perceive objective time with a distortion, leading to present-focus.
Agents might instead perceive delays between two options with distortions, such that the delay
between 𝑡 and 𝑡 is perceived as 𝜏 𝑡
𝑡 rather than 𝜏 𝑡′
𝜏 𝑡 . This psychometric distortion
of delays can be one source of subadditivity (Read 2001; Scholten and Read 2006; see also
Glimcher, Kable, and Louie 2007; and Kable and Glimcher 2010).17 Specifically, subadditivity
arises when discounting over a time interval is greater when the interval is divided into
subintervals, which is a robust empirical regularity. Subadditivity produces choices that mimic a
key property of hyperbolic discounting: diminishing discount rates as the length of the
discounting period is increased. Despite this similarity with hyperbolic discounting, discounters
who exhibit subadditivity will not choose commitment and their preferences will be dynamically
consistent.18 Neither perceiving delays with distortions nor subadditivity generate presentfocused preferences, since an additional delay is perceived the same regardless of whether it
begins now or in the future. As a result, a sub-additive agent will make the same choice today
(e.g., 1 util now vs. x utils tomorrow) as she will for the future (1 util in t days vs. x utils in 𝑡
1 days).19

Subadditivity may be rational if there is implicit information (e.g., about riskiness) in the way that information is
elicited from subjects. For example, it may be that any delay in payment is associated with an implied risk, and the
magnitude of the risk is not (highly) dependent on the length of the delay. Under this interpretation, subadditivity
could be included in subsection 2.5.
18
Specifically, their views about tradeoffs between utils at t and utils at 𝑡
𝑡 does not depend on when (on or
before date t) they are asked to express this preference.
19
Cohen, Ericson, Laibson, and White (2016) discuss the evidence for two distinct features of hyperbolic
discounting: discount rates fall as a front-end delay is added and as the length of the discounting period is increased.
Subadditivity can account for the latter regularity.
17

Page 15

Other psychometric distortions produce present-focused preferences. For example, subjective
probability distortions, such as the probability weighting function of Kahneman and Tversky
(1979), will produce behavior that mimics hyperbolic discounting. Specifically, if the present is
perceived to be risk free (in the sense that promised rewards will be delivered with certainty), but
the near future is perceived to introduce a tiny amount of risk, then the existence of a certainty
effect (whereby a very small amount of risk is subjectively treated like a large reduction in
likelihood), will generate behavior like present bias. For related arguments see the non-expected
utility frameworks in Prelec and Loewenstein (1991), Quiggin and Horowitz (1995), Keren and
Roelofsma (1995), Weber and Chapman (2005), Halevy (2008), Epper, Fehr-Duda, and Bruhin
(2011), Baucells and Heukamp (2012), Andreoni and Sprenger (2012), Epper and Fehr-Duda
(2015), Chakraborty (2017). These models do not generate a demand for commitment, but they
do generate dynamically inconsistent preferences.
Heuristic reasoning can also generate present-focused preferences. Proportional reasoning can
lead to behavior that has many of the properties generated by a hyperbolic discount function.
For example, if a delay from 0 days to 1 day seems like a large delay (because the average delay
is ½) but a delay from 100 days to 101 days seems like a small delay because the average is
100½, then agents may respond more aversively to rewards that are delayed in the former than in
the latter case (Rubinstein, 2003; Read et al 2013; Ericson et al 2015). Agents that are using
heuristic reasoning will not choose commitment, but they will express dynamically inconsistent
preferences.
The focusing model of Kőszegi and Szeidl (2013) also generates present focused preferences in
some circumstances. In this model, consumers choose among multi-dimensional consumption
vectors, where each dimension represents an attribute. The consumer maximizes focus-weighted
utility, which disproportionately weights attributes in which her options generate a greater range
of consumption utility. Their model produces no present-focus when simply trading off utility at
two different dates. However, agents may display present-focus when they frame a choice (like
exercising today) as an isolated current decision with a salient up-front cost (going to the gym)
and a stream of tiny non-salient benefits (being slightly healthier, each day over the next few
years because you exercised once). When instead framing the decision as a continuous stream of
exercise (in the future) and a stream of large health benefits (that arise from a consistent routine
of exercising), the agent makes a more patient choice. The all-in or all-out decision leads to
patient choices, because now the streams of costs and benefits are both large and the focusing
bias does not make the cost of exercise disproportionately salient. Agents with focusing bias will
not choose commitment if the bias is a perceptual error, but they will express dynamically
inconsistent preferences.

2.6.

Models of myopia

The concept of myopic decision-making has been discussed for millennia. Though it is not
possible to locate the intellectual origin of this idea there are many historical milestones.20 For
See Loewenstein (1992) for a review of the 19th and 20th century intellectual history of theories of intertemporal
choice.
20

Page 16

example, Böhm-Bawerk (1890) wrote that “we possess inadequate power to imagine and to
abstract, or that we are not willing to put forth the necessary effort, but in any event we limn a
more or less incomplete picture of our future wants and especially of the remotely distant ones.
And then, there are all of those wants that never come to mind at all.”
Pigou (1920) similarly observed “that our telescopic faculty is defective, and that we, therefore,
see future pleasures, as it were, on a diminished scale. That this is the right explanation is proved
by the fact that exactly the same diminution is experienced when, apart from our tendency to
forget ungratifying incidents, we contemplate the past.”
Even if we stipulate that people are “myopic,” it is not at all clear what that formally means.
Loosely speaking, myopia is a failure to clearly see the future when it is forecastable in principle
(e.g., if one “took their head out of the sand” or “stopped living completely in the moment”).21
Gabaix and Laibson (2017) model myopia as the consequence of cognitive noise that reduces the
accuracy of signals about future events (see also related work by Commons et al 1982, 1991).
Because agents know that their signals are noisy, they shade those signals toward their prior,
causing their forecasts to be relatively unresponsive to true variation in future rewards.
Consequently, future utility flows are given less weight then they would have if perceptions were
not noisy. This implies that the agent will exhibit present-focused preferences: the agent’s
choices will reflect greater sensitivity to the attributes – positive and negative – that are
experienced in the present.
The model of Gabaix and Laibson produces behavior that mimics much of the behavior that
arises under hyperbolic discounting. However, the model generates no taste for commitment
because the agents are not encumbered by a self-control problem; their only problem is that they
are unable to see clearly into the future. The model assumes that agents have underlying
dynamically consistent preferences. However, the agent may not be able to act on these
preferences because her noisy perceptions of future payoffs undermines the expression of these
preferences, leading her to exhibit preferences that appear to be dynamically inconsistent to an
outside observer who doesn’t appreciate her perceptual limitations.
Other forms of myopia also produce behavior that appears to be characteristic of dynamically
inconsistent preferences. For example, one could interpret the focusing model of Kőszegi and
Szeidl (2013) as a model of selective myopia (i.e., overlooking the attributes that are not focal).
This model implies no commitment and generates (expressed) preferences that will appear to be
dynamically consistent to an outside observer. See Frederick (2005) for another mechanism that
can produce myopia: a low propensity to engage in cognitive reflection. See also Steele and
Joseph (1990) for alcohol-induced myopia.

2.7.

Overview of models of present-focused preferences

We have reviewed a large family of models that feature present-focused preferences. These
models share the property that agents choose more impatiently for the present than when they
21

Early formulations of myopia were developed by Brown and Lewis (1981) and Jéhiel (1995).
Page 17

choose for the future. Commonalities of models in the intertemporal choice literature have been
noted by many authors (e.g., Barro, 1999; Krusell, Kuruşçu, and Smith, 2010, Gustman and
Steinmeier 2012, Gabaix and Laibson 2017).
Despite this core similarity, the models in this literature have many contrasting properties, some
of which are summarized in Table 1 below. The taste for commitment (which is captured in the
rows of the table) is a particularly important differentiator, because this is directly observable in
choices. In other words, we can (in principle) observe this smoking gun if we can find settings in
which commitment is purely choice-set restricting and not confounded by other benefits (like tax
advantages in illiquid retirement savings plans). However, see Laibson (2015, 2018) for reasons
that we may not expect to see commitment in practice. For example, exogenous uncertainty may
make commitment undesirable even for fully sophisticated present-biased agents who would
commit themselves in an idealized world with no uncertainty.
Dynamic consistency of preferences is captured in the columns of Table 1. Dynamic consistency
in preferences is not measurable by observing (binding) choices. Rather it is a property of a
model. As an empirical object, it is measured by asking people about their current statecontingent preferences (in future states).

dynamic consistency of preferences (columns).

2.8.

Models that do not generate present-focused preferences

Finally, we conclude Section 2 by emphasizing that there are other influential models of
intertemporal choice that do not fall into the category of present-focused preferences. Presentfocused preferences undergird a large part of the intertemporal choice literature, but not all of it.
Habits and related reference-point effects lead agents to experience larger utility flows when they
can favorably compare current consumption to their own past consumption, to consumption of
their peers, or to consumption that they had expected (e.g., Ryder and Heal, 1973; Becker and
Murphy 1988; Loewenstein 1988; Abel, 1990; Hoch and Loewenstein, 1991; Loewenstein and
Sicherman, 1991; Loewenstein and Prelec, 1992, 1993; Prelec and Loewenstein, 1998; Campbell
and Cochrane, 1999; Laibson, 2001; Koszegi and Rabin, 2009). Some of these models generate

Page 18

present-focused preferences, as in the preferred calibration of Koszegi and Rabin (2009). But
most of these theoretical mechanisms have the effect of leading agents to choose consumption
profiles with a relatively higher slope (i.e., less consumption now and more consumption in the
future), so the comparisons to past consumption will be more favorable over the lifecycle.
Anticipation effects also encourage consumers to move rewarding events into the future so they
can be savored in advance (Loewenstein 1987; Caplin and Leahy 2001, Kreps 1998). This idea
has a long history. Loewenstein (1987) quotes Alfred Marshall on the topic: “When calculating
the rate at which a future benefit is discounted, we must be careful to make allowance for the
pleasures of expectation.” (Marshall, 1891, p. 178).
Finally, there is a class of models that have implications for the timing of the resolution of
uncertainty (e.g., Kreps and Porteus 1978; Epstein and Zin 1989; Weil 1990). Depending on the
calibration of these models, they can either rationalize a preference for early or late resolution of
uncertainty.

3. Empirical Regularities and Open Puzzles
We turn now to a series of well-established empirical regularities, each of which is also
associated with some important open questions. Additionally, we identify a number of additional
open questions for future research.

3.1.

Preferences over Monetary Receipt Timing

Empirical Regularity #1: Individuals require a high rate of return (RRR) for money earlier
versus later tradeoffs.
One of the primary ways time preference has been measured has been with Money Earlier or
Later (MEL) experiments, in which subjects choose between X dollars at an early date or Y
dollars at a later date. 22 While the models we discuss above are—almost always—
fundamentally about the discounting of utility, it is hard to directly give an individual a unit of
utility. Money is easily measured, is socially important, and is a placeholder for reward (albeit
one that can be easily intertemporally shifted). Accordingly, a large literature examines how
individuals choose between money earlier and later.
To describe the indifference points generated by individuals making choices over financial
flows, we follow Cohen, Ericson, Laibson, and White (2016) and study the required rate of
return (RRR). If an individual is indifferent between $x1 at time t1 and $x2 at a later time t2, we
define the RRR between time t1 and t2 to be ln . (This is approximately the percentage
difference between the rewards received in the respective periods.) Likewise, we define the
annualized RRR as23
This section and Section 2 draw in part on Cohen, Ericson, Laibson, and White (2016).
These definitions are derived from the following implicit definition of an instantaneous annual rate of return, 𝑟:
exp 𝑟 𝑡
𝑡
.

22
23

Page 19

ln ,
where time units are measured in years. For comparability, it will often be convenient to
annualize the RRR, though this hides some important information about the type of choices from
which the RRR was estimated.
Note that the RRR is not a preference parameter. The discount rate for utility requires additional
assumptions on when and how financial flows translate into utility: does the receipt of money
correspond to receipt of utility at that time? Does utility increase approximately linearly in the
amount of money received, or is there substantial curvature even over small amounts of money?
Cohen, Ericson, Laibson, and White highlight the difficulty of interpreting what MEL
experiments imply for discounting of utility, and present different models that are used to
translate MEL choices into (estimated) discount functions.
The first published MEL paper is Thaler (1981), who showed a number of anomalies using
hypothetical MEL questions, including the key finding that the annualized RRR declines as the
time horizon gets longer (holding the earlier payment date fixed).24 Kirby (1997) used incentive
compatible (sealed second bid auctions) to measure the RRR at different time horizons, and
found similar results, finding that a hyperbolic function fit the data better than the exponential
discount function. The MEL design was used by several other economists after Thaler (e.g.
Loewenstein & Thaler, 1989; Prelec & Loewenstein, 1991); it was popularized in the psychology
literature by Kirby and Herrnstein (1995). MEL experiments now account for a large share of
intertemporal choice research (Cohen, Ericson, Laibson, and White 2016).
There are many anomalies that characterize measured RRR’s. An influential review (Frederick,
Loewenstein and O’Donoghue, 2002) documented numerous regularities uncovered in MEL
experiments. For instance, as discussed above, the annualized RRR falls as the horizon, d,
between t1 and t2 = t1+d increases. There is also a robust magnitude effect (RRR’s decrease as
the magnitude of both $x1 and $x2 are proportionately scaled up). Moreover, as discussed in
Section 2.5, there is subadditivity in MEL choices: individuals are more impatient over a delay if
that delay is subdivided into smaller intervals (Read 2001; Read and Roelofsma 2003). Consider
three delays: t1 < t2 < t3, and two indifferences: {$x1, t1} ̴ {$x2, t2} and {$x2, t2} ̴ {$x3, t3}.
Transitivity implies that {$x1, t1} ̴ {$x3, t3}, but subadditivity implies that the individual will
strictly prefer {$x3, t3} to {$x1, t1}. This complicates any easy aggregation of choices into a
simple RRR.
Finally, the method used to elicit choices can affect measured preferences.25 The literature has
used a variety of methods, most commonly multiple price lists, matching/fill-in-the blank, or
convex time budget tasks.
We believe that the first implementation in humans was an unpublished working paper by Maital and Maital
(1977). A related stream of work studied discounting in animal behavior (e.g. Chung and Herrnstein 1967, Ainslie
1975).
25
Freeman, Manzini, Mariotti, and Mittone (2016) compare two “matching methods” (that of Becker DeGroot and
Marshak 1964, henceforth BDM, and a sealed second price auction) with multiple price lists and find a significant
24

Page 20

There is no single RRR that summarizes an individual’s preference over money. However, we
can summarize some of the quantitative stylized facts that have emerged from this literature. For
payments now versus later, Thaler (1981) found median annualized RRRs of 20-30 percent for
delays of 3-5 years, and annualized RRRs of 40-345 percent for delays of 1 month, depending on
the magnitude of the rewards in his choice set. In the earliest paper to examine discounting in a
representative sample (with incentivized choice), Harrison, Lau, and Williams (2002) conduct a
field experiment in Denmark, and find an average annual RRR of 28% (with substantial
individual heterogeneity), based on choices between an earlier payment in 1 month and later
payments at delays of 6 to 36 months. Dohmen et al. (2010) study a representative sample of
Germans who (repeatedly) chose between a payment now or a payment in 12 months, and report
a median annualized RRR of about 30%.
An annual RRR of 30% is high (for instance, higher than almost all credit card APRs). However,
note that these RRRs are estimated from choices with delays of months to years. Choices
measured from delays of only days yield even higher annualized RRRs, as summarized by
Frederick, Loewenstein and O’Donoghue (2002).
A second wave of experiments aims at measuring the discount function for a time-separable
utility model. This typically requires accounting for potential curvature in the utility function.26
The literature also typically assumes a “consume-on-receipt model” in which individuals
consume the money on the date they receive it. The consume-on-receipt assumption is different
from an optimization model in which individuals smooth consumption across periods. (See a
detailed discussion below and in Cohen, Ericson, Laibson, and White 2016.)
Discount rates are typically lower once utility is adjusted for curvature. Andersen et al. (2008)
measure utility curvature from choices over gambles (a “double multiple price list,” once for
time and one for risk). They estimate an average discount rate of about 10% per year for a
representative sample of experimental participants in Denmark. Andreoni and Sprenger (2012)
introduce a convex time budget method to account for utility curvature, and estimate an average
annual discount rate of 25 to 35% for college students.27
It is worth noting that utility curvature for small payments requires two assumptions: that
payments are consumed on the day (or period, however defined) the payments are received
(without crowd out), and that individuals have small scale risk aversion. The first assumption
requires a strong degree of narrow bracketing, and is at odds with field evidence measuring
marginal propensities to consume. The second assumption is empirically plausible, though it is at
difference between RRRs measured with the BDM mechanism and multiple price lists. Hardisty et al. (2013)
compare matching with multiple price lists and find that matching has fewer demand characteristics. (Multiple price
lists can anchor subjects or suggest a reasonable range of choices.)
26
Abdellaoui, Attema, and Bleichrodt (2010), Olea and Strzalecki (2014), and Ericson and Noor (2015) provide
alternative methods for measuring characteristics of discounting without measuring utility curvature. Noor (2009)
highlights the importance of accounting for curvature and background consumption in reaching conclusions about
the shape of the discount function.
27
Andreoni, Kuhn, and Sprenger (2015) compare the performance of the convex time budget to the double multiple
price list method (utility curvature measured from risky choices) and find that the convex time budget predicts
better.

odds with the theoretical prediction of the expected utility model that utility should be
approximately linear with respect to small gains or losses (Rabin 2000). Another line of work
argues that attitudes over risk do not describe consumption utility curvature (see Andreoni and
Sprenger 2012b, Abdellaoui et al. 2013, and Cheung 2016).
Another literature examines RRR for money outside the lab. This literature has some advantages
over lab-based questions, but also raises methodological questions. One of the most influential
papers was written by Hausman (1979), who examined the tradeoff between upfront prices when
buying appliances v. the long-run operating costs (energy efficiency), and found implied
annualized RRR’s of about 20%. However, the tradeoffs may not have been salient to individuals
(see a discussion in Allcott and Greenstone 2012).
There is also an ongoing debate about the RRR implied by individuals’ willingness to pay for
fuel efficiency: Dreyfus and Viscusi (1995) estimate an RRR of 11-17%; Allcott and Wozny
(2014) estimate an RRR of about 15%. Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013) estimate RRR’s
that range from -6.2% to +20.9%, depending on their assumptions, and argue that the RRR is
similar to the range of interest rates paid by borrowers.
In another classic paper, Warner and Pleeter (2001) examine the choice between an annuity and a
lump sum payment. They show that most enrollees selected the lump-sum, implying a RRR that
exceed 17%. This paper has been widely interpreted as evidence for under-annuitization.
However, this estimate had important confounds: choosing the annuity came with additional
requirements to be in the reserves; lump-sum recipients also received a variety of additional
benefits not given to annuity recipients (see Simon, Warner, and Pleeter, 2014).
Similarly, Coile et al. (2002) find that individuals claim Social Security payments too early;
under reasonable discount rates, most would be better off delaying claiming and effectively
purchasing a larger annuity. This can be interpreted as evidence for a high RRR or may instead
be linked to lack of knowledge about the rules and tradeoffs that exist in the Social Security
system (Brown et al 2017). There is also a more general puzzle about low levels of annuitization
(Benartzi, Previtero, and Thaler 2011; Beshears et al 2014).
Open Question #1: Why do individuals have such a high RRR for money if impatience is
fundamentally about consumption flows rather than financial flows?
The money-earlier-or-later (MEL) literature raises fundamental methodological questions. A
body of theoretical research argues against inferring discount rates from MEL studies because
financial flows are fungible. Money flows are about financing, and distinct from the actual
timing of consumption. Coller and Williams (1999) develop a model in which MEL choices
reveal an individual’s discount rate only if the revealed annualized RRR is strictly between her
borrowing and lending rates.28 In their framework, an individual’s annualized RRR reflects either
her financing costs/return or her discount rate. However, Cubitt and Read (2007) show that the
censored data techniques of Coller and Williams are not applicable when agents have concave
See also Chabris et al (2008) for another analysis of the confounds posed by intertemporal substitution, as well as
other problems associated with the MEL paradigm.

utility functions and pick interior points of their choice sets: even when an observed RRR
(imputed from binary choices) is between an individual’s borrowing and lending rate, it will not
reveal their discount rate but rather joint information about both the curvature of their utility
function and their discount rate.29
To utilize the MEL paradigm, the literature has often explicitly or implicitly assumed a consumeon-receipt model, in which individuals consume payments when they get them (e.g. Thaler 1981;
Kirby and Herrnstein 1995; Loewenstein and Prelec 1992; Andersen et al 2008, Benhabib et al.
2010, Halevy 2014, 2015). Yet the estimated marginal propensity to consume out of financial
receipts is much lower than one: people don’t instantly consume everything they receive on the
day of receipt. For instance, Johnson, Parker, Souleles (2006) examined spending responses to
receipt of a tax rebate ($300-$600) that households knew would be coming and found that in the
3-month period after receiving the payment, households spend 20-40% of the payment on nondurables; Parker et al. (2013) found similar effects.
Evidence specific to MEL studies also provides evidence against the consume-on-receipt model.
Reuben, Sapienza, and Zingales (2015) looked at the check cashing behavior for participants
paid in MEL studies, and found that only about half of participants cashed their check within two
weeks of receipt, even though they had chosen a smaller immediate payment than a 2-week
delayed payment. However, note that consumption could occur without cashing the check.
One might rescue the consume-on-receipt assumption if experimental participants made choices
as if they would consume on receipt, even if they do not. However, research we discuss in the
next section suggests that individuals discount money differently than real consumption rewards
(Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger 2015). Moreover, both Carvalho, Meier, and Wang (2016)
and Dean and Sautmann (2018) show that MEL decisions were affected by income shocks,
providing evidence against this narrow bracketing assumption (see also Cassidy 2017).
Similarly, Krupka and Stephens (2013) show that changes in the inflation rate and in income are
correlated with MEL decisions.
As a result, it remains an open question how to interpret behavior in MEL studies, and the extent
to which it informs us about discount rates versus other factors such as heuristics, trust, risk, or
probability weighting. (We discuss some of these alternative factors in Section 4.3.)

3.2.

Preferences over Consumption Timing

Empirical Regularity #2: Individuals require a high rate of return (RRR) for real rewards.
Choices over real rewards display robust present-focused preferences. When estimated with
structural models, short-run discount rates are high.

See Andreoni et al (2018) for evidence against arbitrage as an explanation for behavior on intertemporal choice
tasks.

29

Page 23

If discounting is over utility flows, a promising experimental design is to give individuals
choices over time-yoked consumption, such as food or leisure—what we will term “real
rewards.” The literature on real rewards and intertemporal choice was inaugurated by Mischel
and Ebbesen (1970) and Mischel et al (1989) with the famous “marshmallow test” conducted
with children. There were many different design variants, aimed at testing strategies that enabled
self-control, but the different paradigms shared a common structure: participants were brought to
a lab, and were told they could have one candy/cookie now or wait until the experimenter
returned and have two. Marshmallows weren’t always used, but they have become the canonical
example of how the experiment was run. Some subjects took the “marshmallow” immediately,
others waited for some time before taking the sooner marshmallow, while still others waited for
experimenter to return (typically 15 minutes) to receive both marshmallows. The marshmallow
test is commonly assumed to measure individual differences in impatience, and some evidence
shows that behavior in the test is predictive of later life outcomes.30 However, Michel’s original
intent was to investigate the effect of different strategies for implementing self-control (rather
than persistent individual differences). Moreover, McGuire and Kable (2012, 2013) argue that
participants who waited some time, then took a single marshmallow, might be better interpreted
as learning about their environment (i.e. learning how long it would take for the experimenter to
return) rather than failing to implement self-control.
Many studies show that RRR for real rewards are typically higher than for money: see e.g. Odum
and Rainaud (2003), Odum, Baumann, and Rimington (2006), Estle et al. (2007), Lawyer et al.
(2010), Tsukayama and Duckworth (2010), Reuben, Sapienza, and Zingales (2010), and Ubfal
(2016). Some papers find extremely high RRR.31 McClure et al. (2007) employed time-dated
juice rewards in a neuroimaging experiment in which participants were asked to choose one of
two time-yoked water/juice squirts (subjects were thirsty, because they were denied fluid for
three hours before the experiment and then fed salty snacks at the start of the experiment). They
assume linear utility and estimate a quasi-hyperbolic discounting model that treats immediate
juice as “now” but delays as small and 1 min in the future. They estimate β = 0.52 and δ close to
1.
Converting those RRR’s into discount rates requires the researcher to account for curvature in
the utility function, where curvature is now not over money, but over the real reward itself.
Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger (2015) show that participants in their study discount
monetary rewards differently from real effort tasks. Estimating a quasi-hyperbolic discounting
model separately for both money and effort, they find very little present-bias for money (𝛽
0.97) but more present-bias for effort: 𝛽 0.89.
Testing for the existence of present-bias (or more generally present-focused preferences) does
not require accounting for the curvature of the utility (however, quantifying present-bias does).
Present-bias (or present-focused preferences) can be demonstrated when the type of real rewards
A literature using small subgroup analyses found that performance in the marshmallow task predicted SAT scores
years later (Shoda, Mischel, and Peake 1990). A recent conceptual replication (Watts, Duncan, and Quan 2018)
found a correlation about half the size as the original correlation, and which was reduced by 2/3 when controls for
childhood background were included. Benjamin et al (2018) report that the (childhood) marshmallow task does not
predict mid-life measures of capital formation.

chosen systematically differs when individuals chose for immediate consumption versus for
future consumption. In this paradigm, participants make choices between “long-term
gratification” and “short-term gratification” goods. For instance, Read and van Leeuwen (1998)
examined the choice between healthy and unhealthy snacks. Across conditions, unhealthy snacks
were chosen 51% of the time when offered for consumption one week in the future, while same
unhealthy snacks were chosen 83% of the time when offered for immediate consumption.
Similar results were shown by Read, Loewenstein, and Kalyanaraman (1999) in a paradigm in
which participants choose between “high-brow” and “low-brow” movies. Studies like this make
a conceptual distinction between goods that generate immediate utility costs and future utility
benefits – what Dellavigna and Malmender (2004, 2006) call “investment goods” – and goods
with the opposite time profile – or “leisure goods” (see the related discussion in Section 2, where
we discuss the measurement of experienced utility, and Banerjee and Mullainathan 2010 on
“temptation goods”).
Finally, in contrast to the experimental literature, studies using field choices have inferred
discount rates explicitly for consumption. Laibson, Maxted, Repetto, and Tobacman (2017) use
the method of simulated moments (MSM) to estimate a lifecycle consumption model with
present bias, estimating 𝛽 0.5 and 𝛿 0.987 (see also Angeletos et al 2001). Other papers
have used job search behavior to calibrate discounting models. DellaVigna and Paserman (2005)
find 𝛽 often near 0.9 (depending on assumptions). Paserman (2008) estimates 𝛽 separately by
income and finds that 𝛽=0.4-0.5 for low and moderate wage workers, but less present bias for
high wage workers (𝛽=0.9).
Food consumption provides another way to calibrate discounting models, and results are not
consistent with exponential discounting. Using caloric intake data on food stamp recipients,
Shapiro (2005) estimates high short-run discounting; imposing the exponential model, he
estimates an unreasonable annual discount factor of 0.23—implying a discount rate of –ln(0.23)
—but when estimating a quasi-hyperbolic model and assuming log-utility, he roughly calibrates
𝛽 0.96. Mastrobuoni and Weinberg (2009) examine food consumption of liquidity constrained
social security recipients and find 𝛽 0.91-0.94.
Open Question #2: How substitutable is consumption (and effort) across time? How does the
substitution of consumption affect measured discount rates?
Real rewards appear promising because they deliver incremental utility flows at a given time;
moreover discounting of real rewards appears different than discounting of money receipt. Yet,
in theory, consumption studies can introduce similar confounds: individuals can change
consumption in other areas of life to offset experimentally induced consumption. For instance,
consider an individual choosing how much to work (as opposed to relax) in a lab session today v.
next week. If the individual works more in the lab right now, they could offset that by relaxing
more after they leave the lab. Moreover, present choices may appear different from future
choices: if an individual’s plans for today are largely fixed but future plans are flexible, effort in
the lab today will be incremental effort for the day, while planned effort for next week can be
offset by reducing effort outside the lab. If, for instance, utility is aggregated at the day level and
can easily be adjusted outside the lab, the utility experience in a given hour in the lab need not
impact utility that day.

Page 25

As intertemporal choice research increasingly moves toward using real consumption rewards,
estimates of how substitutable utility is across time and structural models that account for
offsetting behavior are needed.

3.3.

Preference Reversals

Empirical Regularity #3: Individuals exhibit (present-focused) preference reversals.
One of the key anomalies of the intertemporal choice literature is the concept of preference
reversals. Indeed, in our view, the unifying theme of the (behavioral) intertemporal choice
literature is the concept of preference-focused preferences (introduced in Section 2), which boils
down to a preference reversal. Recall our earlier definition: Present-focused preferences exist if
agents are relatively more likely to currently choose actions that generate instant gratification,
then they are to currently choose the same (binding) actions for future periods. We hasten to
remind the reader that preference reversals are not the same as dynamic inconsistency in
preferences, a point we will return to below.
Read and Van Leeuwen (1998) present a canonical example of a preference reversal. In their
study experimental participants are asked to choose among six snacks (two healthy and four
unhealthy)32 to be delivered after seven days. We’ll refer to the asking date as day 0 and the
delivery data as day 7. On day 0, the participants are not told that they will have an opportunity
to revisit this choice on day 7, an important design decision, that we will discuss momentarily.
Read and Van Leeuwen create a 2×2 design, where they vary the degree of satiation at day 0
(“after lunch time,” when they are presumably satiated, or “in the late afternoon, around 4:30 or
5:00,” when they are presumably not satiated) and the degree of satiation at day 7. Experimental
participants are told on day 0 when the snack will be delivered on day 7. In other words, they
know at day 0 whether they will receive the day-7 snack after lunch time or in the late afternoon.
In the always satiated condition (asked when satiated and delivered when satiated), 26% of
participants choose an unhealthy snack at date 0 (to be delivered on day 7), and 70% of
participants choose an unhealthy snack on day 7. In the always non-satiated condition (asked
when non-satiated and delivered when non-satiated), 78% of participants choose an unhealthy
snack at date 0 (to be delivered on day 7), and 92% of participants choose an unhealthy snack on
day 7. (There is a ceiling effect in the always non-satiated condition.)
In both the always satiated condition and the always non-satiated condition there is a switch on
day 7 towards snacks that offer greater instant gratification (e.g., a Snickers bar vs. an apple).
This is the essence of present-focused preferences. When people choose the snack to be eaten
“now” they are relatively more likely to choose snacks that offer instant gratification then when
they choose (what they think will be a binding) choice 7 days in advance. Many of the models

The six snacks, rank-ordered from most to least healthy are apples (1.33), bananas (1.67), crisps (3.91),
borrelnoten (4.08), Mars bars (4.67), and Snickers bars (5.33). The numbers in parentheses are the average rankordering.

32

Page 26

discussed in Section 2 would predict this type of “preference reversal,” although they offer
different explanations for the reversal.
Many related studies have documented preference reversals, including Read, Loewenstein and
Kalyanaraman (1999), DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004, 2006), Badger et al (2007), Milkman,
Rogers, and Bazerman (2009), Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger (2015), Sadoff, Samek, and
Sprenger (2015), Kuchler and Pagel (2018), and Fedyk (2018).33 It is also important to note that
preference reversals come in three broad methodological categories. First, strong form
preference reversals occur when the same decision is made by the same person at an early date
and then again at a later date (as in Read and Van Leeuwen 1998). Semi-strong form preference
reversals occur when the same person makes a decision now and also makes a decision for the
future. Weak form preference reversals occur when different people make the now decision and
the later decision.
Open Question #3: What are the key mechanisms that cause preference reversals?
Preference reversals are consistent with both dynamically inconsistent preferences and
dynamically consistent preferences. For example, present-bias generates preference reversals of
the type that we have just discussed due to dynamically inconsistent preferences (see Section
2.1). Present-biased agents heavily weight immediate rewards (which are not β-discounted)
relative to delayed rewards (which are β-discounted), leading present-biased agents to more
frequently choose candy (and other unhealthy snacks) when they are available immediately,
compared to when they are available at a delay. Read and Van Leeuwen (1998) interpret their
results as evidence for present-biased preferences, but this is not the only way to understand their
findings.
Unitary-self models (which feature dynamically consistent preferences), also predict preference
reversals. Here the mechanism is the temptation effects that are assumed to arise when decisions
are being made in the moment (i.e., for eating candy now) but do not arise when decisions are
being made for the future. In other words, candy now is tempting, but candy next week is not
tempting. Accordingly, an agent will more readily choose candy now than candy later. All of
this can be explained with a model in which agents are dynamically consistent. Specifically, the
agent says that she would like to choose fruit later if she can commit herself. However, she does
not prefer to choose fruit later if she can’t commit herself, because she anticipates that the
temptation effects (that will arise later if she hasn’t pre-committed) will make choosing fruit later
suboptimal. In this sense, she is dynamically consistent. On day 0, she only prefers fruit later if
she can pre-commit herself to choose fruit later (i.e., if she can restrict her choice set). On day 0.
she prefers candy later if she can’t restrict her day-7 choice set.34
Of course, (dynamically inconsistent) present-bias and (dynamically consistent) temptation
effects are mutually compatible. In other words, they are likely both present in human
motivation. One open challenge is to identify and measure their quantitative contributions. A
related open challenge is to understand the role that naiveté plays in all of these intertemporal
Preference reversals also emerge in other domains. For example, Andreoni, Aydin, Barton, Bernheim, and
Naecker (2016) document preference reversals in social preferences.

See Sadoff, Samek, and Sprenger (2015) for related evidence from a field experiment.

choice models. For example, a naïve agent with temptation preferences may not appreciate how
temptation will affect her later choices, leading the agent to look nearly indistinguishable from a
naïve present-biased agent. Accordingly, it is important to understand not only the underlying
mix of preferences that agents have, but also to understand their meta-awareness of these
preferences.

3.4.

Procrastination

Empirical Regularity #4: We procrastinate and deadlines can help.
While many people agree that procrastination is widespread, we do not have precise, commonly
shared definition of procrastination. In our discussion here, we will define someone as
procrastinating if, when completing a costly task, there is delay that appears suboptimal from
their own perspective. Procrastination, is by our definition, a problem, and can result from
different models.35
Anecdotal examples of procrastination abound, perhaps most famously in Akerlof’s (1991)
discussion of how he continually put off returning a box to a friend—and showed how small
mistakes could lead to large welfare losses: each day, the loss from delaying one more day was
small, but the overall cost of delaying versus sending at the start was quite large.
The theoretical analysis of procrastination through the lens of present-bias was developed in a
series of papers by O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999a, 1999b, 2001). For naïve individuals
completing a single task, present-bias quite intuitively leads to excess (and unpredicted) delay;
but behavior of present-biased individuals can become quite complex for sophisticates, or when
there are multiple tasks from which to choose. For instance, there are special circumstances in
which sophisticates may sometimes complete a task earlier than a time-consistent individual
because they recognize if they delay today they will delay even more in the future; as a result,
present-bias needn’t always lead to procrastination. However, in most settings, agents with
present bias (i.e., 𝛽 1, holding all else equal), will procrastinate more than agents without
present bias, whether the present-biased agents are naïve or sophisticated.
Nor does every behavior that looks like problematic delay qualify as procrastination. For
instance, it is widely observed that people—especially students—wait until right before a
deadline to act, and this is often interpreted as procrastination. Yet this behavior can emerge
quite naturally if there is little value to completing the task in advance of the deadline (see Fisher
2001’s theoretical analysis). If individuals did not describe waiting until the deadline to be
inefficient, this wouldn’t qualify as procrastination in our definition.
Much of the systematic evidence on the extent of procrastination comes from the laboratory
(Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger 2015) or from field experiments with students (e.g., Fedyk
2018). There is also an older literature in education, not well-known by economists, examining
Alternatively, one can view procrastination through the lens of a model and define it more precisely. For instance,
through the lens of present-bias, procrastination can be defined as additional delay in completing a costly task
relative to the benchmark of a time-consistent model with correct beliefs (e.g. as in Ericson 2017).

35

Page 28

procrastination in students. For instance, Solomon and Rothblum (1984) found many students
self-report “procrastinating” in preparing for exams and that they also report wanting to reduce
procrastination, though it is unclear how subjects defined procrastination.
Procrastination is often closely connected to naiveté (but naiveté is not necessary for
procrastination – see Carroll et al 2009). DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004, 2006) have a pair of
papers that examine procrastination behavior in the context of gym attendance; we discuss the
role of naiveté in these papers in the next section. DellaVigna and Malmendier (2006) show that
individuals take “too long” to cancel their gym contract after their last attendance (an average of
about 2 months). Calibrations suggest that a sophisticated person would cancel in a few days,
while naiveté can explain the much longer observed delay. DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004)
show that firms will design contracts to take advantage of this procrastination on cancellation
behavior, creating contracts with automatic renewal and switching and cancellation costs.
Other research identifies behavior that is likely procrastination and shows it is connected to other
behaviors that result from present-focus. For instance, Brown and Previtero (2016) show the
people who wait until the last day of health plan open enrollment to enroll (“procrastinators”)
take longer to sign up for 401(k) plans, contribute less to those plans, and are more likely to take
the default fund allocation in the 401(k). Similarly, Reuben, Sapienza, and Zingales (2015)
measure how quickly individuals complete various tasks (e.g. application to university and
mandatory surveys); procrastinators on those measures take longer to cash their payment check.
Deadlines are a type of commitment device that may reduce procrastination. Ariely and
Wertenbroch (2002) provide influential evidence on deadlines that is often interpreted as
evidence about procrastination. They assigned one section of students to fixed, evenly spaced
deadlines for class assignments, while students in the other section got to choose their own
deadlines at the beginning of the semester. One key fact is that when given the choice, about
two-thirds of their study participants do self-impose binding deadlines (with financial penalties),
suggesting some sophistication about a self-control problem. However, these self-imposed
deadlines were less binding, on average than the evenly spaced deadlines. Second, performance
on assignments was lower in the self-chosen deadline condition than in the evenly spaced
deadlines. They show similar results in a lab-based proofreading task. The paper suggests the
interpretation that students do not set self-imposed deadlines “optimally,” from perspective of
maximizing class performance. However, it is possible that students in the self-chosen deadline
condition could be trading off preferences for flexibility in other areas of life against
performance in this class; in this view, self-chosen deadlines could lead to lower class
performance but higher individual welfare.
However, it is not always the case that interim deadlines increase performance; there is a tradeoff
between overcoming procrastination and maintaining flexibility. Burger, Charness, and Lynham
(2011) conduct deadline experiments for subjects completing online tasks. They found that
interim deadlines lowered performance (as measured by completion rates), in contrast to Ariely
and Wetenbroch’s (2002) results. Similarly, Bisin and Hyndman (2018) examine an experiment
in which participants have to complete tasks online. While they find robust demand for selfimposed deadlines, they also find that deadlines did not increase completion rates. Bisin and

Page 29

Hyndman estimate a structural model of present-bias and conclude that present-bias is
widespread.
Evidence on procrastination and deadlines outside of students and lab experiment is more limited
(however, see, Kaur, Kremer, and Mullainathan 2010, 2015; Duflo, Kremer and Robinson,
2011). Frakes and Wasserman (2017) provide intriguing evidence on procrastination in patent
examiners. They find that work is “end loaded” right before deadlines and argue that nonprocrastinating examiners would spread work evenly over time, while a procrastinator who
wants to make their target would cluster work at the end of each quota period. They provide
evidence that end loaded work is of lower quality. Moreover, it is likely that telecommuting (as
opposed to working in the office) could exacerbate procrastination; indeed, they find that endloading increases when a telecommuting program is introduced.
Explanations for Procrastination
Procrastination is often explained by time inconsistent preferences. However, limited attention or
memory can also explain excess delay, and can interact with present-bias in counter-intuitive
ways (see Ericson 2017). For example, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick (2002) examine
procrastination behavior in the context of retirement savings for white-collar workers. Out of
every 100 workers, 68 say that their savings rate is too low. When asked about future intentions,
24 of those 68 say they plan to increase their savings rate in the next two months. Yet data on
contribution rates reveal that only 3 of those 24 actually do so (over the next four months).
Similarly, at a financial education seminar, virtually all non-participating employees said they
planned to join the retirement savings plan, but only 14% followed through. A combination of
delay due to present-bias and then forgetting may explain this, as employees typically either
make changes almost immediately after their financial education seminar or not at all.
Another explanation for procrastination is the planning fallacy. Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
identified the concept of the planning fallacy: people typically underestimate how long it will
take to complete a task. The planning fallacy could be in part due to mispredicting future present
focus; the phenomenon is typically closely linked to incorrect beliefs about how much work will
be required. However, evidence on planning fallacy suggests that misprediction has an important
component apart from any issues of present-focus (e.g., a military contractor mispredicting the
time to delivery on a major weapons project).
Open Question #4: Why do people underestimate their own procrastination? What are the
relative roles of naiveté about present-focus versus other explanations for underestimating
procrastination, such as overconfidence about the effort required and limited memory?
Evidence on forecasts of task completion (e.g. Augenblick and Rabin 2018, Fedyk 2018) show
the people underestimate how long it will take to complete a task; estimated models of presentbias also often show substantial naiveté (see following section).
One open question is why people are naïve about their present-focus, which we discuss more
extensively in the next section. However, there are at least two other explanations for

Page 30

underestimating procrastination that do not rely on present-focus: overestimating memory
(attention) and underestimating how much work a task will be.
Individuals might not complete a task because they forget to do it for some period of time. The
issue of limited memory is taken up in a pair of papers by Ericson (2011, 2017). Ericson (2011)
finds experimental evidence that individuals are overconfident about the probability they will
remember to complete a task in the future. Ericson (2017) models the interaction between limited
memory and present-bias and shows that structural models can produced biased estimates of
present-bias if they incorrectly assume complete memory.
Empirically, lengthening deadlines can lower eventual task completion rates (Shu and Gneezy
2010; Taubinsky 2014). Having more time to complete a task should not lower completion rates
in a model of present-bias but can lower completion rates with limited memory (see Taubinksy
2014, Ericson 2017). This suggests that limited memory or inattention is important for
explaining procrastination, yet we do not have calibrated estimates of this mechanism.

Naiveté

Empirical Regularity #5: People partially but do not fully anticipate their extent of future
present-focus.
Do individuals correctly anticipate the extent of their future present-focus? That is are they
sophisticated, or naïve? A body of evidence indicates that people are at least partially naïve
about their present-focus: they may recognize they will in the future act in a present-focused
manner, but do not recognize the extent of this present-focus. Some evidence suggests that
individuals are fully naïve (they think they will act like a time-consistent exponential discounter
in the future).
We focus on naiveté about present-focus, which is a subset of incorrect beliefs. As a concept it is
distinct from overconfidence about ability, over-optimism about future challenges, or projection
bias. Nonetheless, it can be difficult in practice to distinguish among competing types of
incorrect beliefs. For instance, not saving much for the future today could result from
expectations that you will save more tomorrow, or that you will have a much higher income
tomorrow. Similarly, persistent failure to complete a task could arise from present bias and
naiveté (O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999a, 1999b) or from continually and incorrectly believing
that the cost of completing the task will be lower tomorrow than it is today. Moreover, Ericson
(2017) shows that overconfidence about memory/inattention can lead to a failure to act and may
be mistaken for present-bias.
Early evidence on naiveté comes from DellaVigna and Malmendier (2006), who show a pattern
of naiveté in the choice of gym contracts. First, individuals too often choose a contract with a flat
fee (at an effective rate of $17 per expected visit), even though the pay per visit is cheaper ($10
per visit fee). Moreover, users in the monthly contract are likely to stay enrolled beyond one year
than users committing for a year. This is surprising because monthly members pay higher fees
for the option to cancel each month, and suggests they over-estimated the probability they would
actually follow through on canceling.
Page 31

While DellaVigna and Malmendier (2006) rely on contract choice to identify misprediction of
future gym attendance, Acland and Levy (2015) directly elicit beliefs about future attendance
and find that individuals over-predict their future gym attendance by 1-2 visits per week.
(Moreover, participants in their study also failed to anticipate the extent to which incentives
would increase their future behavior, which Acland and Levy attribute to projection bias.)
Ariely and Wertenbroch (2002)’s finding that equally spaced deadlines lead to better
performance than self-chosen deadlines may be evidence of partial naiveté. However, as we
suggested in Section 3.4, participants in their study may have valued the flexibility of the later,
self-chosen deadlines.
Stronger evidence on incorrect beliefs in the classroom setting comes from Wong (2008), who
asks students when it would be ideal to start preparing for the final and when they predict they
will start preparing for the final. On average, students predicted they would start about 2.5 days
later than ideal, which Wong interprets as awareness of a self-control problem. However,
subsequent data on when students actually start preparing for the exam indicate that they started
preparing an average of about 2 days later than predicted; Wong classifies more than half the
sample as either fully or partially naïve and only a quarter as sophisticated (predictions within +/1 day of actual). Wong’s results could indicate naiveté about present-bias but could also be
consistent with overconfidence about future free time or about remembering to prepare.
Augenblick and Rabin (2018) examine present-bias and sophistication/naiveté about present-bias
in a real effort task. They estimate a 𝛽 of about 0.8 but estimate a 𝛽 near 1 (individual’s implied
perception of the 𝛽 that will determine their choices in the future, see Section 2.1). They cannot
reject the null hypothesis of no perceived present bias and can reject hypothesis that individuals
have an accurate perception of present bias.
Whether individuals are sophisticated or naïve about their present-focus matters for the contracts
that individuals will choose in equilibrium as well as for welfare. For instance, firms will design
contracts with backloaded fees if individuals are naïve about the probability they will
procrastinate on taking costly action to cancel a contract (e.g. gym membership) in the future
(DellaVigna and Malmendier 2004). Heidhues and Koszegi (2010) show that even a small
amount of naiveté in credit contract choices will lead individuals to have discontinuously lower
welfare than a sophisticated individual: firms design credit contracts with large penalties for
deferring repayment and naïve individuals choose these contracts because they underestimate the
probability they will pay these penalties.
Evidence suggests that people hold more accurate beliefs others’ procrastination than their own.
For instance, Fedyk (2018) estimates a structural model of present-bias on participants
completing a real-effort task. While individuals’ forecast of their own behavior implies a
substantial degree of naiveté, their forecasts for others were much more accurate.
Using field data on consumption, Kuchler and Pagel (2018) provide a method to classify people
as sophisticated or naïve based on how an individual’s level of financial resources affects the
sensitivity of their consumption to paycheck receipt. Their model shows that sophisticates, but

Page 32

not naïfs, will act more patiently when there are more resources available. They examine credit
card payments and compare self-set debt paydown plans to actual behavior. While many users
fail to follow through, individuals their method identifies as sophisticates are in fact more likely
to stick to their plan.
Open Questions #5: Why don’t people learn and anticipate their present-focused behavior?
What can help people correctly anticipate their future present-focused behavior?
There are a number of open questions about naiveté. Given that individuals repeatedly make
consumption decisions, it is perhaps surprising that they do not learn (more quickly) about their
miscalibrated beliefs. One hypothesis is that individuals do learn, but learn in narrow, domainspecific contexts. Therefore, they do not learn generally about the fact they make presentfocused decisions. Under this hypothesis, individuals might learn that they will procrastinate on
preparing for exams, but when they encounter a new decision (e.g. job search), they don’t realize
they will procrastinate. Yet we see naiveté even in contexts where individuals have experience
(e.g. students in the study of Wong 2008), so they may not even learn in specific domains. It is
likely that wishful thinking plays some role here. People would like to believe in a rosy future,
and naïve beliefs help to make that possible. This would explain why people are asymmetrically
naïve about their own future behavior, and not about the behavior of others (see Fedyk 2018).

3.6.

The Effect of Transactions Costs

Empirical Regularity #6: Small changes in transactions costs often have large effects on
behavior.
The behavioral economics literature has emphasized that small changes in transactions costs or
choice architecture sometimes have anomalously large changes on behavior (for reviews see
Thaler and Sunstein 2008 or Beshears et al 2018, which is Chapter 3 of Volume 1 of this
Handbook). Default settings (Madrian and Shea, 2001; Johnson and Goldstein, 2003; Beshears
et al 2009; Choi, Laibson, Madrian, 2009) are posed as the canonical example of such effects.
For example, setting a default of non-enrollment in a 401(k) plan leads to a participation rate of
approximately 40% after one year of tenure as an employee. By contrast, setting a default of
enrollment (and letting employees opt out if they prefer), leads to a participation rate of
approximately 90% after one year of tenure. Results like this have been reproduced in dozens of
studies (for a meta-analysis see Jachimowicz et al 2018).36
Other examples of highly impactful transaction cost manipulations abound. For example,
offering parents of a high school senior immediate assistance and a streamlined process to
complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, raised the likelihood that their child
completed (at least) two years of college from 28% to 36% (Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos,
Sanbonmatsu, 2012). Enabling individuals to almost effortlessly opt into a retirement savings
Note however that defaults have complex distal effects that often dilute their impact (Abadie and Gay 2006;
Beshears et al 2018; Choukhmane 2018).

plan at a pre-selected contribution rate and asset allocation, increased enrollment rates by 10 to
20 percentage points (Beshears et al 2013). Enabling students to send an extra free ACT report
to a college (rather than charging $6 for that marginal report), led ACT-takers to send more
reports and applications relative to SAT-takers, widening the range of colleges they sent scores
to and improving admissions to selective colleges (Pallais 2015). Related effects have been
observed in take-up of social benefits (Currie 2004; Aizer 2007; Bhargava and Manoli 2015) and
medical adherence (Thornton 2008; Banerjee et al. 2010; Milkman et al. 2011, 2013).
Open Question #6: Is the large effect of small transactions costs on behavior primarily
related to present focus, or is it some other channel?
The outsized impact of small incentives, including disincentives like transactions costs, is likely
due to many different mechanisms. Present bias (and other closely related present-focused
mechanisms) have been used to explain why agents are particularly responsive to immediate
transactions costs and immediate rewards for task completion (e.g., Carroll et al 2009). These
immediate transaction costs can be particularly impactful because they lead agents who are
partially or fully naïve to postpone doing the task because they falsely believe that they are going
to complete the task in the near future (e.g., Akerlof 1991; O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999). This
catalyzes a long (or even infinite) cycle of self-defeating procrastination. Related empirical
evidence points to present bias as a key mechanism that explains why transactions costs (and
defaults specifically) are so effective in influencing behavior (e.g., Brown and Previtero 2016;
Goda et al 2018; Blumenstock, Callen, and Ghani, 2018).
However, there are other mechanisms that are also probably important. For example, status quo
bias (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988) is likely driven by many complementary channels (not
just present-focused preferences), including confusion, anchoring effects (e.g., Bernheim,
Fradkin, and Popov, 2015), endorsement effects (e.g., Benartzi 2001; Brown, Liang, and
Weisbenner 2007; Beshears et al. 2008), and inattention/memory (e.g., Gabaix 2014, Ericson
2017).
As nudges become increasingly popular in the policy context, it will be useful to identify the rich
set of mechanisms that cause these nudges to be effective. Unpacking the many complementary
mechanisms and identifying their quantitative contribution will be important as we push this
research program forward.

3.7.

Lack of liquidity on household balance sheets

Empirical Regularity #7: Households tend to hold very low levels of liquid assets.
Households around the world tend to hold very low levels of liquid assets, despite the fact that
they tend to hold relatively large stocks of illiquid assets. These facts are compiled in Chapter 3
of Volume 1 of this Handbook (Beshears et al 2018, Table 1 and Appendix A), and we quickly
touch on them here as well. These results are derived from the 2016 (U.S.) Survey of Consumer
Finances.

Page 34

The median value of net liquid assets starts at $1,000 for households in the 21-30 age category
and rises to $6,719 for households in the 61-70 age category. (Other percentiles are presented in
Chapter 3 of Volume 1.) Accordingly, even households on the brink of retirement have little
liquid net worth.
On the other hand, total net worth (which includes illiquid assets nets out corresponding
collateralized liabilities, and excludes Social Security claims, which are involuntarily
accumulated) shows robust growth over the life course. The median value of total net worth
starts at $7,611 for households in the 21-30 age category and rises to $209,227 in the 61-70 age
category.
These results jointly imply that the typical U.S. household is living without a large buffer of
liquid assets and doing almost all of its voluntary wealth accumulation in illiquid assets.
The financial health of U.S. households appears more strained when debt is broken out of the
balance sheet. In any given month, half of households are borrowing on at least one of their
credit cards (i.e., not making their full payment when they pay their card – see Zinman 2015 and
Laibson, Maxted, Repetto, and Tobacman 2017). Finally, in any given year 12 million U.S.
households (5% of the adult population) take out a payday loan (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2012).
About one million households file for personal bankruptcy each year and one in ten households
has filed for bankruptcy at some point in their lives (Stavins, 2000).
As a corollary to these low levels of liquid wealth (and high levels of borrowing), households
also tend to have anomalously high propensities to consume out of changes in liquid wealth,
whether that change in liquidity is anticipated or unanticipated (e.g., Shea 1995; Gross and
Souleles 2002; Stephens 2003; Shapiro and Slemrod 2003; Shapiro 2005; Mastrobuoni and
Weinberg 2009; Parker et al. 2013; Broda and Parker 2014; Ganong and Noel 2017; Gross,
Notowidigdo, Wang 2016).
Aguiar and Hurst (2005) offer a countervailing view, emphasizing that the simultaneous fall in
income and consumption expenditure at retirement does not coincide with a fall in caloric
consumption. They argue that the systemic drop in consumption expenditure is not anomalous
because households maintain a smooth consumption of calories between the pre- and postretirement periods (by shopping more frugally and doing more home production of meals).
However, Stephens and Toohey (2018) are unable to replicate this caloric-smoothing result using
new data and instead find that caloric intake falls as households enter retirement (mirroring the
fall in consumption expenditure).
Open Question #7: Why do households have such low levels of liquid net wealth, relatively
high levels of illiquid net wealth, and high marginal propensities to consume out of liquid
wealth changes?
These stylized facts are particularly hard to explain because these empirical regularities tend to
occur in the same households. For example, households that borrow on their credit cards tend to
also accumulate large stocks of illiquid wealth (see Laibson, Maxted, Repetto and Tobacman

Page 35

2017). Accordingly, household heterogeneity can offer only a partial explanation of these
regularities.
In the behavioral economics literature, the principle explanation for these balance sheet and
consumption facts has been present bias (Laibson, 1997, Angeletos et al 2001; Skiba and
Tobacman, 2008; Laibson, Maxted, Repetto, and Tobacman, 2017). Households with present
bias have a hard time holding on to liquid assets, which tend to get quickly spent on consumption
expenditures. Indeed, households with present bias (e.g., 𝛽 0.8 will tend to borrow on credit
cards. However, present biased households will be willing to invest in illiquid assets (including
durables) with modest rates of return, because the household’s long-run discount rate is only
ln 𝛿 ≅ 1 𝛿, which is typically estimated to be below the long-run real (after-tax, risk adjusted)
return that households can obtain on assets like housing or (matched) 401(k) contributions.
Laibson, Maxted, Repetto and Tobcaman (2017) use the method of simulated moments to
estimate preference parameters in a lifecycle consumption model. Using data on voluntary
wealth formation and credit card borrowing to identify preference parameters, they estimate
β=0.51, δ=0.99, and a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1.3.
Models outside the behavioral literature have taken a different approach to explaining low levels
of liquidity, high levels of borrowing, high levels of illiquid wealth formation and the high
marginal propensity to consume out of changes in liquidity. For example, Kaplan and Violante
(2014) assume that the real, after-tax return on liquid wealth is -1.48%, the real, after-tax interest
rate on credit card borrowing is 6%, and the real, after-tax and risk-adjusted return on illiquid
assets is 6.29%, generating a high level of credit card borrowing, little liquid wealth buffering,
and aggressive investment in illiquid assets (see also and Kaplan, Violante and Weidner, 2014).
Future work will continue to explore the mechanisms that explain the balance sheet behavior and
consumption dynamics of households.

3.8.

Commitment

Empirical Regularity #8: People sometimes demand commitment devices.
Many of the theories that generate present-focused preferences predict that, under the right
circumstances, agents will choose commitment ‘for its own sake’ (see Table 1 in Section 2.7).
By this we mean that agents will prefer to restrict their choice set holding all else equal, which
we refer to as a pure commitment. For present-biased agents, such a restriction prevents them
from making a suboptimal choice in the future (e.g., a pre-paid or shame-inducing gym trainer
forces one to exercise; likewise an irreversible temporary web-or phone-blocker like Freedom
keeps one on task). For agents with temptation (see Section 2.2), commitment removes
temptation costs, which can be beneficial even if the tempting good is not chosen when it is
available.

Page 36

Agents sometimes do choose pure commitments that are not confounded by tied inducements,
like financial incentives,37 but such pure commitments are rarely observed in markets (Laibson,
2015). When trying to identify pure commitments in the field, only a handful come to mind, such
as web blockers, which do not seem to be used widely, even in developed economies.38 We
suspect that personal trainers are also hired mostly for their commitment effects, though this is
not an example of a pure commitment.
Most practical “commitments” seem to be corrupted by impurities. For example, standard
amortization mortgages (with fixed payments that end when the principle is repaid) are
sometimes advocated in the financial advice literature as a forcing mechanism that helps people
with self-control problems systematically shed their housing debt. But mortgages are also a taxadvantaged financing vehicle for home buying. So it’s not clear why people take them up: to
solve a self-control problem or, simply, to get tax advantaged financing. Perhaps the lack of
popularity of interest-only mortgages provides a hint that amortization mortgages deliver some
special benefits, but such an inference is somewhat speculative.
Some other apparent commitments may simply arise from naiveté. For example, Wertenbroch
(1998) documents that consumers prefer to buy vice goods in small packages and virtue goods in
large (volume discount) packages, which is reflected in firms’ pricing decisions. These patterns
could arise because of commitment or because consumers naively anticipate that they won’t
want to eat more than a small serving of ice cream and accordingly buy ice cream in packages
that forego volume discounts. If you think you are only going to eat ice cream today (because
you believe you will prefer to eat healthfully tomorrow), then you should buy only a small
container of ice cream. Hence, small packaging could be a sign of commitment or it could be a
sign of naiveté.
The commitment evidence from experiments is less muddy. In lab studies and field experiments
researchers have been able to systematically observe pure commitment behavior (e.g., see Ariely
and Wertenbroch 2002; Ashraf, Karlan, and Yang 2006; Bryan, Karlan and Nelson, 2010;
Houser, Schunk, Winter, and Xiao, 2018; Gine, Karlan, and Zinman 2010; Kaur, Kremer, and
Mullainathan 2010, 2015; Royer, Stehr, and Sydnor, 2015; Bisin and Hyndman 2018;
Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger 2015; Alsan et al, 2017; Casaburi and Macchiavello
forthcoming; Schilbach forthcoming; Beshears et al, 2018). For example, Schilbach
(forthcoming), implements a field study in which the experimental participants are rickshaw
drivers in India, a population with a high level of alcohol consumption. Schilbach finds
economically (and statistically) significant demand for a pure commitment device. About a third
of study subjects choose to forgo about 10% of their daily incomes for a week to receive
monetary payments conditional on zero blood alcohol test that would otherwise be received
unconditionally.

For example, a 401(k) savings plan is an impure commitment, because it is tied to financial incentives like
matching dollars and favorable tax treatment, so it is not clear whether people invest money in 401(k)’s for their
commitment properties or despite them.
38
Other exotic examples include a series of alarm clocks that jump off the night table and run around the bedroom
until the groggy sleeper chases them down. Such alarm clocks do exist, but they appear to have a limited market.
Likewise, the commitment website stickK has not gone viral.
37

Page 37

Open Question #8: Why is pure commitment so rare in markets and why is willingness to
pay for commitment usually so low (even in lab experiments designed to measure the taste
for commitment)?
As noted above, pure commitment is rarely observed in organic (‘real-world’) markets that have
not been designed by behavioral economists (e.g., Bernheim, Meer, and Novarro, 2016). While
pure commitment is routinely observed in lab and field experiments (see the list above),
willingness to pay for such commitment is typically zero (e.g., Augenblick, Niederle and
Sprenger 2015). In other words, the typical experimental participant is not willing to pay for the
privilege of tying their hands (by committing to a particular outcome that is strictly dominated by
what they could have achieved without commitment). Only a handful of studies reveal a
substantial willingness to pay for commitment: e.g., Casaburi and Macchiavello (forthcoming),
and Beshears et al (2018), report that an overwhelming majority of participants are willing to pay
for commitment, and Schilbach (forthcoming) finds that a third of subjects are willing to pay
10% of their daily income for commitment.
There are several hypotheses for the overall pattern of weak demand for commitment (see
Laibson 2015, 2018). First, agents may be fully or partially naïve. Second, commitment may be
costly to generate (e.g., personal trainers). Third, extrinsic uncertainty may make commitment
suboptimal (if the commitment technology can’t condition on all states of nature). Fourth, many
types of commitment may already be embedded in other institutions that serve multiple purposes.
For example, the 401(k) system provides both a commitment technology – penalties for early
withdrawal – and a saving subsidy, crowding out incipient demand for a pure commitment
technology (e.g., a savings account that is illiquid and offers no saving subsidy). Many social
institutions may have this hybrid property of providing commitment and other services. For
example, many large employers provide multiple forcing mechanisms that counteract workers’
self-control problems (e.g., deadlines, progress reports, retirement savings programs, etc. – see
Laibson 2018). Finally, self control may be achieved through internal punishments instead of
external commitment technologies (see Bernheim, Ray, and Yeltekin 2015).

3.9.

Paternalistic Policy and Welfare

Empirical Regularity #9: Many public policies seem paternalistic and aimed at addressing
present-focused behavior.
Many government policies seem rooted in a paternalistic desire to at least partially offset presentfocused behavior. The most explicit is provision for retirement: in the U.S., social security
benefits offer protection to myopic or present-focused individuals who do not save for
retirement. Indeed, as far back as in Feldstein (1985), setting the optimal level of social security
benefits was discussed as a tradeoff of benefits for myopic individuals against costs from
distorting private saving and other economic behavior. Illiquid defined contribution retirement
savings accounts also help provide a commitment device for savers. Laibson, Repetto, and
Tobacman et al. (1998) show that this commitment can be appealing for present-biased
individuals. (Note that U.S. accounts are more liquid than in some other developed countries; see

Page 38

Beshears et al. (2015) for a discussion.) Several recent papers have acquired that illiquid
accounts and compulsory savings are an optimal response if agents have present-biased
preferences (e.g., Amador, Werning, and Angeletos 2006; Moser and Olea de Souza e Silva
2017; Beshears et al 2018).
Compulsory education laws are also naturally—and often explicitly—explained as a counter to
present-focused decisions of children (see Lavecchia, Liu, and Oreopoulos 2014). Restrictions on
payday borrowing as well as caps on interest rates (usury laws) can be motivated in part by an
intent to counter present-focused behavior (see e.g. Skiba 2012 on what restrictions on payday
lending can be rationalized by present-focused behavior and what cannot).
Paternalism can interact with present-focused behavior to lead to somewhat surprising
predictions: for instance, Lockwood (2016) shows that with present-bias can lead to optimal tax
policy to have negative marginal tax rates at low incomes, similar to the design of the Earned
Income Tax Credit in the U.S.
The existence of paternalistic policy plus naiveté about present-focus may at first seem a puzzle,
but recall that individuals are better a predicting the present-focus of others than themselves, and
these laws can be interpreted as paternalistic control of others, rather than a preference for
commitment (Fedyk 2018; also see Albrecht et al 2011). Moreover, Laibson (2018) shows that
naïve individuals can use model-free forecasts to choose contexts (e.g. firms/employers) that
have a reputation for generating satisfaction. In this case, individuals don’t want paternalism, but
do want institutions that produce benefits for the stakeholders (whether or not the paternalism is
made explicit).
Open Question #9: What welfare criterion should we use to evaluate intertemporal
tradeoffs?
A welfare criterion is needed in order to evaluate policy. While economists often rely on
revealed preference, dynamically inconsistent preferences pose new challenges and how to
evaluate welfare is disputed. Suppose an individual plans to contribute to a retirement savings
plan next month (a patient choice), but when next month arrives changes her plans and spends
the money (an impatient choice). Which choice makes the individual better off? Revealed
preference has no obvious answer.
Normative analysis for intertemporal choice has been discussed through the lens of present bias
(Laibson 1997). A common choice is to simply evaluate welfare from the long-run perspective
(setting β=1), on the grounds that these are the preferences that are persistent; an alternative is
the multi-self Pareto-criterion, which treats each self as different person (e.g., Laibson, Repetto,
and Tobacman 1998).
There is a fundamental philosophical debate about the extent to which observed choices should
be linked to normative preferences. Bernheim and Rangel (2009) and Bernheim (2016) argue
that normative evaluation must be linked to choice and propose a welfare criterion that never
overrules a choice; as a result, it is sometimes undiscerning (i.e., cannot rank two outcomes). In
contrast, Beshears et al (2008) argue that normative preferences (that represent an individual’s
actual interests and that should be used for analysis) can diverge from revealed preferences (that

Page 39

rationalize an action), and propose a variety of ways of identifying normative preferences. (See
also Sugden 2004.) See the Handbook chapter in Volume 1 on Behavioral Public Economics
(Bernheim and Taubinsky 2018) for more discussion of these issues.
The existence of paternalistic policies may reflect some important information about the
appropriate welfare criteria: voters seem to demand and policy-makers seem to create
paternalistic policies. It is an open question how informative the existence of paternalistic
policies should be for informing welfare judgments. Policy can be mistaken, or policy may be
insightful, or, most likely a bit of both. We might also be able to make inferences (in part) from
the retirement savings systems and other human resource norms that have been developed by
non-profit institutions that are concerned about the well-being of their employees (beyond the
universal issues of recruitment and retention).
There has been a long tradition of not using revealed preference estimates of discount rates for
normative analysis. Sen (1957) argues that the social discount rate should differ from the
individual discount rate— “for, among other things, while the individuals die the nation does
not.” Schelling (1995) notes the importance of conceptually distinguishing pure time preference
for one’s own consumption from preferences for redistribution across generations, while Gollier
(2013) highlights that the discount rate that should be used for an investment project depends on
whether the project is financed by reducing current consumption or reallocating productive
capital. Relatedly, Goulder and Williams (2012) similarly distinguish between a social-welfare
discount rate and finance discount rate based on the marginal product of capital.
This normative discount rate has been particularly important for evaluating climate change and
potential policy responses. Stern (2007, 2008) highlights how the social and private discount
rates are distinct concepts; market interest rates reflect the private decisions of individuals but are
not necessarily informative of the social discount rate, which also reflects ethical
considerations.39

3.10.

Preference for Improving Sequences

Empirical Regularity #10: Individuals typically display both impatience and preferences
for improvement over time.
Typically, individuals have (weakly) positive time preference: all else equal, they would rather
have something earlier rather than later. However, there is one important exception: individuals
seem to prefer sequences of outcomes that improve over time. For instance, Barsky et al (1997)
show that participants prefer their real consumption path either to be flat or to rise over time (the
modal subject prefers to it be flat, but the mean is a rising profile); when the real interest rate is
zero, impatience and standard assumptions of separable discounted utility would predict a
declining consumption profile. Similarly, Loewenstein and Sicherman (1991) show that
However, even if the social discount rate is lower than the market interest rate, a policy maker might still wish to
use the market interest rate as a return hurdle. Why invest in a public project with social return 𝑟 when there exists a
𝑟 that the government could pursue instead (Cropper
private project that can be used to generate a social return 𝑟
and Laibson 1999)?

39

Page 40

participants prefer an increasing wage profile,40 and Chapman (2000) shows that subjects
typically prefer improving sequences of health outcomes (e.g. headaches that get better over time
rather than worse).
Open question #10: How do we integrate models of discounting with the other factors
leading to a preference for improving sequences? When does a preference for an improving
sequence become important relative to discounting?
Loewenstein and Prelec (1993) identified three related motivations for preferring an improving
sequence: anticipatory utility, reference points, and a recency effect in evaluating experiences.
Anticipatory utility can lead to preferences for improving sequences, if individuals prefer
delaying pleasurable experiences so that they can savor them (Loewenstein 1987, see also Caplin
and Leahy 2001); for instance, people prefer to delay receiving kiss from a movie star by a few
days, while also preferring to get through a painful shock immediately. Loss aversion with
respect to reference points based on past consumption—adaptive reference points41— can also
lead to a preference for increasing consumption, as can habit-based models (Ryder and Heal
1973, Abel 1990). Finally, because experiences may be evaluated with a “peak-end” rule
(Kahneman et al 1993), individuals may prefer a better ending over a better beginning. It would
be useful to quantitatively incorporate these motivations into a model of intertemporal choice
that also involves discounting.
Moreover, Frederick and Loewenstein (2008) show that elicitation method matters for
preferences over sequences: when choosing among sequences that differ in trend, people prefer
increasing sequences; with other elicitation methods (allocation or pricing tasks), the preference
for improving sequences disappears. If different motivations become salient with different tasks,
which tasks best reflect economically relevant decisions?

How Soon Is Now?

Open Question #11: How soon is “now”? How fast does value decline over time?
What is the duration of the “present” for present-focused models? Using a present-biased (i.e.,
quasi-hyperbolic) discounting model requires distinguishing between “now” and later. Of course,
this discretization of time into the present versus the future is a simplification, but even a
generalized hyperbolic discounting model requires a calibration of how fast value declines as
you move forward.
Evidence on preferences over consumption suggests an extremely quick drop off in value
overtime, on the order of minutes. McClure et al. (2007) examined choices over juice and water
Read and Powell (2002) elicit verbal reasons for subjects’ choices over sequences over money, and find that
subjects typically match income to desired consumption.

consumption for thirsty subject and found strong preference for drinking “now” versus more in 5
minutes, but substantially more patient choices between 20 and 25 minutes in the future.
Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger (2015) examine choices over when to exert effort and find
present-bias for effort “now” (to be started in a few minutes) versus weeks later. Recently,
Augenblick (2018) traces out discounting over effort tasks at short horizons (hours and days) and
finds a discount factor of 0.94 for a delay of a few hours, 0.91 for one day, and 0.87 for one
week. However, the interpretation of these results depends on the extent to which individuals can
substitute effort across time; while today’s plans may be fixed, individuals may respond to
increased requirements for effort in experiments in the future by reducing effort in other areas of
their life.
A different picture emerges for discounting of monetary payments, which could be a result of a
distinction between preferences over consumption versus financial flows. Balakrishnan,
Haushofer, and Jakiela (2017) measure MEL choices using the convex time budget, comparing
immediate payments, end of day payments, and future payments (using electronic payments for
Kenyan subjects). They find little present-bias for end of day payments (about 4 hours delay) but
do find present bias for immediate payments (𝛽 around 0.9).42 In contrast, structural models with
annual periods (e.g. Angeletos et al. 2001) implicitly treat consumption anytime “this year” as
immediate. The connection between the assumptions of these structural models and the
experimental literature remains to be explored.
If there is limited present-bias beyond horizons of a few hours, the impact of present-bias on
many decisions seems limited. For instance, purchasing goods online, even with next-day
delivery, wouldn’t provide an immediate reward. Many expensive, durable goods (cars,
computers) are only received at hours or days delay, and even clothing is not usually worn
immediately after being purchased. However, there may be some transactional utility that makes
the purchase of certain goods pleasurable in itself – i.e., buying a sports car or a special piece of
clothing.

4.2.

The Role of Temptation

Open Question #12: What types of decisions involve temptation? How quantitatively
important is temptation (as opposed to present-bias)?
Intuition suggests that there is a cost to resisting temptation that is not captured in discounted
utility models (whether they be time-consistent or present-biased), since in these discounted
utility models the outcome (and not the cognitive process that gets the household to that endpoint) solely determines an individual’s welfare. Suppose you choose fruit as an afternoon snack;
in a discounted utility model, your welfare is the same regardless of whether fruit was the only
option, or you chose fruit over an unhealthy (but delicious) alternative. An alternative class of

Similarly, Andreoni and Sprenger (2012) find no present-bias for payments made via check at the end of the day.
However, Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger (2015) made immediate monetary payments in cash and found β near
1 for money.

42

models allows for the possibility that resisting an unchosen alternative is costly (e.g. Gul and
Pesendorfer (2001), Fudenberg and Levine (2006)).
Toussaert (2018) provides evidence on the existence of costly temptation. Participants in her
experiment chose between either reading a story (the potentially “tempting” alternative) or
completing a task for pay. About a third of her subjects preferred to limit their options for future
work so that they could not read the story. This could be explained by either a desire to remove a
tempting alternative that is costly to resist, or as a commitment device to change their future
behavior. However, Toussaert shows that the desire to limit their options wasn’t driven by a
desire to change their future behavior, since most participants predicted that they would do the
task even if they had a choice. Moreover, consistent with a cost of resisting temptation, task
performance was lower when participants were assigned to have the option to stop the task and
read the story (even though they kept doing the task).
Other research also provides suggestive evidence that individuals want to limit their option set
not merely to change their outcome but to reduce their costs of exercising self-control. Sadoff,
Samek, & Sprenger (2015) examine the desire for commitment to healthy v. unhealthy foods in a
food delivery service, and find that individuals who demand commitment are more likely to
be dynamically consistent in their prior behavior. Similarly, examining gym attendance, Royer,
Stehr, and Sydnor (2015) write, “we observe demand for commitment by those who appear on
the surface not to need it.” This is hard to explain through the lens of present-biased discounted
utility models but is naturally explained by models of costly temptation.
It is an open question how important temptation costs are for policy. Toussaert (2018) provides
evidence of the existence of temptation, but the design had to be carefully constructed to rule out
the alternative story in which participants demand commitment because they fear they might
give in and choose the tempting alternative. Thus, her context has a tempting task where, perhaps
unusually, people almost always resist temptation. Toussaert’s design also likely estimates a
lower bound on the role of temptation, since it is joint test for both temptation preference and
sophistication about those preferences: subjects have to predict that they will face costs of selfcontrol. However, the literature examining time discounting and present-bias has typically found
substantial naiveté (see Section 3.5).
It is difficult to distinguish costly temptation from other models such as present-bias (and note,
the existence of costly temptation doesn’t rule out an important role for present-bias). Indeed,
under certain conditions, Krusell, Kuruscu, and Smith (2010) show for strong enough costs of
temptation (such that you always give in), behavior will be equivalent to that of present bias.43 A
smoking gun indicator for costly temptation is a willingness-to-pay to remove tempting things
from your choice set that you wouldn’t choose anyway. But it is difficult to distinguish that
motivation from willingness-to-pay for commitment if there is a small likelihood that you
succumb to temptation. Future work may explore biometric data and subjective wellbeing
measures to help measure pure temptation effects.

Krusell, Kuruscu, and Smith (2010) show this equivalent for consumption choice under constant-relative-risk
aversion preferences. It is unclear how general result can be made.

Large temptation costs could impact the evaluation of many policies, since in these models even
options that are rarely if ever chosen could have substantial welfare impacts. Hence, smoking
bans might increase the welfare of former smokers who have quit, but who no longer have to
resist the temptation of smoking. The availability of social media on smart phones might reduce
welfare, even when people aren’t using their cell phones. Finally, deadlines might be valuable
because they lower the self-control costs of working on a project, even if they don’t ultimately
change when the project is completed.

4.3.
Other mechanisms and complementary psychological
conceptions
Open Question #13: How important are a variety of mechanisms for intertemporal choice,
including probability weighting, trust, and heuristics, both in the lab and in the field? What
role do alternative psychological conceptions play in intertemporal choice?
Discounted utility (as well as other models of present-focus) is fundamentally a theory of time
preference. Yet intertemporal choices also reflect other factors, such as risk, heuristics, or even
framing that are distinct from pure time preference. We do not yet have a clear picture of how
quantitatively important these other factors are.
Risk
An alternative motivation for discounting the receipt of future rewards is that the reward may
disappear—e.g. the payment may not be made, or the individual may die, etc.44 A common
concern in interpreting MEL tasks is whether subjects trust that payments will be delivered, and
experimenters attempt to maintain high reliability in when payments are received. Risk that a
future reward might disappear can lead to discounting apart from pure time preference, as
discussed in Section 1.4.
Other work moves beyond expected utility models. Halevy (2008) argues that the present is
different from the future in that the future is uncertain; in non-expected utility models, this can
lead to diminishing impatience (see also Saito 2011). Along these lines, Epper, Fehr-Duda, and
Bruhin (2011) show experimental evidence that individuals who are prone to more probability
distortions also discount money more hyperbolically, and show that, since future events are
uncertain, probability distortions can lead to hyperbolic discounting.
Other work shows interactions between risk and time that are not predicted by expected utility.
For instance, Anderson and Stafford (2009) find that the presence of risk makes individuals less
patient (adjusting for the level of risk); see also Ahlbrecht and Weber (1997). Andreoni and
Sprenger (2012b) show that participants seem to display a preference for certainty, though
Cheung (2015) shows that those results are at least partially driven by a motive for diversifying
across dates and thereby hedging payment risk (because the risks are independent); see also Miao
and Zhong (2015) and a reply by Andreoni and Sprenger (2015).
McGuire and Kable (2013) argue that behavior in the original marshmallow task are driven by trust and changing
beliefs about how long it would be necessary to wait for the larger reward.

44

Heuristics
It may be cognitively difficult to discount. For instance, evidence on exponential growth bias
(Stango and Zinman 2009) indicates that people get exponentiation wrong and tend to linearize
exponential functions; this poses a challenge for discounted utility models. Given cognitive
difficulties, individuals may rely on heuristics. Various models of intertemporal choice heuristics
have been proposed in which choice is a function of proportional and absolute differences on
time and reward dimension, as well as other factors (Read et al. 2013, Ericson et al 2015).
Ericson et al. (2015) conduct a cross-validated intertemporal choice model comparison showing
that heuristic models predict better out of sample than discounted utility models, though Wulff
and van den Bos (2017) show that some of their results depend on the model of noise and
individual heterogeneity.
Heuristic models of intertemporal choice seem promising but are currently limited in their
applicability. It remains an open question whether heuristic models generalize beyond lab-based
MEL choices. Can economists use them to explain any other behaviors? Moreover, it may be
fruitful to develop a model that nests both heuristics and discounted utility, allowing researchers
to estimate a parameter capturing the extent of deviation from expected utility.
Other Theories
Alongside the economics literature is a psychological literature examining intertemporal choice,
and it may be fruitful to examine the relationship between the psychological and economic
models.45 For instance, personality psychology characterizes individuals not via their discount
factor, but via concepts such as conscientiousness and grit.46 Conscientiousness is one of the “big
five” personality measures, and may include some aspects of self-control (Roberts et al 2005).
Grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, has been argued to be distinct
from self-control (Duckworth and Gross 2014) and associated with measures of life success
(Duckworth et al 2007). How does grit translate into an economic model? Can grit be captured
by a utility function that places less weight on the cost of effort? Or is grit an increased ability to
forecast and make salient future benefits of present costly actions?
Other work examines factors that affect the construction of intertemporal choice. Query theory
(Weber et al. 2007, Appelt, Hardisty, and Weber 2011) can be used to understand the process of
making an intertemporal choice. Weber et al. (2007) show that manipulating the order in which
individuals think of different reasons for their choice can lead to more or less impulsivity.
Another line of work examines the role of emotion in intertemporal choice, showing that sadness
increases impatience (Lerner, Li, and Weber 2013) and that gratitude decreases impatience
(DeSteno, Li, Dickens, and Lerner 2014).

Stability and Domain Generality

Open Question #14: How stable are time preferences? How general are they across
domains?
In discounted utility models, time preference applies to utility, and so the same discount factor
applies to all domains of choice. Yet it is an open question whether different types of
consumption are discounted in similar ways.
Cohen, Ericson, Laibson, and White (2016) review how predictive money-earlier-or-later (MEL)
studies are for other domains. Many studies show that impatience in MEL tasks is weakly
correlated with other behaviors. For instance, Meier and Sprenger (2011) find that MEL
discounting is correlated with individuals’ credit scores, and a series of papers shows that
children’s MEL choices predict future behavior (Bettinger and Slonim 2007, Castillo et al. 2011,
Sutter et al. 2013, Golsteyn, Gronqvist and Lindahl 2013).47 Aggregating field behaviors into
single indices increases the correlation with MEL behavior (Chabris et al 2008). However, as
discussed previously, preferences over the timing of money receipt can (and should in an
optimizing model) diverge from preferences over other rewards, since receipt of money is not the
same as consumption.
There is limited work comparing consumption-based measures of time preference to field
behavior. A classic non-monetary task is the marshmallow test (Mischel and Ebbesen 1970,
Mischel, Shoda, and Rodriguez 1989), which is correlated with personality scales that measure
self-regulatory capacity; it has some predictive power for early-life outcomes (Shoda, Mischel,
and Peake 1990, Watts, Duncan, and Quan 2018) and no predictive power for mid-life outcomes
(Benjamin et al 2018). Burks et al. (2012) develop an analogue of the marshmallow task, in
which individuals trade off waiting longer for monetary compensation. They conclude that while
this measure is correlated with smoking, it “does not predict outcomes very well”, and that a
quasi-hyperbolic model measured from MEL choices does a better job.
It would be interesting to examine how time preferences over different domains of consumption
are correlated, but evidence is limited here. A number of studies examine money and another
domain (e.g. health and money in Chapman 1996 or effort and money in Augenblick, Niederle,
and Sprenger 2015). Other studies examine field behaviors that could be a function of time
preferences but also other factors (e.g. smoking, obesity; see Chabris et al 2008, Falk et al 2015,
2016). The best evidence on discounting of different types of goods comes from developing
countries. Ubfal (2016) estimates good specific discount rates (e.g. for sugar, rice, meat) and
rejects hypothesis that discount rates are the same across goods.
Correlations between measured time preference (whatever the method) and field behaviors have
multiple interpretations, as behaviors in both the lab and field are functions not only of time
preference, but also cognitive ability, knowledge, beliefs, and preferences. For instance, more
Another type of correlation is between measures of restlessness, aggression, or impulsivity in children and their
future outcomes (Cadena and Keys 2012, Moffit et al 2011); it is unclear how to interpret these measures in a model
of discounting utility.

47

patient MEL behavior is correlated with measures of cognitive ability (Burks et al. 2009,
Dohmen et al. 2010, and Benjamin, Brown, and Shapiro 2013). Thus, unconditional correlations
between MEL behavior and other behaviors include some effect of cognitive ability. Why
cognitive ability and MEL behavior are correlated is another puzzle. One explanation is that
more patience leads to more investment in human capital. An alternative explanation is that
higher cognitive ability makes it more likely that individuals treat MEL decisions “rationally” as
a financing decision rather than a consumption decision; their choices thus reveal their market
interest rate rather than a discount rate for utils.
Finally, the role of noise in eliciting or constructing preference may be important. Test-retest
correlations of discount rates measured from MEL behavior are similar to other personality
measures: 0.6 to 0.8 in Kirby (2009), and 0.5 in Meier and Sprenger (2015). Yet it is also rare
that a discounting model strongly predicts an individual’s choices; the form of noise used to
estimate discounting parameters can be quite important. For instance, it may matter whether
noise is additive (so that as rewards are scaled up, an individual is less likely to make a
“mistake”) or multiplicative (so that mistakes are equally likely for high stakes choices), or some
hybrid case.

4.5.

Malleability and self-management

Open Question #15: How malleable is time preference? How effective are self-management
techniques?
Commitment is one self-management strategy. Yet there are other ways individuals might alter
their intertemporal choices.
Early childhood interventions have been shown to have large impacts on later life outcomes;
much of this effect comes from non-cognitive skills, potentially including self-regulation and/or
time preference (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua 2006). However, we are unaware of direct
evidence showing the effect of early childhood interventions on conventional measures of time
preference (MEL or real consumption choices). Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev (2013) show that
an early childhood intervention improved academic motivation (e.g. “showing initiative”) and
externalizing behaviors (e.g. disruption of class, aggressive behaviors) that seem plausibly
related to time preference or self-control.
One hypothesis is that cognitive load can affect impatience, a prediction that can be produced by
cost-of-self-control models. The evidence here is mixed. Deck and Jahedi (2015) provide
experimental evidence that increasing cognitive load leads to more impatience over money, but
not over consumption goods (see also Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999, Hinson, Jameson, and Whitney
2003).48 Closely connected is the hypothesis that scarcity leads to myopic or impatient behavior,
supported by experimental studies (Shah, Mullainathan, and Shafir 2012; see also Haushofer and
Fehr 2014). Carvalho, Meier, and Wang (2015) examine choices of low-income individuals
Exogenously increasing time for deliberation has been shown to lead to more patient decisions (Dai and Fishbach
2013, Imas, Kuhn, and Mironova 2017).

before versus after payday (generating a short-lived change in financial pressure). They show
that before payday, choices are more impatient over money, but are not more impatient over real
effort tasks; this is naturally explained via liquidity constraints, rather than changing time
preferences.
Other work has shown that a “growth mindset” (a belief that intelligence is malleable rather than
fixed) predicts greater academic performance (Dweck 1986, Blackwell et al., 2007). Metaanalyses have found small effects of mindset interventions (Sisk et al 2018) with larger effects
for low-socio-economic status students. A large-scale replication of a growth-mindset
intervention found significant, though small effects (Yeager et al. 2018). While the growth
mindset is likely best captured as a change in beliefs about self-efficacy and the connection
between effort and reward, it might also impact decisions about self-control. (See also our
discussion of “grit” in Section 13.)

4.6.

Retirement saving adequacy

Open question #16: Are households saving optimally for retirement?
Since the work of Hamermesh (1984) and Mariger (1987) there has been an active literature
studying consumption dynamics around retirement and the closely related question of the
adequacy of household retirement savings.49 There are strong advocates of two positions: that
households save too little and that households save optimally. There is also a small set of papers
that argue that many households are tightwads and accordingly save too much (e.g., Rick,
Cryder, and Loewenstein, 2007).
Many studies have shown that, on average, consumption expenditure falls around retirement
(e.g., Bernheim et al 2001; Angeletos et al 2001; Haider and Stephens Jr., 2007; Olafsson and
Pagel 2018). Many rational mechanisms might explain this drop, including a decline in workrelated expenditures, a shift toward home production (i.e., leisure-consumption substitution), and
a greater propensity to shop for low-cost consumption goods (e.g., more time for coupon
clipping or travelling a greater distance to purchase goods on sale).
Bernheim et al. (2001) show that the decline in consumption expenditure at retirement is not
associated with the decline in work-related expenditures. Relatedly, Ganong and Noel (2017)
show that work-related expenditures do not account for a substantial change in expenditure when
a member of a household separates from an employer.
A hypothesized shift toward home production at retirement, which would smooth total market
and non-market consumption even as market-based consumption expenditure fell, was first
supported by the finding that caloric consumption did not drop at retirement (Aguiar and Hurst
2005). However, subsequent work has challenged that finding with new data (Stephens and
Toohey (2018). It now appears that caloric consumption does fall on average at retirement,
though it is still not clear how to interpret that finding. It is possible that retirees expend less
49

energy than employed people (holding age fixed). It would be useful to longitudinally follow the
caloric intake of a person who is not in the labor force and passes from a period in which their
spouse is employed to a period in which their spouse is retired. Of course, even this empirical
strategy presents confounds if the retirement of one’s spouse changes one’s own level of physical
activity.
There is evidence for the hypothesized mechanism that retirees purchase less expensive goods in
retirement (holding quality fixed): e.g., Aguiar and Hurst (2007), Hurd and Rohwedder (2013)
and Agarwal et al (2015). But it is not clear whether this behavior reflects a rational plan for
lifecycle behavior (i.e., another example of rational substitution between leisure and
consumption expenditure) or the consequence of financial pressure/distress that leads retirees to
search for bargains.
There is also a literature that studies wealth accumulation. For example, Scholz et al (2006) use
a structural model to analyze the optimality of lifecycle wealth formation and report that the vast
majority of households are saving optimally. Here too there are challenges of interpretation.
Key parameters make a large difference in these models (Skinner 2007). For example, if
households experience large incremental costs when they have children, then it is optimal for
expenditure to fall sharply when children leave the home, and by extension for balance sheet
wealth for households on the brink of retirement (who are largely empty nesters) to be low. For
evidence that consumption expenditure changes relatively little when children start to live
independently, see Dushi et al. (2015).
In surveys, households overwhelmingly report that they are saving less than they think they
should (e.g., Bernheim 1991; Bernheim 1995; Farkas and Johnson 1997; Choi et al. 2002),
though it is hard to interpret this attitudinal measure. Such perceived undersaving is consistent
with models of present-bias, which have been used to explain wealth accumulation, credit card
borrowing, and consumption-income comovement, including the drop in consumption
expenditure at retirement (Angeletos et al 2001; Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman 2003; Laibson,
Maxted, Repetto, and Tobacman 2017).
The extreme sensitivity between savings behavior and institutional nudges (e.g., autoenrollment) suggests that savings behavior is not consistent with a rational actor model (e.g.,
Madrian and Shea 2001). But this does not necessarily imply that households are undersaving on
average. It is possible that paternalistic policies (like Social Security and other pensions) are
structured so that on average households accumulate wealth optimally, even though each
individual household is not necessarily at its own private optimum (Fadlon and Laibson, 2018).

5. Conclusion
A set of key stylized facts have been documented in the literature on intertemporal choice. These
facts are largely at odds with the once-dominant exponential discounted utility model. A variety
of models with the feature of present-focus have been developed to describe how humans make
intertemporal choices. While in many cases these models make similar predictions, they have

Page 49

important distinctions that can affect the advice we give individuals, the policies we develop, and
the welfare judgments we make.
As a result, despite a robust literature, there is a need for new empirical evidence to address the
important open questions that we identify and to distinguish among various present-focused
models. There is thus room for much new work in the field of intertemporal choice, which may
be furthered by new experimental paradigms. Much of the laboratory research we review relies
on monetary tradeoffs, but the connection between these money choices and experienced utility
is itself unclear and a subject of ongoing research. Real effort laboratory tasks are a promising
methodology that poses considerable advantages over experiments based on time-linked
monetary payoffs (e.g. Augenblick, Niederle and Sprenger 2015, Augenblick and Rabin 2018,
Fedyk 2018), but these methods are also imperfect. Other sources of data, such as household
balance sheet data (Laibson, Maxted, Repetto, and Tobacman, 2017), spending transactions (e.g.
Ganong and Noel 2017; Kuchler and Pagel 2018) or caloric intake (Aguiar and Hurst 2005;
Stephens and Toohey 2018) will complement the methods that have been deployed in the
historical literature. Ultimately, there probably isn’t a right answer to our methodological quest.
Progress will likely come from many different methods that jointly paint a more complete and
compelling picture of our intertemporal preferences.
