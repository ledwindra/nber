    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a political-economy model of economic union and compare the competion regime to the coordination regime. Key policy differences emerge  between the two  regimes: concerning the generosity of the welfare state and the skill composition of migration. We argue  that the  differences between the U.S. and the EU - the degree of coordination among the member states - contribute to the observed  policy differences, as the model predicts.\n\n",
