ABSTRACT
Entrants and incumbents can create new products and displace the products of competitors.
Incumbents can also improve their existing products. How much of aggregate productivity
growth occurs through each of these channels? Using data from the U.S. Longitudinal Business
Database on all nonfarm private businesses from 1983 to 2013, we arrive at three main
conclusions: First, most growth appears to come from incumbents. We infer this from the modest
employment share of entering firms (defined as those less than 5 years old). Second, most growth
seems to occur through improvements of existing varieties rather than creation of brand new
varieties. Third, own-product improvements by incumbents appear to be more important than
creative destruction. We infer this because the distribution of job creation and destruction has
thinner tails than implied by a model with a dominant role for creative destruction.

Introduction

Innovating firms can improve on existing products made by other firms, thereby
gaining profits at the expense of their competitors. Such creative destruction
plays a central role in many theories of growth. This goes back to at least Schumpeter (1939), carries through to Stokey (1988), Grossman and Helpman (1991),
and Aghion and Howitt (1992), and continues with more recent models such
as Klette and Kortum (2004). Aghion et al. (2014) survey the theory. Acemoglu
and Robinson (2012) provide historical accounts of countries that stop growing
when creative destruction is blocked.
Other growth theories emphasize the importance of firms improving their
own products, rather than displacing other firms’ products. Krusell (1998) and
Lucas and Moll (2014) are examples. Some models combine creative destruction with such “own innovation” by existing firms on their own products — see
chapter 12 in Aghion and Howitt (2009) and chapter 14 in Acemoglu (2011). A
recent example is Akcigit and Kerr (2018).
Still other theories emphasize the contribution of brand new varieties. Romer
(1990) is the classic reference. Acemoglu (2003) and Jones (2016) are some of
the many follow-ups. Studies such as Howitt (1999) and Young (1998) combine
variety growth with quality growth. Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein
(2006) estimate the importance of variety growth for U.S. imports.
How much each channel contributes to growth matters for innovation policy. Knowledge externalities are a force pushing up the social return to research
relative to its private return in all of these models. But business stealing, a
powerful force in creative destruction models, boosts the private return relative
to the social return. Atkeson and Burstein (2018) analyze the welfare effects of
increasing research in a model with own innovation, creative destruction, and
new varieties. The more growth involves business stealing (creative destruction), the smaller the welfare gains they find. Thus, to determine the welfare
effects of innovation policy, it is important to know the extent to which growth

HOW DESTRUCTIVE IS INNOVATION?

comes from creative destruction (which entails a lot of business stealing) as
opposed to own innovation and new variety creation (which do not).
Ideally, one could directly observe the extent to which new products substitute for existing products. Broda and Weinstein (2010) and Hottman, Redding
and Weinstein (2016) are important efforts along these lines for nondurable
consumer goods. Such high quality scanner data has not been analyzed in the
same way for consumer durables, producer intermediates, or producer capital
goods — all of which figure prominently in theories of growth.1
Likewise, when a new product replaces an existing product, one would like
to identify whether the new product is owned by another firm (“creative destruction”) or the same firm (“own innovation”). Based on case studies, Christensen (1997) argues that innovation largely takes the form of creative destruction, and almost always from new firms. Akcigit and Kerr (2018) look at whether
patents cite earlier patents by the same firm or by other firms. The case studies and the sample of patenting firms, however, may not be representative of
firms in the broader economy. Many innovative firms, particularly outside of
manufacturing, do not patent.
In the absence of more direct evidence, we try to infer the sources of growth
indirectly from the patterns of job creation and job destruction among all private sector firms in the U.S. nonfarm economy. We use data from the U.S.
Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) from 1983 to 2013. The seminal work
of Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) documents the magnitude of job flows
within U.S. manufacturing, and these flows are commonly used as proxies for
the intensity of creative destruction. For example, Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin
and Miranda (2014) point to the decline in U.S. job reallocation since the 1970s
as evidence of a decline in the rate of creative destruction.
We view the LBD data through the lens of an exogenous growth model featuring creative destruction, own innovation, and new varieties. For industries
1

Gordon (2007) and Greenwood, Hercowitz and Krusell (1997) emphasize the importance of
growth embodied in durable goods based on the declining relative price of durables.

4

GARCIA-MACIA, HSIEH, KLENOW

such as manufacturing, the object of innovation may be products. For services
and retail, which make up the bulk of the LBD data, innovation may take the
form of new and improved establishments. For example, Walmart opening a
new store may be akin to adding a new product. A new Walmart store arguably
gains market share by offering a distinct variety (the store format, including all
the items for sale within it) and/or by offering low prices (due to high process
efficiency) relative to existing stores in the local market.
We reach four conclusions from our indirect inference based on LBD data.
First, most growth appears to come from incumbents rather than entrants. This
is because the employment share of entrants is modest. Second, most growth
seems to occur through quality improvements rather than brand new varieties.
Third, own-variety improvements by incumbents loom larger than creative destruction (by entrants and incumbents). The contribution of creative destruction is around 25 percent of growth, with the remainder mostly due to own innovation by incumbent firms. Fourth, the contribution of entrants and creative
destruction declined from 1983–1993 to 2003–2013, while the contribution of
incumbent firms, particularly through own innovation, increased.
Influential papers by Baily, Hulten and Campbell (1992) and Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (2001) likewise use firm-level data to document the contributions of entry, exit, reallocation, and within-plant productivity growth to
overall growth in the manufacturing sector. They use accounting frameworks
without any model assumptions. In contrast, we analyze the data through the
lens of a specific model of growth. Like us, Lentz and Mortensen (2008) and
Acemoglu, Akcigit, Bloom and Kerr (2017) conduct indirect inference on growth
models using firm-level data (from Denmark and the U.S., respectively). They
assume the only source of growth is creative destruction, whereas our goal is
to infer how much growth comes from creative destruction vs. other sources
of innovation (own-variety improvements by incumbents and creation of new
varieties). Their results are for manufacturing, whereas ours are for the entire
nonfarm business sector.

HOW DESTRUCTIVE IS INNOVATION?

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out the parsimonious exogenous growth model we use. Section 3 presents the data moments
from the LBD that we exploit to infer the sources of innovation. Section 4 presents
the model parameter values which best match the moments from the LBD data.
Section 5 reports how our results change under alternative measures of job flows.
Section 6 concludes.

Models of Innovation

This section lays out a model in which growth occurs through a combination
of creative destruction, own innovation, and new varieties. Although all three
types of innovation can contribute to aggregate growth, the goal is to illustrate
how they might leave different telltale signs in the micro-data.

Static Equilibrium
Aggregate output is a CES combination of quality-weighted varieties:
"
Y =

(qj yj )

,

j=1

where yj denotes the quantity and qj the quality of variety j. Labor is the only
factor of production. Output of variety j is given by yj = lj , where lj is labor
used to produce variety j. As in Klette and Kortum (2004), a firm may produce
multiple varieties. We assume an overhead cost of production that must be
expended before choosing prices and output. The overhead cost allows the
highest quality producer to charge the monopoly markup

σ
,
σ−1

as the next low-

est quality competitor will be deterred by zero ex post profits under Bertrand
competition. Without this assumption, firms would engage in limit pricing and
markups would be heterogeneous across varieties as in Peters (2016). With
common markups there is no misallocation of labor across varieties.

6

Firms face a common wage in a competitive labor market, so the profit maximizing quantity of labor employed in producing variety j is:

lj =

L W 1−σ qjσ−1 .

Here W is the real wage and L is aggregate employment.2 Employment of a firm

where Mf denotes the number of varieties produced by firm f . As shown, firm

employment is proportional to
qj . Larger firms control more varieties and
j=1

produce higher quality products. In the special case of σ = 1 analyzed by Klette
and Kortum (2004), an equal amount of labor is used to produce each variety
and a firm’s employment is proportional to the number of varieties it controls.
We will find it important to allow σ > 1 so that firms can be larger when they
have higher quality products rather than just a wider array of products.
After imposing the labor market clearing condition, the real wage is proportional to aggregate labor productivity:

To the right of the equality, the first term captures the benefit of having more
varieties, and the second term is the power mean of quality across varieties.

We normalize the price of aggregate output to 1.

Innovation
Aggregate growth in the model comes from the creation of new varieties and
from quality improvements on existing varieties. In Klette and Kortum (2004),
the number of varieties is constant and quality growth only occurs when a firm
innovates upon and takes over a variety owned by another firm (“creative destruction”). We allow quality growth to also come from innovation by firms on
the products they own (“own innovation”). Lastly, we allow growth to come from
the creation of brand new varieties.
We make the following assumptions about innovation. First, we assume a
constant exogenous arrival rate for each type of innovation. Second, we assume
that arrivals are in proportion to the number of products owned by a firm. For
example, a firm with two products is twice as likely to creatively destroy another
firm’s variety compared to a firm with one product. Third, in the case of an
existing product, we assume that innovation builds on the existing quality level
of the product.3
The quality drawn by an innovation follows a Pareto distribution with shape
parameter θ and a scale parameter equal to the existing quality level. Thus the
proportional step size of innovation on a given variety, qe, follows a Pareto distribution with shape parameter θ and scale parameter 1. The average proportional
improvement in quality on an existing variety, conditional on innovation and
weighted by employment, is thus

sq =

θ
θ − (σ − 1)

1/(σ−1)

More precisely, sq ≡ (E qeσ−1 )

1/(σ−1)
> 1.

.

Finally, we assume that entrants have one product, which they obtain by
improving upon an existing variety or by creating a brand new variety.
3

If innovation was endogenous, there would be a positive externality to research unless all
research was done by firms on their own products. Such knowledge externalities are routinely
assumed in the quality ladder literature, such as Grossman and Helpman (1991), Aghion and
Howitt (1992), Kortum (1997), and Acemoglu, Akcigit, Bloom and Kerr (2017).

GARCIA-MACIA, HSIEH, KLENOW

The notation for innovation probabilities is given in Table 1. Time is discrete
and innovation rates are per existing variety. The arrival rate of each type of
innovation increases linearly with the number of varieties owned by the firm.
The probability an existing variety is improved upon by the firm that currently
owns the product is λi . If a firm fails to improve on a variety it produces, then
that variety is vulnerable to creative destruction by other firms. Conditional
on not being improved by the incumbent, δi is the probability the product is
improved by another incumbent. Conditional on not being improved by any
incumbent, δe is the probability the product will be improved by an entrant.
In short, a given product can be improved upon by the current owner of the
product, another incumbent firm, or an entrant. The probability a product will
be improved upon by the owner is λi . The unconditional probability of innovation by another incumbent is δei ≡ δi (1 − λi ). The unconditional probability
the product will be improved by an entrant is δee ≡ δe (1 − δi )(1 − λi ).4 The
probability an existing product is improved upon by any firm is thus λi + δei + δee .
And conditional on innovation, the average improvement in quality is sq > 1.
Brand new varieties arrive at rate κe from entrants and at rate κi from incumbents. These arrival rates are per existing variety and independent of other
innovation types. The quality of each new variety is drawn from the quality
distribution of existing products multiplied by sκ , which can be greater or less
than 1.
The last parameter we introduce is overhead labor, which pins down the
minimum firm size. We set overhead labor so that the smallest firm has 1 unit
of labor for production. The overhead cost determines the cutoff quality — varieties below the threshold have negative present discounted value (even taking
into account the arrival of innovations associated with owning a variety), and
therefore exit endogenously. The cutoff rises endogenously with wage growth,
and ψ denotes the average quality of varieties (relative to the mean quality of all
existing varieties) that exit due to the overhead cost. The overhead cost ensures

The ordering of conditional/unconditional probabilities is inconsequential scorekeeping.

The contribution of new varieties is given by sκ (κe + κi ), which is increasing in
the arrival rates κe and κi and in the quality of new varieties as determined by
sκ . The contribution of own innovation is the product of the probability of own
innovation λi and the quality improvements sq σ−1 associated with them. The
contribution of creative destruction is the product of the probability of creative
destruction δee + δei and the corresponding quality increases. Finally, the loss
from the exit of low quality varieties due to overhead costs is captured by δo ψ,
the product of the frequency and quality of varieties lost.

arrival rates are multiplied by their corresponding step sizes (sκ in the case of
new varieties and sσ−1
for own innovation and creative destruction).
q
In sum, the innovation probabilities (κi , κe , λi , δi , and δe ) along with the quality steps (θ and sκ ) pin down the share of growth driven by own innovation,
creative destruction, and new varieties. These parameters also determine the
share of growth driven by incumbents vs. entrants. We will estimate these
parameters from the patterns in the LBD micro data. Once we estimate them,
we can decompose growth into the three types of innovation as well as the
contribution of incumbents vs. entrants.

Firm Dynamics
Firm employment is the outcome of all three types of innovation. A firm’s employment is proportional to the number of products the firm produces and the
average quality of those products. A firm that is successful in innovating, either
by improving the quality of one of its own products, improving the quality of
a product made by another firm, or coming up with a brand new variety, will
grow in employment. A firm whose products are taken over by another firm, or
even fails to innovate, will shrink in employment. A firm will exit when all of its
products are creatively destroyed and/or cannot justify their overhead costs.
To convey how we will try to identify the sources of growth, we now highlight
the predictions of three polar models, each with only one source of growth.

HOW DESTRUCTIVE IS INNOVATION?

11

Creative Destruction
Consider a polar model where the only source of innovation is creative destruction.5 Furthermore, assume σ = 1 so quality has no effect on firm employment.
This is simply the Klette and Kortum (2004) model. In this polar model, incumbent firms grow when they take over another firm’s product and shrink when
another firm (an entrant or incumbent) innovates on their products. The rate
of job destruction is tied to the rates of creative destruction by incumbent firms
δi and entrants δe . The other side of job destruction is job creation, which can
come from entrants or from incumbents. The rate of creative destruction by incumbents δi determines the job creation rate by incumbents, and the unconditional rate of innovation by entrants (1 − δi )δe pins down the job creation rate by
entrants. The two parameters δe and δi collectively determine the aggregate rate
of job creation and job destruction. This polar model has specific predictions
for the distribution of job creation and job destruction across firms. See the
bars labeled σ=1 in Figure 1. Following Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996),
the percent change in firm employment on the horizontal axis is measured as
the change in firm employment between time t and t + 1 divided by the average
of the firm’s employment at time t and t+1. The rates are thus bounded between
-2 (exit) and +2 (entry). The density on the vertical axis is the percent of all job
creation or destruction contributed by firms in each bin of employment growth.
For visual clarity, the figure omits firm exit (-2) and firm entry (+2).
As can be seen, the distribution of job creation and job destruction in this
polar model is concentrated at a small number of discrete bins of employment
growth. Product quality has no effect on firm employment in this polar model
because σ =1, so firm employment is only a function of the number of varieties
the firm produces. The distribution of job creation and job destruction is simply
the change in the number of varieties across firms. Figure 1 shows that most
5

Here we assume κi = κe = λi = 0. We use the 1983–1993 data to fix the other parameter
values: the Pareto shape parameter for quality draws, θ, to match TFP growth; δe to match the
entrant share of employment; and δi to match the rate of job destruction.

Figure 1: Job Creation and Destruction with only Creative Destruction

Note: The figure is based on simulating a model with only creative destruction as a source
of growth. Employment growth for a firm is defined as the change in employment divided
by average employment at the firm at the beginning and end of each period. The vertical
axis gives the share of total job creation (destruction) associated with firms at each given
level of employment growth. Entry (+2) and exit (-2) are omitted in the figure. σ is the
elasticity of substitution across varieties.

expanding firms double their number of varieties (the bin with employment
growth = 0.67). Conditional on shrinking, the majority of shrinking firms lose
half of their varieties (the bin with employment growth = –0.67). The density
of small changes in job creation and destruction depends on the fraction of
firms with multiple products that either gain or lose a small number of these
products. For example, the bin with employment growth = –0.4 are firms that
lose a third of their products.
The model has implications for two additional moments in the data. First,
growth in firm employment by age is driven by the accumulation of varieties.
Life cycle growth is therefore determined by the rate at which incumbent firms
improve upon the varieties of other firms, δi . Second, the model predicts that
firm exit rates will fall sharply with firm size. To see this, note that a firm with
n varieties exits when other firms innovate upon and take over all n of its varieties. The probability that a firm with n varieties exits is thus given by the exit

Note: The figure is based on simulating a model with only creative destruction as a
source of growth. The exit rate is annualized from a model with 5-year periods. σ is

probability of a one-variety firm to the power of n. Since the employment of a
firm is proportional to the number of varieties it produces, the model predicts
that an n-fold difference in firm employment will be associated with a change
in the exit rate to the power of n. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between
firm exit and firm employment predicted by this polar model.
To get quality to matter for firm employment, we need to drop the assumption that σ =1. Figure 2 shows that raising σ from 1 to 4 flattens the exit-size
slope. This change also makes the distribution of job creation and job destruction more continuous, as shown in Figure 1. Employment growth rates are now
a function of the change in average quality as well as the change in the number
of varieties. In addition, changing σ to 4 makes the tails of the distribution
of employment growth thicker. Firms will experience large increases in employment when they grab a high quality variety from another firm, and sharp
drops in employment when they lose their high quality varieties. An empirical
challenge for this creative-destruction-only model, even with σ > 1, will be
generating small increases in employment at many firms.

14

GARCIA-MACIA, HSIEH, KLENOW

Own Innovation
We next consider a model where the only source of growth is own innovation.6
This polar model has its own stark properties. The share of entrants is zero
because there are neither new varieties nor creative destruction from entrants.
The exit rate is zero because there is no creative destruction. Figure 3 plots the
distribution of job creation and destruction. Firms grow only when they innovate on their products. The distribution of job creation is only a function of the
heterogeneity across firms in quality improvements.7 Firms that do not improve
on their products (at all or enough) shrink due to the general equilibrium effect
of a rising real wage, and this is the only force that generates job destruction
in the model. This effect can be seen in the spike of employment declines by
25 percent. If all firms innovated, then this spike would not be present. The
model predicts that no firms experience an employment decline in excess of 25
percent. Those firms who innovate but draw small steps shrink more modestly.

Own Innovation + Creative Destruction by Entrants
The extreme empirical predictions of a model with only own innovation follow
from the absence of creative destruction. Thus, consider a hybrid model in
which incumbents improve the quality of their own products and entrants engage in creative destruction.8 This hybrid model has the following implications.
First, the employment share of entrants is positive and pinned down by the rate
of creative destruction by entrants δe . Second, the tail of job creation is thin
because there is no creative destruction by incumbent firms. The tail of job
destruction is thin because job destruction is pinned down by the employment
6

We assume κi = κe = δi = δe = 0 and no overhead costs. We set the parameter θ to match
1983–1993 TFP growth and λi to the value of δi in the creative-destruction only model.
7
This model does not have a stationary quality or employment distribution across firms. But
the distribution of job creation and destruction is stationary, as it only depends on the Pareto
distribution of quality improvements (steps sq ).
8
We keep the same parameters as in the own-innovation model and we use the same δe as in
the model with only creative destruction.

HOW DESTRUCTIVE IS INNOVATION?

Figure 3: Job Creation and Destruction with Own Innovation

Note: The figure is based on simulating a model with only incumbent improvement
of their own products (own innovation). Employment growth for a firm is defined
as the change in employment divided by average employment at the firm at the
beginning and end of each period. The vertical axis gives the share of total job
creation (destruction) associated with firms at each given level of employment
growth. We used σ = 4 for the elasticity of substitution between varieties.

share of entrants. Third, entrants are slightly larger than incumbents on average. This is because all entrants improve on incumbent quality, whereas only a
subset of surviving incumbents improve their quality. Finally, since incumbent
firms can only innovate by improving their one product, larger firms are larger
only because of higher quality, not because they produce more varieties. As a
result, the probability that a firm exits is the same regardless of its size.
If the data is inconsistent with the predictions of this hybrid model, then it
might help to add creative destruction from incumbents. Creative destruction
from incumbent firms will thicken the tails of job creation and destruction. It
will also generate heterogeneity in the number of varieties across firms. Older
firms will tend to have more varieties than young firms. This implies that average employment will tend to be higher in older firms relative to young firms.
Larger firms will also tend to exit less than small firms do, because larger firms
will have more varieties on average.

16

GARCIA-MACIA, HSIEH, KLENOW

More creative destruction will thicken the tail of job destruction. But the
frequency of small employment declines depends on the fraction of varieties
that do not improve or that innovate but draw small steps. Employment falls in
such firms due to the general equilibrium effect of a rising real wage.

New Varieties
We now consider the effect of allowing firms to create new varieties. A model
where firms only create new varieties has stark predictions that are not likely
to hold empirically. As in the model where growth is only driven by own innovation, there is no exit and the only source of job destruction is the general
equilibrium effect of a rising real wage on firms that do not create new varieties.9
So new varieties will need to be combined with other sources of innovation.
How might we infer new variety creation (κe + κi ) from the data moments we
have? Constant arrival rates per variety turn out to imply a constant steady state
ratio of total varieties to the total number of firms. The total number of firms is
by definition the product of average employment per firm and total employment. As we will see later, average firm size is fairly stable in the data so we will
infer growth in the number of varieties from the growth of total employment.
How do we know whether new varieties come from entrants or incumbents
(κe vs. κi )? Total innovation from entrants will be disciplined by the employment
share of entrants. If new varieties come from incumbents, this will be a source
of life cycle employment growth (i.e., firm size increasing with age).
Finally, how will we infer how good new varieties are? Suppose new varieties
are of lower quality than existing qualities (i.e., sκ < 1). This will be a force
increasing the dispersion of quality and firm size. If entrants make them, this
will tend to make young firms smaller than old firms. If incumbents create these
low quality new varieties, that will increase the mass of job creation at lower
values of employment growth.
9

This is assuming no overhead cost.

Recap on Innovation and Job Flows
We will use data on job flows to speak to the sources of innovation. Motivated
by the preceding discussion of how to discriminate between sources, we will

U.S. Longitudinal Business Database

We use firm-level data on employment from the U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The LBD is based on administrative employment records
of every nonfarm private establishment in the U.S. economy. The advantages of
the LBD are its broad coverage and its quality (e.g., the Census uses it to identify
and correct for measurement error in its quinquennial Census surveys).
10

In fitting the job creation and destruction rates we also fit employment growth.
Recall that firm employment growth rate is defined as the ratio of the change in employment
to the average of initial and final employment. A growth rate of 1 is therefore a three-fold
increase in employment relative to initial employment.
11

GARCIA-MACIA, HSIEH, KLENOW

The establishment-level variables we use are employment, industry (4-digit
SIC or 6-digit NAICS), the year the establishment appears in the LBD for the
first time, the establishment’s ID, and the ID of the firm that owns the establishment. We use the year the establishment appears in the LBD to impute the
establishment’s age (the LBD does not provide the establishment’s age directly).
We restrict the sample to 1983–2013 and drop establishments in the public,
educational, agricultural, and mining sectors.
We focus on firms rather than establishments because business stealing has
clear implications for innovation policy (Atkeson and Burstein, 2018). In our
baseline sample, we aggregate the data of establishments within a firm. Firm
employment is the sum of employment at the establishments owned by a firm.
Firm age is the age of the oldest establishment owned by the firm. An “entrant”
is a firm for which the oldest establishment was created within the last five years
(inclusive). An “incumbent” is a firm for which the oldest establishment was
created five or more years earlier. A firm “exits” when it loses all its establishments in the next five years. We calculate 5-year moments because various adjustment costs might suppress an entrant’s market share relative to the quality
of its products.12
Our firm employment dynamics include the direct positive and negative effects of mergers and acquisitions. Such M&A activity can be the result of the
innovation forces we model in this paper. A firm may acquire another firm
or establishment to implement an improvement on the target firm’s products.
Still, to check the robustness of our estimates, we also use an alternative sample
where we drop establishments that undergo ownership changes, and calculate
job creation and destruction rates based on this sample.
Table 2 presents some summary statistics for our LBD sample. Total employment and the number of firms increased from 1983 to 2013, but average
employment per firm and the dispersion of firm size were fairly stable. The
growth rate of aggregate employment was much slower from 2003–2013 than
12

Haltiwanger et al. (2013) show that plants in the LBD grow faster than average until age five.

from 1983–1993. Since average employment per firm was roughly constant, the
growth rate of the number of firms also fell.
The last column in Table 2 shows the annual TFP growth rate in each ten
year period: 1.66% from 1983 to 1993, 2.30% from 1993 to 2003, and 1.32% in the
2003–2013 period. So 1993-2003 was the high growth period and 2003–2013 the
low growth period. These estimates are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
and cover the nonfarm business sector, like the LBD.
Next, Figure 4 presents the overall rates of job creation and destruction, calculated over five years. We remove net job creation at the industry level (either
4-digit SIC or 6-digit NAICS) so the job flows in Figure 4 are mostly within industries. If we do not net out employment changes at the industry level, the aggregate job creation and destruction rates are about 1.3 percentage points higher.
The job creation rate labeled ‘1983–1993’ is the average of the job creation rate
from 1983–1988 and 1988–1993. The job creation (destruction) rate is the sum
of employment changes at firms with (rising) falling employment divided by
the average of aggregate employment in the initial and final year of each period.
This includes entering and exiting firms. The job creation and destruction rates
labeled ‘1993–2003’ and ‘2003–2013’ are defined analogously.

Figure 4: Job Creation and Destruction Rates

Note: The job creation (destruction) rate is the sum of employment changes at firms
with rising (falling) employment divided by the average of aggregate employment in
the initial and final year of each 5-year period. This includes entering and exiting
firms. The figure shows the average 5-year changes for 1983–1988 and 1988–1993,
1993–1998 and 1998–2003, and 2003–2008 and 2008–2013. Statistics computed
from U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) on firms in the nonfarm
business sector.

The job creation rate fell by 12 percentage points from 1983–1993 to 2003–
2013, while the job destruction rate fell by only 2 percentage points. This is
consistent with the decline in aggregate employment growth from 1983–1993
and 2003–2013 shown in Table 2. Since we control for net employment changes
at the industry level, the decline in job creation is driven by the change in job
flows across firms in the same industry. Most of the decline in the aggregate
job reallocation rate highlighted by Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda
(2014) was due to the decline in the job creation rate. The decline in the job
destruction rate was much smaller.
Aggregate job creation is the sum of job creation by incumbent firms and
job creation by entering firms. Figure 5 presents the job creation rate due to
entrants — the employment share of firms that did not exist five years earlier.
The employment share of entrants labeled ‘1983–1993’ is the average of employment of entrants in 1988 as a share of total employment in 1988 and employment of entrants in 1993 as a share of total employment in 1993. Similarly, the

Figure 5: Employment Share of Entrants

Note: The employment share of entrants for 1983–1993 is the average share of
entrant employment in 1988 and 1993. Entrant employment in 1988 (1993) is
employment of firms that entered between 1983 and 1988 (1988 and 1993), and the
share is relative to aggregate employment in 1988 (1993). The entrant employment
shares for 1993–2003 and 2003–2013 are defined analogously. Statistics computed
from U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) on firms in the nonfarm
business sector.

label ‘1993-2003’ (‘2003–2013’) refers to the average of the employment share of
entrants in 1998 and 2003 (2008 and 2013).
The employment share of entrants fell by 8 percentage points between 1983–
1993 and 2003–2013, as displayed in Figure 5. The aggregate job creation rate,
shown previously in Figure 4, declined by 12 percentage points. So about twothirds of the decline in the aggregate job creation rate was due to the decline in
the employment share of entrants.
Figure 6 plots the distribution of job creation and destruction in the LBD.
We plot averages from 1983–1988 and 1988–1993 (labeled as ‘1983–1993’) and
averages from 2003–2008 and 2008–2013 (labeled as ‘2003–2013’). The growth of
firm employment on the x-axis is measured as the change in firm employment
divided by the average of the firm’s employment in the initial and final years.
These rates are bounded between -2 (exit) and +2 (entry). The vertical axis
shows the percent of all creation or destruction contributed by firms in each
bin. These definitions follow Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996).

Figure 6: Distribution of Job Creation and Destruction

Note: Employment growth for a firm is defined as the change in firm employment
over (say) 1988 to 1993 divided by the firm’s average employment in 1988 and 1993.
The vertical axis gives the share of total job creation (destruction) associated with
firms at each given level of employment growth. 1983–1993 refers to averaging these
job creation and destruction rates in the two periods. 2003–2013 entries are defined
analogously. Entry (+2) and exit (-2) are omitted in the figure. Statistics computed
from U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) on firms in the nonfarm
business sector.

The empirical distribution of job creation and destruction in Figure 6 looks
very different from the distribution in the models with only creative destruction
(Figure 1) or own innovation (Figure 3). There is much more mass on smaller
changes in employment in the data compared to the polar model with only
creative destruction. And there is far greater mass in the tail of job destruction
in the data than in a model of incremental growth through own innovation. The
empirical moment we use from Figure 6 is the share of job creation at firms
where employment increases by less than a factor of 3. This number, shown
in Figure 7, is 32% in 1983–1993 and 36% in both 1993–2003 and 2003–2013.
The share of job destruction at firms where employment declines by less than a
factor of 3 averages 23% over the thirty years of our data.
We next present average employment of entrants and incumbents in 1988,
1998, and 2008 (Figure 8). According to Hsieh and Klenow (2014), rapid growth
of surviving plants is a robust phenomenon in the U.S. Census of Manufactur-

factor of 3. Statistics computed from U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database

Figure 9: Exit Rate, Large vs. Small Firms

Note: The exit rate is the annualized fraction of firms that operated in (say) 1983 but
not in 1988. The data for 1983–1993 are averages of the exit rates from 1983 to 1988
and 1988 to 1993. The 1993-2003 and 2003–2013 exit rates are defined analogously.
Exit rates computed from U.S. Census Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) on

ing. Figure 8 suggests that the same is true for the entire U.S. private sector.
The model can explain this fact if older firms have more and better products
compared to young firms.
Figure 9 shows the exit rate of large vs. small firms, where large is defined as
above-mean employment and small as below-mean employment. Here the exit
rate is the annualized probability the firm exits within the next five years. The label ‘1983–1993’ refers to the average of the annualized exit rates from 1983–1988
and 1988–1993. The labels ‘1993-2003’ and ‘2003–2013’ are the corresponding
average of the exit rates from 1993–1998 and 1998–2003 and from 2003–2008
and 2008–2013. Note that smaller firms have higher exit rates than larger firms.
The model can explain this fact if larger firms produce more varieties compared
to smaller firms. However, in contrast to the prediction of the polar model with
only creative destruction, the decline in exit rates with firm size is gradual. The
average size of large firms is about 16 times that of small firms. In the polar
model with only creative destruction, the exit rate of large firms should then

HOW DESTRUCTIVE IS INNOVATION?

25

equal that of small firms to the 16th power, or essentially zero. In the data, the
exit rate of large firms (around 6%) is about 2 percentage points lower than the
exit rate of small firms (about 8%).

Sources of Growth

We now estimate parameters to match moments from model simulations to the
corresponding moments in the U.S. LBD. We define a period in the model as
five years. We need to estimate 5 innovation rates (δi , δe , λi , κi , and κe ), 2 quality
step-size parameters (θ and sκ ), and the overhead cost. So 8 parameters. In our
base case we target the aggregate rate of TFP growth, minimum employment
per firm of 1, the cross-sectional standard deviation of log firm employment, the
aggregate rates of job creation and destruction (the difference is the growth rate
of employment), the employment share of entrants, the share of job creation <
1, average employment for old relative to young firms, and exit rates for both
small and large firms. So 10 moments.13
We choose the overhead cost so that the smallest firm has a single production worker. The overhead cost pins down the endogenous rate at which existing varieties disappear due to obsolescence δo and their average quality ψ.
Conditional on the overhead cost, we make sure the combination of δi , δe , λi ,
κi , κe , θ, and sκ are such that expected TFP growth in the model exactly equals
average TFP growth in the data. We choose the individual parameters to best fit
the remaining data moments.
Appendix A provides more detail on the simulated method of moments we
deploy. In short, we choose parameter values to minimize the mean squared
percent distance between the simulated and empirical moments for the 8 moments other than aggregate TFP growth and minimum firm size. We weight
moments equally because, given the large number of firms in the LBD, sampling
error is a minor consideration for all of the moments.
13

We also choose the level of employment in the model to fit employment per firm in the data.

Table 3 presents the 8 parameter values inferred from the data using the procedure described above.14 Based on the data moments from 1983 to 1993, we infer a 69% arrival rate of own-variety quality improvements per five-year period.
Conditional on no own-innovation, quality improvements through creative destruction occur 30% of the time by other incumbents. Conditional on no owninnovation and creative destruction by another incumbent, quality improvement through creative destruction by entrants occurs with probability one. The
unconditional probability that a given product improves due to creative destruction by an incumbent is thus 9.4%, and the unconditional probability of
creative destruction by an entrant is 21.5%.15 The unconditional probability
that a product is improved upon in a five-year period is thus 100%, of which
69% is from own innovation and 31% is from creative destruction (the latter
from entrants or incumbents).

The employment-weighted average step size for quality improvements on
1/(σ−1)

θ
existing varieties is given by sq = θ−(σ−1)
. Given that θ = 15.3 and σ =4,
the average improvement in quality (conditional on innovation) is 7.5%. New
varieties are only created by entrants, arrive with 11.8% probability per existing
variety, and have an average quality that is 31% of the average quality of existing
varieties. Overhead costs imply that the average quality of exiting products ψ is
3% of the average quality of existing varieties, and that the probability a variety
exits due to overhead cost δo is essentially zero. The net number of varieties thus
grows by 11.8% every five years, which matches the growth of total employment
and number of firms from 1983–1993.
Table 4 presents TFP growth due to creative destruction (row 1), new varieties (row 2), and own innovation (row 3). TFP growth due to each source of
innovation is the product of arrival rate of innovation and the quality improvement conditional on innovation. We use equation (1) for this calculation.16 The
first column shows that TFP growth due to own innovation was about 1% per
year in 1983-1993. Growth due to creative destruction was about half that, at
0.46% per year. And new varieties generates growth of 0.22% per year.
The rows in Table 5 show the contribution of each source of innovation to
aggregate TFP growth. About 28% of the 1.66% growth rate in the 1983-1993
period comes from creative destruction. Own-variety improvements by incumbents account for 59%. New varieties a la Romer (1990) are the remainder at
around 13%.
The columns in Table 5 also decompose aggregate TFP growth into the percentage contribution of entrants vs. incumbents using equation (2). In the ten
years between 1983 and 1993, incumbents account for 68% of aggregate TFP
growth, with entrants contributing the remaining 32%. Aghion et al. (2014)
provide complementary evidence for the importance of incumbents based on
their share of R&D spending and patents.
16

Equation (1) is nonlinear so there is no unique decomposition. For the Table we calculate
growth from each source in isolation. The contributions are very similar if we instead subtract
each source individually from overall growth.

Note: Table presents the product of the arrival rate of each source of innovation
and the average improvement in quality (conditional on innovation) implied by
the innovation parameters in Table 3.

Table 3 shows that the arrival rate of new varieties κe fell from 11.8% in 1983–
1993 to 9.5% in 1993–2003. We infer this because of the employment growth
rate fell from 2.4% in 1983–1993 to 1.6% in 1993–2003. Since average firm size
— and thus varieties per firm — was roughly constant, we infer from the drop in
employment growth that the growth rate in the total number of varieties must
also have fallen. So TFP growth from new variety creation fell modestly from
0.22% per year in 1983–1993 to 0.20% per year in 1993–2003.
The share of job creation < 1 also increased to 37% in the high growth period
(from 32% in 1983–1993). The increase in the importance of small changes in
employment implies that the arrival rate of own variety improvement increased
relative to the rate of creative destruction. Remember that own variety innovation only results in small changes in employment, whereas creative destruction generates large changes in employment. Comparing the 1983–1993 to the
1993–2003 period, the own innovation rate increased modestly from 69% to 71%
(Table 3). TFP growth from own innovation rose from 1% to almost 1.5% per
year (Table 4). Aggregate TFP growth (from all three sources of innovation)
increased by 0.64 percentage points from 1983–1993 to 1993–2003 (Table 2).
Therefore, own innovation was responsible for almost 80% of the increase in
aggregate TFP growth, and the remaining 20% due to more innovation from
creative destruction.

GARCIA-MACIA, HSIEH, KLENOW

Turning to the 2003–2013 period, the main fact is the eight percentage point
decline in the employment share of entrants between 1983–1993 and 2003–2013
seen in Figure 5. The model interprets the decline as reflecting less innovation
by entrants. How much is less new variety creation vs. creative destruction
by entrants? New variety creation is pinned down by the growth rate of employment, which fell to 0.5% in 2003–2013. The implied arrival rate of new
varieties thus fell to 3.6%. The residual entrant employment due to new varieties
is creative destruction by entrants. Table 3 indicates that the unconditional
probability of creative destruction by an entrant fell from 21.5% in 1983–1993
to 16.4% by 2003–2013. The net effect is that TFP growth from innovation by
creation of new varieties by entrants fell to 0.05% per year in 2003–2013, down
from 0.22% in the 1983–1993 period.
Job creation by incumbents also fell by 4 percentage points between 1983–
1993 and 2003–2013, which the model interprets as a decline in the arrival rate
of creative destruction by incumbents. According to Table 3, the probability
a variety is creatively destroyed by an incumbent firm dropped from 9.4% to
6.7%. Table 4 shows that TFP growth from creative destruction falls from 0.46%
in 1983-1993 to 0.3% per year 2003–2013. Since TFP growth from all three types
of innovation fell by 0.34 percentage points over this period (Table 2), the decline in creative destruction accounts for almost all the decline in aggregate TFP
growth.
So the model’s proximate answer to the question “how much the decline in
job creation matters for aggregate TFP growth” is that entrant innovation and
incumbent creative destruction have declined. Still, what the aggregate job
creation rate misses is the contribution of own innovation. Table 4 shows that
growth from own innovation by incumbent firms was roughly the same in 2003–
2013 compared to the 1983–1993 period.
As noted, our estimation procedure chose parameter values such that the
model exactly matched aggregate TFP growth. Table 6 (column 2) shows the
fit of the model in 2003–2013 for the data moments we used for the estimation

but did not force the model to perfectly match.17 The model comes close on
the entrant employment share, the job creation and destruction rates, and the
standard deviation of log employment, but understates the share of job creation
< 1, the exit rate of large vs. small firms, and the average size of incumbent firms
vs. entrants.18
Andrews, Gentzkow and Shapiro (2017) propose a local measure of the relationship between parameter estimates and moments. In this spirit, Table 18 in
Appendix C presents the Jacobian matrix of moments with respect to parameter
values. The Table shows the percentage change in each moment with respect
to a 0.1 level increase in each parameter. The results are based on linear extrapolation of the numerical derivative, evaluated at the 2003–2013 estimated
parameters.
Table 18 conforms well to our intuition. The entrant employment share is
positively related to the pace of creative destruction by entrants (and negatively
related to own innovation, which trims the unconditional probability of creative
destruction by entrants). The job creation rate is inversely related to own innovation, again because it crowds out creative destruction. The job destruction
rate is negatively related to own innovation and new varieties, and positively
related to the pace of creative destruction. The share of job creation < 1 is
increasing in own innovation and new variety creation by incumbents. Size dispersion is increasing in the rate of new variety creation by incumbents because
new varieties are drawn from the entire quality distribution, only with lower
average quality. Own innovation and new variety creation provide protection
against exit. Entrants are smaller if they enter with new varieties, which tend to
be below-average in quality.
The model understates the exit rate and size of large firms because it generates too little heterogeneity in the number of varieties. A higher rate of creative destruction by incumbents would increase the average number of varieties

We also set the minimum firm size near 1, as in the data.

among incumbent firms. This would increase the average size of incumbents
relative to entrants, and would also make the exit rate fall more steeply with firm
size. The rate of creative destruction is constrained, however, by the need to fit
the share of job creation driven by firms with small changes in employment. A
higher rate of creative destruction by incumbents would lower the share of job
creation among firms with small employment growth, which is already too low
in the model relative to the data.
We need to increase the size and number of products of incumbent firms
without increasing the frequency of creative destruction by incumbents. Remember we assume creative destruction by incumbents and entrants is undirected — i.e., uniform across all existing varieties — so the average quality of
a variety improved upon by an incumbent is the same as that of an entrant.
We now relax this assumption. Specifically, we suppose entrants innovate over
lower quality products, where ρe ≤ 1 denotes the average (employment-weighted)
quality of products creatively destroyed by entrants relative to the quality of the
average product.
The third column in Table 6 shows the fit of the model when we introduce
ρe ≤ 1.19 We estimate ρe = 0.57, which lowers the average quality and size of
entrants relative to incumbents. Allowing ρe ≤ 1 also increases the arrival rate of
new varieties by incumbents to 4% from 0% previously. This decreases the exit
rate of large firms, who now have more varieties. Despite having more varieties,
these firms are no larger because their new varieties are of low quality.20 The
share of job destruction due to small changes in employment is 25%, up from
21% in the baseline model. The model with ρe ≤ 1 still under-predicts the share
of small job changes (in the data the share is 36%), but the fit is now better. The
sources of growth do not materially change when we introduce ρe . For example,
innovation by incumbents is responsible for 82% of growth in the model with
ρe ≤ 1, compared to 89% in our baseline model.

We target the same 10 data moments.
The arrival rate (average quality) of new varieties by incumbents is κi = 0.04 (sκ = 0.47).

We did not target the share of large employment changes in job destruction
to arrive at our baseline innovation parameter estimates in Table 3. For 2003–
2013, our model predicts that the share of job destruction < -1 is 80.5%. This
is higher than in the data, which is 72.5%. On this dimension, our baseline
estimates would seem to be overstating the importance of creative destruction.
Finally, creative destruction by incumbents will result in some firms owning
a large number of products. Since we find a limited role for creative destruction,
an implication is that most firms will own only a small number of products.
Table 7 shows that the innovation parameters we estimate imply that about
90% of firms will have a single product, and less than 1% will have more than
3 products. The average number of products per firm, shown in the last row of
Table 7, is around 1.1 to 1.2. We cannot verify this empirically because we do not
know of a dataset which contains the number of products and services sold that
covers all firms in the private sector. Perhaps such data will become available in
the future.

Robustness

We now examine the robustness of our inference exercise. First, we use the
number of establishments as a proxy for the number of products of the firm.
Second, we use alternative measures of job flows to infer the sources of growth.
Third, we measure the sources of innovation in the fast growing information
and communication technology sector.

5.1.

Establishments as Proxies for Products

Ideally, we could directly observe firms discontinuing products due to creative
destruction. The LBD contains no data on products produced, but it does include the number of establishments in a firm. Under this proxy, if creative
destruction is an important reason for job reallocation, then changes in the
number of establishments should have a large effect on aggregate job flows.
For comparison we reproduce our baseline estimates of job flows in the first
column in Table 8. The second column then calculates job flows after dropping
from the sample new and exiting establishments. The job creation rate falls
from 32.5% in the full sample to only 10%. The job destruction rate falls from
30% to about 10%. The share of “small” changes jumps from 36% to 78% of job
creation and from 27.5% to almost 80% of job destruction. Thus the creative
destruction we infer does, indeed, show up largely in plant exit and entry.
We also examine the correlation of job creation and job destruction across
industries. If job reallocation is mostly driven by creative destruction, then
industries should have simultaneously high (or low) rates of job creation and
job destruction. To examine this, we regress the job destruction rate in a 6digit NAICS from 2003 to 2008 on the job creation rate in the same sector. This
regression yields a coefficient of 0.629 (s.e.=0.016, R2 = 0.68).21
21

We obtain similar results in other time periods. For example, for 2008–2013, the coefficient
from regressing the job destruction rate on the job creation rate is 0.583 with a standard error of
0.016 and an R-squared is 0.52.

average number of establishments in the LBD, but the magnitude is very small.
There is no trend in average number of establishments in manufacturing.
The Census of Manufacturing also provides detailed information (at the ten
digit level) on the products made by each establishment. After aggregating this
information to the firm level, Figure 10 plots the average number of products
per firm in manufacturing. It is almost three times larger than the number of
establishments. This suggests caution in using establishments as a proxy for
products in the LBD. Nevertheless, there is no trend in the average number of
products in the manufacturing census.22

5.2.

Alternative Measures of Job Flows

We now look at job flows in alternative samples. First, we have a closed economy model so creative destruction can only come from domestic firms. This is
obviously not true in traded sectors where a domestic firm can innovate on a
product owned by a foreign firm, and vice versa. So we calculate job flows only
in the non-traded service sectors in column 3 of Table 8. Job flows outside of
manufacturing are essentially identical to flows in the full-sample that includes
traded sectors.
Recall that we include mergers and acquisitions in our baseline statistics
on job creation and job destruction. The last two columns in Table 8 check
the effect of dropping those establishments who change ownership. Column 4
entirely drops from the sample establishments that change ownership between
2008 and 2013. Column 5 only omits the direct effect of establishments that
switch ownership; it does add the employment change in such establishments
to the employment change of the acquiring firm. The The resulting job creation
and destruction rates drop by 6 to 7 percentage points. The employment share
of entrants and the share of small employment changes in job creation are about
the same in the new samples.
Another alternative is to use changes in firm output (instead of employment)
to measure innovation. In the model, the change in employment is the same as
the change in output, but this is not true in the data. For example, innovation
may take the form of labor saving technologies. We do not have output data in
the LBD, but we do in the Census of Manufacturing. We therefore calculate the
growth in employment implied by growth in the firm’s value-added.23 The hypothetical job flows with this imputation are shown in the second column of Table
9. For comparison we show the job flows computed from firm employment in
the same manufacturing sample (in column 1). Imputing employment from
firm value-added increases job creation and destruction rates by about 2 per23

We impute employment as the product of the firm’s share of industry’s value-added and
total employment in the industry.

centage points. Intuitively, firm output grows by more than firm employment
among growing firms, and declines by more than employment among shrinking
firms. But note that the share of job creation < 1 is about the same, so adjusting
employment with output data has the same effect on large changes as on small
changes in employment.
Even output may be a biased measure of innovation in the presence of adjustment frictions and changes in the regulation, taxes, or factor costs. The last
column in Table 9 imputes the job flows implied by the change in firm productivity (“TFPQ”) in the Census of Manufacturing.24 Intuitively, these hypothetical
job flows abstract from all other forces behind firm employment other than firm
productivity. The hypothetical job creation rate is roughly twice as large and the
share of job creation from small changes is about 20 percentage points lower.
When using productivity data to impute job flows, we find that a much smaller
share of overall job creation is due to small changes.

of growth. The second column estimates the model using the data moments
from the sample where we drop establishments that undergo ownership changes.
This exercise assumes mergers and acquisitions have no effect on TFP growth.
Since job creation and destruction rates are lower when we drop mergers and
acquisitions (Table 8), we infer a lower rate of creative destruction (and a higher
rate of own innovation).25
The next two columns in Table 10 show the effect of using output and productivity on the sources of growth. To arrive at these numbers, we impute job

25

We include M&A activity in our baseline estimates for two reasons. First, job reallocation
associated with such activity may be a byproduct of innovation. Second, as we find a smaller
role for creative destruction than the existing literature, this is a conservative assumption.

41

flows in the LBD from output and productivity data in manufacturing.26 The
sources of growth implied by the output data (column 3) are about the same
as when we target employment data (column 1). The reason can be seen by
comparing the raw data in columns 1 and 2 in Table 9. The share of small
changes does not change, so the relative importance of creative destruction vs.
own innovation also does not change.
The story is quite different when we target job flows implied by productivity
growth (column 4 in Table 10). Here, creative destruction accounts for almost
50% of growth, and own innovation for only 40%. Creative destruction is more
important now because the share of overall job creation from small changes is
lower. Table 9 shows that the share of job creation < 1 is 20 percentage points
lower when we use productivity growth (column 3) compared to the calculations based on employment data alone (column 1). Because own innovation
generates small changes in employment, we infer a smaller contribution from
own innovation and a larger contribution from creative destruction.
Remember we calculate job flows over five years. We present job flows over
one year in Table 11. An entrant is now defined as a firm created in the last
year (instead of the last five years), and job creation between years t and t + 1 is
now the sum of the employment of entrants in year t + 1 and the employment
change among incumbents with growing employment between these two years.
The job destruction rate over one year is defined analogously.27
26

We make three adjustments to the LBD data to mimic the manufacturing data. First, we
adjust the job creation and destruction rates in the LBD by the difference between the job
flows in column 1 of Table 9 and those in columns 2 and 3 of the same Table. This adjustment
increases the job creation and destruction rates in the LBD by about 2 to 3 percentage points (for
the output adjustment) and 15 percentage points (for the productivity adjustment). Second, we
multiply the share of job creation due to small changes by the ratio of the share of job creation
< 1 calculated from manufacturing employment and the share computed from output and
productivity data. The second adjustment has no effect when we use output data but lowers
the share of small employment changes by almost 50% when we use productivity data. Third,
we adjust size by age and exit by size in the LBD by the ratio of these two statistics in the Census
of Manufacturing computed using employment vs. output (or productivity).
27
Job destruction between t and t + 1 is the sum of employment of firms in year t that exit
by year t + 1 and the change in employment among firms with shrinking employment between
these two years.

The data moments change in two ways. First, firms between the ages of 1
and 5 previously classified as entrants are now incumbents. As a consequence,
the employment share of entrants is lower. Second, job flows are larger. The
annual job creation rate from 2003 to 2013 in Table 11 is 13.1%. The equivalent
number implied by the job creation rate over five years was 6.5%.28 Intuitively,
job creation and destruction now include flows within each five year period.
For example, Table 11 indicates that incumbent firms with age < 5 account
for 16.5% of job creation and 13% of job destruction. Job creation computed
over five years only counted net job creation by incumbents age < 5 (which we
attributed to entrants).
However, remember the distribution of job changes is key for distinguishing
between own innovation and creative destruction. The share of small employment changes in job creation is now higher compared to the share when we
calculate employment changes over five years.29 Our inference exercise will

therefore indicate that the share of growth driven by own innovation vs. creative
destruction will now be even higher. Table 12 shows the share of growth due to
each source of innovation implied by job flows over 1 year. The contribution
of creative destruction to aggregate growth from 2003 to 2013 is now only 11%.
In the same time period, the share of growth from creative destruction inferred
from job flows over 5 years was 23%. The share of growth from own innovation
is, correspondingly, about ten percentage points higher at 83%.
The one-year flows also convey a decline in job creation between 1983–1993
and 2003–2013. The difference now is that the decline is due to the diminishing
employment share of entrants and smaller job flows by young firms (incumbents age < 5).30 When we use job flows over one year to calculate the innovation parameters, creative destruction plays a larger role and own innovation a
smaller role in 1983–1993 than in 2003–2013. So whether we calculate annual or
five-year job flows, own innovation has become more important.
We reiterate that, when innovation can take the form of own innovation,
employment growth of a firm can be a misleading indicator of the firm’s contribution to aggregate growth. Employment will grow by less in a firm that
improves its own product compared to another firm that grows due to creative
30

When we measured job flows over five years, the decline in job creation was entirely due to
the fall in the entrant employment share (firms entering in the last five years).

destruction, even when the innovation step size is the same for the two types
of innovation. Table 13 illustrates this point by showing the contribution of
young vs. old firms to job creation (column 1) versus TFP growth (column 2).
Compare, for example, the contribution of entrants (age < 1) with that of old
firms (age > 15). As noted by many authors, a large share of job creation is due
to entry — entrants account for 31% of all job creation in our calculation.31 Yet
entrants only account for 9% of TFP growth. In contrast, old firms (age > 15) are
responsible for more than 50% of TFP growth, but closer to a third of total job
creation. The reason for this discrepancy is that entrant innovation largely takes
the form of creative destruction while a substantial share of innovation by older
firms takes the form of own innovation. Again, own innovation entails less job
reallocation than when the innovator displaces an existing firm.

31

Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2013) provide similar evidence on the importance of
entrants for job creation.

Innovation in the Information Technology Sector

We end with a case study of the fast growing information and communication
technology (ICT) sector. Table 14 (row 1) shows that TFP growth in the ICT
sector increased from 11.8% in 1983–1993 to 26.4% per year in 1993–2003. The
job creation rate in ICT increased by almost 20 percentage points to 53% and
the job destruction rate increased by 12 percentage points to 39%.32 But the
distribution of job flows also changes. The acceleration of TFP growth in the ICT
sector in 1993–2003 was associated with a decline in the share of job creation <
1 (from 35% to 32%). This fact suggests that the growth acceleration was driven
by an increase in the rate of creative destruction.
Table 15 shows that the contribution of creative destruction to TFP growth
in the ICT sector increased from 17% in 1983–1993 to 36% in 1993–2003. So the
15 percentage point increase in TFP growth growth from 1983–1993 to 1993–
2003 was mostly due to creative destruction. When TFP growth came back
down in 2003-2013 (to “only” 10%), the contribution of creative destruction fell

We revert back to measuring job flows over five years.

back to 16%.33 We caution that this inference is based only on employment
data. Employment growth may understate the extent of productivity growth,
particularly in fast growing sectors like ICT. In addition, our inference exercise
assumes that each ten year period is a steady-state, which may be a particularly
bad approximation for sectors with accelerating then decelerating growth rates
like ICT.

Conclusion

How much innovation takes the form of creative destruction versus new varieties versus firms improving their own products? How much occurs through
entrants versus incumbents? We try to infer the sources of innovation from
the employment dynamics of U.S. firms in the nonfarm private sector from
1983 to 2013. We conclude that creative destruction is vital for understanding
job destruction and accounts for around one-fourth of growth. Own-product
quality improvements by incumbents appear to be the biggest source of growth.
Net variety growth contributes much less than quality improvements do.
33

For fitting the ICT facts in our simulations, we allow the scale parameter of the Pareto
distribution of quality draws to be greater than 1. Without this additional parameter, we can
only fit the extraordinary TFP growth in ICT with a dispersion parameter θ that implies a quality
distribution with infinite variance.

HOW DESTRUCTIVE IS INNOVATION?

47

Our findings are relevant for innovation policy. According to Atkeson and
Burstein (2018), the consumption-equivalent welfare gain from devoting about
1% more of GDP to research every year is between 0.17 and 0.73 percent in a
model calibrated similarly to ours (but with endogenous research investments).
They estimate the gains would be larger — 0.26 to 2.01 percent — if creative
destruction played no role in U.S. growth. Creative destruction is a force raising
the private return relative to the social return to research, diminishing the gains
from promoting research.
Creative destruction ties into political economy theories in which incumbents block entry and hinder growth and development, such as Krusell and
Rios-Rull (1996), Parente and Prescott (2002), and Acemoglu and Robinson (2012).
And creative destruction underscores that some growth brings employment dislocation as a byproduct.
It would be interesting to extend our analysis to individual sectors, other
time periods, and other countries. Retail trade experienced a big-box revolution
in the U.S. led by Walmart’s expansion. Online retailing has made inroads at the
expense of brick-and-mortar stores (Einav, Klenow, Klopack, Levin, Levin and
Best, 2017). In Chinese manufacturing, private enterprises have entered and
expanded while state-owned enterprises have closed (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009).
In India, incumbents do not expand as much as in the U.S. (Hsieh and Klenow,
2014) and therefore contribute less to growth. We analyzed non-manufacturing
separately, and reached similar conclusions. For the ICT sector, we found that
creative destruction played a larger role during its rapid growth phase from
1993–2003.
Our accounting is silent on how the types of innovation interact. In Klette
and Kortum (2004) more entrant creative destruction discourages R&D by incumbents. Alternatively, as stressed by Aghion et al. (2001), a greater threat of
competition from entrants could stimulate incumbents to “escape from competition” by improving their own products. Creative destruction and own innovation could be strategic complements, rather than substitutes.

48

GARCIA-MACIA, HSIEH, KLENOW

Our conclusions are tentative in part because they are model-dependent.
We followed the literature in several ways that might not be innocuous for our
inference. We assumed that spillovers are just as strong for incumbent innovations as for entrant innovations. Young firms might instead generate more
knowledge spillovers than old firms do — Akcigit and Kerr (2018) provide evidence for this hypothesis from patent citations.
We assumed all fluctuations in employment across firms (within industries)
are a byproduct of innovation. By looking within detailed industries, we hoped
to mitigate the influence of non-homothetic preferences and demographic shifts.
We demonstrated robustness to looking at value added and productivity rather
than employment, at least within manufacturing where we could see revenue
and capital. If exit or downsizing occurs for reasons other than innovation, then
our methodology might overstate the contribution of creative destruction.34
We assumed no frictions in employment growth or misallocation of labor
across firms. In reality, the market share of young firms could be suppressed
by adjustment costs, financing frictions, and uncertainty. On top of adjustment
costs for capital and labor, firms may take awhile to build up a customer base,
as in work by Gourio and Rudanko (2014) and Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson
(2016). Irreversibilities could combine with uncertainty about the firm’s quality
to keep young firms small, as in the Jovanovic (1982) model. We defined young
firms as those younger than five years, but these dynamics could play out for
longer. Meanwhile, markups could vary across varieties and firms. All of these
would create a more complicated mapping from firm employment growth to
firm innovation.

Smith, Yagan, Zidar and Zwick (2017) use administrative tax records to document that firm
profits dive after the death of under-65 owner/managers.

Appendix
A

Simulation Algorithm
1. Specify an initial guess for the distribution of quality across varieties.
2. Simulate life paths for a large number of entering firms.
3. Each entrant has one initial variety, captured from an incumbent or newly
created. In every period of its lifetime, it faces a probability of each type of
innovation per variety it owns, as in Table 1. A firm’s life ends when it loses
all of its varieties to other firms or when 40 periods have passed.
4. Based on the population of simulated firms, calculate 10 moments:
(a) TFP growth rate
(b) Standard deviation of log firm employment
(c) Employment share of entrants
(d) Job creation rate
(e) Job destruction rate
(f ) Share of job creation where employment growth ≤ 1
(g) Minimum firm employment
(h) Exit rate for small firms
(i) Exit rate for large firms
(j) Average employment for incumbents relative to entrants
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all moments and the joint distribution of quality
and variety across firms converge. In each iteration, take the quality distribution across varieties from step 4 as the starting point and update the
overhead labor requirement to target minimum employment of 1.

6. Repeat steps 1 to 5, searching for parameter values to (1) exactly match
TFP growth in the data; (2) set minimum firm employment to 1; and (3)
minimize the mean squared percent distance between the simulated and
empirical moments for the remaining statistics in step 4.

Estimates with Standard Errors

We calculate the standard error in the parameters of the model in the following
steps. First, we we draw a thousand samples with replacement of all firm ids in
the LBD data from 1983 to 2013. We then calculate the moments in section 3.
for each sample. This gives us the mean and the variance-covariance matrix of
the 10 data moments, which we denote Σ.
We then calculate the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters V . We
use the SMM formula from Gourieroux and Monfort (1996). This captures both
the variance in data moments and the variance induced by simulation of small
samples:

where J is the Jacobian matrix (in levels), W is the weighting matrix, and Σ
the variance-covariance matrix of the model-simulated moments (for a given
set of parameters). The Jacobian J is estimated as the numerical gradient of the
model-simulated moments with respect to small changes in the parameters.
J is only defined for parameters with an interior solution. Parameters with
corner solutions (δe and κi ) and exactly-identified parameters (θ, δo and ψ) are
assumed to have a standard error of zero. The moment-weighting matrix W is a
diagonal matrix with entries equal to one for all moments except for exit by size

Model Fit and Sensitivity

Table 17 shows the fit of the model for 1983-1993 and 1993-2003. For ease of
comparison, columns 1 and 3 replicate the data for the corresponding ten year
period. And Table 18 presents the Jacobian matrix with local derivatives of the
data moments with respect to our estimated parameter values for 2003-2013.
The Table shows the percentage change in each moments with respect to a 0.1
level increase in each parameter.
