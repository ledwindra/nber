    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding the phenomenon of exclusive dealing, and we explore the motivations for and effects of its use.  For a broad class of models, we characterize the outcome of a contracting game in which manufacturers may employ exclusive dealing provisions in their contracts.  We then apply this characterization to a sequence of specialized settings.  We demonstrate that exclusionary contractual provisions may be irrelevant, anticompetitive, or efficiency-enhancing, depending upon the setting.  More specifically, we exhibit the potential for anticompetitive effects in non-coincident markets (that is, markets other than the ones in which exclusive dealing is practiced), and we explore the potential for the enhancement of efficiency in a setting where common representation gives rise to incentive conflicts.  In each instance, we describe the manner in which equilibrium outcomes would be altered by a ban on exclusive dealing.  We demonstrate that a ban may have surprisingly subtle and unintended effects.\n\n",
