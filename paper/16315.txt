ABSTRACT
We develop a competitive equilibrium theory of a market for votes. Before voting on a binary issue,
individuals may buy and sell their votes with each other. We define the concept of Ex Ante Vote-Trading
Equilibrium, identify weak sufficient conditions for existence, and construct one such equilibrium.
We show that this equilibrium must always result in dictatorship and the market generates welfare
losses, relative to simple majority voting, if the committee is large enough. We test the theoretical
implications by implementing a competitive vote market in the laboratory using a continuous open-book
multi-unit double auction.

Introduction

When confronted with the choice between two alternatives, groups, committees, and legislatures typically rely on majority rule. They do so for good reasons: as shown by May (1952),
in binary choices, majority rule is the unique fair, decisive and monotonic rule. In addition,
majority rule creates incentives for sincere voting: in environments with private values, it
does so regardless of the information that voters have about others’ preferences. A long
tradition in political theory analyzes conditions under which majority voting yields optimal
public decisions or has other desirable properties.1
An obvious weakness of majority rule is its failure to reflect intensity of preferences: an
almost indiﬀerent majority will always prevail over an intense minority. However, if votes
can be freely traded as if they were commodities, then preference intensities could be reflected in the final vote. A natural intuition comes from the general theory of competitive
equilibrium. Just as markets allocate goods in a way that reflects preferences, vote markets
may allow voters who care more about the decision to buy more votes (and hence more influence), compensating other voters with money transfers (see, e.g., Buchanan and Tullock,
1962, Coleman, 1966, Haefele, 1971, Mueller, 1973, and Philipson and Snyder, 1996). On the
other hand, a critique against vote markets arises from the externalities that bilateral vote
trading imposes on third parties. Brams and Riker (1973), for instance, present examples
in which exchanges of votes across issues are profitable to the pair of traders involved, and
yet the committee obtains a Pareto inferior outcome. McKelvey and Ordeshook (1980) test
the hypothesis in experimental data and conclude that the examples are not just theoretical
curiosities, but can actually be observed in the laboratory. Unfortunately, there is no theoretical work that clearly identifies when we should expect such vote trading ineﬃciencies
to arise in general, and when instead more positive results might emerge.2 To date there is
no adequate model of decentralized trade for vote markets and so general questions about
equilibrium allocations when voters can exchange votes with each other remain unanswered.
This article seeks to answer, in the context of a relatively simple environment, two basic
questions about vote trading in committees operating under majority rule. First, from a
positive standpoint, what allocations and outcomes will arise in equilibrium if votes can be
freely exchanged for a numeraire commotidy in a competitive market? Second, what are

There are of course other possible critiques, on distributional and philosophical grounds.

the welfare implications of these equilibrium outcomes, compared to a purely democratic
majority rule institution where buying and selling of votes is not possible?
To answer these questions, we develop a competitive equilibrium model of vote markets
where members of a committee buy and sell votes among themselves in exchange for money.
The committee decides on a binary issue in two stages. In the first stage, members participate
in a perfectly competitive vote market; in the second stage, all members cast their vote(s)
for their favorite alternative, and the committee decision is taken by majority rule.
A market for votes has several characteristics that distinguish it from neoclassical environments. First, the commodities being traded (votes) are indivisible.3 Second, these
commodities have no intrinsic value. Third, because the votes held by one voter can aﬀect
the payoﬀs to other voters, vote markets bear some similarity to markets for commodities
with externalities: demands are interdependent, in the sense that an agent’s own demand is
a function of not only the prices, but also the demands of other traders. Fourth, payoﬀs are
discontinuous at the points in which majority changes, and at this point many voters may
be pivotal simultaneously.
Because of these distinctive properties of vote markets, a major theoretical obstacle to
understanding how vote trading works in general is that in the standard competitive model
of exchange, equilibrium (as well as other standard concepts such as the core) often fail
to exist (Park, 1967; Kadane, 1972; Bernholtz, 1973, 1974; Ferejohn, 1974; Schwartz 1977,
1981; Shubik and Van der Heyden, 1978; Weiss, 1988, Philipson and Snyder, 1996, Piketty,
1994). Philipson and Snyder (1996) illustrate the point with an example along the lines of
the following: Suppose there are three voters, Lynn and Lucy, on one side of an issue, and
Mary, with more intense preferences than either Lynn or Lucy, on the other. Any positive
price supporting a vote allocation where either side has more than two votes cannot be an
equilibrium: one vote is redundant, and for any positive price it will be oﬀered for sale. Any
positive price supporting Mary’s purchase of one vote cannot be an equilibrium: if Mary
buys one vote, say Lynn’s, then Lucy’s vote is worthless, so Lucy would be willing to sell
it for any positive price - again there is excess supply. But any positive price supporting
no trade cannot be an equilibrium either: if the price is at least as high as Mary’s high
valuation, both Lynn and Lucy prefer to sell, and again there is excess supply; if the price

For discussions of nonexistence problems in general equilibrium models with indivisible goods, see Bevia et al (1999), Bikhchandani & Mamer (1997), Danilov et al (2001), Fujishige and Yang (2002), Gul &
Stacchetti (1999) or Yang (2000).

is lower than Mary’s valuation, Mary prefers to buy and there is excess demand. Finally, at
zero price, the losing side always demands a vote, and again there must be excess demand.
Philipson and Snyder (1996) and Koford (1982) circumvent the problem of nonexistence by
formulating models with centralized markets and a market-maker. Both papers argue that
vote markets are generally beneficial.
Other researchers have conjectured, plausibly, that nonexistence arises in this example
because the direction of preferences is known, and hence losing votes are easily identified and
worthless (Piketty, 1994). According to this view, the problem should not occur if voters
are uncertain about others voters’ preferences. But in fact nonexistence is still a problem.
In our example, suppose that Mary, Lynn, and Lucy each know their own preferences but
otherwise only know that the other two are equally likely to prefer either alternative. A
positive price supporting an allocation of votes such that all are concentrated in the hands
of one of them cannot be an equilibrium: as in the discussion above, one vote is redundant,
and the voter would prefer to sell it. But any positive price supporting an allocation where
one individual holds two votes cannot be an equilibrium either: that individual holds the
majority of votes and thus dictates the outcome; the remaining vote is worthless and would
be put up for sale. Finally, a price supporting an allocation where Mary, Lynn and Lucy
each hold one vote cannot be an equilibrium. By buying an extra vote, each of them can
increase the probability of obtaining the desired alternative from 3/4 (the probability that
at least one of the other two agrees with her) to 1; by selling their vote, each decreases such
a probability from 3/4 to 1/2 (the probability that the 2-vote individual agrees). Recall that
Mary’s preferences are the most intense, and suppose Lynn’s are weakest. Thus if the price
is lower than 1/4 Mary’s high valuation, Mary prefers to buy, and if the price is higher than
1/4 Lynn’s low valuation, Lynn prefers to sell. The result must be either excess demand,
or excess supply, or both, in all cases an imbalance. The conclusion is that there is still no
general model of decentralized vote markets for which a competitive equilibrium exists.
In this paper, we respond to these challenges by modifying the concept of equilibrium.
Specifically, we propose a notion of equilibrium that we call Ex Ante Equilibrium. As in the
competitive equilibrium of an exchange economy with externalities, we require voters to best
reply both to the equilibrium price and to other voters’ demands. In addition, to solve the
non-convexity problem, we allow for mixed —i.e., probabilistic— demands. This introduces
the possibility that markets will not clear. Thus, instead of requiring that supply equals
demand in equilibrium with probability one, in the ex ante vote trading equilibrium we
3

require market clearing only in expectation. The ex post clearing of the market is obtained
through a rationing rule.4
In our model individuals have privately known preferences, and we prove existence of an
ex ante vote trading equilibrium for a large set of parameters under a particular rationing
rule. The proof is constructive. One striking property of the equilibrium is that there is
always a dictator: i.e., when the market closes, one voter owns ( + 1)2 votes. The dictator
must be one of the two individuals with most intense preferences. When the number of
voters is small and the discrepancy between the highest valuations and all others is large,
the market for votes may increase expected welfare. But the required condition for eﬃciency
gains is highly restrictive, increasingly so for larger numbers of voters. We show that if the
number of voters is suﬃciently large, the market must be less eﬃcient than simple majority
voting without a vote market.
We test our theoretical results in an experiment by implementing the market in a laboratory with a continuous open-book multi-unit double auction.. Observed transaction prices
support the the comparative statics properties of the ex ante competitive equilibrium. Price
levels are generally higher than the risk-neutral equilibrium price. The prices fall over time
with experience, but in most cases remain significantly higher than the risk neutral prices.
We show that equilibrium price levels will be higher with risk-averse traders, while the comparative statics results remain unchanged, therby providing one possible explanation for
experimental findings. Vote allocations are close to the ex ante equilibrium allocations, and
the empirical eﬃciency of our laboratory markets closely tracks the theory.
Two other strands of literature are not directly related to the present article, but should
be mentioned. First, there is the important but diﬀerent literature on vote markets where
candidates or lobbies buy voters’ or legislators’ votes: for example, Myerson (1993), Groseclose & Snyder (1996), Dal Bo (2007), Dekel, Jackson and Wolinsky (2008) and (2009). These
papers diﬀer from the problem we study because in our case vote trading happens within
the committee (or the electorate). The individuals buying votes are members, not external
subjects, groups or parties. Second, vote markets are not the only remedy advocated for majority rule’s failure to recognize intensity of preferences in binary decisions. The mechanism
design literature has proposed mechanisms with side payments, building on Groves-Clarke
4

Mixed demands have been used elsewhere in general equilibrium analysis, for example in Prescott and
Townsend (1982). In their model, markets clear exactly, even with mixed demands, because there is a
continuum of agents and no aggregate uncertainty. In our markets the number of agents is finite and there
is aggregate uncertainty.

taxes (e.g., d’Apremont and Gerard-Varet 1979). However, these mechanisms have problems
with bankruptcy, individual rationality, and/or budget balance (Green and Laﬀont 1980,
Mailath and Postlewaite 1990). A more recent literature has suggested alternative voting
rules without transfers. Casella (2005), Jackson & Sonnenschein (2007) and Hortala-Vallve
(2007) propose mechanisms whereby agents can eﬀectively reflect their relative intensities
and improve over majority rule, by linking decisions across issues. Casella, Gelman & Palfrey
(2007), Casella, Palfrey and Riezman (2008), Engelmann and Grimm (2008), and HortalaVallve & Llorente-Saguer (2009) test the performance of these mechanisms experimentally
and find that eﬃciency levels are very close to theoretical equilibrium predictions, even in
the presence of some deviations from theoretical equilibrium strategies.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2.1 defines the basic setup of our
model. Section 2.2 introduces the notion of ex ante equilibrium. Section 2.3 presents the
rationing rule. Section 2.4 shows existence by characterizing an equilibrium. Section 2.5
compares welfare obtained in equilibrium to simple majority rule. We then turn to the
experimental part. Section 3 describes the design of the experiment, and section 4 describes
the experimental results. Finally, section 5 discusses possible extensions. Section 6 concludes,
and the Appendix collects all proofs.

2.1

The Model
Setup

Because we define a new equilibrium concept, we present it in a general setting. Some of the
parameters will be specialized in our subsequent analysis and in the experiment. Consider
a committee  of voters,  = {1 2 },  odd, deciding on a single binary issue through
a two-stage procedure. Each voter  is endowed with an amount  of the numeraire, and
with  ∈ Z indivisible votes, where Z is the set of integers. Both  = (1    ) and
 = (1    ) are common knowledge. In the first stage, voters can buy votes from each
other using the numeraire; in the second stage, voters cast their vote(s), if any, for one of
the two alternatives, and a committee decision, , is taken according to the majority of
votes cast. Ties are resolved by a coin flip. The model of exchange naturally focuses on
the first stage and we simply assume that in the second stage voters vote for their favorite

5

alternative.5
The two alternatives are denoted by  = { }, and voter ’s favorite alternative,  ∈ ,
is privately known. For each  the probability that  =  is equal to   and  = ( 1    )
is common knowledge. Let  = { ∈ Z ≥ − } be the set of possible demands of each
agent.6 That is, agent  can oﬀer to sell some or all of his votes, do nothing, or demand any
positive amount of votes. The set of actions of voter  is the set of probability measures on
 , denoted Σ . We write  = 1 ×  ×  and let Σ = Σ1 ×  × Σ . Elements of Σ are of
P
the form  :  → R where ∈  () = 1 and  () ≥ 0 for all  ∈ .
We allow for an equilibrium in mixed strategies where, ex post, the aggregate amounts of
votes demanded and of votes oﬀered need not coincide. A rationing rule  is an institution
that maps the profile of voters’ demands to a feasible allocation of votes. We denote the set
¯P
©
P ª
of feasible vote allocations by  =  ∈ Z+ ¯  =  . Formally, a rationing rule 
is a function from realized demand profiles to the set of probability distributions over vote
P
 = 0. Hence,
allocations:  :  → ∆ where  ∈ ]   +  [ ∀ and  () =  +  if
a rationing rule must fulfill several conditions: a)  cannot assign less (more) votes than
the initial endowment if the demand is positive (negative), b)  cannot assign more (less)
votes than the initial endowment plus the demand if the demand is positive (negative) and
c) if aggregate demand and aggregate supply of votes coincide, then all agents’ demands are
satisfied.
The particular (mixed) action profile,  ∈ Σ, and the rationing rule, , jointly imply
a probability distribution over the set of final vote allocations that we denote as  ().
In addition, for every possible allocation we define the probability that the committee decision coincides with voter ’s favorite alternative, a probability we denote by   :=
Pr ( =  |  ) - where  ∈  is the vote allocation and  ∈ .
Finally, we define voters’ preferences. The preferences of voter  are represented by a von
Neuman Morgenstern utility function  , a concave function of the argument  1= +  −
( −  ) , where  ∈ [0 1] is a privately known valuation earned if the committee decision
 coincides with the voter’s preferred alternative  , 1 is the indicator function,  is ’s
endowment of the numeraire, ( −  ) is ’s net demand for votes, and  is the transaction
price per vote.
We can now define  (  ), the ex ante utility of voter  given some action profile,

One can see in the formula that the uncertainty about the final outcome depends on three
factors: a) the action profile, b) the rationing rule and c) the preferences of other voters.

2.2

Ex Ante Vote Trading Equilibrium

Definition 1 The set of actions ∗ and the price ∗ constitute an Ex Ante Vote Trading Equilibrium (or, simply, Ex Ante Equilibrium) relative to rationing rule  if the
following conditions are satisfied:

The definition of the equilibrium shares some features of competitive equilibrium with
externalities (e.g., Arrow and Hahn, 1971, pp. 132-6). Optimal demands are interrelated, and
thus equilibrium requires voters to best reply to the demands of other voters. In contrast, the
standard notion of competitive equilibrium for good markets requires agents to best-respond
only to the price. The diﬀerence between the Ex Ante Equilibrium and the competitive
equilibrium with externalities is that the former notion requires market clearing only in
expected terms. The fact that demand and supply do not necessarily balance is the reason
for the introduction of the rationing rule.7
7

There always exists a trivial equilibrium, where, independently of the particular rationing rule and
endowments, all voters neither demand nor oﬀer any vote: the market clears and, since the probability of
being rationed is 1, all voters are maximizing utility. This paper focuses on a nontrivial equilibrium where
some trade occurs.

7

2.3

Rationing by voter

In general, the specification of the rationing rule can aﬀect the existence (or not) of the
equilibrium, and if an equilibrium exists, its properties. In this paper, we mainly focus
on one specific rule, rationing-by-voter (1), whereby each voter either fulfills his demand
(supply) completely or is excluded from trade. After voters submit their orders, demanders
and suppliers of votes are randomly ranked in a list, all rankings having the same probability.
Then demands are satisfied in turn: the demand of the first voter on the list is satisfied with
the first supplier(s) on the list; then the demand of the second voter on the list is satisfied
with the first supplier(s) on the list with oﬀers still outstanding, and so on. In case someone’s
demand cannot be satisfied, the voter is left with his initial endowment, and the process goes
on with the next of the list.
1 fulfills the conditions given in section 2.1. However, one aspect of this rationing rule
is that it is possible for both sides of the market to be rationed. For example:
Example 1 Suppose that voters 1, 2 and 3 oﬀer to sell one vote and that voters 4 and 5
demand 2 votes each. The total supply (3 votes) is less than the total demand (4 votes). 1
will result in one supplier and one demander left with their initial endowments.
We show in section 5 that our results continue to hold with little change under an alternative rationing rule we call rationing-by-vote ( 2), where individual votes supplied are
randomly allocated to each voter with an unfulfilled demand. With 2, only the long side
of the market is rationed, but individuals must accept, and pay for, orders that are only
partially filled.

2.4

Equilibrium

For the rest of the paper we assume that each voter prefers either alternative with probability
1/2 (  = 05) and is initially endowed with one vote ( = 1). In addition, we assume for
now that all individuals are risk-neutral; in section 5 we show that the results extend to risk
averse preferences. For simplicity, we set the initial endowment of money to zero ( = 0 for
all )—the value of  plays no role with risk-neutrality, and thus the restriction is with no
loss of generality; depending on preferences, it could play a role with risk aversion. In this
section we prove by construction the existence of an ex ante equilibrium when the rationing
rule is 1 and a weak suﬃcient condition is satisfied.

Demanding other quantities is strictly dominated: a smaller quantity can be accommodated

costly and redundant if  − 1 is not rationed.

In this equilibrium, voters 1 to  − 2 always oﬀer to sell their vote, and voter  always

demands the minimum number of votes to ensure himself a simple majority. The price
makes voter  − 1 indiﬀerent between demanding the number of votes that would give him
a majority and oﬀering his own vote for sale. Finally, ex ante market clearing pins down the
probability with which voter  − 1 randomizes between oﬀering to buy and oﬀering to sell.
The equilibrium has four key features. First, and most striking, after rationing either
voter  or voter  − 1 will have a majority of votes: in equilibrium there always is a dictator. A market for votes does not distribute votes somewhat equally among high valuation
individuals: in our ex ante vote trading equilibrium, it concentrates all decision-power in
+3
, and voter
the hands of a single voter. The dictator will be voter  with probability 2(+1)
−1
−1
 − 1 with complementary probability 2(+1) ; in either case, the dictator pays 2 voters for
their votes.
Second, the price of a vote is linked to the second highest valuation. The market can
be loosely thought of as analogous to auctioning oﬀ the right to be a dictator on the issue,
and thus it is not surprising that the equilibrium price is determined by the second highest
valuation. In fact, the equilibrium price is precisely the price at which the second highest
valuation voter is indiﬀerent between "winning" the dictatorship or selling his vote and
letting someone else be the dictator. Note that the value added from being dictator is
bounded below 1/2 (1, the upper boundary of the support of  , times 1/2, the probability
that the voter who has become dictator in one’s stead favors the same alternative), while in
the limit, as  approaches ∞, more and more votes are needed to become dictator. Thus the
equilibrium price per vote must converge to zero. On the other hand, the total cost or "price
−1
· +1
, which converges to −1
, the value of dictatorship
of dictatorship" in the market is −1

to the second highest valuation voter.
Third, rationing occurs with probability 1: there is always either excess demand or
excess supply of votes. The larger the committee size, the higher the probability that voter
 − 1 demands votes, and thus the higher the probability of positive excess demand. As 
approaches ∞, with probability approaching 1, demand exceeds supply by one vote. Relative
to the amounts traded, the imbalance is of order (1), and thus negligible in volume,
recalling analyses of competitive equilibria with non-convexities (in particular the notion of
Approximate Equilibrium, where in large economies allocations approach demands.8 ) But,
contrary to private goods markets, in our market the imbalance is never negligible in its
impact on welfare: it always triggers rationing and shuts ( − 1)2 voters out of the market.

Fourth, the existence of this equilibrium requires a suﬃcient "gap" between the highest
and the second highest valuation. The gap is needed it to ensure that voter  is not better
−1
at the equilibrium price, ∗ = +1
. The assumption,
oﬀ selling his vote than demanding −1
2
however, is very weak, in the sense that the required gap is extremely small. In the proof,
an exact bound is derived9 : the condition reduces to a minimum required percentage gap
between  and −1 of 3 percent when  = 7, declining thereafter, and rapidly converging
to 0 as  gets large. Figure 1 plots the required percentage gap (i.e., the minimum value of
 − −1 , normalized by −1 = 1) as a function of .

2.5

Welfare

In this section we compare the welfare obtained in the ex ante equilibrium to a situation
without market, where voters simply cast their votes for their favorite alternative.
As remarked earlier, in the equilibrium characterized in Theorem 1 the vote market always
results in dictatorship, with the dictator being either the voter with highest valuation, or,
slightly less often, the voter with the second highest valuation. Even taking into account
the dictator’s high valuation, ignoring the will of all voters but one seems unlikely to be a
desirable rule. Indeed, our main welfare result is that if  is suﬃciently large, the vote market
is ineﬃcient relative to the majority rule outcome with no trade. At smaller committee sizes,

the market can be welfare improving only if the profile of valuations is such that there is a
large diﬀerence between the highest valuation (or two highest valuations) and the rest.
Ex ante welfare analysis is complicated by the requirement that valuations satisfy the
condition identified in Theorem 1. One alternative is to specify a joint distribution of valuations  () with  = (1    ) such that all draws of valuation profiles admit the equilibrium
of Theorem 1. A simpler alternative, which we follow in this section, is to fix , and a profile
of valuations  that satisfies the condition in Theorem 1, and study the expected welfare
associated with such profile in an infinite replication of the market and the vote. Focusing
on an infinite replication means abstracting from specific realizations of the direction of preferences, of the realized demand of voter  − 1, and of the resolution of the rationing rule,
relying instead on the theoretical probabilities.
For given  and , with 1     , expected welfare with the market,   , and with
majority rule,  , are given by

The larger the number of voters, the larger is the expected cost of dictatorship, and the
more skewed the distribution of valuations must be for the market to be eﬃciency enhancing.
At suﬃciently large , as long as   −2 is finite, the market must be ineﬃcient.
The result is illustrated in Figure 2. The figure plots the area in which the vote market
dominates majority rule, the area in which the reverse is true, and the very small area in
which the equilibrium of Theorem 1 does not exist. The vertical axis is the ratio of the

The two cases  = 5 and  = 9 are the committee sizes we study in the experiment, and
the symbols in the figures correspond to the experimental valuations’ profiles. At  = 501,
the region of possible realizations violating the condition in Theorem 1 cannot be detected
in the figure, and the vote market dominates majority rule only if the highest valuation is
at a minimum about twenty times as high as the average of valuations 1 to −2 .
The conclusion, logically straightforward given Theorem 1, contradicts common intuitions about vote markets. In the absence of budget inequalities and common values, a
market for votes is often believed to dominate simple majority rule because it is expected to
redistribute voting power from low intensity voters to high intensity voters.10 Although such
a redistribution is confirmed in our analysis, in equilibrium it occurs in extreme fashion: the
eﬃciency conjecture generally fails because all decision power is concentrated in the hands
of a single individual.

Experimental Design

A model of vote markets is diﬃcult if not impossible to be tested with existingdata: actual
vote trading is generally not available in the public record, and in many cases is prohibited
by law. We must turn to the economics laboratory. However, exactly how to do this is not
obvious. Like most competitive equilibrium theories, our modeling approach abstracts from
the exact details of a trading mechanism. Rather than specifying an exact game form, the
model is premised on the less precise assumption that under suﬃciently competitive forces
the equilibrium price will emerge following the law of supply and demand. But because of the
nature of votes, a vote market diﬀers substantially from traditional competitive markets, and
our equilibrium concept is non-standard in the sense that markets clear only in expectation.

Does this new competitive equilibrium concept applied to the diﬀerent voting environment
have any predictive value? Will a laboratory experiment organized in a similar way to
standard laboratory markets (Smith 1965) lead to prices, allocations and comparative statics
in accord with ex ante competitive equilibrium? These are the main question we address in
this and next section.
Experiments were conducted at the Social Sciences and Economics Laboratory at Caltech
during June 2009, with Caltech undergraduate students from diﬀerent disciplines. Eight
sessions were run in total, four of them with five subjects and four with nine. No subject
participated in more than one session. All interactions among subjects were computerized,
using an extension of the open source software package, Multistage Games.11
The voters in an experimental session constituted a committee whose charge was to decide
on a binary outcome, X or Y. Each subject was randomly assigned to be either in favor of X
or in favor of Y with equal probability and was given a valuation that s/he would earn if the
subject’s preferred outcome was the committee decision. Subjects knew that others would
also prefer either X or Y with equal probability and that they were assigned valuations,
diﬀerent for each subject, belonging to the range [1,1000], but did not know either others’
preferred outcome or the realizations of valuations, nor were they given any information on
the distribution of valuations.
All subjects were endowed with one vote. After being told their own private valuation
and their own preferred outcome, but before voting, there was a 2 minute trading stage,
during which subjects had the opportunity to buy or sell votes. After the trading stage, the
process moved to the voting stage, where the decision was made by majority rule. At this
stage, voters simply cast all their votes which were automatically counted in favor of their
preferred outcome. Once all subjects had voted, the results were reported back to everyone
in the committee, the information was displayed in a history table on their computer screens,
viewable throughout the experiment.
We designed the trading mechanism as a continuous double auction, following closely the
experimental studies of competitive markets for private goods and assets (see for example
Smith, 1982, Forsythe, Palfrey and Plott 1982, Gray and Plott, 1990, and Davis and Holt,
1992). At any time during the trading period, any subject could post a bid or an oﬀer for
one or multiple votes. Bid and oﬀer prices (per vote) could be any integer in the range from

active bids or oﬀers could be accepted and this information was immediately updated on
the computer screens of all voters. A bid or oﬀer for more than one unit was not transacted
until the entire order had been filled. Active bids or oﬀers that had not been fully transacted
could be cancelled at any time by the voter who placed the order. The number of votes that
diﬀerent voters of the committee held was displayed in real time on each voter’s computer
screen and updated with every transaction. There were two additional trading rules. At
the beginning of the experiment, subjects were loaned an initial amount of cash of 10,000
points, and their cash holdings were updated after each transaction and at the end of the
voting stage. If their cash holdings ever became 0 or negative, they could not place any bid
nor accept any oﬀer until their balance became positive again.12 Second, subjects could not
sell votes if they did not have any or if all the votes they owned were committed.
Once the voting stage was concluded, the procedure was repeated with the direction of
preference shuﬄed: subjects were again endowed with a single vote, valuation assignments
remained unchanged but the direction of preferences was reassigned randomly and independently, and a new 2-minute trading stage started, followed by voting. We call each repetition,
for a given assignment of valuations, a round. After 5 rounds were completed, a diﬀerent set
of valuations was assigned, and the game was again repeated for 5 rounds. We call each set
of 5 rounds with fixed valuations a match. Each experimental session consisted of 4 matches,
that is, in each session subjects were assigned 4 diﬀerent sets of valuations. Thus in total a
session consisted of 20 rounds.
The sets of valuations were designed according to two criteria. First, we wanted to
compare market behavior and pricing with valuations that were on average low (L), or on
average high (H); second, we wanted to compare results with valuations concentrated at
the bottom of the distribution (B), and with valuations concentrated at the top (T). This
second feature was designed to test the theoretical welfare prediction: when valuations are
concentrated at the bottom, the wedge between the top valuations and all others is larger,
and thus the vote market should perform best, relative to majority voting. The B treatments
correspond to the triangle (HB) and square (LB) symbols in Figure 2
For either  = 5 or  = 9, each of the 4 combinations, LB, LT, HB and HT, thus
corresponds to a specific set of valuations. We call each a market. The exact values are
12

The liquidity constraint was rarely binding, and bankruptcy never occurred. By the end of the last
market, all subjects had positive cash holdings, even after loan repayment.

Sessions with the same number of subjects diﬀered in the order of the diﬀerent markets,
as described in Table 2. Because, for given , the equilibrium price depends only on the
second highest valuation, HT and HB markets (and LT and LB markets) have the same
equilibrium price. Thus in each session we alternated H and L markets. In addition, because we conjectured that behavior in the experiment could be sensitive to the dispersion in
valuations, we alternated L and T markets. With these constraints, 4 experimental sessions
for each number of subjects were suﬃcient to implement all possible orders of markets.

At the beginning of each session, instructions were read by the experimenter standing
on a stage in the front of the experiment room.14 After the instructions were finished, the
experiment began. Subjects were paid the sum of their earnings over all 20 rounds multiplied
by a pre-determined exchange rate and a show-up fee of $10, in cash, in private, immediately
following the session. Sessions lasted on average one hour and fifteen minutes, and subjects’
average final earnings were $29.
13

Thus the experiment has 8 markets (4 markets for each of  = 5 and  = 9). We obtained the exact
numbers by choosing high values with no focal properties ( = 957 and −1 = 903 for H, ³and ´ = 753

Experimental Results

We organize our discussion of the experimental results by focusing, in turn, on prices, final
vote allocations, and eﬃciency.

4.1

Prices

Figure 4 shows the transaction prices observed in the diﬀerent markets, and the equilibrium
prices. It is clear from the graph that there is significant overpricing: the percentage of
transaction prices above equilibrium is 84% and 99% for committees of sizes 5 and 9 respectively. Risk aversion can explain part of the overpricing: equilibrium prices increase with the
degree of risk-aversion, as we show formally in section 5. However, part of the overpricing is
also due to inexperience, and transaction prices generally decline with experience.

Table 3: Median Prices of Traded Votes. Number of transactions in parentheses.
Median prices are summarized in Table 3; the upper half of the table refers to  = 5
sessions, the lower half to  = 9 sessions. In both half tables, the equilibrium prices for each
market, rounded to the nearest integer, are in the first row ("Theory"). The second row
("All") reports the median price for all transacted votes in each market, over all experimental
sessions (the number of transacted votes is in parenthesis). The third and fourth row report
median prices of transacted votes when subjects have gained some experience: in the third
row are median transacted prices when the given market is implemented as the fourth and
last match of the session ("Last match"); in the fourth row are median transacted prices
focusing only on the last 2 rounds (out of 5) of each match, again with the relevant number
of transacted votes in parenthesis. Thus "Last match" prices reflect trading activity after
subjects have participated in three diﬀerent markets for a total of fifteen rounds, but have
no experience with the specific parameters for the given parameters of the fourth match.
"Last 2 rounds" prices reflect trading activity after subjects have experienced three rounds
with the specific parameters of the given treatment, but have not necessarily had experience
with diﬀerent market parameters.
The overpricing is clear in the table, particularly in markets with 9 participants. However,
the comparative statics implied by ex ante equilibrium are supported by the data. The
theory implies that the market price should be higher in H markets than in L markets,
and higher in markets with 5 participants than in markets with 9.15 There are in total 24
relevant comparisons between H and L market prices in the table, and in 23 out of 24 cases
the median price in the H markets is indeed higher.16 There are 12 relevant comparisons
15
16

In fact, exactly twice as high, since  = −1 ( + 1) and −1 is fixed at the same value.
The only exception is  = 5, median price in the last match only, comparing HT and LB markets.

between  = 5 and  = 9 markets, and again only in one case is the theoretical prediction
violated. The support for the committee size comparison is weakest in LT markets, where
the one violation occurs when the full data set is considered, and where experience leads to
equality in median prices but fails to deliver the disparity implied by the theory. In addition,
all else equal, the equilibrium price does not change between T and B markets. In the data
there are some minor diﬀerences, but no systematic pattern.
As shown in Figure 4, overpricing is typically reduced by experience. Relative to median
prices in the full data set, median prices in the last 2 rounds of each match are either strictly
lower (in four treatments), or equal (in the remaining four treatments); median prices in the
last match are strictly lower than the overall median in six of eight treatments, the exceptions
being the two B treatments with  = 5.
These observations are statistically confirmed in a regression of all transaction prices on
dummies for market characteristics and time variables (match, round, and time within a
round). Prices are significantly higher in H markets, while a null hypothesis of no diﬀerence
between B and T markets cannot be rejected at the 10 percent level. Our two measures of
experience are both negatively correlated with the price for both 5 and 9-subject markets,
and in three out of four cases the measure is statistically significant, if only at the 10 percent
level. The results are summarized in Table 4.

Table 5: Transactions’ Summary

4.2

Vote Allocations

Table 5 summarizes the observed trades. We distinguish between a transaction —a realized
trade between two subjects—and an order—an oﬀer to sell or a bid to buy votes that may
or may not be realized. Note that both orders and transactions in principle may concern
multiple votes: on the purchasing side, it is clearly feasible to demand and buy multiple
units; on the selling side, although subjects enter the market endowed with a single vote,
they could resell in bulk votes they have purchased. For each committee size, the first row is
the average number of transactions per two-minute trading round, in the diﬀerent markets.
The transactions can be read as net trades because the percentage of reselling was in all
cases lower than 5%.17 As the table shows, the number of transactions is quite constant
across markets, and slightly higher than the theoretical prediction of 2 for  = 5 and 4 for
 = 9. Most transactions concerned individual votes (row 2) and indeed so did most orders
in general, not only those that were accepted (row 5). Most transactions also originated
from accepted oﬀers (row 3), and again most orders, whether accepted or not, were oﬀers to
sell, as opposed to bids to buy (row 6).
In order to describe how close the final allocations of votes are to equilibrium, we define
a distance measure : for each market,  equals the minimal number of votes that would
17

We define speculation as the total number of votes that were both bought and sold by the same player.
Averaging across markets, it is 1 percent when  = 5 and 3 percent when  = 9 (there is no systematic eﬀect
across markets).

have to be exchanged between subjects to move from the observed final vote allocation
to an equilibrium vote allocation, averaged over diﬀerent rounds and diﬀerent sessions.18
To evaluate the meaning of specific  values, we compare them to the expected value of
 when the allocation of votes is random - i.e. when each individual vote is allocated to
each subject with equal probability. Calling such a measure , we construct a normalized
distance measure , defined as 1 − , and ranging between 0 and 1.  equals 0 if  = ,
and 1 if  = 0; thus  captures how much of the gap between the equilibrium allocation and
the random allocation is closed by the experimental data.
Table 6 summarizes the results. Range reports the minimum and maximum distance
observed across diﬀerent rounds; and Upper Bound the maximal possible distance for each
market and committee size. The table shows two main regularities. First, data from markets
with valuations concentrated towards the bottom of the range tend to be closer to the
theoretical predictions; the concentration of votes in the hands of the two subjects with
highest valuations is naturally easier to achieve when the remaining voters are relatively
more willing to sell. Second, the smaller committee approaches the theoretical allocation
more closely than the larger committee—the value of  is consistently higher. But it is not
18
For example, consider a committee with five members:  = 5. In equilibrium, members 4 and 5’s
possible vote holdings are: 0 and 3; or 1 and 3; or 3 and 1. The remaining voters must have either 0 or
1 vote. Suppose that the final vector of votes observed in the experiment were (0 1 0 2 2). In this case
 = 1, since we only need to transfer one vote from member 4 to member 5, or from member 5 to member
4. Suppose instead that the vector were (0 1 2 2 0). Now  = 2: we need to transfer 1 vote from member
3 to member 4 and another vote, either from member 2 or 3 to member 5.

clear that this reflects more awareness of equilibrium strategies: concentrating votes into few
hands is more easily achieved when the number of voters is small.
Contrary to prices, distance data show no evidence of learning: in ordered logit regressions
of  (or ) on dummies for market characteristics (H and T), and time variables (match and
round), for both committee sizes, none of the time dummies is statistically significant, even
at the 10 percent level.19

cation of votes across individual subjects. But diﬀerent vote allocations can have identical
, and yet quite diﬀerent impacts on welfare. For instance, according to the theory the
behavior of voters 1 to  − 2 should be identical. Therefore, the distance to equilibrium of
(3 0 0 1 1) and (0 0 3 1 1) is the same—but the expected welfare of the first allocation is
substantially inferior to the second.
Figure 6 shows the average number of votes held by subjects at the end of each round,
compared to the equilibrium prediction. Subjects are ordered on the horizontal axis, from
lowest to highest valuation. Again, markets with valuations concentrated at the bottom of
the distributions (B) appear to conform to the theory relatively well: the highest valuation
subjects end the round with a large fraction of the votes. In particular, if the market is
LB, the distribution of votes across subjects does increase sharply for the highest valuation
subjects, exactly as the theory suggests, and this is true for both  = 9 and  = 5. But in
markets with valuations concentrated at the top of the distribution (T), the results deviate
from the theory: the highest valuation subjects demand fewer votes on average than their
equilibrium demand, and the number of votes held increases smoothly as the valuations
increase.
Finally, Table 7 shows the observed frequency of dictatorship for diﬀerent markets and
diﬀerent committee sizes. In  = 5 committees, dictatorship emerges two thirds of the time,

a frequency that although lower than the theoretical prediction of one hundred percent, we
still find remarkable. In the LB market, the data do match the theory perfectly in this
regard: out of 20 rounds, in four diﬀerent experimental sessions, all 20 result in dictatorship.
In  = 9 committees, where the purchase of four, as opposed to two, votes is required for
dictatorship, the results are much weaker, with an average frequency of dictatorship of 12
percent. In T markets, where valuations are concentrated at the top of the distribution,
competition among the higher-value subjects clearly works against the concentration of five
votes in the hand of the same subject; in B markets, dictatorship does in fact occur, between
one fifth and one fourth of the times, a weak result compared to the theory but still a
non-negligible frequency.
The probability of dictatorship increases with learning. A probit regression of the probability of a dictator as function of market characteristics (H and T dummies), and time
dummies for round and match shows that the probability is significantly higher in the last
round of each match if  = 5, or in the last match of each session if  = 9, with significance
at the 1 percent level. In addition, as Table 7 shows, the probability is significantly lower in
T markets, and, if  = 5, in H markets. The results are reported in Table 8.

4.3

Welfare

In this section we analyze the payoﬀs obtained by our committees and compare them to the
equilibrium predictions and to the majority rule benchmark.
In theory, the equilibrium strategy is invariant to the direction of a voter’s preferences.
In the experiment, subjects participated in the market and submitted their orders without
information about others’ realized preferred alternative (or indeed about others’ valuations)
– all they knew was that any subject was assigned either alternative as preferred with
probability 1/2. Thus a voter’s trading behavior should be independent of both its own and
other voters’ realized direction of preferences. When evaluating the welfare implications of
a specific vote allocation, the exact realization of the direction of preferences matters, but,
as we argued in section 2.5 the interesting welfare measure is the average welfare associated
with such an allocation, for all possible realizations of the directions of preferences. It is
such a measure that we calculate on the basis of the experimental data and present in Table
9.
For each profile of valuations and for each realized allocation of votes, we compute the
average aggregate payoﬀ for all possible profiles of preferences’ directions, weighted by the
probability of their realization. For each profile of valuations, we then average the result
again, over all realized allocations of votes, and obtain   , our measure of experimental
payoﬀs for each market. We compute the equivalent measure with majority voting,  –
that is, for each profile of valuations, for all possible realizations of preferences’ directions,
we resolve the disagreement in favor of the more numerous side; taking into account the
probability of each realization, we then compute the average aggregate payoﬀ. To ease the
comparison of payoﬀs across the two institutions, the diﬀerent markets, and the diﬀerent
committee sizes, we express both   and  as share of the average maximum payoﬀ
that the subjects could appropriate, normalized by a floor given by the average minimum
possible payoﬀ. The average maximum payoﬀ,  , is calculated by selecting the alternative
favored by the side with higher aggregate valuation, for each realization of preferences; the
average minimum payoﬀ,  , corresponds to selecting the alternative favored by the side
with lower aggregate valuation. The welfare score then is: (  −  )( −  ), and
correspondingly for majority voting.
Table 9 displays the experimental welfare scores, aggregated over all rounds and all
matches, for each market and for either committee size, together with the theoretical predic-

tions, and the corresponding welfare scores with majority rule.21 The table highlights several interesting regularities. First, realized welfare mimics equilibrium welfare more closely
in markets with low valuations, indeed very closely in three out of four cases. In markets
with high valuations, realized welfare is consistently higher than predicted welfare. Second,
Proposition 1 predicts that vote markets should perform better, relative to majority, when
valuations are concentrated at the bottom of the distributions. In particular, vote markets
should dominate majority in market LB, be slightly worse in market HB, and substantially
worse in markets LT and HT, for both committee sizes. In our data, vote markets had higher
average payoﬀs than majority in both B treatments, although only barely in market HB.
In T treatments, where valuations are concentrated at the top of the distribution, majority
rule outperforms our experimental results, a conclusion that remains true even though, as
we saw, subjects deviated from equilibrium towards a more equalitarian allocation of votes,
and thus were closer to majority rule than theory predicts. Finally, realized welfare is always
(weakly) higher than equilibrium welfare, reflecting a lower frequency of dictatorship than
predicted by theory.

Extensions
An Alternative Rationing Rule

The rationing rule plays a central role in guaranteeing existence and characterizing the ex
ante vote trading equilibrium. A reasonable concern then is that our theoretical results
could be quite special and disappear when using alternative rules. We show here that the
21

We consider all rounds and all matches because, as we saw in previous section, we do not find significant
temporal evolution in final vote allocations.

29

analysis is robust to the most plausible alternative. Consider the following rule, which we
call rationing-by-vote, or 2: If voters’ orders result in excess demand, any vote supplied
is randomly allocated to one of the individuals with outstanding purchasing orders, with
equal probability. An order remains outstanding until it has been completely filled. When
all supply is allocated, each individual who put in an order must purchase all units that have
been directed to him, even if the order is only partially filled. If there is excess supply, the
votes to be sold are chosen randomly from each seller, with equal probability.
As mentioned earlier, contrary to rationing-by-voter, or 1, rationing-by-vote guarantees
that the short side of the market is never rationed, but forces individuals to accept partially
filled orders. To illustrate the diﬀerence, recall example 1 where three voters supply one
vote each, and two voters demand two votes each. Here, 1 rations one demander and one
supplier; with 2, no supplier is rationed, and the two voters demanding two votes each are
settled with two and one vote. Buying and paying for one’s partial order when a diﬀerent
voter exits the market holding a majority of votes is clearly suboptimal.
Proposition 2 Suppose   = 12 ,  = 1, and  = 0 ∀, agents are risk neutral, and 2
is the rationing rule. Then there exist  and a finite threshold  () ≥ 1 such that for all
 ≤  and −1 ≥ ()−2 the following set of price and actions constitute an Ex Ante

satisfied in our experimental treatments. Note that with risk neutrality the constraint  = 0
∀ is again irrelevant, and imposed for simplicity of notation only.
The equilibrium is almost identical to the equilibrium with 1, with two diﬀerences. First,
because orders can be filled partially, rationing can be particularly costly. In equilibrium, if
30

voter  − 1 attempts to buy, either he or voter  will be required to pay for votes that are
strictly useless (since the other voter will hold a majority stake). To support voter  − 1’s
−1
mixed strategy, the equilibrium price is lower than with the original rationing rule: 2(−1)
−1
instead of +1
. Second, and again because of the possibility of filling partial orders, lower
valuation voters can use their own orders strategically, refraining from selling to increase
the probability that no dictator emerges. To rule out the possibility of such a deviation,
the price must be high enough, relative to their valuation. This is the reason for requiring
−1 ≥ ()−2 .
With these two caveats, the change in rationing rule has little eﬀect. In particular,
equilibrium vote trading results in dictatorship, and the welfare implications are similar.

5.2

Risk Aversion

So far we have assumed risk neutrality. A natural extension is to analyze how risk aversion
changes our results. The next proposition shows that the demands presented in Theorem 1
can be supported as an equilibrium when all agents have CARA utility functions with the
same risk aversion parameter.
Proposition 3 Suppose  = 12 ,  = 1, and  = 0 ∀, (·) = −−(·) with   0,
and 1 is the rationing rule. Then for all  there exists a finite threshold  ≥ 1 such
that if  ≥  −1 , the set of actions presented in Theorem 1 together with the price  =

Proof. See appendix.

The logic is virtually identical to the logic of Theorem 1. As in the case of risk neutrality,
the equilibrium price makes voter −1 indiﬀerent between selling and demanding a majority
of votes. Hence again the price is a function of −1 . The eﬀect of higher risk aversion can
be seen in the implicit equation that defines  The equation is valid for any utility function

thus equals (−1 − 2 ) with certainty. Higher risk aversion— more concave  (·)—must lead
to an increase in the equilibrium price. The intuition is clear: fixing the price, an increase
in risk aversion makes the riskier lottery of selling less attractive relatively to demanding a
majority of votes. In order to make voter  − 1 indiﬀerent, the price must be higher.
As in the case of Theorem 1, the equilibrium is supported if there is a suﬃcient gap
between the highest and the second highest valuation. But once again the required gap
is very small, indeed smaller than with risk neutrality in all numerical cases we studied.23
Figure 7 shows the minimum required gap with CARA utility, for the two cases of  = 1
(the dashed line) and  = 2 (the dotted line), and as reference for risk neutrality (the solid
line), as function of . The minimum gap is always smaller than 1 percent if  = 1 and
smaller than half a percent if  = 2, and disappears asymptotically as  increases. We have
verified numerically that the condition is satisfied by our experimental parameters for all
 ∈ (0 1000].
23

A natural conjecture is that the gap condition is always easier to satisfy with risk aversion than with
risk neutrality.

32

Evidence for risk aversion has been documented in experiments across a broad spectrum
of environments, ranging from auctions to abstract games.24 We conjecture that it may be
a significant factor in explaining the high prices we observe in our data. How much can
the price increase with risk aversion? The upper bound on the price increase is given by
an "infinitely" risk averse agent, an agent uniquely motivated by the lowest payoﬀ of the

lottery. Hence, the infinitely risk averse agent will be indiﬀerent whenever  = 2 +1

likely to play a role but other factors must be present too, suggesting an interesting question
for future research.
Figure 8 plots the equilibrium price with CARA relative to the price with risk neutrality
for  = 5 and  = 9. As the level of risk aversion increases, the ratio of the price to the
risk neutral price converges to 2. The figure suggests two further regularities. First, fixing
the level of risk aversion, an increase in committee size induces an increase in the relative
equilibrium price. Second, relatively low levels of risk aversion translate into large increases
in the price. In the case of  = 5,  = 1 (= 2) implies a 40% (60%) increment of the
equilibrium price with respect to the risk neutral benchmark.

Conclusions

This paper proposes and tests a competitive equilibrium to study allocations resulting from
a market for votes. Vote markets are unique and have properties that require a non-standard
approach. Votes have no intrinsic value, they are lumpy, and acquiring votes simply increases
the probability of creating a good public outcome from the standpoint of the buyer. And
because individuals disagree about what a "good" public outcome is, buying and selling votes
create externalities. We define the concept of Ex Ante Vote-Trading Equilibrium, a concept
that combines the standard price-taking assumption of competitive equilibrium in a market
for goods with less standard assumptions: demands are best responses to the demands of the
other traders, mixed demands are allowed, and market clearing is achieved by a rationing

rule. Using a constructive proof, we establish suﬃcient conditions for existence of an ex
ante equilibrium, in a vote market where voters have incomplete information about other
members’ preferences and a single binary decision has to be made, and we characterize the
properties of this equilibrium.
A striking feature of the equilibrium vote allocation is that there always is a dictator:
with probability one a single trader acquires a majority position. This feature pins down
the welfare properties of the vote market. Because the market results in a dictator, and
because the dictator must be one of the two highest valuation (or intensity) voters, the
welfare eﬀects depend on the distribution of valuations and on the size of the electorate or
committee. When the number of voters is large, the market creates ineﬃciencies relative to
simple majority voting. On average, eﬃciency is higher if the outcome reflects that median
preference rather than the preference of the dictator, even if he is the voter with highest
intensity. Put another way, as  gets larger, the externality problem becomes worse — in
particular it creates more ineﬃciency than the failure of majority rule to reflect intensity
of preferences. In small committees, the eﬃciency result depends on the distribution of
valuations: the externality problem is relatively small, and a market for votes may enhance
eﬃciency, as long as there is a suﬃciently large diﬀerence between the highest valuation and
the average valuation of the  − 2 lowest-valuation voters.
The theoretical findings are examined using data from laboratory market experiments

34

with five and nine person committees, where the vote market was conducted as a continuous
multi-unit double auction. By varying the distribution of valuations and the number of
traders/voters, we controlled the predicted outcomes. In line with the ex ante competitive
equilibrium, prices were higher in smaller committees and in treatments where valuations
were higher. Furthermore, prices did not vary systematically with valuations, once the top
two valuations were fixed. With one exception, experimental prices were significantly higher
than risk neutral equilibrium prices, albeit with significant downward convergence. We show
that one explanation of the observed overpricing is risk aversion. If traders are risk averse,
risk neutral pricing is only a lower bound, and the equilibrium price can be as high as double
the risk neutral equilibrium price.
Observed vote allocations were close to equilibrium allocations, particularly in the B
treatments where the two top valuations were significantly higher than the remainder. In
smaller committees, such treatments resulted in dictatorship more than three quarters of
the times, on average. In larger committees, where the purchase of four votes is required for
dictatorship, the frequency of dictatorship was lower, but dictatorship still arose between one
fourth and one fifth of the times when the discrepancy between the top two valuations and
the others was large. The welfare results matched the theory: average experimental payoﬀs
were higher than majority voting payoﬀs would have been, with the set of experimental
valuations, when the discrepancy between top valuations and all others was large, and were
lower otherwise.
There are still many open questions about vote markets, and in our experiment we explore
only the simplest environment. A key direction of future research is to extend the model to
multiple issues. Here we consider only a one-issue vote market, but in principle the same
approach can be applied to the more general case of committees that vote on multiple issues,
such as legislatures, boards, and standing committees. With multiple issues, the model will
then be able to address questions of vote trading where the market eﬀectively becomes a
means for a voter to accumulate votes on issues he cares most about in exchange for his
vote on issues he cares less about. The welfare properties of multi-issue vote markets are
likely to be more complicated to analyze, and unclear. Extrapolating from our findings
suggests significant ineﬃciencies, as found in other models of vote exchange that focus on
simple bartering examples (Riker and Brams, 1971), rather than taking a general equilibrium
approach as we do here. On the other hand, ineﬃciencies might be somewhat mitigated by
the presence of multiple issues, and the more numerous possibilities for gains from trade, as

Sonnenschein, 2007, Casella, 2005, Hortala-Vallve, 2007).
