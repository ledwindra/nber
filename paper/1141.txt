WHY

ARE REAL. INTEREST RATES SO HIGH?

Abstract

This paper applies the Capital Asset Pricing Model to help explain the
anomalous behavior of real interest rates during the last several years.

Specifically,we are able to show that the increased volatility of bond prices
since the change in Federal Reserve operating procedure in October 1979 has
substantially increased the required real risk premium on long term bonds. We
also consider and reject the possibility that increased risk alone accounts

for the recent increase in the short—term real rate. Finally, we use the
model to simulate the financial effects of a Federal debt maturity management
operation.

WHY ARE REAL INTEREST RATES SO HIGH?

The recent behavior of the real interest rate and the term structure of
nominal interest rates has been a major puzzle to most macroeconomists.
Throughout the 1970's, analysts explained the historically high nominal
interest rates as being the result of a high expected rate of inflation,
assuming that real interest rates remained at their relatively low historical

levels.1 In the early 1980's, however, the expected real short—term
irterest rate apparently rose, as the nominal short—term rate remained high

while the inflation rate declined.2 The behavior of the real long-term
interest rate has been less clear, since there is no accepted measure of

long—term expected inflation. Many analysts argued that the long-term nominal
interest rate was high In the early 1980's because the long-term expected

inflation rate was high.3 However, we argue in this paper that a
significant portion of the rise in long-term nominal interest rates (see

Figure 1) was due to an increase in the real risk premium on long-term bonds,
apparently resulting from the Increased volatility of interest rates since the
change in Federa' Reserve operating procedure in October, 1979.

The theoretical model we employ is a modified version of the capital asset
pricing model (CAPM), which has become the standard financial model of capital

market equilibrium over the past decade, but which to our knowledge has not
been employed to explain macroeconomic phenomena of the sort investigated

here. Standard macroeconomic models have been employed to explain the rise in
the short-term real interest rate since October, 1979. These models, for
example the IS—LM model, typically do not account for the possibility that

2
changes in the return variability on bonds can affect the short-term real

rate, and do not explain shifts in the term structure of interest rates. Our
empirical results, using the CAPM, indicate that our model by itself cannot
account for the recent high real rates of return on short-term nominal bonds,

though It does explain higher long term rates quite well. Thus, our model
explains the seeming anomaly of the flat nominal term structure observed in
the early 1980's despite a reduction in the expected future inflation rate.
The use in this paper of the CAPM to forecast the term structure of real

risk premia on bonds stands in sharp contrast to more usual methods of

explaining the term structure. For example, the expectations hypothesis
implies that high long—term yields could be explained only by high expected

future short-term yields. The inconsistency between the expectations
hypothesis and modern financial theory has been noted (e.g., see Cox,

Ingersoll, and Ross, 1981). What appears not to be widely appreciated,
however, is that whatever the structural explanation of the term structure,
expected rates of return on bonds should obey an equilibrium asset pricing
relationship such as the CAPM.

Our model aso permits us to explore another issue in macroeconomics,
namely how the maturity composition of the outstanding government debt affects
relative yields on short and long—term debt and, more importantly, the

required return on equity. Since Tobin's (1963) paper on debt management,
this has been a central concern of monetary theorists and policy makers.

Using our model, we are able to quantify the effects on yield spreads of
shifts in the relative supplies of short-term vs. long—term government debt.

Friedman (1982) and Roley (1982) have examined this issue using a different

methodology: empirically estimated structural demand and supply equations for

—3—

different assets. Our methodology, using an equilibrium pricing relationship,
is quite different from theirs.4

The structure of the paper is as follows: in the first section, we
briefly

explain the theoretical model and its two main implications for

equilibrium risk premia. In Section 2, we explain how we estimated the inputs
necessary to derive numerical values for the equilibrium risk premia from our
model. Section 3 presents the estimated risk premia and shows how their
behavior has evolved over time. We also consider the sensitivity of our
estimates to several of our key assumptions about aggregate risk aversion and

the stochastic process generating real returns. Finally, in Section 4 we
explore the model's implications for the conduct of debt-management policy.

In particular, we show how changes in the relative supplies of short and
long—term government debt can affect the equilibrium risk premium on equity,

thus influencing the rate of capital formation in the economy. An appendix
discusses the construction of the data.

Theoretical

Model

A. Determining the Risk Premia on Assets
Our basic model of portfolio selection is that of Markowitz (1952) as
developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1964), and Mossin (1966), and extended to

a full intertemporal context by Merton (1969, 1971). Merton has shown that
when asset prices follow a Geometric Brownian Motion in continuous time and
portfolios can be continuously revised, then as in the original Markowitz

model, only variances and covariances of the joint distribution of returns are

needed to compute equilibrium risk premia. Investors are assumed to have
homogeneous expectations about the values of these parameters.

we assume that all n assets are continuously and costlessly traded and that

there are no taxes.5 In this context It is straightforward to show that the

real risk premium on asset i relative to asset j, R -

must

in

equilibrium be given by6
R1 —

aM)

(1)

Covariance between the real rate of return on asset i and the
real rate of return on the market portfolio

=

Harmonic mean of investors' degree of relative risk
aversion, weighted by investors' share of aggregate wealth.

Equation (1) holds for real rates of return whether or not there is a
risk—free asset, and whether or not there is inflation; in this paper, we will

be assuming there is no real risk—free asset. By choosing R appropriately,
it Is

possible

to derive the various versions of the CAPM-type asset pricing

relationships, such as the standard CAPM when there is a risk-free asset, and

the Black (1972) "zero-beta" version when there is not. Because the focus in
this paper is on explaining risk premla on bonds, we will use the rate of
return on Treasury bills as our benchmark asset.

In the standard version of the CAPM, the measure of aggregate relative

risk aversion, ,

is

eliminated in order to write the equilibrium pricing

relationship solely in terms of (presumably) observable variables, such as

beta and the risk premium on the market portfolio. In this paper, we are
interested In

explaining

risk premia, so we leave the equation in the form

(1). Our strategy Is to estimate the necessary covariances and to compute

risk premia for various levels of risk aversion. To our knowledge, no one has
seriously

suggested that the average level of relative risk aversion is below

one or above six, so

we

restrict our calculations to that range.7

—5—

In standard discussions of the 'APM, the "market portfolio" is usually

taken to mean a portfolio of equities. In this paper, we take as the market
portfolio the total quantity of stocks and bonds which must be held. In
theory, the market portfolio should represent the total quantity of claims
which must be held by the household sector, so that our measure is preferable
to using equities alone.
It should be emphasized that equation (1) does not give yields to
maturity; rather, equation (1) gives the expected instantaneous holding period

yield for any asset. This distinction is especially crucial for bonds, since
a long term bond with an expected holding period yield appropriate for
long—term bonds, will someday become a short-term bond with a different

expected holding period yield. The expected yield to maturity will be an
average of future expected holding period yields. For the purposes of this
paper, the important point is that, ceteris paribus, an increase in the

expected

to

holding period yield on a long—term asset will also raise its yield

maturity.

B. The Shadow Risk-Free Rate
Given the equilibrium pricing relationship (1), it is possible to ask

the following question: if a risk-free asset were introduced in zero
aggregate
risk

have to have if equilibrium

premia were to remain undisturbed? We call

risk-free

would

supply, what rate of return would it

this rate the shadow

rate.8 From (1), it is easy to see that

the shadow risk-free rate

satisfy
R0

-

Rf

=

OM

(2)

where R0 is the expected rate of return on zero—duration assets (Treasury

—6—

bills), and OM is the covariance between Treasury bills and the Market. As
long as this covariance is unchanged, the risk premium on Treasury bills over
the shadow risk—free rate will not change.

One reason for focusing on the shadow risk—free rate is the possibility
that it remains relatively constant over time, and thus serves to tie down the

absolute level of interest rates over time and not just the risk premia. In a
consumption—based asset pricing model (see, for example, Cox, Ingersoll, and
Ross, 1978), the shadow risk—free rate would depend on the rate of time
preference and the expected rate of change in the marginal utility of

consumption. Policy changes which changed neither of these would leave the
shadow risk—free rate constant. One should think of the shadow risk—free rate
as the rate that would prevail if the risk—free asset was in zero net supply.
The more risk-averse investors would lend to the more risk-tolerant investors,
and those with average risk aversion would hold none of the risk-free asset.

It. The Data

In this section we describe in some detail how we estimated covariances

and market weights. It should be emphasized that the goal is not to test the
CAPM, but instead to derive Its implications for the change in risk premia due
to the change in asset return variability over the last several years.

A. Assets Included
Obviously It is necessary to limit the number of assets studied. We
assumed that there were ten classes of assets: stocks; Treasury-bills; and
nominally risk—free bonds, of durations one through eight years. In measuring
how long—term a particular debt issue Is, we are careful throughout the paper

—7—

to use duration instead of the more common measure of maturity date.9
Duration is a measure of the time until the average payment to the bondholder
occurs, and may be used to consistently compare bonds with very different
payment streams, for which maturity date may provide a misleading comparison.

The distinction between maturity and duration Is important since the duration
of bonds of a given maturity shortened considerably In the late 1970's.

Stocks are an obvious choice for inclusion, and we include a variety of
bonds because it is bond yields we are interested In explaining. Some of the

exclusions, however, are noteworthy: land, residential housing, and consumer
durables together account for about 40 percent of household net worth as

measured In the Flow—of-Funds Sector Balance Sheets. Unfortunately, there are
no reliable rate of return series for these assets, so we were forced to

exclude them from our market portfolIo. Human capital Is excluded for the
same reason.

There are also a variety of assets which are not literally common stock or
governments bonds, but which we assume are good substitutes for those assets.

Time and Demand deposits, for example, are taken to have the same rate of
return as Treasury bills10; corporate bonds and municipal bonds are assumed
to be "like" government bonds; and non—corporate equity Is assumed to have the

same characteristics as equity. We decided that these assumptions (and others
to be outlined below) were preferable to ignoring these assets. We could not
separately

include these other assets because acceptable rate of return data

could not be obtained.

-8B.

Real Rates of Return

We estimated covariances using monthly real rates of return for stocks

and the nine categories of government bonds described above. We used monthly
data because, as Merton (1980) has shown, the accuracy of variance and
covariance estimates is improved by using frequent observation periods, and
because one month is the shortest interval for which inflation data is
available and hence for which real rates of return could be computed.

Estimates of the mean, on the other hand, are not improved by Increasing the

observation frequency within a given time span. The price index used was the
Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index, excluding the cost of
shelter.

Real returns on Treasury Bills are from Ibbotson and Sinquefield (198),
while bond data are from the U.S. Government bond-file of the Center for

Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Stock returns are from the NYSE monthly
CRSP file. We divided the bonds into nine categories based on duration.
In all cases the rate of return was measured as the natural logarithm of

the monthly real wealth relatives. On the assumption that these returns are
lognormally distributed, the log of the wealth relative over a discrete time

interval Is

normally

distributed with mean

and variance a, where

reported means were converted to annual rates by multiplying them by 1

and the standard deviations by multiplying them by /12. This makes them
comparable to the means and standard deviations of the continuously compounded
rates

of return one would obtain using a one year holding period.

-9-

C. Market Weights
As mentioned, the market portfolio consists of a number

of

different

assets. In order to compute the covariance of the return on the market with
that on other assets, it is necessary to know the composition of the market

portfolio (the market weights), which we denote wM. Theoretically, WM
should measure the percentage of household net worth invested in assets which

comprise the market portfolio. We used the Flow-of-Funds Sector Balance
Sheets to obtain this breakdown for broad categories of assets for 1976 and

1980. The Treasury Department's Monthly Statement of the Public Debt was used
to determine the relative quantities of government bonds of different

maturities outstanding In those two years. We assume in the calculations that
government bonds are net worth to the household sector. The details of the
procedure for determining the weights is relegated to an appendix.
Weights were computed by calculating the percentage of household net worth
(taken from the Flow of Funds Balance Sheet) held in each kind of asset, under

two alternative assumptions about financial intermediaries: first, that the
liabilities of intermediaries are treated as assets by the household sector;

and second, that financial intermediaries are a veil, so that households
perceive themselves as directly holding the assets of intermediaries.

Intermediaries are completely netted out in the second procedure. The chief
difference in the two cases is that households hold more short—term assets In

the first case. This Is to be expected, since intermediaries typically borrow
short and lend long. Weights computed under the two assumptions are presented
in the Appendix.

There is one important class of assets held by households for which

duration data is not available: pension fund and life insurance reserves.

-10-

Together, these constitute almost one-fifth of the financial net worth of
households in both 1976 and 1980. Consequently our results are potentially

sensitive to the allocation of these assets across durations. We elected to
compute asset weights under each of two assumptions about these assets:
first, that they were spread evenly across durations one through eight (we
also used this assumption to allocate mortgages across durations); and second,

that these reserves are predominantly long term. In the second case, we used
the sum—of-the-years digits method to allocate these assets "triangularly"

across durations. The second case is probably

more reasonable, since for

households pension reserves represent a long-term, nominally fixed claim.
Nevertheless,

we computed results under both sets of assumptions.

0. Computing Rate of Return Covariances
The most important input to the model is the covariance matrix of

asset returns. In order to estimate a covariance matrix, it is necessary to
create a time—series of residuals-—deviations of actual rates of return from

some mean or expected rate of return. We estimated covariances by computing
the mean in two different ways:

1. Unconditional Covariance. Here we simply computed the covariance
matrix of asset returns by taking deviations of actual rates of return from

the historical mean rate of return over the same period. This is
objectionable only If the conditional expected mean real rate of return
changed

2.

(or was perceived to have changed) over the period in question.

Conditional Covariance. In this procedure, we allowed for a

time—varying expected rate of return for each asset and computed deviations

from this mean in estimating the covariance matrix. To do this, we performed

—11—

the following procedure: an expected real rate of return on one-month
Treasury bills was computed in one of several ways (see below), and this
process was used to generate a one-month ahead expected real rate of return on

Treasury bills. Given this forecast of R0, and the covariance matrix
estimated over the previous twenty—four months, it was possible to estimate

the expected rate of return on every asset using (1). With both the expected
rate of return on every asset and the actual return, we were able to compute
forecast

errors. The latest forecast error (conditional on the forecast of

the Treasury bill rate) was then entered into the data matrix and used the
next period in computing the covarlance matrix.

Thus, the entries in the conditional covariance matrix were computed as

4

1,T-t - R.1 ,T-t )(.3 ,T—t -R.j ,T—t )

(3)

where R represents the realized real rate of return and R is the estimated
expected real rate of return, computed using equation (1.) and the previous
months covariance estimate.
An important advantage of this procedure is that the computed expected

rates of return for each period are consistent with the model. The only part
of this procedure which is ad hoc is the specification of the process

generating expected rates of return on Treasury bills. The measure of
covariance upon which

rate

the CAPM is based is the covariance of holding period

of return deviations from expected rates of return. This Is

precisely

what our procedure measures.

An obvious alternative way to compute the conditional covariance would be
to calculate an expected rate of return based on a rolling ARIMA regression,

or using some other kind of forecasting procedure. However, under the null

—12—

hypothesis that the CAPM correctly describes asset market equilibrium, the
ARIMA regression would likely fall to generate true expected rates of return,

since It ignores the relationship between the covariance structure and
expected rates of return.

We computed expected real rates of return on Treasury bills using four
different methods:

a) R0 =

I

-

w1.

The expected real yield over the coming month is

the current nominal yield on a 30—day Treasury bill, i, less last monthts
inflation rate, ri.

b) R0 =

a +

bR0

.

The expected real yield on Treasury bills

follows an AR1 process. We experimented with computing a and b in three
different ways: a and b were reestimated every period using only the last 24
months of data, and using all available data; and they were constrained to be
the numbers reported in Ibbotson and Slnquefield (1982), i.e., a =

0,

b =

.63.

take this to demonstrate the point made above, that the mean cannot reliably
be estimated over a relatively short span of time, and that the use of the ex
post mean to estimate the ex ante mean would be futile over this time period.

Instead, we use the covariance data to infer the pattern of expected risk
premia across assets.

Comparing the two sample periods, it is apparent that the standard
deviation on stocks and bills changed little between 1973—1979 and 1980—1981.

The change in rate of return standard deviations on long-term bonds is
dramatic, however, with the standard deviations on the longest-term bonds
increasing four-fold, and exceeding the standard deviation on the rate of
return on equity.

The pattern of correlation coefficients is especially important for our
purposes, since we wish to examine the effect of Government debt management

policies on relative asset yields. The sign and strength of correlations
determines the relative substitutability of assets. For example, if the
covariance between the rate of return on equity and duration 8 bonds is large,
then an increase In the supply of duration 8 bonds would be expected to
increase the yields on both duration 8 bonds and equity, while if the

covariance is low, the effect on equity would be less pronounced.
The pattern of correlation coefficients in Table la does not seem to
suggest that long-term bonds are more like bills than like equity, which was

argued by Tobin (1963). Between the earlier and later periods, bills and
stocks became essentially uncorrelated, while the correlation of stocks with

the longer duration bonds rose, and that for shorter duration bonds fell. It
is worth noting that covariances between the longer duration bonds and stocks
did in general increase from the earlier to the later sample period, since

both standard deviations and correlations increased. Thus the importance of
debt management policy should be greater in the later than in the earlier
period.

-14-

The covariance matrix was then used to compute risk premia, using equation
(1).

The level of risk aversion, , was set at 1, 3.5, and 6, to represent

extreme plausible values of the level of aggregate risk aversion.

Because the

risk premium is proportional to the level of risk aversion, it is easy to
compute the result of a change in this parameter.

In Table 2 we present the

results using 1980 market weights, computed under the assumption that pension
fund and life insurance reserves are predominantly long-term assets.

The results are striking: the increase in the variability of rates of
return on long-term assets from the seventies to the eighties raised the risk

premium on long—term nominal bonds by a minimum of 110 basis points, and
possibly by over 700 basis points, depending on aggregate risk aversion.
Thus, the puzzle of the flat term structure In 1980 and 1981 may not be a

puzzle at all. It is entirely possible that the Fed's restrictive action
lowered expected future long—term inflation rates, and that the short-term

interest rate rose for standard IS—LM reasons. The seeming anomaly that
long-term interest rates also rose, may be explained by a rise in the real
risk premium, which more than offset the decline in the long-term inflation
premi urn.

Table

2 also shows that changes in covariances alone cannot explain the

rise in the real short-term interest rate in the early 1980's. The risk
premium for duration zero bonds relative to the shadow risk—free rate
bottom

row in

Table

2)

actually fell from 1973—79 to

(the

1980-81, and was less

in the
than 25 basis points in both subperiods. This suggests that changes

is not equipped to do.

B. Conditional Covariances

A possible objection to the use of unconditional covariance estimates
to infer risk premia is that the levels of expected rates of return are

changing

over time. In this case, estimating unconditional covariances can

give misleading results. To account for this possibility, we estimated

conditional covariances as described above, using four different methods for

calculating
All

of the different methods for computing conditional covariances gave

virtually identical results, so we report only those in which the expected
real

rate.

is clear that the conditional covariance estimates are virtually identical
the

unconditional covariance estimates; the patterns

coefficients

to

of correlation

and standard deviations are similar.

Because the conditional and unconditional covariances are similar, the
forecasted real risk premla are similar in the two cases. Figures 2a and 2b
perform the same kind of simulation as in Table 2. They present a time series
of the risk premia (relative to Treasury bills) on duration 4 and duration 8

bonds. For both bonds, the risk premium shows a dramatic increase in 1980,
demonstrating that at least some of the increase in nominal long-term yields

was due to an increase in the required real rate of return. This risk premium

-16..

is

computed monthly, using the covariance matrix estimated from the previous

24 months of data. Aggregate risk aversion is

set

at 3.5.

This method of generating real risk premia can be criticized on the
grounds that the measured covariance lags behind the true expected covariance;
the

expected covariance matrix in November, 1979, was probably not equal to

the measured covariance matrix for the previous 24 months. Nevertheless, it
is notable how quickly the risk premia in Figure 2 rise following October,
1979.

The gaps in the graphs (dotted lines) are the result of missing data.
Very long-term government bonds did not exist for some time periods in the
early and mid 1970's, so we simply omitted those periods, instead of
arbitrarily assigning the market weights from missing bonds to other

bonds.t1 When there were gaps, the covariance matrix was computed using the
last 24 months for which a full data set was available. The expected real
rate on Treasury bills, on the other hand, was always computed using the most
recent data.

C. Sensitivity Analysis
The market weights used in the computations are at best rough

approximations; consequently, it is important to know the sensitivity to

changes in the market weights of the estimated risk premia. Table 3 contains
risk premia estimated under two alternative assumptions about weights. All
risk premia are computed under the assumption that the coefficient of relative
risk aversion is 3.5.

Column 2 of Table 3 contains risk premia estimated using weights
constructed under the assumption that financial intermediaries are a veil.

This results in a large redistribution of the weights from short to long—term

assets, while keeping the weight on equity at the same level. While the risk
premium

on long—term bonds rises appreciably, the overall pattern and levels

of risk premia remain much the same. This is also true for the risk premia
presented in the third column, which uses the set of weights which most
differed from the weights in Column 1, and which assumed intermediaries not to
be a veil.

It is clear that the risk premium on equity is not particularly sensitive

to the pattern of weights across bonds. An increase in the market weights
assigned to long—term bonds, however, can appreciably raise the required rate

of return on long—term bonds. For our purpose, which Is examining the effect
of covariance changes on risk premia, the pattern of risk premia appears
sufficiently unaffected by small changes in the weights that it is unnecessary
to worry about the exact assumptions used in constructing the weights or about
variations In the weights over time.

4. Debt Management and Relative Risk Premia
An important strand in macroeconomic thought for the last 20 years has
been the importance of government financing and monetary policy as
determinants of relative rates of return on assets, and hence of real

activity. This idea, due to Tobin (1964), stresses the myriad possible
outcomes from various combinations of debt management policy and monetary

management. The model In this paper actually provides a way to quantify the
possible effect of alternative government debt policies on relative rates of

return. There may be offsetting effects, however, so that the estimates

obtained

in this way should he thought of as maximum possible effects.

-18-

Before examining Table 4, which contains the results of a simple
experiment in which the Treasury shifts the composition of debt towards
long-term debt, we should examine the extent to which the government can

actually affect the market weights. At the most (when financial
intermediaries are considered a veil), government debt (excluding agency
securities) constitutes about nine percent of household financial net worth.

About a quarter of this is short—term government debt. Thus, if the Federal
government were to replace all short—term debt with long-term debt, a shift of

two percent would occur from short- to long—term bond weights. As we have
already seen, a change of this magnitude will not change risk premia

significantly. The government has other tools at its disposal, however, since
it regulates financial institutions. Thus, by exerting regulatory pressure,
it might be possible to reduce the percentage of short—term debt still further.
Table 4 shows the results of a maturity change in which the government
increases the percentage of duration zero debt by 5 percentage points, and

reduces the percentage in durations 3 through 8.12 Even for this rather
large change in the weights, the risk premium on equity is reduced by only

fifteen basis points. The risk premium on the very longest-term debt is
reduced somewhat more, by almost fifty basis points.

Some care is required in interpreting the results in Table 4. As Tobin
(1963) emphasized, it is the risk premium on equity which matters for capital

formation. The correct risk premium, however, is that on unlevered equity,
while the risk premium we have actually measured is that on levered equity.
To measure the effect of a government maturity change on the risk premium of

unlevered equity, one must unlever the number in Table 4. This can be done by
computing a weighted average of the risk premia in Table 4, where the weights

This weighted average approximates the unlevered cost of equity capital.

all of the risk premia in Table 4

Because
risk

fell, it is clear that the required

premium on unlevered equity would also have fallen.
Friedman (1981) and Roley (1982) have also studied the effects of a

federal debt management operation on relative security yields. They both
conclude that much smaller Federal debt management operations than those

considered

here would affect relative yields by roughly the same order of

magnitude as in our simulation.
and

An important difference between their models

ours, however, is that we assume that investors immediately adjust their

portfolio

composition in response to the change in relative yields, while

Friedman and Roley both use a model In which adjustment takes time. To some

extent,

therefore, their results measure transient impact effects (which are

greater than the long-run relative price changes) and thus are not directly
comparable to our results.

This analysis is valid even though it ignores the difference between
interest-bearing and non—interest bearing debt, which is of course at the

heart of any theory of monetary policy. Our framework is partial equilibrium,
taking the level of the Treasury bill rate as given. Monetary policy should
be thought of as shifting the

relative

general level of interest rates up or down. The

pattern of risk premia should not be affected, however, except to the

extent that a change in monetary policy changes the pattern of covariances, as

it appears to have in 1979. The model in

this paper can really say nothing

about the effects of monetary policy per Se, though it can be used to analyze

the

effects of debt management.

-20-

Having discussed what the government can in principle do, It is worth

noting that the government may not be able to have much effect. One
argument-—due to Barro (1974)-—is simply that if households capitalize future
tax liabilties, then a change in the risk composition of assets that
households must hold (due to a change in the maturity structure of outstanding
government debt) would simply be offset by a change in the risk composition of

future tax liabilities. There are a number of reasons for finding this
argument unconvincing, which are detailed in Tobin (1980).

5. Summary and Conclusions
This paper has applied financial theory to help explain the anomalous

interest rate behavior of the last several years. A number of commentators
have been surprised that nominal long-term interest rates remained high even

when expected future inflation rates were thought to have declined. Our
explanation is that even if expected future inflation rates did decline, the
high long—term nominal yields can be explained as the result of increased real

risk premia. We are able to show that for long—term bonds, the increased
variance of the rate of return on long-term bonds and the increased
correlation with other assets, should have induced a rise in the real risk
premium on long—term bonds between 1973—1979 and 1980—1981.

While our model is able to account for an upward—sloping term structure of
real expected rates of return, it is unable to account for the rise in the

real rate of return on short—term bonds. We are able to show that the risk
premium on bills relative to the shadow risk—free rate should not have
increased in the 1980's, since the covariance between bills and the market
changed little.

—21-

Our model also provides a novel way to analyze the effects of a

debt-management operation, such as "Operation Twist." Instead of estimating a
supply and demand equations for different assets, we simply use the CAPM,

which is an equilibrium pricing relationship, to explore the effects of
changes in the relative supplies of different assets.
We

used only the one-factor CAPM in this paper; an obvious next step would

be the use of a consumption based asset—pricing model, as in Breeden

to

(1979),

compute risk premia. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons the

consumption—based approach is more difficult to implement, so we did not
attempt it in this paper.

The market weights were then computed under two alternative assumptions

about financial intermediaries: that the liabilities of financial
intermediaries are treated as assets by the household sector, and that
financial intermediaries are a "veil,0 so that households behaved as if they

directly held the assets of intermediaries. The first is more coherent under
the finance paradigm; nevertheless we computed both sets of weights as a

sensitivity check. Notice that the biggest difference between the two
computations is in the percentage of duration zero bonds held by households.
Under the intermediaries—a—veil assumption, there are no financial

institutions to perform the function of transforming long—term assets into

short-term liabilities. Households hold no demand or time deposits, with the
result that they Instead directly hold assets such as mortgages. The
aggregate debt-equity ratio is insensitive to the assumption that
intermedtaries are a veil, because financial institutions hold debt and are

predominantly debt—financed. Tables A—2 and A—3 contain the results of both
computations.

security price changes.
5.

The assumption that there are no taxes does not appear to be important
for our qualitative results but can affect the magnitude of the risk

premium, depending on the assets being compared. There are two problems,
one relating to means, the other to covariances. To convert the risk
premia to the difference in nominal before—tax expected yields, it is
necessary only to divide the risk premium by one minus the tax rate if

both assets are taxed at the same rate. In this case, the reported risk
premia understate the before—tax nominal risk premia. If the two assets
are taxed at different rates (as with stocks and bonds) it is necessary
to know rate of return levels and not just risk premia in order to infer
the difference in before-tax nominal yields.

The covariance correction is more involved. For 30-day bills, the
conditional

real rate of return variance is unaffected by taxes since the

-28-

nominal after-tax rate of return is certain, and the real rate of return

is obtained by subtracting the stochastic inflation rate. For stocks and
long-term bonds, there is uncertainty about the nominal yield, and hence

about the part of the return which will be taxed. It is then necessary
to adjust the covariance for the reduction in the real return variance

due to taxes. (The deviation of actual from expected nominal returns
will typically be taxed at the capital gains rate, at least to a first

approximation.) The net effect of making all the adjustments is
ambiguous.
6.

It is shown in Bodie, Kane, and Mcflonald (1983) that the equilibrium

expected rate of return on any asset may be written
2

R1 = Rmin

where

6'iM — amln

is a measure of aggregate risk aversion, aIM is the covariance

of the real rate of return on asset i with that of the market, and rmjn
and

are the expected rate of return and the variance of the

rate of return on the minimum variance portfolio. This relationship
implies (1).
7.

Friend and Blume (1975) estimate tS

to

be 2, while Friend and Hasbrouck

obtain an estimate of 6. Grossman and Shiller (1981), using a different
method, obtain an estimate of 4.
8.

What we call the "shadow risk-free rate" Is also the rate of return on

the zero—beta portfolio in the Black (1972) version of the CAPM. Using
arguments along the lines of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1978), ft is

straightforward to show that in a model with one state variable and no
risk-free asset, the zero beta portfolio has a rate of return equal to
the rate of time preference, less the expected percentage change in the
marginal utility of consumption.

—29—

It is also shown in Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1978), and in Lintner

(1969) that the shadow risk—free rate equals the Lagrange multiplier
associated with the wealth constraint in the portfolio maximization
problem.

A possible reason for the non-existence of indexed bonds is
discussed in Bodie, Kane and McDonald (1983), where it is shown that the
welfare gain from introducing such an asset would be small.
9.

Duration, as defined by Macaulay (1938) is a weighted average of the

years to maturity of each of the cash flows from a security. The weights
are the present value of each year's cash flow as a proportion of the
total

in

present value of the security. Duration equals final maturity only

the case of pure discount bonds. For coupon bonds and mortgages,

duration is always less than maturity. The difference between maturity
and duration for ordinary coupon bonds and mortgages is greater the

longer

the final maturity and the higher the level of interest rates. In

our sample of bonds this difference rose steadily over the 1953-1981
period

due to the rising trend In interest rates. The most pronounced

differences were in the 8 year duration category. In 1953 the average
maturity of the bonds in our 8 year duration portfolio was just under 9
years whereas in 1981 the average maturity of the 8 year duration

portfolio was 23 years. This variation over the last 30 years calls into
question the appropriateness of a bond return series with a constant
maturity of 20 years, such as the one tabulated by Ibbotson and
Slnquefiel d (1982).

10. Currency and bank deposits are taken to have a non—measurable "service
yield" over and above their explicit, nominally—fixed rate of return.

11. Other long-term nominally fixed securities such as corporate bonds and
mortgages did exist over these periods, so simply setting the long—term
market weights to zero would have been inappropriate.
Ibbotson and Sinquefield use flower bonds in constructing their rate

of return series for long—term government bonds. We exclude them,
however, on the grounds that their true maturity is likely to be much
shorter than the stated maturity.

12. The weights on duration 3 and 4 bonds are set to zero, and those for
durations 5 through 8 are reduced by one percentage point.
