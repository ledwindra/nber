Do Stock Prices Move too Much to be Justified
by Subsequent Changes in Dividends?
ABSTRACT

An ex-post rational real common stock price series, formed as

the present value of subpequent detrended real

diY~dend~, ~~ ~ound

to be a very stable and smooth series when compared with the actual
detrended real stock price series.

An efficient markets model which

makes price the optimal forecast of the ex-post rational price is
inconsistent with this data if the long-run trend of real dividends
is assumed given.

To reconcile the data with the efficient markets

model, one must assume that the market expected real dividends deviate
from their long-run trend much more than they did historically.

Introduction and Basic Concepts

,

A simple model that is commonly used to intjrpret movements in corporate
common stock price indexes asserts that real stock prices equal the present
value of rationally expected or optimally forecasted future real dividends
discounted by a constant real discount rate.

This valuation model (or va 4 iations

on it in which the real discount rate is not constant but fairly stable) is
often used by economists and market analysts alike as a plausible model to
describe the behavior of aggregate market indexes and is viewed as providing
a reasonable story to tell when people ask what accounts for a sudden movement
in stock price indexes.
about future dividends.

Such movements are than attributed to "new information"
I will refer to this model as the "efficient markets

model" although it should be recognized that this name has also been applied
to other models.
It has often been objected in popular discussions that stock price indexes
are too "volatile", Le., that the movements in stock price indexes could not
realistically be attributed to any objective new information, since movements
'in the indexes are "too big" relative to actual subsequent-movements in dividends.
To illustrate graphically why it seems that this is so, I have plotted in
figure 1 a stock price index Pt with its ex-post rational counterpart P~ (data
set l).!/

The stock price index Pt is the detrended real Standard & Poor's

Composite Stock Price Index, and

th~

P~

is the present discounted value of

actual subsequent detrended real dividends.

The analogous 'series for a

modified Dow Jones Industrial Average appear in figure 2 (data set 2).

One is

struck by the smootnness and stability of the ex-post rational price series p*
t

when compared with the actual price series.

This behavior of p* is due to the

fact that the present value relation relates p* to a long weighted moving
average of dividends, and moving averages tend to smooth the series averaged. ,While

far enough to cause major movements in p*.

For example, while one normally thinks

of the great depression as a time when business was bad, real dividends were
substantially below trend (i.e., 10-25% below trend for the Standard & Poor
series, 16-38% below trend for the Dow Series) only for a few years:
1935 and 1938.

1933, 1934

Clearly the stock market decline beginning in 1929 and ending

in 1932 could not be rationalized in terms of subsequent dividends!

Nor could

it be rationalized in terms of subsequent earnings, since earnings are relevant
in this model only as indicators of later dividends.

markets model does not say p

Of course, the efficient

Might one still suppose that this kind of

stock market crash was a rational mistake, a forecast error that rational
people might make?

This paper will explore the notion that the very

volatility of p (i.e., the tendency of big movements in p to occur again and
again) implies that the answer is no.
To give an idea of the kind of volatility comparisons that will be made
here, let us consider at this point the simplest inequality which puts limits
on one measure of volatility:

the standard deviation of p.

that the forecast could be improved.

This paper will develop the efficient markets model in section II below
to clarify some theoretical questions that may arise in connection with the
inequality (1) and some similar inequalities will be derived that put limits
on the standard deviation of the innovation in price and the standard deviation
of the change in price.

The model is restated in innovation form which allows

better understanding of the limits on stock price volatility imposed by the
model.

In particular, this will enable us to see (section III) that the

standard deviation of f'.Pt is highest when information about dividends is
revealed smoothly, and that if information is revealed in big lumps occasionally
the price series may have higher kurtosis (fatter tails) but will have lower
variance.

The notion expressed by some that earnings rather than dividend data

should be used is discussed in section IV, and a way of assessing the importance
of time variation in real discount rates is shown in section V.

The inequalities

are compared with the data in section VI.
This paper takes as its starting ;aint an approach qeve10ped earlier (Shiller
[197~) which showed that long-term bond yields are too volatile to accord with

representation is used.
LeRoy and Porter [1979} have independently derived some restrictions on
security price volatility implied by the efficient markets model and concluded
that common stock prices are too volatile to accord with the model.

The approach

in this paper, however, while it has benefited from their work is actually quite
different from theirs.

Some different characterizations of volatility are examined

post-war data are employed.

I do not attempt Box-Jenkins [1970J modelling of the

On the other hand, some indication is given here of how much expected real

rates would have to move to explain the volatility.
It may appear that this paper is attempting to contradict the extensive
literature of efficient markets (for example, as in Cootner [1964], or surveyed
in Fama [1970J).

1/

This appearance is somewhat deceptive, since most of this

literature really examines different properties of security prices, and in fact
there is no agreement on an operational definition of the term "efficient markets".
Very little of the efficient markets literature bears directly on the characteristic
feature of our model:

that expected real returns for the aggregate stock market

are constant through time (or approximately so).

~/

Much of the literature on

efficient markets concerns the investigation of nominal "profit opportunities"
(variously defined) and whether transa2tions costs prohibit their exploitation.
Of course, if real stock prices are "too volatile" as it is defined here, then
there may well be a sort of real profit opportunity.

Time variation in

expected real interest rates does not itself imply that any trading rule

-5-

dominates a buy and hold strategy, but really large variations in expected returns
might seem to suggest that such a trading rule exists.

This paper does not

investigate this, or whether transactions costs prohibit its exploration.

This

paper is concerned, however, instead with a more interesting (from an economic
standpoint) question:

what accounts for movements in real stock prices and can they

be explained by "new information" about subsequent real dividends?

If the

model fails due to excessive volatility, then we will have seen a new characterization of how the simple model fails.

The characterization is not equivalent to

other characterizations of its failure, such as that one period holding
returns are forecastable or that stocks have not been good inflation hedges
recently.
The volatility comparisons that we will make have the advantage that they
are insensitive to misalignment of price and dividend series, as may happen
with earlier data when collection procedures were not ideal.

The tests are also

not affected by the practice, in the construction of stock price and dividend
indexes, of dropping certain stocks from the sample occasionally and replacing
them with other stocks, so long as the volatility of the series is not misstated.
These comparisons are thus well suited to existing long-term data in stock price
averages.

The robustness that the volatility comparisons have, coupled with

their simplicity, may account for their popularity in casual discourse.

chosen has a negligible weight in the determination of

If we had chosen

a different terminal condition the result would be to add or subtract an
exponential trend from the p* shown in figure 1.

This is shown graphically

in figure 3, in which p* is shown computed from alternative terminal values.
Since the only thing we need know to compute p* about dividends after 1978 is

p* for 1979 it does not matter whether dividends are "smooth" or not after 1978.
Thus, figure 3 summarizes our uncertainty about p*.
There is yet another way to write the model, which will be useful in the
analysis which follows.

This means that, if one looks at a time series
one sees long stretches of time when their

an infrequent large (absolute) value.

This phenomenon is commonly attributed to a tendency for new information to
come in big lumps infrequently.

There seems to be a common presumption that

this information lumping might cause stock price changes to have high or
infinite variance, which would seem to contradict our conclusion in the preceding
section that the variance of price is limited and is maximized if forecasts

IV.

Dividends or Earnings?
In the model (2) earnings may be relevant to the pricing of shares but only

-15-

insofar as earnings are indicators of future dividends.

Earnings are thus no

different from any other economic variable which may indicate future dividends.
Earnings are statistics conceived by accountants which are supposed to provide
an indicator of how well a company is doing.

Unfortunately, there is a

great deal of latitude for the definition of earnings, as the recent literature
on inflation accounting will attest.

Historically, earnings appear inaccurate

and overstated in that retained earnings appear to earn far less than the discount
rate and are a poor indicator of future dividends, as noted by Cowles [1938],
Little [1962J and Baumol, Heim, Malkiel and Quandt [1970].
There is no reason why price per share ought to be the present value of
expected earnings per share if earnings are retained.

In fact, as Miller and

Modigliani [19611 argued, such a present value formula would entail a fundamental
sort of double counting.

It is incorrect to include in the present value

formula both earnings at time t and the later earnings that accrue when time t
earnings are reinvested. 15/

That is, however, what the present value of

earnings per share would include.

Miller and Modigliani showed a formula by

which price might be regarded as the present value of earnings corrected for
investments but that formula can be shown, using an accounting identity, identical
to (2).
Some people seem to feel that one cannot claim price as present value of
expected dividends since firms routinely payout only a fraction of earnings,and
also attempt somewhat to stabilize dividends.

That feeling apparently stems from

a careless extrapolation of the case where firms paid out no dividends or paid
constant dividends in a growing economy.

Simple growth models such as those

described in Fama and Miller [1971] in fact show that as long as the payout
fraction is non-zero, one may regard price as present value of dividends.

16/

-16-

In these models, one can always describe price as the present value of dividends
as long as the dividend retention policy doesn't cause the firm to grow at
the discount rate.

With our Standard and Poor data, the growth rate of real

price is only about 1.5%, while the discount rate is about 4.5% + 1.5%

= 6%.

At these rates, the price of the firm a few decades hence is of little concern
to investors.
The crucial thing to recognize in our context is that once we know the
terminal price and intervening dividends, we have specified all that investors
care about.

It would not make sense to define an ex-post rational price from

a terminal condition on price and using our same formula with earnings in place
of dividends.

Time Varying Real Discount Rates
If we modify the model (2) to allow real discount rates to vary without

restriction through time, then the model becomes untestable.

We do not observe

Regardless of the behavior of £t and D , there
t

will always be a discount rate series which makes (2) hold identically.

We

might ask, though, whether the movements in the real discount rate that would
be required aren't larger than we might have expected.

Or is it possible that

small movements in the current one-period discount rate coupled with new
information about such movements in future discount rates could account for
high stock price volatility?

12/

The natural extension of (2) to the case of time varying real discount
rate is:

The first term in the above expression is just the

The second term represents the effect

of movements in real discount rates.

This second term is identical to

the expression for p* in (4) except that d + is replaced by r + and the
t k

It is possible to offer a simple intuitive interpretation for this
linearization.

First note that the linearization of l/(l+r + ), demeaned,

Thus, a one percentage point increase in r + causes
t k
times one percent, or slightly less than one percent.

Note that all terms in (17) dated t+k or higher are premultiplied by l/(l+r + ).
t k

-18-

Thus, if r + is increased by one percentage point, all else constant, then all of
t k
these terms will be reduced by about y2 times 1%.

We can approximate the sum of all

these terms as yk-lE(~t)/E(rt)' E(dt)/~(rt) is the value at the beginning of time

So,we see that a 1 percentage point increase in r t + k , all

else constant, decreases p~ by about yk+lE(dtJ!E(r ), which corresponds to the
t
th

term in expression (18). There are two sources of innacuracy with this
linearization.

First, the present value of all future dividends starting with

-k-l
time t+k is not exactly Y E(dt)/E(r t ).

Second, increasing r + by one percentage

Empirical Evidence
The elements of the inequalities (1), (11) and (15) are displayed for the

two data sets @escribed in the appendix) in Table I.

In both data sets, the

trend was estimated by regressing In(Pt) on a constant and time and then setting
A in (3) equal to e

b

where b is the coefficient of time.

The detrended real

series were then multiplied by a scale factor chosen so that p for 1979 equalled
the nominal value of the index for that date.

price.

With data set 1 the series are the real Standard & Poor's Composite Stock
Price Index and the associated real dividend series.

The earlier observations

for this series are due to Cowles [1938J who said that the index is "intended
to represent, ignoring the elements of brokerage charges and taxes, what would
have happened to an investor's funds if he had bought, at the beginning of

1871, all stocks quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, allocating his purchases
among the individual stocks in proportion to their total monetary value and
each month up to 1937 had by the same criterion redistributed his holdings
among all quoted stocks" <[19381, p.2).

In updating his series, Standard & Poor

later restricted the sample to 500 stocks, but the series continues to be
value weighted.

The advantage to this series is its comprehensiveness.

The

disadvantage is that the dividends accruing to the portfolio at one point of
time may not correspond to the dividends forecasted by holders of the Standard

& Poor's portfolio at an earlier time, due to the change in weighting of the
stocks.

There is no way to correct this disadvantage without losing comprehensiveness.

The original portfolio of 1871 is bound to become a relatively smaller and
smaller sample of U.S. common stocks as time goes on.
With data set 2, the series are a modified real Dow Jones Industrial
Average and associated real dividend series.
and disadvantages of data set 1 are reversed.

With this data set, the advantages
Our modifications in the Dow

Average assure that our series reflect the performance of a

single unchanging portfolio.

The disadvantage is that the performance of only

30 stocks is recorded.
The table reveals that all inequalities are dramatically violated by the
sample statistics for both data sets.

The left hand side of the inequality is

-21-

always at least 5 times as great as the right hand side, and as much as 13
times as great.
We saw above that the inequality (15) could be derived assuming only that
innovations in price are uncorrelated with the price level, cov(~t+lPt+l' Pt)
and the assumption that processes are stationary.

Since the inequality (15)

is violated dramatically, and processes do appear stationary we would expect
that the sample covariance between

In fact, if

These results

In fact, if the holding period

results that are only slightly less significant:

= 1.843,

.0457) for data set 2.
These regression tests, while technically valid, may not be as generally
useful for appraising the validity of the model as are the simple volatility
comparisons.

First, as noted above, the regression tests are not insensitive

to data misalignment.

2
Such low R might be the result of dividend or commodity

price index data errors.

Second, although the model is rejected in these very long

samples, the tests may not be powerful if we confined ourselves to shorter
samples, for which the data are more accurate, as do most researchers in finance,
while volatility comparisons may be much more revealing.

To see this, consider a

stylized world in which (for the sake of argument) the dividend series d
absolutely constant while the price series behaves as in our data set.

t

is

Since

the actual dividend series is fairly smooth, our stylized world is not too
remote from our own.

If dividends dtare absolutely constant, however, it should

be obvious to the most casual and unsophisticated observer by volatility

-22-

arguments like those made here that the efficient markets must be wrong.

Price

movements cannot reflect new information about dividends if dividends never
change.

Yet regressions like those run above will have limited power to

reject the model.

If the alternative hypothesis is, say, that Pt

= PPt-l + E t ,

where P is close to but less than one, then the power of the test in short
samples will be very low.

In this stylized world we are testing for the

stationarity of the Pt series, for which, as we know, power is low in short
samples. 19/

For example, if postwar data from, say, 1950-65 were chosen (a

period often used in recent financial markets studies) when the stock market
was drifting up, then clearly the regression tests will not reject.

Even in

periods showing a reversal of upward drift the rejection may not be significant.
Using expression (19), we can compute how big the standard deviation of
real discount rates would have to be to possibly account for the discrepancy
o

= cr2(~Pt) - cr 2 (d t )/(2r) between Table I results (columns 11 and 12) and rhe

inequality (15).

1 and -10.14% to 18.72% for data set 2!

And these ranges reflect lowest

possible standard deviations which are consistent with the model only if the
real rate has the first order autoregressive structure noted above! 20/

VII.

Conclusion
We did not attempt to test formally whether the inequalities on volatility

-2321/
which follow from the efficient markets model are violated.--Instead, we sought

to describe the data so as to clarify what kinds of assumptions are necessary
to reconcile it with the model.

Formal tests could be undertaken only under

some maintained hypothesis about the stochastic properties of the dividend
series (e.g., that they are an ARIMA process of low order) and our model tells
us nothing about the dividend series.

Standard data analysis procedures:

detrending,first differencing and estimating autoregressions or moving average
Fepresentations introduce certain biases in the testing procedures that we do
not wish to casually accept.

Depending on what we assumed as a maintained

hypothesis about the stochastic properties of the dividend series, we might or
might not reject the model.

We could not reject the model if our maintained

hypothesis allowed for a small probability of really enormous movement in d
which was not observed in the sample.

t

Such a maintained hypothesis might also

be described as allowing for a small probability each period of a major change
in trend.

Investors may well have been rationally adjusting their forecasts

in response to new information about this possible big event which did not occur.
The efficient markets model does tell us that the price innovation series
~tPt

is serially uncorrelated, and

which enables us to put a
(Table I).

~Pt

is approximately serially uncorrelated,

x 2 95% lower bound on their standard deviations

With this information alone we can summarize our basic conclusion:

the movements in detrended real price Pt over the last century can be justified
as the rational response to new information about anticipated future movements
in detrended real dividends d

t

only if these anticipated future movements were

many times bigger than those actually observed over the last century.

Thus,

the efficient markets model is at best an "academic" model about an unobservable
(new information about the trend) and does not describe observed movements in data.
Moreover, we have seen that if movements in the unobserved real interest rates
are instead invoked to explain the high volatility of prices (taking the

-24-

observed variance of d

t

a~-

the true variancef then these real interest rate

movements would have to be very large.

Average when it was created in 1928.

Dow Jones averages before 1928 exist,

but the 30 industrials series was begun in that year.

The published Dow Jones

Industrial Average, however, is not ideal in that stocks are dropped and replaced
and in that the weighting given an individual stock is affected by splits.
Of the original 30 stocks, only 17 were still included in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average at the end of our sample.

The published Dow Jones Industrial

Average is the simple sum of the price per share of the 30 companies divided
by a divisor which changes through time.

Thus, if a stock splits 2 for 1 then

Dow Jones continues to include only one share but changes the divisor to
prevent a sudden drop in the Dow Jones average.
To produce the series used in this paper, the Capital Changes Reporter
[1977} was used to trace changes in the companies from 1928 - 1979.

Of the

original 30 companies of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, today (1979) nine
have the identical names, 12 have changed only their names, and nine were
acquired, merged or consolidated.

For these latter nine, the price and dividend

series are continued as the price and dividend of the shares exchanged by the
acquiring corporation.

In only one case was a cash payment along with shares

of the acquiring corporation exchanged for the shares of the acquired corporation.
In this case, the price and dividend series were continued as the price and
dividend of common shares of equal value at time of acquisition.

In four cases

preferred shares of the acquiring corporation were among shares exchanged.
Common shares of equal value were substituted for these in our series.

The

number of shares of each firm included in the total is determined by the
splits, and effective splits effected by stock dividends and merger.

The

price series is the value of all these shares on the first trading day of the
year.

The dividend series is the total for the year of dividends and the cash

A-3

value of other distributions for all these shares.

The price and dividend

series were deflated using the same wholesale prices indexes as in data set 1.

FOOTNOTES

1/ The stock price index may look unfamiliar because it is deflated by a
price index, detrended, and only January figures are shown.

One might note,

for example, that the stock market decline of 1929-32 looks smaller than the
recent decline.

In real terms, it was.

The January figures also miss both

the 1929 peak and 1932 trough.

--' Of course, all indeterministic stationary processes can be given linear

moving average representations (Wold [1948)).

However, it does not follow

that the process can be given a moving average representation in terms of its
own innovations.

The true process may be generated nonlinearly or other

information besides its own lagged values may be used in forecasting.

These

will generally result in a less than perfect correlation of the eerms in (5).

12/ The empirical fact about the unconditional distribution of stock price
changes is not that they have infinite variance (which can never be demonstrated
with any finite sample) but that they have high kurtosis in the sample.

We may

then assume finite variance in face of high sample kurtosis at the risk that
our sample statistics may not be trustworthy measures of population variances.
The risk is that some subsequent movements in stock prices not yet observed
will have such magnitude as to swamp out our sample observations.

This risk

is analogous to that incurred when we assumed above that the dividend series
is stationary.

This risk that rare or unobserved events may yet force us to

drastically change our conclusions is inherent in all statistical research,
even when sample data show low kurtosis.

15/ LeRoy and Porter [1979} do assume price as present value of earnings but
employ a correction to the price and earnings series which is, under addi.tional
theoretical assumptions not employed by Miller and Modigliani, a correction for
the double counting.

how large must the

variance in liquidity premia be in order to justify the volatility of long-term
interest rates?
18/ This is not equivalent to the average dividend price ratio, which was
slightly higher (.0492 for data set 1, .0467 for data set 2).

Perfect negative correlation does not

allow much lower standard deviation for r, since d doesn't vary much.
These estimated standard deviations of ex-ante real interest rates are
roughly consistent with the results of the simple regressions noted above.

The regressions of

The standard deviation of the fitted value divided by the average detrended
