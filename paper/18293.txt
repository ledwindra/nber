ABSTRACT
This paper exploits the seasonal and annual changes in marginal prices for water to estimate the price
elasticity of demand by residential households for water. It uses the changes in distributions of water
using the census block group levels in response to changes in marginal prices of water for matched
months across years. This strategy reduces the interaction effects of outdoor use and demographic
fact in determining responsiveness to price. By comparing years that vary in overall water availability
the framework can recover measures of how responses to price vary with season and draught conditions.
The application is the urban Phoenix metropolitan area.

Measuring Price Elasticities for Residential Water Demand with Limited Information

I. Introduction
There is a growing recognition in both the professional and popular literatures that
water scarcity is a key policy issue which is essential to address in evaluating the effects
of climate change and long term sustainability of economic growth.1 Glennon’s [2009]
observations in his book, Unquenchable: America’s Water Crisis and What to Do About
It, describe the problem well:

“Water presents a surprising riddle. We can neither make nor destroy it, so our
supply is fixed yet it’s exhaustible because, as a shared resource used repeatedly,
some uses preclude future reuse. Water policy suffers from a profound
discontinuity between science and law…the result epitomizes the tragedy of the
commons: limitless access to a finite resource” (p. 324)

Those evaluating the water problem usually conclude prices must be reformed so
that incentives facing water users reflect this scarcity. Demand functions provide the
basic economic relationships required to predict how water use will respond to such
changes. This is where the problems arise. Access to detailed information on household
water use including household attributes (i.e. lot size, landscaping composition, and
presence of swimming pools), the composition of use (i.e. indoor versus outdoor usage),
and pricing is limited. The combination of concerns over confidentiality and in some

challenges.

cases legislation precluding access to micro-level data for individual customers served by
water providers creates a limited information setting for understanding water demand.
Nonetheless, following Chetty’s [2009] arguments, it is possible under some conditions
to recover key structural water demand parameters without either a structural model or
the ability to use data on specific customers.
In our application, the demand parameter we estimate is the price slope of a water
demand function for residential consumers at different water consumption levels. We use
this parameter to construct estimates for the price elasticity of demand, a key policy
variable of interest to local water providers. Our analysis uses order statistics derived
from micro level information on residential metered water use and prices which protects
the confidentiality of individual water customers. We control for unobservables by
exploiting our ability to link consumption and price data to spatial units. An important
element in our strategy stems from the ability to observe price and water consumption
changes over time.
In most water demand applications increasing block rate structures confound a
reduced form approach for recovering information about a structural parameter such as
the quantity response to a price change. Our application has only two blocks. Nearly all
residential consumers are in the second block and do not switch blocks when water prices
change. In many areas of the country where there is metering and pricing of water more
complex increasing block pricing structures are often found. Pricing policies with
multiple blocks transform the methods required to use records on households’ water
consumption patterns for estimating how the quantity of water used responds to price

4
changes.2 They also make the requirements for detailed information on household
attributes even more important. As a result of the increased modeling requirements
associated with more complex pricing structures it has been difficult to offer a detailed
characterization of the differences in water demand responses across small versus large
residential users. This shortcoming has direct policy relevance because there is broad
consensus in the U.S. that affordable access to water for “ordinary” household use must
be maintained for lower income groups.
This paper proposes a simple method for estimating the price elasticity of demand
that meets policy needs and can accommodate current data limitations. It can also be
implemented in the presence of simple increasing block pricing structures, such as the
two block structure used in Phoenix, AZ. In short, our method can estimate how water
usage responds to price changes under the typical conditions confronting applied
researchers with limited access to detailed household level micro data. Our data sample
was constructed as the thresholds for percentiles of water consumption at the census
block group level for a single municipal provider in Phoenix, AZ. Using the changes in
water consumption for selected percentiles over time our approach controls for housing
attributes, landscape attributes that don’t change, and socio-economic characteristics of
consumers while maintaining confidentiality of individual households’ records.
The seasonal and temporal changes in the Phoenix municipal water system’s
residential water rates are used to reconstruct a record of price changes that are
exogenously imposed on customers. The Phoenix water provider is a regulated utility
which is allowed to adjust prices annually to cover cost increases. By matching months

unconditional price elasticities.

5
that experienced changes in the marginal price for the same pricing block it is possible to
isolate the quantity adjustment associated with these specific price changes and be
assured there is no shifting of households between price blocks.3 The findings derived
using this simple strategy are striking. Despite limited price variation we estimate
statistically significant demand elasticities. Our results also allow the price
responsiveness to be distinguished by percentiles of consumption. Distinguishing the
price responsiveness of demand by the amount of water consumption we are able to
establish that there are relatively large differences in elasticities with the largest water
users appearing to be more price inelastic.
Estimation involves matching years where we compare two normal precipitation
years as well as a normal precipitation year to an exceptionally dry year. Separate models
are estimated for winter and summer demand. A comparison of the estimates for
approximately comparable price changes when there are different patterns of natural
precipitation conditions provides a simple plausibility check for the logic of the model.
That is, we should expect that natural increases in the need for water (due to dry
conditions) would make households with significant outside uses of water less responsive
to price increases. This is exactly what we find. The estimates of price elasticities for
residential customers in the summer months across all consumption percentiles reveal
they are much less responsive to price changes when the price comparison involves
responses in water use during dry conditions.
3

This strategy is consistent with Chetty’s [2009] call for a middle ground between
structural and reduced form (or treatment effect) approaches to policy evaluation. He
describes how research in public economics has focused on what he labels a “sufficient
statistic” or estimation strategies that focus on measuring parameters in transparent ways
with credible identifying information and yet focus on the key economic parameter for
policy evaluation and often welfare statements.

6
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section two outlines our
model and discusses its relationship to the conditional demand approach widely
advocated for estimating price elasticities with increasing block prices as well as to a
recent contribution by Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] exploiting a drought related water
pricing change in Santa Cruz.4 The third section describes our data and empirical
estimates. We conclude with comments on the applicability of our new approach in other
situations where response of water usage to price changes must be evaluated with limited
information.

II. Modeling Water Demand

A. Background
Most of the recent literature measuring the price elasticity of demand has been
based on the discrete / continuous choice (DCC) model developed by Hausman [1979]
for applications to labor supply.5 For demand models derived from choices with convex
budget sets (increasing block price structures), one need only specify a conditional
demand function to estimate the model. This relationship describes how the quantity
demanded responds to the marginal price within each budget segment (corresponding to
the segment associated with each step in the increasing block pricing structure).
Conventional practice assumes this demand function includes two errors. One is usually

4

An alternative structure based on using the first order conditions from the constrained
utility maximization problem is developed and illustrated in Strong and Smith [2010].
5
See Burtless and Hausman [1978] for discussion of the model with non-convex budget
constraint, Heckman [1983] for a critique and Reiss and White [2006] for discussion of
how welfare analysis can be undertaken with non-linear budget constraints.

7
hypothesized to be associated with household preference heterogeneity not captured in
observable variables. This feature is known to the household but not to the analyst. The
second is an error hypothesized to be unknown to both the household and the analyst. It
could arise from leaks in the water system, measurement errors, or a composite of both
effects. The two error terms allow the model to describe choice outcomes. This structure
is especially important for being able to include some households’ consumption choices
that would appear to have them falling at the kinks of the budget constraint.
As a rule, the consumption decision process is explained as if there were two
distinct steps: (1) a description of the probability that consumption will be in one of the
budget segments (or at a kink)6 and (2) conditional on each budget segment there is a
conditional demand function describing how the quantity of water demanded relates to
the marginal price.7 At a kink, there is no such relationship because the model implies
demand is higher than the highest value of the lower block but lower than the lowest
value of the next highest block. The parameters of the conditional demand are assumed
constant across segments to identify the model.8 This assumed constant parameter
structure for all budget segments does not simplify the relationship between conditional
and unconditional price elasticities.
As Olmstead et al. [2007] demonstrate, the unconditional price elasticity is a
function of both the conditional price elasticity and the income elasticity. As a result, the

6

There will be multiple kinks for more complex increasing block structures with several
steps in the increasing block structure.
7
In practice we simply observe households consumption that implies their consumption
affects the marginal price they face. The steps are used to separate the way the statistical
model uses available information so that the inherent simultaneity is represented
consistently in the econometric analysis.
8
See Strong and Smith [2010] for a discussion of the limitations of this assumption.

8
relationship of the unconditional price elasticity to the conditional elasticity is not clear.
Both the ranking of the two measures and the magnitude of the absolute difference
between them cannot be signed a priori. For their application Olmstead et al. found the
unconditional price elasticity of demand was smaller in absolute magnitude than the
conditional elasticity. Because the rate subsidies associated with increasing block price
structures are small, the price differences between blocks are small, and the expenditure
share for water in a household’s overall budget is small; the authors suggest their results
may provide a reasonable guide for the relationship with most communities’ residential
water demands.
Nonetheless, despite this relatively optimistic conclusion of the Olmstead et al.
study, the experience with the DCC model for water applications has been mixed. Hewitt
and Hanemann [1995] reported the first such application. They found large (in absolute
value) conditional price elasticities and report an unconditional elasticity for a price
structure change that is also large compared to the literature. Both the Espey et al. [1997]
and the Dalhausen et al. [2003] meta analyses of water demand studies found the
majority of the price elasticity estimates were less than unity in absolute magnitude.
Olmstead et al.’s results are consistent with these findings in that their conditional
elasticity estimate was approximately -0.34 and simulated unconditional estimates was 0.59.
The Olmstead et al. sample is also quite unique in that it pools household level
data across 11 urban areas in the U.S.9 One concern the authors raise is that the very
advantage of their data in displaying how households responded to a variety of price

The data are relatively old as are the data underlying Hewitt and Hanemann [1995].

9
structures may create a cause for concern. That is, the community’s tastes for water
conservation may be reflected in the provider’s rate structure. Communities with several
blocks and high marginal prices for the top blocks may also have strong mandates for
conservation. This logic seems especially relevant for public water providers where
revenues cannot exceed costs. Under these conditions revenues in excess of the costs of
service for the highest blocks must be offset by revenues below the costs of service for
lower blocks in order to meet the zero “profit” constraint.
In these situations the estimation of demand functions that are structured to be
conditional to a rate structure may also reflect the unobserved taste for conservation.
After a series of tests for this potential explanation of their findings Olmstead et al.
conclude that they cannot dismiss the hypothesis that the underlying city level taste for
conservation, through the design selected for each community’s price structure, may
contribute to the observed higher (in absolute value) elasticities. It would not be possible
to reproduce their study using a single water provider because the structure of a single
system’s price schedule is usually stable. Year to year changes in prices may well involve
small changes in marginal prices for selected blocks that are unlikely to have sufficient
variability in prices to distinguish the effect of a change in price from changes in
conservation motives over time.10
Recently Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] have exploited a natural demand shock
for water pricing in Santa Cruz, California using a regression discontinuity design to
10

One exception to this is Pint [1999] who estimates the DCC model for the Alameda
County Water District but argues that it would be difficult to take the results from the
estimation to other parts of California since the results are sensitive to climatic
conditions, a key point of our analysis. Additionally, the information available for her
analysis includes detailed information on household characteristics including house size
and lot size.

10
estimate how households responded to a new block in the block pricing schedule. In
response to a prolonged period of drought and after using price increases and various
non-price controls from 1987 to 1992, in February 1995 the Santa Cruz local government
introduced new rates to begin in June 1995. Prior to this time there was a two block
system. The 1994 rates priced the first eight hundred cubic feet (CCF) on the bi-monthly
metering schedule at $0.65/CCF and the next units of water were priced at $1.55/CCF.11
The new third rate applied to consumption over 40 CCF and was initially priced at
$3.14/CCF for use in excess of 40 CCF in a two month period.
This pricing scheme implied households consuming 40 or more CCF would
experience a change in the marginal price of consumption over this threshold. To exploit
this change they use prior water consumption as the threshold distinguishing treatment
and control households and investigate the effects of excluding households close to the
40 CCF cut off. Their findings indicate households did respond to the price change. This
result was confirmed in both robustness checks for the threshold and falsification tests for
the basic logic underlying the design. Unfortunately, the discrete nature of the price
change and the fact that it was limited to the largest consumers made it difficult to
develop general conclusions on the extent of price responsiveness to compare to the
literature. The authors did note that the water consumption response estimated for the 100
percent price increase implied a short run price elasticity of approximately -0.12. This
estimate falls at the low end of past estimates.
Our method builds on the Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] logic and exploits a set
of changes in the rate structure for residential customers in Phoenix, AZ that take place
11

Increases in rates of 6% in June 1995 and 5% in June 1996 and 1997 were part of the
plan to increase rates. The 5% rate increases in 1996 were to apply to the new block.

11
with every change of season. These rate changes are common across many water
providers in the Southwestern U.S. and are intended to reflect seasonal changes in
demand and supply of water. We adapt a proposal made by Borenstein [2009] for
considering residential elasticity demand and are able to consider how these changes
affect consumers with different total amounts of water usage at different times of the
year. Our approach does not estimate a structural demand. Instead, we hypothesize a
price response that can be locally approximated for small price changes with a linear
form. Changes in the distributions of water use in local neighborhoods, defined by census
block groups, associated with price increases over time are used to estimate elasticities
for different consumption percentiles. More specifically, we use the order statistics for
these consumption distributions to characterize the responses for different sized water
consumers to price changes.

B. A Quasi-Experimental Approach for Measuring Price Elasticities for Residential
Water Demand
Our analysis considers a single municipal water provider with a two block pricing
structure.12 Rates change in different months throughout the year corresponding to low,
medium, and high usage periods. Water and waste water are priced on the same metered
records. Thus, changes in either price affect incentives for water usage. The consumption
threshold for the increase in marginal price between blocks changes from 600 cubic feet
in low water use periods (winter) to 1000 cubic feet in high water use periods (summer).
Our estimation strategy exploits increases in rates over time that vary by different
12

The use of a block pricing structure is common for water providers; while the number
of blocks and cutoff points between blocks varies widely across different providers.

12
amounts for each usage period along with the ability to link individual meters to census
block groups, with each block group containing approximately 600 residential water
meters. To consider the first component of our analysis, the changes in marginal prices,
we use a linear specification for water demand as in equation (1).

w ijt   0  1 p jtb  f z i   g(T jt )  uijt

(1)

w ijt is the water consumed by household i in the month j of year t. Based on the metered

records for w ijt , we know p jtb , which is the bth block’s marginal price in month j of year
t. This is the block that corresponds to the water consumption w ijt . f(zi) is a function for
the effects of observable household attributes (zi) and g(Tjt) is the effect of weather
related variables – temperatures and precipitation in month j and year t. uijt is an error
that can be a composite of unobserved individual heterogeneity and measurement error.
To form a difference equation, we match the monthly records for each household
(meter) in each year of our data.13 For customers who remain in a constant price block
across years and months, we can difference equation (1) between two years in which a
marginal price change occurs to derive equation (2).

wijt  a  wijt   1  k  ( g (T jt  a )  g (T jt ))  (uijt  a  uijt )

13

(2)

The Phoenix water provider changes rates every year to cover increased water delivery
costs and maintenance.

13
k is the constant increment to the marginal price experienced between years (i.e.
and ). Using this specification the intercept in this difference equation estimates the
effect of price on water demand assuming the price change between the two months is
identical for each consumer. These differences can be pooled over months if the price
increment is the same. The differencing causes the demographic features, zi’s,
characterizing individual households to drop from the estimating model. This outcome
assumes these attributes don’t change at the scale of the census block group. One might
argue the lowest block’s price should also be included in the vector of zi’s due to an
adjustment in virtual income associated with the change in expenditures on the first block
of water. If the lower block’s price changes with linearity assumed for the effect of
income on water demand and all households remain in the top consumption block we
would expect the changes in this price to appear thru the income term. However, the
quantity limits distinguishing the blocks do not change for a given season so this
adjustment to income would be the same for all households. They would imply an
adjustment to the intercept for our difference model. In our case over the years
considered the first block’s price does not change.
Differencing eliminates the effects of the first block’s price if the sample’s
consumption remains in the second block and the first block price doesn’t change.
Fortunately, as we explain below, there are no households with changes between the two
blocks in response to the price changes for our sample. We did observe over the full year
that there are some households who change consumption blocks at the lowest levels of
water consumption in May. Considering the consumption levels realized by the top 80 to
85% of the households in Phoenix and removing May from our sample we avoid the

14
problems that would arise with households changing consumption blocks as prices
change.
Equation (2) is best considered an approximation. It relies on the effect of price
on water demand being locally constant. We would expect that price response would
depend on the features of each residential consumer’s living situation such as outdoor
landscape, number of bathrooms, the composition of water using appliances, and so forth.
We attempt to take account of these effects to estimate the changes in water demand at
different levels of consumption. More specifically, we alter equation (2) and construct
differences in the thresholds defining the 10, 25, 50, 75, and 95 percentiles for water
consumption in each block group to arrive at our estimating equation given in (3).

wnjt  a  wnjt   1  k  ( g (T jt  a )  g (T jt ))  ( njt  a   njt )

(3)

Consumption percentiles are represented by the subscript , and the precise thresholds
could be different households in different years. As noted earlier, we assume the
differences in the demographic attributes of households at each threshold defining the
percentiles are small and can be neglected. This is a limitation that arises with our data.
We do not have distributions for the economic and demographic attributes of households
in the census block groups over time. This formulation follows Borenstein’s [2009]
proposal for the case of modeling electricity demand. When the assumption that the
household defining each threshold has approximately the same attributes differencing the
same percentile across time for each block group removes these effects. It also removes
cross sectional features of neighborhoods that are constant across time, such as xeric or

15
mesic landscape, that might interact with the consumption responses to marginal price
changes.
As noted earlier only households at the lowest level of consumption display
sufficient reactions in their water use to the price changes over time to observe a shift
from one price block to another. Moreover, for this percentile, the changes that lead to
shifts across pricing blocks are limited to one month, May. This month precedes the high
use and highest price season. All of the remaining points on the distribution fall in the
highest block. By focusing on the highest and lowest water usage periods of the year
corresponding to winter and summer months, which do not include May, we avoid the
issue of block switching. Our estimates discussed in the next section report all
percentiles. Nonetheless for the lowest consumption groups demand responses may well,
over the full year, reflect the influence of the price threshold between blocks. For this
reason we argue the estimated water consumption response to prices is appropriate for
residential consumers that account for all but the lowest 10 to 15 percent of water
consumption.
Our strategy does allow us to estimate different conditional price elasticities for
different sized residential users. To our knowledge, this issue has not been considered in
the past literature. Nataraj and Hanemann [2011] measure the local price responsiveness
for one class of demanders. We can extend that logic to consider nearly the full
distribution of residential consumers. Moreover, it appears these types of distinctions can
be important for pricing policy when there are concerns with assuring affordable access
to low income users who tend to be in the lowest use percentiles.

16
III. Data and Price Elasticity Estimates
Our analysis is based on records for residential meters served by the municipal
Phoenix water system. We know the year, month, amount of water used, and the price
schedule for each meter which we treat as a user. These data do not include other
information about these households.14 After matching each meter to its block group and
information on weather conditions experienced in each block group for each month and
year we are left with between 993 and 996 records for each month in the three years
comprising our sample.15
Our analysis relies on isolating changes in the marginal prices for water over time.
These changes are not associated with any household moving between pricing blocks.
Table 1 displays the marginal prices for the highest water usage blocks by month for the
three years in our sample. This table depicts the changes in marginal prices that occur for
the highest block in different seasons. There are some months that display differences
from the low (December, January, February, March), medium (April, May, October,
November), and high (June, July, August, September) periods due to the timing of
allowed adjustments in the rate structure.
We use these monthly differences in prices for the low and the high usage period
as exogenous price differences to construct the quasi-experiment. As noted this difference
in the quantity thresholds for each consumption percentile at the block group level

14

This same limitation faced Nataraj and Hanemann. They used the average values for
demographic variables for each block group. The structure of the price changes applied to
every residential customer. As a result it is possible to difference out the effects of
demographics and focus on the price and weather related differences in demand for the
full distribution of consumers.
15
Block groups are constant across years. The slight difference in numbers of block
groups is a result of missing data.

17
differences out the effects of the housing distribution and neighborhood attributes. During
this period, the bulk of the new housing construction in the Phoenix area occurred outside
the Phoenix water provider’s district, making the assumption of constant housing and
neighborhood attributes reasonable given the short time periods we consider.
As Table 1 suggests, we selected three years for analysis and treat the year 2000
as our base year. This strategy provides two different sets of price changes to evaluate
using differences between the years 2000 versus 2002 and 2000 versus 2003. The years
2000 and 2003 were considered a pair of “normal” years in terms of precipitation while
year 2002 was unusually dry. We use the effects of these weather differences on our
elasticity estimates to judge the plausibility of our strategy for estimating price
responsiveness. Table 2 compares the weather variables and percentiles of consumption
use for each of the three years.
Our models also include controls for monthly differences in the minimum
temperature, the precipitation, and the days of precipitation interpolated for each block
group. These data came from approximately 15 NOAA monitoring stations located
around the Phoenix area that collected information during the months used for our
analysis. Each monitoring station reports daily data on temperatures and precipitation.
We averaged temperatures in each month at each monitor to form a series of monthly
specific temperature variables. For precipitation, we used monthly counts of the total
number of days in which rainfall was detected as well as the total amount of rainfall
(measured in inches). Each block group in our sample is assigned the weather data from
the closest monitor.

18
Different months experience different price changes. Comparing the price
changes over all months between the years 2000 and 2003 we observe price changes
varying from $0.14 to $0.31 (per 100 cubic feet). Eight months fall between the ranges of
$0.14 to $0.17. Comparing years 2000 and 2002 the range is $0.08 to $0.19. The model is
estimated separately for each of two sub-samples and each percentile – restricting the
data to include only winter (low-December, January, and February) and only summer
(high-June, July, August, and September) seasons.
Before discussing our estimates for price responsiveness we should discuss the
implications of using a difference in an order statistic as the dependent variable in each
model. We examine the quantity response to price changes at the k percentile of
consumption. There is a well-established literature on the properties of order statistics
used in multivariate statistical models. Linear functions of order statistics are often
known as L statistics and as L estimators when they are used to estimate parameters of an
underlying distribution. When the L statistic is a function of a finite number of central
order statistics or a finite number of extreme order statistics, we can use established
properties of their asymptotic joint distribution to obtain the limiting distribution for the
L statistics. For example, in the case of a fixed number of central order statistics the
limiting distribution is normal under mild conditions on the parent distribution. Indeed,
asymptotic normality has been established by putting relatively mild conditions on the
weighting function or the parent distribution.16 Both are consistent with what would be
conventional practice with analyses of micro data. Thus, it seems reasonable to interpret

A good overview of these conditions with citations to the primary results is found in
Chapter 8 of Arnold, Balakrishnan and Nagaraja [2008].

19
the test statistics for our parameter estimates as asymptotically normal and follow
conventional practices in interpreting the test statistics.
Table 3 reports our estimates for the first difference model for these two seasons
and for each paired price change (2000-2003 and 2000-2002). The intercept in each set
of models is the key focus of the analysis for evaluating the effects of price on
consumption. This parameter is precisely estimated in comparing summer consumption
for normal weather years. For winter use, large users are not responsive to price but
otherwise respond during summer months. What is especially striking is the contrast
when we consider a price change comparing a normal and a dry year. Here all users are
price responsive but the pattern of adjustment is informative. In the summer months all
users, but especially large users, are less responsive to price changes during dry
conditions.
In comparing a dry and normal year changes in precipitation are the same sign in
both winter and summer months. The amount of precipitation, as Table 2 shows, has
declined so the change is negative between 2002 and 2000. This precipitation effect
increases demand in both winter and summer. By contrast, in comparing the two normal
years the effect depends upon season. To assess the overall impact we need to consider
changes in the amount of precipitation and its distribution over days. Changes in each of
these variables have opposite signs for the summer and winter models.
For the comparison of the normal and dry year the two effects are consistent
between the winter and summer models. Reductions in precipitation lead to increases in
water use and reductions in the number of days of precipitation reduce water usage for

20
both seasons. Precipitation declines in the winter increase water use, while in the
summer the effect depends on both the change in amount and days of precipitation.17
Table 4 presents the primary results of our analysis – estimates of the demand
elasticity using comparisons between two normal years and a normal and a dry year to
identify the price effect. Our estimates using percentiles can be distinguished by the size
of residential customers. This distinction, as expected based on Nataraj and Hanemann
[2011], plays an important role in parsing out the heterogeneity in household level
estimates for the price elasticities.
Comparing the first panel of Table 4 for normal / normal versus the second panel
for normal / dry we see directly that price responsiveness is reduced quite substantially
for the summer months when the overall situation is abnormally dry. In winter months,
we see responsiveness to price changes across all consumption percentiles. We also find
that larger users are uniformly less responsive to price across all seasons regardless of
weather conditions. To our knowledge this is the first time a water demand study has
been able to extract these distinctions and control for the effects of the block structure.

IV. Implications
When the DCC approach was first proposed to model labor supply and evaluate
the effect of policies to change income taxes Heckman [1983] raised a number of
questions about the ability of analysts to assume the actual points specifying the kinks in
the budget constraint, due to tax structure, were exogenous. In addition, he noted that

17

standard errors.

21
with exogenous kink points there should be “bunching at the kinks.”18 These kink points
are exogenous in the case of increasing block price structures for water; however in
preliminary analysis of the Phoenix residential water data we did not observe this
bunching. This may reflect the simplified rate structure residents in the Phoenix area
faced where most residential customers are in the highest block throughout the year due
to the relatively low consumption threshold defining pricing blocks. As a result, there
would be no meaningful variation in the marginal price for these customers. The seasonal
changes in rates would be experienced by all water consumers at the same time and
responses to the price changes would be difficult to separate from changes in water needs
due to the temperature changes throughout the year. The Phoenix system’s price structure
is not unique. As a result, it may be reasonable to assume the opportunities for
adjustments among blocks for many water systems are limited and the distinction
between conditional and unconditional price responses small. The “action” in estimating
price responses may well be in considering price changes over time and allowing
flexibility in the nature of the price response by the quantity of water consumed.
A further limitation to what has become the conventional approach to demand
modeling, as Olmstead et al. suggest, is the concern about whether the price structure is
truly exogenous. Under these conditions pooling data across communities to provide
variation in price schedules may also include differences inherent in the conservation
motives of the households in these communities. These types of applications also would
not have sufficient information to distinguish taste parameters for conservation from the
parameters reflecting price responses. Limiting the analysis to a single community would

18

22
not provide a sufficient basis for identifying the price response either. This concern
would lead to preferences for models that do not start with the conditional demand
function defined for a given price structure and instead a framework that begins from a
preference specification such as Strong and Smith [2010]. Of course, this approach adds
considerable structure in the assumed specification for preferences.
We have proposed a different strategy for estimating demand responses more
consistent with the compromise advocated by Chetty [2009]. It combines two elements.
The first is Borenstein’s proposal to consider how order statistics summarizing the
distribution of use, constructed at the census block group level, change with exogenous
price changes. The second element involves exploiting changes in marginal prices over
time (to reflect provider cost increases) that can be matched by month so the position of
water consumption in the price structure is unchanged. This matching process assures the
increment to the marginal price can be used as an exogenous change from the
household’s perspective. As a result, the price change can be treated as a type of
treatment for evaluating the change in water usage.
Our application to the Phoenix residential market indicates this approach is
remarkably effective. It does not require the structural assumptions of the DCC approach,
allows estimates of price responsiveness by size (in terms of water use) of customer, and
was also effective in discriminating how lower than normal precipitation in an arid desert
environment can reduce price responsiveness, especially for large users. We interpret this
ability to detect a role for differences in seasonal rainfall as confirming evidence that
supports our direct approach. It also indicates that matching a simple theoretical model of
demand response with an exogenous source of price variation can allow measurement of

23
demand elasticities. Our use of the order statistic to characterize demand provides a
strategy that recognizes the importance of a price change to any individual household will
depend on the amount of water used. More complex increasing block price schedules can
be accommodated in this logic with enough ability to observe within block changes in
marginal prices over time.
For empirical demand estimation, our findings of substantial heterogeneity and
variation over time should be informative for the specification of future structural
models. In addition to informing future structural models, there are also several
limitations of the method provided in this paper that could be confronted in future
research. Perhaps most glaring is that we rely on the relatively short time frame of study
and relatively non-binding pricing block structure of Phoenix. Confronting endogeneity
from changes in price blocks, how to handle differences across larger geographic areas
such as metropolitan areas, and incorporation of longer-run changes in response through
changes in appliances or landscape remain open questions deserving of future research.
By demonstrating the ability to overcome the typical setting of limited access to micro
data on water consumption information we hope that this approach offers a practical basis
for meeting many of the needs of policy makers managing local water resources. Reliable
estimates of price elasticities distinguished by seasonal and weather conditions can help
to assess how water use (and provider revenues) will change with price changes.
