Breath Testing and the Demand for Drunk Driving

ABSTRACT

This paper presents an empirical

investigation of the

effect of a preliminary breath test law on drunk driving behavior.
A preliminary breath test law reduces the procedural problems

associated with obtaining evidence of drunk driving and thus
increases the probability that a drunk driver will be arrested. In
1985, only 23 states had a preliminary breath test law. According
to the theory of deterrence, increasing the probability of arrest
for drunk driving will reduce the future occurrence of this
behavior.

The data set employed to test the theory is a time
series from 1980 to 1985 of cross sections of the 48 contiguous
states. Four highway mortality rates are used as measures of drunk
driving. The effect of the breath test law was estimated using four
independent variable models and 12 dummy variable models. The four
independent variable models were also estimated using Learner's
specification

test.

The
purpose of using these alternative
specifications and Learner's specification test was to examine the

breath test coefficients for

specification bias. The econometric

show that the passage of a breath test

law has a

significant deterrent effect on drunk driving. Simulations with
these results suggest that if all states had a preliminary breath
test law, highway mortality could be reduced by about 2000 deaths
per year.

I. Introduction

Over the past few years, public awareness of the social cost

of alcohol abuse has been increasing. A particular area of concern

is the number of alcohol related motor vehicle accidents. Highway
mortality is the third leading cause of death for people aged 35 to
54 and the leading cause of death for people under 35. The National

Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that alcohol is
involved in about 50 percent of these accidents. Because of these

statistics, the evaluation of deterrents to drunk driving is an
important goal of policy research.

As a response to public pressure, a number of states have
enacted legislation designed to reduce alcohol

related traffic

deaths. Becker (1968) has shown that the deterrent effect of
legislation can be described in terms of expected utility. This
approach assumes that an individual will commit an offense if its
expected

utility

exceeds

the expected utility derived from

alternative activities. While some drunk

driving is impulsive,

expected utility can be used to model drunk driving behavior since

the choice of drinking and then driving is, a priori, a rational
decision. The expected utility approach implies that the number of

offenses committed by an individual is negatively related to the

cost of each offense. The cost of each offense is a positive
function of the probability of arrest and
severity of punishment if convicted.

conviction and the

2

The probability of arrest while driving drunk is very low in

many states. Ross (1984) reports that this probability is generally

around one in a thousand. One reason this probability is so low is

the procedural difficulties the police encounter in obtaining
acceptable evidence of drunk driving. In many stateB, a suspected
drunk driver must be arrested before any tests for intoxication can
be performed. After the arrest the police must transport the driver
to a testing station where a test of blood alcohol concentration is

performed. This test can only be administered by trained medical
personnel. Only the results of this test can be used as evidence

of drunk driving.

A second reason the arrest probability is very

low is because the police are reluctant to
suspicion

of

arrest drivers on

drunk driving. Foley (1986) reports that this

reluctance is due to the fact that most drinking drivers are
primarily middle class with more political ties than the average
person who is arrested.

To reduce the problems associated with detecting drunk
drivers, several states have recently enacted a preliminary breath

test law. This law allows the police to administer a breath test
for blood alcohol concentration without first arresting the driver.
This test can be administered on the highway without the assistance

of medicalpersonnel. Many states with preliminary breath test laws

now also accept these test results, in place of blood tests, as
evidence of drunk driving. Drivers who pass the breath test are
free to go without further delay and without a record of arrest.

3

The preliminary breath test thus allows the police to screen more
drivers and increases the probability of detecting drunk drivers.

Many states have adopted various other laws designed to
increase the probability of conviction and severity of punishment.
To increase the probability of conviction, most states have enacted

a per Be law. This law makes driving with a given blood alcohol
concentration conclusive evidence of drunk driving. The per se law

results in the automatic conviction of drivers who fail the blood
alcohol concentration test. In 1985, 43 states had per se laws. All

but two of these states required a blood alcohol concentration of
10 percent or more for automatic conviction of drunk driving. The
two

remaining

states

required

.08

percent

blood alcohol

concentration for automatic conviction. In addition, many states
have increased the severity of punishment by adopting mandatory

sanctions. These sanctions include fines, license suspension or
revocation and imprisonment or community service.

In 1985, 35

states had some type of mandatory sanction for a first conviction
on drunk driving.

The preliminary breath test law is particularly important
since this law can have a greater impact on potential drunk drivers

than the per se law or mandatory sanction laws. The reason the
preliminary breath test affects more drivers than per se laws is

that a

.

10

percent blood alcohol concentration is required before

the per se laws have any application. The preliminary breath test

also can affect more drivers than the

mandatory sanction laws

4

because blood alcohol concentrations under the per se level are not
considered conclusive evidence of impairment. This allows for plea-

to a lesser charge to avoid mandatory sanctions.

bargaining

According to the National Council on Alcoholism, a blood alcohol
concentration of

.

10 percent represents consumption that is far in

excess of typical consumption.

1

Therefore, the per se laws, and

because of plea—bargaining, the mandatory sanction laws, increase

the expected cost of drunk driving primarily for individuals who

drink abnormal amounts of alcohol. The breath test, however,
because it increases the probability of detection, can result in a
of

variety

lesser charges imposed on individuals who would

otherwise have escaped detection.

The purpose of this paper is to test the effect that the
preliminary breath test law has on drunk driving. The focus on the

breath test is important since it is an efficient method of
increasing the probability of arresting a drunk driver. The number

of states which have this law has increased from 13 in 1980 to 23
in

1985.

However,

no

study has specifically examined the

effectiveness of the preliminary breath test in deterring drunk
driving in the United States.

There have been a number of prior studies of drunk driving

deterrence policies. Ross provides an extensive review of this
literature. The British Road Safety Act of 1967 was one of the more

important legislative initiatives since it served as a model for

5

several other counties. This Act Bet

a specific blood alcohol

concentration of .08 percent as the definition of inebriation and
permitted the use of a preliminary breath test. The Act did not
increase the severity of existing penalties for drunk driving. Roes

reports that the police were restrained in the enforcement of the
new law and the courts required strict adherence to the details of

the law which reduced the chance of conviction. However, using
interrupted time series analysis, Rose concludes that the Act did
have a deterrent effect on drunk driving, at least for a few years.

Roes also reviews research on deterrence legislation in
France,
the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. He
finds that there have been serious methodological problems involved
in
the
evaluation
of
deterrence laws in these countries.
Nevertheless,

Ross

concludes

that

there is evidence of a

significant deterrence effect in these countries. The magnitude of
the deterrence effect, however, varies with the public's perception
that these laws will be enforced.

II. Empirical Framework

Following Becker's work on deterrence, an empirical model is
derived

from

a

theoretical

model

of

constrained utility

maximization. The arguments in the individual's utility function

are drunk driving, other goods and taste. The budget constraint
includes income,

the price of drunk driving and the price of other

6

goods. The price of drunk driving is determined by the price of
alcohol, the expected costs of a driving accident and the expected

penalties for drunk driving. The expected costs of a driving
accident are dependent on the probability of an accident and the
direct and indirect costs of all damage borne by the drunk driver.2

The expected penalties for drunk driving are dependent on the
probabilities of arrest and conviction and the sanctions generally

imposed on convicted drunk drivers. This budget

constraint is

nonlinear since the cost of drunk driving increases

with the

quantity of drunk driving. Optimization of the utility function
results in a demand for drunk driving equation. The arguments of

the demand function are the probability and expected cost of a
highway accident, the probabilities of arrest and conviction, the

penalties for drunk driving and alcohol demand variables. This
equation

can

be

aggregated across individuals to yield an

empirically estimable demand for drunk driving equation.

Over the past few years a number of researchers have sought

empirical verification of Becker's deterrence hypothesis. These
studies often employ an aggregated cross section of annual data.

Like all other econometric studies, these empirical deterrence
models must address problems with specification, measurement and
endogeneity.

Empirical deterrence studies whic.h have employed time series

data and interrupted time series analysis have also encountered

methodological problems. The data used in these studies often

7

consist of a few years of monthly observations. To insure that the
legislative
generally

change

occurred in a single time period it is

necessary to limit the data to a single jurisdiction.4

The time series data used in a deterrence study should be extensive

enough to correctly identify trend, seasonality and random error.

Trends in drunk driving data

occur as a result of gradually

shifting demographic patterns or as a result of gradually changing

opinions about health and alcohol.

Seasonality occurs in drunk

driving data due to the year—end holidays. Identifying random error

is difficult when the data is limited to small jurisdictional
aggregates. An additional problem with interrupted time series
analysis

is

the difficulty of separating the effects

of a

legislative change from other changes that may have occurred at
about the same time. These other changes include changes in gas
prices

and

availability,

changes

in

alcohol

prices

availability, changes in insurance costs, new roads

and

or other

driving legislation.

In this study pooled cross section and time series data are

used in regressions of a measure of drunk driving on a set of
independent variables. The independent variables include

a breath

test variable, highway conditions variables, alcohol availability
variables and a set of time dummies. The time dummies are included
to control time variation in the dependent variable. The advantage
of this specification is its ability to provide a separate estimate
of

the effect on drunk driving of all included independent

variables. Breath test coefficients estimated by this type of model

a
can

be interpreted as measuring the effect of introducing a breath

test law holding constant other factors affecting drunk driving and
any time trend in drunk driving.

Breath test coefficients from independent variable models of

this type should be tested for specification error.

This iB

important because regression coefficients can be sensitive to the

choice of independent variables included in

the specification.

Researchers have generally treated this problem by presenting a set

of alternative specifications of independent variables. These sets

of regressions, however can only represent a small subset all
possible relevant specifications.

Learner (1982) proposes an alternative method of treating the

specification problem. The independent variables are divided into
necessary variables and doubtful variables. The necessary variables

must be included in any specification while the doubtful variables

may be excluded. Learner's procedure

uses the data matrix from a

specification which includes all doubtful variables and the data
matrix from a specification which constrains all doubtful variables
to have coefficients equal to zero. These two matrices are weighted

by the inverse of their respective equation error variances.
Varying the error variance from the

constrained equation will

generate a range of estimated coefficients. The degree of variation
in the necessary variable coefficients reveals their robustness.6

9

111. Data

The data used in this Study consist of state aggregates for
the 48 contiguous states for the time period 1980 through 1985. The

mean value and summary definition of

each variable is found in

table one.

Highway mortality accident rates
measures

of

are the best empirical

drunk driving available. While not

all highway

mortality is the result of drunk driving, there is a strong
correlation between the two measures. Several highway mortality
rates

are

available.

The

National

Highway Traffic Safety

Administration estimates alcohol involved highway mortality rateB
based on statistical factors. As an alternative to these estimated

rates, four age and time specific

mortality rates are used as

dependent variables in this study.7 The first mortality rate
includes all mortality regardless of the age of the victims and

time of the accident and is called the total mortality rate. The
second mortality rate is limited to drivers who died between 12
a.m. and 4 a.m. and is called the night driver mortality rate. The
National Highway Traffic Administration estimates that 75 percent

to 90 percent of these drivers

had been drinking. The third
mortality rate is limited to highway mortality of 15 to 24 year
olds and is called the youth mortality rate. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration

estimates that the alcohol involved

accident rate for young drivers is three times that of older
drivers. The last mortality rate is limited to drivers aged 15 to

10

24, killed between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. This mortality rate is called

the night driver youth mortality rate. There are no estimates of
alcohol involvement for these drivers, but based on the other
estimates, it is likely that a large percentage of these drivers
had been drinking.

Each mortality rate is computed as motor vehicle deaths by

state divided by the relevant state population.

Motor vehicle

mortality by state come from the Fatal Accident Reporting System
and the data pertain to state of occurrence rather than state of
residence. The population data are from the Census Bureau.

Since the mortality rate has a restricted range, a logistic

specification will conform to the data more closely than a linear
specification. The logistic specification is most easily achieved
by transforming the mortality rate to ln(M/1—M), where N iB the

mortality rate and in is the natural logarithm. Maddala (1983)
shows that weighted least squares should be used with this logistic
transformation.

11

Three measures are included in the regressions as empirical

proxies for the probability and cost of a highway accident. They
are the number of vehicle miles traveled in 100,000's of miles per

licensed driver, the number of licensed drivers aged 24 years or
less as a fraction of all licensed drivers, and the average vehicle

speed in miles per hour. Similar variables have

been used in

interstate studies of the determinants of motor vehicle death rates

by Peltzman (1975) and Lave (1985). The number of vehicle miles
traveled per driver reflects motor vehicle use and highway density
and

is

expected to have a positive regresBion coefficient.

According to Peltzman (1975), because young drivers have a higher
demand for risky driving, they are more likely to have an accident

than older drivers. An increase in the per capita number of young
drivers should have a positive effect on the mortality rates. The

average vehicle speed should also have a positive effect on
mortality

rates

since the probability of collision and

the

consequences of colli1on are positively related to speed.

The number of licensed drivers of all ages, the number of

licensed drivers aged 24 or less, average vehicle speed and the
number of vehicle miles traveled are published by the Federal
Highway

Administration.

The

Federal

Highway

Administration

estimates vehicle miles of travel from data on gasoline consumption
and motor vehicle registration by state. The average speed data are
derived from state certification reports.

12

Real per capita personal income is also included in the
demand curve. This variable should be positively related to the

demand for beer, to the quality and condition of motor vehicles,
and to safe driving practices. The last relationship emerges
because income and education are positively

related and more

educated persons are likely to be safer drivers. The predicted
effect of income on the mortality rate is thug, ambiguous. The
income data was published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Another variable included in the demand curve is the state
unemployment rate. This variable may measure alcohol consumption or

driving. Unemployment may be a stress factor increasing alcohol
consumption. Alternatively, unemployment may reduce driving because
of reduced work related travel and reduced income.

In the demand for drunk driving equation

the price of

alcohol is measured by the excise tax on beer. Excise tax data was

chosen to measure price since it is the most reliable price data
available.9 Because the tax data on various alcoholic beverages are

highly correlated, only one beverage tax can be used in the

regressions. Data on beer was chosen since beer is the the most
popular alcoholic beverage in the U.S.

The beer tax variable is defined as the sum of the Federal
and state excise tax rates on a case of 12 ounce containers of beer
divided

by

the annual national Consumer Price Index

(CPI).

Deflation by the CPI is required to take account of trends in

13

prices of other goods between 1980 and 1985. Each regression 18
estimated with time dummy variables to control time trend in the
price data and time trend In the other variables. The real beer tax

is thus an accurate indicator of the

relative price of beer

provided the non-tax component of the relative price is not state
dependent.

The Federal excise tax on a case of beer was fixed in
nominal terms at 64 cents during the sample period. State excise
tax rates were obtained from the U.S. Brewers Association (1985).
If a state raised its tax during the year rather than on January 1,

its tax for the year is computed as a weighted average of the
higher and lower rates. The weights are the fraction of the year
that each rate was in effect.

The legal drinking age variable is the minimum age for the
purchase of beer with alcohol content of 3. 2 percent or more. These
data come from Wagenaar (1.981/1982) and the Digest of State Alcohol
Related Legislation.

Three other alcohol variables are Included In the demand
curve. These variables are included as determinants of unobserved

exogenous alcohol sentiment. For example, anti—alcohol sentiment
should be relatively widespread in states in which those religious
groups that oppose the use of alcohol are prevalent. The first and

second of these variables are defined
state

who

Mormons

as the percentage of the

Southern Baptists,

14

respectively. The third variable measures other church membership

and is defined as the percentage of the state population who are
Protestants

and

Catholics

(excluding

Southern Baptists and

Mormons). These variables were available only for the years 1971
and

1980. Estimates for 1981 through 1985 were computed by

logarithmic trend.

IV. Results

The

estimation results from the independent variable

specifications are presented in table two and the results for the

dummy variable specifications and the Learner test presented in
table three. Table two contains the estimation results from four
cross sectional models in columns one through four. These models
have different dependent variables but are otherwise identical. The
dependent variables are respectively: the total mortality rate, the

night driver mortality rate, the youth mortality rate, and the
night driver youth mortality rate. Table three contains only the
coefficients

of

the

preliminary breath test. The dependent

variables used in table two are repeated in the same order in table

three. The coefficients reported in panels A, B and C of table
three are dummy variable models. These models use the breath test
variable with state and time dummies only. The Learner specification

test is reported in panel D of Table three. For convenience, the
breath test coefficients of table two are repeated in panel E of
table three.

15

In table two, the coefficient of the preliminary breath test

is negative and significant in all four specifications. Since the

functional form of each equation is logistic, and the mortality

rate is very small, the breath test coefficient approximately
equals the percentage differential between the mortality rate in
states with the test compared to states without the test, net of
all other factors. Table two shows that the breath test law has a

larger effect on night driver mortality than on total mortality.
This could be due to the higher level of alcohol involvement in

night driver mortality than in total mortality. The breath test
coefficients in both youth mortality equations are also larger than

the coefficient in the overall mortality equation. This again is
probably due to the higher level of alcohol involvement in youth
mortality than in total mortality.

The highway variables in the demand for drunk driving
equation measure the probability and expected severity of highway

accidents. These variables are measures of total vehicle miles
driven, the number of young drivers and average vehicle speed. Each

of these variables is positive and significant in each regression
in table two.

The two income variables, real income and unemployment are

both negative and significant in each specification in table two.
The

negative

income coefficient suggests that higher income

individuals are safer drivers and operate vehicles that are in

16

better physical condition. The negative unemployment coefficient

suggests that in areas with relatively high unemployment, people
drive less or do less drinking away from home.

The alcohol variables are included in the demand for drunk
driving

equation

measures of alcohol consumption. These

as

variables are the real beer tax, the drinking age and religious
sentiment variables. The real beer tax is negative and significant
in all four specifications presented in table two. The magnitude of

the beer tax coefficient is larger in all three subgroups than in
the

overall mortality equation. Since alcohol involvement

is

greater in these subgroups, the effect of alcohol prices should be

larger. Saffer and Grossman (1987a, 1987b) estimate the effect of
beer

taxes

on

mortality

youth

rates.

Their results are

approximately the same as the results reported in table two. The
legal

drinking

age

is

negative in each specification and

significant in the three subgroup specifications. The religious
sentiment variables are generally negative and significant. The
Mormon variable is negative and significant in all specifications.

Finally, the other church

specification except the night driver youth mortality regression.

The preliminary breath test coefficients for three dummy
variable models are presented in panels A, B and C of table three.

All preliminary breath test coefficients in these models are

17

negative and significant. Panel A of this table contains the
results for models using the breath test and time dummies only.
These models are equivalent to those of

table two with the

exclusion of all independent variables except the breath test. The

coefficients in panel A are approximately the same as in panel E.
This indicates that no distorting collinearity is introduced by the
inclusion of the independent variables.

Panel B of table three contains the results for models
using the preliminary breath test, a set of 47 state dummies and
three time dummies. Any influences on mortality that were excluded
from the models in table two are controlled by the inclusion of the

state dummies. Three time dummies

were dropped because of the

collinearity introduced by the 47 state dummy variables. 11 If the
time trend in the dependent variables is not

completely controlled

when the three time dummies are dropped there will be an upward
bias in the breath test coefficients. However, the results reported

in panel B are again approximately the same as those in panel E.
This suggests that the exclusion of relevant independent variables
from

the models reported in table two have not biased the

preliminary breath test coefficients in any significant way.

Panel C of table three contains the results for models
using the state dummies only. The coefficients of the preliminary

breath test are clearly larger than in the models which control
time trend.

18

The results from the Learner procedure are presented in panel

D of table three. Learner suggests that the error variance from the

constrained equation be set at one fourth and four. As this error

is increased, the computed breath test coefficients

variance

approach the coefficients of the independent variable models.

The Learner procedure produces coefficient estimates which

are within the range delineated by panels E and C. This suggests

that any alternative subsets of the variables used in table two
would generate the same conclusions regarding the effects of the
breath

test.

V. Conclusions

The purpose of this paper was to estimate the effect a
preliminary

breath test law has drunk driving. Four different motor

vehicle mortality rates were used as measures of drunk driving. The

effect of the breath test was estimated using four independent
variable models and 12 dummy variable models. The four independent
variable models were also estimated using Learner's procedure. The

purpose of using these alternative specifications

and Learner's

procedure was to test the breath test coefficient for specification

bias. The econometric tests show that the passage of a breath test
law has a significant deterrent effect on drunk driving.

19

The final empirical problem to be considered is estimation
of the number of lives that could have been saved if all states had

a preliminary breath test law during 1985. Since the mortality
equation is in logistic form, the log odds ratio, which would have

occurred in 1985 if all states had
estimated. Thie estimated ratio is

a breath test law, must be

equal to the actual 1985 log

odds ratio, plus the breath test coefficient times one minus the
percent of states with a breath test law in 1985. The actual log

odds mortality rate in 1985

was -8.60133. The the breath test

coefficient used for this calculation is the average of the breath

test coefficients from two total

mortality regressions. These

regressions are the state and time dummy regression reported in
panel B of table two and the independent variable regression
reported in panel E of table three. The total mortality regressions

were used because this is the most inclusive mortality rate. The
state and time dummy regression and the independent variable
regressions were chosen because these are the most inclusive
specifications. The average of these two breath test coefficients

is -.0679. The value of one minus the percent of states with a
breath test law in 1985 is .521. The estimated log odds ratio of
mortality, if all states had a breath test law is thus -8. 63832.

This is equal to total

mortality of 41,971. Since the actual

mortality in 1985 was 43,982, if all states had a breath test law,
mortality would have been reduced by 2011 deathB.

20

Finally, while the breath test law has been shown to reduce

drunk driving, many other anti-drunk driving laws have recently
been enacted. The most notable of these new laws are the mandatory

sanctions for drunk driving. These sanctions

include mandatory

revocation and mandatory imprisonment. Analysis of the deterrent

effects of these new laws remains an important topic for future
research.

consume five drinks of 80 proof liquor

2) All the costs of drunk driving may not be borne by the drunk

driver. Sanctions against drunk driving are a method of internalizing
the expected or actual externalities created by drunk driving.

3> Learner (1983) provides an example of the consequences of these
specification problems in estimation of the deterrence effect of
capital punishment.

4) See McPheters et a!. (1984) for an example of this type of study.

Endogeneity of the breath test may be a problem. However,
may be viewed as an omitted variable problem. The

significantly affected by omitted variable bias.

7) Actual mortality data is preferable to estimated data because
the estimated data contains an error which may bias the regression
coefficients.

8) The weight for the difference specification is:
(1/n) (1/N1 ( 1—N1) +1/M0( 1—N0)]

where N1 is the mortality rate in the latter year and N0
is the mortality rate in the earlier year.

9) The excise tax on beer is a preferred measure of price. Assume that
the price of beer, exclusive of tax, varies among states because the
supply curve slopes upward. Under this assumption, an increase in the
demand for beer will simultaneously raise the price of beer, the
quantity of beer consumed and the mortality rate. This would result in
a biased price coefficient in the demand regression.

10) No consistent data sources could be found for the
sample period to
measure mandatory sanctions for drunk driving. These
data would be
desirable since estimates of the effects of these laws
are of
interest. The specification tests show that omitted

11) The Belsley, Kuh and
collirlearity test found the time
dummies for 1980, 1981 andWelsch
1985 with the highest
Condition index.
Therefore, instead of the usual case of dropping a single
dummy, all
three dummies were dropped from

the models using the 47 state dummies.
