PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CANADIAN—OWNED
AND FOREIGN-OWNED FIRMS USING TRANSLOG-PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS

ABSTRACT

The discussion of foreign ownership in Canada frequently refers to a
conventional

view that foreign—owned firms are larger, more capital—intensive,

pay higher wages and are more efficient. Evidence for these characterizations
has unfortunately come from comparisons of partial productivity measures of
labor or measures of average capital—intensity, with all the uncertainty that

this entails. It is the object of this paper to compare the technology
characteristics of Canadian and US—owned establishments in Canada by means of

a translog production function estimate, utilizing micro level data. While we
find strong evidence for the view that the two groups operate with different
technologies, and that US—owned establishments are larger, we do not find
support for the conventional view that US—owned establishments are more
capital—intensive, have higher labor productivity, or lower costs of
production.

PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CANADIAN—OWNED
AND FOREIGN—OWNED FIRMS USING TRANSLOG—PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

The econometric analysis presented here has as its purpose to
determine the nature of technology differences between domestic and

foreign—owned firms in Canada, for a sample of eight industries. As
a background to this, we first review the key issues of public
discussion on foreign—ownership in Canada to provide a clearer policy
perspective and to identify the principal hypotheses pertaining to
technology, some of which the present analysis is able to elucidate.

This is done in the rest of Part I, while in Part II the model is
presented, and in Part III empirical results are given for the
production function estimates, the key parameter values relating to
technology differences, and for a simulation analysis which isolates
the existence of technology differences as distinct from scale and

factor price effects. Part IV summarizes the findings.
Like all new lands in the 19th Century, Canada depended upon

foreign investment for development capital. Unlike its neighbor to
the south, Canada did not over time move from the status of net capital

importer to that of net capital exporter; indeed the role of foreign

investment has increased substantially since 1950. This doubtless
contributed to the decline in the public and political welcome accorded
to foreign investment in Canada since the mid—60s, and led to such key

actions as the 1972 study of the Government of Canada known as The Gray
Report, and the subsequent establishment of the Foreign Investment

Review Agency (FIRA) in 1974. The existence of FIRA makes Canada one

2

of only three industrialized countries ——

along with Australia and

Japan — having formal review mechanisms regulating entry of foreign
firms,1 although this in itself by no means implies Canada is effectively less open to foreign investment than other industrial countries.

The debate begun in the 1960s and leading up to the
governmental reviews in the Watkins Report, the Wahn Committee, the
Gray Report, and finally the establishment of FIRA,2 still continues

today. Thus for example, a 1977 study by T. L. Powrie of the
University of Alberta concludes that the benefits to Canada of the
cumulative investment from 1950 to 1976 were equal to only about six
month's of average GNP growth over the period,3 though this has been

disputed by others.4 Inasmuch as the focus of our study is upon the

nature of technological differences in production between domestic
and foreign firms, we will not delve deeply into the debates on the

various aspects of foreign investment in Canada. In this section it
will be our intent only to outline briefly the policy issues found in
this large literature which are most germane to technology effects.

1.1 The Determinants of Foreign Investment in Canada

In the global context two broad lines of analysis on
multinationals are found: first what are the determinants of this
flow of direct investment5; secondly what is the effect of such

investment upon the host country. For the flow among industrial
countries in particular, the work of Vernon provides a well known
summary, whereas the impact upon developing countries——which no doubt

has some unique characteristics——is most recently reviewed by Lall
and Streeten.6

In the case of Canada, several studies have investigated the

determinants of foreign investment.

First, many writers, e.g.

Eastman and Stykolt,7 point to tariff—walls as an incentive to invest

in production in Canada, rather than sell from parent plants (most

often in the U.S.). Secondly, others (Horst and Caves 8) while not
ignoring this effect, emphasize the competitive advantage U.S. firms

possess in the form of product differentiation and R&D. This implies
that the profitability of transferring capital via direct investment
is greater than via portfolio investment, or that the former is more

efficient.9 This is a key point dealing with technology differences

to which our study is addressed, and we return to elaborate the
literature's findings below.
Third, access to resources and raw material supplies continues

to be an important determinant of investment in the 20th Century,

with the predominant role of timber giving way in the inter—war
period to pulp and paper and later minerals. The latter two along
with petroleum became the principal resource attractions after World

War 11.10 Lastly, the degree of scale economies appears to be
closely related to the extent of foreign investment, as concluded by
the Horst and Caves studies,1' and suggested in the factual evidence

of relative firm size: in general, foreign—controlled firms tend to
be larger in size than domestic ones.

In summary, four factors stand out as determinants of foreign

direct investment in Canada:

the tariff—walls; the relative

efficiency of direct over portfolio investment attributable to both

market—competition effects such as product—differentiation and value

of intangible assets from R & D; security of access to natural
resources, and fourth, the effect of scale economies.

1.2. The Impact of Foreign Investment on the Canadian Economy
Foreign investment has been analyzed as affecting the Canadian

economy in the following areas: extraterritorial control of economic
decisions; financial effects; product line and trade pattern effects;
effects on industrial concentration and competitiveness; effects upon

productivity, technology, and efficiency. It is in the last area
that this study will attempt to provide new evidence, hence the other
areas are discussed only briefly in this section.

On the one side, negative effects are well summarized in the
principal government reports of the early seventies (the Watkins, Wahn
and Gray reports, described in Rugman) which emphasized in particular
the notion of extraterritorlality, that is the possibility that production

decisions of Canadian subsidiaries were made by parent offices
outside Canada in a manner inimical to Canadian economic interests.
In addition, they contend there are negative financial effects such

as the lost tax revenue resulting from intra—firm pricing policies

minimizing taxable profits, the increased reliance over time upon
Canadian financial sources for foreign investment, and impacts upon
domestic savings.

Product line and trade—pattern effects are

encapsulated in the term "truncation." This suggests that foreign
firms "copy" nearly the full product line of their parent on a much

smaller scale, resulting in higher unit costs.

Because the

subsidiary produces such a similar line for the Canadian market, it

-

6

is further suggested that the parent will inhibit export by the
subsidiary which would compete with its own output. Also, the tie to

the larger parent is likely to result in more ourchases from
integrated parent company establishments, instead of reliance on
Canadian suppliers.

Truncation incidentally also affects the

technology issues in that the truncated subsidiary will not have a

large R & D effort duplicating the parent. Finally, foreign firms
are said to reduce competition because they tend to be large in size

and result in greater concentration in the given industry. Further,

they are more likely to engage in activities where product

differentiation prevails, which by itself means imperfect
competition.

Safarian'2 gives one of the earliest critiques of the negative

effects of foreign investment, in part pre—dating the government
reports.

He notes that while it is true that product lines of

subsidiaries are "copies" in truncated scale, he argues this is
attributable to the effect of tariffs on competition in Canada, As
for exports and imports, he does not find any empirical evidence for

differences in behavior between Canadian firms and foreign
subsidiaries. On the view that competition is reduced because
foreign firms are larger, the critics agree only that the firms are
larger.

Indeed they also agree that the foreign firms prevail in

areas where product differentiation is important. However, they
dispute the implication that such characteristics are inevitably bad,

McGraw—Hill, 1966, and The Performance of Foreign Owned Firms in
Canada, Canadian—American Committee, 1969.

7

and emphasize that this may have nothing to do with the firms being

foreign, but may be attributable to the lack of competition in
Canada. In addition, Caves'3 points out (though he does not find

support for the thesis) that adding foreign firms can increase
competition, encouraging greater efficiency. Globerman (1979 and
1979a) attempts to measure any such "spillover" effects foreign firms
have upon the productivity of domestic firms, and concludes that they

are small but positive.'4 Of course, his results incorporate not
only the possible effects via increased competition, but any other

spillover effects of a demonstration type: domestic firms observe
and emulate new technologies, new managerial approaches, new product

lines, etc. Indeed, the question of efficiency of production raised

in the degree—of—competition discussion also has a technological
dimension. The effects foreign firms may have upon technology and
resultant productive efficiency, the last group of issues, is what we
focus upon in this paper.

1.3. Review of Previous Analysis on Technology and Efficiency

Technology and efficiency effects of multinational firms in
Canada have three aspects in the existing literature: R & D activities by foreign firms in Canada; the assumption in global analyses
of the net effect of foreign investment that the productivity of a

Productivity in Host Country Markets," Econoinica, May 1974, pp.

Efficiency Benefits in Canadian Manufacturing Industry," Canadian
Journal of Economics, February 1979, pp. 42—56.

foreign dollar is exactly equal to that of a domestic one; and third,
cost and productivity comparisons among domestic, foreign, and parent

firms. The present study will not be able to contribute any new
insights on the first of these, but it will permit a test of the
assumption of equal productivity of investment, and will address
directly the technology comparisons between foreign and domestic
firms in a select group of industries.

There is a concern expressed by the Gray Report that
indigenous development of an R & D capacity is inhibited by the
existence of foreign control of much manufacturing capital. Foreign
subsidiaries, not wishing to duplicate "free" R & D already done by

parents will engage in less R & D than will comparable Canadian
firms.

Pollock15 refers to Canada's dependence on external

technology, noting that 90 percent of patents issued in Canada are

taken out by foreign applicants. But Safarian's study (1969)
concludes that while foreign subsidiaries may do less R & D than

their parents, there is no evidence they do less than resident
firms——indeed the opposite may be true.

Although the question whether, on balance, one gains or loses
from the existence of foreign firms is central to all the debate, few

explicit attempts to quantify this exist. Two such studies have however been done in the past, by Penner in 1966 and by Powrie in 1977,16

'5David Pollock, Canada and the Foreign Firm, Cuadermos de la
Cepal, Santiago, Chile, 1976, pp. 11—12.

'6Rudolph Penner, "The Benefits of Foreign Investment in
Canada, 1950 to 1956," Canadian Journal of Economics and Political
Science, 32, No. 2, May 1966, pp. 172—183, and T.L. Powrie, "The
Contribution of Foreign Capital to Canadian Economic Growth," mimeo,
Department of Economics, University of Alberta, July 1977.

9

both of which conclude that the effect is positive but very small.

In both cases, it is assumed that technology differences between

foreign and domestic capital are non—existent, that is the
productivity of a dollar of investment is the same whether it be in a

domestic firm or a foreign one.

Inasmuch as other evidence on

foreign firms' productivity——described below——suggests they are more

efficient, these assumptions may cause an underestimate in the net

gains. The proposed empirical analysis of this study will permit a
direct test of the hypothesis that marginal product of capital is the
same in both foreign and domestic firms.

Explicit cost and productivity comparisons of foreign and
domestic firms have been undertaken in a number of studies. Safarian

(1966 and 1969) looked expressly at unit costs, but compared only
foreign subsidiaries in Canada with their parents, finding the former

were usually much higher—cost producers. Labor productivity measures

have been done by Raynauld (1972)17 and Globerman (1979a), in both

cases using value—added per worker as the productivity measure.
Raynauld found for 2,000 establishments in Quebec in 1961, the labor

productivity in foreign firms was considerably higher than in

domestic ones. The use of value—added per worker is of course
subject to various criticisms to the effect that differences in this

among firms may be due to industry characteristics, capital use,
labor quantity, etc.

Globerman, notes that without a fuller

understanding of the sources of labor productivity one cannot

conclude that overall factor productivity is higher in foreign—owned firms.
He

attempts to explain labor productivity in different industries

for Canadian firms in a regression analysis using a number of
independent variables including proxies for labor quality, and
capital labor—ratios, scale effects, hours worked, and the degree of
foreign investment as a measure of the "spillovert' benefits we noted
earlier.

As Globerman's principal objective was to measure this

"spillover" effect, he unfortunately did not analyze labor
productivity of foreign firms, precluding any direct comparisons of
the relative productivity of Canadian and foreign—owned firms, it is

the purpose of our analysis to make such a comparison explicitly

using establishment level production data to estimate translog
production functions for Canadian and foreign—owned firms in the same
industry.

II. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION MODEL
In the estimation of production models the standard hypothesis

is that the production function belongs to a restricted class which

satisfies the a priori restrictions of positive monotonicity and

quasiconcavity on factor inputs (see especially Nadiri18), The
production functions most frequently used are the Cobb—Douglas, the

CES, and the translog, the last being a more recent development

M.D. Intriligator (eds.), Handbook of Mathematical Economics,
Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Company.

11

(Christensen, Jorgensen, and Lau)9 Each of these functions imply
different restrictions in the properties of the technology. The
Cobb—Douglas function restricts all Allen partial elasticities of

substitution to be equal to one. The CES function restricts the
above elasticities to be constant and equal for any pair of inputs

and for all points in input space. In addition, both the Cobb—

Douglas and the CES functions assume strong separability. The
translog function, on the other hand, does not restrict the values of
the elasticity of substitution at any point in input space; moreover,

it does not assume strong separability. Therefore, the substitution
possibilities depend on the level of all inputs.

The estimation of translog functions has become very popular
lately for the flexibility that it provides (Berndt and Christensen;

Berndt and Wood; Humphrey and Moroney).2° All these studies use a
translog function with three inputs having nine regressors besides
the constant,2' (or ten including Hicks neutral technological

change). To avoid multicollinearity problems and to increase the

size of the sample, the usual estimation procedure has been to work
with side conditions for profit maximization in competitive product

and factor markets. Under this assumption, side conditions for
profit maximization imply a system of semi—logarithmic equations with

one equation for each input. Each of these equations gives the cost
share of an input as a linear function of the logs of each of the inputs.

Problems of estimating a translog production function come from a
decision as to how much information should be utilized. Three choices are
available:

(1) Estimating the production function by itself.

(2) Estimating the parameters of the production function using
only the side order conditions.

(3) Estimating the parameters of the production function using
both the production function and the side order conditions
simultaneously.

Methods (1) and (3) both require data on output.

Consequently,

studies using macro data will typically run into aggregation problems

in constructing a measure of output.22 Similarly, for time series

analysis, methods (1) and (3) require an explicit structure for
technological change, even in the Hicks—neutral case.

It can be argued that more efficient estimates may be obtained

by using the full information system (3) compared to the limited

Several Kinds of Output," Journal of Political Economy, 81,4,
878—892.

Intriligator and D. Kendrick (eds.), Frontiers of Quantitative
Economics, Vol. II, Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Company.

13

information alternatives (1) and (2). Of course, as with any full
information method, we can be confident of obtaining more efficient
estimates only as long as the assumptions used to derive the system

of equations are true. If they are not, a specification error is
introduced which will have unknown consequences on the properties of
our estimates.

In particular, it is impossible to know if the

parameters that one is estimating are those of a translog function,
or a spurious set resulting from misspecification introduced by the
use of untested and incorrect assumptions.

The advantages of method (2) vis—a—vis method (1) is that it
reduces the problem of multicollinearity and increases the effective
sample size.

This, however, is done at the cost of making

assumptions on firm behavior and market structure which are usually
untested.

Since method (3) incorporates the same assumptions (and

"advantages") of method (2) as well as incorporating additional
information on the structure of the production function which have

been assumed but not used, method (3) is always more advantageous
than method (2), if the specification of the production function is

correct (especially the measure of output and the specification of
the Hicks neutral technical change variable).

Corbo and Meller23 have used method (1) to estimate a translog
function, for individual four—digit ISIC industries, in Chile using a

cross—section of firms. Method (2) was initiated by Berndt and

Corbo and P. Meller, "The Translog Production Function:
Some Evidence from Establishment Data," Journal of Econometrics,
10,2, 193—199, 1979, and V.Corbo, and P. Meller, "The Substitution of
Labor, "Skill" and Capital in Chilean Manufacturing," Estudios de
Economia, 1979.

Christensen (op. cit.) and has been used extensively since (see for

example: Berndt and Wood (op. cit.), Humphrey and Moroney (op.
cit.), Fuss, Moroney and Toevs, Pindyck.24 Surprisingly enough,
the postulated hypothesis that the production function is of the
translog variety, which was used in the derivation of the equations
(side order conditions), was not included in the system of equations
estimated.

Method (3)——the inclusion of the production function with the
share equations——was suggested by Diewert (op. cit.) as a method for

obtaining efficient estimates, it has been applied by Burgess and
Appelbaum using the aggregate U.S. data of Berndt and Christensen;

Brown, Caves and Christensen have used it in the context of a
multiple output cost function on a cross—section of U.S. railroad
data; and Breslaw, Corbo and Smith in the context of a firm.

In this study, we use Method (3) given its various advantages
over the other two methods. We assume that within each four—digit
SIC manufacturing industry and for a given ownership status all

establishments use the same technology. We assume further that firms

are cost minimizers subject to a transiog technology.

Thus, we

assume that the observations on putput and inputs are generated from
the following model:

where Y is value of production, L is iabor, N is materials, K is

index of a firm within the ith industry.

In equation (1) we are assuming that every establishment
within a four—digit SIC industry, independent of size and other

characteristics, has the same production function.

However,

recalling that in a translog function the elasticity of substitution
is different at every data point, the size of the establishment will
affect the substitution properties of the technology.

The hypothesis of constant returns to scale can be tested
directly from (1).

Constant returns to scale imply the following

restrictions on the parameters of this function for sector I (E.
Berndt and L. Christensen, 1973, p. 84).

With symmetry imposed a priori, restrictions (iii) and (iv)
are not independent of (1) and (ii). Therefore, we test for constant
returns to scale in model (1) by imposing constraints (i) and (ii) on
the parameters.

A production function is considered to be well—behaved if it
has positive marginal products for each input (monotonicity) and if

it is quasi concave. The translog function does not satisfy these
restrictions globally. Still, if we can find wide enough regions in
input space (including the observed input combination) where these
restrictions are satisfied, we can consider the translog function as

well—behaved for relevant input combinations.

To do this,

monotonicity and quasi—concavity of the estimated translog function
must be checked at every data point in the sample.

Monotonicity requires aY/L >

Using these expressions, we compute the relevant partial
derivatives, given a set of parameter values, for each sample point

of input and output values, in order to check for monotonicity. The

translog function is strictly quasi—concave (strictly convex
isoquants) if the bordered Hessian matrix is negative definite. In
the case of three inputs this requires the bordered principal minors
to be positive and negative respectively.26

The system formed by equations (1), (2)

and (3)

is estimated

jointly as a system of seemingly unrelated equations.
The estimated coefficient values of equation (1) are then used

to calculate the usual production parameters: marginal factor
productivities; factor elasticities; substitution elasticities;
factor ratios; and average and marginal costs.

Furthermore, the

coefficients are used to simulate optimal factor ratios for given
different values of output scale and factor prices. This procedure
permits one to do two things. First, we can separate the effects of

technology differences, scale, and factor—prices upon the optimal
ratios of capital to labor, as well as materials to labor. Figure 1
illustrates this procedure for a comparison between Canadian—owned
and TJ.S.—owned firms, where it is supposed there is a difference in
technology between the two, with U.S. firms (for convenience, we will
use the terms "U.S. firms" and "Canadian firms" to denote the country

of ownership) producing on average at higher levels of output (AQU)

than Canadian ones (AQC), facing relatively higher wage—rental
ratios, and using relatively higher capital—labor ratios (k* compared
to k *).

c

If

U.S. firms are then assumed to face Canadian—firm factor

prices and produce at Canadian scales but using "U.S." technology,

the result would be production on isoquant AQC at a capital—labor
ratio k *c, lower than k * but still higher than k *• This reflects
u
U
c
the fact that the technology used by U.S. firms is still more capital

intensive than that used by Canadian firms, even at the same lower
Canadian—firm scale and with similar factor prices. This is done for

actual coefficient values by using U.S.—firm coefficients as in
equation (1), Canadian output levels and factor—input prices, and

solving the system of equations for the three inputs:

capital,

labor, raw materials, to arrive at a cost—minimizing combination.

Secondly, the simulation of the optimal values k* for each
ownership category also allows one to judge "efficiency." The closer

actual k values are to k* the more "efficient" the firms in the
industry. One can therefore observe whether U.S.—owned firms and

more "efficient" than Canadian—owned ones by comparing (kt1 — k*)
for certain groups.

III. DATA AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS

111.1. Production Function Estimates

The basic units of information are production data for an
establishment as defined in the Canadian Manufacturing Census, in the

years 1972 and 1975. The number of establishments varies by industry

and by ownership. In table 1 we present for 1972 the number of
establishments in the census in the different industries considered
in this study.27

The definitions of the input variables used in our estimations
are as follows:

0 =

Quantity

index of production: measured as the current

value of production divided by the industry selling
price index.

L = Number of man hours of production workers equivalent:

defined as the sum of wages and salaries divided by the
wage rate of production workers.

M Quantity index of raw materials: Current dollar values
divided by a sector specific price index of raw materials.

K =

Capital

Services: measured as proportional to the

constant dollar consumption of fuel and electricity. The
factor of proportionally (0) is estimated jointly ith he
other parameters in the systems of equation (1) to (3).

27The data used is from a special subset of the Census in
which ownership of an establishment is flagged. We are grateful to
Statistics Canada for their permission to use results of regressions

run on this data set, and especially to John McVey for his
cooperation and assistance in the analysis.

The whole system was estimated using the non—linear least
squares (NLLSO) estimating procedure. A difficulty with the use of
NLLSQ is that the regressors (the factor quantities) are endogenous

variables for an establishment within an industry. Failure to take
account of this will introduce contemporaneous correlation between
the regressors and the random error of the individual equations (the

simultaneity problem). In such a case the NLLSQ estimates of
equations (1) to (3) are biased and inconsistent.

Consistent

estimates could be obtained by using a nonlinear instrumental
variable (NLIV) estimator; however, in cross section analysis the
usual instruments——lagged values of the explanatory variables——are
usually so correlated with the variables for which they are serving

as instruments that the NLLSQ and NLIV results are not very
different.28 Therefore, we have estimated our model using NLLSQ.
Due to differences in the size of individual establishments

within an industry the problem of heteroscedasticity could arise.

the context of time series estimates of an aggregate
production function for the manufacturing sector the same result was
found by E. Berndt and L. Christensen (1973, Tables 4, 6, 7).

24

This is minimized in our estimation procedure because we work with
all the variables scaled in such a way that their means are equal to
one.

In table 2 we present the results obtained for the point
estimation of equations (1), (2) and (3). The results overall are
very good, most of the cross terms are highly significant and thus we

encounter no problem in the estimation of elasticities of
substitution and other parameters of the technology. One exception

the inability to estimate coefficients for U.S.—owned

occurs:

bakeries.

111.2 Comparison of Technology Parameters: U.S. and Canadian Firms
Table 3 presents the calculated values of seven production—

related parameters for the seven industries other than
1072——Bakeries, for Canadian— and U.S.—owned firms.29 These enable
one to "test" some of the hypotheses from the literature reviewed in

Section 11.3 above, at least in an indicative way based on this
limited sample.

In general, it is thought unit costs are lower in U.S. firms
(Safarian, 1966 and 1969). If one considers marginal costs, this is
true only in three cases (1081, 2860, and 3320), in two others costs

being the same (3042 and 3360), while in the three others,
Canadian—owned firms have lower costs. Note also that for two of the

industries where U.S. firms have lower marginal costs——1081 and
3320——the sample size for U.S. firms is very small. Much the same
conclusion emerges looking at average costs, for which we find U.S.

29Other foreign—owned firms are excluded since in most cases
the sample size is quite small.

firms are lower cost in four of seven industries. Thus, it would

appear from our estimates that U.S.—owned firms are by no means
consistently lower—cost producers.

Analyses of overall benefit—cost effects of foreign ownership
as done by Penner, and later Powrie, assumes a dollar of investment

by U.S. or Canadian firms results in equal output. Again, our
parameter values cast doubt on the generality of this assumption, as
we observe that the elasticity of output with respect to capital is
greater in U.S.—owned firms in

four of seven cases. That this

is not affected very much by scale effects is clear from a comparison

of the scale elasticity values. In all cases but one, the scale
effect is almost exactly the same in Canadian and U.S.—owned firms.
We emphasize again the limited size of this sample, as a consequence

of which our conclusions cannot readily be generalized.

However,

from this sample it would appear that the effect of a dollar
investment is in some industries higher for U.S.—owned firms, and in

other industries it is higher in Canadian—owned ones, and that
therefore in aggregate. assuming overall equal effects may not be
unreasonable, but it is more correct to look at specific industries.

Another hypothesis reviewed earlier stated that in general

labor productivity is higher in U.S.—owned firms.

Production

function coefficients permit one to measure labor productivity not

simply as a value—added labor input ratio, but as the basic
theoretical concept of marginal product of labor, ceteris paribus.

30

Again, our (admittedly limited) test casts some doubt on the
conventional hypothesis. We find the marginal product of labor is
higher in only four of seven cases, a "majority" but by no means a

clear reflection of the conventional view.

Our test of the

hypothesis is of course as much a statement about the
inappropriateness of using simple output:labor ratios to measure

labor productivity as it is a rejection of the view that labor
productivity is higher in U.S.—owned firms.

Related to this issue is the hypothesis of Globerman that
there may be spillover effects on the productivity of Canadian—owned
firms, which

are greater the higher the degree of ownership In an industry.

Globerman's empirical test of this had two shortcomings: first, he

did not actually measure labor productivity in U.S. vs Canadian

firms; and secondly, he used the simpler partial productivity
measure, output:labor ratio. For the seven industries studied here,

no confirmation of this hypothasis is found.

If such spillovers

existed, we should expect some positive correlation between the ratio

of Canadian marginal product of labor to U.S. marginal product of
labor, and the degree of U.S. ownership. That is, we might expect
Canadian productivity to be closer to U.S. productivity where foreign

ownership was greatest. In fact, if anything, the correlation is
slightly negative, as can be easily observed in Panel B of Table 3.
Though by no means a refutation of Globerman's spillover hypothesis,
this certainly does not give it strong support.

The last two parameters in Panel A of Table 3 are "Share of

Energy/Share of Labor," a proxy for capital—labor ratios, and

"Average Output" shown as log of value. As is well documented

31

elsewhere, U.S.—owned firms are generally larger, and are usually
thought to be more capital intensive.

In all seven industries,

U.S.—owned firms are indeed larger, and the proxy for capital—labor
is greater in all but one instance, and this last case the estimates

shown had standard deviations equal to about half of the mean. But

it is by no means clear that this is universally associated with

lower marginal or average costs, or with greater capital
productivity, or greater scale economy effects, or greater labor
productivity. Our results only confirm that U.S. firms more often
than not have higher "productivity" or lower "costs," but there are

many instances of the reverse situations, suggesting at the very

least that the supposed superiority of U.S. firms is far from
universal.

111.3 Simulation Analysis of Technology Differences: Canadian and
U.S.—Owned Firms

Following the procedure described earlier for simulating
optimal (i.e. least—cost) factor—input levels in each industry, given

outputs and technological coefficients of the system of equations
(1), (2), (3), we present here a comparison of Canadian—owned and
U.S.—owned firms.

First, optimal inputs are simulated for

Canadian—owned and U.S.—owned firms separately using own scale and
factor—price levels.

The resulting capital—labor ratio values are

shown as k * and k * in Table 4. Then we simulate the optimal factor
C
U

ratio U.S. firms would use if they were to produce at the
Canadian—firm scale and face the factor prices of Canadian firms but
used their own technology as reflected in the parameters of Table 2.

The resulting capital—labor ratio is shown as kc. The difference
between k * and k * is assumed to be attributable to three factors:
C
U

scale effects upon technology, different factor prices, and
technology differences. The simulated ratio k*C incorporates the
scale and factor—price effects, hence the difference between this

value and the value k* is due only to technology differences. With
this, we can test directly the hypothesis that U.S.—owned firms use
different technologies from Canadian—owned firms.

Before we discuss these results, a very brief digression on

different factor prices is appropriate. Although this possibility

contradicts the fundamental assumption of a homogeneous factor
market, it is by no means an uncommonly observed phenomenon with
regard to multi—national subsidiaries, especially in small economies.

Lower capital costs are often alleged to prevail in foreign—owned

firms because they are thought to have access to larger pools of
parent—company capital and/or credit—worthiness. This can of course
sometimes go in the opposite direction, namely that the larger parent

firm may,

elsewhere in the world, have better profit—making

opportunities than the subsidiary in question, in effect making the
global internal opportunity cost of capital higher, despite the lower

supply—price resulting from larger capital pools. Although this
alone justifies assuming different wage—rental ratios, there is also
sometimes an argument that multinationals willingly pay higher wages
than the going market rate, in order to try to attract the best labor

34

and to act in a way favorable to their image as good corporate
citizens of the host country.3°

Simulated capital—labor ratios using own

factor

prices and

scale levels show much the same picture as the proxy parameter "Share
of Energy/Share of Labor" in Table 3.

In the majority of industries

four Canadian—owned firms have lower capital—labor ratio values, in

one industry it is about the same, and in two cases Canadian ratios
are higher. The simulated optimal values correspond closely with the

actual measured ratios, indicating both the reasonableness of the
methodology of estimation and the fact that firms are, on average,
efficient in the sense of being on the isoquant optimality point.31

The one exception to this is industry 2513 (Sawmills), where the

proxy measure of actual capital—labor ratio used (Share of
energy/Share of labor) shows U.S.—owned firms have higher
capital—intensity, whereas the optimal ratio simulated shows they are

very slightly lower.32
If we consider next what happens to the capital—labor ratio of

U.S. firms when Canadian—firm scale and factor prices apply, we
observe what appear at first to be anomalies, but in fact reflect a

30These arguments are discussed for developing countries in
Lall and Streeten, op. cit., as well as for Canada in S. Kardacz,

320f the twenty—one simulations done, this was the only one
that gave a local solution only, rather than a global one. Thus,
the values shown in Table 4 may not be a correct representation, due
to an econometric convergence problem.

35

point made earlier: that wage—rental ratios are not always higher
for U.S.—owned firms. In only two cases do we find the results that

conventional wisdom on U.S. firms in Canada leads one to expect: a

higher capital intensity in U.S. firms, and a higher wage—rental
ratio, resulting in a lowering of ku values, part of the way, when
Canadian scale and factor prices are applied. These are industries,
3042 (Metal Stamping) and 3360 (Electrical Industrial Equipment).

In two other instances, 1832 (Throwsters and Yarns), and 2860
(Commercial Printing), while U.S. firms have higher k ratios, these
rise when Canadian scale and factor prices are applied. For 2860, this
results because the wage—rental ratio is found to be lower for U.S.—

owned firms (3.45 compared to 4.03). This fact is somewhat unexpected
and differs from the situation of most other industries where U.S.

firms have higher wage—rental ratios. In the other industry, the
higher U.S. capital—labor ratio rises imperceptibly from 2.99 to 3.04.
This may not signify a true difference, but taking this at face value,

we

observe that this happens despite a marginally higher wage—rental

ratio. Such a relationship implies the

existence of a non—homothetic

production function for U.S.—owned firms, with the expansion path

concave to the L—axis. If such is the case, it clearly suggests a
distinctly different technology, although as noted the movement may
not be statistically significant.

Finally, in three other instances, Canadian—owned firms have
higher capital—labor ratios, and simulated U.S. ratios fall in two
cases (1081 Confectionary, and 3320 Major Appliances), while rising

36

slightly in the third (2513 Sawmills). For the first two, Canadian
wage—rental ratios are distinctly lower, explaining the fall in

U.S. ratios. For the third case, wage—rental ratios are also lower
for Canadian—owned firms; however, the simulations for this industry
were troublesome, as noted, giving only a local solution to the system
of equations, and, in any event, the differences in k values are quite
small.

Last, we turn to analyze Table 4 values as to what they imply

about the existence of technology differences. In general, we find
only one industry where the simulated k value, incorporating scale
and technology effects, eliminates the difference between initial k

values; with the conclusion that no technology differences exist.

This industry is 1832, for which the simulated results are first
statistically questionable, and second, the initial k values are not

very different in any event. Thus, for this industry, we observe
that own price and scale cost—minimization gives capital—labor ratios

of 2.45 for Canadian—owned firms and 2.36 for U.S.—owned firms, a

difference of less than 5 percent. Applying Canadian levels and
factor prices to U.S. technology raises the U.S. k value to 2.47, for

all intents and purposes, the same as the Canadian one. Given the
technical problem of this simulation, and the small differences in

capital—intensity, this would not appear to be a valid case of
similar production technology.

For the other six industries, on the other hand, initial
k—ratio differences are substantial, and simulated values do not, in
any instance, close more than 12 percent of the gap (Industry 3042,

37

where the simulation closes 0.19 of the 1.76 gap). Indeed, for three
industries (Confectionary, Commercial Printing, and Major Appliances)

the gap between k and k opens, implying that technology differences
account for more than 100 percent of the actual observed differences
in k—ratios, and that the effects of scale and factor prices are to

reduce the observed gap, vis—a—vis the true technology gap. In one
case, Throwsters and Yarns, no perceptible change occurs under the
simulation, which can be interpreted as saying that the entire difference in observed optimal ratios of capital to labor is attributable
to differences in technology.

IV. CONCLUSION
Many earlier studies of differences between foreign—owned and
Canadian—owned firms have been done and whatever their conclusions on

the desirability of foreign investment, most contribute to the
conventional wisdom that foreign—owned (usually U.S.—owned) firms,
are larger, more capital intensive, have higher labor productivity,

and have lower costs of production. This is often stated in
capsule form as saying they are more "efficient." Using the translog
production function, we estimate for seven four—digit industries in

Canada, separate production function for U.S. owned and
Canadian—owned firms, and find evidence to dispute several of these
views.

While it does appear clear that U.S.—owned firms are larger,
it is less clear that they are more capital—intensive, only four of
seven industries exhibiting this characteristic. Given our limited
coverage, this conclusion is, of course, open to doubt. However, the

results for other characteristics do show more strongly that the

38

conventional wisdom cannot be simply accepted. U.S.—owned firms are
by no means consistently lower cost producers (as measured by
marginal cost) nor do they consistently have a higher marginal product
of labor.

Further, in the four clear cases of industries where U.S. firms
use higher capital—labor ratios, some of this difference is found to
be reduced by accounting for differences in scale and factor prices,

though in soma cases the difference is in fact increased. The sum
effect of controlling for scale and factor prices is to show that, in

four of seven industries, U.S.—owned firms have technologies with
higher capital—intensity in one, equal in four, and lower in two.
The most important implication of this is that while there are differences in the technology of U.S.—owned and Canadian firms, it is not
necessarily the U.S.—owned firms which have more capital—intensive

technologies. For some industries it is in fact the Canadian firms
that operate with the more capital—intensive technology.

One last conclusion is coincidentally reached: we find no
evidence in our analysis for the Globerman hypothesis that "technological spillover" occurs within an industry from U.S.—owned to
Canadian—owned firms.

To conclude, then, the simulation analysis strongly supports
the

position that U.S.—owned firms and Canadian—owned firms operate

with different technologies. It
than

is

perhaps these differences, rather

some notion of "efficiency," that underlie much of the conven-

tional findings about larger scale, more productive labor, higher

capital intensity, and lower unit costs. Indeed, we have not

39

found strong support for any of these commonly noted hypotheses once

all production factors are fully incorporated into a trans—log

production function. We suspect this is not a random result
attributable to the limited sample in our analysis, rather, it
reflects the erroneous partial definitions of productivity and costs

used in earlier studies, most of which necessarily relied on
averages, partial productivity measures, and single observations of a

variable which reflects a variety of economic phenomena.

The

production function analysis has permitted a clean—cut distinction of

various influences, allowing one to calculate efficiency marginal

costs, ceteris—paribus productivities of labor rather than the
catch—all mutatis—mutandis value generally used, and to isolate the

existence of technology differences separately from the effects of

scale and factor prices.33 We conclude that the only clear—cut
distinctions between IJ.S.—owned and Canadian—owned firms are the
scale of production, and differences in production technology.

33Working at four—digit SIC with establishment data does not
automatically eliminate all problems of product—line differences, but
it clearly goes much farther in this respect than other studies have
done. Short of a far more massive effort of product—line production
functions——in practice, made impossible by lack of data in Canada or
elsewhere we cannot see how much more can be done to account for
hetrogeneity in econometric analysis.
