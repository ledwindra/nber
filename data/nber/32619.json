    "abstract": "\n\nSocial movements are catalysts for crucial institutional changes. To succeed, they must coordinate members\u2019 views (consensus building) and actions (mobilization). We study union leaders within Myanmar\u2019s burgeoning labor movement. Union leaders are positively selected on both personality traits that enable them to influence others and ability but earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers\u2019 views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union\u2019s preferred policy. In an experiment that mimics individual decision-making in a collective action set-up, leaders increase mobilization through coordination. Leaders empower social movements by building consensus that encourages mobilization.\n\n",
