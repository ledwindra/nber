Using RCTs to Estimate Long-Run Impacts in Development Economics

NBER Working Paper No. 25356
December 2018
JEL No. I32,I38,O12,O15,O16
ABSTRACT
We assess evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) on long-run economic productivity
and living standards in poor countries. We ˝first document that several studies estimate large
positive long-run impacts, but that relatively few existing RCTs have been evaluated over the
long-run. We next present evidence from a systematic survey of existing RCTs, with a focus on
cash transfer and child health programs, and show that a meaningful subset can realistically be
evaluated for long-run effects. We discuss ways to bridge the gap between the burgeoning
number of development RCTs and the limited number that have been followed up to date,
including through new panel (longitudinal) data, improved participant tracking methods,
alternative research designs, and access to administrative, remote sensing, and cell phone data.
We conclude that the rise of development economics RCTs since roughly 2000 provides a novel
opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the long-run drivers of living standards.

INTRODUCTION

Development economics is an eclectic and methodologically rich field, featuring important contributions that utilize cross-country data, historical information, administrative records, and, increasingly, original survey data to understand the determinants of long-run living standards in poor
countries. The roles played by human capital investments, well-functioning credit markets, and
cash transfers have figured prominently in debates within the field (Gennaioli et al., 2012; Banerjee
et al., 2015c; Haushofer & Shapiro, 2016), as have specific programs and policies that combine
elements of these and other approaches (Banerjee et al., 2015b). Notably, development economists
have also pioneered novel field experimental methods over the past twenty years, carrying out thousands of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), often in close collaboration with low-income country
governments and non-governmental organizations.
This review article surveys what we have learned about the determinants of long-run living
standards from this growing body of RCTs in development economics, and argues that these studies
provide an exceptional opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the impacts of a range of
international development interventions on economic productivity and living standards.
For quantitative evidence on the rapid increase in the use of RCTs in development economics
over the past 20 years, Figure 1 presents the cumulative number of registered RCTs in development
economics conducted from 1995 to 2015 from the American Economic Association RCT Registry1 .
These data are likely to be lower bounds on the total number of relevant studies, since not all RCTs
are registered, but the patterns in the data remain clear. Following influential early RCTs, such
as the Mexico PROGRESA study (Skoufias & McClafferty, 2001), the Kenya deworming study
(Miguel & Kremer, 2004) and the early education studies described in Kremer (2003), there was a
surge in the use of RCTs in development economics in the decade of the 2000’s. The data indicate
that cash transfer programs and health interventions constitute a large share of these studies2 . Our
impression as researchers active in the field is that the pace of new RCTs in development economics
has only accelerated since 2015.
The timing of this surge in development economics RCTs opens up an intriguing possibility: it
has been roughly twenty years since these early interventions from the late 1990’s and early 2000’s
were conducted, allowing researchers to begin to assess truly long-run impacts. For child health
and education programs, beneficiaries in the early RCTs are now adults, allowing an assessment
of long-run impacts on labor productivity, consumption, and living standards. Given the large
numbers of RCTs launched in the 2000’s, every year that goes by means that more and more RCT
studies are “aging into” a phase where the assessment of long-run impacts becomes possible.
Beyond the opportunity presented by early RCTs in development economics, there are also
many RCTs conducted by researchers in international public health that are promising. Figure 2
presents the cumulative number of RCT studies in the cash transfer and child health areas that
1

Data were extracted from the AEA Registry (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org) on August 1, 2018. We
extracted studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries, according to World Bank definitions. We focused
on completed studies, and do not include RCTs that are ongoing, in the design phase, or withdrawn. This database
is not comprehensive since study registration only became the norm around a decade after RCTs became common in
development economics, and registration is voluntary; that said, many research institutions and journals are actively
promoting registration of both ongoing and completed studies. We omit counts after 2015 since most such studies
are ongoing.

We considered a trial to be in the cash transfer or health category if its abstract contains the keyword “cash

have been published in both public health and economics journals, from the AidGrade database3 .
It is apparent that experimental research methods were widely adopted at least a decade earlier in
public health (and related fields) than in economics, and that public health features an even larger
body of evidence in terms of the raw count of studies.
Several of these studies generated exogenous variation in child nutrition and health that have
already laid the groundwork for long-run evaluations. For instance, the famous INCAP child
nutrition experiment in Guatemala was initiated in 1969 by public health researchers (Martorell
et al., 1995), and 35 years later, economists followed up on the original sample and estimate
significant gains in male wages, improved cognitive skills, and even some positive inter-generational
effects (Hoddinott et al., 2008; Behrman et al., 2009; Maluccio et al., 2009), as we detail below.
Some early studies have the advantage of observing truly long-term changes, and have generated invaluable insights into the economic mechanisms underlying program effects, as well as
documenting broader technological and institutional changes. Back in 1974–75, Christopher Bliss
and Nicholas Stern led an extraordinary data collection effort in an Indian village, Palanpur. Along
with other researchers, they surveyed this village intensively across several decades, and documented
how lives and livelihoods changed from the 1970s to today, including local experiences with the
Green Revolution and intensification of agriculture, structural transformation and increasing market integration (Lanjouw et al., 2018). A limitation of these early studies is their relatively small
sample size of households and focus on a specific geographic region.
Another route to assess long-term program or policy impacts that has been more common
is to exploit natural experiments. This strategy is common in the economic history literature.
For instance, Bleakley (2007) exploits the introduction of a hookworm-eradication campaign in
the U.S. South, combined with the cross-area differences in pretreatment infection rates, to form
an identification strategy, and shows that the eradication campaign had long-lasting impacts on
income and return to schooling. Similarly, Acemoglu & Johnson (2007) exploit the international
epidemiological transition, which led to potentially exogenous differential changes in mortality
from tuberculosis, pneumonia, malaria, and various other diseases; countries with larger baseline
disease burden thus experience a larger reduction in mortality. Using predicted mortality as an
instrument for life expectancy, the authors estimated the effects of life expectancy on population
and GDP. Almond (2006) alternatively exploits the timing of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which
arrived unexpectedly in the fall of 1918 and had largely subsided by January 1919, and shows large
negative educational and labor market effects on cohorts in utero during the pandemic. Evidence
from natural experiments are particularly compelling when the policy or program variation studied
is truly random. Bleakley & Ferrie (2013), for example, take advantage of the 1832 Cherokee Land
Lottery in the state of Georgia, to assess the long-term impact of large shocks to wealth. These
studies have provided valuable insights into the long-term impacts of various cash transfer or health
interventions, but natural experiments such as these are hard to come by. Rich historical census
or other records are also necessary for researchers to link participants’ treatment status to later
outcomes, and those records tend to be less available in low-income contexts.
Changes from natural policy variations have also made it possible for researchers to study longrun impacts of cash transfer and child health interventions in wealthy countries. This literature
3
We extracted data from the AidGrade project (http://www.aidgrade.org) in August 2018. AidGrade is a metaanalysis database focusing on 10 types of development aid programs. Notably, they use a somewhat different definition
of sector than ours: they restrict attention to health interventions in deworming, HIV/AIDS education, micronutrients, school meals, bed nets, safe water storage, and water treatment, and not all studies focus specifically on
children.

in general shows large, positive and persistent effects of such programs; while we briefly discuss it
here, the extensive literature in high-income countries is not the focus of this article, and we refer
interested readers to the recent surveys in Almond et al. (2017) and Hoynes & Schanzenbach (2018).
In the United States, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program has been shown to improve
beneficiaries’ academic achievement, education attainment, employment and earnings in the long
run (Chetty et al., 2011b; Bastian & Michelmore, 2018). Bastian & Michelmore (2018) estimate
that an additional $1,000 in EITC exposure when a child is 13–18 years old increases adult earnings
by 2.2%, with the primary channel being induced increases in pretax family earnings. Similarly, the
Food Stamp Program improved child health in the medium run (East, 2018), reduced metabolic
syndrome conditions such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in adulthood, and increased longterm education and earnings for women (Hoynes et al., 2016). The U.S. Mothers’ Pension program
implemented during 1911–1935 benefited the male children of the recipients up to 70 years later:
the program increased longevity by one year, reduced the probability of being underweight by
half, increased educational attainment by 0.34 years, and increased income in early adulthood by
14% on average, all substantial gains (Aizer et al., 2016). A notable exception is the Seattle-Denver
Income Maintenance Experiment, which did not appear to generate long-run benefits (Price & Song,
2016). Public health interventions in the U.S., especially in early childhood, also generate longrun gains. For instance, the successful hookworm-eradication campaign in the American South
increased school enrollment, attendance, literacy and income roughly 30 years later (Bleakley,
2007)4 . Many of these studies exploit large-scale policy changes and leverage rich administrative
data and census records, which are often not readily available in poor countries. As a result, much
of the evidence from development economics that we survey in this article relies on original data
collection, often including household surveys.
The remainder of this article proceeds as follows.
Section 2 summarizes and evaluates the growing body of evidence from RCTs on the long-term
impacts of international development interventions, and finds that most (though not all) provide
evidence for positive and meaningful effects on individual economic productivity and living standards. Most of these studies examine existing cash transfer, child health, or education interventions,
and shed light on important theoretical questions such as the existence of poverty traps (Bandiera
et al., 2018) and returns to human capital investments in the long term. One notable pattern in
the existing body of evidence is the finding that impacts often differ substantially by respondent
gender, arguably as a result of the different educational and labor market opportunities facing
females and males in most low-income countries. Another is that several existing human capital
investment programs, in both health and education, appear to have high rates of return, making
them potentially attractive for public policy. We observe some heterogeneity in rates of returns for
different age cohorts, echoing the literature on the attractiveness of early childhood interventions
(Heckman, 2006), but we note that interventions targeting kids already in school often present high
returns. We caution that the studies we summarized may not be representative of all the relevant
interventions, because projects that attract enough interest and resources for long-term evaluations
can be selected on certain traits by both researchers and donors. Many of these characteristics are
unobservable and not well understood, thereby potentially generating publication biases.
4
Early childhood interventions such as the Perry Preschool project lead to increases in high school graduation
and college attendance rates, and some positive impacts on economic outcomes, criminal behavior, drug use, and
marriage for women (Anderson, 2008). The Head Start program significantly reduced child mortality rates (Ludwig
& Miller, 2007), and improved long-term education and health, closing one-third of the gap between children with
median and bottom quartile family income (Deming, 2009).

5

Section 3 implements a systematic survey exercise and evaluates which existing randomized
controlled trials are likely to be amenable to long-term follow-up research, with a particular focus
on cash transfer and child health programs, which as we have shown are particularly abundant in the
literature. We first consulted existing meta-analysis and survey articles and extracted hundreds
of existing experimental studies in these two areas. We then implemented a rigorous screening
procedure to identify the studies that could feasibly — and productively — be followed up in future
research, after accounting for research design and data challenges, such as a lack of statistical power,
high attrition rates or differential attrition across treatment arms, and phase-in designs that dampen
cross-arm differences in program exposure. Fortunately, even after screening, we identify dozens of
existing RCTs in the cash transfer and child health areas that appear to be attractive candidates
for long-term follow-up studies today, where we typically use a follow-up period of roughly a decade
to mean the long-run. We view this identification of studies that appear promising for long-run
evaluation as a public good for the development economics research community.
Section 4 presents a methodological discussion on promising approaches to estimating long-term
impacts, both among existing RCTs as well as approaches that can be taken prospectively to make
long-run follow-up surveys more successful. We first discuss the assumptions under which it is
possible to identify long-run treatment effects using a phase-in research design. We provide lessons
from our experience in conducting long-term tracking studies, as well as innovative data approaches.
An important methodological question is whether it is worthwhile to conduct follow-up research for
RCTs that demonstrated limited short-run impacts, or whether it is safe to assume that any effects
fade out in such cases. We discuss evidence from several existing studies that long-run impacts may
exist even in the absence of clear-cut short-run effects. There are plausible conceptual reasons for
such a pattern: if education and experience are complements in the labor market, the magnitude
of program impacts can grow over time (Brunello & Comi, 2004). Policies aimed at improving
education can even have negative impacts on beneficiaries’ labor market outcomes in the short
term, as they may remain in school or in training, or they may experience a longer job-searching
period as they search for certain jobs (such as jobs in the public sector or formal sector). In such
cases, the absence of long-run evidence could lead to the erroneous conclusion that the benefits
of a human capital investment are small. The need for truly long-run labor market data may be
particularly important for females, who often have lower labor market attachment during peak
child-bearing years, before fully re-entering the labor force in mid-life.
Section 5 discusses the implications of this evidence for development economics. We conclude
that the rise of development RCTs over the past two decades provides an exciting opportunity for
scientific progress, by generating credible evidence on the determinants of living standards over
the long-run. We predict and hope that the trickle of early studies that exploit RCTs to generate
long-run evidence will become a flood in the coming years.

WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED? A REVIEW OF THE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE

Relatively little is currently known about the long-run impacts of many common interventions in
international development. A systematic review by the World Bank (Tanner et al., 2015) focusing
on early childhood interventions was able to identify only a single study that reported later employment and labor market outcomes (Gertler et al., 2014). Contemporaneous work by Molina Millán
et al. (2018a) focusing on conditional cash transfers also concludes that very few studies are able
6

to confidently assess the later employment and labor market impacts of the transfers, as many
beneficiaries are still in school and not yet in the labor force. As full-time students usually have
lower earnings, estimates obtained when only a portion of the participants have entered the labor
market could understate the true long-run benefits of an intervention, or even get the sign wrong,
especially if the intervention increases schooling and delays labor market entry. Moreover, as noted
in the introduction, if labor market experience and education are complements, even early estimates
obtained when all participants are in the labor force could understate the true long-run benefits
of the intervention, if individual labor productivity grows more rapidly over time for the more
educated, for instance. This raises the possibility that very long-run evaluations may be necessary
to confidently assess true programs impacts and cost-effectiveness.
In this section, we assess the evidence from the emerging body of literature that exploits RCTs
to estimate long-run impacts of development interventions. One pattern that emerges from the
handful of existing studies is that human capital interventions appear to be particularly effective
at boosting long-run economic outcomes. For instance, direct investments in child health, such
as deworming (Baird et al., 2016a), nutritional supplementation (Hoddinott et al., 2008), and
perinatal interventions (Charpak et al., 2016) have all been found to generate meaningful impacts
on adult labor productivity. Certain investments in education, including cognitive stimulation in
early childhood (Gertler et al., 2014; Kagitcibasi et al., 2009) and scholarship programs (Bettinger
et al., 2018) also yield positive returns. Interventions that aim to improve child education, nutrition
and health by leveraging a conditional cash transfer similarly appear to have persistent effects on
earnings in some cases (Barham et al., 2017), although not in others: Molina Millán et al. (2018b)
find no meaningful impacts, possibly because their sample population is still relatively young.
The other set of RCTs that estimate long-run impacts examine unconditional cash transfers
and various entrepreneurial grant assistance programs. These programs typically have quite large
short-term effects on labor and firm productivity — see, for example, Blattman et al. (2013). Yet,
most gains appear to fade out after several years (Blattman et al., 2018b,a; Araujo et al., 2017).
Similar patterns are sometimes observed in medium-run follow-up studies (Baird et al., 2016b).
One exception, which we discuss further below, is provided by multifaceted programs that provide
assets to poor households as well as training and other forms of support (Banerjee et al., 2016;
Bandiera et al., 2017, 2018), which appear to have more persistent effects.
Table 1 summarizes all the studies (to the best of our knowledge) that satisfy our screening
criteria. For inclusion a study had to
1. be in a relevant category (cash transfer or child health interventions),
2. have randomized treatment,
3. report outcomes at least (roughly) ten years after the intervention started,
4. report labor market or living standards outcomes.
While we mainly focus on long-run impacts of cash transfers and child health interventions,
for completeness we also briefly discuss other relevant studies in the main text (though some
are omitted from Table 1 due to our inclusion criteria). In this review, we interpret “long-run
impacts” to be persistent effects on the labor market or living standards outcomes of the program
beneficiaries, over a period of roughly 10 years. We focus on labor market outcomes because they
directly reflect individual productivity, and largely determine future household living standards in
7

most cases. Many studies document short to medium-run schooling gains, but these may or may
not translate into higher earnings due to institutional or other constraints, hence the importance of
directly assessing labor market outcomes. It is notable that many of the studies discussed in Table
1 are new unpublished working papers (at the time of writing this article).

2.1

Long-run Impacts of Cash Transfers

Cash transfer programs can achieve large persistent impacts if (1) the poor have high returns to
physical capital, and business grants relax constraints in their ability to borrow, save and mitigate
risk, thereby improving living standards; or (2) the poor have high returns to human capital, and
cash transfers or direct education and health interventions promote investments in education and
health, thereby improving living standards. Even if cash transfers do not lead to persistent impacts
on consumption, the rate of return and welfare impacts of the programs could potentially be large.
Suppose, for example, that people are credit constrained, and have a high rate of return to a good
purchased with the transfer that is not permanent but persists for several years, e.g., a motorcycle
that they use as a taxi, or a metal roof that allows them to avoid purchasing grass for thatching, but
that this good completely depreciates before the final endline measurement. Suppose also that they
allocate all of the income generated by the good before it depreciated into immediate consumption,
so there were no persistent welfare gains at the time of endline measurement. If the net present
value of the temporary consumption gains due to the transfer were sufficiently large relative to the
size of the transfer, the program may have nonetheless been highly beneficial. The total welfare
impacts can be recovered if measurements are collected sufficiently frequently, although that is
typically not the case. In this sub-section, we assess the accumulating evidence on the magnitude
and persistence of the effects of cash transfer programs, beginning with unconditional cash transfer
programs.

2.1.1

Unconditional Cash Transfers

Evidence on the long-term impacts of unconditional cash transfers remains scarce, as they were
fairly uncommon in the early wave of development RCTs in the 1990’s and early 2000’s. One
exception is Araujo et al. (2017), who study the long-term effects of the Ecuador Bono de Desarrollo
Humano (BDH, translation: Human Development Voucher) program. As in many development
RCTs, the control group began receiving treatment three years after the treatment group, most
likely dampening estimated program impacts and leading estimates to be lower bounds on true
effects, relative to a trial design with a never-treated control group. The authors find that 10 years
after the program, children in the early treatment group did not improve learning outcomes in late
childhood. Using a regression discontinuity design to exploit the poverty index cutoff, they also
show that cash transfers received in late childhood modestly increased the proportion of young
women who completed secondary school, but did not affect their education and work choices after
graduation. Taken together, there are limited detectable long-run impacts of a fairly generous
unconditional cash transfer program.
The fade out of effects from unconditional cash transfers have also been observed in the medium
run by Baird et al. (2016b)5 . In a cash transfer program with both unconditional and conditional
transfer arms in Malawi, they find that female unconditional cash transfer recipients show a modest
delay in the timing of marriage, fertility and HIV infection, but that these effects fade out after
roughly two years. There are some differences across the unconditional and conditional cash transfer
arms; for instance, for girls who had already dropped out of school when the study began, two years
of conditional cash transfers do produce meaningful increases in educational attainment and lead
them to marry significantly more educated husbands, which may lead to long-run benefits.
2.1.2

Entrepreneurial Grants

The long-run effects of entrepreneurial grant programs are similarly mixed, possibly due to the
very heterogeneous nature of the interventions and populations studied. Blattman et al. (2018b)
study the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP), an entrepreneurial grant program launched in
Uganda in 2008. The program granted hundreds of small groups $400 per person to “kick-start”
microenterprises. The program increased average earnings by 38% and consumption by 10% after
4 years (Blattman et al., 2013), but after 9 years, the control group had completely caught up with
the treatment group in terms of employment, earnings, and consumption. There are lasting effects
on assets and occupational choice, suggesting some persistent economic gains. YOP beneficiaries
and their children also show little to no health or education gains, except for modest improvements
in physical functioning among children of female recipients. These results are consistent with
the findings of Blattman et al. (2018a)6 , which finds that a program in Ethiopia that provided
grants of $300 plus basic business consulting raised incomes by one third in the first year, but that
employment and earnings largely converged across the treatment and control groups within 5 years.
While both unconditional cash transfer programs and entrepreneurial grant programs appear
to initially help the poor accumulate assets, evidence from the limited number of studies at hand
is broadly consistent and indicate that these assets are generally gradually run down over time,

generating little permanent impacts on poverty. One possible explanation is that neither type of
program directly ties the transfers to human capital investments. A notable exception are programs
that tie asset transfers to more intensive training and support, namely, the multifaceted assistance
projects targeted at the extremely poor studied by Bandiera et al. (2017) and Banerjee et al. (2016).
Banerjee et al. (2016) find that an asset transfer combined with support for 18 months in India
generated impacts that persisted and even grew over seven years. Positive effects are found across
all categories of outcomes, including consumption, assets, income, food security, financial stability,
time spent working, and physical and mental health. Bandiera et al. (2017) find similar evidence
for persistent effects of a program transferring livestock and training, valued at $1120 in 2007 PPP,
to the ultra poor in Bangladesh. Like Blattman et al. (2018b), they find persistent effects on
assets and occupational choice (in particular livestock rearing) seven years after the program, but
in contrast to other work, they also find persistent effects on consumption. Some of the estimates
for impacts after seven years are likely to be lower bounds since the control group was subsequently
phased into treatment.
Using the same exogenous variation induced by the BRAC TUP program (Bandiera et al.,
2017), Bandiera et al. (2018) present evidence for the existence of poverty traps in this setting,
providing a potential explanation for the persistent gains they find. Conceptually, poverty traps
can occur when there are increasing returns to scale to factors that can be accumulated, and
when credit markets are imperfect. They find that in their sample, individuals’ assets exhibit a
bi-modal distribution: after the intervention, those above a certain threshold accumulate assets at
a decreasing rate, while individuals below that threshold lose assets at an increasing rate. This is
consistent with theoretical predictions from a poverty trap model with multiple equilibria. While
the authors provide evidence for a poverty trap in their setting, few other cash transfer programs
seem to generate persistent effects. It is, of course, possible that the assistance provided in other
programs was simply too small to move recipients over the threshold needed to escape the poverty
trap. Yet both the NGO Give Directly (Haushofer & Shapiro, 2018) and the 19th century Georgia
land lottery (Bleakley & Ferrie, 2013) provided very large-scale transfers and the evidence from
neither suggests poverty traps. Moreover, empirical wealth distributions are typically unimodal,
rather than following the bimodal distribution observed in Bandiera et al. (2018)’s setting, so the
existence of poverty traps may be specific to certain contexts.
What explains the differences in impacts between these “ultra-poor” programs and other enterprise grant and assistance projects? While there is no definitive answer, there are several plausible
interpretations, beyond the possibility that this particular setting and population had conditions
that led to a poverty trap. Differences in targeting (i.e., the poor versus the extremely poor) could
play a role. Finally, the multifaceted and intensive training in the ultra-poor programs may have
induced greater human capital accumulation or addressed behavioral barriers to saving. Further
research is needed to provide more definitive answers.
2.1.3

Conditional Cash Transfers

Despite the proliferation of evaluations of conditional cash transfer programs, especially in Latin
America, high-quality experimental evidence on their long-term impacts remains limited. The
estimation of long-run impacts is also complicated by the fact that many RCTs employ phase-in
designs, in which the control group later receives treatment, sometimes after only a year or so. As
we discuss below (Section 4), phase-in designs are likely to yield lower bounds on the treatment
effects that would be obtained with a pure control group (that never received treatment), somewhat
14

changing the interpretation of effect estimates and also making null results harder to interpret.
Barham et al. (2017) and Barham et al. (2018) evaluate a three-year conditional cash transfer
program in Nicaragua, which was later phased in. They exploit the fact that although both the
“early treatment” and “late treatment” groups received three years’ worth of cash transfers, in
the latter group the boys largely missed the transfers that were most likely to prevent them from
dropping out of school, and the girls missed the transfers during their potentially critical early
teenage years, around the onset of puberty. After 10 years, among children aged 9–12 years at
the start of the program, young men in the early treatment group show increased schooling and
learning, which translated into more engagement in wage work, higher rates of temporary migration
for better paying jobs, and higher earnings; young women in the early treatment group reached
sexual maturity later, had lower BMI scores, and started sexual activities later, resulting in lower
overall fertility in young adulthood. Despite modest effects on education and learning outcomes
for young women, they experienced similar earnings and labor market participation gains as men.
Buchmann et al. (2018) evaluate a program aimed at reducing child marriage and teenage
childbearing and increasing girls’ education in Bangladesh. The authors cross-randomized a sixmonth empowerment program, and a financial incentive to delay marriage. Nine years after the
program started (and four and a half years after the end of the program), girls randomized to
receive conditional cash incentives get married later and are less likely to bear a child as teenagers.
Unlike cash transfer programs that are conditional on school enrolment or attendance, this program
also benefits vulnerable girls that are already out of school at baseline. The authors find that
empowerment programs alone have no discernible effect on marriage, but do improve education.
The empowerment program also increases income-generating activities, in particular labor market
participation, among older girls.
Evidence from other related interventions is less conclusive. PROGRESA/Oportunidades is the
pioneering Mexican conditional cash transfer program that has served as a model for many other
programs in Latin America and beyond, and was evaluated with an RCT in its pilot phase. The
program started in 1997 and offered monetary transfers to households conditional on investing in
education, health, and nutrition of the children (e.g., attendance at school, regular clinic visits).
Many studies have exploited the experimental design to assess medium- and long-run impacts (see
Parker & Todd (2017) for a survey) but the long-run studies are limited by the original evaluation
sample’s research design: policymakers decided that the original control group villages would be
phased into treatment a mere 18 months after the treatment communities, creating a relatively short
gap between the early and late treatment groups. Moreover, participant attrition in follow-up survey
rounds was relatively high and differential across treatment arms. Exploiting this data, Behrman
et al. (2011)7 show that in the medium-run by 2003 (six years after the start of the program), the
greater exposure (of 18 months) to the program in early treatment PROGRESA/Oportunidades
communities significantly increases schooling for both genders and decreases participation in the
labor force for boys, but not for girls.
Given the limitation of the research design and follow-up survey data, long-run impacts of
PROGRESA/Oportunidades on labor force participation, wages and earnings are mostly estimated
non-experimentally,8 and are mostly large and positive. Adhvaryu et al. (2018) focus on a small
cohort who were 18 at the time of the 2003 survey, and show that PROGRESA has significant

impacts on the probability of stable employment immediately following high school completion
among disadvantaged children (proxied by rainfall shocks in early childhood), but no impact on
children with greater endowments. Parker & Vogl (2018) use a difference-in-differences strategy
and leverage both the spatio-temporal variation in program roll-out at the municipal level and
cohort variation in the age at which children were treated. They find that childhood exposure
to PROGRESA improves educational attainment, geographic mobility, labor market outcomes,
and household economic outcomes in early adulthood: the program increased mean labor force
participation by 30–40% and labor income by 50% for women. Kugler & Rojas (2018) exploit
similar sources of variation, combined with propensity score weighting, and estimate significant
positive impacts of the program on both the likelihood and quality of employment.
In contrast, Molina Millán et al. (2018b)’s evaluation of the Honduras PRAF II conditional
cash transfer program estimates more ambiguous effects on beneficiaries’ labor market outcomes.
They use national census microdata and assign individuals their treatment status based on their
municipality of birth, the unit of randomization in the RCT. Transfer recipients have significantly
higher schooling attainment 13 years after the start of the program, with a notable increase in the
likelihood of attaining university studies. Program receipt also more than doubles the probability
of international migration among young men. However, impacts on labor market outcomes are
less clear-cut: they find no significant treatment effects on wages or earnings, except for some
negative effects on women’s hours worked. The labor market results are difficult to interpret as
some young adults are still transitioning into the labor market (for instance, the students enrolled
in university), and thus further follow-up surveys could be useful to more reliably assess impacts
on lifetime earnings.
There is some evidence that the mode of delivery for cash transfers may be important in
determining schooling and other outcomes. For instance, Barrera-Osorio et al. (2017)9 leverage
administrative data to analyze the Colombian Conditional Subsidies for School Attendance (Subsidios Condicionados a la Asistencia Escolar) program in 2005. The experiment has three treatment
arms: the “basic” bimonthly transfers; the “savings” treatment where families were forced to save
a portion of the transfers until they make school enrollment decisions; and a “tertiary” transfer
that is conditional on tertiary school enrollment. While the various cash transfer arms are all effective in boosting short-run secondary school enrollment, only the “savings” treatment improves
longer-term educational outcomes, particularly tertiary enrollment.10
2.1.4

Scholarship Programs

Scholarship or school voucher programs are closely related to some conditional cash transfer interventions, in that the award is conditional on school attendance (although not identical, since
scholarship funding can only be spent directly on education). There are now several long-run RCT
evaluations of scholarship programs. As we survey here, these tend to show both meaningful gains
in educational attainment and subsequent benefits in the labor market.
Bettinger et al. (2018) evaluate the PACES voucher program in Colombia. The program used
a lottery to assign vouchers for private secondary schools among applicants from public elementary
schools in the poorest two socioeconomic strata in Colombia. The authors sampled the lottery win9

ners and losers in 1994 and matched their IDs to five different administrative datasets, including a
rich set of educational, financial and labor market outcomes. Up to 20 years later, when applicants’
average age was roughly 33, the voucher winners had completed significantly more tertiary education, had experienced lower teen fertility, had annual formal earnings that were 8% higher than
lottery losers, and had greater access to formal consumer credit and better credit scores. Notably,
these impacts on formal sector earnings are entirely driven by applicants to vocational (as opposed
to academic) schools. Effects on formal earnings and payroll taxes are also concentrated among the
top 40% of the sample distribution: much of the voucher effect appears to work through increasing
the odds that winners make it into the “middle class”. A fiscal calculation based on impacts on
formal sector earnings and payroll taxes shows that the program is likely to generate large and
positive public finance benefits.
Duflo et al. (2018) evaluate a 2008 secondary school scholarship program in Ghana, and also
find positive effects on some labor market outcomes. The program randomized full scholarships for
public high schools among rural youth who had gained admission but did not immediately enroll.
Five years after receipt of the scholarship, winners show increased educational attainment and
improved cognitive skills, and also engage in more preventative health behaviors; sample females
are less likely to have become pregnant. Nine years after the program, treated individuals were
significantly more likely to have public sector jobs, jobs which tend to be characterized by a high
wage premium, more benefits, and greater job security. They are also more likely to have jobs with
benefits, or jobs they characterize as permanent. Yet there were no significant differences between
scholarship winners and losers in total earnings, log earnings conditional on positive earnings, or
hours worked for those observed to be working. These null effects on earnings should be interpreted
with caution, however, as the confidence intervals are fairly wide and cannot exclude either zero
effects or very large private returns. Moreover, a non-trivial portion of participants are still receiving
tertiary education, and that portion is significantly higher in the treatment group, raising the
possibility that treatment effects may grow over time. This pattern is particularly important if we
believe that, as Bettinger et al. (2018) showed, gains from these programs tend to be concentrated
at the top of the distribution. The authors caution that while these results indicate positive private
returns to education to the extent that education simply helps people get access to jobs with
rents, it may not generate similar social returns. It is also worth noting that the impact of the
scholarships on obtaining public sector jobs only became apparent over time, likely because many
of the positions require tertiary education.
Taken together, the findings from the existing long-run randomized evaluations of both conditional cash transfer programs and scholarship programs indicate that very long follow-up periods
— often of greater than a decade — may be necessary to confidently estimate program impacts on
lifetime earnings. This is due to the fact that many beneficiaries are still in school in their 20’s, and
that certain positions (such as public sector or formal private sector jobs) have rising wage profiles
that only become apparent over time. These issues may be particularly important for females in
low income countries, many of whom also have lower labor market participation in early adulthood
than they will exhibit later on in life.
A lack of statistical power is also often a challenge in long-term impact evaluation. Income is
typically measured with considerable noise, especially in low- and middle- income settings. Measurement concerns are exacerbated by the fact that actual income is highly skewed, that most people
obtain a large proportion of their income from self-employment or informal activities in low income
countries, often with strong seasonal variability, and that these income sources may be subject to

17

important reporting biases. For these reasons, in some settings, other socio-economic indicators,
such as jobs with benefits, “permanent” jobs and public sector jobs as in Duflo et al. (2018), may
sometimes be more informative about long-run living standards than snapshot income measures.
Increasing the frequency of measurements may also be helpful in averaging out measurement errors
when dealing with such noisy outcomes (McKenzie, 2012).
Finally, we highlight concerns regarding the “file drawer problem” and publication bias in
assessing the studies surveyed here. It is possible that studies that delivered null results or less
interesting findings are less likely to be published, or even to be written up in the first place. Even
within published studies, there may be concerns that outcomes with statistically significant results
are emphasized over potentially more meaningful outcomes where impacts are less pronounced.
This is a particularly important issue given the latitude that researchers often have in selecting
results to report across a range of outcomes or sample sub-groups. In subsequent sections, we
discuss the importance of collecting comprehensive follow-up measurement across a wide range of
experiments, ideally with prespecified outcomes and statistical tests, which could be expected to
deliver a more complete picture about the overall impacts of a particular intervention and of the
body of evidence as a whole.

2.2

Long-run Impacts of Child Health Interventions

The literature on the short-term impacts of child health interventions is vast, spanning public
health, economics, education, psychology and nutrition. The RCT evidence on long-run economic
impacts of health is far more limited. The limited existing evidence finds generally positive impacts
of child health interventions on adult productivity.
2.2.1

Deworming

As discussed in Section 1, the more traditional approach to studying long-term impacts is leveraging historical natural experiments for (hopefully) quasi-random variation in treatment. In the
deworming case, Bleakley (2007) studied the successful eradication of hookworm disease from the
American South and found large positive long-run educational and socio-economic impacts. These
results are echoed by experimental evidence in developing countries. The Kenya deworming study
(Miguel & Kremer, 2004) evaluates an experiment starting in 1998 that randomized 75 schools into
an intervention group of free deworming drug treatment and worm prevention health education,
and control groups. The control group schools were phased into deworming treatment 2 to 3 years
after the early treatment groups, a larger gap between early treatment and late treatment groups
than was observed in the experimental PROGRESA/Oportunidades evaluation, for instance. In
the short-run, Miguel & Kremer (2004) estimate increased school participation rates, and reductions in worm infections among those who directly received drugs as well as evidence for treatment
externalities, but no significant improvements in students academic or cognitive test scores.
There have since been multiple follow-up survey rounds of the a representative subsample of the
deworming sample, in what is called the Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), starting in 2003. These
panel (longitudinal) surveys have been characterized by relatively high respondent effective tracking rates11 , of approximately 83.9 percent (among those still alive), with tracking rates balanced
across the treatment and control groups. In the second follow-up round (KLPS-2) collected during
11
The effective tracking rate (ETR) is a function of the regular phase tracking rate (RTR) and intensive phase
tracking rate (ITR) as follows: ET R = RT R + (1 − RT R) × IT R.

18

2007–2009 roughly 10 years after the start of the deworming project, Baird et al. (2016a) find
that deworming program beneficiaries showed increased educational attainment, especially among
women (women were 25% more likely to have attended secondary school) while labor supply increased among men (men worked 17% more hours each week), with accompanying shifts in labor
market specialization. Since the deworming treatment is inexpensive (at less than US$1 per person
per year), the authors estimate a large annualized financial internal rate of return of 51.0% when
accounting for health spillovers.
There is new evidence of similarly large impacts on economic productivity and living standards
in the third KLPS follow-up survey round (KLPS-3), which was collected during 2011–2013, approximately 15 years after the start of the Primary School Deworming Project. Baird et al. (2018)
show that respondent tracking rates were similarly high, at 84 percent and once again balanced
across treatment and control groups. Treatment group respondents still have higher total earnings, with an average gain of 13%, which once again implies an extremely high rate of return to
school-based deworming program spending. This KLPS round also features a detailed consumption
expenditure module, which allows for more reliable assessment of household living standards. The
data indicate that consumption is also significantly higher in the treatment group, with an average
effect of 23%. The gains in both total earnings and consumption are considerably larger among
males, echoing results from KLPS-2. Beyond economic productivity and living standards, treatment group beneficiaries are significantly more likely to live in a city than the control group, have
improvements in certain home characteristics (including improving flooring and greater likelihood
of being connected to the electricity grid), and also show gains in subjective wellbeing, specifically
a question that asks about happiness. Taken together, the Kenya deworming project provides evidence of meaningful long-run gains in economic productivity and living standards along multiple
dimensions at both 10 and 15 years following the start of the intervention.
While the evidence on the benefits of deworming in the labor market comes primarily from
the Miguel & Kremer (2004) sample, there is evidence on deworming’s educational and cognitive
impacts in a related sample. Ozier (2018)12 estimates large cognitive gains 10 years after the
start of treatment among children who were 0 to 2 years old when the Kenya deworming program
was launched and who lived in the catchment area of a treatment school. These children were
not directly treated themselves but were in position to benefit from positive within-community
externalities generated by mass school-based deworming. Ozier (2018) estimates average test score
gains of 0.3 standard deviation units, which is equivalent to roughly half a year of schooling. It is
worth noting that the Baird et al. (2016a) sample (who were already enrolled in primary school) do
not experience improvements in test scores, which is consistent with the hypothesis that nutritional
interventions are particularly effective in improving child cognition in critical early periods. These
patterns among two distinct samples across multiple time points taken together indicate that the
treatment effects found in Ozier (2018), Miguel & Kremer (2004), Baird et al. (2016a) and Baird
et al. (2018) are unlikely to be driven by chance.
As we discuss below, many other studies show that early childhood interventions in utero or
before age three can have large positive impacts (Gertler et al., 2014; Hoddinott et al., 2008).
Evidence from the Kenya deworming project suggest that health interventions among somewhat
older school-aged children can also have sizable long-run impacts on labor market outcomes through
a combination of impacts on education, nutrition and health status.

2.2.2

Nutritional Supplementation

The earliest experimental evidence on long-run returns to child health interventions comes from
the well-known INCAP experiment in rural Guatemala. Between 1969 and 1977, two nutritional
supplements — a high-protein energy drink versus a low-energy drink devoid of protein — were
made available twice daily in the village and randomly assigned to pre-school children in four
villages (Hoddinott et al., 2008; Maluccio et al., 2009; Behrman et al., 2009). Researchers find
evidence of a 46% gain in adult wages for males who were exposed to the nutritional supplement
before 3 years of age (Hoddinott et al., 2008). They also find improved cognitive skills among
both men and women (Maluccio et al., 2009), and even some positive inter-generational effects on
the nutrition of the female beneficiaries’ children up to 35 years later . This is a highly unusual
and exceptional data collection effort, and it provides evidence that childhood health and nutrition
gains can have large returns in terms of adult labor productivity.
Through the lens of more recent studies, the pioneering INCAP study also has some limitations.
First, it has a small effective sample size of just four villages (since the intervention did not vary
within villages), and it is unclear if all the existing studies fully account for the intra-cluster
correlation of respondent outcomes in their analyses, thus perhaps leading them to overstate the
statistical significance of estimated effects. Second, within each village, receipt of the nutritious
drink was voluntary, so those who were treated were not a random sample of the population within
each village. In this case, the most convincing estimation strategy may be an intention to treat
analysis, yet some studies report the direct effects of receiving nutritious drinks on outcomes,
potentially introducing selection bias. Finally, sample attrition is a concern in both the 1988–
89 follow-up and the most recent surveys, as more than one quarter of the original sample were
apparently lost by 1988–89 and roughly 40% by the time of the 35 year follow-up survey.
A public health study, Prado et al. (2017)13 follows up on the sample from a more recent experiment, the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT), which
provides maternal supplementation with multiple micronutrients (MMN) or iron and folic acid (IFA)
in Indonesia. The MMN intervention provided the same nutrients as IFA, plus various vitamins,
zinc, copper, selenium and iodine, which are thought to have benefits for development in utero.
The project has a massive sample size of 31,290 women enrolled in the trial during 2001–2004. The
authors find that the children (who were 9–12 years old at the time of the follow-up survey) had
better cognition and academic achievement if their mothers had been assigned to MMN instead
of IFA. This opens up the possibility of longer-term labor market gains, although these are yet to
be established in this sample. Unfortunately, as with the INCAP study, sample attrition in the
SUMMIT sample is substantial: only 62% of participants were re-enrolled in the follow-up, among
which a representative subset of children were selected for cognitive testing.
2.2.3

Cognitive Stimulation

The well-known Jamaica experiment (Gertler et al., 2014) carried out during 1986–1987 provides
some of the earliest and most compelling evidence on the long-run benefits of early childhood psychosocial stimulation in a low-income country. The intervention targeted growth-stunted toddlers
and consisted of weekly visits over a 2-year period by community health workers who taught parenting skills and ways to interact with children to develop cognitive and socio-emotional skills. The

20

authors found that 20 years later, the intervention increased participants’ full-time job earnings by
a massive 25%. For non-temporary jobs, the gains are even higher, at 48%.
These labor market gains could result from increased parental investments in children, increased
schooling, and from migration. At the end of the 2-year intervention, the researchers find that the
treatment increased the quality of parental interaction and investment in children, as measured
by the HOME inventory (Caldwell et al., 1984). These effects faded out in mid-to-late childhood
(at age 7 and 11) but then did ultimately translate to more years of schooling attainment, again
illustrating that the absence of effects at one time point does not preclude finding effects later.
The authors also find suggestive evidence that the treated group tends to migrate more, and that
migrants earned substantially more than those who stayed in Jamaica.
The Jamaica study achieved a fairly low attrition rate of 18.6%, which is much lower than
several other early experiments described in this section, including the 40% attrition in the INCAP
experiment and 49% in the Turkish Early Enrichment Project (TEEP) discussed below. One
important limitation, however, is its modest sample size of 129. Another caveat is that the authors
were only able to track 14 out of 23 migrants in the sample, and treatment group individuals
were over-represented among the 14 migrants tracked. This differential attrition of migrants across
treatment arms could potentially bias treatment effect estimates upward.
Despite the large positive gains to small-scale psychosocial stimulation programs, some efforts
to scale up these interventions have been less successful. Andrew et al. (2018) studied a scalable
psychosocial stimulation intervention, implemented at larger scale and using the institutional infrastructure of existing government services. Two years after the program ended, they found no
effects on child test scores, cognition, behavior, stimulation in the home environment or maternal
depressive symptoms. The authors note that it is possible that intervention effects may appear
later on, and long-term effects are unknown.
Another early RCT in the psychology literature, the Turkish Early Enrichment Project (Kagitcibasi et al., 2009) provides further evidence on an early childhood stimulation intervention carried
out during 1983–1985 among children aged 4–6 from deprived backgrounds. The intervention randomized children into one of three alternative care environments: an educational day care center,
a custodial day care center, or the home. Half of the mothers in each care environment were randomly assigned to receive parenting training related to cognitive stimulation. The 22-year follow-up
analysis grouped all treatment arms together into “any stimulation” and found that treated participants had more favorable outcomes in terms of educational attainment, occupational status,
and integration into modern urban life, such as owning a computer. The effects of the enrichment
treatment on consumption were positive but not statistically significant. Two limitations are the
high sample attrition rate of 49% mentioned above, as well as the fact that assignment to the
different preschool environments was not entirely random, but determined in part by availability
at the workplace, possibly leading to some selection bias.
2.2.4

Perinatal Interventions

There are many RCTs involving perinatal interventions in public health, but they have received
relatively little attention from economics researchers to date. While it is unusual for public health
studies to collect long-run employment and labor market outcomes, Charpak et al. (2016) do so.
They study the 20-year impacts of a kangaroo mother care (KMC) intervention14 in Colombia and
14

continuous skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant; (2) exclusive breastfeeding when possible; and (3) timely

21

find that the intervention increased beneficiaries’ school attendance, and later wages and labor
force participation. However, sample attrition was again substantial, unfortunately: the authors
were only able to survey 441 participants (62% of all the original participants), including 264
participants weighing less than 1800g at birth, who were thought to be most likely to gain from
the intervention. Another potential methodological concern is the fact that statistical significance
levels were not adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing.
The Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) in Belarus randomized 31 maternity hospitals and affiliated polyclinics to either the control arm or the intervention, which aimed at
increasing breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, during 1996–1997. In a follow-up survey carried
out 16 years later, Martin et al. (2017)15 successfully followed up 79.5% of the 17,046 breastfeeding
mother-infant pairs who participated in the original trial. They do not find any effects of the intervention on the obesity or blood pressure levels of the infant beneficiaries (who were young adults
at the follow-up survey). However, it remains an open question whether this intervention impacts
other health outcomes, or any cognitive and economic outcomes in the long run.
Bhalotra et al. (2017) evaluate an intervention that provided psychotherapy to perinatally depressed mothers in rural Pakistan. The intervention successfully reduced depression at the time.
Seven years later, it also increased women’s financial empowerment, control over household spending, as well as time- and monetary-intensive parental investments, especially on girls. These investments have the potential to translate into later gains in cognition, education and labor market
outcomes, although longer-term effects are unknown.

2.3

Differential Impacts by Gender

Substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects along gender lines is common across several of the
interventions that we survey in this article. However, the literature does not seem to converge
on whether it is men or women who consistently gain more from the interventions, or on the
mechanisms driving the differences. Here we highlight the findings from the long-run studies that
we review in Table 1, and call for further research to help reconcile these findings with each other,
as well as with predictions from economic theory.
Baird et al. (2016a) and Baird et al. (2018) observe that school deworming treatment effects in
both total earnings and consumption are larger in magnitude among males 10 to 15 years after the
intervention, although differences are not always statistically significant. In contrast, women who
were eligible for deworming as girls are 25% more likely to have attended secondary school, halving
the gender gap, and they reallocate time away from traditional agriculture and into cash crops and
entrepreneurship. Men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years of primary school,
work 17% more hours each week, spend more time in entrepreneurship, are more likely to hold
manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week (Baird et al., 2016a). The authors argue that
these results are broadly consistent with the theory of human capital presented in Pitt et al. (2012),
in which time allocation depends on how the labor market values both improved human capital and
improved raw labor capacity, and this may vary by gender in low-income “brawn-based” economies.
In particular, Pitt et al. (2012) present evidence consistent with a model in which exogenous health
gains tend to reinforce men’s comparative advantage in occupations requiring raw labor, while
leading women to obtain more education and move into more skill-intensive occupations.
(early) discharge with close follow-up (Charpak et al., 2016).
15
We omit this study from Table 1 because it does not report long-run labor market outcomes.

22

Unlike for primary school deworming, Barham et al. (2017) and Barham et al. (2018) find
that a conditional cash transfer program in Nicaragua generated similar effects on earnings and
labor market participation for both men and women, and they uncover quite different underlying
causal mechanisms that in many ways are the reverse of those identified in the KLPS. Unlike with
deworming, both education and learning gains here are concentrated among males, in a context
where boys typically drop out of school at younger ages than girls. Women experienced at most
modest effects on education and learning, but improved nutrition and reproductive health during
teenage years, which the authors argue could translate into labor market gains.
Duflo et al. (2018) study the impacts of secondary school scholarships in rural Ghana and find
larger effects on learning and progress to tertiary education among females. In particular they note
that the “marginal” males (who were only sent to secondary school because of the scholarship)
were much less likely to go on to tertiary education than inframarginal males, while marginal
females were just as likely to go on to tertiary education as inframarginal females. They argue
that families may typically already send academically promising boys to senior secondary schools
even in the absence of scholarships, but that there may be heterogeneity among households in their
treatment of girls, with some but not all households sending promising girls to school in the absence
of scholarships. The “marginal” girls could therefore have higher underlying ability than similarly
marginal boys.
Bettinger et al. (2018) examine the effects of private secondary school scholarships in Colombia,
and observe large positive effects on the probability of ever enrolling in tertiary education (including vocational schools and universities), formal credit access, and formal sector earnings, with the
strongest scholarship impacts among vocational school applicants, as noted above. Within the vocational sub-population, there are larger effects among males; within the academic sub-population,
females seem to benefit more, although differences across gender tend not to be statistically significant.
Several other studies find more positive long-run effects for males. Hoddinott et al. (2008)
find that in the INCAP experiment (the nutritional intervention in Guatemala), all effects are
concentrated among men and effects for women are typically smaller and not statistically significant.
Molina Millán et al. (2018b) find that the conditional cash transfer in Honduras leads to increased
international migration for young men, by 3 to 7 percentage points, with the effects being smaller
for women. There is also evidence that, among those who received the conditional cash transfers,
women, but not men, reduced their labor supply. The authors caution that this does not necessarily
imply negative labor market impacts for women, as the beneficiaries are still transitioning from
school into the labor market. Finally, Blattman et al. (2018b) find that the treatment effects of
an entrepreneurial grant in Uganda have largely faded out after 9 years. However, among the few
impacts that persisted, effects on durable asset ownership are higher among men, whereas effects
on occupational choice (such as engagement in a skilled trade) are higher among women.
Further theoretical and conceptual work will likely be needed to make sense of these findings
by gender, and additional empirical research will be important to understand which patterns are
robust across settings. It will be particularly useful to follow effects over a longer time period, and
to relate any differences to patterns of marriage, fertility, and female labor force participation across
study environments, as well as to patterns of occupational segregation and gender wage gaps.

WHAT CAN WE LEARN? OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS

The large number of experimental cash transfer and child health studies conducted during the late
1990’s and the 2000’s provide an opportunity to conduct long-term follow-up studies, as described
in Section 1. But how feasible is this opportunity in practice? In this section, we systematically
survey and evaluate the opportunities and limitations of the existing pool of cash transfer and child
health RCT studies.16

3.1

Cash Transfers

We focus here on unconditional or conditional cash transfer experimental studies that examine
impacts on either the living standards or economic productivity of individuals and households.
3.1.1

Study Screening Criteria

Appendix A provides a detailed description of the screening procedure and justifications for our
selection criteria. Study selection was based on six main criteria, namely, for inclusion a study had
to:
1. have randomized treatment,
2. have been implemented before 2010 (to allow for long-run follow-up),
3. have sufficient statistical power (and relatedly, a sufficiently large sample size),
4. be properly implemented (in ways we make precise in Appendix A),
5. have sufficient differential exposure to the intervention across treatment arms,
6. and have the potential for a reasonably high respondent tracking rate.
Among the 170 publications extracted from the seven meta-analysis studies identified during
our review, 18 cash transfer studies appear eligible for long-term follow-up research (see Table 2).
If we additionally exclude the six studies that have already benefited from a long-term follow-up of
labor market outcomes, 12 studies appear to be particularly promising for new long-term studies.
We think of these 12 studies as “low-hanging fruit” for the research community. Yet, the fact that
the majority of existing cash transfer RCTs end up being excluded due to important design or data
limitations also indicates that many past experiments have, unfortunately, not been set up to allow
for longer-term evaluation. In Section 4 below, we discuss several approaches that could improve
this yield rate for future experiments.
16

The overall screening strategy was carried out as part of the Long-term Impact Discovery (LID) project financed
by GiveWell and co-chaired by Prashant Bharawadj (UCSD) and Craig McIntosh (UCSD). We thank both of them
for their leadership in the project and their crucial intellectual contribution to this section of the paper. The LID
project does not focus on education interventions, but in our view there are also likely to be abundant opportunities
for conducting long-term impact evaluations in education given the large number of education RCTs. Assessing the
existing pool of education RCTs is beyond the scope of this article.

24

3.1.2

Eligible Studies

Table 2 describes the 18 RCTs that meet all the selection criteria and are considered attractive for
conducting a long-term follow-up study. Among these experiments, four (denoted by the acronyms
AAC, NCTPP, SCAE and ZOMBA, see Table 2 for references and details) present particularly
favorable features: all had interventions that were well implemented; none featured a phase-in
design; and no long-term follow-up survey has yet been conducted. Two of these RCTs feature both
an unconditional cash transfer study arm and a conditional cash transfer arm (namely, NCTPP,
and ZOMBA), presenting a particularly fruitful setting for comparing the long-run impacts of CCTs
and UCTs.
The table also provides two important pieces of information about the selected studies that
may guide future decisions regarding whether or not to conduct a long-term follow-up. First,
in the column “Phase-in Design” we document whether the original control group subsequently
received treatment. Although phase-in studies with sufficient time lag between early treatment
and late treatment groups should not be excluded a priori, following up on phase-in studies with
a relatively short lag presents some challenges for both estimation and interpretation. We discuss
this issue in Section 4.1.
Second, we also report on the short-term impacts of each intervention on the living standards,
education, health and labor market outcomes of household adults (see Table 2, column “ShortTerm Impacts”). Conducting follow-up surveys just for studies with large and positive short-term
impacts may be tempting, and may even be justified at times, yet focusing solely on these studies
can have several undesirable consequences. First, cherry-picking only the most “favorable” studies
for follow-up surveys will generate a set of estimated long-term impacts that may be representative
of studies that yielded short-run impacts, but would be unrepresentative of the set of studies as
a whole. For scientific progress, it would be more useful to conduct follow-up studies for multiple
RCTs in this table, perhaps in a coordinated fashion (with common survey instruments, etc.) in
order to create a more complete picture of long-run impacts.

Short-Term Impacts

Table 2: Selected Cash Transfer Studies for Potential Long-term Follow-up

If one were confident that studies which yielded no short-run impact also had no long-run
impact or that, for example, effects fade out monotonically over time, one might be able to recover
estimates or bounds on long-run impacts more broadly. However, as noted above, there is evidence
that the effects of certain development interventions can “re-surface” in the long-run even after an
apparent fade-out of short-run impacts.17 The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still
not well understood. One possibility is that the short- and medium-run surveys fail to adequately
capture competencies, such as individual socio-emotional skills or job referral networks, that may
eventually generate positive impacts. Consequently, failing to follow up samples in which short- to
medium-run impacts are modest (or non-existent) may lead us to erroneously conclude interventions
were unsuccessful when in fact they do improve long-run living standards. A bottom line lesson
is that a wide and representative range of studies should be evaluated for long-run impacts, and
studies should not be ruled out for long-term follow-up because they do not find economically
meaningful or statistically significant short-term impacts.

3.2

Child Health Interventions

The child health literature is even more expansive than the body of cash transfer studies, and its
boundaries less clearly defined. We consider studies that aim to improve the overall health of a child
from in utero through adolescence.18 Our criteria include physical health interventions, as well as
psychological stimulation and preschool age child development interventions. The selection criteria
does not include education studies beyond preschool unless the intervention specifically included a
health component.19
3.2.1

Study Screening Criteria

We implement a strategy similar to that employed in the cash transfer literature to identify existing
child health RCTs that could potentially benefit from a long-term follow-up study. We identified
a total of 378 publications and, based on the same criteria used for cash transfers, restrict the
selection to 77 eligible studies; details are provided in Appendix B. As indicated in Appendix B,
these studies are grouped into five main categories (namely, nutrition, perinatal, sanitation, specific
diseases, and stimulation). Studies in the nutrition literature, listed in Table 3, represent the largest
group (32 studies), while the other categories, as shown in Table B.1, include 45 studies. In the
rest of this section, we focus, for reasons of space, on studies in the nutrition literature, and leave
a detailed discussion of other categories for Appendix B.
17
For instance, Gertler et al. (2014) report a lack of medium-run impacts, and Banerjee et al. (2016) report effects
that grow over time. Deming (2009) and Chetty et al. (2011a) show that the Head Start program and the Tennessee
STAR experiment in the U.S. improved participant outcomes in adulthood, despite initial “fade-out” of test score
gains.
18
We focus on interventions that address a public health issue and affect a meaningful proportion of children. For
instance, stunting is estimated to impact 24.3% of the children under 5 for less developed regions (Unicef et al., 2018)
and the prevalence of malaria is estimated at 9.13% for low Socio-Demographic Index regions in 2017 (Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2018). Interventions that aim to address specific syndromes or diseases (such as
genetic defects which affect very small proportions of newborns) were thus excluded from our review. More details
on the inclusion criteria are provided in Appendix B.
19
As noted above, there is a large pool of education RCTs in development economics but assessing their suitability
for long-run follow-up impact evaluation is beyond the scope of this article.

27

3.2.2

Eligible Nutrition Studies

Studies of two interventions clearly stand out in Table 3: vitamin A and mixed supplementation
studies. Mixed supplementation includes both Multiple Micronutrient (MMN) supplementation
and Lipid based Nutrient Supplements (LNS), as we discuss in more detail below.
Since the mid-1980’s, vitamin A interventions have attracted considerable attention among
nutritionists. A seminal study by Sommer et al. (1986a) among 480 villages in Indonesia suggested
that vitamin A supplementation could be a highly effective strategy for reducing mortality (−34%).
Since the mid 1980’s, multiple RCTs (Sommer, 2008) confirmed the positive effects of vitamin A,
with an effect size varying between −50% to −34% (though 2 out of 16 studies found no significant
impact on health, see Table 3). While a more recent and large-scale study has led to some questions
regarding these magnitudes (Awasthi et al., 2013a), there remains a broad consensus that vitamin
A delivered to vitamin A deficient children or pregnant woman is likely to be an effective strategy
for reducing mortality.
Yet, how these early health benefits translate into subsequent motor, cognitive ability, or longrun economic productivity impacts in long-run remains almost entirely unknown, as no such longrun studies based on experimental data exist (to our knowledge). This appears to be a promising
area for future research. Table 3 provides some additional information on the vitamin A studies
that could feasibly be followed up today. The data presented in the table appears to confirm that
vitamin A’s short-term impact on health outcomes, and particularly child mortality, is positive
overall.
It is possible that an intervention that affects mortality could pose methodological problems
for researchers examining long-run outcomes, due to the possibility of selection (or “survivorship”)
bias. Yet we do not believe this would be a major concern in practice. In the Indonesia data
in Sommer et al. (1986a), for instance, mortality amounts to only 1% of the total attrition and
0.2% of the differential attrition in a 13-month follow-up. Thus we do not believe that concerns
about differential mortality across treatment arms should deter researchers from following up on
populations that took part in vitamin A RCTs.
Another potential methodological challenge posed by the nutritional supplementation RCTs is
imperfect compliance in the control group: due to ethical concerns, in certain trials project health
staff examined control group participants and opted to provide treatment to control group children
with severe nutritional problems. This practice makes estimated treatment effects challenging to
interpret, and seems likely to dampen estimated effects. We flag studies that follow this approach
in Table 3 and Appendix Table B.1 (see notes).
Mixed supplementation interventions (namely, MMN and LNS) constitute the second largest
group of nutrition studies that we identified, as listed in Table 3. Widespread research interest
in MMN appears to be more recent than for vitamin A, with most studies dating back only to
the mid-1990’s. Many of these studies found short-run evidence that MMN supplementation,
distributed early on, positively impacts child motor and cognitive development (Eilander et al.,
2009). Prado et al. (2017) even report positive medium-term impacts on cognition at age 9–12, but
to our knowledge, the impact of MNM on long-run living standards and labor market outcomes has
never been estimated with experimental data, creating another promising opportunity for research.
The Lipid-based Nutrient literature is even more recent (starting in the early 2000’s). Most studies
estimate large positive short-run impacts of such interventions, with gains even larger than those
found for MMN interventions (Matias et al., 2017).

HOW CAN WE DO BETTER? RESEARCH DESIGN AND
DATA

This section contains a discussion of the following two questions: (1) how can researchers most
effectively assess the long-run impacts of an intervention that has already been conducted, and (2)
how can researchers design experiments and data collection to improve the feasibility of studying
long-run impacts? We discuss these two intertwined issues in the context of both research design,
as well as data collection and usage.

4.1

Research Design

The most important building block of a randomized controlled trial is the experimental design.
One type of design that is common in field experiments in economics, especially among those that
we review in this article, is the phase-in design.20 A phase-in design is where treatment groups first
receive the interventions, and then “control” groups receive the same interventions later.
A phase-in design ensures greater similarity across the treatment and comparison group in
the (eventual) distribution of assistance, arguably relaxing some ethical concerns, and may also
increase the local political acceptability of a project. It is also a natural design choice when
real-world programs are being piloted or gradually rolled out: randomizing the order of program
expansion generates treatment and control groups. These experiments include many of the earliest and most influential studies in development economics, including some of those that have
already carried out long-run follow-ups. Examples of phase-in designs include the prominent PROGRESA/Oportunidades experiment (Parker & Todd, 2017), the deworming program in Kenya
(Miguel & Kremer, 2004) and the “graduation” programs (Bandiera et al., 2017).
One might be tempted to exclude phase-in experiments when trying to learn about long-term
impacts, due to concerns that long-term effects are not identifiable when there are no pure control
groups left. However, we demonstrate that under certain assumptions detailed below, it is possible
to identify long-term treatment effects in the presence of a phase-in design, as long as measurements
are taken sufficiently frequently. We also show that the variance of treatment effect estimates will
grow linearly over time, at a rate that varies inversely to the difference in the duration of treatment
between the treatment and control groups (as denoted by T below).
Consider a setup similar to that of Borusyak & Jaravel (2016), in which a panel of units (individuals or clusters) i = 1, · · · , 2N are randomized into two (equally sized) groups j = 0, 1, which
are the control group (or “late treatment” group) and the treatment group (or “early treatment”
group), respectively. Suppose that the treatment group receives the treatment at period T0 = 0 and
the intervention is phased into the control group after T1 = T periods. First consider a situation in
which the outcomes Yijt are observed (K + 1) times, at t = 0, T, · · · , KT (“calendar time”). Following the event-study notation, denote “relative time” to treatment Kjt = t − Tj 21 . This denotes
20
Phase-in RCT designs — also called stepped-wedge designs — appear to be less common in the health research
literature.
21
The setup here ensures that for both the treatment and the control group, Kjt ∈ {0, T, · · · , KT } and take the

31

the amount of time group j has already been exposed to the intervention at time t. We specify the
data-generating process to be
Yijt = αt +

K
X

τk 1{Kjt = kT } + ijt

(1)

k=0

and make the following assumptions:
Assumption 1, Stable Dynamic Effects The pattern of dynamic treatment effects (the τk
terms) is the same in the treatment group and the control group. This holds if the dynamic
treatment effects do not interact with (calendar) time, for example.
Assumption 2, Validity of Randomization Absent the intervention, the outcomes of the units
in the treatment and control groups follow the same trends.
Assumption 3, Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption The intervention on the treatment
units does not have effects on the outcomes of the control units.
The first assumption is standard for event-study designs (Borusyak & Jaravel, 2016), but it is
somewhat restrictive, as discussed below. The last two are standard assumptions for most RCTs.
Note that this flexible setup imposes minimal assumptions on the dynamics of the treatment
effects. The treatment effects can be increasing or decreasing over time, and can even reverse signs
after a certain period.
Under the three assumptions described above, and most importantly, the stable dynamic effects
assumption, the difference between treatment and control groups before the program rolls-out to
the control group identifies the effects of the program in the first T periods. These estimates can
then be used to compute the counterfactual of the control group (if they had been left untreated)
to back out long-term impacts after full program roll-out. The long-term effects at t = 2T , for
example, would be the sum of the difference between treatment and control groups at t = T and
at t = 2T ; in other words, the counterfactual outcome for the control group at t = 2T is simply its
actual value minus the estimated effect T periods after the treatment, which is imply the difference
between the treatment and control groups at time t = T . With the same logic, the long-term effects
at t = 3T would be the sum of the difference between treatment and control groups at t = T , at
t = 2T , and at t = 3T . One can extend this to t = KT , the completed period for which we have
measurements of the outcomes, although intuitively, summing up these treatment effect estimates
will lead to larger standard errors as t grows.
An important result is that sufficiently frequent measurement is essential. Identification is
possible only if the measurements are carried out at least every T periods, otherwise one simply
cannot identify the effects in the initial few periods, and cannot compute longer term effects using
the approach described above. However, in the case where the initial measurement is done after
phase-in of the control group, if we are willing to make the assumption that the effects of additional
exposure is non-negative, the difference between treatment and control groups provides a lower
bound of the true treatment effect.
When we run the regression of the form
Yijt = αt +

τ̂k 1{Kjt = kT } + ijt

(2)

k=0

same set of values. When this is not the case, interpolation is necessary, as is the case for Bandiera et al. (2017). They
took measurements in year 2, 4 and 7, and their control group was treated in year 4. They interpolate between 2and 4-year estimates of effects for the treatment group to derive a counterfactual 3-year effect for the control group,
in order to estimate treatment effects after 7 years.

homoskedasticity)

Var(τ̂k ) = (k + 1)σ 2
(3)
N
where σ is the residual standard error of the regression22 . It is clear that the variance of treatment
effect estimates grows linearly over time (namely, as observations are farther from the time of
control group phase-in), as opposed to staying relatively stable over time, as would be the case for
a non-phase-in RCT design.
Despite reduced precision for (absolute) long-term estimates in a phase-in design, this approach
actually yields more precise estimates for the differential effects. These estimates may be of particular interest if one is interested in testing certain hypotheses, such as whether effects grow or fade
out over time. This is because these estimates are taken directly from comparing the treatment and
control groups at a point in time, and are not computed by summing up or differencing multiple
estimates. For example, suppose we want to know whether the treatment effect after T periods
is the same as the effect after 2T . In a standard non-phase-in RCT design, one would have to
test the equality between the treatment effect estimates in t = 2T versus t = T . In a phase-in
design, however, one can take the treatment effect estimate at t = 2T directly, yielding more precise
estimates than the former method.
Bandiera et al. (2017) employ a related approach. They evaluate an intervention that was
phased in to control groups after four years, and compute a range of estimates for the treatment
effects after seven years. Rather than calculating standard errors using an analogue of the procedure
above, they check for robustness by using the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile Quantile Treatment
Effect estimates on the 3-year effects to create counterfactuals for the phased-in controls 7 years
after the program had started. As they measured 2-year and 4-year effects in practice, they need
to impose some additional assumptions for interpolation to get the 3-year effects. Adjusting the
standard errors with our calculation above leads to somewhat wider confidence intervals than with
their approach; one can reject the hypothesis of no long-term effects, however, so the results remain
robust under the approach outlined in this article. Note that the phase-in design allows them to
demonstrate that effects are in fact increasing over time, even though standard errors on the 7 year
effect are fairly large.
While the economics literature generally assumes that the path of dynamic effects does not
vary with time (Borusyak & Jaravel, 2016), in many contexts, the dynamic path of treatment
effects would vary with either the age of participants, or other factors that are time-varying, such
as the prevalence and intensity of a disease. Identification of long-run effects will still be possible
if there is a sufficient sample size and sufficient variation in child age (or prevalence and intensity
of a disease) among the treatment and control samples, to separately identify the dynamic path
of effects for children of different ages (or in contexts with different prevalence and intensity of
the disease). However, this would be impossible if time and age (or prevalence and intensity) are
perfectly correlated. For example, if all the treatment and control group individuals are 4 years
old at t = 0 when the treatment group receives a health intervention, and if the control group
receives the intervention at t = 3 (three years later), to estimate long-term effects, we would have
to make the perhaps implausible assumption that effects on 4-year-olds are the same as effects on
7-year-olds.
22

The derivation is shown in Appendix C.

33

While we show that long-run effects may be econometrically identified even with phase-in designs, they will at best be estimated with more noise, and so our view is that experimental research
designs with pure control groups are generally preferable to phase-in designs, when it is ethically
and politically feasible to use them.
The other basic building block of a randomized controlled trial is an adequate sample size.
However, many trials are underpowered to detect modest yet economically meaningful treatment
effects, partly because researchers often face a trade-off between the number of treatment arms
and statistical power. Croke et al. (2016), for example, showed that out of the 22 studies that
estimate the impacts of mass deworming, the median sample size for non-clustered RCTs is only
198 individuals, and the median sample size for clustered RCTs is 80 clusters. For assessing longterm impacts, concerns about power are particularly relevant, because sample attrition may further
erode statistical power. One may combine data from individual papers and conduct meta-analyses
in order to gain more statistical power and make progress in this area. Study sample size plays a
role in our selection criteria, as described in Section 4, and Appendix A and B.

4.2.1

Data
Follow-up Surveys

Table 1 illustrates that follow-up surveys are the most common source of data used to conduct
long-run evaluations of RCTs in international development. The choice to use survey data appears
to often be made out of necessity: in most low-income countries, relevant administrative data at the
individual level is either non-existent or difficult to obtain. Even when they exist and are accessible,
administrative records may only capture a small share of the outcomes of interest to development
economists. For instance, few low-income countries rigorously measure informal economic activity,
self-employment earnings, or subsistence agricultural production, and even when they do, data
may only exist for a small subset of the population (which may not overlap with the population
studied in an RCT). It is not a coincidence that the rise in field experiments and original survey
data collection in development economics have gone hand in hand over the past twenty years.
Individual or household level surveys have many strengths, but also key limitations. The most
important upside of original survey data is the researcher’s ability to design her own questions to
effectively answer the question at hand. Many recent household surveys in development economics
collect highly detailed measures of demographic, educational, health, psychological, and labor market and enterprise outcomes. The richness of original survey data, and the fact that questions
can be tailored to particular study goals, allows researchers to probe the mechanisms underlying
any intervention impacts, and explore heterogeneity in treatment effects across subgroups. It has
become a rite of passage for young development economists to spend extended periods of time in
the field designing and piloting survey questions, improving the implementation of data collection
processes, and sitting in on countless surveys with trained enumerators. In our view, a positive
byproduct of these real-world experiences is often a better understanding of the study setting.
Two frequent downsides of original survey data collection are cost and attrition. Relative to
the cost of simply downloading existing administrative records, original survey data collection
of thousands of respondents is extremely expensive, with typical project budgets running into
the hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Of course, downloading relevant administrative data is
usually simply not an option in development economics.) Second, follow-up surveys often suffer
from considerable sample attrition. As illustrated in Table 1, several prominent existing long-

34

run follow-ups feature high attrition rates, including 40% in the INCAP nutritional supplement
study, 49% in the TEEP cognitive stimulation study and nearly 40% in Progresa (Behrman et al.,
2011). Sample attrition appears to be particularly severe in settings where migration — both
domestic and international — is common, and among adolescent and young adult populations
that are particularly mobile geographically as they seek out educational, labor market and family
opportunities.
Fortunately, several more recent long-term tracking efforts, such as the Indonesia Family Life
Survey (IFLS) (Strauss et al., 2016; Thomas et al., 2001, 2012), the Kenya Life Panel Survey
(KLPS) and the Ghana study mentioned above (Duflo et al., 2018) report much lower sample attrition rates. These surveys all devote considerable resources to tracking and re-contacting original
participants, which is critical for reducing non-random attrition and improving data quality. To
illustrate, the IFLS5 round tracked 92% of the original households after 21 years. This is despite
the high geographic mobility of the baseline respondents: in the fourth wave in 2007, over one-third
had moved from the community in which they were interviewed at baseline. For KLPS3, the effective tracking rate is 84% after 15 years and is not significantly different between the deworming
treatment and control groups (Baird et al., 2018). Encouragingly, Table 1 indicates that several
recent studies have even higher survey respondent tracking rates over periods of roughly a decade.
How have these projects improved long-term tracking and achieved such low attrition rates?
In the next few paragraphs, we document several key lessons from the pioneering IFLS project
(Thomas et al., 2001, 2012). Several of the authors of the current article also have first-hand
experience in respondent tracking from KLPS and the Ghana study, and it is also worth stating
several lessons that we have learned along the way (Baird et al., 2008).
A first key lesson is that the detailed contact information of the respondent, as well as of
their close relatives and neighbors, should be collected as early as possible in the data collection
effort. Starting from the first wave, IFLS began collecting the current residential locations of all
households, a sketch map with landmarks and a description of how to find the location, landline
and mobile phone numbers, email addresses, people who would likely know their whereabouts in
the future and their contact information, whether respondents are planning to move and the likely
destinations, and so on (Thomas et al., 2012). When tracking respondents, a field team needs as
many “leads” as possible. By the time several years have passed since an intervention started,
it may simply be too late to gather this type of data on respondents who are already on the
move. Similarly, it is important to renew contact with respondents relatively frequently — in our
experience, at least every few years — to prevent residential location information from becoming
stale.
A second observation is that respondent tracking has become considerably easier over the past
decade or so in many low-income countries as mobile phone penetration has expanded, becoming
nearly universal in many societies. At the start of early KLPS follow-up rounds (approximately
15 years ago), launching a tracking round meant revisiting the original villages and schools of the
school deworming project; today, a follow-up round is launched with a barrage of cell phone calls
and texts to respondents and their relatives, to figure out if they have moved and to set up inperson interviews. In the Ghana study, the research team even provided cell phones to respondents
at baseline to facilitate later follow-up contacts (although this step may become unnecessary over
time as larger shares of individuals own mobile phones). The cost savings and logistical gains for
researchers generated by new communication technologies have been immense.
Third, we have observed that respondent tracking in KLPS actually appears to become some-

35

what easier as respondents age out of their 20’s and into their 30’s, as many individuals appear to
settle into more stable family, work, and residential arrangements. If a panel survey data collection
effort can “get through” the more difficult adolescent and young adult period unscathed, there is
hope for more consistently high tracking rates in midlife and beyond.
Fourth, in many low-income countries, including Kenya, there is substantial mobility across
national borders. The KLPS project has always had a policy of tracking respondents who move
internationally, via phone or Skype surveys, if necessary, in order to limit attrition. While the costs
of international tracking can be substantial, it is critical for successful long-run follow-up surveys
in many settings. We note that the KLPS survey was launched in a Kenyan region that features
a fairly open border with Uganda (and strong family, ethnic and historic ties across the border),
which greatly facilitates both international mobility and international tracking; the situation along
other borders may be more challenging, for instance, currently when it comes to the case of Mexican
and Central American migrants who have moved to the U.S.
Finally, the IFLS research team documents many differences between “movers” and “stayers”,
including in exhibiting significantly different observed returns to education in IFLS4 (in 2007)
(Thomas et al., 2012). This indicates that treatment effect estimates generated in samples that
exclude “movers” could be biased. Similarly, in the KLPS-3 analysis described above, deworming
treatment has substantial positive long-run impacts on the likelihood of urban migration, which
suggests that excluding the subsample of movers from the analysis could again lead to bias. Taken
together, investing in tracking study respondents across space will likely be valuable for most longrun research projects.
4.2.2

Administrative Data

Administrative data can be a highly cost-effective alternative to follow-up surveys, in cases where
relevant administrative data are available and the baseline surveys contain information that allows
them to match to offical records (for instance, a government ID number). Bettinger et al. (2018),
for example, achieved very high tracking rates among PACES school voucher lottery participants in
Colombia, with 97% of participant identification numbers being valid. These individuals can then
be matched to five distinct government administrative datasets with minimal attrition, and no need
for costly follow-up surveys since the government is already collecting this data. For labor market
outcomes, the authors are able to match roughly participants to formal sector earnings and tax
payment records in the 2008–2014 SISPRO dataset (from Colombia’s Social Protection Ministry)
as well as with Familias en Accion conditional cash transfer and other social protection program
eligibility information in the SISBEN survey. For those living in low-income neighborhoods they
also obtain self-reported earnings. The administrative data approach in Bettinger et al. (2018) is
extremely cost-effective and yields a rich set of outcome data.
It seems clear to us that administrative data should be used when high-quality information on
relevant measures is available and can be matched to study participants; the key constraint is that
this has rarely been the case in practice, and is especially rare in the poorest developing countries
(note that Colombia is a middle income country). In assessing the feasibility of additional long-run
follow-up projects, researchers could consider the presence of good administrative data, such as in
Colombia, as an important criterion.
When there are no unique identifiers in place to help researchers match records in different
datasets, using “probabilistic matching” techniques — matching on individual characteristics such
as names, neighborhoods, addresses, birth places, birth dates, etc. can be an attractive alternative.
36

In Venezuela, Hsieh et al. (2011) matched the list of petition signers who opposed the Hugo Chávez
regime to household survey respondents in order to estimate the economic effects of being identified
as a Chávez political opponent. Even without an official ID number, the authors successfully
matched most records based on locality, exact birth date, and gender.
Yet administrative data also have some drawbacks. As mentioned above, administrative records
will typically not contain all of the outcomes or measures that researchers are interested in. Where
subsistence agriculture and informal sector economic activities are widespread, as in many lowincome countries, administrative data will likely miss important components of total household
earnings. To some extent this concern can be ameliorated if there exist proxy means-tested programs
(for poverty alleviation), with accompanying administrative records, but the surveys that go into
determining eligibility may only be collected infrequently or cover limited geographic areas.
Similar strategies have been pursued in another Latin American environment by Molina Millán
et al. (2018b). They evaluate PRAF-II, a conditional cash transfer program in Honduras, using
microdata from the national population census and repeated cross-sectional surveys collected more
than a decade after the program’s start. They assign individual program treatment status based
on their municipality of birth, in what is essentially an intention to treat design, given that municipalities were the unit of randomization. However, administrative data here again has some limits:
the use of aggregated municipal level data can lead to risk of bias if there is extensive migration
and asymmetric mobility across treatment and control areas, for instance.
4.2.3

New Data Sources

An emerging body of studies has leveraged new data and methods from economics, computer science
(specifically machine learning), and earth sciences to measure poverty, and these have some promise.
In principle, these methods could offer cost-effective and scalable ways to evaluate international
development interventions in a timely manner, especially in cases where original data collection
is challenging, such as societies experiencing armed conflict. The key caveat to most of these
methods is that they are limited in terms of the outcomes that researchers can examine, falling
far short of the richness of found in most original development economics household surveys in
their measurement of living standards, consumption, and income, and they typically have nothing
to say about economically important attitudes, beliefs and expectations, let alone direct health or
nutritional measures.
An early application of new data to estimate RCT impacts is the Alix-Garcia et al. (2013)
study, which uses Landsat satellite data to study the ecological consequences of the Mexican PROGRESA/Oportunidades program. Remote sensing data appears particularly well-suited to study
impacts of cluster-randomized interventions (like this Mexico RCT), where treatment and control
geographic areas can be easily identified. Researchers may not always have adequate resolution, or
relevant geolocation data, to identify treatment and control households when randomization is done
within a village. However, there are exceptions: Burke & Lobell (2017) combined high-resolution
satellite imagery (1m Terra Bella imagery) and intensive field sampling on thousands of smallholder
maize fields over two years, and they detected positive crop yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid
seed inputs; see also Jean et al. (2016). Satellite data has also been used to generate nightlight
intensity measures, which have recently become very widely used to proxy for overall local economic
activity (Henderson et al., 2012), and once again these could be useful for the evaluation of RCTs
where the unit of randomization is fairly large.
More recently, researchers are leveraging cell phone records to assess poverty. The seminal
37

paper by Blumenstock et al. (2015) shows that machine learning methods can be used to predict
household wealth and living standards measures from detailed mobile phone meta data in Rwanda.
Blumenstock et al. (2018) apply this method to impact evaluation: they recruited mobile phone
subscribers in Afghanistan to participate in a 7-month high-frequency phone-based survey, and
matched their responses to historical call detail records. They were able to infer the onset and
magnitude of positive and negative economic shocks, including the (randomized) receipt of cash
transfers. In cases where cell phone meta-data is available to researchers, baseline survey data
collection could usefully collect participants’ mobile phone numbers, which could later be matched
to call detail records, and together with the appropriate prediction methods, these can generate
estimates of living standards.
Yet Blumenstock (2018) also warns that these new data sources may suffer from a lack of
validation and biased algorithms. For instance, there is some evidence that existing predictive
models may work in one institutional context but not be nearly as successful in others. The number
of international phone calls made, for example, is a better predictor of wealth in Rwanda than it is
in Afghanistan. Predictive model performance also appears to deteriorate rather quickly over time,
raising questions about how often the models need to be re-validated, and at what cost in terms of
fresh “training data”. In addition, the behavioral patterns currently used for prediction may change
when individuals become aware that their personal data is being observed and used to generate
statistics that affect eligibility for particular government programs, for instance. Moreover, when
these predicative models are trained on biased or patchy data, those who are poorly represented
(e.g., household too poor to own a smart phone) may be further marginalized, and predictions for
important sub-populations largely uninformative.
The bottom line on new data sources is similar to administrative data: they are cheaper to
collect than traditional household surveys and should be used when available, but may lack the
specific measures needed to test many important economic research hypotheses. As a result, we
do not see original household data collection disappearing from the development economics toolkit
anytime soon, including in the context of long-run studies.

CONCLUSION

In this article, we argue that the coming years provide an exceptional opportunity for development
economists to make intellectual progress in understanding the underlying determinants of long-run
living standards, by exploiting the large number of development RCTs that have been conducted
since the late 1990’s. Despite the methodological and data limitations of many early RCTs in
development economics and public health, we identify dozens of studies that currently appear
amenable to follow-up evaluations, with scores if not hundreds more “aging into” the possibility
of long-run evaluation in the coming decade. If the development economics research community is
able to seize this opportunity, it has the potential generate considerable scientific progress in our
field.
Given the policy relevance and intellectual importance of long-term impact evaluations, we argue that this research agenda should be a top priority for donors and policymakers. Conducting
long-term follow-up studies on past RCTs will demand a large amount of funding and coordinated
researcher effort to set up successful survey data collection, often across geographical areas and
sometimes across academic disciplines. Yet establishing parallel data collection and tracking protocols across multiple interventions could help generate comparable estimates on the long-run impacts
38

of related interventions, leading to greater external validity. There are already models of successful
efforts along these lines. Banerjee et al. (2015b), for example, evaluated a multifaceted program
targeted at the very poor in six different countries, and a similar effort is underway in the political economy of development through the EGAP Metaketa initiative (EGAP, 2018). Comparable
long-term evaluations of multiple international development interventions will advance intellectual
understanding of the drivers of long-run living standards, and could generate valuable insights into
comparative cost-effectiveness for policymakers.
We also describe patterns in the relatively small but growing body of literature that already
takes advantage of experimental variation to study long-run living standards impacts. One emerging
pattern is that several human capital interventions — in both health and education — appear to
have successfully led to persistent economic productivity gains, often with impressive rates of return
(Baird et al., 2016a). In contrast, most interventions aimed at relaxing liquidity constraints and
stimulating firm growth appear to be characterized by positive short-term effects that fade out over
time (with the exception of “graduation” programs that are characterized by large asset transfers
and intensive training and support). This pattern echoes the lack of persistent or meaningful
impacts documented in the microcredit literature (see, for example, Banerjee et al. (2015a)). Yet
we caution that this pattern is driven by a relatively small number of RCT studies, and must be
viewed as suggestive at this time. With the appropriate resources and coordination, the body of
evidence on long-run impacts of these and other development interventions is poised to become
much more definitive in the coming years.

Study Screening Procedure for Cash Transfer Studies

Figure A.1 documents the selection process for cash transfer studies. We first identified seven recent
meta-analysis studies conducted between 2009 and 2017 (de Walque et al., 2017; Bastagli et al.,
2016; Baird et al., 2014; Saavedra et al., 2012; Arnold et al., 2011; Owusu-Addo et al., 2018; Fiszbein
& Schady, 2009), from which we extracted 170 publications. To further restrict our attention to
the most promising studies, we exclude a study if the study exhibits any of the following features.
1. The study is not randomized experiments.
We focus on RCTs in order to minimize the risks of including studies that could suffer from
internal validity issues.23
2. The intervention started after 2010.
The cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, but corresponds roughly to the lower bound of the time
necessary for most recipients to enter the labor force.
3. The study is not sufficiently powered.
Long-term evaluations are likely to suffer from a reduction in statistical precision, notably
due to attrition in long-term tracking (see Section 4). A small sample size can lead to
lack of statistical power in the long-term evaluation and yield ambiguous and uninformative
results. Predicting long-term effect sizes is difficult, given the heterogeneity of interventions
and institutional and economic contexts. Long-term impacts can be larger than short-term
impacts if the intervention sets the beneficiaries onto a different life trajectory, as in the
Jamaica study (Gertler et al., 2014). However, short-term health or cognitive impacts may
also dissipate over time, or translate only partly into labor market outcomes. Fading out of
effects in certain interventions is also common, such as in the entrepreneurial grant program
in Uganda (Blattman et al., 2018b). This possibility requires researchers to follow up with
experiments that are at least sufficiently powered at baseline. As a rule of thumb, we choose
the famous Jamaica experiment (Grantham-McGregor et al., 1991) with a sample size of
129 as our benchmark study24 . Assuming that the Type I error α = 0.05, the Type II error
κ = 0.80, treatment and control groups are of the same size P = 0.50, and full compliance, we
estimate the ex-ante Minimum Detectable Effects (MDE) to be about 0.5 σ 25 . We therefore
use 0.5 standard deviation (SD) as our power benchmark, which translates into roughly a
sample size of 65 in individual per branches randomization designs or 9 clusters per branch
for clustered RCT’s, assuming an intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 10%, and a group size
of 100. Note that this benchmark is considered as the bare minimum of the sample size:
depending on the context, a larger sample size may be necessary.
23

Including high quality non-randomized studies as in Molina Millán et al. (2018a) would have required us to take
a stance on whether the assumptions underlying the non-experimental estimators are valid. Such assessments are
often subjective. We restrict the scope of this review to randomized experiments.
24
We regroup the treatment arms into cognitive stimulation versus control, ignoring the nutritional supplement
treatment, as in Gertler et al. (2014).

Using these criteria, we identify 26 RCT’s that may be eligible for a follow-up study. We screen
these trials further qualitatively, based on the three criteria described below.
1. Initial implementation quality.
We analyze the quality of the original research design and its implementation. We examine
whether there may be major spillover effects, whether the control groups have been accidentally treated or contaminated, whether there are any baseline imbalances, or compromises
of the randomization design due to ethical or logistical concerns, and whether there are any
other difficulties in implementing the research design.
2. Sufficient difference in treatment and control exposure.
As discussed in Section 4, many studies employ a phase-in design to ensure fairness in aid
distribution, creating difficulty in long-term evaluations. We do not always exclude studies
with phase-in designs. Instead, we make a qualitative assessment as to whether the intensity
of the intervention in the treatment group is sufficiently larger than that in the control group
to allow for long-term impacts’ estimation.
3. Plausibility of tracking households and individuals in the long run.
In our view, the quality of the short-run tracking informs us about whether long-run tracking
can be successful. That said, we recognize that attrition rates are not always monotonically
increasing, and respondents who were previously attrited could be re-surveyed with more
efforts by the research team.
We grade each study “pass”, “fail” or “unclear” for each criteria. We then exclude any study
with one or more “fail”s. By these standards, we exclude eight studies26 . CCT China (Mo et al.,
2013) and CT-OVC (Asfaw et al., 2014) were excluded because of severe baseline imbalances. HSNP
(Merttens et al., 2013) and MPP (Robertson et al., 2013) were excluded because of severe attrition.
NMMT (Aker, 2017) was excluded because it did not have a pure control group. PKH (Alatas et al.,
2011) was excluded because some of the control localities received PKH funds through an early and
unanticipated expansion of the program, while implementation in some of the treatment localities
was delayed. Two additional studies were excluded because we consider them to be outside of the
scope of cash transfers. GLSS5+ (Karlan et al., 2014) studies rainfall insurances, and only uses
cash transfers as a kind of “control” group. ESHE (Duflo et al., 2015) was an in-kind transfer
study. The 18 studies described in Table 2 correspond to the final selected studies.

Study Screening Procedure for Child Health Studies

In this review, we classify child health interventions into five categories: (1) nutritional supplementation; (2) perinatal interventions (e.g., general training and/or support groups for women, breastfeeding, responsive feeding, kangaroo mother care, cord cleansing)27 ; (3) interventions targeted at
specific disease (e.g., deworming, HIV prevention or testing, malaria prevention, diarrhoea); (4)
sanitation interventions; and (5) psychosocial stimulation.
26

The spreadsheet documenting the selection process is available upon request. Study acronyms are not necessarily
official.
27
All the nutritional interventions targeting pregnant women are classified as nutritional supplementation.

50

Figure B.1 demonstrates a similar selection process as that in Appendix A. We first identified
20 meta-studies28 across all domains of child health (Conde-Agudelo & Dı́az-Rossello, 2016; Gertler
et al., 2015; De-Regil et al., 2013; Elder et al., 2014; Farnsworth et al., 2014; Hill et al., 2004; iLiNS,
2017; Imdad et al., 2017, 2013; Sinha et al., 2015; Larsen et al., 2017; Levin & Brouwer, 2014; Singh
et al., 2013; Speich et al., 2016; Strunz et al., 2014; Yousafzai & Aboud, 2014; Zwane & Kremer,
2007; Eilander et al., 2009; Meager, 2017; Polec et al., 2015). Then, based on a similar set of
criteria, we identified 77 potential studies, as shown in Table 3, that includes 32 nutrition studies
and Appendix Table B.1 that includes 45 non-nutrition studies.
We note an important difference of our strategy here as compared to that in Appendix A. In
the public health literature, we are more able to leverage the meta analyses that sometimes have
already implemented similar selection criteria and constructed databases of relevant studies. We
rely on the pre-screening process in these systematic reviews to extract a few promising trials from
the vast universe of relevant studies. A rather drastic example of this is Imdad et al. (2013), which
reviewed 2303 article records on umbilical cord cleansing in developing countries, and eventually
identified only three trials that satisfy their screening criteria.
Given how broad the definition for “child health intervention” is, and how expansive the literature is, we cannot be sure that the list of studies presented in Table B.1 encompasses all the
existing RCT’s that have potentials for future follow-ups — some studies may not have appeared
in the meta analyses that we identified. For this reason, we welcome and appreciate additions from
fellow researchers.

28
The total number of meta-analysis identified so far is actually 36. Because of time constraints, we decided to focus
on the 20 most recent meta-analysis. As a result, our estimation of the total number of potential health publications
is probably underestimated. Updates on the selection process are available upon request.

Mathematical Appendix

Here we present the derivation of Equation 3 in the text. Consider a setup similar to that of
Borusyak & Jaravel (2016), in which a panel of units (individuals or clusters) i = 1, · · · , 2N
are randomized into two (equally sized) groups j = 0, 1 which are the control group (or “late
treatment” group) and the treatment group (or “early treatment” group), respectively. Suppose
that the treatment group receive the treatment at period T0 = 0 and the intervention is phased into
the control group after T1 = T periods. Consider first a situation in which the outcomes Yijt are
observed (K + 1) times at t = 0, T, · · · , KT (“calendar time”). Following the event-study notation,
denote “relative time” Kjt = t − Tj . This denotes the amount of time group j has been exposed to
the intervention. If we specify the data-generating process to be
Yijt = αt +

K
X

τk 1{Kjt = kT } + ijt

(4)

τ̂k 1{Kjt = kT } + ijt

(5)

k=0

We run the regression of the form
Yijt = αt +

K
X
k=0

Proposition With standard assumptions, the variance of τ̂k is
Var(τ̂k ) =

2
(k + 1)σ 2
N

(6)

where σ 2 is the residual standard error of the regression.
Proof With standard assumptions (including homoskedasticity)
Var(τ̂k ) = σ 2 Ωkk

(7)

where σ is the residual standard error of the regression and Ωkk is the k-th diagonal term in matrix
Ω where
Ω = [X T X]−1
(8)
where X is a matrix of all the independent variations, including the time fixed effects. Given the
setup, we can explicitly express the dummies (with relative time dummies on the left and calendar
time dummies on the right) as the block matrix
