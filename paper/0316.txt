February 1979
The Effect of Demographic Factors on Age-Earnings Profiles
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the effect of the increased number of young
persons on the job market on their earnings relative to the earnings
of older workers.

The principal finding is that the age-earnings

profile of male workers appears to be significantly influenced by
the age composition

o~

the work force.

When the number of young workers

increased sharply in the 1970s, the profile lItwisted l l against them, apparently
because younger and older male workers are imperfect substitutes in production.
The effect of changes in the relative numbers of workers of different ages
on age-earnings profiles is especially marked among college graduates.
By contrast, the age-earnings profile of female workers, which tends to be
quite flat, appears to be little influenced by the age composition of the
female work force, possibly because the intermittent work experience of women
makes younger women and older women closer substitutes in production.
Whether the sizeable decline in the earnings of the large cohort of
young workers entering the market in the 1970s relative to the earnings of
older cohorts will persist, creating a lifetime lI s ize of cohort" earnings
effect, or whether the new entrants of the 1970s will significantly catch up
in earnings in future years remains to be seen.

The dependence of the age-

earnings profile on demographically-induced movements along a relative demand
schedule suggests that standard human capital models of the profile, which
posit that earnings rise with age or experience solely as a result of individual investment behavior are incomplete.

Because of the "baby boom" that

1955~60

(U.S. Bureau of the Census,

1977, p. 56), there was an especially significant change in the age
structure of the U.S. work force in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
when the number of young persons increased extremely rapidly.
From 1966 to 1976 the number of labor force participants aged 20-24 grew
from 9.7 million to 16.7 million while the number aged 25-34 grew from
16.9 million to 23.0 million.

The ratio of participants less than 35

years of age to participartts 35 and over jumped from .46 to .67.

What are the consequences for the wage structure of such sizeable
changes in the age composition of the labor force?

Does an increase in

the relative number of young workers alter their wages relative to the
wages of older workers?

To what extent do cross-sectional age-earnings

profiles respond to exogenous demographic shifts?

What are the possible

implications of the experience of the late 1960s and 1970s for the
decade of the 1980s, whert the number of young workers is expected to decline?
The answen ·to these questions depend on the degree of flexibility
of relative wages by age or, in the context of standard labor demand
analysis, on elasticities of complementarity (Hicks, Sato and Koizuma)
which link changes in factor prices to changes in the supply of inputs.
If the relevant elasticities are large, changes in the age composition
of the labor force can substantially alter age-earnings profiles whereas

2

if the elasticities are small, profiles will be relatively independent of
the number of workers in different age groups.
This paper studies the effect of changes in the age structure of
the work force on age-earnings profiles in the U.S. and provides estimates
of the relevant elasticities of complementarity for young and older workers.
It focuses in particular on developments h the late 1960s and in the 1970s,
when the relative number of young workers increased sufficiently rapidly
as to: provide a strong "test" of .the potential dependence of the profile
on exogenous shifts in the age structure of the labor supply.

Section three develops the relevant labor

demand and production function models needed to analyze the link between
changes in the age structure of the work force and changes in age-earnings
profiles.

Section four estimates the extent to which shifts in age-

earnings profiles can be attributed to demographically induced movements
along labor demand schedules whose magnitude is reflected in the relevant
eiasticities of eomplementarity.
The principal finding is that the age-earnings profile of male workers,
which has traditionally been viewed as a stable economic relation determined
by human capital investment decisions, appears to be significantly influenced
by the age composition of the work force.

Apparently because younger and

older male workers are imperfect substitutes in production, changes in the
number of young male workers relative to older male workers substantially
influences the ratio of the earnings of younger men to the

The effect of changes in the relative numbers of workers of different
ages on age-earnings profiles is especially marked among college graduates.
By contrast, the age-earnings profile of female workers, which tends to be
quite flat, appears to be little influenced by the age composition of the
female work force, possibly because the intermittent work experience of
women makes younger women and older women closer substitutes in production.
Whether the sizeable decline in the earnings of the large cohort of
young workers entering the market in the 1970s relative to the earnings of
older cohorts will persist, creating a lifetime "size of cohort" earnings
effect, or whether the new entran1B of the 1970s will significantly catch
up in earnings in future years remains to be seen.
The dependence of the age-earnings profile on demographically-induced
movements along a relative demand schedule suggests that standard human
capital models of the profile, which posit that earnings rise with age or
experience solely asa result of individual investment behavior are
incomplete.

If, as found in this study, elasticities of substitution

or complementarity among age groups are not infinite, human capital
cannot be treated as a homogeneous input with a single rental price,
whose "units" of investment determine the age-earnings prof iles.
Differences in the activities of young and old workers and the underlying
demand for those activities decisively influence the shape of the profile.
To understand the relation between earnings and age, it is necessary to
analyze the demand for workers by age and employer personnel policies
as well as to analyze human capital investment dec isions.

The Changing Age Struc ture of the Work Fo:.ce
The broad outlines of the remarkable change in the age structure of

the work force of the United States under investigation is examined in
Table 1, which records the absolute number of workers aged 20-24 and 25-34 and
the number aged 20-24 and 25-34 relative to the number of workers
over for the period 1966 to 1976.

These patterns of

a remarkable increase in the number of

young workers in total, the result of the "baby boom" that followed World
WarII;an even greater percentage increase in the number of young college
graduate workers, the result of the unprecedented proportion of young persons
choosing to enroll in college in the 1960s; and an especially marked
increase in the number of young female workers, the result of a sizeable
jump in the labor participation rate of young women in the late 1960s and
19705.
Among male workers, the numbers aged 20-24 and 25-34 increased by
over one-third from 1966 to 1976 while the number of college graduates aged
20-24 and aged 25-34 more than doubled.

As a result of these changes, the

ratio of all male workers 20-34 to those 35 and over rose from .55 in
1966 to .78 in 1976 while the ratio of male college graduate workers 20-34
years of age to male college graduate workers 35 and over increased from
.62 (1966) to 1.02

(l97~).

According to the figures

in

Panel B, the nnmber

of female workers aged 20-24 increased by 76% while the number aged 25-34 increased by 103%.

These gains outstripped the rate of increase of the older female

work force by sufficient magnitudes to raise the ratio of 20-24 to 35+
year old female workers by 53% and the ratio of 25-34 to 35+ year old female
workers by 76%.

Among college graduate workers, the number of young

5

women aged 20-24 more than doubled while the number aged 25-34 more than
tripled.

While less dramatic, the number of young female high school

graduate workers also increased, particularly in the 25-34 bracket.
Data on the number of new high school and college graduates and on
the number of new graduates entering the labor market tell a similar
story about the influx of young persons into the work force, though the
timing of changes necessarily differs from that in Table 1.

Between

1960 and 1970 the nunber of new high school graduates per thousand persons
1

in the civilian labor force rose from 26.8 to 35.0.-

From 1960 to 1972

the number of high school graduates and dropouts entering the job market
grew from 13.2 per thousand members of the civilian labor force to 17.1
per thousand members of the civilian labor force.

4

For college graduates

the picture is more complex, as the tendency to enroll for graduate studies
in the 1960s delayed the labor market entrance of the large classes of
the sixties until the following decade.

From the late 1960s to the mid 19705,

however, the ratio of new bachelor's graduates on the market to the civilian
labor force increased sharply.

5

Because data on graduates refer to flows rather than stocks of persons
in a wide age grouping, they reveal further the beginning of the decline
in the number of young workers which will mark the 1980s.

From 1972 to

1977 the persons graduating fr011l high school grew by a bare 4% (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, p. 153).

From 1974 to 1976, the number of persons

graduating from college fell by 3.0% (op. cit., p. 153).

The beginning of

the demographic change from the large cohorts of young persons of the late
1960s and 1970s to the smaller cohorts of young persons of the 1980s can
be seen in these figures.

While not a "classical experiment" with all other factors held fixed,
the sizeable increase in the number of young workers found in Table 1
and in the graduates data cited above and the concurrent change in the
age composition of the work force constitutes the type of exogenous
shift in the age composition of the work force that should provide a
reasonably strong test of whether the age-earnings relation depends on
factors beyond investments in training.

Was the change in supply accompanied

by changes in relative wages?

II.

Changes in the Relative Earnings of Young Workers
Evidence on earnings by age from the Current Population Survey of the

Bureau of the Census provides an answer to this question.

The CPS data show

that for male workers, who traditionally have had steep cross-sectional
age-earnings profiles, the demographic changes of the late 1960s and of
the 1970s were accompanied by a substantial "twist" in the age-earnings
profile against the young.

By contrast, among female workers, who have

traditionally had flat age-earnings profiles, the demographic changes do
not appear to have altered the relative wages of the young.

While other

factors (to be explored in section IV) may have also been at work, the
concatenation of increases in relative numbers and decreases in relative
wages in the period is highly suggestive of movement along a negatively
sloped demand curve, with a moderate elasticity of substitution between
workers of different ages.
Table 2 summarizes the CPS evidence on age-earnings profiles in
terms of the ratio of the income or earnings of 45-54 year old workers
to the incomes or earnings of 20-24 or 25-34 year old workers, in toto

8

and for high school graduates and

colle~e

r,raduates taken separately.

The figures in lines 1-8 are taken from the U.S. Bureau of the Census'
Current Population Reports, with the data for 1975 adjusted to take account
of changes in the imputation procedure used by the Census.

As discussed

in Current Population Reports, Consumer Income Series P-60, No. 105,
the Census made major changes in its methbd of computing estimates in
1975 when it introduced a new imputation procedure to estimate
records.

Lines 1-4 treat the mean incomes of all workers who report greater than
zero values for the year.

These incomes are likely to be sensitive to cyclical

changes in unemployment rates.

Lines 5-8 are based on the incomes of year-

round full-time workers, which should be less sensitive to the cycle and
which should offer a better measure of rates of pay than the incomes of all
workers.

For women, the sizeable number of part-time

suggesting that attention be focused on year-round full-time employees.

than total incomes and of covering narrower age groups.

in the ratio of the earnings of 45-49 year olds to the earnings of 25-29 year
olds of 15 points.
The figures for college and high school graduates show further that the
"twist" in male age-earnings profiles was most pronounced for college graduates.
Between 1968 and 1975 the ratio of the incomes of 45-54 year old year-round
and full-time male college graduates to the incomes of 25-34 year old yearround and full-time male college

rose

by

25 percentage points or 18

percent while the comparable ratio for male high school graduates rose by 11
points or 9 percent.

Similarly, for all male college graduates, the ratio of

the incomes of 45-54 year aIds to the incomes of 25-34 year olds rose by 19
percentage points while the ratio of the incomes of high school graduates 45-54
years old to the income of high school graduates 25-34 years old rose by just
9 percentage points.
The data for women tell a different story.

The mean incomes for all

workers show a rise in the income of women aged 45-54 relative to the income
of women aged 20-24 but do not show a rise in the income of women aged 45-54
'to the income of women aged 25-34 and depict a drop in the income of older high
school or college graduate women relative to younger high school or college
graduate women (lines 3,4).

On the other hand, the mean incomes for

year-round and full-time workers show an increase in the ratio of the income

11

of 45-54 year olds compared to the income of 20-24 year olds but not compared to
the incomes of 20-24 year olds.

The unclear pattern in the data may reflect the

general flatness of the age-earnings profile for women, particularly for year-round
and full-time workers.

If the flat profiles result from high substitutnbility

structure of the population would have little or no impact on the

profile~.

Because age-earnings profiles differ markedly between men and women and
appear to have changed only for men in the period covered, the remainder
of this study will focus solely on male age-earnings relations.

The flat

and apparently stable profiles among women suggest very different economic
processes at work, which merit separate detailed study beyond the scope
of the current inquiry.

Analysis of male earnings using CPS data tapes
More precise estimates of the extent of change in the

age-earnin~s

profiles of male workers can be obtained by linear regression analysis of
the effect of age on earnings using the CPS data on individuals that
underlies the published aggregates.

Regression analysis of the data for

individuals has several advantages over comparisons of published means:
it permits investigation of labor market earnings (rather than of incomes,
as given in Current Population Reports Series P-60); it permits calculation
of weekly earnings (yearly earnings over weeks worked) as an indicator
of rate of pay; it allows for greater disaggregation of workers by age
and education; and it can be used more readily to make statistical tests of
the significance of observed changes. 8
To estimate changes in age-earnings profiles among male workers
in the period under study using CPS

dat~

on individuals, the following

linear regression model was fit with the March 1969 and March 1978 tapes
(which give incomes for the preceding year):

The results of the calculations are summarized in Table 3 in terms of differences
between the coefficients on the log earnings of workers aged 45 to 54 and the
coefficients on the log earnings for workers in younger age brackets for persons
with 12 years of schooling (e ..g .. high

~chool

graduates) and for persons with

16 years of schooling (e.g. college graduates), taken separately.

Comparable

estimates for other education groups are also available, but for simplicity are
not given in the table.

In the left side of the table the dependent variable is

the log of weekly earnings, the best measure of rates of pay on the March CPS
files.

The right hand side of the table treats the log of annual earnings.

The

computations confirm the finding of a sizeable decline in the earnings of young
workers relative to the earnings of older workers, particularly among the more
educated.

Among high school graduates, the log weekly earnings of 45-54 year

olds is 18 log points higher relative to the log weekly earnings of 18-24 year
olds in 1977 than in 1968; is .17 points higher relative to the log earnings of
25-29 year olds in 1977 than in 1968; is .09 points higher relative to the log
earnings of 30-34 year olds in 1977 than in 1968; and is 10 points higher relative
to the log earnings of 35-44 year olds in 1977 than in 1968.

Among men

four years of college, the changes are greater, with increases of 30 log
points in the difference between the log earnings of 45-54 year olds and

with

14
the log earnings of 18-24, 25-29, and 30-34 year aIds respectively from
1968 to 1977.

In other education groups, the results are comparable.

While

not all of the changes in the difference in log earnings are significant at
the 5% level, those for the mare educated group are highly significant.
The calculations using log annual earnings tell a similar story, with
the earnings of the older workers rising relative to those of younger
workers, especially among the college educated.
We conclude that there was, in fact, a substantial change in the ageearnings profiles for male workers during the period when the number of
young workers increased relative to the number of older workers.

III.

Labor Demand and Age-Earnings Profiles
In the framework of standard labor demand analysis, the impact of changes

in the relative supply of workers by age on wages depends on the substitutability
of inputs.

When labor of different ages is readily substitutable for other

inputs, large
by age.

changes in supply will cause only modest changes in wages

Conversely, when substitutabil"ity is limited, sizeable changes in

age-earnings profiles are needed for demand to adjust to changes in the age
composition of the work force.

Since the number of workers of different

ages is taken as exogenously determined by demographic changes, the demand
for labor schedule becomes a wage determination schedule, linking factor
prices to factor quantities.

In such a model, Hicks' elasticity of

complementarity, which relates factor prices to inputs (see Hicks, Sato
and Koizuma) is the appropriate elasticity concept, rather than the
standard Allen elasticity of substitution.

In this study I will concentrate

on the inverse of the Hicks elasticity, defined as:

Equation (4) shows lww changes in the quantities of all inputs or changes

To see how changes in inputs alter relative wages, let i index one input
(say older workers) and k index another input (say, younger workers), then
subtract the factor price equation based on (4) for input k from that for
input i to obtain:

When factors other than k and i do not affect the ratio of their marginal

Production functions and elasticities
The relevant elasticities of complementarity or substitution for workers
in different age groups are estimated in this study assuming one of two
functional forms for the production process:

the constant elasticity of

substitution (CES) form and the translogarithmic (TL) form.
The CES form has both desirable and undesirable features for empirical
analysis of the effects of

c~anges

on age-earnings profiles.

On the positive side, since the CES has only one

.

in the relative number of workers by age

elasticity of substitution, the appropriate relative wage equation
is of the form of (6), which is reasonably simple to estimate and which
provides direct information on the impact of relative quantities on relative
earnings.

The possibility that changes in relative wages, of the type

observed in the 1970s, are due largely to cyclical rather than demographic
changes can be readily

The major disadvantage of the CES is that it cannot be used

to test the possibility that in a consistent production function framework
changes in other factors, such as capital, may be influencing the relative
demand for labor of different ages.
The translogarithmic production function provides an appropriate
system for examining the effect of changes in the supply of several inputs
on age-earnings profiles.

The TL form yields a consistent system of

demand equations with potentially different elasticities of complementarity
(or substitution) between any pair of inputs.

Equation (8) relates the share of each input in cost to the

quantities change.

The Hicks elasticities of complementarity can be

Since neither the CES nor TL models of production or demand are without
problems, the effect of the age composition on relative wages by age will
be estimated using both models.

By using two functional forms, each of which

has weaknesses and strengths, I hope to obtain a better fix on the key
demand relation under study than could otherwise be done.

Determinants of Change in Male Age-Earnings Profiles
Table 4 presents estimates of the impact of the ratio of the number of

younger workers to the number of older workers, the state of the business cycle,
and a general trend on the curvature of male age-earnings profiles.

The

dependent variables in the calculations are the log of the income of 45-54
year old men relative to the income of 25-34 year old men (lines 1-5)
and the log of the income of 45-54 year old men relative to the income of
20-24 year old men (lines 6-8).
round full-time workers.

Lines 1"';2 and 6-7 refer to the incomes of year-

As noted earlier, these incomes provide a better

measure of wages than do the incomes of all workers; unfortunately they
are not available until 1955.

Lin~s

3 and 8 treat the ratio of the mean

income of all men with non-zero incomes in the relevant age groups over
the period 1947-1974.

These figures provide additional time series

variation in the data at the expense of potential confounding of changes
in utilization of labor with changes in wage paid.

Lines 4 and 5 consider

the age-earnings profiles of college graduates and high school graduates
separately for the limited number of years for which such figures are
available.
There are three independent variables.

The changing age structure

19

of the work force is measured by the log of the ratio of the number of
male workers aged 45-54 to the number aged 25-34 (lines 1-5) or to the
number aged 20-24 (lines 6-8).

To test the possibility that changes in

relative earnings by age are dominated by cyclical rather than demographic
factors, the calculations also include

a

measure of the state of the business

cycle, the deviation of the log of real gross national product (GNP) from
its trend level:

positive deviations reflect a strong economy while

negative deviations are indicative of recession conditions.

This

measure of the cycle is highly correlated with such alternative busindss
cycle indicators as the rate of unemployment or the difference between actual
and

potential gross national product (see Freeman, 1973).

Because of

the operation of formal seniority systems and because older workers will
have cumulated specific human capital while young workers will not, labor
demand is likely to be more cyclical for young than for older workers,
suggesting that the deviation of real GNP from trend will be negatively
related to the ratio of income of older to younger workers.

The third

independent variable, a time trend, is introduced to control for any of a
variety of factors (greater education of the young, gradual shifts in
industrial structure) which might influence the demand for young as opposed
to older male workers and thus the relevant income ratios.
The regression results suggest that, with trend and cyclical factors
fixed, the relative number of older to younger ·workers has a significant
impact on male age-earnings profiles.

In~e

calculations focusing on tpe

income of 45-54 year aIds relative to 25-34 year aIds, the measure of
relative numbers by age obtains a significant negative coefficient, except
among high school graduates (line 4).

In line I, which analyzes the incomes

20

of year-round and full-time workers with the trend variable omitted, the
log of the ratio of the number of 45-54 year oldto the number of 25-34 year old
workers obtains a coefficient of -.27, three times its standard error.
Inclusion of tthe trend in line 2 reduces the coefficient on relative numbers
substantively, but still leaves a significant relation between relative
numbers by age and relative incomes by age.

In line 3, which treats the

income of all men over the period 1947-1974, the coefficient on the
relative number is a highly significant -.20.
The regressions for the income of year-round full-time workers
aged 45-54 relative to the income of year-round full-time workers aged
20-24 in lines 6 and 7 also yield sizeable significant coefficients for
the relative number of workers by

ag~

though in these cases addition

of the time trend raises rather than reduces the estimated coefficients.
In line 8, by contrast, the ratio of the number of 46-54 year old workers
to the number of 20-24 year aIds has no apparent impact on relative incomes.
This is due largely to the trend term, which is highly collinear with the
relative numbers variable over the period:

with trend deleted, the

coefficient on relative numbers in regressions explaining the ratio of the
income of 45-54 year aIds to the income of 20-24 year aIds is -.31 with a
standard error of .09.
The business cycle indicator, the deviation of real GNP from its
trend has little impact on the income ratios of year-round and full-time
male workers in lines I and 2, suggesting that the wages of 25-34 year
old men are no more sensitive to the cycle than those of 45-54 year old
men.

In the regre"ssion for all male workers in line 3, however, the cyclical

variable is accorded a sizeable effect, which presumably reflects the
greater cyclical sensitivity of the time worked of the younger men.

Much stronger cyclical effects are obtained in the calculations for
the income of 45-54 year old men relative to the income of 20-24
year olds in lines 6-8, indicating that cyclical ups-and-downs have their
greatest impact on the incomes of 20-24 year aIds.
The regressions in lines 4 and 5, which focus on the age-earnings
profiles of collegef,raduates and high school graduates, respectively,
suggest that the increased number of young male workers relative to the
number of older male workers had an especially large impact on college
graduates profiles compared to only a modest impact on high school graduates
profiles.

Similar results based on different models and data, have also

been obtained by other scholars.

Using the Michigan Panel Survey on

Income Dynamics, William Johnson found that the relative size of a
cohort significantly reduced the impact of the earnings of college graduates
but had little effect on the earnings of less educated workers (p. 13).
Using the CPS Demographic files, Finis Welch found a significant effect
of

c~hort

size on earnings in all school groups, with however much

larger elasticities for college graduates.

All of these results suggest

that younger and older workers are better substitutes in the lower
schooling groups than ;:in the college graduate group, and hence that increases in the number of young persons will reduce the earnings
of young high school men.

This is consistent with the much heralded

fall in the rate of return to investment in college education.
The regression estimates in Table 4 can be used to gage the impact
of the demographic, cyclical; and

trend

variables on the 1970s decline

in the relative income of young workers by multiplying the coefficients

on the explanatory variables by the observed changes in the variables.13

According to these calculations, the regression model explains much of the
1968-1974 increased curvature of cross-sectional age-earnings profiles in
terms of the increased number of younger workers relative to the number
of older workers.

Half of the .06 point increase in the log of the ratio of the

income of 45-54 year old to the income of 25-34 year old workers is attributed
to the increase in the number of 25-34 year old workers relative to the number
of 45-54 year old workers while 60% (.11/ .18) of the increase in the log of
the income of 45-54 year aIds relative to the income of 20-24 year aIds is
explained by the increased number of 20-24 year olds relative to the number
of 45-54 year old workers.

The trend variable accounts for the remainder

of the change in the income ratio of 45-54 to 25-34 year olds while the cyclical
variable explains most of the remaining change in the 45-54 to 20-24 year
olds income ratio.
In sum, the estimated effects of demographic, cyclical, and trend
factors using relative income equations based on CES-type functional
forms suggest that the observed twist in the age-earnings profile

24

against young men can be attributed in large part to the changed age
structure of the work force. 14

Translog System Estimates
The effect of changes in the ratio of the number of younger to the
number of older male workers and of changes in the amount of other inputs
on male age-earnings profiles can be analyzed with the translog system of
demand derived equations (9)- (11) .

Such an analysis enables us to check

on the robustness of the results of table 4 under a different functional
specification and to test two competing hypotheses about the
causes of the observed twist in male age-earnings profiles:

1) That the

twist results from increases in the amount of capital, which shifts demand
for labor toward older as opposed to younger workers.

Increases in capital

would have such an effect on demand if, as seems reasonable, capital is
relatively more complementary (less substitutable) with older than with
younger workers.

One reason for expecting relatively greater complementarity

is that skilled labor has been found to be relatively more complementary
with capital than unskilled labor (Griliches).

Since older workers tend to

be more skilled than younger workers, demand for the former could be
expected to be relatively more complementary with

cap~tal.

Another is that

older workers presumably have also accumulated greater specific human capital,
linked to physical capital.

2)

That the twist in the male age-earnings

profiles is due to the influx of female workers, who are better substitutes
for young male workers than for older male workers.

The reason for

expecting greater substitutability between women and younger men than
between women and older men is that women are more likely to be competing
for entry level or early career jobs than for more senior positions in
firms.

If women are better substitutes for the young, then increased numbers

of women workers would raise the earnings of older men relative to younger

25
men.
A translog derived demand system was estimated with the number of fulltime equivalent female workers aged 20-34, the quantity of capital, and
number of full-time male equivalent workers aged 20-34, and the number of
full-time and equivalent male workers aged 35-64 as inputs.

Workers below

the age of 20 were eliminated due to serious problems in estimating their
earnings.

Male workers were divided into two groups due to the problems

of estimating translog systems with more than four inputs using a limited
number of observations. The younger of the two groups, 20-34 year olds, covers
the 20-24 and 25-34 year olds treated in earlier tables.
The inclusion of women and capital in the analysis creates considerable
data problems due to inadequate information on the amount and rewards of
these inputs.

The problem for women is that published CPS figures have

historically reported incomes and the number of persons with income rather than
labor market earnings, and workers with earnings.

Since many women have

income but do not work in the labor market, it is imperative to adjust the
data to take account of this difference.

Comparison of the mean earnings of

women to the mean income of women in recent years when both figures were
published in the Current Population Reports show little differences (less

earn~ngs.

To take account of this problem and of the

part-time work done by many women employees, the number of full-time
equivalent women working in the

u.s.

was estimated by adjusting data from

the Employment and Training Report of the President 1977, by estimates of
weeks worked from the Work Experience of the Population reports of the B.L.S.

26
as described in the table note.

These figures were multiplied by the mean

incomes given in Trends in Income of Families and Persons in the United
States and by mean incomes in the Consumer Income Series P-60, to obtain
factor payments to women.

Comparable estimates of employment of men aged

20-34 and 35-64 were made from the same source and multiplied by the mean
incomes for those age groups to obtain the factor payments going to younger
and older men.
The problem with data on capital is that we lack good information on
both the capital stock and user cost.

An estimate of private capital was

made from data on corporate and noncorporate investment in nonresidential
business capital, provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Musgrave
1976) and unpublished data on goverament capital stock from the same source.
The user cost of capital is based on methodology developed by Jorgenson
and associates.

The particular measure used takes into account the

differential tax treatment of equipment and structures and the presence of
both equity and debt finance, and adjusts the cost of capital for depreciation
and expected capital gains.

It is based on a weighted average of the user

cost of equipment and the user cost of structures, with weights taken as
the share of each in total investment from the National Income and Product
Accounts.

The precise estimating procedure is described in detail in

Clark and Freeman.
The shares of each of the inputs in cost was estimated by dividing
the total factor payments to each by the sum of factor payments.

In the sample

the mean share of national income going to men aged 35-64 was .39; the share
going to men aged 20-34 was .18; the share going to women aged 20-64 was
.12; while the share

go~ng

to capital was .31. Though the data leave much

to be desired, they provide at least a crude means of examining in the context
of the translog specification the effect of the increased supply of women
and capital on the age-earnings profiles of men.

27

Estimates of the constrained translog system were made with an interative
version of Zellner I s minimtnn distance estimator.

Given the constraints, one of

the factor share equations is redundant and can be dropped without affecting
results:

the capital share equation was deleted.

Table 5 records the estimated parameters of the system.

Table 6, presents

the elasticities of complementarity and of factor prices with respect to
changes in quantities derived from the parameters at the mean value of the
shares.

In all cases the elasticities of input prices with respect to the

quantity of the same input are negative, as required by the model.

All of

the labor inputs are complementary with capital (i.e., have positive elasticities
of complementarity).

As hypothesized, however, older men are relatively

more complementary with capital and have a larger elasticity of factor
price with respect to capital than do younger men (the relevant S .. 's are 1.76
~J

for men aged 35-64 and 1.47 for men aged 20-34; the relevant factor price
elasticities are .55 for men aged 35-64 and .46 for men aged 20 to 34).
Contrary to expectation, the number of women is estimated to have a slight
positive effect on the earnings of young men compared to a slight negative
effect on the earnings of older men.

The magnitudes of those elasticities

of complementarity and of the elasticities of factor prices between the
female work force and the two age groups of men are, however, sufficiently
slight as to suggest that male and female workers operate in essentially
separate production processes.

Given the problems noted above in estimating

the input of female labor, however, little weight ought to be given to the
link between the female work force and demand for other factors.
The most important finding from the TL system regressions is that,
consistent with our previous results, the earnings of men aged 20-34 depend
critically on the number of young male workers.

The own elasticity of

complementarity for the number of young men is sizeable negative and far in
excess of the cross-elasticity between young and older men, implying that an
increase in the number of young men would reduct their wage relative to the

28
wage of older men.

Most importantly, the estimated factor price elasticities

indicate that changes in the numbers of male workers of different ages will
substantively influence the earnings of younger and older men and thus are
likely to alter male age-earnings profiles.
The quantitative contribution of changes in the various inputs on
male age-earnings profiles in the period when the profiles changed sharply
can be evaluated by substituting tile estimated elasticities of factor
prices with respect to quantities from table 6 into the relative wage
determination equation (5) derived in section III and multiplying the resultant
coefficients by the actual changes in the inputs.

According to these calculations the increased supply of young men was the
principal factor depressing their earnings relative to the earnings of
older men from the late 1960s to the mid 1970s.l 7

V.

Conclusion
The analysis in this paper has shown that from the late 1960s through

the mid 1970s when the number of young workers increased .rapidly, the
earnings of young male

~rkers

fell relative to the earnings of older male

workers, altering male age-earnings profiles, particularly for college
graduates.

Demand for labor equations based on the constant elasticity of

substitution production function and on the translogarithmic production
f~nction

suggest that the increased number of young male workers was the

major causal force underlying the increased earnings of older men relative
to the earnings of younger men.

Alternative factors that might explain the

observed twist in male age-earnings profiles--the business cycle, general
trends, the increased supply of women, and growth of capital--r07ere found to
have much smaller effects on age-earnings profiles.
The late 1960s to mid 1970s twist in male age-earnings profiles
raises important questions about the effect of the size of a cohort on
the earnings of the cohort and about the economic determinants of crosssectional differences in earnings by age.

Will the relatively low earnings

of the lcrge young cohorts of the 1970s be maintained in the future?

Will

age-earnings profiles change in favor of the prospective small youth
cohorts of the 1980s?

Do demographic swings produce significant inter-

generational income inequality?

How important are differences in the relative

size of cohorts in determining the shape of cross-sectional age-earnings
profiles?

32
Arguments can be advanced for and aga.inst the likely permanance of
a "cohort eff ect" on the earnings of the young (20-34 year old) male
workers of the 1970s.
Three basic forces would appear to operate to create permanent cohort
effects.

First is the tendency of many firms to promote individuals by

seniority along well-defined job ladders and to raise pay through 'standard'
increases over starting rates.

With this type of pay policy a group that

enters the market with low earnings compared to others will never catch up
to the position it would have had had it entered with higher initial earnings.
Second is the possibility that the large young worker cohort of the 1970s
has been "pushed" into jobs with flatter longitudinal age-earnings profiles
than are normally chosen by young workers (as may be occurred among college
graduates, some of whom have been unable to obtain "college type" jobs).
While some of the young may be able to switch to jobs with steeper earnings
trajectories in tl:le future, the overall rate of increase in pay may still
fall short of what would have occurred for a smaller cohort that obtained more
desirable jobs at the outset.

Third, to the extent that future promotions and

raises will be depressed by competition from a large pool of persons in the
same age groups, the large youth cohorts of the 1970s may actually lose ground
in the job market relative to other cohorts in the future.
On the other side of the spectrum, if the low initial earnings of
persons in the 1970s are given a strict investment interpretation, they
suggest that young workers are making greater investments in on-the-job
training than in the past, presumably through selection of "learning
jobs."

This will show up in especially steep longitudinal profiles for

this cohort in the

f~ture

and thus in significant catching up.

Perhaps

more realistically, the likelihood that substitution among workers of
different ages increases with age suggests at least some diminution in

33
the effect of cohort size over time (Welch).
Limited evidence on cohort earnings profiles in the past and on the
jobs held by the new entrants of the 1970s suggests that some permanent
effect of cohort size on earnings is likely.

Ruggles and Ruggles'

analyses of the social security (LEED) data file reveal a noticeable drop
in the longitudinal profile for the cohort which entered the labor force
in about 1930, apparently because 'the labor market conditions at the time
of their entry had a significant depressing effect on their earnings,
relative to those who preceded them and were already established in the
labor market,' whereas the earnings of the cohort born a decade later were
'high relative to the cohorts surrounding them and seem to
this advantage continuously' (p. 124).

hav~

enjoyed

Chamberlain's evidence on the return

to schooling addresses directly the possibility that the relatively depressed
position of young college graduates compared to high school graduates is a
temporary phenomenon due to greater investments in on-the-job training.
His estimates of the return to schooling at the "overtaking point," (when
earnings are no longer depressed by investments) suggest a drop from 12%
in 1969 to 7% in 1973.

Finally, the marked decrease in the proportion of

new college graduates (see Freeman, 1976, 1977), in professional and
managerial jobs, where the profiles are traditionally the steepest, suggest
that it will be difficult for young college workers to 'catch up' significantly
in the future.

Overall, while some catch up is likely, it appears more

likely on the basis of current information that the large youth

coho~ts

of the 1970s will suffer some loss in earnings compared to the smaller
cohorts that preceeded them and to the smaller cohorts that will enter
the job market in the 1980s.
Developments in the 1980s should provide, at the least, an interesting
'test' of alternative interpretations of the determinants of changes in

34

male age'-earnings profiles.

If relative wages by age shift in favor of

young workers when the -number of young workers declines in the mid to late
19BO~,

thp. imoortance of demographic factors as determinants of

male age-earnings profiles will be given further support.

If the large

youth cohorts of the 1970s do not experience especially rapid longitudinal
gains in earnings in the eighties, the incompleteness of the standard
interpretation of cross-section profiles in terms of investments
in training will be further demonstrated.

Opposite patterns will, of

course, have contrary implications.
Finally, while the importance of demographic and demand factors
relative to investments in human capital as determinants of age-earnings
profiles remains to be seen, the experience of the 1970s and earlier
analyzed in this study does suggest that greater consideration be given
to demand for labor by age in analyzing male age-earnings profiles.

Unfortunately, there is no way to deal directly with the problem of changes
in imputation procedures between the 1969 and 1973 March CPS tapes.
Prior to 1976 the public use tapes do not contain "flags" for imputed
earnings, making comparable regressions impossible.

As the new imputation

procedure appears to have greatly affected the earnings of workers by
education but not by age, however, the results are unlikely to be seriously
marred by this problem.

Regressions with the March 1975 tape (which used

the old imputation procedure) give, in any case, results much like those
found with the March 1978 tape.

That report shows that age comparisons are only

modestly biased by the change in imputation procedure, but that education

There is a marked jump in the relative

l4While the regression calculations "explain" the bulk of the variation in the
income of older men relative to the income of younger men, it is important
to recognize that some observations do not appear to fit the model.

In

particular, despite a relatively large number of younger workers in the
late 1940s/early 1950s, the age-income profile was not as steeply sloped
as the analysis would lead one to expect.

This may be the result of the

effect of the Great Depression and World War II on the employment experiences
of workers or the result of the reduction in female participation at the end
of the war.

What is needed is a detailed study of the labor market for

younger and older workers in that period to determine why relatively large
numbers of young workers were 'absorbed' into the work force with little
reduction in the earnings of young workers relative to older workers.

with no other income was $4101.

These figures are similar to those in other years.

different time period, Joseph Anderson also has found that a large fraction
of the change in the relative wages of the young is due to their
numbers.

increas~d

However, he also attributes a large portion of the change to

greater complementarity between capital and middle aged (25-54 year old)
workers than between capital and younger workers, those aged 14-24.

While

both Anderson's results and those in this study show a depressant effect of
the increased relative humber on the wages of workers, they differ in the
estimated effect of capital, which may highlight the problems of measuring
that variable.

Differences in the age groups covered may also explain

the moderately different results obtained between Anderson's data set
and the one used here.
