The Insensitivity of Consumption to News About Income

ABSTRACT

This paper uses a variance bounds test to see whether consumption is
too sensitive to news about income to be consistent with a standard permanent
income model, under the maintained hypothesis that income has a unit root.
It
is found that, if anything, consumption is less sensitive than the model would
predict. This implication is robust to the representative consumer having
private information about his future income that the econometrjcjan does not
have, to wealth shocks, and to transitory consumption. This suggests the
importance in future research on the model of allowing for factors that tend
to make consumption smooth.

L Introduction
A standard rational expectations version of the permanent income model of
consumption implies that the unanticipated component of

consumption equals the

unanticipated change in the expected present discounted value of labor income

(Flavin (1981)). Flavin's (1981) and Kotlikoff and Pakes's (1984) tests,
however, indicated that post World War II aggregate U.S. consumption responds
too strongly to news about income for this model to be correct. Flavin (1981),

for example, found that the consumption response to an income innovation was
over three times the value predicted by the model.
Flavin (1981) and Kotljkoff and Pakes (1984) accounted for the observed

upward movement in per capita income by detrending their income series. Mankiw
and Shapiro (1985) have pointed out that if income has a unit root with drift
rather than a time trend, then the use of time trends in empirical tests will

tend to spuriously suggest excess sensitivity of consumption to income.
Mankiw and Shapiro left open the question of whether or not consumption is

excessively sensitive, if in fact income has unit root. Deaton (1986) has
argued that if such is the case, there is some evidence that consumption is in
fact less sensitive to news about income than the model predicts--precisely the
opposite conclusion that is reached when detrending is used.

This paper uses a variance bounds test to consider in detail the issue of
the sensitivity of consumption to news about income, largely under the
maintained hypothesis that the income process has a unit root. In section 2, I
develop the implications of the model for the relationship between the relevant

consumption and Income variances. All of the papers cited in the previous
paragraphs assumed that the representative consumer uses only lagged income to
forecast future income, and exploited the resulting prediction that the

2

unanticipated consumption component is equal to a certain function of the

innovation in the univariate income process. This implication will not hold,
however, if the representative consumer uses additional data, such as say, tax
or labor market variables, to forecast his income.

In this case, the variance

of the relevant consumption component will be less than the variance of this

function of the univariate innovation. One can, however, use just consumption
and income data to calculate precisely how much less variable consumption
should be, and thus determine whether consumption is in fact too smooth.
In section 3, the paper uses some post World War II quarterly data to test
both the inequality and equality derived in section 2, under the assumption

that income has a unit root. As in the estimates reported in Deaton (1986), it
is

found that the relevant consumption variance is indeed less than the

relevant income variance. The evidence does not strongly suggest, however,

that

this implied insensitivity of consumption results from additional

information used by the consumer to forecast income. In various ARIMA
specifications for the univariate income process, the point estimate of how
much less variable consumption should be, given the consumer's superior
information, is never more than a third, and is usually less than a tenth, of

the point estimate of the difference in the variances. Neither wealth shocks
nor white noise transitory consumption help explain the residual difference.
The difference is significantly different from zero at the 5 per cent level in
almost all specifications.

This means that allowing for a unit root in the income process implies
that the aggregate data are not quite as inconsistent with the permanent income
model as is suggested when one allows instead for a time trend (Plavin (1981)).
On the other hand, the model by no means comfortably characterizes the data.

3

It would seem that if one accepts the unit root

specification, consumption is

even smoother than the model predicts.
A final introductory word is appropriate, on why variance tests are useful

in studying the permanent income model. An alternative would be to test the
cross-equation restrictions of the model. Hansen and Sargent (1981) have
pointed out that the cross-equation restrictions of a linear rational

expectations model summarize all the restrictions of the model. So if these
are obeyed, so, too, are any variance inequalities implied by the model.

Indeed, one can show that unpredictability of changes in

consumption implies

the variance inequality studied here.

The additional power of the tests of cross-equation restrictions does not,
however, seem to be of critical importance in studying the permanent income

model. Tests of the model have tended to suggest that whether or not one
detrends, the model can be rejected by formal statistical tests (e.g., Blinder
and Deaton (1986), Campbell (1985), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Marshall (1987),
Flavin (1981), Hall (1978), Nelson (1985), Watson (1986)).

It is natural,

then, to ask what stylized facts about consumption appear to be inconsistent

with the model. In this connection, a variance test can be very revealing. It
suggests that if income has a unit root, there is not much appeal to the
argument that consumption is excessively sensitive to news about income.
Rather, in future research that maintains the assumption of a unit root, it is
important to allow for factors that tend to make consumption even smoother than
the permanent income model predicts.

2. The Model and Test

The model is as in Flavin (1981). It is assumed that consumption equals

4

permanent income, with permanent income the infinite horizon annuity value of
the sum of human and nonhuman wealth:

Flavin (1981) showed that the model implies that the change in consumption
equals the unpredictable change in the annuity value of labor income:

results

7

The Blinder and Deaton (1986) data were used, and were kindly supplied by

Angus Deaton. The data were real (1972 dollars), seasonally adjusted, and per
capita, 1953:2 to 1984:4. The consumption data were for nondurables and
services, excluding shoes and clothing. These data were divided by .7855,

the

mean fraction of such consumption in total consumption over this period, before
any statistics were calculated.

Blinder and Deaton constructed separate series for labor income and
disposable income. I measured rw1, income from nonhuman wealth, in two ways.
The first followed Campbell (1985) and set rw to the difference between the

two income series. The second set w to the MPS series for household net
worth, converted to real (1972) per capita dollars, and then calculated the

A

quarterly real interest rate of .5 per cent was assumed throughout the results

reported below. Point estimates (though not standard errors) were also
calculated for quarterly interest rates of .25, .75, 1.0 and 1.25 per cent.
These are not reported, since the results were very similar, but are available
on request.

As just noted, the test of the inequality and equality variance relations
requires estimates of the parameters of the univariate

done assuming that Ay follows an ARMA(p,q) process, with

process. This was
This wide

variety of processes was used to make sure that the results were not sensitive

to the exact specification chosen. The ARMA parameters were estimated by
nonlinear least squares, with the presample disturbances set to zero. The
Monte Carlo evidence in Ansley and Newbold (1980) suggests that this technique
has attractive small sample properties when roots are not near the unit circle,

8

as appears to be the case in these data. All variances were calculated with
the appropriate degrees of freedom adjustment.

The estimated parameter vector included not only the autoregressive

coefficients, but all the variances that needed to be computed. The covariance
matrix of the estimated vector was calculated using the methods of Newey and

West (1987). The technique properly accounts for the uncertainty about all the
elements of the parameter vector, and allows, for example, arbitrary serial

correlation of the difference between c-rw and tH' and for arbitrary
heteroskedasticity of the disturbances conditional on past values of Ay.4 A
tenth order Newey and West (1987) correction was used because the asymptotic
theory requires that the order of the correction be the square root of the

sample size, which was about 120. A small amount of experimentation with fifth
and fifteenth order corrections indicated that the calculated standard errors
are not sensitive to the order of the correction.

Table 1 contains the estimates of the univariate Ay process. Application
of Box-Jenkins techniques would probably suggest an AR(l), or, perhaps an
MA(l): neither

nor e2 are significantly different from zero at the five

percent level in any specification. Except for (p,q)(0,0) (which is the only
specification that has a Q statistic significantly different from zero), the
implied values of 4i are very similar. They range from about 1.4 to about 1.9.

Table 2 contains the results on the tests of the innovation variances. As
may be seen in column (4), the null hypothesis that a-ci is zero can be
comfortably rejected at the 5 per cent level for all specifications. The
permanent income model does not fare as well when one tests instead the null
that

and (p,q)=(2,2), where the

In sum, then, column 4 suggests that a2 is less than a, which is what the

permanent income model predicts. Unfortunately, it appears from columns 6 and
8 that the implied insensitivity of consumption to news about income is
unlikely to result purely from the use by the consumer of additional variables
to forecast income.

The remainder of this section briefly considers two minor modifications to

the model (l)-(3), and four technical modifications to the procedure used.
None of these appear likely to explain the insensitivity. The modifications to
the model:

(l)Wealth shocks. Let us modify the budget constraint (3) to allow for shocks
to wealth, say, unanticipated capital gains (Campbell

(1985)): w (l+r)wt_i +

÷ a, where a is a white noise random variable. This implies that
equation (4) becomes Ac =

yti-EytiIIt_i

+ rae. If the wealth shock a is

negatively correlated with the innovation in the present value of labor income,

then var(Ac) will be less than a. Such a shock therefore potentially
explains the results in Table 1.

To accomodate this possibility, subtract

consumption, where transitory consumption is a zero mean stationary variable.
If transitory consumption is uncorrelated with any of the variables used to

forecast income, then var(Ac) =

+ var(linearly filtered transitory

consumption) (see Flavin (1981) for the exact formula when transitory

consumption is white noise) and so var(Ac) is bigger than

var(c-rw-yH) =

var(yI-yH)

.

Also,

+ var(transitory consumption) is larger than

{r2[l-(1+r)2]}'O. As noted in Deaton (1986), then, such transitory
consumption cannot explain excess smoothness of consumption. The same applies
to transitory consumption positively correlated with news about income (say,
5
because of within quarter multiplier effects).

The four technical modifications to the procedure used:

(l)Monte Carlo estimates of significance levels. It is possible that there is
a strong finite sample bias towards rejection, even when the model is true. To
investigate this possibility, a small Monte Carlo experiment was performed.
For ARNA (1,0) and ARNA (0,1) processes, the permanent income model was used to
generate one hundred artificial samples of consumption and income data of size
6
125 were generated. The ARNA parameters matched those reported in Table 1.

beginning of this section, and the estimated

consumer having additional variables to forecast income, when in fact the
entire difference is so explained.

The results are in Table 3. To read the table, consider the entries in
line 1. The column 2 entry is .091 = 161.6/1782.1 =
(Table 2, line 2, column
5)/(Table 2, line 2, column 4). Now, 100 samples were generated with the true
(population) value of

= 161.6.

The column 3 entry of

.02 indicates that in only 2 of these 100 was the estimated

(Table 2, line 2, column 7)/(Table 2, line 2, column 4). The

H c

The significance levels in columns 3 and 5 of Table 3 are consistent with
those implied by columns 6 and 8 in Table 1.

In particular, the Monte Carlo

experiment suggests that the odds are less than .05 that the results for the
ARMA(1,O) and ARHA (0,1) specifications are purely due to sampling error,

rather than to a shortcoming of the model. Since only 100 samples were used to
establish the Monte Carlo significance levels, this experiment does not
establish the small sample distribution of the Table 2 estimates with any great

degree of precision. But the experiment also does not suggest that there is a
systematic bias towards rejection of the model.

(2)Estimates for subsamples. Point estimates (though not standard errors) of
all the entries in Table 2 were calculated for samples ending in 1973:3 and

12

beginning in 1974:1. This was done to guard against the possibility that the
first OPEC shock caused an unexpected shift in the stochastic process for c

and

thereby biasing the estimates in an unpredictable way. In each of the

unlikely to explain the Table 2 results.

(3)Nonparametric estimates of 4.

In

a different context, Cochrane (1986) has

argued that the use of low order ARMA models can cause large errors in

estimation of quantities like 4.

Angus Deaton has pointed out to me that 4

can be approximated by the frequency domain quantity that Cochrane (1986)
suggested for a different purpose.

by [d(l)]2a, which may be a reasonable

approximation since r is very small. If Ay is AR(1) with first order serial
correlation coefficient of .44 (the estimate in these data), for example,

[d(l)]2 =

3.19, td[(l+r)']}2 = 3.16 when r.005.7

Now, [d(l)]2a is just the spectral density of Ay at frequency zero.
Thus we can use the spectral density to approximate td[(l+r)']12, without

parametrically specifying the A process. It should be noted that this
approximation is applicable even if y is stationary around a time trend. It
is also applicable if y is a mixture of stationary and unit root processes, as
in Watson (1986).

13

I estimated this using what Anderson (1971, p512) calls a modified

Bartlett estimator. This estimator is simply a weighted sum of the sample
autocovariances of Aye. (Recall that

spectral density evaluated at

frequency zero is simply the sum of its autocovariances.) I tried

Using the asymptotic normal approximation to the

finite sample distribution (Anderson, 1971, p540), a 95 percent confidence
interval for this estimate is about (857, 16582).

Unsurprisingly, the

nonparainetric estimate is somewhat noisier than are the parametric ones. The

values of most of the point estimates of

in Table 1, are nonetheless

outside this confidence interval.8
(4)Using data from every fourth quarter, rather than every quarter. This

obviously will reduce any biases induced by seasonal adjustment. it also may
reduce any biases from moving average components due to time aggregation: if
instantaneous consumption is a continuous time random walk, it is well known

that measured cc1 is MACi) with a coefficient of 1/4 (Christiano and
Eichenbaum (1986)); it is straightforward to verify that in such a case,

measured cc4 is MA(1) with a coefficient of 1/22.

The variances were calculated for each quarter in four separate tests. (A
more powerful test would of course result from pooling the four sets of

estimates, and performing a joint test. This, however, seemed pointless, in
light of the result.) Thirty observations were available for the first quarter

significance of the rejections is quite strong, though with only 30 or 31
observations the asymptotic normal approximation perhaps should not be taken
very seriously.

4. Conclusions

The variance bounds test applied here suggests that consumption is even
less sensitive to news about income than the permanent income model predicts.
The test maintained the assumption that income has a unit root (although there
was one nonparametric estimate that is valid even if income is

stationary

around a time trend). If, then, income does have a unit root, as is argued in

Mankiw and

Shapiro

(1985) and

Deaton

(1986), a stylized fact is that

consumption is insensitive to news about income. This does not suggest (to me)
liquidity constraints, as is considered in, for example, Flavin (1985).
Extensions of the model that seem more likely to be consistent with consumption
insensitivity include nonseparability of preferences, so that consumption
expenditures in a given period yield utility in future periods (e.g.,

Eichenbaum, Hansen and
Bernanke (1985)) and

Singleton

habit

(1986)), costs of adjusting consumption (e.g.,

persistence (e.g., Deaton (1986)).

Footnotes
1. Mankiw and Shapiro (1985) conclude this in the sense that one will tend to
spuriously find that lagged income helps predict changes in consumption.

It

follows from the sign of the biases reported in Table 2 in Mankiw and Shapiro
(1985), and from the algebra in Flavin (1981, p993), however, that one will
also tend to spuriously find excess sensitivity of changes in consumption to
the income innovation.

2. One key technical condition used in West (1987) is worth noting. This is
that arithmetic differences suffice to induce stationarity in all the

variables in I. This is consistent with most of the permanent income
literature. Exceptions are Nelson (1985) and Watson (1986), who assume that

log differences are required. Incidentally, if I. contains variables in
addition to lagged y, the variance-covariance matrix of the consumption and
income innovations will not be singular, a problem noted in Hall (1986).

say that HI depends on r in any simple way, since trtH potentially
varies with r in a complicated manner.

4. The (p+q+1) past values of Ay that are used as instruments in nonlinear

least squares are ae/m, ae/a#1, ... ,

ae/e1, ...,

ae/3e.

Heteroskedasticity of e conditional on these past values of Ayt was accounted
for.

5. Another extension to the model deserves mention, namely, allowing for

variations in expected returns. While this is a possible avenue for future
research on consumption variability, this is not pursued here. The basic

reason is that consumption models that allow for such variations still find

evidence against the model (e.g., Grossman and Shiller (1981)). This suggests
that simply generalizing the model to allow for this variation will not
reconcile the consumption and income data, especially since Michener (1984)
has argued that in general equilibrium, this variation will make consumption
more sensitive to income than the permanent income model predicts.
6. Specifically, for the AR(l) process (the MACi) simulation was analogous):

write the Ay process as Ay. =

where

+

+ e.

=

It was assumed that

e=z+x60, with x and z mutually and serially

uncorre].ated zero mean normal random variables. It is routine to use the
formulas in Hansen and Sargent (1980) to calculate y1]. The values of i and
1

were chosen to match those estimated in the data, those of

that

z

and

x

so

and c,, i1 or 2, would match those estimated in the data and

reported in Table 2. A different random number seed was used to initiate the

generation of the z id x for each of the four different specifications in
Table 3.

7. Even though [d(i)J2 >

[d[(1+r1fl2

in this example, there is no

presumption of an upward bias in general.

8. The 95 percent confidence interval is not valid if the true value of the
spectral density is zero, as would be the case if

time trend. The interval is valid, however, if

is stationary around a
is a mixture of trend

stationary and unit root components, as in Watson (1986).

of an explicit continuous time consumption model.

I. Description of Data
The consumption and income data are described in Blinder and Deaton

(1986). They are real, seasonally adjusted, and per capita, expressed at
annual rates. Consumption is NIA (national income and product accounts)
nondurables and services, with (i)clothing and shoes removed, and (ii)state and
local nontax payments (e.g., tuition payments to state colleges) added in.
Disposable income is NIA disposable income, with (i)interest payments from

consumers to business netted out, (ii)state and local notax payments added in,
and (iii)the 1975:2 tax rebate removed.
The MPS series for nominal net worth of households comes from unpublished
quarterly flow of funds data, except that the flow of funds estimate of

household holdings of stock is replaced by an MPS estimate. The corresponding
annual flow of funds figures may be found in, e.g., pp 11-15 of Federal Reserve
Board publication G.9 (October 1986) "Balance Sheets of the U.S. Economy, 1946-

85." The series includes tangible and financial assets and liabilities. All
fixed income assets and liabilities are measured at par. Blinder and Deaton
created a real, per capita series for household wealth by first converting
household holdings of government debt from par to market, and then deflating
with the price level appropriate for their measure of nondurables and
consumption.

I multiplied this series by four so that the MPS measure of

income from nonhuman wealth would be expressed at an annual rate.

Hayashi

("The Permanent Income Hypothesis: Estimation and Testing by Instrumental

Variables," , 1982, 895-916) points out that under the Ricardian assumption
that consumers expect future tax liabilities to be required to service
government debt, a nonhuman wealth series should include government debt;
otherwise, one would have to adjust the labor income series for the decrease in

human

wealth

that occurs when such debt is issued.
