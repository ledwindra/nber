JEL No. C1,C32
ABSTRACT
There is a fast growing literature that partially identifies structural vector autoregressions (SVARs)
by imposing sign restrictions on the responses of a subset of the endogenous variables to a particular
structural shock (sign-restricted SVARs). To date, the methods that have been used are only justified
from a Bayesian perspective. This paper develops methods of constructing error bands for impulse
response functions of sign-restricted SVARs that are valid from a frequentist perspective. We also
provide a comparison of frequentist and Bayesian error bands in the context of an empirical application
- the former can be twice as wide as the latter.

Introduction

During the three decades following Sims’s (1980) “Macroeconomics and Reality,” structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) have become an important tool in empirical macroeconomics. They
have been used for macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis, as well as to investigate the
sources of business cycle fluctuations and to provide a benchmark against which modern dynamic
macroeconomic theories can be evaluated. The most controversial step in the specification of a
structural VAR is the mapping between reduced form one-step-ahead forecast errors and orthogonalized, interpretable, structural innovations. Most SVARs in the literature have been constructed
by sufficiently imposing many restrictions such that the relationship between structural innovations
and forecast errors is one-to-one. However, in the past decade, starting with Faust (1998), Canova
and De Nicolo (2002), and Uhlig (2005), empirical researchers have used more agnostic approaches
that generate bounds on structural impulse response functions by restricting the sign of certain
responses. We will refer to this class of models as sign-restricted SVARs. They have been employed, for instance, to measure the effects of monetary policy shocks (Faust, 1998; Canova and
De Nicolo, 2002; Uhlig, 2005), technology shocks (Dedola and Neri, 2007; Peersman and Straub,
2009), government spending shocks (Mountford and Uhlig, 2008; Pappa, 2009), and oil price shocks
(Baumeister and Peersman, 2008; Kilian and Murphy, 2009).
Empirical findings about the dynamic effects of structural economic shocks are typically reported in terms of (point) estimates of impulse response functions, surrounded by error bands. If
the autoregressive system is stationary and the SVAR is sufficiently restricted such that the impulse
response functions are point identified, then the reported error bands are typically interpretable
from both a frequentist as well as a Bayesian perspective. In large samples they delimit approximately valid frequentist confidence intervals and Bayesian credible sets. Since impulse responses in
sign-restricted SVARs can only be bounded, they belong to the class of set-identified or partially
identified econometric models, using the terminology of Manski (2003). As shown in detail in Moon
and Schorfheide (2009), the large-sample numerical equivalence of frequentist confidence sets and
Bayesian credible sets breaks down in set-identified models. In particular, frequentist confidence
sets tend to be substantially larger. The error bands for sign-restricted SVARs that have been
reported in the literature thus far are only meaningful from a Bayesian perspective and cannot be
interpreted as frequentist confidence intervals.
The main goal of the paper is to provide methods of constructing error bands that delimit valid

2
frequentist confidence intervals.1 In this regard, the paper makes several specific contributions.
First, we demonstrate how to formulate the frequentist inference problem for impulse responses
of sign-restricted SVARs as a minimum distance problem. Second, we provide a general characterization of the identified sets associated with impulse responses as well as an efficient way of
computing them. For the case of scalar point-wise responses, we show that the identified set is a
bounded interval. Third, building on recent work in microeconometrics by Chernozhukov, Hong,
and Tamer (2007, henceforth CHT), Rosen (2008), Andrews and Guggenberger (2009), and Andrews and Soares (2010a), we propose three different methods to obtain frequentist error bands.
We prove that all three methods generate asymptotically valid confidence sets. They differ with
respect to conservativeness and computational burden - the most conservative error bands are the
fastest to compute. Fourth, in an empirical application we compare the proposed frequentist error
bands to Bayesian error bands for the effects of a monetary policy shock in a four-variable VAR.
In our application, the frequentist bands are up to twice as wide as the Bayesian bands, which is
consistent with the large sample results obtained in Moon and Schorfheide (2009).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a simple example of a
sign-restricted SVAR. We describe how set-identification arises in this model, discuss the commonly
used Bayesian inference in this model, outline our procedure to construct frequentist error bands,
and discuss more precisely in what dimension we modify and extend inference methods developed in
the microeconometric literature. Section 3 generalizes the setup and introduces additional notation.
In Section 4 we develop our frequentist inference procedures and provide three types of error bands
that differ with respect to conservativeness and computational burden. The section also provides
a detailed discussion of how to compute the error bands efficiently. To illustrate our methods, we
conduct a small Monte Carlo study in Section 5 and generate error bands for output, inflation,
interest rate, and money responses to a monetary policy shock in an empirical application in
Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes. Proofs for the two theorems stated in Section 4 are
presented in the appendix of this paper. Proofs of the lemmas that appear in the main text as
well as additional lemmas used in the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are relegated to a supplemental
Online Appendix. This Online Appendix also contains detailed derivations for the Monte Carlo
study presented in Section 5.

The contribution of this paper is meant to be positive. We do not criticize the use of Bayesian inference methods

as long as it is understood that their output needs to be interpreted from a Bayesian perspective. We provide applied
researchers who are interested in impulse response error bands that are valid from a frequentist perspective with
econometric tools to compute such error bands.

p

We use the following notation throughout the remainder of the paper: “−→” and “=⇒” denote
convergence in probability and distribution, respectively. “≡” signifies distributional equivalence.
I{x ≥ a} is the indicator function that is one if x ≥ a and zero otherwise. We use sgn(x)
to denote the sign of x and ∝ to indicate proportionality. 0n×m is a n × m matrix of zeros
and In is the n × n identity matrix. ⊗ is the Kronecker product, vec(·) stacks the columns of
a matrix, and tr[·] is the trace operator. We use diag(A1 , . . . , Ak ) to denote a quasi-diagonal
matrix with submatrices A1 , . . ., Ak on its diagonal and zeros elsewhere. If A is a n × m vector,
p
then kAkW = tr[W A0 A]. In the special case of a vector, our definition implies that kAkW =
√
A0 W A. If the weight matrix is the identity matrix, we omit the subscript. A p-variate normal
distribution is denoted by Np (µ, Σ). A p × q matrix X is matrix-variate normal M Np×q (M, Q ⊗ P )
if vec(X) ∼ Npq (vec(M ), Q ⊗ P ). A q × q matrix Σ has the Inverted Wishart IWq (S, ν) distribution

if p(Σ|S, ν) ∝ |Σ|−(ν+q+1)/2 exp − 12 tr[Σ−1 S] . If X|Σ ∼ M Np×q (M, Σ ⊗ P ) and Σ ∼ IWq (S, ν),
we say that (X, Σ) ∼ M N IW (M, P, S, ν). If there is no ambiguity about the dimension of the
random vectors and matrices, we drop the subscripts that signify dimensions. We use χ2m to denote
a χ2 distribution with m degrees of freedom.

A Simple Example

Consider a VAR in which the vector yt of endogenous variables is composed of inflation and output
growth. For simplicity, we shall assume that the VAR has lag order of zero, that is, yt = ut
where ut ∼ iidN (0, Σu ). Moreover, it is assumed that the one-step ahead forecast errors are linear
functions of “structural” demand and supply shocks, stacked in the vector t = [D,t , S,t ]0 . Let Σtr
be the lower triangular Cholesky factor of Σu with elements Σtr
ij and Ω an arbitrary orthogonal
matrix. Thus, yt = Σtr Ω t , where t ∼ iidN (0, I). The covariance matrix of yt is by construction
invariant to Ω . In order to restrict the set of admissible Ω ’s, one can impose the sign restrictions
that a demand shock moves prices and output in the same direction and the normalization that a
positive demand shock increases prices.
Without loss of generality, suppose that the first element of t is the structural demand shock
and the first column of Ω is given by the 2 × 1 vector q. The object of interest, θ, is the inflation
response. Using the notation
tr
tr 0
φ = [φ1 , φ2 , φ3 ]0 = [Σtr
11 , Σ21 , Σ22 ] ,

q = [q1 , q2 ]0 = [cos ϕ, sin ϕ]0 ,

4
one can express the inflation response to a demand shock and the sign restrictions on inflation and
output respectively as
θ = q1 φ1 ≥ 0,

q1 φ2 + q2 φ3 ≥ 0.

(1)

We shall refer to θ as structural parameter and φ as reduced form parameter. The latter is consistently estimable from the data. Since φ1 ≥ 0, we deduce that q1 = cos(ϕ) ≥ 0 and ϕ ∈ [−π/2, π/2].
The second inequality in (1) implies
q2 ≥ −

φ2
q1 .
φ3

(2)

For φ2 ≤ 0, this inequality is always satisfied. Using the unit length restriction on q, it can also
be verified that for φ2 < 0, the inequality (2) is satisfied whenever q12 ≤ φ23 /(φ22 + φ23 ). Thus,
conditional on φ, the structural parameter θ = q1 φ1 has to lie in the following set:
s



φ23
Θ(φ) = 0, φ1 max I{φ2 ≥ 0},
.
φ22 + φ23

(3)

Θ(φ) is called the identified set. Since this set is not a singleton, θ is only partially identified.
In applied work with sign-restricted structural VARs, researchers have used Bayesian inference
to obtain error bands for impulse response functions. Bayesian inference in this setting amounts
to specifying a joint prior distribution on (φ, q), which can be factorized as p(φ, q) = p(φ)p(q|φ).
Researchers typically use a prior that is uniform with respect to ϕ, which implies that q(ϕ) is
uniformly distributed on the hypersphere. This prior is then truncated to ensure that the sign
restrictions are satisfied. In the context of our example, we obtain
s

φ22 + φ23
For instance, if φ2 ≤ 0, then the change of variables θ = φ1 cos ϕ implies that
I {θ ∈ Θ(φ)}
.
p(θ|φ) ∝ p
1 − (θ/φ1 )2

(4)

Thus, due to the change of variables, θ is not uniformly distributed on the identified set. Since
θ conditional on φ does not enter the likelihood function, the posterior distribution of θ can be
expressed as the mixture
Z
p(θ|Y ) =

p(θ|φ)p(φ|Y )dφ,

(5)

where p(φ|Y ) is the posterior of the reduced form parameter. As the sample size increases, the
posterior distribution of φ concentrates around the maximum likelihood estimate φ̂ of the reduced

5
form parameter. Moon and Schorfheide (2009) show that posterior credible sets for θ can be approximated by prior credible sets obtained from p(θ|φ̂), which lie inside of the (estimated) identified
set Θ(φ̂).
The objective of this paper is to construct frequentist confidence sets for θ. The basic idea is
the following. Define the nonnegative function

Q(θ; φ, W ) =

W

where W is a positive-definite weight matrix. Based on (1) it is straightforward to verify that
θ ∈ Θ(φ) if and only if Q(θ; φ, W ) = 0. We now replace φ by the maximum likelihood estimator
φ̂ and W by a data-based weight matrix Ŵ . A confidence set can then be obtained as a level set
associated with the sample analog of Q(θ; φ, W ):


θ
CS = θ θ ≥ 0 and Q(θ; φ̂, Ŵ ) ≤ c ,

(7)

where c is a critical value that ensures that the confidence set has the desired coverage probability,
at least asymptotically, for every θ ∈ Θ(φ). Notice that for any critical value c > 0, the confidence
set has the property that Θ(φ̂) ⊂ CS θ . Thus, as explained in detail in Moon and Schorfheide
(2009), the frequentist confidence set will be asymptotically larger than the Bayesian credible set.
The computation of the confidence set essentially amounts to checking the inequality Q(θ; φ̂, Ŵ ) ≤ c
for values of θ on a suitably chosen grid.
The use of a point-wise testing procedure to construct confidence sets dates back to work by
Anderson and Rubin (1949) and is widely employed to implement identification-robust inference. It
has been used in the weak-instrument literature, e.g., Dufour (1997) and Staiger and Stock (1997),
and starting with CHT also in the literature on set-identified econometric models. While (6) resembles one of the popular objective functions used in the literature on moment inequality models, two
important differences exist. First, the data enter the objective function only through the reduced
form parameter estimator φ̂. In this regard, Q(θ; φ̂, Ŵ ) is similar to an objective function for a
minimum-distance estimator, and the starting point of our analysis will be an assumption about
the limit distribution of φ̂. Second, an important difference between Q(θ; φ̂, Ŵ ) and the objective
functions studied in the moment-inequality model literature, e.g., Rosen (2008) and Andrews and
Guggenberger (2009), is the presence of the nuisance parameter q(ϕ) in (6). We shall consider two
approaches to construct confidence sets: a profile objective function in which q(ϕ) is concentrated

6
out and a projection of a joint confidence set for θ and q on the domain of θ. We use insights
from Rosen (2008) to construct somewhat conservative critical values for a nuisance parameter-free
bound of the profile objective function. In the construction of joint (θ, q) confidence sets, we apply
Andrews and Soares’s (2010a) moment selection procedure. Using techniques developed in Andrews
and Guggenberger (2009) and Andrews and Soares (2010a), we prove that our confidence sets are
asymptotically valid in a uniform sense. The moment selection procedure yields less conservative
error bands but is computationally more involved. Our paper provides empirical researchers with
a menu of choices in regard to computational burden and conservativeness.

General Setup and Notation

Suppose the evolution of the n × 1 vector yt is described by a p’th order difference equation of the
form
yt = Φ1 yt−1 + . . . + Φp yt−p + ut ,

E[ut |Ft−1 ] = 0,

E[ut u0t |Ft−1 ] = Σu ,

(8)

where the information set Ft−1 = {yt−1 , yt−2 , . . .} is composed of the lags of yt ’s. Deterministic
trend terms are omitted because they are irrelevant for the subsequent discussion. (8) is a reduced
form representation of the VAR because the ut ’s are simply one-step-ahead forecast errors and do
not have a specific economic interpretation. As in Section 2, it is assumed that the one-step-ahead
forecast errors are functions of a vector of fundamental innovations t , for instance, composed of
innovations in aggregate technology, preferences, or monetary policy:
ut = Φ t = Σtr Ω t ,

E[t |Ft−1 ] = 0,

E[t 0t |Ft−1 ] = I,

(9)

where Σtr is the lower triangular Cholesky factor of Σu and Ω is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix.
Assuming that the lag polynomial associated with the VAR in (8) is invertible, one can express yt
as the following infinite-order vector moving average (VMA) process:
yt =

Ch ut−h =

h=0

(10)

j=0

where vt is a n × 1 vector of standard normal variates. The matrices of the moving average
representation can be interpreted as impulse responses to the orthogonolized innovations vt :
Rhv = IE[yt+h |vt = I, Ft ] − IE[yt+h |Ft ] =

∂yt+h
= Ch Σtr ,
∂vt0

h = 0, . . . , H − 1.

(11)

7
The goal is to construct a confidence set for a k̃ × 1 vector θ of impulse responses to a structural
shock. Since such confidence sets are often presented as pointwise error bands, the case of k̃ = 1 is
of particular importance. Partial identification is achieved by restricting the signs of the responses
of a subset of the endogenous variables at particular horizons. Let H denote the set that collects
v that stacks
the impulse response horizons h = 0, . . . , H − 1 and define the nH × n matrix RH

the matrices Rhv for h ∈ H. The responses to the orthogonolized shocks vt can be converted into
responses to structural shocks t as follows:

v
RH
= RH
Ω .

(12)

Rather than examining responses to the full vector of structural shocks, t , we will focus on responses
to one particular shock. Without loss of generality, we assume that the shock of interest is 1,t and
will denote the first column of Ω by the n × 1 unit length vector q ∈ Q.
Let S̃θ be a k̃ × nH matrix that selects and potentially transforms the structural impulse
v q into the object of interest, θ:

Low-level conditions for identification of structural VARs can be found in Rubio-Ramirez,
Waggoner, and Zha (2010). The identified set Θ(φ) is defined as the set of impulse responses θ that
are consistent with a particular φ. A general characterization of the identified set can be obtained
as follows. Define the nonnegative function Q(θ; φ, W )
Q(θ; φ, W ) =

where W is a positive-definite matrix and µ regulates the slackness of the inequalities from the sign
restrictions on the responses not included in θ. It is straightforward to verify that
θ ∈ Θ(φ)

if and only if Q(θ; φ, W ) = 0

and

Mθ θ ≥ 0.

(19)

The following lemma states that for k̃ = 1 the identified set Θ(φ) is a bounded interval.
Lemma 1 Suppose Assumption 1 is satisfied and k̃ = 1. Then Θ(φ) is convex and bounded.
Lemma 1 is comforting from a practitioner’s perspective. Despite the lack of point-identification,
it is guaranteed that the response of the endogenous variables yt to a one-standard deviation
structural shock is bounded. Moreover, the lemma guarantees that scalar responses in this model
can be characterized by two numbers: the lower bound and the upper bound of the identified
interval.

Frequentist Inference

Inference for θ is conducted in two steps. First, an estimator φ̂ of a vector of reduced form
parameters is constructed. Second, we conduct inference on θ conditional on the estimator φ̂ using
a sample analog of the objective function Q(θ; φ, W ) in (18). Since empirical researchers typically
depict error bands for impulse response functions that delimit point-wise credible or confidence
intervals, in most applications θ is a scalar, that is k = 1, representing the response of variable
i ∈ {1, . . . , n} to a shock j ∈ {1, . . . , n} at horizon h.
Rather than placing low-level restrictions on the VAR coefficient matrices Φ and Σ, as well as
the distribution of the reduced-form innovations ut , and deriving the distribution of φ̂, we directly
assume that φ̂ has a Gaussian limit distribution. It is noteworthy that this assumption requires
that all roots of the characteristic polynomial associated with the difference equation (8) lie outside
of the unit circle. Hence, we are ruling out the presence of unit roots and are implicitly assuming
that yt is trend stationary.
p

Assumption 2 (i) There exists an estimator φ̂ of the m × 1 vector φ such that φ̂ −→ φ and
√
T (φ̂ − φ) =⇒ N (0, Λ(φ)) uniformly for φ ∈ P. (ii) The matrix Λ(φ) is positive definite and there
exists a full-rank matrix Λmin such that Λ(φ) ≥ Λmin for all φ ∈ P. (iii) There exists an estimator
p

Λ̂ −→ Λ(φ) uniformly for φ ∈ P.
For notational simplicity, the dependence of Λ on φ is suppressed, unless this dependence plays
a crucial role. The assumption that Λ is full rank does not impose serious constraints on the
applicability of our analysis. Recall that we previously eliminated the n(n − 1)/2 zero elements of
the lower triangular matrix R0v by appropriately defining φ. Furthermore, in practice it is possible
to delete all elements of φ that are associated with columns of zeros in the matrix S̃(q). These are
elements that do not enter the construction of the structural responses that appear in θ or that are
sign restricted.2
2

Consider a 4-variable VAR(4) and suppose that the responses of 3 of the 4 variables are restricted upon impact

and for the subsequent 3 periods. Moreover, the object of interest is the response of the fourth variable at horizon
h = 9. Following the definitions in Section 3, the dimension of m = 10 · 42 − 6 = 154, whereas the number of reduced
form VAR coefficients is 4 · 16 + 10 = 74, which suggests that – abstracting from the effect of nonlinearities – the
covariance matrix Λ is rank deficient. However, in order to construct the sign-restricted responses as well as θ, one
can easily reduce the dimension of φ to 4 · 3 · 4 + 4 = 52 and obtain a nonsingular covariance matrix Λ.

10
Three methods of constructing confidence sets for θ are considered subsequently. All of the
methods have to deal with the unit-length nuisance parameter q. The first method (Section 4.2)
concentrates out q from the objective function that is used to construct the confidence interval. The
other two methods (Section 4.3) are based on a projection of a joint confidence interval for θ and
q. Section 4.4 provides computational details and step-by-step guidance for the implementation.
Finally, we discuss some extensions and limitations in Section 4.5. However, before we can proceed,
we need to state an assumption about the matrix S̃(q) = [S̃θ (q)0 , S̃R (q)0 ]0 .

4.1

An Assumption About S̃(q)

∗ (q) was useful to state our assumption about set identification (Assumption 1), the most
While S̃R

important object for the subsequent development of inference methods for θ is the matrix-valued
function S̃(q). Although this function is continuous in q, its row rank tends to be discontinuous.
√
Since we will use a weight function W that is based on the inverse covariance matrix of T S̃(q)(φ̂−
φ) to construct the objective function Q(θ; φ̂, W ), we have to invert the matrix S̃(q)ΛS̃ 0 (q) and need
to pay special attention to the potential rank reduction. To fix ideas, recall the example of Section 2,
which leads to

The first row of S̃(q) becomes zero if q = [q1 , q2 ]0 = [0, 1]. The singularity arises because Sφ
eliminates the second column of the matrix (I ⊗ q 0 ), which for q1 = 0 contains the only nonzero
entry in the first row of S̃(q).
We will now state an assumption to guarantee that row rank reductions of S̃(q) only arise from
rows of zeros. The assumption states that S̃(q) can be obtained from a matrix S̄(q) through a
series of transformations. The starting point is the matrix
S̄(q) = (InH ⊗ q 0 )Sφ .

(20)

Equation (16) and the definition of Sφ imply that S̄(q)φ generates the structural impulse responses
of the n variables for horizons h = 0, . . . , H − 1. Now consider the following five transformations
of S̄(q):

5. M S,5 : Deletion of columns of zeros.
The first transformation switches signs of impulse responses, e.g., to turn a nonnegativity
constraint into a nonpositivity constraint. The second transformation can be used to generate
cumulative impulse responses, e.g., convert responses of inflation rates into responses of the loglevel of inflation, or to transform impulse responses, e.g., turn responses of log nominal output and
log prices into responses of real output. The second transformation can also be used to constrain
(backward) differences of impulse responses in order to, say, impose monotonicity restrictions. The
third transformation reorders the impulse responses, e.g., to ensure that those responses that enter
the vector θ appear first. The fourth transformation can be used to eliminate those responses
that are neither the object of interest, i.e., contained in θ, nor sign restricted. Finally, the last
transformation can be used to reduce the dimension of φ by eliminating unused reduced form
impulse responses as discussed above.3 Notice that the identity matrix is a special case of all five
transformations. In turn, we can state our assumption about S̃(q).
Assumption 3 The matrix S̃(q) = [S̃θ (q)0 , S̃R (q)0 ]0 can be expressed as
!

Y
S̃(q) =
M S,k S̄(q)M S,5 .

In order to economize on the notation, we do not distinguish between the original vector φ introduced in (16)

and the vector that obtains by removing the elements that correspond to the columns of S̄(q) that get eliminated by
M S,5 .

12
By construction, the rows of S̄(q) are orthogonal. Since q lies on the unit-hypersphere, we can
deduce that a rank reduction of S̄(q) can only occur if one or more of the first n − 1 rows of S̄(q)
are zero. These rows contain elements of the form q1 , [q1 , q2 ]0 , . . ., [q1 , . . . , qn−1 ]0 . One can verify
that the transformations M S,k , k = 1, . . . , 5 preserve the property that rank reductions are due to
rows of zeros, which lead to the following lemma.
Lemma 2 Suppose Assumption 3 is satisfied. Then for a particular value of q, a row rank reduction
of S̃(q) arises only through one or more rows of zeros.
In order to eliminate the rows of zeros in S̃(q), we introduce the selection matrices V (q), Vθ (q),
and VR (q) to define the matrices
S(q) = V (q)S̃(q), Sθ (q) = Vθ (q)S̃θ (q), SR (q) = VR (q)S̃R (q).

(21)

The row dimensions of the three matrices are l(q), k(q), and r2 (q), respectively. By construction,
the three matrices have full row rank.

there exists a q̃ and µ̃ such that S̃θ (q̃)φ = θ and S̃R (q̃)φ = µ̃. Using the definition in (21), replace

conforming partitions of Σ(q̃) by Σij (q̃) = Si (q̃)ΛSj0 (q̃). Moreover, factorize Λ = LL0 and let ν2 be
the last element of the vector Mν ν. Then, omitting the q̃ argument, we obtain

is the diagonal matrix of standard deviations

associated with the covariance matrix Σii . Since ζ̂ converges in distribution to an m × 1 vector of

convergence of ζ̂ 0 PA1 ζ̂ to a χ2k̃+r̃

. The solution to the minimization problem is

ν̂2 = I{A02 (I − PA1 )ζ̂ ≥ 0}A02 (I − PA1 )ζ̂,
which generates the term I{Z ≤ 0}Z 2 in the limit distribution. Since PA1 ζ̂ and A02 (I − PA1 )ζ̂
are asympotically uncorrelated, Z is independent of the χ2 term in the characterization of the
asymptotic distribution.
Alternatively, if l(q̃) < k̃ + r̃2 , there is no need to partition S(q̃). By setting ν = 0, one obtains:

Since in this case l(q̃) ≤ k̃ + r̃2 − 1, the critical value associated with (29) remains valid, though
it is conservative. The limit distribution in (29) arises commonly in multivariate generalizations of
one-sided hypothesis problems, e.g., Perlman (1969), and its quantiles are used by Rosen (2008)
to construct contour confidence sets for moment inequality models. (26) provides a convenient
characterization of the critical value associated with this limit distribution.

Projection Approach with Moment Selection

consider a projection-based confidence set obtained from an objective function that does not concentrate out q. Let

Lemma 3 implies that the projection-based confidence set is potentially smaller than the confidence set constructed from the profile objective function. However, the disadvantage of the
projection-based approach is that the calculation of q-dependent critical values might require cumbersome simulations. We will discuss this trade-off in the context of the empirical application. If

one defines ϑ = [θ0 , q], then the objective function G θ, q; φ̂, Ŵ ∗ (·) has the same structure as the
objective functions considered in the literature on moment inequality models, e.g., CHT, Rosen
(2008), Andrews and Guggenberger (2009), and Andrews and Soares (2010a). The three main differences in the VAR application are that q is a nuisance parameter, that the objective function G(·)
corresponds to a minimum-distance rather than a GMM problem, and that the q-dependent weight
matrix in the objective function G(·) could be singular for some values of q 0 s. In the remainder of
this subsection it is discussed how the moment selection approach of Andrews and Soares (2010a)
can be applied to obtain critical value functions c(2) (q).

For each θ ∈ Θ(φ), we define the set Q(θ, φ) = q kqk = 1, S̃θ (q)φ = θ, S̃R (q)φ ≥ 0 as well
as the function µ̃(q, φ) = S̃R (q)φ. Let Σ̂(q) = S(q)Λ̂S(q)0 and decompose the covariance matrix
into
Σ̂(q) = D̂1/2 (q)Ω̂(q)D̂1/2 (q),
where Ω̂ is a correlation matrix and D̂1/2 is a diagonal matrix of standard deviations. Let Mµ =
[0k̃×r̃2 , Ir̃2 ]0 and consider a θ ∈ Θ(φ) and a q ∈ Q(θ, φ). Then, using the fact that the penalty term
is zero for θ ∈ Θ(φ) and q ∈ Q(θ, φ), we can rewrite (31):

Recall that V (q) eliminates elements of the vector Mµ µ̃, corresponding to rows of zeros in S̃(q).
Moreover, the matrix D̂−1/2 is diagonal. Thus, we define the r2 (q) × 1 vectors µ and µ(q, φ) as
transformation of µ̃ and µ̃(q, φ) in which the elements corresponding to rows of zeros in S̃R (q) have
been eliminated. Let D̂R be the submatrix of D̂ that is conformable with the SR (q) partition of

S(q) and define the r2 (q) × 1 vector ν = T D̂R (µ − µ(q, φ)). Moreover, define the matrix Mν by
deleting unnecessary columns from the matrix V (q)Mµ to make it conformable with ν.5 In turn,
the objective function can be expressed as

A moment condition is deemed nonbinding if ξˆj,T (q) exceeds the threshold κT , where κT is a

binding moment conditions are given by

Thus, whenever ϕ̂j,T (q) = 0, the lower bound for νj is raised to zero, and whenever ϕ̂j,T (q) = ∞,
the constraint on νj is eliminated. Let Â(q) = L̂0 S 0 (q)D̂−1/2 and define the submatrices Âb , Mνb ,
νb , and Ω̂b by deleting the rows and columns corresponding to ϕ̂j,T = ∞ (nonbinding moment

This representation highlights that the moment selection approach reduces the degrees of freedom

Confidence sets for θ of the form (33) can now be constructed by using a fixed critical value or
a simulated critical value:

ĉ(22) (q) = 1 − τ quantile of Ḡ θ, q; Ω̂b .

easily computed based on (26). Notice that either k(q) or r̂21 (q) could be equal to zero. If both

are zero, then Ḡ θ, q; φ̂, WT∗ (·) = 0 and the critical value c(0,0) = 0, which implies (θ, q) ∈ CS(2)
as required. The second critical value, ĉ(22) (q), is potentially less conservative than the first, but
requires the simulation of a stochastic quadratic programming problem.

A formal proof of Theorem 2 is provided in the Appendix and closely follows the proof of
Theorem 1 in Andrews and Soares (2010a). However, a number of modifications are required to
account for the potential rank reduction of S̃(q).
To construct a confidence set for θ, one could consider various alternatives by choosing different
objective functions and different moment selection rules, and by employing different approximation
methods for the critical values. We leave it as a future research topic to consider the alternative
approaches and compare them with the methods in the paper. For more details on the potential
alternative approaches, readers can refer to Andrews and Soares (2010a) and the references therein.

Implementation

The computation of frequentist error bands based on the confidence sets constructed in Sections 4.2
and 4.3 involves the discretization of the impulse response domain and the point-wise inversion of
test statistics based on potentially simulated critical values. Since error bands in the VAR literature
predominantly depict point-wise confidence sets, we focus on the computation of Θ(φ̂) as well as the
θ and CS θ for k = 1. This computation has to be repeated for every response

following lemma states that the confidence sets CS(i)

θ and CS θ defined in (25)
Lemma 4 Suppose that Assumption 1 is satisfied and k̃ = 1. Then CS(1)
(2)

and (33) are bounded.
The computation of the confidence sets involves minimizations with respect to q, where q is
restricted to lie on the unit hypersphere. We start by randomly generating a set of q’s as follows:
let Z(s) , s = 1, . . . , smax , be a sequence of n × 1 vectors of standard normal random variables and
define q(s) = Z(s) /kZ(s) k. It is well known, e.g., James (1954), that qs is uniformly distributed on
the unit-hypersphere defined by kqk = 1. Now define the grid Q = {q(1) , . . . , q(smax ) }.
Computing a Preliminary Interval Iθ for Θ(φ̂). A preliminary interval can be obtained as
follows:
1. Compute the estimator φ̂.
2. For each q(s) ∈ Q determine whether the responses θ(s) = S̃θ (q(s) )φ̂ and S̃θ (q(s) )φ̂ satisfy the
sign restrictions.
3. Define the boundaries of Iθ as the min and the max of the θ(s) responses that do satisfy the
sign restrictions.
Computing the Boundaries of Θ(φ̂). By construction, Iθ ⊆ Θ(φ̂). Thus, in order to find the
boundaries of Θ(φ̂), one can raise (lower) the upper (lower) bound of Iθ in a step-wise fashion, where
the step size δθ can be chosen as a fraction of the length of Iθ . Thus, assuming that θj−1 ∈ Θ(φ̂),
iteration j in the construction of the upper bound for Θ(φ̂) takes the following form:
1. Let θ(j) = θ(j−1) + δθ .
2. Compute Q(θ(j) ; φ̂, W ).
3. If Q(θ(j) ; φ̂, W ) = 0, then proceed to iteration j + 1. If Q(θ(j) ; φ̂, W ) > 0, then terminate the
iterations and set the upper bound of Θ(φ̂) to θ(j−1) .
6

Since the weight matrix W ∗ (·) used in the construction of the confidence sets is a function of q, the proof of

Lemma 4 is not general enough to establish the convexity of the confidence interval.

20
The lower bound of Iθ can be found in a similar manner. The objective function Q(θ(j) ; φ̂, W ) is
given in (18). While at this point W could be any positive-definite weight matrix, for the empirical
(1)

analysis in Section 6 we set W = Ŵ (q) and replace the threshold of zero by  = ck̃,r̃ /106 . Recall
2

from Section 4.3 that we can express the objective function Q(θ; φ̂, Ŵ ∗ ) as

(ĉ21 ) ⊆ CS(1)

where ĉ22 is the simulated critical value and ĉ21 is the more conservative fixed critical value described
in Section 4.3. The computational strategy is similar to the one used for Θ(φ̂). Two differences

21
are noteworthy. First, we use grid search only over Q to carry out minimizations with respect to
q. For all practical purposes, this grid search seemed to be sufficient in the empirical application.
Second, the computational time for the three confidence intervals decreases drastically with conservativeness. In applications with large numbers of inequality constraints, the simulated critical
value ĉ22 might take a very long time to compute. While we did not attempt to measure CPU time
θ
carefully, it turned out that for the empirical analysis in Section 6.2, the computation of the CS(1)
θ error bands with simulated
error bands took a few hours, whereas the computation of the CS(2)

critical values based on restrictions over horizons h = 0, . . . , 8 took several days on a multi-processor
θ first.
computer. Thus, we strongly recommend to start the empirical analysis by computing CS(1)

This interval can then subsequently be refined by switching to the projection-based approach.

We will subsequently provide a brief discussion of extensions and limitations of the results obtained
in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.
Profile versus Projection Approach. According to Lemma 3, the confidence set constructed
based on the projection approach (in conjunction with the selection of potentially binding moments)
weakly dominates the confidence set obtained with the profile approach. The main appeal of the
θ than CS θ . While the evaluation of r̂
profile approach is that it is faster to compute CS(1)
21 is
(2)

fairly straightforward, the calculation of the critical value c(2) (q̃) is very time consuming.
Union of Identified Sets. A conceptually straightforward approach of constructing a valid
confidence set for partially identified parameters is to take the union of identified sets Θ(φ) over
all values of φ in a 1 − τ confidence set CSτφ . According to Assumption 2, one can obtain an
asymptotically valid confidence set for the reduced form parameter as follows:

CS = φ ∈ P T φ̂ − φ Λ̂−1 ≤ c(χm ) ,
where c(χ2m ) is the 1 − τ quantile of a χ2 distribution with m degrees of freedom. Then,

The following lemma provides a convenient representation for CSUθ .

that is used to construct the level set. Since k̃ + r̃2 < m, the confidence set constructed by taking
unions of the identified-sets is more conservative than our proposed confidence sets based on the
profile and the projection approach.
Cumulative Impulse Responses. As in Section 2, consider a bivariate VAR composed of inflation and output growth, but now with nontrivial dynamics. Suppose that the sign restrictions
are specified as follows: in response to a positive demand shock, the log level of prices and output
will be nonnegative in periods 0 and 1. This case can be handled by defining the cumulative responses. It can be verified that the cumulation of responses is a special case of the quasi-triangular
transformation M S,2 . Thus, Assumption 3 is satisfied.
Sign Restrictions Combined with Zero Restrictions. In our framework it is straightforward
to sharpen the identified set by combining sign restrictions with more traditional exclusion restrictions. Zero restrictions, e.g., on the impact or long-run effect of the shock of interest on the variables
yt could be imposed in one of two ways. First, in applications in which the zero restrictions are
imposed upon the impact effect of the shock and the variables yt are ordered appropriately, the zero
restrictions easily translate into domain restrictions for q. For instance, in the application presented
in Section 6 below, we consider a four-variable VAR and can impose the equality restrictions of
interest by setting the first two elements of q equal to zero. Second and more generally, one can
modify the function Q(θ; φ, W ) in (18) as follows:
 
Q(θ; φ, W ) =

where S̃eq (q)φ corresponds to the responses that are restricted to be zero. Since the construction
of our confidence sets is based on a point-wise testing procedure that conditions on θ ∈ Θ(φ), the
inclusion of the equality restrictions essentially amounts to augmenting S̃θ (q) by S̃eq (q) and θ by a
vector of zeros. Thus, the results in Theorems 1 and 2 are directly applicable.

23
Identifying Multiple Shocks. Some authors use sign-restricted SVARs to identify multiple
shocks simultaneously. For instance, Peersman (2005) considers a n = 4 dimensional VAR, composed of oil price inflation, output growth, consumer price inflation, and nominal interest rates.
He uses sign restrictions to identify an oil price shock, aggregate demand and supply shocks, and a
monetary policy shock. To identify n shocks, the unit vector q has to be replaced by an orthogonal
matrix, and the restrictions will take the form
S̃θ (Ω)φ = θ

and S̃R (Ω)φ ≥ 0

for suitably defined functions S̃θ (Ω) and S̃R (Ω). While all our results easily generalize to multiple
shocks (just replace q by Ω in the equations in Section 4.2), the implementation becomes computationally more difficult because the objective function G(θ, Ω; φ̂, Ŵ ∗ (·)) now has to be minimized
over the domain of Ω rather than the unit hypersphere.
Variance Decompositions and Dynamic Correlations. Faust (1998) was not interested in
the impulse responses to a monetary policy shock. Instead his goal was to measure the fraction
of the variance of output explained by monetary policy shocks. Canova and De Nicolo (2002) did
not restrict the sign of impulse responses. Instead they restricted the sign of dynamic correlations
generated by structural shocks to attain partial identification. Both variance decompositions and
dynamic correlations involve objects of the form
H
X

0
,
Ch Σtr qq 0 Σ0tr Ch+j

h=0

where H is potentially infinite. Thus, our linear function S̃(q)φ would have to be replaced by a
nonlinear function of the form S̃(q, φ), which in turn needs to be approximated with a first-order
Taylor expansion. Since most of the recent empirical literature focuses on impulse responses, we
do not pursue the extension to nonlinear functions S̃(q, φ) in this paper.
Nonstationary VARs. Some authors, e.g., Uhlig (2005), specify the VAR in terms of variables
that exhibit (near) nonstationary dynamics, such as the log level of GDP, or the log levels of
consumer or commodity price indices. We assumed that φ̂ has a Gaussian limit distribution.
This assumption is violated in VARs with nonstationary endogenous variables, see Phillips (1998).
However, an extension of our analysis to VARs with unit roots or cointegration restrictions is beyond
the scope of this paper because even the construction of a uniformly valid confidence interval for φ
in such an environment is very challenging, e.g., Mikusheva (2007).

24
Error Bands versus Point Estimates. In addition to error bands, authors in practice often
report median or mean response functions for sign-restricted VARs. While these median or mean
responses are well defined in a Bayesian framework – as mean or median of the posterior distribution,
which asympotically concentrates on the identified set – they are not meaningful objects in a
frequentist framework. If θ is a scalar and hence interval-identified, one could construct a point
estimator from a minimax decision problem:
θ̂ = argminθ̃∈Θ(φ) max L(θ̃ − θ).
θ∈Θ(φ)

If the error loss function is symmetric and Θ(φ) is an interval, then it is optimal to choose the mid
point of the interval. A general analysis of minimax decision problems in interval identified models
is provided by Song (2009).

Monte Carlo Illustrations

In this section we conduct two Monte Carlo experiments to illustrate the properties of our proposed
confidence sets. The first experiment is based on the simple example of Section 2. For the second
experiment we introduce some autoregressive dynamics to examine the effect of serial correlation
on the estimation of the reduced form parameters as well as the impulse responses. The simulation
designs, summarized in Table 1, are obtained by fitting a VAR(0) to data on U.S. inflation and
GDP growth (Section 5.1) and fitting VAR(1)s to inflation and either output growth or linearly
detrended log GDP (Section 5.2).
We also provide a comparison between frequentist confidence sets and Bayesian credible sets.
The Bayesian credible sets are based on a Gaussian VAR that can be written as a linear regression
model of the form
yt0 = x0t Φ + u0t ,

ut ∼ N (0, Σ).

parameters of the VAR. We now introduce an unnormalized vector q̃ such that q = q̃/kq̃k. If
q̃ ∼ N (0, In ), then q is uniformly distributed on the hypersphere. Following Uhlig (2005), we use
an improper prior of the form
p(Φ, Σ, q̃) ∝ |Σ|−(n+1)/2 exp{−q̃ 0 q̃/2}I{(Φ, Σ, q̃) ∈ S}.

(44)

25
S denotes the set of triplets (Φ, Σ, q̃) such that the impulse responses of the corresponding structural
VAR satisfy the sign restrictions:

S = (Φ, Σ, q̃) ∃ θ ∈ Θ s.t. S̃θ (q̃/kq̃k)φ(Φ, Σ) = θ, S̃R (q̃/kq̃k)φ(Φ, Σ) ≥ 0 .
Draws from the posterior distribution of (Φ, Σ, q̃) can be easily generated with the acceptance
sampler described in Uhlig (2005). These draws can then be converted into impulse responses and
credible sets can be computed from the impulse response draws.

5.1

Experiment 1

The first Monte Carlo experiment is based on the simple example discussed in Section 2: yt = ut
where ut ∼ iidN (0, Σu ). The parameterization of the data generating process is provided in Table 1
in the column labeled Design 1. The goal is to obtain a confidence set for the response of y1,t to
1,t , denoted by θ. According to our simulation design, the identified set for θ is Θ(φ0 ) = [0, 0.578].
The objective function for the construction of the confidence set is given by (6), where the generic
weight matrix W is replaced by the optimal weight matrix W ∗ (q) in (23). The computation of
W ∗ (q) requires an estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix Λ. To obtain this estimate we
use a parametric bootstrap to approximate the sampling distribution of φ̂.7 Since r2 = 1 and the
objective function incorporates only one inequality condition - which is binding at the boundary of
θ
the confidence interval - we only compute the profile-objective-function based confidence set CS(1)
(1)

with critical value c1,1 = 3.82. The lower bound of the confidence set is equal to zero, and we find
its upper bound by step-wise expansion of the upper bound of Θ(φ0 ). To conduct the Monte Carlo
experiment, the following steps are repeated nsim times:
1. Generate a sample of size T from the data generating process.
2. Compute φ̂, Λ̂, and the upper bound of Θ(φ̂).
θ .
3. Compute the upper bound of the 90% frequentist confidence interval CS(1)

4. Compute a 90% Bayesian credible set for θ based on the Bayesian VAR given by (43) and (44).
7

Conditional on the estimate Σ̂tr we generate bootstrap samples from yt∗ = Σ̂tr vt∗ where vt∗ ∼ N (0, I2 ). For each

bootstrap sample, we compute φ̂∗ and estimate Λ̂ as the covariance matrix of φ̂∗ across bootstrap samples.

26
The results for nsim = 10 and T = 100 are plotted in Figure 1. The x − axis denotes the
iteration of the simulation algorithm. Since the lower bounds of Θ(φ0 ), Θ(φ̂), and the frequentist
confidence intervals are zero, our discussion focuses on the upper bound. We reordered the simulations according to the upper bound of Θ(φ̂). In about half of the simulations, the upper bound of
Θ(φ̂) exceeds that of Θ(φ0 ). In 9 out of 10 repetitions, each value θ ∈ Θ(φ) is contained in the freθ . The upper bound of the Bayesian credible sets essentially coincides
quentist confidence set CS(1)

with the upper bound of Θ(φ̂). This is consistent with the formula for p(θ|φ) in (4), which implies
that in this stylized model the prior density is increasing in θ, and conditional on the reduced form
parameters, peaks at the upper bound of Θ(φ). The lower bounds of the Bayesian intervals are
strictly greater than zero, which means that for our relatively large sample the Bayesian credible
intervals lie inside Θ(φ̂), a point emphasized in Moon and Schorfheide (2009).
If we increase the number of repetitions to nsim = 1, 000, then the upper bound of the identified
set is covered by the frequentist interval in 93% of the repetitions and by the Bayesian interval only
in 40% of the repetitions. Detailed results for the frequentist confidence interval are summarized
in Table 2. At a sample size of T = 5, 000, the actual coverage probability of the reduced-form
parameter confidence set CS φ equals the nominal coverage probability of 90%. The actual coverage
θ for the upper bound of Θ(φ), on the other hand, is 95% instead of 90%. Since
probability of CS(1)
θ is based
the critical value that we use to construct the impulse response confidence interval CS(1)

on an upper bound of the criterion function in which we replace the argmin with respect to q
by a specific value q̃, see (28), the resulting confidence interval is conservative. In this particular
design with k̃ = 1 and r̃2 = 1, there is no gain from the moment-selection approach and the
simulation of q-specific critical values, because at the upper of the identified set the one and only
θ
θ
moment inequality is binding. Thus, CS(1)
= CS(2)
and the discrepancy between actual and

nominal coverage probability can also be interpreted as conservativeness induced by the projection
approach.
For smaller sample sizes of T = 100 and T = 500, the coverage probability of CS φ is 82%
θ is conservative, a fairly low
and 94% and thus deviates from the desired nominal size. Since CS(1)

coverage probability for φ at T = 100 still translates into a confidence interval for θ that exceeds
θ shrinks from 0.64 for T = 100 to 0.59
the nominal coverage probability. The average length of CS(2)

for T = 5, 000. Thus, as the sample size increases, the length of the confidence interval approaches
the length of the identified set. As a comparison, the 90% Bayesian credible sets have an average
length of 0.5, which is less than the length of the identified set. From a frequentist perspective, the

27
Bayesian intervals have a coverage probability of about 45%.

5.2

Experiment 2

We now add first-order autoregressive terms to the simulation design to introduce persistence in
the endogenous variables:
yt = Φ1 yt−1 + ut ,

ut ∼ iidN (0, Σu ).

Our choices for Φ1 and Σu are summarized in Table 1 under the headings Design 2, Design 3, and
Design 4. The designs differ with respect to the persistence of the vector autoregressive process.
Design 2 is the least persistent. The eigenvalues of Φ1 are 0.871 and 0.231. Design 4 is the most
persistent with eigenvalues 0.955 and 0.498. We focus on responses at horizon h = 1, which can
be obtained from R1v = ΦΣtr . The structural parameter of interest, θ, is defined as ∂y1,t+1 /∂1,t
and we impose the sign restrictions that both θ as well as ∂y2,t+1 /∂1,t are nonnegative. To
simplify the computations, in particular the evaluation and minimization of the objective function

G θ, q; φ̂, Ŵ ∗ (·) , we do not impose sign restrictions on the responses at impact or at horizons
greater than h = 1. We follow the steps outlined in Section 5.1 to implement the Monte Carlo

experiment. A simplified representation for the objective function G θ, q; φ̂, Ŵ ∗ (·) can be found
in the Appendix.
The simulation results for confidence intervals with a nominal coverage of 90% are summarized
in Table 2. We consider sample sizes T = 100 and T = 500. As for the VAR(0), the confidence
intervals for the impulse response are generally conservative. The coverage probabilities reported
in the table refer to the upper endpoint of the identified interval Θ(φ0 ). The actual coverage
probabilities range from 92% to 98% and reflect the somewhat distorted coverage probabilities of
CS φ , which range from 83% to 95%. However, due to the conservativeness of the critical values
θ , its actual coverage probability never falls below 90%. The average
that are used to construct CS(1)

length of the confidence sets under Design 2 and Design 3 drops by about 10% as the sample size
is increased from 100 to 500 observations. For Design 4 the reduction is slightly larger than 20%.
For T = 500 the confidence intervals are about 10% longer than the identified sets.

Empirical Illustration

We now apply the previously developed methods to a four variable VAR. The vector of observables
consists of real GDP, inflation, a nominal interest rate, and real money balances. We will consider

28
two partial identification schemes for monetary policy shocks and compare the typically computed
Bayesian credible bands with the proposed frequentist error bands.

6.1

Data

The construction of the data set follows Aruoba and Schorfheide (2011). Unless otherwise noted,
the data are obtained from the FRED2 database maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis. Per capita output is defined as real GDP (GDPC96) divided by civilian noninstitutionalized
population (CNP16OV). The population series is provided at a monthly frequency and converted to
quarterly frequency by simple averaging. We take the natural log of per capita output and extract
a deterministic trend by OLS regression over the period 1959:I to 2006:IV. The deviations from
the linear trend are scaled by 100 to convert them into percentages. Inflation is defined as the log
difference of the GDP deflator (GDPDEF), scaled by 400 to obtain annualized percentage rates.
Our measure of nominal interest rates corresponds to the federal funds rate (FEDFUNDS), which is
provided at monthly frequency and converted to quarterly frequency by simple averaging. We use
the sweep-adjusted M2S series provided by Cynamon, Dutkowsky and Jones (2006). This series is
recorded at monthly frequency without seasonal adjustments. The EVIEWS default version of the
X12 filter is applied to remove seasonal variation. The M2S series is divided by quarterly nominal
GDP to obtain inverse velocity. We then remove a linear trend from log inverse velocity and scale
the deviations from trend by 100. Since our VAR is expressed in terms of real money balances, we
take the sum of log inverse velocity and real GDP. Finally, we restrict our quarterly observations
to the period from 1965:I to 2005:I. All VAR’s are estimated with p = 2 lags.

6.2

Pure Sign Restrictions

In order to make inference about the effects of a contractionary monetary policy shock, the following
sign restrictions are used to bound the identified set: in periods h = 0, 1 (i) the inflation response
is nonpositive; (ii) the interest rate response is nonnegative; (iii) real money balances do not rise
above their steady state level. Figure 2 depicts three bands: (point-wise) 90% frequentist confidence
intervals, estimated sets Θ(φ̂), and (point-wise) 90% Bayesian credible sets. The confidence intervals
are the ones obtained from the projection-based approach, using the Andrews and Soares (2010a)
θ (ĉ ) in Section 4. The two most
moment selection with simulated critical values, denoted by CS(2)
22

notable features of the error bands are that the frequentist error bands (solid) are substantially

29
wider than the Bayesian error bands (short dashes) and that the Bayesian error bands approximately
coincide with the estimated set Θ(φ̂). As explained in detail in Moon and Schorfheide (2009), in
a large sample (a sample in which uncertainty about φ is small compared with the size of Θ(φ))
the Bayesian intervals lie inside the estimated set Θ(φ̂) because in the limit essentially all the
probability mass is concentrated on Θ(φ̂) and a 90% credible interval is always a subset of the
support of the posterior distribution. The frequentist interval, on the other hand, has to extend
beyond the boundaries of Θ(φ̂) because it has to have, say, 90% coverage probability for every
element of the identified set Θ(φ), including the boundary points. From a substantive perspective,
the use of sign restrictions leaves the direction of the output response undetermined.
θ of Section 4.2 with
Figure 3 compares the profile-objective-function-based confidence set CS(1)
θ (ĉ ) and CS θ (ĉ ) of Section 4.2. As discussed previously, the
the two projection-based sets CS(2)
21
(2) 22

three sets are nested, which is also apparent from the figure. In the top panel, the sign restrictions
are imposed over the horizons h = 0 and h = 1. It turns out that the error bands are very
similar because the moment selection procedure only eliminates very few inequalities, or, in other
words, most of the inequalities seem to be binding at the boundary of the confidence sets. In
the bottom panel of Figure 3, the sign restrictions are imposed at horizons h = 0, 1, . . . , 8, which
increases the number of inequality restrictions from 6 to 27. While the gain from eliminating
θ and CS θ (ĉ ) are quite
nonbinding moment conditions in itself is relatively small, i.e., CS(1)
(2) 21

similar, replacing the conservative critical value ĉ21 by the simulated critical value ĉ22 generates
θ (ĉ ) intervals for output in the top and the
substantially smaller bands. A comparison of the CS(2)
21

bottom panel of Figure 3 suggests that expanding the horizon over which the sign restrictions are
imposed increases the uncertainty. However, the widening of the error bands is due to an increase
in the conservativeness of the confidence intervals. It turns out that the use of simulated critical
θ (ĉ ) bands indeed
values corrects the paradoxical feature: as we expand the horizon, the CS(2)
22

shrink.

6.3

Combining Sign Restrictions and Zero Restrictions

A commonly used identification assumption for monetary policy shocks is that private sector variables such as output and inflation cannot respond within the period, see for instance Boivin and
Giannoni (2006). Since the initial impact of the monetary policy shock is given by Σtr q and we
ordered the elements of yt such that output and inflation appear before interest rates and real
money balances, the identification condition implies that the first two elements of the vector q have

30
to be equal to zero. Thus, we can express q = [0, 0, cos ϕ, sin ϕ]0 , where ϕ ∈ [0, 2π]. The zero
restriction on the instantaneous inflation response replaces the sign restriction used in Section 6.2.
We maintain the other sign restrictions used previously, that is, the inflation response in period
h = 1 as well as the real money balance responses in periods h = 0 and h = 1 are nonpositive and
the interest rate responses for h = 0 and h = 1 are nonnegative.
Impulse response bands are depicted in Figure 4. The first panel compares the frequentist
θ (ĉ ), Bayesian credible bands, and the estimated sets Θ(φ̂). A comparison of Θ(φ̂)
bands CS(2)
22

in Figures 2 and 4 indicates that the use of zero restrictions reduces the size of the identified set
drastically. For instance, if the zero restrictions are imposed, the inflation response is essentially
point identified for horizons exceeding 8 quarters. As a consequence, for output as well as mediumand long-run inflation responses, the width of the frequentist and Bayesian error bands is now much
more similar than under the pure-sign-restriction scenario. However, some differences remain with
respect to the short-run inflation response. For the first two years, the frequentist intervals cover
both positive and negative inflation responses, whereas the Bayesian credible intervals suggest that
the inflation response is negative. With the zero restrictions imposed, the direction of the output
response is no longer ambiguous – it is negative over the first two years.
The bottom panel of Figure 4 provides a comparison of the three different frequentist confidence
intervals considered in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. It turns out that the two projection-based confidence
intervals are essentially indistinguishable, which means that there is no gain from simulating the
critical values. However, the projection-based intervals are noticeably narrower than the profileobjective-function based bands. It turned out that the sign restrictions imposed on the real money
balance response (not shown in the figure) are not binding. Thus, the moment selection procedure
is able to produce somewhat sharper inference.

Conclusion

This paper develops methods to construct error bands for impulse responses in VARs that are
identified based on sign restrictions. The error bands that have been reported in the literature
thus far were only meaningful from a Bayesian perspective. Our empirical application illustrates
that in partially identified VARs, frequentist error bands can be substantially wider than Bayesian
error bands. The impulse response confidence intervals are constructed through a point-wise testing
procedure, which is a technique that is widely used in models that are either weakly or only partially

31
identified. We consider three different intervals. The most conservative one is based on a profileobjective function that concentrates out the nuisance parameter q, which maps the orthogonolized
shocks into the structural shock of interest. The advantage of this confidence set is that it is easy
to compute because it relies on an asymptotic critical value that is nuisance parameter free. The
sharpest confidence intervals are obtained by a projection-approach that combines the Andrews and
Soares (2010a) moment selection procedure with simulated critical values that depend on q. Its
disadvantage is that it takes a long time to compute because each simulated critical value requires
the solution of thousands of quadratic programming problems. As a by-product, we also provide
a procedure to compute the set Θ(φ̂) for impulse responses conditional on the estimated reduced
form parameters. Since in a Bayesian analysis, the prior distribution of the impulse response
functions conditional on the reduced form parameters does not get updated, it is useful to report
the identified set conditional on some estimate, say, the posterior mean of Φ and Σ so that the
audience can judge whether the conditional prior distribution is highly concentrated in a particular
area of the identified set.

Proofs of Main Theorems

This section provides proofs for Theorems 1 and 2. The proofs make use of various lemmas that are
stated and proved in the Online Appendix that accompanies this paper. The proof of Theorem 2
closely follows the proofs provided in Andrews and Soares (2010b). However, several modifications
are needed to account for the potential row rank reduction of the matrix S̃(q).

Proof of Theorem 1: Define CPT (φ, θ) = Pφ {θ ∈ CS(1)

CPT (φ, θ).

Then there exists a sequence {φT , θT } such that θT ∈ Θ(φT ) and
AsyCP = lim infT CPT (φT , θT ).
Furthermore, there exists a subsequence {T 0 } ⊆ {T } such that
AsyCP = lim

Recall the definition Σ(q) = S(q)ΛS(q)0 . We will use the decompositions Λ(φ) = L(φ)L0 (φ) and
Σ(q) = D1/2 (q)Ω(q)D1/2 (q), where D1/2 (q) is a diagonal matrix of standard deviations and Ω(q)
is a correlation matrix. Without loss of generality we can choose a further subsequence {T 00 } ⊆
{T 0 } such that the following conditions are satisfied: (i) φT 00 −→ φ and Λ(φT 00 ) −→ Λ(φ). (ii)
r2 (qT 00 ) = r2 , k(qT 00 ) = k, and l(qT 00 ) = k + r2 . (iii) A(qT 00 ) = [D−1/2 (qT 00 )S(qT 00 )L(qT 00 )]0 −→ A
and Ω(qT 00 ) −→ A0 A > 0. Condition (ii) can be satisfied because the row dimensions are integer
valued. Condition (iii) is a consequence of Lemma B 5. Along the T 00 sequence, the rank of S(qT 00 )
stays constant.
Before proceeding with the proof, it is instructive to consider the following example. Suppose

Now consider a sequence of the form (dropping the primes) qT = [c/T, 1 − c/T ]0 , T = 1, 2, . . ., with
limT −→∞ qT = q̄ = [0, 1]0 . Notice that although the row rank of S(q̄) is one and Σ(qT ) converges
to the reduced rank and noninvertible matrix Σ(q̄), the rank of S(qT ) is l(qT ) = 2 for every T and
the following limits are well defined:

Ω(qT ) = I2 > 0.

For notational convenience from now on we denote {T 00 } as {T }. For each φT and θT ∈ Θ(φT ),
there exist qT and µT such that kqT k = 1, S̃θ (qT )φT = θT and S̃R (qT )φT = µT . Recall that for
θ ∈ Θ(φ) the penalty term that appears in (24) has to be zero. The starting point for the remainder
of the proof is the bounding function obtained in (28):

According to Lemma B 1 we can replace Ŵ ∗ (·) by W ∗ (·), which leads to the second equality. The

final equality is based on the definition ζ̂T = T L−1 (φT )(φ̂ − φT ).
For brevity, let ST = S(qT ), LT = L(φT ), ΩT = Ω(qT ), DT = D(qT ), and AT = A(qT ). We
consider the following three cases: (i) r2 ≥ 1, (ii) k = 1 and r2 = 0, and (iii) l = k = r2 = 0.

Since qT 0 ∈ Q (θT 0 , φT 0 ) , we have θT 0 = Sθ (qT 0 ) φT 0 . Moreover, the penalty term that appears
in (24) is equal to zero. Define µ (qT 0 , φT 0 ) = SR (qT 0 ) φT 0 . Then, by Lemma B 2, we have

Here we used the notation that Σ(q) = S(q)ΛS(q)0 with the factorization Σ(q) = D1/2 (q)Ω(q)D1/2 (q),

The subsequence T 00 is chosen such that the following conditions are satisfied: (i) φT 00 −→ φ
and Λ(φT 00 ) −→ Λ. (ii) k(qT 00 ) = k, r2 (qT 00 ) = r2 , l(qT 00 ) = l. (iii) For j = 1, . . . , r2 the slackness in

such that one of the following is true: (a) hj < ∞ and πj = 0; (b) hj = ∞ and πj < ∞; (c)
hj < ∞ and πj = ∞. Roughly speaking, in case (a) the slackness is small and the selection
criterion regards the inequality asymptotically as binding. In case (c) the slackness is large and
the selection criterion regards the inequality as nonbinding. (iv) [D−1/2 (qT 00 )S(qT 00 )L(φT 00 )]0 −→ A
and the correlation matrix Ω(qT 00 ) −→ A0 A > 0. Condition (ii) can be satisfied because the row

38
dimensions are integer-valued. Lemma B 5 guarantees the existence of the full rank matrix A in
condition (iv).
We now reorder the rows of S(qT 00 ) such that πj = 0 for rows j = 1, . . . , r21 and πj > 0 for
rows j = r21 + 1, . . . , r2 . Under this ordering, the moment-selection procedure will eventually
eliminate the last r22 = r2 − r21 rows of S(qT 00 ). For notational convenience, instead of using the
subsubsequence notation T 00 , we shall use T from now on. Moreover, we denote µT = µ(qT , φT ),
LT = L(φT ), DT = D(qT ), and ΩT = Ω(qT ).
In what follows we distinguish three cases: (i) l > 0 and l > r22 . When l > r22 , along the
sequence qT , either the selection criterion picks up at least one inequality as binding (i.e., r21 ≥ 1),
or Sθ (q) is not zero (i.e., k ≥ 1). (ii) l = r22 , which implies that k = 0 and r12 = 0. (iii) Finally,
we consider l = 0.
Case (i): l > 0, and l > r22 . We consider the fixed asymptotic critical value approach and the
simulated critical value approach separately.

In the preceding inequalities the critical value based on the estimated number of potentially binding
(1)

moment conditions, c(k(qT ),r̂21 (qT )) , is replaced by the critical value that depends on the number of
(1)

binding moment conditions along the qT sequence, c(k,r21 ) . The fifth line holds since P (A ∩ B) =
P (A) − P (A ∩ B c ) ≥ P (A) − P (B c ) and the sixth line is a consequence of Lemma B 8. Finally, the
last equality follows from (50). Then, we have the required result for (47).

(55)

is continuous near the 1 − τ ’th quantile. The inequality c∗(22) > 0 and the continuity near the
1 − τ ’th quantile of the distribution in (55) can be established as follows. Since it is assumed that
l > r22 and r2 ≥ 1, we have k + r21 ≥ 1. Also, it is assumed that τ < 1/2. If k ≥ 1, then the
distribution of (55) is continuous with support R+ . If k = 0 and r21 ≥ 1, the distribution of (55)
is continuous around the 1 − τ ’th quantile, since there exists at least one zero element in π ∗ and
τ < 1/2. Therefore, we have the desired result for the case of r2 ≥ 1.
Combining the results for r2 = 0 and r2 ≥ 1, two cases, r2 ≥ 1 and r2 = 0, we have established
the validity of the simulated critical values for Case (i).
Case (ii): l = r22 . In this case, we have k = 0 and r21 = 0. Also, hj → ∞ and πj > ∞ for all
j = 1, ..., r2 . When ĉ(2) (q) = ĉ(21) (q) (the fixed asymptotic critical value approach), by Lemma B 8
(1)

(1)

we have ĉ(21) (qT ) = ĉ(k(qT ),r̂21 (qT )) ≥ c(k,r21 ) with probability approaching one. Also, by definition
(1)

(1)

we have c(k,r21 ) = c(0,0) = 0. Then, as in the Case (i) of the fixed asymptotic critical value approach,
we have

where the inequality holds since ĉ(22) (qT ) ≤ ĉ∗(22) (qT ) .
By using the same argument used in (S1.23) on page 7 of Andrews and Soares (2010b), we can

as desired for Case (ii).
Case (iii): l = 0 In this case the objective function is zero, which means that θT is included in any
confidence set with a nonnegative critical value. 

Notes: Designs are obtained by estimating a VAR(0) or VAR(1) of the form yt = Φ0 + Φ1 yt−1 + ut ,
IE[ut u0t ] = Σu . We use OLS estimates, Φ entries refer to elements of Φ1 and Σij entries refer to
the (nonredundant) elements of Σu . λi (Φ1 ) is the i’th eigenvalue of Φ1 . y1,t is the log difference of
U.S. GDP deflator, scaled by 100 to convert into percentages. y2,t is either the log difference of the
U.S. GDP or deviations of the log GDP from a linear trend, scaled by 100. Design 1: inflation and
GDP growth, 1964:I to 2004:IV. Design 2: inflation and output deviations from trend, 1964:I to
2006:IV. Design 3: inflation and output growth, 1964:I to 2006:IV. Design 4: inflation and output
deviations from trend, 1983:I to 2006:IV.
