    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper takes shareholder level taxes into account in determining the performance of growth and growth and income mutual funds over the 1963-1992 period. It ranks a sample of funds on a before and after-tax basis for investors in different income classes facing various investment horizons. The differences between the relative ranking of funds on a before and after-tax basis are dramatic. especially for middle and high income investors. For instance. one fund which ranks in the 19th percentile on a pre-tax basis ranks in the 61st percentile for an upper income. taxable investor.\n\n",
