    "abstract": "\n\nWe document the effects of a comprehensive set of mergers of US consumer packaged goods manufacturers on prices, quantities, and product assortment. Across a range of specifications, we find a small average price effect of mergers (-0.6% to 1.6%) but substantial heterogeneity in effects, with a standard deviation between 5.3\u20136.7 pp. Through a model of enforcement, we find that agencies challenge mergers they expect would increase prices more than about 4%\u20138%. Modest increases in stringency would reduce prices and the prevalence of completed price-increasing mergers, with minimal impacts on blocked price-decreasing mergers, at a significantly greater agency burden.\n\n",
