    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyse the impact of Covid-19 on productivity using data from an innovative monthly firm survey panel that asks for quantitative impacts of Covid on inputs and outputs. We find total factor productivity (TFP) fell by up to 5% during 2020-21. The overall impact combined large reductions in \u2018within-firm\u2019 productivity, with an offsetting positive \u2018between-firm\u2019 effects as less productive sectors, and less productive firms within them, contracted. Despite these large pandemic effects, firms\u2019 post-Covid forecasts imply surprisingly little lasting impact on aggregate TFP. We also see significant heterogeneity over firms and sectors, with the greatest impacts in those requiring extensive in-person activity. We also ask about unmeasured inflation in the form of deteriorating product quality, finding an additional 1.4% negative impact on TFP.\n\n",
