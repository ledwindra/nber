Measuring Managerial Skill in the Mutual Fund Industry

ABSTRACT
Using the dollar-value a mutual fund manager adds as the measure of skill, we find that not only does
skill exist (the average mutual fund manager adds about $2 million per year), but this skill is persistent,
as far out as 10 years. We further document that investors recognize this skill and reward it by investing
more capital with skilled managers. Higher skilled managers are paid more and there is a strong positive
correlation between current managerial compensation and future performance.

An important principle of economics is that agents earn economic rents if and only if they
have a skill in short supply. As central as this principle is to microeconomics, surprisingly
little empirical work has addressed the question of whether or not talent is actually rewarded,
or, perhaps more interestingly, whether people without talent can earn rents. One notable
exception is the research on mutual fund managers. There, an extensive literature in financial
economics has been amassed that has focused on the question of whether stock picking or market
timing talent exists. The overall conclusion of that literature is that it does not. Considering
that mutual fund managers are amongst the highest paid members of society, this conclusion
appears to represent a challenge to the economic principle relating skill to rents. It implies that
it is possible to make economic rents without possessing a skill in short supply.
Given the importance of the question, the objective of this paper is to re-examine whether
or not mutual fund managers do earn economic rents without possessing skill. In contrast to
the existing literature, we find that the average mutual fund manager uses his talents to add
about $2 million a year. As to be expected, this skill is persistent. We show that it is possible
to predict long-term outperformance as far out as 10 years into the future. We find that the
distribution of managerial talent is consistent with the predictions of Lucas (1978) — higher
skilled managers manage larger funds and reap higher rewards. One of our most surprising
results is that investors appear to be able identify talent and compensate it. We demonstrate
that there is a tight relationship between compensation and value added. In addition, current
compensation predicts future performance.
Our methodology for measuring the value managers add differs from prior work in a number
of important respects. First we use all actively managed mutual funds thereby greatly increasing
the power of our tests. Prior work has used shorter time periods and focused attention exclusively
on funds that hold only U.S. stocks. Second, we use a tradable benchmark to evaluate managers
— all available Vanguard index funds (including balanced funds and funds that hold non-U.S.
stocks). Prior work has used benchmarks that not only are not traded (and so ignore transactions
costs) but were also not necessarily known or marketed at the time.
Finally, most prior studies use the net alpha to investors, i.e., the average abnormal return
net of fees and expenses, as the measure of managerial skill. However, as Berk and Green
(2004) argue, if managerial skill is in short supply, the net return is determined in equilibrium
by competition between investors, and not by the skill of managers. One might hypothesize,
based on this insight, that the gross alpha (the average abnormal return before fees) would be
the correct measure of managerial skill, but this hypothesis is also flawed. The gross alpha is a
return measure, not a value measure. That is, a manager who adds a gross alpha of 1% on a $10
billion fund adds more value than a manager who adds a gross alpha of 10% on a $1 million fund.
Thus the correct measure of managerial skill is the expected value the manager adds, i.e., the
product of the manager’s abnormal return (his return before fees minus the benchmark return)
1

and assets under management. This measure consists of two pieces: the amount of money the
manager takes home for himself (his fee multiplied by the assets-under-management) plus the
amount he takes from or gives to investors (the overall dollar under- or over-performance relative
to the benchmark).
The primary objective of this paper is to measure the skill of mutual fund managers. Our
perspective is therefore different from most papers in the mutual fund literature that are primarily concerned with the abnormal return investors earn in the fund. However we do provide new
insight on that question as well. Once we evaluate managers against a tradable benchmark we
no longer find evidence of underperformance. Over the time period in our sample, the equally
weighted net alpha is 3 b.p./month and the value weighted net alpha is -1 b.p./month. Neither
estimate is statistically significantly different from zero.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we briefly review the
literature. In Section 2 we derive our measure of skill and in the following section explain how
we estimate it. We describe the data in Section 4. Section 5 demonstrates that skill exists.
We then analyze how this skill is rewarded in Section 6. Section 7 investigates what portion
of managerial skill is attributable to diversification services rather than other sources such as
stock picking or market timing and the following section shows the importance of using the full
sample of active funds rather than the subset most researchers have used in the past. Section 9
concludes the paper.

Background

The idea that active mutual fund managers lack skill has its roots in the very early days of modern
financial economics (Jensen (1968)). Indeed, the original papers that introduced the Efficient
Market Hypothesis (Fama (1965, 1970)) cite the evidence that, as a group, investors in active
mutual funds underperform the market, and, more importantly, mutual fund performance is
unpredictable. Although an extensive review of this literature is beyond the scope of this paper,
the conclusion of the literature is that, as investment vehicles, active funds underperform passive
ones, and, on average, mutual fund returns before fees show no evidence of outperformance. As
we have already mentioned, this evidence is taken to imply that active managers do not have
the skills required to beat the market, and so in Burton Malkiel’s words: the “study of mutual
funds does not provide any reason to abandon a belief that securities markets are remarkably
efficient.” (Malkiel, 1995, p. 571)
In a recent paper on the subject, Fama and French (2010) re-examine the evidence and
conclude that the average manager lacks skill. They do find some evidence of talent in the
upper tail of the distribution of managers. However based on their estimate of skill (gross
alpha) they conclude that this skill is economically small. In this paper we argue that the
2

economic magnitude of skill can only be assessed by measuring the total dollar value added not
the abnormal return generated. As we will see, when the economic value added is calculated
by multiplying the abnormal return by assets under management, a completely different picture
emerges in our dataset — the top 10% of managers are able to use their skill to add about $24
million a year, on average.
Researchers have also studied persistence in mutual fund performance. Using the return
the fund makes for its investors, a number of papers (see Gruber (1996), Carhart (1997), Zheng
(1999) and Bollen and Busse (2001)) have documented that performance is largely unpredictable,
leading researchers to conclude that outperformance is driven by luck rather than talent.1 In
contrast, we show that the value added of a manager is persistent.
Despite the widespread belief that managers lack skill, there is in fact a literature in financial
economics that does find evidence of skill. One of the earliest papers is Grinblatt and Titman
(1989), which documents positive gross alphas for small funds and growth funds. In a followup
paper (Grinblatt and Titman (1993)) these authors show that at least for a subset of mutual
fund managers, stocks perform better when they are held by the managers than when they are
not. Wermers (2000) finds that the stocks mutual funds hold outperform broad market indices,
and Chen, Jegadeesh, and Wermers (2000) find that the stocks managers buy outperform the
stocks that they sell. Kosowski, Timmermann, Wermers, and White (2006) use a bootstrap
analysis and find evidence, using gross and net alphas, suggesting that 10% of managers have
skill. Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008) compare the actual performance of funds to the
performance of the funds’ beginning of quarter holdings and find that for the average fund,
performance is indistinguishable, suggesting superior performance gross of fees and thus implying
that the average manager adds value during the quarter. Cremers and Petajisto (2009) show
that the amount a fund deviates from its benchmark is associated with better performance, and
that this superior performance is persistent. Finally, Cohen, Polk, and Silli (2010) and Jiang,
Verbeek, and Wang (2011) show that this performance results from overweighing stocks that
subsequently outperform the stocks that are underweighted.
There is also evidence suggesting where this skill comes from. Coval and Moskowitz (2001)
find that geography is important — funds that invest a greater proportion of their assets locally
do better. Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2005) find that funds that concentrate in industries
do better than funds that do not. Baker, Litov, Wachter, and Wurgler (2010) show that,
around earnings announcement dates, stocks that active managers purchase outperform stocks
they sell and Shumway, Szefler, and Yuan (2009) produce evidence that superior performance
is associated with beliefs that more closely predict future performance. Cohen, Frazzini, and
Malloy (2007) find that portfolio managers place larger bets on firms they are connected to

Some evidence of persistence does exist in low liquidity sectors or at shorter horizons, see, for example, Bollen
and Busse (2005), Mamaysky, Spiegel, and Zhang (2008) or Berk and Tonks (2007).

through their social network, and perform significantly better on these holdings relative to their
non-connected holdings. These studies suggest that the superior performance documented in
other studies in this literature is likely due to specialized knowledge and information.
Yet many researchers in financial economics remain unconvinced that mutual fund managers
have skill. This reticence to accept the above evidence is at least partly attributable to the lack
of any convincing evidence of the value added that results from this talent. Our objective is to
provide this evidence.

investors in the i’th fund at time t. This return can be split up into the return of the investor’s
B , which we will call the manager’s benchmark,
next best alternative investment opportunity Rit

and a deviation from the benchmark εit :

+ εit ,

(1)

The most commonly used measure of skill in the literature is the mean of εit , or the net alpha,
denoted by αni . Assuming that the benchmark return is observed (we relax this assumption
later), the net alpha can be consistently estimated by:

where Ti is the number of periods that fund i appears in the database.
As we pointed out in the introduction, the net alpha is a measure of the abnormal return
earned by investors, not the skill of the manager. To understand why, recall the intuition that
Eugene Fama used to motivate the Efficient Market Hypothesis — just as the expected return
of a firm does not reflect the quality of its management, neither does the expected return of a
mutual fund. Instead, what the net alpha measures is the rationality and competitiveness of
capital markets. A zero net alpha indicates that markets are competitive and investors rational.
A positive net alpha implies that capital markets are not competitive, that the supply of capital
is insufficient to compete away the abnormal return. A negative net alpha implies that investors
are committing too much capital to active management — it is evidence of sub-optimality on
the part of at least some investors.2
Some have argued that the gross alpha, αgi , the abnormal return earned by fund i before

the gross excess return, or the excess return the manager makes before he takes out his fee fit :

Unfortunately, gross alpha does not measure the skill of a manager either. Just as the internal
rate of return cannot be used to measure the value of an investment opportunity (it is the net
present value that does), the gross alpha cannot be used to measure the value of a manager. It
measures the return the manager makes, not the value she adds.
To correctly measure the skill of the manager, one has to measure the dollar value of what
the manager adds over the benchmark. To compute this measure, we multiply the benchmark
g
B , by the real size of the fund (assets under management
adjusted realized gross return, Rit
− Rit

adjusted by inflation) at the end of the previous period, qi,t−1 , to obtain the realized value added
between times t − 1 and t:

g
B
Vit ≡ qi,t−1 Rit
− Rit
= qi,t−1 fi,t + qi,t−1 εit ,

(5)

where the second equality follows from (3). This estimate of value added consists of two parts —
the part the manager takes home with him as compensation (the dollar value of all fees charged),
which is necessarily positive, plus any value he provides (or extracts from) investors, which can
be either positive or negative. Our measure of skill is the (time series) expectation of (5):
Si ≡ E[Vit ].

(6)

For a fund that exists for Ti periods this estimated value added is given by:
Ŝi =

Ti
X
Vit
t=1

Ti

.

(7)

The average value added can be estimated in one of two ways. If we are interested in the
mean of the distribution managers are drawn from, what we term the ex-ante distribution, then

5

a consistent estimate of average value added is given by:
N
1 X
Ŝi ,
S̄ =
N

(8)

i=1

where N is the number of mutual funds in our database. Alternatively we might be interested
in the mean of surviving funds, what we term the ex-post distribution. In this case the average
value added is estimated by weighting each fund by the number of periods that it appears in
the database:

PN

S̄W = Pi=1
N

Ti Ŝi

i=1 Ti

.

(9)

Before we turn to how we actually compute Vit and therefore Si , it is worth first considering
what the main hypotheses in the literature imply about this measure of skill.
Unskilled managers, irrational investors
A widely accepted hypothesis and the one considered in Fama and French (2010) is that no
manager has skill. We call this the strong form no-skill hypothesis, originally put forward by
Eugene Fama in his Efficient Market papers. Because managers are unskilled and yet charge
fees, these fees can only come out of irrational investors’ pockets. These managers can either
invest in the index, in which case they do not destroy value, or worse than that, follow the classic
example of “monkey investing” by throwing darts and incurring unnecessary transaction costs.
So under this hypothesis:
Si ≤ 0, for every i,

(10)

αni ≤ −E (fit ) , for every i.

(11)

Because no individual manager has skill, the average manager does not have skill either. Thus
this hypothesis also implies that we should expect to find
N
1 X
S̄ =
Ŝi ≤ 0.
N

(12)

i=1

The latter equation can also be tested in isolation. We term this the weak form no-skill hypothesis. This weak-form hypothesis states that even though some individual managers may
have skill, the average manager does not, implying that at least as much value is destroyed by
active mutual fund managers as is created. We will take this two part hypothesis as the Null
Hypothesis in this paper.
Skilled managers, rational investors
The second hypothesis we consider is motivated by Berk and Green (2004) and states that
managers have skill that is in short supply. Because of competition in capital markets, investors
6

do not benefit from this skill. Instead, managers derive the full benefit of the economic rents
they generate from their skill. If investors are fully rational then these assumptions imply that
the net return investors expect to make is equal to the benchmark return. That is:
αni = 0, for every i.

(13)

Because fees are positive, the expected value-added is positive for every manager:
Si > 0, for every i.

(14)

When investors cannot observe skill perfectly, the extent to which an individual manager actually
adds value depends on the ability of investors to differentiate talented managers from charlatans.
If we recognize that managerial skill is difficult to measure, then one would expect unskilled
managers to take advantage of this uncertainty. In this case we would expect to observe the
presence of charlatans — managers who charge a fee but have no skill. Thus when skill cannot
be perfectly observed, it is possible that for some managers Si ≤ 0. However, even when skill is
not perfectly observable, because investors are rational, every manager must still add value in
expectation. Hence, under this hypothesis, the average manager must generate value and hence
we would expect to find:
S̄ > 0.

(15)

We will take this hypothesis as the Alternative Hypothesis in this paper.
Some have claimed, based on Sharpe (1991), that in a general equilibrium it is impossible
for the average manager to add value. In fact this argument has two flaws. To understand the
flaws, it is worth quickly reviewing Sharpe’s original argument. Sharpe divided all investors into
two sets: people who hold the market portfolio, who he called “passive” investors and the rest,
who he called “active” investors. Because market clearing requires that the sum of active and
passive investors’ portfolios is the market portfolio, the sum of just active investors’ portfolios
must also be the market portfolio. This observation immediately implies that the abnormal
return of the average active investor must be zero. As convincing as the argument appears to
be, it cannot be used to conclude that the average active mutual fund manager cannot add value.
In his definition of “active” investors, Sharpe includes any investor not holding the market, not
just active mutual fund managers. If active individual investors exist, then as a group active
mutual fund managers could provide a positive abnormal return by making trading profits from
individual investors who make a negative abnormal return. Of course, as a group individual
active investors are better off investing in the market, which leaves open the question of why
these individuals are actively trading.
Perhaps more surprisingly to some, Sharpe’s argument does not rule out the possibility that
the average active manager can earn a higher return than the market return even if all investors,
7

including individual investors, are assumed to be fully rational. What Sharpe’s argument ignores
is that even a passive investor must trade at least twice, once to get into the passive position
and once to get out of the position. If we assume that active investors are better informed than
passive, then whenever these liquidity trades are made with an active investor, in expectation,
the passive investor must lose and the active must gain. Hence, the expected return to active
investors must exceed the return to passive investors, that is, active investors earn a liquidity
premium.

Choice of Benchmarks and Estimation

To measure the value the mutual fund manager either gives or takes from investors, her performance must be compared to the performance of the next best investment opportunity available
to investors at that time, what we have termed the benchmark. Thus far we have assumed that
this benchmark return is known. In reality it is not known, so in this section we describe two
methods we use to identify the benchmark.
The standard practice in financial economics is to not actually construct the alternative
investment opportunity itself, but rather simply adjust for risk using a factor model. In recent
years the extent to which factor models accurately correct for risk has been subject to extensive
debate. In response to this, mutual fund researchers have opted to construct the alternative
investment opportunity directly instead of using factor models to adjust for risk. That is,
they have interpreted the factors in the factor models as investment opportunities available to
investors, rather than risk factors.3 The problem with this interpretation is that these factor
portfolios were (and in some cases are) not actually available to investors.
There are two reasons investors cannot invest in the factor portfolios. The first is straightforward: these portfolios do not take transaction costs into account. For example, the momentum
strategy requires high turnover, which not only incurs high transaction costs, but also requires
time and effort to implement. Consequently momentum index funds do not exist. The second
is more subtle. Many of these factor portfolios were discovered well after the typical starting
date of mutual fund databases. For example, when the first active mutual funds started offering size and value-based strategies, the alternative investment opportunity set was limited to
investments in individual stocks and well-diversified index funds. That is, these active managers
were being rewarded for the skill of finding a high return strategy that was not widely known.
It has taken a considerable amount of time for most investors to discover these strategies, and
so using portfolios that can only be constructed with the benefit of hindsight ignores the skill
required to uncover these strategies in real time.
3

See, for example, Fama and French (2010). Note that interpreting the benchmarks as alternative investment
opportunities is not the same argument as the one made by Pastor and Stambaugh (2002) for using benchmarks.

8

For these reasons we take two approaches to measuring skill in this paper. First, we follow
the recent literature by adopting a benchmark approach and taking a stand on the alternative
investment opportunity set. Where we depart from the literature, however, is that we ensure
that this alternative investment opportunity was marketed and tradable at the time. Because
Vanguard mutual funds are widely regarded as the least costly method to hold a well diversified
portfolio, we take the set of passively managed index funds offered by Vanguard as the alternative
investment opportunity set.4 We then define the benchmark as the closest portfolio in that set
to the mutual fund. If Rtj is the excess return earned by investors in the j’th Vanguard index
fund at time t, then the benchmark return for fund i is given by:
B
Rit

=

n(t)
X

β ji Rtj ,

(16)

j=1

where n(t) is the total number of index funds offered by Vanguard at time t and β ji is obtained
from the appropriate linear projection of the i’th active mutual fund onto the set of Vanguard
index funds. By using Vanguard index funds as benchmarks, we can be certain that investors
had the opportunity to invest in the funds at the time and that the returns of these funds
necessarily include transaction costs and reflect the dynamic evolution of active strategies.5
Second, we use the traditional risk-based approach. The standard in the literature implicitly
assumes the riskiness of the manager’s portfolio can be measured using the factors identified
by Fama and French (1995) and Carhart (1997), hereafter, the Fama-French-Carhart (FFC)
factor specification. In this case the benchmark return is the return of a portfolio of equivalent
riskiness constructed from the FFC factor portfolios:
B
hml
Rit
= β mkt
MKTt + β sml
HMLt + β umd
UMDt
i
i SMLt + β i
i

where MKTt , SMLt , HMLt and UMDt are the realizations of the four factor portfolios and β ·i are
risk exposures of the i’th mutual fund, which can be estimated by regressing the fund’s return
onto the factors. Although standard practice, this approach has the drawback that no theoretical
argument exists justifying why these factors measure systematic risk in the economy. Fama and
French (2010) recognize this limitation but argue that one can interpret the factors as simply
alternative (passive) investment opportunities. As we point out above, such an interpretation is
4

The ownership structure of Vanguard — it is owned by the investors in its funds — also makes it attractive
as a benchmark because there is no conflict of interest between the investors in the fund and the fund owners.
Bogle (1997) provides a brief history of Vanguard’s index fund business.
5
Notice, also, that if we used this benchmark to evaluate the manager of one of the Vanguard index funds
themselves, we would get that this manager adds value equal to the dollar value of the fees he charges. Vanguard
managers add value because they provide investors with the lowest cost means to diversification. By using net
returns on Vanguard index funds we are explicitly accounting for the value added of diversification services.
Because active managers also provide diversification services our measure credits them with this value added as
well. We separate the value added from diversification and other skills in Section 7.

Table 1: Benchmark Vanguard Index Funds: This table lists the set of Vanguard Index
Funds used to calculate the Vanguard benchmark. The listed ticker is for the Investor class
shares which we use until Vanguard introduced an Admiral class for the fund, and thereafter we
use the return on the Admiral class shares (Admiral class shares have lower fees but require a
higher minimum investment.)
*NAESX was introduced earlier but was originally not an index fund. It was converted to an index fund in late
1989, so the date in the table reflects the first date we included the fund in the benchmark set.

We picked eleven Vanguard index funds to use as benchmark funds – see Table 1. We arrived
at this set by excluding all bond or real estate index funds and any fund that was already spanned
by existing funds.6

Because the eleven funds do not exist throughout our sample period, we

first arrange the funds in order of how long they have been in existence. We then construct
an orthogonal basis set out of these funds by projecting the nth fund onto the orthogonal basis
produced by the first n − 1 funds over the time period when the nth fund exists. The mean
plus residual of this projection is the nth fund in the orthogonal basis. In the time periods in
which the nth basis fund does not exist, we insert zero. We then construct an augmented basis
by replacing the zero in the time periods when the basis fund does not exist with the mean
return of the basis fund when it does exist. We show in the appendix that value added can
be consistently estimated by first computing the projection coefficients (β ji in (16)) using the
augmented basis and then calculating the benchmark return using (16) and the basis where
missing returns are replaced with zeros.
To quantify the advantages of using Vanguard funds rather than the FFC factor mimicking
portfolios as benchmark funds, Table 2 shows the results of regressing each FFC factor mimicking

portfolio on the basis set of passively managed index funds offered by Vanguard. Only the
market portfolio does not have a statistically significant positive alpha. Clearly, the FFC factor
mimicking portfolios were better investment opportunities than what was actually available to
investors at the time. In addition, the R2 of the regressions are informative. The value/growth
strategy became available as an index fund after size, so it is not surprising that the R2 of the
SMB portfolio is higher than the HML portfolio. Furthermore, the momentum strategy involves
a large amount of active trading, so it is unlikely to be fully captured by passive portfolios,
which accounts for the fact that the UMD portfolio has the lowest R2 and the highest alpha.

Benchmark portfolios. The table lists the estimate (in b.p./month) and t-statistic of the constant
term (Alpha) of each regression, as well as the R2 of each regression.
Given that the alpha of the FFC factor mimicking portfolios are positive, and that they do
not represent actual investable alternatives, they cannot be interpreted as benchmark portfolios.
Of course the FFC factor specification might still be a valid measure of risk. For completeness,
we will report our results using both methods to calculate the fund’s alpha, but we will always
interpret the Vanguard funds as benchmark portfolios and the FFC factor specification as an
adjustment for risk.

Data

Our main source of data is the CRSP survivorship bias free database of mutual fund data first
compiled in Carhart (1997). The data set spans the period from January 1962 to March 2011.
Although this data set has been used extensively, it still has a number of important shortcomings
that we needed to address in order to complete our study. As a result we undertook an extensive
data project to address these shortcomings, the details of which are described in a 17 page online
appendix to this paper. The main outcome of this project is reported below.
Even a casual perusal of the returns on CRSP is enough to reveal that some of the reported returns are suspect. Because part of our objective is to identify highly skilled managers,
misreported returns, even if random, are of concern. Hence we procured additional data from
Morningstar. Each month, Morningstar sends a complete updated database to its clients. The
monthly update is intended to completely replace the previous update. We purchased every up11

date from January 1995 through March 2011, and constructed a single database by combining
all the updates. One major advantage of this database is that it is guaranteed to be free of
survivorship bias. Morningstar adds a new fund or removes an old fund in each new monthly
update. By definition, it cannot change an old update because its clients already have that data.
So we are guaranteed that in each month whatever data we have was the actual data available
to Morningstar’s clients at that time.
We then compared the returns reported on CRSP to what was reported on Morningstar.
Somewhat surprisingly, 3.3% of return observations differed. Even if we restrict attention to
returns that differ by more than 10 b.p., 1.3% of the data is inconsistent. An example of this
is when a 10% return is accidentally reported as “10.0” instead of “0.10”. To determine which
database is correct we used dividend and net asset value (NAV) information reported on the
two databases to compute the return. In cases in which in one database the reported return
is inconsistent with the computed return, but the other database was consistent, we used the
consistent database return. If both databases were internally consistent, but differed from each
other, but within 6 months one data base was internally inconsistent, we used the database that
was internally consistent throughout. Finally, we manually checked all remaining unresolved
discrepancies that differed by more than 20 b.p. by comparing the return to that reported on
Bloomberg. All told, we were able to correct about two thirds of the inconsistent returns. In all
remaining cases we used the return reported on CRSP.
Unfortunately, there are even more discrepancies between what Morningstar and CRSP
report for total assets under management (AUM). Even allowing for rounding errors, fully
16% of the data differs across the two databases. Casual observation reveals that much of
this discrepancy appears to derive from Morningstar often lagging CRSP in updating AUM.
Consequently, when both database report numbers we use the numbers reported on CRSP
with one important exception. If the number reported on CRSP changed by more than 8×
(we observed a number of cases where the CRSP number is off by a fixed number of decimal
places) and within a few months the change was reversed by the same order of magnitude,
and, in addition, this change was not observed on Morningstar, we used the value reported on
Morningstar.

Unfortunately both databases contained significant numbers of missing AUM

observations. Even after we used both databases as a source of information, 17.2% of the data
was missing. In these cases we filled any missing observation by the most recent observation
in the past. Finally we adjusted all AUM numbers by inflation by expressing all numbers in
January 1, 2000 dollars.
The amount of missing expense ratio data posed a major problem.7 To compute the gross
return, expense ratios are needed and over 40% of expense ratios are missing on the CRSP

Because fees from an important part of our skill measure, we chose not to follow Fama and French (2010) by
filling in the missing expense ratios with the average expense ratios of funds with similar AUM.

database. Because expense ratios are actually reported annually by funds, we were able to fill
in about 70% of these missing values by extending any reported observation during a year to
the entire fiscal year of the fund and combining the information reported on Morningstar and
CRSP. We then went to the SEC website and manually looked up the remaining missing values
on EDGAR. At the end of this process we were missing only 1.6% of the observations, which we
elected to drop.
Both databases report data for active and passively managed funds. CRSP does not provide
any way to discriminate between the funds. Morningstar provides this information, but the
accuracy of their classification is suspect. In addition we only have this information after 1995
when the Morningstar database begins. We therefore augmented the Morningstar classification
by using the following algorithm to identify passively managed funds. We first generate a list
of common phrases that appear in fund names identified by Morningstar as index funds. We
then compile a list of funds with these common phrases that were not labeled as index funds by
Morningstar and compile a second list of common phrases from these funds’ names. We then
manually checked the original prospectuses of any fund that contained a word from the first list
but was not identified as an index fund at any point in its life by Morningstar or was identified
as an index fund at some point in its life by Morningstar but nevertheless contained a phrase in
the second list. Funds that were not tracked by Morningstar (e.g., only existed prior to 1995)
that contained a word from the first list were also manually checked. Finally, we also manually
checked cases in which fund names satisfied any of these criteria in some periods but not in
others even when the Morningstar classification was consistent with our name classification to
verify that indeed the fund had switched from active to passive or vice versa. We reclassified 14
funds using this algorithm.
It is important to identify subclasses of mutual funds because both databases report subclasses as separate funds. In most cases the only difference amongst subclasses is the amount
of expenses charged to investors, so simply including them as separate funds would artificially
increase the statistical significance of any identified effect. For funds that appear in the CRSP
data base, identifying subclasses is a relatively easy process — CRSP provides a separator in the
fund name (either a “:” or a “/”). Information after the separator denotes a subclass. Unfortunately, Morningstar does not provide this information, so for mutual funds that only appear
on the Morningstar database we used the last word in the fund name to identify the subclass
(the details of how we did this are in the online appendix). Once identified we aggregated all
subclasses into a single fund.
We dropped all index funds, bond funds and money market funds8 and any fund observations
before the fund’s (inflation adjusted) AUM reached $5 million. We also dropped funds with less

We classed a fund as a bond fund if it held, on average, less than 50% of assets in stocks and identified a
money market fund as a fund that on average held more than 20% of assets in cash.

than 2 years of data. In the end we were left with 6054 equity funds. This sample is considerably
larger than comparable samples used by other researchers. There are a number of reasons for this.
Firstly, we do not restrict attention to funds that hold only U.S. equity. Clearly, managerial skill,
if it exists, could potentially be used to pick non-U.S. stocks. More importantly, by eliminating
any fund that at any point holds a single non-U.S. or bond, researchers have been eliminating
managers who might have had the skill to market time by opportunistically moving capital
either in and out of bonds or to and from the U.S.9 Second, the Morningstar database contains
funds not reported on CRSP. Third, we use the longest possible sample length available.
When we use the Vanguard benchmark to compute alpha we chose to begin the sample in
the period just after Vanguard introduced its S&P 500 index fund — January, 1977. Because
few funds dropped out of the database prior to that date, the loss in data is minimal — we are
still left with 5974 funds.
9

It is important to appreciate that most of the additional funds still hold mainly U.S. stocks, it is just that
they also hold some non-U.S. stocks. As we will discuss in Section 7 expanding the sample to all equity funds is
not innocuous — not only is the statistical power of our tests greatly increased but, more importantly, we will
show that managerial skill is correlated to the fraction of capital in non-U.S. stocks.

Results

We begin by measuring managerial skill and then show that the skill we measure is persistent.

5.1

Measuring Skill

We begin by first estimating Si for every fund in our sample. Because Si is the product of the
abnormal return and fund size, one may have concerns about whether the product is stationary.
Figure 1 allays such concerns — median fund size has remained roughly the same over our
sample period. As the black solid line in the figure makes clear, growth in the industry’s assets
under management is driven by increases in the number of funds rather than increases in fund
size.
Table 3 provides the distribution of Si in our sample. The average manager adds an economically significant $140,000 per month (in Y2000 dollars). The standard error of this average is
just $30,000, implying at t-statistic of 4.57. There is also large variation across funds. The least
skilled manager amongst the top 1% of managers generated $7.82 million per month. Even the
least skilled manager amongst the top 10% of managers generated $750,000 a month on average.
The median manager lost an average of $20,000/month and only 43% of managers had positive
estimated value added. In summary, most funds destroyed value but because most of the capital
is controlled by skilled managers, on average, active mutual funds added value.
Thus far we have ignored survivorship bias, that is, successful funds are more likely to survive
than unsuccessful funds. Equivalently, one can think of the above statistics as estimates of the
ex-ante distribution of talent. We can instead take account of the survivorship bias and compute
the time-weighted mean given by (9). In this case we get an estimate of the ex-post distribution
of talent. Not surprisingly this estimate is higher. The average manager added $270,000/month.
When we use the FFC factor specification to correct for risk, we obtain very similar results.10
It is tempting, based on the magnitude of our t-statistics to conclude that the Null (in both
weak and strong form) can be rejected. However, caution is in order. There two reasons to
believe that our t-statistics are overstated. First, there is likely to be correlation in value added
across funds. Second, the value added distribution features excess kurtosis. Even though our
panel includes 6000 funds and 411 months, the sample might not be large enough to ensure
that the t-statistic is t-distributed. However, a central tenant of the literature on skill in mutual
fund management is that if indeed managers have skill, then their skill should be persistent.
Consequently, if the value added identified in Table 3 results from managerial skill rather than
just luck, we must also see evidence that this measure of value added is persistent — managers
that added value in the past should continue to add value in the future.
10
For the reasons pointed out in Lillainmaa (2012) our measures of value added underestimates the true skill
of managers.

Table 3: Value Added (Ŝi ): For every fund in our database we estimate the monthly value
added, Ŝi . The Cross-Sectional mean, standard error, t-statistic and percentiles are the statistical properties of this distribution. Percent with less than zero is the fraction of the distribution
that has value added estimates less than zero. The Cross-Sectional Weighted mean, standard
error and t-statistic are computed by weighting by the number of periods the fund exists, that
is, they are the statistical properties of S̄W defined by (9). The numbers are reported in Y2000
$ millions per month.
To test for persistence we follow the existing literature and sort funds into deciles based on
our inference of managerial skill. To infer skill at time τ , we construct what we will term, the
Skill Ratio, defined as:
SKRiτ ≡

and σ(Ŝi ) =

τ

. The skill ratio at any point in time is

essentially the t-static of the value added estimate measured over the entire history of the fund
until that time.11 We term the time period from the beginning of the fund to τ the sorting period.
That is, the funds in the 10th (top) decile are the funds where we have the most confidence that

For ease of exposition, we have assumed that the fund that starts at time 1. For a fund that starts later, the
start date in the skill ratio is adjusted to reflect this.

16

the actual value added over the sorting period is positive. Similarly, funds in the 1st (bottom)
decile are funds where we have the most confidence that the actual value added in the sorting
period is negative. We then measure the average value added of funds in each decile over a
specified future time horizon, hereafter the measurement horizon.12
The main difficulty with implementing this strategy is uncertainty in the estimate of the
fund’s betas. When estimation error in the sorting period is positively correlated to the error
in the measurement horizon, a researcher could falsely conclude that evidence of persistence
exists when there is no persistence. To avoid this bias we do not use information from the
sorting period to estimate the betas in the measurement horizon. This means that we require
a measurement horizon of sufficient length to produce reliable beta estimates, so the shortest
measurement horizon we consider is 3 years.
At the beginning of each time horizon, we use all the information until that point in time to
sort firms into 10 deciles based on the skill ratio. As before we require a fund to have at least
2 years of data to be included in the sort. For each fund in each decile, we then calculate the
value added, Ŝi,τ +m→τ +h , over different measurement horizons, h, varying between 36 to 120
months using only the information in the measurement horizon. Because we need a minimum
number of months, m, to estimate the fund’s betas in the measurement horizon, we drop all
funds with less data than m. To remove the obvious selection bias, for the remaining funds we
drop the first m value added observations as well. Because the Vanguard Benchmark has at
most 11 factors plus the constant, we use m = 18. We use m = 6 when we adjust for risk using
the FFC factor specification. We then average over funds in each decile in each month, that is,
we compute, for each decile, a monthly average value added. At the end of the horizon, funds
are again sorted into deciles based on the skill ratio at that time and the process is repeated
as many times as the data allows.13 At the end of the process, in each decile, we have a time
series of monthly estimates for average value added. For each decile, we then compute the mean
of this time series and its standard error. Figure 2 plots this mean as well as the two standard
error bounds for each decile and time horizon.
From Figure 2 it appears that there is evidence of persistence as far out as 10 years. The
point estimate of the average value added of 10th decile managers is positive at every horizon
and is always the best preforming decile. The value added estimates are economically large.
Although clearly noisy, the average tenth decile manager adds around $2 million/month. Table
4 formally tests the Null Hypothesis that the value added of 10th decile is zero or less, under
the usual asymptotic assumptions. The Null is rejected at every horizon at the 95% confidence
interval, however, as we have noted above we have concerns about the validity of the t-test.14
12

Similar results obtain if we use the value added estimate itself to sort funds.
We choose the starting point to ensure that the last month is always included in the sample.
14
The earlier concerns are less important in this case because in each month we average over funds so the
t-statistic is calculated using time series observations of the decile mean, thereby substantially reducing the effect

Table 4: Out-of-sample Performance of the Top Decile: The two columns labeled “Value
Added” report the average value added of the top decile at each horizon and the associated
p-value. The next two columns report the fraction of the time and associate p-value the top
decile has a higher value added realization than the bottom decile. The columns labeled “Top in
Top Half” report the fraction of time the realized value added of the top decile is in the top half
and the final column reports the average fraction of total AUM in the top decile. All p-values
are one tailed, that is, the probability, under the Null of the observed value or greater.
If managers are skilled, and there are cross-sectional differences in the amount of skill, then
relative performance will be persistent. Hence we can use relative performance comparisons to
construct a more powerful test of the Null hypothesis (that skill does not exist) by counting the
number of times the 10th decile outperforms the 1st, and the number of times the 10th decile
is in the top half.15 As is evident from Table 4, the Null Hypothesis can be rejected at the
95% confidence level at almost all horizons. The FFC factor specification produces much more
definitive results — with the sole exception of the 9 year horizon, the Null can be rejected at
the 99% confidence level. Finally, note from the final column of Table 4 the disproportionate
share of capital controlled by 10th decile managers. Investors clearly reward skilled managers
of cross fund correlation and excess kurtosis.
15
Because the volatility of the deciles varies, we restrict attention to tests where the probability under the Null
is not a function of the volatility of the decile.

by providing them with more capital.
It might be tempting, based on our sorts, to conclude that all the skill is concentrated in
10th decile managers, that is, at most 10% of managers actually have skill. But caution is in
order here. Our sorts are unlikely to separate skill perfectly. Although the estimates of value
added in the other deciles are not significantly different from zero, they are almost all positive.
Since we know that many managers destroyed value over the sample period, these positive point
estimates imply that enough skilled managers are distributed throughout the other deciles to
overcome the significant fraction of managers that destroy value.

5.2

Returns to Investors

Given the evidence of skill, a natural question to ask is who benefits from this skill? That is,
do mutual fund managers (companies) capture all the rents from their skill, or are these rents
shared with investors? Table 5 provides summary evidence. The average net alpha across all
funds is not significantly different from zero, so there is no evidence that investors share in the
fruits of this skill.
Slightly lower net alpha estimates are produced when the FFC factors are used as a measure
of risk. But, as we have noted, relying on these estimates requires the additional assumption
that this model correctly measures risk.

6

Skill and Labor Market Efficiency

To see how realized value added is cross-sectionally distributed in the sample, we sorted funds
into deciles based on the Skill Ratio calculated over the whole sample. The first row of Table 6
gives the average value added in each decile. There is clearly large variation in the data. The
worst decile destroyed almost $800,000 (Y2000) per month while the largest decile added about

$2 million. Only the top 4 deciles added value, but managers in these deciles controled 52% of
the capital under management. Realized net-alpha increases over the deciles. Interestingly, the
realized net alpha is greater than zero for all the deciles that added value and is less than zero in
all deciles that destroyed value. At least ex-post, managers that added value also gave up some
of this value to their investors.
What about ex-ante? That is, would an investor who identified a skilled manager based on
passed data have expected a positive net alpha? To investigate this possibility, we calculate the
average net alpha of investing in the out-of-sample sorts. That is, in each decile, for each fund

net abnormal return of each decile. At the end of the process, in each decile, we have a time

series of monthly estimates for the weighted average net alpha of each decile. The time series
represents the strategy of investing $1 in each month in a value weighted portfolio of funds in
the decile. That is, the strategy represents the return of an extra marginal dollar invested in
each decile. To get the average net alpha of this strategy, we compute the mean of this time
series and its standard error. Figure 3 plots this mean as well as the two standard error bounds
for each decile and time horizon.
Almost all net alpha estimates are not statistically significantly different from zero. As
we show in Table 7, the point estimates of the tenth decile are very close to zero and mostly
negative. The order statistics in Table 7 confirm the overall impression from Figure 3, there is
weak evidence of predictability in net alpha. Of the 16 order statistics, 7 of them have a one
tailed p-value below 5% and only two are below 1%. So, at best, there is weak evidence that by
picking the best managers, investors can get better returns than by picking the worst managers.
23

The evidence appears more consistent with the idea that competition in capital markets drives
net alphas close to zero.
In this case there is a striking difference when we use the FFC factor specification as a risk
adjustment — there is strong, statistically significant evidence of relative performance differences
across the deciles (all but 3 of the order statistics are below 1% in this case). Both Figure 3
and Table 7 provide convincing out of sample evidence that investors could have done better by
picking managers based on the Skill Ratio. These out of sample net alpha results are intriguing
because they imply that either investors are leaving money on the table (not enough funds are
flowing to the best managers resulting in positive net alphas), or investors do not care about
the net alpha relative to the FFC factor specification, raising the possibility that the FFC factor
specification does not measure risk investors care about.

Figure 4: Out of Sample Compensation
The plots display the average out of sample monthly compensation of each decile sorted on the
Skill Ratio using the Vanguard Benchmark and the FFC risk adjustment. Each line in the plots
represents a different horizon, which varies between 3 and 10 years. For ease of comparison the
data sample (time period) is the same for both plots.
The evidence actually paints a picture of remarkable labor market efficiency. First note,
from Table 6, that the percentage fee is relatively constant across the deciles. However, average
compensation across the deciles is close to monotonically increasing, especially in the extreme
deciles where we have the most confidence of our estimates of value added. Ex-post there is
a tight relationship between measured skill and compensation. What about ex-ante — once
managers reveal their skill by adding value, do investors reward them with higher subsequent
compensation? Figure 4 plots out-of-sample compensation and demonstrates that they do.
Not only is compensation increasing in the deciles, but the average 10th decile manager earns
considerably more than managers in the other deciles. Because the average fee does not differ by
much across deciles, by choosing to allocate their capital to skilled managers, it is investors that
determine these compensation differences, confirming a central insight in Berk and Green (2004).
24

Figure 4 illustrates, again, that using the FFC risk adjustment makes a material difference.
Compensation is still increasing in the deciles, but the differences are smaller than when the
Vanguard benchmark is used.
If investors reward better managers with higher compensation, then they must be able to
identify better managers ex ante. Thus, compensation should predict performance. To test this
inference, we repeated the previous sorting procedure, except we use total compensation rather
than the Skill Ratio to sort funds. That is, at the beginning of each time horizon, we use the
product of the current AUM and fee to sort funds into the deciles and then follow the identical
procedure we used before. Figure 5, summarizes the results — current compensation does
predict future performance. When managers are sorted into deciles by their total compensation
the relative difference in performance across the deciles is slightly larger than when the Skill
Ratio is used.
One striking difference between when the sorts are based on compensation rather than the
Skill Ratio (i.e., Figure 5 vs. Figure 2) is the increased monotonicity when the sorts are based
on compensation. To formally document this difference we count the number of times each
decile outperforms the next lowest decile (in terms of value added). Table 8 reports the pvalue of observing the reported numbers under the Null hypothesis that there is no skill (so
the probability is 1/2). The table confirms what the pictures imply. While the Skill Ratio can
identify extreme performers, it does not differentiate the rest of managers very well. In contrast,
investors appear to do a much better job correctly differentiating between managers at all skill
levels. We again see a difference when the FFC factor specification is used to adjust for risk. In
this case investors do not appear to differentiate as well, consistent with the prior evidence that
compensation is not as highly correlated with subsequent performance. Again, the evidence is
consistent with the idea that investors do not seem to care about outperformance relative to the
FFC risk specification.
For many years now researchers have characterized the behavior of investors in the mutual fund sector as suboptimal — dumb investors chasing past returns. This evidence relating
compensation to performance suggests quite the opposite conclusion. Investors appear able to
differentiate good managers from bad, and compensate them accordingly. Notice from Figure 1
that real compensation for the top managers has increased over time — fund size has increased
while fees have remained constant. On the other hand, for median managers real compensation
has remained constant, suggesting that overall increases in compensation, in at least this sector
of the financial services industry, are rewards for skill.

Analyzing Skill

The Vanguard benchmarks are constructed from net returns while the funds’ value added numbers are constructed using gross returns. Because Vanguard index funds provide diversification
services, this means our value-added measure includes both the diversification benefits as well
as other skills and services managers provide. Therefore, if an active manager chooses to do
nothing other than exactly replicate a Vanguard benchmark fund, we would compute a positive
value added for that manager equal to the diversification benefits he provides (i.e., the fees
charged by Vanguard times the size of the fund). So a natural question to ask is what fraction
of value added is compensation for providing diversification and what fraction can be attributed
to other skills.
We answer this question by recomputing value-added using the gross returns (including fees)
of the Vanguard funds as the benchmark and comparing that to our earlier measures. The first
two columns of Table 9 demonstrate that about half the value added is due to diversification
benefits ($70,000 per month) and half ($70,000 per month) is due to other types of skill such
as stock picking and/or market timing. The non-diversification skills are also persistent. As
the bottom panel in Table 9 demonstrates, when funds are sorted on the Skill Ratio computed
using gross returns, the top decile consistently outperforms the bottom decile.16 So the evidence
suggests that active managers provide more than just diversification benefits. Similar results
obtain when we use the ex-post distribution of skill (i.e., equation 9) — slightly less than half
the value added can be attributed to diversification benefits.
An alternative way to estimate how much diversification benefits mutual funds provide is
to calculate the average value added of all the index funds in our database using Vanguard net

Table 9: Performance of Active Funds and Index Funds: The table computes the valueadded, net alpha numbers and the p-value of the persistence order statistic that counts the
number of times the top decile outperforms the bottom decile for the set of active mutual funds,
and compares it the set of index funds (including the Vanguard index funds themselves). To
separate the value added coming from diversification benefits vrs. stock picking/market timing,
we use two different benchmarks: (1) Vanguard index funds gross returns and (2) Vanguard
index funds net returns, labelled “Vanguard Gross” and “Vanguard Net” in the table.

28

returns as the benchmark. The fourth column of Table 9 provides the results of this exercise
— index funds add approximately $30,000/month in diversification benefits. This estimate of
the diversification benefits is lower than before because Vanguard is more efficient at providing
diversification services than the average index fund — when value added of the average index
fund is computed using Vanguard gross returns as the benchmark (third column of the table),
the estimates are negative. This inefficiency is also reflected in the funds’ net alphas — investors
in Vanguard funds get the diversification benefits more cheaply than investors in other index
funds.

8

Sample Selection

Because we do not exclude funds that invest internationally, the set of funds in our study is
considerably larger than the set previously studied in the literature. One may therefore wonder
to what extent the ability to invest in international stocks affects our value added numbers. We
explore this question in Table 10 by forming subsamples of active and index funds based on their
average portfolio weight in international stocks. We find that active funds that invested more in
international stocks added more value. Indeed, funds that restricted themselves to only investing
in U.S. stocks (on average, less than 10% in non-U.S. stocks) added no value on average.
One worry is that our Vanguard benchmark funds do not appropriately define the alternative
investment opportunity set for international stocks, even though we include all the international
index funds that Vanguard offers. If this explanation is right, it implies that index funds that
invest more internationally will add more value. Table 10 shows that this is not the case. We find
that index funds that invested more in international stocks added less value. Therefore, the ex
post selection of active funds that have invested more or less in international funds appears to be
correlated with skill. By excluding mutual funds that invest in international stocks, researchers
may unknowingly introduced a selection bias into their results.

9

Conclusion

In this paper we provide evidence of the existence of rents that can be attributable to managerial
skill. We show that the average mutual fund manager uses his skills to generate value — about
$2 million/year. This value added cannot easily be attributable to luck alone because it is
persistent. Managers sorted on this measure of skill continue to add value, in some cases for as
long as 10 years into the future.
Perhaps our most surprising result is that investors appear to be able to identify and correctly
reward this skill. Not only do better managers earn higher compensation, but compensation
itself is a better predictor of future value added than past value added.

Table 10: Fraction in International Funds and the Performance of Active Funds vs
Index Funds: The table computes value-added numbers for funds with varying degrees of
international stock exposure. We compute the numbers for active as well as passive funds. We
use two different benchmarks: (1) Vanguard index funds net returns and (2) Vanguard index
funds gross returns.
Our results are consistent with the main predictions of Berk and Green (2004). Investors
appear to be able to identify skilled managers and determine their compensation through the
flow–performance relation. That model also assumes that because rational investors compete
in capital markets, the net alpha to investors is zero, that is, managers are able to capture all
economic rents themselves. In this paper we find that the average abnormal return to investors
is close to zero. Further, we find little evidence that investors can generate a positive net alpha
by investing with the best managers.

In this appendix we explain how we construct our set of benchmarks. We show how to evaluate
a fund relative to two benchmarks that exist over different periods of time. The general case
with N benchmark funds is a straightforward generalization and is left to the reader.

Let Rit
denote the gross excess return of active fund i at time t, which is stacked in the

vector Rig :

benchmark fund, which, over the time period in which they both exist, form the matrix RtB :
RtB =

Assume that the first benchmark fund is available to investors over the whole sample period,
while the second benchmark fund is only available over a subset of the sample, say the second
half.

Let β denote the projection coefficient of Rit
on the first benchmark fund’s return, R1t

the time period when only the first benchmark exists, the value added of the fund at time t is:

g
B
Vit = qi,t−1 Rit
− βR1t
.

(18)

When both benchmark funds are offered, the value-added in period t is:

g
Vit = qi,t−1 Rit
− RtB γ .

(19)

Let there be T time periods and suppose that the second benchmark fund starts in period S + 1.

Proposition 1 The value-added of the firm at any time t can be estimated as follows:


g

Vit = qi,t−1 Rit
− ζ 2 X̂2t
− ζ 3 X̂3t

(20)

using a single OLS regression to estimate ζ:

X O0 Rig .
ζ = XO XO
Proof: The second and the third column of X O are orthogonal to each other, both over the full
O = RB , the
sample as well as over the two subsamples. Because of this orthogonility and X2t

regression coefficient ζ 2 is given by:

g

 = β.
ζ2 =

So for any t ≤ S, (20) reduces to (18) and so this estimate of value added is consistent over the
first subsample. Using the orthogonality of X O ,

and using the fact that linear projections are unique implies
ζ 2 = β = γ 1 + θγ 2

ζ 3 = γ2.

Robustness

Table 11 reports the results of conducting our study within different subsamples of our data. We
select the samples based on the time period and whether managers invest internationally. Even
when we consider active funds that invest in U.S. equity only, we always use all 11 Vanguard
index funds at the benchmark.
