A theoretical model based on Long and Plosser (1983) is used to derive a reduced form for sectoral output from first principles.  Cointegration and common features (cycles) tests are performed and sectoral output data seem to share a relatively high number of common trends and a relatively low number of common cycles. A special trend-cycle decomposition of the data set is performed and the results indicate a very similar cyclical behavior across sectors and a very different behavior for trends.  In a variance decomposition exercise, for prominent sectors such as Manufacturing and Wholesale/Retail Trade, the cyclical innovation is more important than the trend innovation.\n\n",
