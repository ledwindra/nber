We are especially interested in whether and how much the degree of heterogeneity in communities influences the amount of participation in different types of groups.  Using survey data on group membership and data on US localities, we find that, after controlling for many individual characteristics, participation in social activities is significantly lower in more unequal and in more racially or ethnically fragmented localities.  We also find that those individuals who express views against racial mixing are less prone to participate in the groups the more racially heterogeneous their community is.\n\n",
