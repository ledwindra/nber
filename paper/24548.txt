Jobs for the Heartland: Place-Based Policies in 21st Century America

ABSTRACT
The economic convergence of American regions has greatly slowed, and rates of long-term nonemployment have even been diverging. Simultaneously, the rate of non-employment for working
age men has nearly tripled over the last 50 years, generating a terrible social problem that is
disproportionately centered in the eastern parts of the American heartland. Should more
permanent economic divisions across space lead American economists to rethink their traditional
skepticism about place-based policies? We document that increases in labor demand appear
to have greater impacts on employment in areas where not working has been historically
high, suggesting that subsidizing employment in such places could particularly reduce the not
working rate. Pro-employment policies, such as a ramped up Earned Income Tax Credit, that are
targeted towards regions with more elastic employment responses, however financed, could
plausibly reduce suffering and materially improve economic performance.

Introduction
Do America’s profound spatial economic disparities require spatially targeted policies?

Traditionally, economists have been skeptical towards these policies because of a conviction that
relief is best targeted towards poor people not poor places, because incomes in poor areas were
converging towards incomes in rich areas anyway, and because of fears that favoring one
location would impoverish another.

This paper argues for reconsidering place-based policies,

because (i) convergence has stalled or reversed in recent decades, (ii) social problems are
increasingly linked to a lack of jobs rather than a lack of income and subsidizing job creation
may be easier at the place level than at the person level, and (iii) a modest body of evidence
suggests that increasing the demand for labor has a materially greater impact on nonemployment in depressed areas.

Place-based policies can take the form of more generous

employment subsidies in depressed areas, which provides implicit insurance against place-based
shocks but distorts migration decisions, or equivalently generous policies that tilt existing
programs to encourage employment in areas with more joblessness.
America’s regions have long displayed enormous economic disparities, but for most of the 20th
century, poorer states were catching up rapidly (Barro and Sala-I-Martin, 1991) and high local
unemployment rates did not persist (Blanchard and Katz, 1992).

Migration flowed to high

income regions, and capital was attracted by low wages in poorer areas. Both flows helped
incomes to converge.
In recent decades, regional income convergence has slowed or even reversed (Berry and
Glaeser, 2005, Moretti, 2011), and place-based non-employment has become durable. Over the
past 40 years, migration has stopped flowing to high-income regions and declined more
generally (Ganong and Shoag, 2017).

Economic division across space loom as the backdrop to

our political divisions (Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Maslesi, 2016).
In Section II of this paper, we document the hardening of America’s geographic divisions, and
the rise of non-employment among the 25-54 year old men who are the focus of this paper.
Many measures of well-being suggest that not working is a far worse outcome than low-income
employment, which motivates our focus on employment rather than income. 1
disparities in joblessness are large.

Regional

The non-employment rate for 25- to 54-year-old men was

over 35 percent in Flint, Michigan in 2016 and 5 percent in Alexandria, Virginia.

1
Eberstadt (2016) and Council of Economic Advisors (2016) both provide excellent overviews of the rise in non-employment among primeaged males.

2

We divide the U.S. into three regions: the prosperous coasts, the western heartland and the
eastern heartland, divided based on year of statehood.

The coasts have high incomes, but the

western heartland also benefits from natural resources and high levels of historical education.
America’s social problems, including non-employment, disability, opioid-related deaths and
rising mortality, are concentrated in America’s eastern heartland, states from Mississippi to
Michigan, generally east of the Mississippi and not on the Atlantic coast.

The income and

employment gaps between the three regions are not converging, but instead seem to be hardening
into semi-permanent examples of economic hysteresis.
The European Union has long embraced place-based policies that target distressed areas, but
U.S. national policy has typically adopted geographic uniformity. Place-based policies are
popular with place-based politicians, but economists often emphasize that a national perspective
pushes towards helping poor people not helping poor places. Section III analyzes the economic
rationales for place-based policies.
An abundant literature documents agglomeration economies and human capital externalities
(Duranton and Puga, 2004, Combes et al., 2008, Moretti, 2011).

While such externalities

suggest market failure, they do not imply any particular spatial policy.

Both New York and

Appalachia might benefit from more economic activity and more skilled residents, but we do not
know if it is optimal to shift skills and density from New York to Appalachia or vice versa.
A second justification for place-based policies is to insure residents against place-based
economic shocks, just as the Federal government already provides some insurance against placebased natural disasters. In 1969, Detroit residents had higher incomes than Boston residents, but
today Boston residents are 40 percent wealthier. 2 But smoothing income differences across state
would only modestly reduce income inequality. Controlling for states explains only 1.2 percent
of the variation in income levels; even the smaller Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) can
explain only 7.1 percent of the variation in income.

Smoothing income differences across

smaller geographic areas would distort migration, raise housing costs in low-income areas and
potentially even concentrate poverty.
The most compelling case for place-based policy is that one-size-fits-all interventions are
woefully inappropriate for regional economies as diverse as Appalachia and Silicon Valley.
Subsidizing employment, either at the individual or firm level, makes little sense in an economy

2
Place of birth strongly impacts economic opportunity (Chetty and Hendren, 2016). Almost 50 years ago, in 1969, the Census also lists
Stamford, CT as the wealthiest metropolitan area and McAllen, TX, as the poorest metropolitan. In that year, Stamford was almost three times
as rich as McAllen. In 2016, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, America’s richest metropolitan areas (Stamford, CT, and Midland,
TX) are four times richer than the poorest metropolitan area in the U.S. (McAllen, TX).

as robust as greater San Francisco, where restricted housing supply limits future population
growth. If non-employment is much more sensitive to subsidy in West Virginia, then larger proemployment subsidies in that state seem likely to reduce suffering more.
Place-based policies need not mean large-scale transfers to distressed areas, but instead the
tailoring of policies to particular locales. For example, a bevy of current social welfare policies,
including Section 8 Housing Vouchers, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program
(SNAP), and Disability Insurance, currently tax earnings implicitly.

The implicit taxes on

housing vouchers and food stamps could be reduced for low income workers from 30 percent to
20 percent in areas where employment is particularly responsive to the returns to working.
Indeed, even the most diehard opponent of place-based redistribution should see the logic of
tailoring Federal policies to local labor market conditions. Standard social policy rules, like the
Baily (1976)—Chetty (2006) formula for unemployment insurance, depend on parameters that
differ across space. If non-employment is particularly harmful in one location and particularly
sensitive to public policies, then that diehard could still support a place-based revenue-neutral
twist that reallocates funds from benefits that discourage working to benefits that encourage
employment in that area, without encouraging migration or raising housing prices.
We use a modified Baily-Chetty formula to analyze benefits for the not working and for
marginal workers.

The formula depends on two parameters: the ratio of the externalities

associated with non-employment to the wage of low-income workers, and the heterogeneous
response of employment rates to policy interventions.

In Section IV, we look for heterogeneous

responses by testing whether exogenous shocks reduce non-employment more in high nonemployment states.
We first use industrial composition “Bartik” shocks. These shocks do reduce not working
rates more in states where the average not working rate is higher. China trade shocks, as
identified Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013), also impact not working rates more in commuting
zones with higher historic levels of non-employment.

Military spending shocks, used by

Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), also have a larger impact on not working rates in states where
the average not working rate is higher, but the difference is statistically insignificant.

Our

results are far from definitive, but they do support the perfectly unsurprising view that you can
reduce non-employment more in places where non-employment is currently high. We hope that
future work will do more to examine spatial heterogeneity in labor supply elasticities, and the
regional heterogeneity of labor markets more broadly.

4

Section V follows Gordon (1973) and focuses on the externalities of non-employment, which
includes fiscal costs to the state, costs born by friends and family, and possibly also spillovers
that encourage more non-employment (Topa, 2001).

We calibrate these costs to range from .22

to .38 times the typical wages earned by low-income workers, but recognize that these numbers
are quite debatable.

Using these estimates Section VI calibrates our model, which suggests

that the generosity of pro-employment programs relative to non-employment benefits should be
higher in West Virginia than in Nebraska. The modified Baily-Chetty formula also implies that
subsidies should skew more towards employment in high employment elasticity regions when
the coefficient of relative risk aversion is low.
Section VII turns to a taxonomy of place-based policies, and discusses their costs as well as
benefits, including distorted mobility, 3 capitalization, and other deadweight losses.
Empowerment zones subsidize employment in high poverty areas, and Busso, Gregory and Kline
(2013) find them effective. 4 Attempts to use infrastructure to help depressed cities, such as
Detroit’s People Mover Monorail, have had far less encouraging results. But infrastructure, like
the Tennessee Valley Authority, that actually delivers a scarce and enormously valuable
resource, such as electricity, can have large economic effects (Kline and Moretti, 2013).
Conversely, the Appalachian Regional Commission, which provide a potpourri of placed-based
support including highways, seems to have done little to change the region’s fortunes.
We end with a discussion of plausible policies that might respond to spatially heterogeneous
employment responses to policy. We discuss strengthening employment subsidies, either to the
firm or to the worker, in high non-employment states.

The employment effects of paying

subsidies to the firm, rather than the worker, will be stronger if workers’ wages face a lower
minimum wage bound.

We discuss tilting the incentives that community colleges face to

provide job counseling and employment-appropriate vocational skills.

A wide literature

suggests that education combats joblessness at both the individual and region level, and investing
in education is a natural complement to subsidizing employment. Finally, we mention policies
that might have benign spatial effects even if they are apparently neutral. A flat per dollar
employment subsidy would presumably have a larger effect in low cost states where prices are
lower.

3

The impact of spatially heterogeneous policies on migration is a long-standing question in anti-poverty policy, and much of the best work on
this topic preceded welfare reform, when state differences in AFDC payments could be quite large (Borjas and Hilton, 1996).
4
Busso, Gregory and Kline (2013) also find Empowerment Zones do seem to get capitalized into housing prices, especially in depressed areas,
but evidence for capitalization into rents is weaker.

II.

The Geography of Jobless America
A belief in individual upward mobility reduces the desire for income redistribution (Alesina,
Morales and Stantcheva, 2016). Similarly, a belief in the upward mobility of regions limits the
demand for place-based policies. America has long tolerated dramatic economic differences
across space, partially because people regularly moved from poor places to rich places and
capital flowed freely from high wage areas to low wage areas. In this section, we document five
trends that suggest that this mobility has fallen considerably and that America appears to be
evolving into durable islands of wealth and poverty. At the broadest level, the nation can be

divided into its wealthy, costly coasts, a reasonably successful Western Heartland and a painfully
jobless Eastern Heartland. These differences are driven mainly by historic differences in human
capital and the economic dislocation caused by deindustrialization.

The Closing of the Metropolitan Frontier
America has long been a nation with enormous spatial differences in income. In 1950,
America had 18 states with per capita earnings that doubled the per capita earnings in
Mississippi. In 2016, Mississippi is still America’s poorest state, but there is no state with double
its per capita income. Many of Mississippi’s poorest residents went north to the factories of
Chicago and Detroit (Smith and Welch, 1989). Industry flowed south, encouraged by probusiness policies, like Right-To-Work laws (Holmes, 1998). America’s western frontier may
have closed at the end of the 19th century, but there was still a metropolitan frontier where
workers from depressed areas could find a more prosperous future.
Five facts collectively suggest that this geographic escape valve has tightened: declining
geographic mobility, increasingly inelastic housing supplies in high income areas, declining
income convergence, increased sorting by skill across space, and persistent pockets of nonemployment. Together these facts suggest that even if income differences across space have
declined, the remaining economic differences may be a greater source of concern. Consequently,
it may be time to target pro-employment policies towards our most distressed areas.
Figure 1 shows that between 1950 and 1992, inter-county mobility never dropped below six
percent. Since 2007, the share of American residents who moved across counties has never
exceeded 3.9 percent. The first steep drop occurred between 1990 and 1995, and then another dip
occurred after 2005. This decline in cross-county mobility is mirrored by the drop in the within
county mobility rate which fell from over 13 percent in the 1950s to under seven percent.

6

Declining mobility appears among both renters and owners; the change is not merely underwater borrowers held in place by their mortgages.
[Figure 1]
The great wave of post-war mobility included the Great Migration of African-Americans
north, the nationwide move to the sunbelt, and massive suburbanization. In these previous
migrations, as had been true throughout almost all of American history, housing was supplied
abundantly to meet migrants’ demand. Suburbanization itself can be seen as a massive shock to
housing supply, generated by cars and highways (Baum-Snow, 2007), that enabled the AfricanAmericans coming north to occupy urban apartments (Boustan and Margo, 2013). The growth of
the sunbelt reflects a combination of economic resurgence, the taste for warm weather, and few
restrictions on the mass production of housing (Glaeser and Tobio, 2007).
Moreover, the African-American migrants to the north had little to lose by departing the Jim
Crow South. As Schleicher (2017) emphasizes, poorer Americans today are held in place by
public benefits, such as housing vouchers, which can be difficult to carry across state or even
county lines. Ostensibly Federal programs, such as Medicaid and Temporary Aid to Needy
Families (TANF), are administered at the state level. A move across states will require a new
application that may not succeed.
Migration has both declined and become less directed towards high-income areas (Ganong
and Shaog, 2017). The unskilled flooded into the high-income areas between 1940 and 1960,
presumably bringing wages down, but they did not between 1980 and 2010. Dao, Furceri, and
Loungani (2017) show that interstate migration due to labor market shocks has declined since the
1990s. Zabeck (2018) shows that stronger local ties to a region lead to lower migration rates in
response to labor market shocks.
Low income workers still receive significant wage gains from migrating to high income areas,
but the housing-related costs of moving to those areas has grown. Housing costs within skilled
cities have risen particularly dramatically (Glaeser and Saiz, 2004). Between 1977 and 2017,
real housing prices in Detroit were flat according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency repeat
sales index, while real housing prices in Boston increased by 165 percent and real housing prices
in San Francisco increased by 285 percent.

Many authors associate higher housing prices with

7

stringent land use regulations, especially in better-educated communities (Gyourko, Saiz and
Summers, 2008, Glaeser and Ward, 2009). 5
Throughout most of American history, economic productivity was accompanied by near
elastic housing supply. The settlers who moved to richer, western agricultural land in the 19th
century built their own inexpensive balloon-frame homes. The farmers and immigrants who
came to Chicago in the 19th century readily piled into overcrowded tenements. New York City
built over 100,000 units annually in the early 1920s when the city experienced its post-World
War I boom. Silicon Valley has exploded as an engine of American innovation, but it is
practically synonymous with stringent land use restrictions, including some areas with 60-acre
minimum lot sizes. Hsieh and Moretti (2017) estimate that these restrictions have led to a
misallocation of labor that has significantly reduced America’s overall G.D.P.
An additional barrier to interstate migration has been the rise of occupational licensing laws,
which restrict the movement of workers across state lines. Johnson and Kleiner (2017) find that
individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing requirements have a 36 percent lower rate
of interstate migration than comparable workers in other occupations.
The skilled do still move towards higher skill, higher wages areas, helping to ensure that
skilled areas are become more skilled over time. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where we see that
prime male migrants are significantly better educated than the non-migrant population in the
PUMA that they left.
[Figure 2]
Berry and Glaeser (2005) report a robust correlation between the change in the percent of the
population with a college degree and the initial share of the population with a college degree in
the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s across metropolitan areas. The increasing segregation of the skilled
matters because the skill level of a locality is strongly correlated both with the levels of earnings
for non-skilled workers (Moretti, 2004), and with longer-term growth of incomes and population
(Glaeser and Saiz, 2004).
Increased geographic sorting by skill probably reflects a combination of restrictions that
stymie the construction of affordable housing and workplace complementarities between

5

One plausible explanation for the relationship between regulation and education is that more skilled people are also better at organizing into
groups that oppose new construction, such as Greater San Francisco’s Save the Bay Association (co-founded by the wife of Berkeley’s Chancellor
Clark Kerr).

8

educated employees. 6 The innovations generated by highly skilled workers today appear to
increasingly demand the labor of skilled workers rather than unskilled workers. Henry Ford’s
automated assembly lines depended on tens of thousands of less skilled workers, and hence his
skills strongly complemented less skilled labor. Bill Gates’ innovations primarily employed
highly skilled software programmers.
Declining in-migration to high wage areas has been accompanied by a decline in the
convergence of incomes across states and metropolitan areas. Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1991)
document the striking convergence in per capita income levels across U.S. states between 1880
and 1980. This convergence is the backdrop for the shrinking gap between incomes in
Mississippi and the rest of the U.S. Berry and Glaeser (2005) show that by the 1990s, changes in
metropolitan area incomes were no longer negatively correlated with initial per capita incomes.
Ganong and Shoag (2017) find that the relationship between state-level changes in per capital
and initial per capita income was much weaker from 1990 to 2010 than from 1940 to 1960.
[Figure 3]
Figure 3 shows the convergence of log median incomes across 542 Public Use Microdata
Areas (PUMA) between 1980 and 2010 for prime men. The coefficient is -0.16, which is far less
than the -2.4 coefficient that Ganong and Shoag (2017) report for states between 1940 and 1960.
Even that modest income convergence may be a spurious reflection of measurement error in the
1980 variable. When we instrument for log median income with the logarithm of the 10th percent
and the 90th percentile income in 1980 (the r-squared of the first stage regression is .85), we
estimate

Standard errors are in parentheses. It seems plausible that true income convergence has
disappeared at the PUMA level as well.

The Rise of Joblessness among Men
The growth of geographic barriers within the U.S. has coincided with the dramatic increase in
not working rates among prime aged men within the U.S., which primarily reflects men leaving

6

Berry and Glaeser (2006) find that the correlation across industries between the education levels of managers and the education level of
workers increased significantly between 1970 and 2000, which supports the view that skilled workers increasingly complement each other at
work.

9

the labor force.

The share of prime aged males who are not in the labor force has grown from

under four percent during the 1950s to over ten percent today. 7
Throughout this paper, we focus on the total rate of not working among prime aged men,
defined as men aged 25 to 54, rather than unemployment or labor force participation. We define
the non-employment rate (or not working rate) as the share of men who are not currently
employed, or one minus the employment to population rate for prime men. We take the view that
the distinction between unemployment and labor force participation – does the person say that
they want a job – is relatively arbitrary since almost all of the not working would presumably
work if the price was right. 8

In many cases, those who are not now looking for a job will

nevertheless return to employment in a short period of time.
When we examine prime men whose monthly Current Population Survey responses can be
linked for all eight months, we find that 67 percent of men who left and re-entered employment
during the 16-month CPS window recorded at least one month that they were not in the labor
force. 9 Coglianese (2017) refers to these men who leave and re-enter the workforce as ‘in-andouts’, and we believe it is important to distinguish these men who are temporarily absent from
the labor force from the long-term not working. In addition, the expanding role of disability
insurance relative to unemployment insurance (Autor and Duggan, 2003) may mean that an
increasing share of individuals who would once have classified themselves as unemployed now
list themselves as out of the labor force.
Blanchard and Katz (1992) showed a practically non-existent relationship between the
unemployment rate in 1975 and the unemployment rate in 1985 across states. That nonrelationship supported the idea that geographic differences in the not working rate are a
temporary phenomenon rapidly undone through migration and cyclical shocks. Figure 4 shows
the relationship between the male not working rate in 2010 and the male not working rate in
1980 across PUMAs. The correlation between the two rates is 0.79. Moreover, the relationship
shows diverging not working rates because the coefficient on the 1980 not working rate is 1.08,
which means that the growth in the not working rate is positively associated with the initial not
working rate.
[Figure 4]

Appendix Figure 1. Appendix Figure 2 shows a steady rise in female labor force participation through the 1990s and then a leveling off.
See Clark and Summers (1979).

9

The CPS consists of a 4-8-4 rotation structure, where households are interviewed for four months, rotate out of the panel for eight months,
and are then interviewed for an additional four months. We use the method developed by Drew, Flood and Warren (2014) to match respondents
across months.

10

Figure 5 shows the time series of not working men split into three categories: unemployed (not
employed and actively seeking work), not in the labor force but wanting a job, and not in the
labor force and not wanting a job. 10 The share of prime-age males who are not in the labor force
and do not want a job shows a steady upward trend. The share that is unemployed undulates,
severely peaking at almost ten percent during the Great Recession. The third category, not in the
labor force but still wanting a job, has held steady at slightly less than two percent.
[Figure 5]
We prefer to focus on the distinction between long-term and short-term non-employed, where
long-term non-employed is more associated with leaving the labor force and short-term nonemployed is more typically associated with unemployment. Figure 6 includes both the total not
working rate and the share of men who been without a job for over a year, using data form the
Annual Social and Economic Supplement Survey (previously known as the March Current
Population Survey).
[Figure 6]

The Misery of Joblessness
We focus on joblessness among prime aged men, rather than income inequality, because we
see it as a far greater problem. There is significant correlational evidence suggesting that misery
haunts the lives of the long-term not working. The next figure show life satisfaction levels by
work status next using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
[Figure 7]
In the figure, we compare the employed earning over $50,000 per year, the employed earning
$35,000 to $50,000 per year, the employed earning less than $35,000 per year, and the not
working, and show the share of the male population in each group that reports a low level of life
satisfaction. This number is quite low among those earning more than $35,000 per year. Low
life satisfaction rises for those who are employed but earning less than $35,000 per year, but low

10
We note that some men who state they want a job may be unable to start a job immediately. However, we believe it is instructive to
decompose not working men into those who have a stated preference for future employment and those who do not.

11

life satisfaction is much higher among those who are not employed. Almost 20 percent of the not
working in the eastern heartland report a low level of life satisfaction.
Clark and Oswald (1994) also report that unemployment has a much more negative impact on
happiness than low earnings. Hajek (2013) estimate the relationship between unemployment and
unhappiness with individual fixed effects and finds a significant negative effect, especially if the
unemployment is described as involuntary. Winkelmann (2014) similarly finds the happiness
drops significantly after an individual becomes unemployed.
Happiness is not equivalent to utility. Parents of young children, for example, are typically less
happy, but they are presumably compensated in other ways. 11 Yet it is hard to see what benefit is
offsetting unhappiness among the not working.
Non-employment is also strongly correlated with mental health problems. A large literature,
surveyed by Platt (1984), also connects suicide and unemployment. More recent studies include
Kposowa (2001) and Blakely et al. (2003). Over 30 percent of the not working report having
more than ten days of not good mental in the past month. Once again, the gap between not
working and poor but employed is much larger than the gap between poor and rich employed
workers.
Opioid use is another market of pain associated with non-employment, as highlighted by
Krueger (forthcoming). Like suicide, opioid use may be another consequence of nonemployment. Since opioids can also lead to addiction and death, they also are an added cause of
social pain.

The Geography of Joblessness
We now turn to the geography of joblessness in the U.S. We begin with two maps of the
United States. The two maps show the geography of prime-aged male non-employment in the
U.S. in 1980 and 2015. Data comes from the Census and we use consistent Public Use Microdata
Areas (PUMAs). The 2015 data is based on three years of the American Community Survey
(2014 to 2016). 12
The 1980 map shows that fewer than ten percent of men were not employed in 1980 in much
of the western U.S. and in the Northeastern corridor. Coastal California and much of the
Midwest and Southeast had non-employment rates between ten and 15 percent. Rates over 15
11
The residents of rust belt cities were less happy during the 1940s and 1970s, but they were presumably compensated by higher wages
(Glaeser, Gottlieb and Ziv, 2014).
12
There are slight population differences between decennial Census data, used to create the 1980 map, and American Community Survey
data, used to create the 2015 maps. Moreover, the 2015 PUMAs are defined differently than the consistent PUMAs used from 1980 to 2010.
Maps look broadly similar using 2010 data and consistent 1980-2010 PUMAs.

percent were only seen in Appalachia, and a few isolated parts of lower density America,
including a PUMA in Arizona, upstate New York, and a few parts of California.
[Figure 8]
The 2015 map shows the non-employment rate has risen almost everywhere, but the Northeast
Corridor and much of the western U.S. still remain relatively more employed. Non-employment
is high in the far west, except for the areas around Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle and in
a great swath of middle America that runs from Louisiana up to Michigan. Appalachia remains a
place of tremendous economic dysfunction.
[Figure 9]
Women are more likely to work in northern areas, whether in the east or the west, and less
likely to work in southern areas.

rates on the change in prime-aged female not working rates at the PUMA level between 19802010, we find the R2 is only 0.094. These differences seem as likely to be driven by cultural
norms as by economic distress. The shifts in male and female employment are not particularly
correlated with one another, meaning that the declining male employment rates reflect economic
distress that does not seem to be offset by increases in female labor force participation.
Figure 10 looks at long-term (over 12 month) not working rate, and shows there is also strong
divergence since 1980. For every extra percentage point of men who were long-term not working
in 1980 (the first year we can calculate this number), the growth in long-term not working
increases by 0.82 percentage points between 1980 and 2014. 14 Hall (1972) documented that
unemployment was slightly higher in higher wage cities, suggesting that workers were being
compensated for a greater risk of being unemployed, but today the relationship between nonemployment and income is strongly negative.
[Figure 10]
These previous maps inspire our division of American into three groups: the coastal states, the
eastern heartland and the western heartland. The PUMA maps suggest that many states could be

usefully divided. Inland California looks quite different from the San Francisco Bay. Yet many
data sources contain only state identifiers, so we will use state boundaries. We refer to those
states that were formed prior to 1840 as the eastern heartland and those states that were
constituted after 1840 as the western heartland. 15
The coastal states have seen their real economies grow by 330 percent over the past 40 years.
The western heartland has grown by 461 percent over the same period. The eastern heartland has
experienced the most sluggish growth: 181 percent. 16
The parallel growth in G.D.P. between the coasts and the western heartland can be divided into
growth in G.D.P. per worker and growth in the number of workers. While per capita G.D.P.
growth was faster in the coasts, employment growth has been far faster in the western heartland.
The difference may reflect far more elastic housing supply in the western heartland that
welcomes workers in response to rising productivity.
The trends in GDP are matched by the trends in the not working rate. Figure 11 shows the
prime-aged male not working rate since the late 1970s. Before the recession of the early 1980s,
non-employment was roughly comparable in the coasts and the eastern heartland. The western
heartland had the lowest levels of not working. Since the year 2000, the ordering has been stable.
The not working rate has been highest in the eastern heartland and lowest in the western
heartland. The coasts are in between.
[Figure 11]
Figure 12 shows the mortality rates between the three regions for prime-aged males. Between
the late 1960s and the early 1980s, mortality fell smoothly for all three regions and the ordering
was stable. The western heartland was the healthiest region of the country. During the early
1980s, male mortality rose in the coasts, partially reflecting the scourge of AIDS. Since the
1990s, the eastern heartland has been the outlier with relatively high, and even occasionally
rising levels of mortality for prime-aged males. If we seek to understand the striking fact of
rising prime-aged male mortality, noted by Case and Deaton (2015), we look in the Eastern
Heartland.

These are

particularly high in the low employment areas of the eastern heartland.
[Figure 13]
A final social problem is imprisonment, which impacts a significant share of the male
population in many states. 17

Until the mid-1990s, imprisonment rates were generally higher in

the coasts than in the western heartland. Between the mid-1990s and 2010, the western heartland
had the highest imprisonment rate. Now, both heartlands have imprisonment rates that are
dramatically higher than the imprisonment rate on the coast.

Why Does the Non-Employment Rate Vary across America?
Abraham and Kearney (2018) credit labor demand side factors (competition with China and
robots) with one-third of the decline of the male employment rate since 1999.

Supply-side

factors account for less than one-tenth of the change in their analysis, but much of the overall
trended remains unexplained. At the national level, since 1999 wages at the bottom of the labor
market (10th percentile) have been higher than they were in the 1970s, so it would seem that the
rising rate of non-employment must at least partially reflect shifting labor supply. 18 While
perhaps not all of those not working could get an $8.90 per hour job in 1999, many surely could
and chose not to work for such low earnings.

Aguiar, Bils, Charles and Hurst (2017) suggest

that labor supply has shifted because of better entertainment options, but the willingness to work
at low wages may have also fallen because of a more generous public and private (e.g. working
spouses) safety net or changing preferences.
Yet non-employment is a lower tail phenomenon which may be more sensitive to the variance
than to the mean of wage across space. If two separate regional experience markets that
experience a mean preserving wage spread, then non-employment in the low wage market may
rise dramatically while non-employment in the high wage area starts low and stays low. Even if
the aggregate pattern shows constant wages and rising non-employment, which is most
compatible with a labor supply shift, regional patterns may be more compatible with shifting
labor demand.
Figure 14 shows the -0.11 correlation between changes in log median income at the PUMA
level and changes in the male non-employment rate.
17

Moreover, many of the PUMAs with

Appendix Figure 28 and 29 shows the increase in incarceration rates.
Although real hourly wages for the 10th percentile of the U.S. male income distribution were lower in the 1980s and 1990s than they had
been in 1979, by 1999, hourly real wages had recovered.
18

15

sharply rising non-employment rates have experienced declining wages as well. Together, these
facts suggest that labor demand shocks are playing a significant role in explaining the geography
of joblessness.
[Figure 14]
What determines the spatial heterogeneity in labor demand? De-industrialization has been a
particularly adverse shock for less skilled men, but that has been somewhat ameliorated in high
skilled areas, like Seattle, by reinvention around knowledge-intensive industries.

Consequently,

Table 1 tests whether area-level education and industrial history can explain the heterogeneity in
joblessness. In the first regression, we find that 33 percent of the variation in male nonemployment rates across PUMAs in 2010 can be explained by two education variables: the share
of the men without a high school degree and the share of men with a college degree. 19 This effect
combines both the direct impact of education and any of the human capital externalities,
identified by Rauch (1993) and Moretti (2004).
In the second regression, we include the share of male workers in the PUMA in durable and
non-durable manufacturing in 1980 and the r-squared rises to 0.41. 20 A history in durable
manufacturing, which was particularly prevalent in the Eastern Heartland, predicts more nonemployment today. 21 A history in nondurable manufacturing, which was more prevalent in the
Western Heartland and the Southeast, predicts less non-employment. The third regression shows
the impact of adding two regional variables, which raise the r-squared to 0.48: January and July
temperatures. Higher January temperatures are associated with more non-employment, while
higher July temperature are associated with less non-employment.
[Table 1]
The next three regressions show the impact of the same variables on median incomes. Almost
universally, the same variables that are associated with higher median incomes are also
associated with lower not working rates. The one prominent exception is durable goods
manufacturing, which is associated with higher non-employment rates and higher wages. One
interpretation of this fact is the durable manufacturing industries developed the largest gap
between wages paid to incumbent workers and the reservation wages of not working outsiders.

19

Appendix Figures 22 and 23 show the evolution of these variables over time.
Appendix Figure 17 shows the share of manufacturing across the U.S.

As Goldin and Katz (2009) document, industrial areas saw less reason to invest in education.

Can state policies explain the differences in non-employment across America? In Table 2, we
connect joblessness with three different state-level policy measures: corruption convictions,
right-to-work laws (following Holmes, 1998), and occupational licensing laws (which may
capture local opposition to entrepreneurship). 22 We do not use instruments and we are well
aware that few of our variables are truly exogenous.

These regressions use individual level

data, with errors clustered at the state and year level.
[Table 2]
The first column shows the raw not working rates between the three regions, controlling for
nothing else. In the second regression, we control for individual education and area education,
which completely wipes out the not working gap between the eastern heartland and the coasts,
but makes the gap between the western heartland and the coasts larger.
In the third regression, we control also for three state variables: corruption convictions, rightto-work laws, and the share of the population that has an occupation license. Only occupational
licensing has a significant positive effect on the not working rate, and this variable also does
little to explain the western heartland.
The final three regressions repeat this analysis for 1980, 1990 and 2000. With historical
perspective, the western heartland gap looks unusually large. In 2000, both the eastern and the
western heartland have lower not working rates than the coasts, when we control for these
characteristics. In 1980 and 1990, the regional differences look pretty small.
Individual and area education have persistent and strong negative effects on not working.
From 1980 to 2000, the not working rate was lower in right-to-work states. Corruption was
positively associated with not working rate in 1990 and 2000. Occupational licensing has been
positively associated with the not working rate in every year.
The strong correlation between joblessness and education support the common view that
improved schooling is one way to address underperforming primary, secondary and postsecondary schools in the American heartland. Community colleges are particularly natural
institutions for delivering employment-related skills; early childhood programs have been found
to be particularly effective. We now discuss place-based, employment-oriented policies, which
we see as a complement with, not a substitute for, educational reform. 23

22

Heterogeneity in these variables across states are shown in Appendix Figures 30, 31 and 32.
23
Adult retraining for the displaced and non-employed would also seem to be highly desirable, but the literature on such problems is
decidedly mixed.

III.

The Economic Rationales for Place-Based Policies
Standard locational externalities, including agglomeration economies and human capital

externalities, imply that a decentralized spatial equilibrium may not be a Pareto optimum, but the
large empirical literatures on such spatial spillovers provide little guidance about where these
externalities are likely to be larger.

Place-based policies can also insure against place-based

shocks. Places may be useful tags for redistribution, which enable policy-makers to rely less on
effort-distorting income-based redistribution. The largest weakness of equity and insurance
justifications for place-based policy is that relatively little income variation occurs across, rather
than within, states. Focusing on small geographies improves targeting, but also increases the
downsides of place-based redistribution: capitalization of the benefits into housing costs and
distorted migration.
The best case for place-based policies exists when spending in some areas generates a much
bigger behavioral response than in other areas. If the supply of workers into the labor force is
more elastic in some areas than in others, devoting more federal resources to that area will do
more to reduce the not working rate. When employment responses differ across space, welfare
gains can be achieved, even without extra transfers to that area, by redirecting existing Federal
transfers. For example, re-allocating Medicaid spending to employment subsidies may be
welfare improving in areas with a higher employment response to the effective wage.

The Efficiency Rationale for Place-Based Redistribution
The existence of agglomeration economies and congestion externalities mean that local areas
may have too many or too few people. To see this point, assume that there are only two regions
in the economy, and assume that region 1 as the wealthier region. 24 A total homogenous national
labor force (𝑁𝑁𝑇𝑇 ) is divided into the population of the two locales (𝑁𝑁𝑗𝑗 for j=1, 2).

Welfare in

each region is a function of the population size (denoted 𝑈𝑈𝑗𝑗 (𝑁𝑁𝑗𝑗 )).

A spatial equilibrium requires that utility levels are equalized between the two regions, so

𝑈𝑈1 (𝑁𝑁1 ) = 𝑈𝑈2 (𝑁𝑁2 ). A social welfare planner who chose populations to maximize aggregated

welfare (𝑁𝑁1 𝑈𝑈1 (𝑁𝑁1 ) + 𝑁𝑁2 𝑈𝑈2 (𝑁𝑁2 )) would set 𝑈𝑈1 (𝑁𝑁1 ) = 𝑈𝑈2 (𝑁𝑁2 ) + 𝑁𝑁2 𝑈𝑈 ′ 2 (𝑁𝑁2 ) − 𝑁𝑁1 𝑈𝑈 ′1 (𝑁𝑁1 ). The
extra terms (𝑁𝑁2 𝑈𝑈 ′ 2 (𝑁𝑁2 ) − 𝑁𝑁1 𝑈𝑈 ′1 (𝑁𝑁1 )) imply that the spatial equilibrium may not be a social

optimum. Yet the fact that the competitive equilibrium is not a social optimum does not justify

24

We include a somewhat richer model in the online Appendix.

18

targeted regional policies, if we don’t know the direction of the problem.

When we discuss the

empirical work on agglomeration later, we will conclude that we live little confidence in our
estimates of heterogeneity in agglomeration effects. Hence agglomeration-based interventions
seem as likely to harm as to help.

The Insurance and Equity Rationale for Place-Based Redistribution
The simplest equity-based justification for place-based policies is that a concave social welfare
function implies benefits from insuring against local shocks, or even redistributing from higher
income areas to low-income areas. Redistribution based on local income differences is less
justifiable when higher income levels in some areas are offset by higher housing prices. A more
straightforward argument for place-based redistribution is that it provides insurance against
place-based shocks, without distorting labor supply or work effort. 25
The strongest argument against place-based redistribution is that the correlation between place
and income is relatively weak in the United States. In a regression where income is regressed on
region dummies corresponding to our heartland definitions, those region dummies explain only
0.3 percent of the variation in income. When income is regressed on state dummies, those
indicator variables explain only 1.2 percent of the variation. When income is regressed on Public
Use Microdata Area (PUMA) dummies, those dummy variables explain 7.1 percent of the
variation.
How big could the welfare gains be from spatial insurance across states and regions?

To

consider this question quantitatively, we assume that individuals just consume their income and
that welfare is

𝑦𝑦 1−𝛾𝛾
1−𝛾𝛾

and we will focus on the case where 𝛾𝛾 > 1. If income is log-normally

distributed, then expected welfare is equivalent to 𝐸𝐸(𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(𝑦𝑦)) − (γ − 1)Var(ln(𝑦𝑦)). 26

In our data, the mean of log of income for men is 10.53. The standard deviation of income

within states is 1.11. The standard deviation of income across states is 0.12.

Consequently,

eliminating the variation of income across states is equivalent to increasing the log of income by
(γ − 1) times 0.12. If the coefficient of relative risk aversion (γ) is less than 3, this is equivalent

to at best raising the average expected log earning by 0.24. If we treated income taxes as risk

25
Albouy (2010) makes a related point by emphasizing how standard progressive income taxation, without an explicit spatial dimension,
distorts spatial decisions. Income taxes induce people to choose amenities and low housing costs rather than high incomes, although the
distortionary impact of the income tax is diminished by the home mortgage interest deduction.

We can rewrite this as

sharing, which reduced earnings by t and refunded t times mean earnings to everyone, then the
benefit of spatial risk sharing would fall further.
The benefit of eliminating spatial income variation would represent a real welfare gain, but it
would also distort migration and capitalization. 27 The tighter the geographic targeting, the larger
the share of inequality that can be eliminated. Tighter geographic targeting will also ramp up the
impacts on migration and capitalization. Those distortions could be reduced if payments were
based on place of birth, not place of current residence, but it is hard to imagine a birthplace based
national policy. The economic case for place-based insurance is theoretically strong, but in
practice, the possible impact of such a policy seems limited and likely to create pernicious sideeffects.

Differential Response Elasticities and Hot Spots Policing
We now turn to the third, and we think the best, rationale for spatial policy: market failures
that can most plausibly be addressed at the local level. Police departments that use hot spots
policing target resources towards areas where there is more crime, presumably because the
impact of policing resources on crime is higher in those areas. The strategy seems be effective on
both targeted areas and neighboring areas, suggesting that crime isn’t merely displaced to
different areas (Braga et al., 2014). We now turn to a model for place-based that captures the
same economic logic that resources can reduce the not working rate more when targeted towards
areas with higher not working rates.
We focus on public transfers to a population of less skilled workers, who are on the margin of
working. We assume that America is divided in P regions, and marginal workers’ wages equal
𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝 in region p. We assume that these workers never pay taxes, and that the social planner
chooses lump-sum transfers conditional upon working (denoted 𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝 ) and not working (denoted

𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝 ). The monetized private benefit of not-working in place p equals 𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 .

Wages and other

benefits are independent on the public transfers, and we ignore mobility and housing markets
here. 28
Individual i’s welfare is 𝑉𝑉(𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸) − 𝐼𝐼𝑤𝑤 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 , where 𝐼𝐼𝑤𝑤 is an indicator function that takes on a

value of one if the individual works, and 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 is an idiosyncratic cost of working, where the share

Distorting migration can itself be part of the benefit for residents of poorer areas, if out-migration reduces employment for the remaining
residents, as in Greenwood and Hunt (1984).

Some of these concerns are remedied in an online appendix.

of the population in place p, that has value of 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 less than 𝑐𝑐̂𝑖𝑖 is denoted 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝 (𝑐𝑐̂𝑖𝑖 ). Individuals will
therefore work if and only if 𝑉𝑉�𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝 + 𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝 � − 𝑉𝑉�𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 + 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝 � ≥ 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 , and we denote

𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝∗ = 𝑉𝑉�𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝 + 𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝 � − 𝑉𝑉�𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 + 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝 �.

We first assume that the population level of each area is

fixed.

The social welfare planner maximizes expected welfare across the population less the share of
the population that is not working times a constant k, which captures any non-fiscal externalities
from non-employment. The government’s cost of funds equals 𝜗𝜗, which can be interpreted as the
Lagrange multiplier on the government’s overall budget constraint.
𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝 are chosen to maximize:

For Proposition 1, we assume that V(.) is sufficiently concave to ensure that second order
conditions hold.
Proposition 1: If V”(.) is sufficiently large in absolute value and 𝑓𝑓′𝑝𝑝 �𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝∗ � is sufficiently small,
then both benefit levels are decreasing in both wp and dp ; an increase in k causes ep to rise and

bp to fall.

This proposition contains the core insurance motive for redistributing across space. Areas
with lower wages should optimally receive both more benefits and more employment subsidy.
The marginal utility of consumption for the working poor is higher in low wage areas and that
raises the optimal employment subsidy. When the employment subsidy increases, it reduces the
fiscal externality associated with non-employment and consequently increases the optimal
payment to those who do not work.
The first order can also create a variant of the Baily (1976)- Chetty (2006) formula relating
the marginal utility of consumption in for the employed and the jobless:

, the elasticity of the employment rate with respect to the wage, and

reflects the size of the fiscal and non-fiscal externality associated with not working

relative to the wage.
Equation (2) emphasizes the optimal heterogeneity in social policy across areas, not optimal
redistribution across areas.

The equation implies that in areas where the elasticity of

employment with respect to the wage is higher, then the employment subsidy should be higher
relative to the payment for the jobless.
This can be interpreted as implying that even if the current U.S. benefits system for the
not working were kept entirely in place, it would be optimal to increase support for the
marginally employed in places where the employment response to wages is higher. Alternatively,
the equation can be interpreted to mean that it would be optimal to shift benefits from the jobless
to the marginally employed in states where employment is more responsible to the fiscal returns
to working.

If 𝜖𝜖𝑊𝑊
= 0, then consumption is equalized between the not working and the employed. If

0.75. If utility follows a constant relative risk aversion function of 0.5, then the optimal
consumption of the not working is 0.56 times that of the employed. A lower elasticity of labor

response of 0.1 will imply higher levels of redistribution to the not working, so that the not
working consume only 19 percent less than the employed.
These calculations suggest that small differences across space may generate large differences
in the appropriate balance between employment subsidy and non-employment benefits. In areas
where the sensitivity of employment to wages is high, then subsidizing not working becomes
particularly costly, when there are large externalities associated with non-employment. In areas
that are close to full employment, then subsidizing the poor is less problematic. In the next two
empirical sections, we discuss the evidence relating both to the size of the externality and to
differential employment responses by place.

Mobility Across Space
These calculations ignored mobility, which will reduce the appeal of redistribution across
space, but may not change equation (2). We can then solve the social insurance problem in two
steps: minimize expected social insurance payments in each location, holding expected utility
22

fixed, and choose the combination of the levels of expected utility and expenditures across space
to maximize aggregate social welfare internalizing migration and capitalization effects.

The

procedure can be separated as long as only expected utility impacts migrations, which will be
true if we assume migration decisions are made before an individual’s value of 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 is revealed.

is dual to the welfare maximization problem and also yields equation (2).

29

Incorporating

migration does impact the overall level of welfare in each area, but it does not change the
relationship between the marginal utility of consumption while working and not working. These
results would, however, change if individuals observed their value of 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 before migrating.

To formally model migration, we assume two locations and that people are endowed with a

preference for the second location of 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 , which is distributed according to a cumulative
distribution function G(.).

We ignore housing and spatial externalities and denote total

spending in region p as 𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 and expected utility in each region as 𝑈𝑈𝑝𝑝 �𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 �.

The spatial

equilibrium then defines a marginal migrant with a preference for location two of 𝜀𝜀 ∗, which is
defined so that 𝑈𝑈1 (𝑆𝑆1 ) = 𝑈𝑈2 (𝑆𝑆2 ) + 𝜀𝜀 ∗ , and the share of the population in location 1 equals 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀 ∗ ).
If the planner’s cost of funds are again 𝜗𝜗, the overall maximization problem can be written:
(3) 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀 ∗ )(𝑈𝑈1 (𝑆𝑆1 ) − 𝜗𝜗𝑆𝑆1 ) + �1 − 𝐺𝐺(𝜀𝜀 ∗ )�(𝑈𝑈2 (𝑆𝑆2 ) − 𝜗𝜗𝑆𝑆2 ) + ∫𝜀𝜀≥𝜀𝜀∗ . 𝜀𝜀𝜀𝜀𝜀𝜀(𝜀𝜀)

This leads to two first order conditions that can be combined to generate:

while equation (4) decreases the structure of payments across an area.

If 𝜖𝜖𝑁𝑁1

29

We are implicitly assuming that “k” represents a national rather than a local externality. Results are not significantly changed if k is
treated as a local cost born by potential migrants

23

spending must be equalized across areas. For intermediate levels of mobility, there will be more
spending on the area with a higher marginal utility of spending (𝑆𝑆2 > 𝑆𝑆1 if and only if 𝑈𝑈 ′ 2 (𝑆𝑆2 ) >

𝑈𝑈 ′1 (𝑆𝑆1 )).

This equation somewhat supports our previous discussion suggesting that

redistribution across space is more likely to enhance welfare when migration is more limited.
But the larger point of this section is that concerns about capitalization and migration influence
the expected welfare for residents of this area, but not the optimal ratio of marginal utility levels
for the employed and the not working. If the elasticity of the not working rate with respect to
wages is higher in one place, then that place should do more to make work pay.
A final “hot spots” related justification for targeting is that the macroeconomic costs of
supporting not working might be lower if we target West Virginia more than San Francisco.
Phillips-curve type reasoning suggests that reductions in unemployment might increase pressure
for wage-led inflation. This threat seems larger if San Francisco’s not working rate is being
pushed from five to two percent than if West Virginia’s not working rate is being pushed from
13 to ten percent.

The Downsides of Spatial Policy: Capitalization, Mobility and Cost
As the previous discussion emphasized, two of the major downsides of place-based strategies
are capitalization and distorted locational choice. If a place-based policy makes an area more
attractive to a group, then that group will move into the area, or bid up prices, or both, depending
on the elasticity of housing supply. The policy will impact prices more when the supply of space
is inelastic. The policy will distort location more when the supply of space is elastic, but even
when space is inelastic, there still can be a distortionary effect on the composition of the
population.
A third major downside of spatial policy is cost, which in turn is a function of the targeting of
the policy. In all three discussions, we assumed that subsidies and taxes are not well targeted
within the region. A general employment subsidy has these features, as would policies that
increase general labor demand in the poor region through the use of tax credits or direct
government spending. Yet it is possible to imagine policies that were more directly targeted
towards marginal workers. Those policies would reduce the taxes needed to encourage
employment and would also dampen capitalization and migration effects, since they impact a
smaller share of the population.
The three motives for place-based strategies have different implications for the costs of
capitalization and distorted mobility. If the point of spatial targeting is to achieve agglomeration24

related benefits, then distorted locational choice is not a problem but a desired outcome. The
point of the policy is to induce economic activity to relocate. Capitalization might be a slight
negative, in that the property owners will reap much of the benefits, but that would not
particularly undo the efficiency gains from relocation.
If the purpose of spatial targeting is to redistribute towards poorer residents, then relocation is
not intrinsically desirable. Yet if we cannot sign the impact of relocating people and firms on
aggregate efficiency, then we also cannot be sure whether inadvertent relocation generates
welfare losses or benefits. A prominent exception to this claim is that there may be considerable
downsides from concentrating poverty and non-employment, partially because this may cause
welfare losses to the poor that undo any benefits that come from targeting resources towards a
particular area.
Capitalization, by contrast, will tend to work against the redistributive benefits of targeting
resources towards poorer areas. If the primary beneficiaries of these benefits are the property
owners, then the policy may be progressive across places but regressive within places. Once
again, targeting can reduce the capitalization-related downsides of any policy.
If the goal is targeting resources against a demonstrable social problem, like non-employment,
then efficiency, not equity, is again the main objective. In that case, the redistribution to owners
due to capitalization is not particularly problematic, nor are distorted locational choices. Even
more broadly, the policy can be a place-based benefit shift, which fights non-employment
without inducing in-migration.

We now discuss the two parameters that are needed to use

equation (2), our modified Baily (1976)—Chetty (2006) formula.

IV. Do Employment Elasticities Differ Across Place?

The theoretical case for the spatial targeting of employment subsidies depends on whether such
policies have a greater marginal impact on employment in some areas. Employment subsidies
could have a larger impact in distressed areas, but the opposite is also possible. High not
working rate areas might have social problems that lead even fewer people to be on the margin
of working. High not working rate areas might have extremely inelastic labor demand, so that
few new jobs will created because of a subsidy.

The case for infrastructure, relative to

subsidies, is stronger when private labor demand is inelastic. It is an empirical question as to

25

whether interventions in high poverty areas are more likely to increase the level of
employment. 30
We have three ways of testing for differential employment elasticities.

First, and most

obviously, we look at the impact of labor demand shocks on the not working rate and test for
heterogeneity across space. Second, we review the surprisingly limited literature on
heterogeneous spatial impacts of social programs on the not working rate. Third, we revisit the
Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) evidence linking government spending to GDP growth and test
for heterogeneous treatment effects on the not working rate.

The Heterogeneous Impact of Labor Demand Shocks
We first look at the impact of labor demand shocks on the not working rate. We use a Bartik
(1991) demand shock, interacting initial industry shares with changes in the national
employment in the industry outside of the PUMA or state, or:

where 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is employment in industry i, location s and time t, 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is total employment in

𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑠𝑠
is the employment in industry i at time t in the United States
location s at time t, and 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡

outside of location s. Thus, this shock represents the percent growth in employment in the
location that would have been predicted if the location’s industries saw their employment grow
at the national average.
We look at Bartik effects both at the PUMA and the state level. We begin with state-level
estimates over the 1977-2016 period. Our first two regressions in Table 3 shows the negative
impact of the Bartik shock over the entire time period, as expected, and that this impact is larger
in states with higher initial not working rates. The third and fourth regressions show that this
interaction term is robust to the addition of year fixed effects. It does seem as if demand shocks
are more strongly associated with changes in the not working rate in places with a higher average
not working rates.
Regressions (5)-(6) show results for housing prices. The state-level housing price index is a
repeat sales index prepared by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Regression (5)
find that positive Bartik shocks are associated with more housing price growth, suggesting that

30

Our discussion of this question builds on the work of Bartik (2015), who finds some evidence that local demand shocks have a greater
impact in areas with higher initial unemployment rates. A large number of previous studies have also examined the persistence of local labor
demand shocks, with varying conclusions.

26

economic success is associated with higher housing costs but the coefficient is not statistically
significant. Regression (6) shows a strong positive interaction between the not working rate and
the Bartik shock. The Bartik shock has a statistically significant impact on the not working rates
in high not working rate states relative to other states, but this interaction is not statistically
significant for house prices.
Regressions (7) and (8) show results at the sub-state level using consistent Public Use
Microdata Areas (PUMAs), using annual changes since 2005 because of limited data availability
prior to that time period. The first regression shows that the Bartik shock has a strong negative
impact on the not working rate over this period. The second regression shows that this effect is
far more strongly concentrated in places that had high levels of the not working rate in 2005. A
ten percentage point change in the not working rate increases the impact of the Bartik shock by
almost 50 percent relative to a zero not working rate benchmark
[Table 3]
Finally, we examine the impact of trade shocks on prime male non-employment, using shocks
identified by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013). They use the change in Chinese import exposure
per worker in a region as their main measure of local labor market exposure to import
competition. To address potential endogeneity issues, they instrument growth in United States
imports with growth in Chinese imports in eight other developed economies. In Table 4 we
follow the approach in their paper and regress the share of not working men or long-term not
working men on the change in Chinese imports per worker.
[Table 4]
In regression (1) we examine the effect of a shock in Chinese imports on prime male not
working rates. As expected, increases in Chinese import exposure are associated with an increase
in the level of prime male non-employment, and the coefficients are statistically significant.
Regression (2) examines the heterogeneity of responsiveness based on initial not working rates
in 1990. We find that Commuting Zones with the highest levels of initial not working rates,
defined as being in the top 10 percent, experience a higher level of non-employment in response

27

to changes in Chinese import exposure. Regressions (3) and (4) report the same results for longterm not working rates, and we find a similar pattern, albeit with smaller absolute increases. 31
These results may be relatively unsurprising. A shock to local labor demand has more impact
on the not working rate in places where non-employment is high than in places that are already
near full employment. Yet this heterogeneity is crucial in justifying spatially heterogeneous
policies that encourage employment more in some areas than in others.

Heterogeneous Responses to Past Social Programs
There is surprisingly limited work testing whether national changes in policy have
heterogeneous treatment effects across space.

For example, a long literature (Meyer and

Rosenbaum, 2001, Eissa and Liebman, 1996) has examined the impact of the Earned Income
Tax Credit on employment. We have found none of these studies that ask whether the impact of
the credit was higher in places that had initially higher levels of non-employment. Neumark and
Wascher (2011) find interactions between the EITC and the state minimum wage, but the
imperfect relationship between the minimum wage and non-employment makes these hard to
interpret.
There is abundant evidence suggesting that targeted social programs can have a large impact
on the not working rate. For example, Miller et al. (2017) test an EITC like product that is
targeted towards people without children called paycheck plus. The treatment effect of the
product on employment outcomes, especially filing taxes, is higher for people who initially
earned less than $10,000 per year.

We hope that future research will test more regularly for

whether social interventions have more impact in some states than in others.

Spatial Heterogeneity in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014)
In this section, we use the shocks to federal spending that are identified by Nakamura and
Steinsson (2014). 32 We focus on state male not working rates as our outcome of interest and we
test for interactions between these shocks and the average not working rates within the state.
Their approach is to regress the percentage change in the employment rate within the state on the
change in military spending over the same period. They instrument for the change in military

31
We caution these results are merely suggestive of the importance of regional heterogeneity. The size and statistical significance of
heterogeneity is dependent on the exact form chosen. We have focused on the interaction of shocks with the initial not working rate, but other
local and state characteristics may also be important
32
A number of other studies have examined the heterogeneous impact of government expenditure at the local level. For example, see Dube,
Kaplan, and Zipperer (2015). A general review of local multipliers is provided by Chodorow-Reich (2017)

28

spending with the interaction between initial spending on the military in the state and changes in
national military spending.
The key identification assumptions needed for this approach is that the initial military spending
within the state is orthogonal to subsequent economic changes in the area, and that national
military spending has no correlation with local shocks that is not mediated by military spending
itself.

Those assumptions would be violated if national military spending was correlated with

other shocks to industrial demand or if local military spending predicted other changes in the
local economy.
Our specification is to follow Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) and regress:

where 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 refers to the not working rate in the state, and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 refers to per

capita military spending.

We instrument for the spending variable using the percentage growth

in national military spending interacted with a state dummy. This specification follows the
structure of the employment rate regressions in the original paper.
We do this for one, two and three year changes.

Our primary focus is on the interaction

between military spending and the average not working rate in the state. We implement this by
generating an interaction between the spending variable and an indicator variable that takes on a
value of one if the state is in among the 25 percent of states with the highest not working rate
over the entire time period. This is conceptually a different experiment that the Nakamura and
Steinsson (2014) interaction between military spending and whether the state has a high not
working rate figure relative to its historic norm.
[Table 5]
We show the one year change results in regressions (1) and (2). Regression (1) confirms that
the basic result holds for the not working rate. A one percent increase in military spending is
associated with a six percent decrease in the not working rate, although the coefficient is not
statistically significant.

Regression (2) shows that the coefficient on military spending

significantly larger in high not working rate areas and is statistically significant different from
low not working rate areas.

29

In regressions (3) and (4), we look at two year changes, which is the preferred specification of
Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) themselves. The overall effect on the not working rate itself is
significant at the 10 percent level. A one percent increase in military spending is associated with
a 6.3 percent decrease in the not working rate. The interaction with high not working rate is
small and insignificant.
In regressions (5) and (6), we look at the three year change in the not working rate.

In this

case, a one percent increase in military spending is associated with a 9.6 percent decrease in the
not working rate and is statistically significant at the five percent level. The interaction is
negative and economically meaningful in size, but so imprecise that we can draw little
confidence from this result. Overall, these results, especially for the one-year changes, suggest
that military spending might be more effective in high not working rate areas, but they are no
more than suggestive.
V. The Externalities of Not Working

If joblessness generates no externalities, then there is no reason for the government to promote
employment in our model. There may still a redistributive or insurance motive for spatial policy,
but there would be little reason to focus particularly on joblessness. In this section, we discuss
the three types of externalities associated with non-employment: pure fiscal losses from reduced
taxes and increased social spending; social spillovers born by family and friends; and not
working spillovers where one individual not working increases the chance that other workers
don’t work.

We do not consider externalities that could work through congestion of the

employment matching process, primarily because we consider congestion to be a short run
phenomenon, while we are primarily in the long run costs of concentrated non-employment.

Fiscal Externalities: Taxes and Spending
The most obvious externality associated with non-employment is the cost born by other
taxpayers due to a reduction in tax revenue and increase in public expenditures. We first focus
on the income of not working prime-aged men, to understand the amount of public resources
they are receiving. Data is averaged over the 2010-2015 period and based on the Annual Social
and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey.
Table 6 shows income sources for four groups: all employed prime-aged men, the low income
employed which are defined as having family annual earnings below $40,000, men who are not

30

working and have been not working for less than twelve months, and men who have been not
working for more than 12 months.
[Table 6]
The missing earnings of the not working are supplemented mainly by disability payments and
by the other residents of their own home. The added public expenditure going to the short term
not working relative to low income workers is $2350; the average added expenditure going to the
long-term not working is $6300. Average over the entire not working population, the increase is
$4900, which is 26 percent of low income individual wages in this sample
In Table 7, we break out the earnings of the long-term not working by region.
[Table 7]
The results are quite similar. The family incomes in the heartland areas are lower than in the
coastal states. Disability payments are higher in the eastern heartland than in the other regions.
Nowhere are family transfers a large share of total earnings.
As disability is such an important part of public support for not working men, we now focus on
the geography and time series of disability in the U.S. The next map shows disability rates
across the U.S.
[Figure 15]
We see the familiar pattern of suffering in the eastern heartland, but higher rates of being on
disability certainly don’t seem to generate higher earnings for the not working.
But should disability be seen as a transfer to the not working that would stop if employment
increased, or a social insurance program that compensates the unlucky who receive negative
health shocks and couldn’t work in any case?
severe health problems.

Many of the not working report regular and

The next figure shows that over 30 percent of the not working in all

three regions report ten or more days of severe health problems over the past month.
[Figure 16]
Autor and Duggan (2003) depict disability as a substitute for unemployment insurance that
may be better seen as a social cost of non-employment, rather than an independent insurance
program. Kostol and Mogstad (2014) show that when disabled people are able to keep more of
31

their earnings in Norway, they work and earn more. Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2013) examine
borderline applicants for Social Security Disability Insurance, and find that employment would have
been 28 percentage points higher amongst successful applicants if they had not received benefits.
French and Song (2014) find a similar decrease in employment amongst applicants who successfully
appeal their applications compared to those who are unsuccessful. These papers suggest that at least

part of the disability cost should be seen as a fiscal externality generated by non-employment.
In Table 8, we turn to expenditures using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We
split the population into employed, employed living alone, low income employed (again earning
less than $40,000 per annum) and long-term not working living alone.
[Table 8]
The not working, unsurprisingly, pay far fewer taxes than employed men generally, who pay
over $15,000 annually, or employed men living alone, who pay almost $10,000. However, if the
comparison is with low-income men living alone the gulf in taxes is much smaller. The not
working men living alone contribute 608 dollars in taxes, as opposed to $1800 in taxes for the
low-income employed.
If the relevant margin is between non-employment and average earnings, then tax related fiscal
externality is over $9,000. If the relevant margin is between non-employment and low-income
wage labor, then the tax-related fiscal externality is much smaller, closer to $1200.
Perhaps, the most surprising fact is that the expenditures of the not working are much higher
than their income level and not that much lower than the expenditures of the low-income
employed, who spend $27,200 annually. The not working who live alone spend $20,500. The
plausible explanations for the gap between expenditures and earnings in this group including
running down savings, borrowing, unreported family transfers and perhaps even illicit earnings.
Typically, this group has neither significant assets nor great credit, which makes it hard to
believe that past savings and borrowing can explain the gap. They report low levels of family
transfers.
The small gap in spending between low income employed and not working suggests that
Keynesian externalities associated with moving the not working into low wage jobs is small.
The largest spending increase associated with employment is transportation, which may reflect
the costs of getting to and from work. The employed also spend 300 dollars more on alcohol
annually, $1300 more on housing and $1200 more on food. The greater food expenditure may
reflect some eating out on the job.
32

Does this data suggest a large fiscal externality from non-employment? Benefits fall by $4900
and taxes fall by $1200, when we compare the not working with low wage workers. If one-half
of the disability payments would have been paid in any case, then the benefit gap drops to $3200,
making the total fiscal externality $4400, which is 23% of the earnings of the low income
individuals.

Social Externalities born by Families and Friends
We now turn to the costs of non-employment that are born by family and friends. A large
share of the long-term not working do not live alone, but many of these men are not married.
Figure 17 shows the time series of the share of men who have ever married, for the employed,
the short term not working and the long term not working. The three lines show parallel upward
trends, with the not working always being less likely to have married than the employed.

By

2015, one-half of the long-run not working have never married, and over 40 percent of the shortterm not working have never married. Less than 30 percent of the employed have never married.
[Figure 17]
The share of the employed that is separated or divorced has risen over time. The separated or
divorced share of the not working has remained steady at about 20 percent. Consequently, only
30 percent of the long-term not working have current spouses, and the majority of their cohabitants are not their current spouses.
[Figure 18]
In many cases, the not working are actually living with their parents. The next figure shows
the trend in cohabitating with parents by employment status. This figure has always been high
for the long-run not working, but it has risen in recent years to over thirty percent. The long-run
not working are split relatively evenly between living with a spouse, a parent or some alternative.
[Figure 19]
Does non-working also impose externalities on family and friends who subsidize the not
working? If nuclear families are unitary decision-makers, then they are presumably making a
joint decision about work and leisure. If men make independent decisions about work, and then

33

spouses bargain ex post about the share of rents, then spouses will presumably lose their share of
the foregone earnings.
Some of those externalities will be offset if the not working spouse participates more in
household production, but time use surveys suggest that this is not the case. Table 9 shows the
time use of employed and not working men by region.
[Table 9]
Working men spent almost exactly 530 minutes per day in personal care, ninety five percent of
which is typically sleep. They work an average between 382 and 401 minutes per day, which
corresponds roughly with a 6.5 hour workday, averaged over the course of the week. Notably,
the men in the western heartland do seem to put in longer hours. They offset this time by
spending slightly less time in leisure activities. Television remains the dominant use of leisure
time and takes up slightly over two hours per day for working men.
Not working men work about six hours less per day. This extra time is spent primarily in
leisure activities. The not working in the eastern heartland spend over five hours daily watching
television. There is also an uptick in computer gaming, as noted by Aguiar, Bils, and Hurst
(2017).
The not working men of the coasts and the western heartland increase their time spent on these
household production tasks by 56 and 59 minutes respectively. The modal categories for male
household activities are food preparation and lawn work. Consequently, even for this group, less
than one-sixth of the time freed up by non-working goes to activities that benefit the household
rather than private consumption. By contrast, not working men in the eastern heartland spend
only 30 more minutes on household activities than working men and nine more minutes caring
for others.
The view that spouses are not benefiting from their partners’ non-employment is further
supported by the correlation between not working and divorce rates. It is not merely that the not
working are more likely to be divorced. Losing one’s jobs is associated with a higher risk of
becoming divorced (Killewald, 2016). While this fact has many interpretations, one view is that
male non-employment is a negative shock to their spouse.
We will take the stand that bargaining is efficient between spouses, but not between parents
and children.

Consequently, for the approximately 25 percent of the not working population

that lives with their parents, non-housing expenditures represents an externality from nonemployment. The long-term not working who live alone have total non-housing expenditures of
34

11,291.

Consequently, not working generates an average family externality of $2822, which is

15 percent of low-wage income.

This figure is a crude attempt to capture intra-family losses,

“internalities,” and the more general spillovers from not working that we discuss next, collective
this brings the total externality to $7222, which is 38 percent of low wage earnings.

Non-employment Spillovers
The suffering of not working will be magnified if not working spills over across individuals.
This spillover could occur because an individual’s not working leads to less demand for local
products, which reduces local labor demand. Non-employment could also spill over if it reduces
the stigma of not working (as in Lindbeck et al., 1999), creates a culture of not working or if the
not working enjoy being with each other. 33
Topa (2001) presents the now-standard model of this phenomenon. He estimates this model
using tract level data from Chicago using a structural model. The sorting of the unemployed
within the city provides evidence that support the view that the unemployment of one person is a
complement to the unemployment of his neighbor. Conley and Topa (2002) extend this analysis
to a larger geographic area.
Clark (2003) provides evidence for the social norm hypothesis. He finds evidence that the selfreported life satisfaction of unemployed is much higher if there is more unemployment in the
individual’s reference group. He also finds that individual’s whose unhappiness drops more at
the point of unemployment are more likely to find future employment. These findings seem to
suggest that a norm of not working translates into still more long-term non-employment. A final
piece of evidence supporting the non-employment spillover hypothesis is that aggregate
employment relationships with variables like tax rates are often much stronger than individual
employment relationships (Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote, 2005), which suggests the existence
of a social multiplier.
VI. Calibrating the Level of Place-Based Interventions

We now use the modified Baily (1976)—Chetty (2006) formula discussed in Section III, and
attempt to obtain quantitative estimates of the optimal degree of place-based heterogeneity. We
consider two thought experiments. First, we assume that existing benefits continue in place, and
we estimate the optimal allocations of new employment subsidy across space. The relevant first

The welfare effects of such spillovers would be ambiguous. The not working benefit from having more not working friends, even if others
pay the costs of a generally higher not working rate.

.

Our model does not incorporate wage effects of subsidies,

or migration and capitalization, which could be significant by-products of the first thought
experiment, but not the second. Consequently, these calculations are illustrative at best.
In both cases, we depend on place-specific estimates of the extensive margin elasticity of labor
supply. Our purpose here is to emphasize the heterogeneity across America, not to advance the
considerable literature on labor supply. 34 We use a simple empirical approach regressing log
wages for the 25th percentile of employed men on the log employment rate at the PUMA level.
We instrument for wages using Bartik shocks as described above. The use of a Bartik shock as
an instrument for labor demand is discussed in detail in Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift
(2018). They show that using Bartik shocks as instruments is numerically equivalent to using
industry shares as instruments. Therefore, identification is dependent on the exogeneity of
initial industry shares.
Table 10 summarizes the results. The coefficient on log wages is small and insignificant, but
the interaction of wages and the 1980 not working rate is large and significant.
[Table 10]
The measured elasticity varies over space, with greater responsiveness in high not working rate
areas. Wyoming had the lowest not working rate in 1980 of 6.5 percent, and the implied
elasticity is 0.04. West Virginia had the highest not working rate in 1980 of 16.5 percent, and the
implied elasticity is 0.25. We hope that this simple approach will be superseded in future work
that will bring more sophisticated estimation techniques to assess the heterogeneity in labor
supply elasticities across space.
We assume a constant relative risk aversion utility function, with a coefficient of relative risk
aversion of 𝛾𝛾. Andersen et. al. (2008) estimate that coefficient is 0.741 in laboratory experiments

with relatively low stakes. Cohen and Einav (2007) estimate a median coefficient of relative risk
aversion of 0.37 from deductible choices in auto insurance. Barsky et. al. (1997) find evidence
34

. For example, Juhn, Murphy and Topel (1991) find the partial elasticity varies depending on the income distribution of men, with an
average value of 0.13 and a high value of 0.35 for men in the 10th percentile of income. Meghir and Phillips (2010) similarly find a higher
elasticity of 0.4 for low-income men in the UK. Broader reviews include Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) and Chetty et. al. (2013).

for higher values using larger gambles. Some macroeconomic estimates associated with
explaining the equity premium puzzle are higher still. We report values assuming coefficients of
0.5, 1.0, and 2.0.

= 𝜗𝜗, and we implement it by

= 0, and 𝑒𝑒0 = 0. Essentially, we are

asking how much larger a region’s employment subsidy should be than a place where there is no

employment response to wages and consequently no employment subsidy. We assume that the
marginal worker’s wage is everywhere fixed at 𝑤𝑤0 and independent of the employment subsidy,

perhaps because the wage is determined by the federal minimum wage.

We can then consider the optimal subsidy given our estimates of differential employment

elasticity.

For example, low not working rate states such as Wyoming have an estimated

elasticity close to zero, suggesting a minimal optimal employment subsidy. High not working
rate areas such as West Virginia, with an estimated elasticity of .25, has an optimal subsidy equal
to 15 percent of wages, if the coefficient of relative risk aversion equals 0.5, an optimal subsidy
of close to 7 percent of wages if the coefficient is 1, and less than five percent of wages if the
coefficient is 2. High coefficients meant strong concavity that reduces the benefits of the
employment subsidy.
The previous thought experiment was a bonus that just allocated employment dollars to high
not working rate states.

Figure 20 then illustrates the optimal employment subsidy twist as a function of 𝜖𝜖𝑊𝑊 for the

three different cases of CRRA utility.

35
We make the simplifying assumption that the labor elasticity in the region is constant as we change the employment subsidy. We recognize
this is not accurate, and a more complete calibration would involve imputing the reservation wages for not working men in each region.

37

[Figure 20]
Again we can match the theoretical predictions against different states. In states with low
elasticities, we find the optimal size of employment subsidy is negative, so that the optimal
change to the benefit scheme would be to increase benefits for the not working by increasing
taxes. 36 Indeed, if the coefficient of relative risk aversion is 2, then the model almost always
pushes towards more transfers for the not working because of such strong concavity.

When the

coefficient of risk aversion is .5, again the model suggests an employment subsidy of 15 percent
or more in states like West Virginia depending on the elasticity.
Finally, we can calculate the predicted optimal ratio of consumption when working or not
working in different states, based on their employment and not working share. Our ratio of the
fiscal and other externalities of not working to the wage is .382 from the previous section. The
not working rate is somewhat more complicated, as this is the share of the low skill, at-risk
workers who are not working, not the not working share of the entire population. We use our
previous definition of low-income men as men who are employed and have a total family income
of less than $40,000 per annum. Using this definition, we find the not working rate for at-risk
workers varies from 39.5% in Wyoming to 61.0% in West Virginia using 2014-2016 average
ASEC responses.
Table 11 summarizes our results. We find that our model predicts that the ratio of consumption
of not working to employed men should indeed be lower in high not working rate areas. While
these values are only tentative, they illustrate the importance of considering spatially
heterogeneous policy responses to non-employment.

In a broader model, the funds could come from other sources than just taxes on low income earners.

38

We view these results as thought experiments, not serious policy proposals.

These

calculations suggest that if utility functions are not too concave, then significantly stronger
subsidies for employment would be optimal for states like West Virginia.

That conclusion

would be tempered if wages fell with subsidies, or if the subsidies distorted migration.

If

migration was a paramount concern, then our model suggested that there could even be welfare
gains in high not working rate areas by replacing benefits for the not working with benefits that
subsidized marginal workers. In low not working rate areas, more benefits for the not working
were welfare-enhancing, especially when risk aversion was high.
Place-Based Policies: Efficacy, Capitalization and Mobility

VII.

We now turn to a brief taxonomy of place-based policies in the U.S. and elsewhere. Our goal
is to link these policies with the three objectives discussed before, and to discuss the evidence on
their downsides, including capitalization, distorted location choice and overall cost. We do not
focus on the spatial heterogeneity that occurs because of differences in local government actions,
but rather ways in which national governments and the European Union generate policies with
spatially heterogeneous effects.

A central theme of this section is that spatial policies have the

largest impact when they are targeted towards the needs and problems of particular regions.

A Taxonomy
Spatial policies can be explicit, openly targeting one area or another, or implicit, aiding
particular areas disproportionately, but without an acknowledgement of the geographic tilt.
Spatial policies can take the form of direct public investment, tax benefits or subsidies to
businesses, tax benefits or grants to individuals, and regulatory relief.

The following table

provides a brief summary of the eight categories in our taxonomy, with a few examples of each
form.

Direct Public Investment
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), for example, was a New Deal innovation, meant to
deliver electricity and improve conditions in one of the poorest parts of the country.

The TVA

began not with a desire for a spatial big push, but with the recognition that electricity could have
high returns and could be produced by the region’s abundant hydropower.

Kline and Moretti

(2013) provide evidence showing that the TVA increased agricultural employment in the region
while subsidies were in place and manufacturing employment even after the subsidies ended.
They interpret their findings as suggesting that the TVA generated durable agglomeration
economies.

An alternative interpretation is the TVA was successful because it delivered

electricity, which had a particularly high return in the Tennessee Valley.
Kline and Moretti (2013) also provide evidence relevant for both capitalization and mobility.
None of their specifications show a positive impact of the TVA on population growth within the
region, suggesting there were minimal distortions of location choice, which perhaps reflect the
fact that the TVA was supposed to pay for itself eventually.

In some, but not all of their

specification, there is a positive impact on median housing value. Yet those positive effects do
not withstand the inclusion of other controls.

40

The second particularly well-known spatial program in the U.S. was the Appalachian Regional
Commission (ARC), which became a Federal agency in 1965. The Commission’s was motivated
by local poverty, not any obvious economic opportunity and its geographic scope runs through
13 states, and includes all of West Virginia. The Commission provides grants in many areas, but
its signature project is the Appalachian Development Highway System, which provides highway
access throughout the region. Economic conditions in the impacted counties do seem to have
improved during the 1970s, but there is little evidence of any more durable economic
transformation (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2008).

The program’s scale was modest, relative to the

size of the region, which makes ex post evaluation difficult.

Nonetheless, the ARC’s limited

success surely reflects its failure to find a high return regional intervention.
The European Union’s Cohesion policy is a much larger example of spatially targeted public
investment. The Cohesion policy’s explicit goal is to reduce income disparities within the Union,
partially to reduce the political tensions that can come with heterogeneity.

The policy

differentiates at the sub-national level, so while Warsaw is considered to be more developed, the
rest of Poland is less developed. Boldrin and Canova (2001) and Dall’Erba and LeGallo (2007)
both conclude that this policy is ineffective. Cappelen et al. (2003) find modest positive effects,
which are larger in more developed countries. Again, the policies seem to have limited effect
because they focus on spreading money around rather than on interventions that have high
returns in particular places.
Within the U.S. and elsewhere, spatially motivated infrastructure investment has been much
less important to spatial development than non-spatially motivated infrastructure investment.
The Federal Highway System, for example, was not intended to help suburbanize America or to
strengthen particularly communities relative to others. Yet Baum-Snow (2007) finds that each
new highway that was built in a metropolitan area with Federal support after World War II
reduced the central city’s population by 18 percent.

Duranton and Turner (2012) find

significant effects of highway construction on the economic development of connected
metropolitan areas. The large mobility effects of the highway system reflect the fact that the
system delivered mobility that was valued by millions of Americans. 37
While Aschauer (1989), Munnell (1992) and others have found positive effects of
infrastructure on local economic activity, Garin (2017) finds almost no impact of American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) transportation spending on employment.

One

37
A host of studies also find impacts of highways on local property values (e.g. Chernobai, Reibel and Carney, 2011). A working paper
version of Duranton and Turner (2012) found that more highway miles were associated with slight decreases in the number of poor people and
the number of high school dropouts, suggesting that if anything the sorting effects of infrastructure are slightly positive.

41

interpretation of the difference is that the earlier studies focused on a period in which
infrastructure brought high value to drivers and consequently also moved activity across space.
Gramlich (1994) is particularly associated with the view that the returns to infrastructure have
declined over time. The modest impact of recent subways on urban structure (Baum-Snow and
Kahn, 2005) is compatible with the view that investments that are poorly targeted towards local
demand also have little spatial impact.
Supporters of spatial targeting for direct government spending sometimes argue that in some
cases, spatial effects can be generated at moderate cost. For example, if the government is going
to spend a fixed amount on the military, then locating an installation in Mississippi rather than
New York may be largely irrelevant to any military objectives. Nakamura and Steinsson (2014)
find significant effects of military spending on the local economy.

Faggio and Overman

(2014), however, use quasi-exogenous shifts in the size of local government to estimate the
spillovers from increases in public employment. They find that one extra job in the public sector
generates .5 extra service sector jobs and crowds out .4 tradable sector jobs. 38 One explanation
for the difference may be that non-military employment crowds out local jobs, but military
employment is sufficiently different so that it does not.
The land grant colleges may have been the Federal governments most successful forays in
place-making. 39

These educational institutions, subsidized with Federal land, are strongly

associated with high incomes (Moretti, 2003) and population growth during recent decades
(Glaeser and Saiz, 2004).

Once again, these interventions seem to have been spatially effective

because they supported an activity that was thought to have high returns regardless of any spatial
dimension.
Most direct public investment is probably most compatible with the agglomeration-related
justifications for spatial intervention.

Indeed, one interpretation of the Tennessee Valley

Authority results is that this investment generated a “big push” that took advantage of convex
agglomeration economics.

We are far from confident about economists’ current ability to

identify such opportunities. The general existence of agglomeration economies may support the
case for national pro-investment policies, such as reducing taxes on capital gains, but unless we
understand the spatial heterogeneity of agglomeration effects, the existence of agglomeration
does not justify spatially heterogeneous polices.

38

Ades and Glaeser (1995) argue that political forces explain why the capital cities of dictatorships and unstable democracies are about 40
percent larger than the capital cities of stable democracies. There is little doubt that enough government spending of the right kind can impact a
local economy.
39
A second unplanned Federal place-making policy was the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. This act allowed researchers to capitalize on ideas
developed with the support of Federal Grants. Haussman (2017) shows the economic activity increased around universities after the act.

42

Most of the best agglomeration studies (e.g. Combes et. al., 2012) support the existence of
agglomeration economies, but they give us little confidence about heterogeneity of local
spillovers across space.

The million-dollar plant identification strategy of Greenstone,

Hornbeck and Moretti (2010) provides little hope of identifying heterogeneous agglomeration
effects because great swaths of America, especially the high-income coastal regions, were
generally not recipients of these plants. Consequently, it is impossible to know whether a
relocation of capital and labor from Los Angeles to Kentucky will lead to benefits in Kentucky
that are large enough to offset the losses in Los Angeles.
Local Employment Subsidies
The case for spatial targeting is that supporting employment may have a particularly high
return in particular places.
employment subsidies.

There is a serious literature that documents the effects of national

Gruber (1997) finds that the elimination of the payroll tax in Chile was

larger passed along in the form of higher wages and did little to employment.

Heckman and

Pages (2000) find that between 20 and 70 percent of firm’s social security contributions in Latin
America are passed along to workers in the form of lower wages.

The EITC literature has

typically found that most of the benefit of the credit accrues to workers (Rothstein, 2010).

The

track record of local employment subsidies is more mixed, perhaps they have not been targeted
towards places where they would be most effective.
The literature on local employment subsidies is large and varied.

Skepticism about direct

government spending led the government of Margaret Thatcher towards a different approach:
enterprise zones.

Sir Peter Hall is generally credited with the idea of reducing taxes and

regulation in troubled urban areas. Despite his solid credentials as a social democrat, Hall had
been impressed with the success of Hong Kong and Singapore (Hall, 1982) and hypothesized
that a similar light-handed touch could engender economic regeneration in England’s troubled
inner cities.
The Thatcher government embraced Hall’s vision, and the United Kingdom began its program
of providing tax benefits for firms operating in particular urban locations.

Butler (1980)

embraced their adoption in the United States. While the Federal government would not begin its
program of “empowerment zones” until 1993, a plethora of states experimented with enterprise
zones during the 1980s.

The hallmark of such zones is that firms derive some tax benefit from

operating within a disadvantaged area.

43

While Enterprise and Empowerment zones are typically targeted at small, urban depressed
areas, other countries have offered tax incentives for businesses that locate in larger regions.
Since 1987, Italy has offered corporate tax exemptions for firms operating in the poorer
Mezzogiorno region, which includes southern Italy and Sicily. These incentives are larger for
firms that fall within the government’s favored industrial initiatives. France has been offering
grants to firms that spread industry away from Paris since the 1960s.

The Netherlands also

offers targeted spatial incentives for businesses.
Rubin and Richards (1992) provided an early assessment of the effects of these zones in the
U.K. and across U.S. states, and concluded that the U.K. experience was relatively unsuccessful.
They estimate a cost per job of about fifty thousand pounds, which annualizes to be about
$14,000 per job-year, which would be almost $30,000 per job year today. Papke (1994) relied
on these figures in her assessment of the difficulties facing enterprise zones in the U.S.

Wilder

and Wilder and Rubin (1996) summarized a large number of early studies, and found wildly
divergent impacts. In some cases, the cost per job was as low as $1,000.
In the past twenty years, the literature on state enterprise zones has grown, but results seem to
be quite sensitive to the time period and approach.

Bondonio and Engberg (2000) and

Greenbaum and Engberg (2004) find little effect on employment or industrial expansion using a
standard difference-in-difference approach. O’Keefe (2004) compares enterprise zone areas in
California with other areas that are matched using propensity score techniques. She finds a
short-run three percent increase in employment associated with enterprise zone status, but less of
a long-run effect.
Neumark and Kolko (2010) use particularly fine-grained geography and find no impact of the
California program. Ham et al. (2011) also use fine geographies, and work hard to distinguish
different programs. They find a negative impact on the unemployment rate, but do not find a
positive impact on employment. Yet if enterprise zones reduce unemployment, but don’t increase
employment, then they must operate by reducing the amount of job seeking, which is a
surprising finding.
The most impressive piece of recent research on zones is Busso, Gregory and Kline (2013),
which has a relatively positive conclusion about the impact of Federal empowerment zones.
They compare labor market outcomes in the first round of empowerment with a treatment group
that consists of areas that also competed for zone status. They have access to confidential
Census micro data and find positive impacts on employment, earnings and housing prices. They
do not see significantly rising rents in empowerment zones.
44

The Busso, Gregory and Kline (2013) estimates have been used to produce a cost of only
$18,000 per job, although it is unclear how many years of employment this means. Nonetheless,
this figure is quite low relative to other estimates, which are often closer to $100,000.

One

interpretation of the Busso, Gregory and Kline (2013) results it that the national Empowerment
Zones subsidized employment in places where there were an abundance of potential employers
and marginal workers.

By contrast, the U.K. Enterprise Zones and state enterprise zones may

have been more scattered.
Busso, Gregory and Kline (2013) also find significant capitalization in housing values, but
little in rents. Hanson (2009) and Krupka and Noonan (2009) find broadly similar results, again
using a synthetic control group based on areas that applied for but did not receive empowerment
zone status. 40

Research on the capitalization of other social interventions into property values

is more limited. 41
Betcherman, Daysal and Pagés (2010) provide a particularly relevant analysis of spatially
targeted employment subsidies in Turkey.

They find that the employment subsidies did

substantially increase jobs, but that the cost was considerable. But they also conclude that the
programs were poorly targeted, and as much as 78 percent of the benefits were paid for jobs that
would have existed even without the program. They call these costs deadweight losses, but we
think that they are better interpreted as a transfer to firms’ owners.

Individual Tax Credits/Grants
Location-specific tax benefits towards individuals are less common spatial policies. The U.S.
does, of course, have significant spatial heterogeneity in state and local tax rates, but these
differences are presumably also tied to differences in spending and services.

Norway’s grants

of tax benefits to the residents of its colder, darker northern climes are an example, but notably
these benefits merely subsidize location, not employment or other behaviors.
Intellectually, there would seem to be no reason why places couldn’t be targeted by individual
tax benefits as much as firm-specific tax credits, yet there are good reasons why these are less
common. The primary benefit of standard tax credits would tend to be richer, rather than poorer
residents, and this makes them poorly targeted for spatially targeted redistribution.

Inducing

business location in a particular area may achieve agglomeration related benefits.

Inducing

40
An alternative approach might be to follow Black (1999) and focus on the spatial discontinuity at the edge of the zone that determines where
firms receive an employment credit of up to $3,000 for employing a local resident.
41
There is compelling evidence that quasi-random increases in property taxes, caused by court-mandated property revaluation, is capitalized
into low property values (Yinger, Bloom and Boersch-Supan, 2016). Stull and Stull (1991) find evidence for capitalization of difference in local
income taxes within the Philadelphia area.

45

people to locate in an area, without associated jobs, would have fewer agglomeration benefits
and could potentially make local non-employment problems worse.

The political backlash

against place-based individual tax subsidies might be significant.
National tax policy can have important spatial dimensions. Gyourko and Sinai (2003), for
example, show that the benefits of the home mortgage interest deduction accrue to some places
more than others. 42 The 2017 tax reform’s changes to the deductibility of state and local taxes
represents a major spatial policy, essentially benefitting low tax areas at the expense of high tax
areas.
There are large literatures on both the capitalization and migration impacts of differences in
state taxes. Oates (1969) famously reported significant capitalization of tax differences into
property values, but the subsequent literature has been far less clear.

Bakija and Slemrod

(2004) find that the elderly rich move to avoid high estate taxes, but few more general results
have been established on tax based migration.
Federal benefits, such as Unemployment Insurance and Disability, can also spatially targeted.43
Prior to the 1994 welfare reform, there were significant differences across states in the generosity
of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. While the program was
nation-wide, states could choose their benefit levels, and they paid for part of the benefit.
There is little literature on the capitalization of AFDC differences, but there is a healthy
literature on whether these payments induced migration of the poor.

Blank (1988) found that

single-parent families were more likely to leave areas with less generous AFDC payments.
Borjas (1999) argued that the disproportionate flow of immigrants into California reflected that
states particularly high levels of AFDC payments.
While it may be harder to imagine a program that increases nominal payments in some states,
programs with constant nominal benefits are the norm, and those benefits have greater value in
low price states. Since government tax dollars go further when local prices are lower, price
heterogeneity also gives an added push to spending more in places where costs are lower
(Kaplow, 1996, Glaeser and Saiz, 2004). A ramped up version of the Earned Income Tax Credit
that provided a uniform hourly work subsidy would have a more disproportionate real impact in
lower income parts of the country.

42
David Albouy has argued that the spatial implications of the deduction are helpful in undoing the spatial distortions created by the income
tax itself, which deters people from moving to high income areas.
43
Bartik and Erickcek’s (2014) discussion of targeted training programs does not explicitly focus on spatial targeting, but the possibility is
clearly implicit in his discussion.

46

Regulatory Heterogeneity
The original enterprise zone model also envisioned significant regulatory relief. In practice,
these zones were more likely to feature tax relief rather than regulatory relief. In the U.S., this
reflects the fact that the national government has little power to override local regulation.
Globally, there are many prominent examples of zones that offer a special set of rules to
businesses.

The Special Economic Zones of China, for example, were a powerful example of

how business formation can be abetted with freedom from China’s robust business controls.
Within the U.S., the Devens Enterprise Commission provides a small local example of a zone
with light regulation. When Fort Devens shut, the Massachusetts State government attempted to
encourage business formation in the area with one-stop permitting. The commission claims have
been successful at encouraging new business formation, but there is no academic research
documenting its success.
Firms also experience different levels of regulation when they operate in areas that are deemed
to be environmentally sensitive.
historic preservation districts.

Builders face different regulations when they operate in
In these cases, historic differences across geography have

regulatory consequences that also impact the level of economic activity.
There are also historical accidents that lead to significant regulatory differences.

The U.K.

Channel Islands are not actually part of the United Kingdom or the European Union.
Consequently, they operate under a different set of financial regulations that have made them a
hot spot for a variety of financial service firms.
Restricting the supply of new housing restricts migration into particular areas and boost prices
in those areas (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2017).

We have less evidence on whether other forms of

regulation have such impacts. Consequently, one of the best justifications for districts with
different types of regulations is that they enable us to experiment with new types of regulations.
For example, entrepreneurship districts that relaxed regulations on new businesses would allow
us to learn the impact of such interventions.

VIII. Place-Based Policies for America
Our theoretical section suggested that public support should shift towards encouraging
employment, rather than supporting the not working, in areas where employment responses to
earnings are particularly high.

Our empirical section suggested that employment elasticities in

some states, like West Virginia, may be much higher than in other states, like Wyoming. Our
conclusion is that a policy mix that encourages more employment in high non-employment
47

states, such as West Virginia, may yield greater benefits than uniform national policies that treat
all states equally.
We begin with the two most plausible examples of such place-based actions: targeted location
of public activities and infrastructure investment. We then turn to employment subsidies, which
are a natural tool for fighting non-employment, but harder to target spatially.

Finally, we end

with education interventions, and prodding community colleges to focus more on employability
in high not working rate regions.

The Location of Public Activity and Infrastructure Investment
While there are approximately 22 million public sector workers within the U.S., only 2.8
million of those workers are actually in the Federal government.

This relatively small

employment share necessarily limits the magnitude of any relocation of Federal activities.
Moreover, 51 percent of these workers are either in the military or in veteran’s affairs, and
consequently, any serious relocation policy would need to focus on the military. 44
While there is the mixed evidence on the employment effects of public activity, the location of
military bases does seem positively impact on the local economy (Nakamura and Steinsson,
2014). The harder question, which we cannot answer, is what are the costs of geographic
targeting of military spending. Shuttering and re-opening the same base somewhere else seems
prohibitively expensive. The best opportunities for geographic targeting occur at the points of
base openings and closing. In principle, new bases can be sited and old based can be kept open
in areas with more elastic employment responses to labor demand.
The most reasonable proposal might ask the military to incorporate the impacts on local
employment into their calculations. If the military actually used cost-benefit analysis in location
decisions, it would be straightforward to multiply employment effects with estimates of the
externalities from employment and incorporate this total location-specific benefit into
calculations.
The Department of Veterans’ Affairs is a second large federal employee. The V.A. has fewer
spatially lump assets, but it does maintain hospitals and large offices. Again, the department
could be encouraged to internalize the local employment impacts when they open and shut
facilities, but this would be fundamentally limited by the need to match medical facilities to the

44

Spatial targeting could also be with the much larger set of Federal government contractors.
Yet imposing added geographic restrictions on
contractors would be cumbersome, and make other objectives, such as supporting minority-owned businesses, more difficult. Moreover,
geographic targeting would be quite susceptible to gaming. We suspect that a requirement to use Kentucky-based software providers would
lead to re-labeling rather than large-scale employment in Kentucky.

48

location of military retirees.

Non-medical V.A employment is more spatially fungible, but it

that represents a modest share of the total employment.
While the location decisions of the Federal government could internalize local employment
effects, we are doubtful that such policies could ever be significant in practice.

The military

will surely oppose any push to have them internalize non-military objectives. The Veterans’
Administration will similarly move only with difficulty.
Federally funded infrastructure projects are perhaps the most popular tool for encouraging
local economic development. Yet these projects also have a very mixed record of encouraging
local employment (Garin, 2017) and there is an inherent tension between targeting infrastructure
towards growing successful areas that need more infrastructure and supporting distressed areas
with highly elastic labor supply.

America’s most glaring infrastructure deficits are visible in

large, busy urban areas where airports, like New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport, are under
maintained and where public transportation and highways are highly congested.
If users are willing to pay for both the operating and capital costs of a project, then it is
unlikely to be a white elephant. If modest Federal investment can spur self-financing
infrastructure projects in distressed areas then there seems to be little downside risk.

But do

there exist a large number of such potential projects?
The Tennessee Valley Authority was close to being such a project.

The original financing of

the T.V.A. came from the Federal government, but the early investment has been repaid. The
T.V.A. also benefited from using eminent domain to move thousands of farmers to gain access to
waterways, but many of those farmers benefitted from subsequent electricity access.

The

T.V.A. succeed because it offered a transformative technology – electricity – with abundant
demand.
The Trump Administration’s infrastructure plan combines a modest amount of Federal seed
money meant to spur user fee financed infrastructure.

The proposal contains tools for scoring

prospective proposals, and the details of the scoring algorithm have not yet been made public.
The natural means of incorporating concerns about not working into that structure is to provide
extra points in the algorithm based on the number of people who can be reasonably project to
find employment as a result of the project after it is completed. Ideally, the social value of those
transitions should be denominated in dollars to make them comparable with other criteria used in
the scoring algorithm.
If Federal investment comes with no expectations for user fee financing, then there is more
scope for spatial targeting of high not working rate areas, and more risk of white elephants. At
49

this point, most legislatively mandated projects do not come with cost benefit analysis.

If such

analysis were to become regular, then it would be natural to include the social benefits of
employment into the benefits.

Even without cost-benefit analysis, the current Highway Trust

Fund Apportionment rules could incorporate non-employment effects. Such alterations to the
code would, however, require us to be certain that highway funds spent in high not working rate
areas do more to reduce not working rates than highway funds spent in other areas.
In a reformed system with better checks on waste and real cost-benefit analysis, infrastructure
could provide a tool for regional support, but without such reforms the downsides remain
significant.

Employment Subsidies, Welfare Benefits and Federal Taxes
The norm in U.S. politics is that national policies need to be uniform, even when local
heterogeneity argues strongly against such uniformity.

Housing subsidies, such as the Low

Income Housing Tax Credit, treat Detroit, Houston and San Francisco essentially identically
despite their wildly different housing costs and supply conditions.

We have tried to make the

case that labor supply elasticities are heterogeneous, and consequently one-size-fits-all
employment policies will generate less added employment than spatially differentiated
policies. Stronger employment subsidies are likely to reduce joblessness more in Eastern
Tennessee than in San Francisco.
The current Earned Income Tax credit is based on annual earnings. It phases in at low incomes
and essentially offers a proportionate increase in earnings in this region. It reaches a maximum
value, and for individuals whose earnings are in this region contingent on working, it essentially
offers a flat nominal subsidy for working. Finally, it phases out, and in this region, the Earned
Income Tax Credit acts as a deterrent on working more.
The Tax Credit can be over $6,000 for individuals with two or three children and earnings of
around $16,000.

For individuals who do not have children in their households, it represents an

extremely modest work subsidy.

However, the overwhelming preponderance of non-working

men do not have a child in their homes.
For the Earned Income Tax Credit to be more effective at spurring prime-aged male
employment, it would have to be more generous to single-person households. One option would
be to affect a straight wage subsidy, perhaps administered through the employer, which would
obviously increase the take-home pay per hour of work. One danger of that approach is that it
might engender fraud as workers and firms collude to declare that he worker had labored for
50

longer hours at lower wages.

If fraud can be effectively contained, an hourly employer-

managed wage subsidy has significant advantages in ease of administration and salience. Any
system would need a phase out region to be fiscally prudent, and in that region, the credit would
still deter work.
A flat cash wage subsidy would provide more push in high not working rate areas because
prices are lower.

The current maximum payment, which is fixed in dollar terms, already

achieves that end.

The phase in period, which increases earnings proportionally, does not.

Consequently, the move to a dollar wage subsidy, instead of a percent increase, would partially
strengthen geographic targeting. A more aggressive approach would increase the size of the
wage subsidy in distressed areas, which our estimates suggest would increase employment more
per dollar spent.
Another approach is to reduce marginal taxes for everyone living in high not working rate
areas. This approach is embodied in the 2017 tax reform, which lowers tax rates for many and
increased the standard deduction.

But it also eliminated the deductibility of state and lower

taxes. Effectively, this shift raised taxes in big government states relative to low government
states.

If local government spending on services like education has significant social value,

then this strategy has significant downsides. Yet given the negative correlation between the size
of local government and not working rates, it may also reduce the disincentive to work in areas
where not working is more endemic.
The actual tax code may be less important for deterring employment than the rules surrounding
public benefits, like SNAP assistance, Housing Vouchers and Disability Insurance.

These

benefits effectively tax employment by decreasing or disappearing entirely with higher earnings.
The implicit taxes created by these programs could be reduced in low employment regions, by
enabling people who work and earn low incomes to keep more of the benefits. Current implicit
tax rates of 30 percent could be reduced to 20 percent for example.
In this section, we focused on increasing spending in high not working rate regions, and we
recognize that this could distort migration and lead to high real estate prices.
section made clear, this can be offset if other benefits are removed from the region.

As the theory
We will not

analyze appropriate areas to cut, but theoretically, it is possible to reduce non-employment in
high not working rate regions while keeping total spending in the region constant and not
distorting migration incentives, as long as other non-employment enhancing spending is cut
back.

51

While our model suggested the value of more tailored employment policies, we are notably not
calling for local control. Localities often have strong incentives to distort migration to attract the
rich and repel the poor. Purely local control over social welfare policy could lead to a race to the
bottom where states dismantled their safety nets to get rid of their poorer residents.

Place-Based Education Reform
The data strongly supports the view that education is an extremely powerful determinant of
local success and failure.

We consequently join those who see investment in human capital as

critical for long run growth, even if that investment takes a generation or more.
But education also contains tradeoffs between providing skills that maximize future
employability and other objectives.

Liberals arts education, naturally, has never accepted pre-

professionalism, but even in high schools and community colleges, there are often a diversity of
objectives.

Those tradeoffs can be tilted towards employment in high not working rate regions.

Currently, the Federal government supports community colleges through Pell Grants and other
forms of support.

That support could be structured to provide incentives that induce those

institutions to focus more on job generating skills.

For example, community colleges could

receive bonus payments for admitting students from distressed regions, who are then employed
for some number of years post-graduation.

At the least, such a program could be tested for

impact.
We do not anticipate that such incentives will do much in the classroom.

It is difficult to

change teaching quality for classes such as remedial writing and mathematics. The more likely
impact of such an incentive program is that college administrators would begin experimenting
with counseling and promoting more employable majors.
Bartik and Erickcek’s (2014) discussion of place-based policies emphasized the possibility for
targeted training programs, which might provide skills that are in high local demand. While the
track record of adult training programs is mixed at best, we agree with Bartik that there is value
is experimenting with targeted training.

If there are fixed costs to supporting training in

particular locations, then it would make sense to have programs disproportionately in areas with
greater need and more elastic labor supply.

Final Thoughts
This paper proposed three plausible justifications for such policies: agglomeration economies,
geographic tagging of redistribution and hot spots non-employment reduction.
52

The

agglomeration case for spatial redistribution is weak, because we know too little about the exact
functional form of agglomeration economies. The case for geographic tagging of redistribution
is more plausible, but income heterogeneity within areas is much larger than heterogeneity across
areas. Moreover, capitalization effects mean that property owners are likely to reap many of the
benefits of geographically targeted policies.
The best case for geographic targeting of policies is that a dollar spent fighting nonemployment in a high not working rate area will do more to reduce non-employment than a
dollar spent fighting non-employment in a low not working rate area.

The empirical evidence

for heterogeneous labor supply responses to demand shocks or public interventions is limited,
but broadly supportive of the view that reducing the not working rate in some parts of the
country is easier than in other parts of the country.
That heterogeneity can either justify added spending in distressed, more elastic areas, or a twist
in spending that favors employment in those areas.

While infrastructure remains an important

investment for America, targeting infrastructure spending towards distressed areas risks
producing projects with limited value for users. By contrast, enhanced spending on employment
subsidies in areas with extreme joblessness, and perhaps the U.S. as a whole, seems like a more
plausible means of reducing non-employment.

Subsidizing employment seems likely to have

larger impact in the long run if it is matched with investment in work-related human capital.

Notes: Pooled 2006-2008 American Community Survey and 1990 and 2000 Census prime male respondents, excludes institutionalized individuals, members of the Armed Forces, and
individuals with missing data. Not working rates are calculated using a weighted mean at the commuting zone level. High not working commuting zones are zones in the top 10 percent of
total prime male not working rate levels in 1990. Change in trade exposure and controls at the Commuting Zone level are for the entire working population, and are drawn from Autor, Dorn,
and Hanson (2013). Commuting zones are weighted as in Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013). Robust standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered at the state level.
