ABSTRACT
Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States,
may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22
licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics
that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in
occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to
members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams
show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations
and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence
that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the
interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational
licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in
the United States.

1. Introduction
Occupational licensing has become one of the most significant forms of labor market
regulation in the United States. About 25 percent of the workforce requires a license to
work; in 1950, that figure was only 5 percent (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of
Labor Statistics 2016; Kleiner and Krueger 2010, 2013). Proponents of occupational
licensing contend that it protects consumers, ensuring high service quality and protecting
the public from harm by making sure that all service providers have attained a minimum
qualification level. By requiring such qualifications, however, occupational licensing
may also restrict entry and limit the mobility of individuals in these occupations. The
jurisdiction-specific nature of licensing also may limit the ability of workers to move to
take advantage of job opportunities, and may limit the wage growth and employment of
members of licensed occupations by restricting their geographic mobility. We provide
new and more comprehensive detailed evidence of the influence of occupational
licensing on reducing the interstate migration of licensed workers. These results suggest
that reducing some of these restrictions has the potential to enhance labor market fluidity,
increase the efficiency of the labor market, and raise the earnings of regulated workers.
Economists have long recognized the ability of workers to move to different labor
markets without restriction as fundamental to the efficient functioning of those markets
(Smith 1776; Friedman 1962). Most occupational licenses are granted at the state level, 1
and often the cost of attaining licensure in another state can be significant, even for those
already licensed in another state. If the rise in occupational licensing restricts interstate
mobility, it potentially subjects a growing share of the labor force to barriers to mobility

A White House report estimated that over 1,100 occupations are licensed in at least one state and
60 are licensed in every state (U.S. Executive Office of the President, 2015).

and subsequent wage growth. In this study, we show that individuals in a variety of
licensed occupations, ranging from high income and education professions to blue-collar
trades, move across states at a significantly lower rate than others, although the size of
this reduction varies substantially across occupations. Our empirical strategy exploits the
detailed migration information available in the American Community Survey (ACS) to
control for unobservable characteristics of licensed occupation members that influence
the probability of moving a long distance. We show that occupations with state-specific
licensing requirements, such as exams, experience the largest reductions in interstate
migration, whereas the interstate mobility of occupations requiring passage of a national
exam for licensure is generally no lower than that of others. We provide additional
evidence of a causal link between state licensing requirements to the interstate migration
of lawyers. We provide approximations of the earnings growth of licensed individuals
arising from their reduced incentives to move across states.
Despite the growing importance of occupational licensing, the existing literature
investigating the link between occupational licensing and geographic mobility is sparse.
Using data from the 1950 census, Holen (1965) showed that dentists and lawyers have
limited between-state mobility relative to physicians. Pashigian (1979) considered the
interstate migration of multiple universally licensed occupations, and occupations with
little reciprocity between states had lower interstate mobility between 1965 and 1970. In
a study of 14 universally licensed occupations also using the 1970 census, Kleiner et al.
(1982) found a negative relationship between licensing “restrictiveness” (based on state
exam and experience requirements) and interstate mobility, as well as a positive
correlation between expanded reciprocity and interstate migration rates. More recent

2

work includes Tenn (2001) and DePasquale and Stange (2016). Tenn’s dissertation
examines the links between the interstate migration of lawyers and their wages, finding
that wages are higher in states with lower migration rates. In contrast, DePasquale and
Stange show that the adoption of the Nurse Licensure Compact, which enables registered
nurses to practice across state lines without obtaining additional licensure, does not affect
the labor supply or the geographic mobility of nurses.
The growth of occupational licensing from the 1950s through 2008 is shown in
Figure 1 (Kleiner and Krueger 2013). The figure also shows the decline in gross interstate
migration rates from World War II using estimates from the Current Population Survey
(CPS) for various years. The limiting effect of occupational licensing on interstate
migration can provide insights into two yet-unexplained trends: the decrease in interstate
migration and labor market churn over the last three decades. Annual interstate migration
fell from 3 to 1.5 percent between 1980 and 2010 (Molloy et al. 2011), and annual job-tojob flows fell from 16 to 11 percent over the same time period (Molloy et al. 2016). 2 If
occupational licensing decreases interstate migration by 20 percent, as our results
suggest, the increase in licensing can account for 4 percent of the decline in interstate
migration and 1.2 percent of the decrease in job-to-job flows between 1980 and 2010.
The aging of the U.S. population, in contrast, accounts for only 10 percent of the decline
in interstate migration between 1980 and 2015 and 9 percent of the decline in job-to-job
flows between 1998 and 2010 (Molloy et al. 2016; Hyatt and Spletzer 2013).

2

Many others have also documented and investigated these trends. For more on the decline in
geographic mobility, see Molloy et al. (2013), Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2017), and Johnson and
Schulhofer-Wohl (2017). Work on the decline in labor market churn includes Abowd and Vilhuber
(2011), Bjelland et al. (2011), Davis et al. (2012), Hyatt and McEntarfer (2012), and Lazear and
Spletzer (2012).

Our study proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a simple theoretical framework
relating occupational licensing and geographic mobility. Section 3 describes our data.
Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy, and Section 5 presents our results, including
tests of the robustness of our results and the causal model for lawyers. In Section 6 we
summarize, conclude, and present directions for future research.
2. Modeling Occupational Licensing and Geographic Mobility
The potential restrictive effect of occupational licensing on interstate migration can
be modeled using classic models of migration decision making developed by Sjaastad
(1962). In these models, an individual decides whether to migrate based on expected
utility differences (usually modeled as a function of wages or trade-offs of wages for
other nonpecuniary items) between the origin and destination. They migrate if, given
their beliefs, they have a higher expected utility from migrating than from not migrating:
𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑤𝑤𝐷𝐷 )] − 𝐶𝐶 ≥ 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑤𝑤𝑂𝑂 )].

(1)

While expected utility 𝑢𝑢 is a function of wages in the origin and destination (𝑤𝑤𝑂𝑂 and 𝑤𝑤𝐷𝐷 ,

respectively), migrating also incurs a cost 𝐶𝐶. Often this cost is thought of as including
onetime moving costs, such as transportation, finding a home and job and other setup

costs incurred at the destination, as well as so-called psychic costs, such as being farther
from family, finding new friends, and so on. For moves where the origin and destination
are both within a state, members of licensed occupations incur no additional cost to
migration relative to unlicensed workers. Licensed individuals considering a move to a
destination in another state face the additional cost of re-licensure, an issue that
unlicensed individuals considering the same move do not face. If re-licensure cost is

4

high enough, the interstate migration rates of licensed individuals will be lower than that
of others, but their within-state migration rates should be unaffected.
Although the exact requirements for licensure vary by occupation, most include
training, experience, and exam obligations, as well as the payment of licensing fees and
participation in continuing professional development activities (Sass 2015). An
individual seeking re-licensure in another state may range from completing more training
and exams or merely filling out forms and paying a fee. The specific requirements vary
not only by occupation but also by destination and origin state. For particular
occupations, some states have reciprocity agreements with other states, which recognize
licenses granted in another state as valid for practice. Institutional costs are associated
with these regulations. In some cases, re-licensure costs can be high. For example, a
licensed public schoolteacher with a decade of teaching experience in New Hampshire is
not legally allowed to teach in an Illinois public school without completing significant
new coursework and apprenticeships (Sass 2015). The existence of such requirements
could constitute a significant cost to migration across state lines for those in licensed
occupations, and these costs could prevent individuals from moving if the costs of relicensure had been lower.
3. Data
For our empirical analysis, we rely on the ACS as available through IPUMS-USA
(Ruggles 2017). As the largest nationally representative survey that contains detailed
migration and occupation measures, as well as other information, the ACS is the existing
dataset most suited to studying the relationship between licensing coverage and

5

migration. 3 We use the ACS from 2005 to 2015 for our main analyses because these
years contain more detailed migration information than is available in earlier years.
Since we are interested in the migration of currently employed and employable
individuals, we limit our sample to those aged 18 to 65. The data available through the
ACS only have information on occupational licensing coverage, but not if the individual
attained a license (Gittleman and Kleiner 2016). 4
The 22 licensed occupations we examine are shown in Table 1. We chose these
occupations based on the following criteria: (1) they were uniquely identifiable using
ACS occupation codes, (2) they were universally licensed in all states, and (3) entry into
the occupation requires licensure, so all members of an occupation must be licensed. All
of these occupations require passage of at least one exam to attain licensure. We use the
structure of this exam to divide the occupations into two categories: occupations for
which the content and passing standards of the licensing exam vary across states, and
those for which the main licensing exam is a national exam with a single passing
standard. We refer to the former group as “state-specific” licensed occupations and the
latter as “quasi-national” licensed occupations. 5 Some occupations with similar tasks,
such as occupational and physical therapists, were merged by combining two or more
ACS occupation categories to increase the sample size. These 22 licensed occupations
cover a wide variety of employment types, from low to high income and education, and

The address-based sampling design of the Current Population Survey (CPS) unfortunately limits its
usefulness in studying the relationship between migration and licensing because movers are not
followed over time.
4 The ACS has a weakness of only identifying current occupation; consequently, we only observe
occupation of migrants after their move. We discuss in detail the implications of our results in Section 4.
5 More details on the rationale for classification of occupations as quasi-national and state-specific
are shown in Appendix Table A1.
3

6

across a range of industries. The occupations we analyze make up 11 percent of the U.S.
labor force, with the state-specific licensed occupations accounting for 7 percent and the
quasi-national licensed occupations for 4 percent.
We focus on occupations that are universally licensed in all states and all the
individuals in the occupation have attained a license and use it in their work to ensure that
all members of the occupation face re-licensure costs to move across states (Gittelman
and Kleiner 2016). Although many occupations, such as engineers and accountants, are
universally licensed in all states, licensure is not required to enter the occupation, and half
or less have attained a state license (Gittleman, Klee, and Kleiner, forthcoming).
Therefore, re-licensure costs do not factor in the interstate migration decision for a large
percentage of the members of these occupations. Similarly, we do not examine other
occupations such as securities brokers since they are largely licensed at the national level
and state provisions are not relevant. In addition, we do not analyze truck drivers, since a
large part of the relevance of licensing is either national or local, and state provisions are
less applicable.
4. Empirical Strategy
We estimate the relationship between being a member of a licensed occupation and
interstate migration using the following model:
𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(2)

where 𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for moving between states in the last year for individual 𝑖𝑖

residing in state 𝑠𝑠 in year 𝑡𝑡, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for being a member of a licensed

7

occupation, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of control variables, 6 and 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 are state-year fixed effects.

The comparison group in our model contains members of all other occupations regardless
of licensure status. 7 The estimate of our coefficient of interest, 𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 , likely does not identify
our parameter of interest, the effect of the cost of re-licensure on interstate migration, due
to the presence of correlations between 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and the error term 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Fortunately,
we can address this selection bias problem by using the detailed migration information
available in the ACS.
Starting in 2005, the ACS contains detailed information for migrants on current and
previous locations at geographies below the state level, known as Public Use Microdata
Areas of migration (MIGPUMAs). These geographic units correspond to areas with
roughly 100,000 or more residents and are defined separately within each state. 8 We use
this current and former MIGPUMA of residence information to define two types of
migrants for those who move within a state: those who move within the same
MIGPUMA or between adjacent MIGPUMAs (defined as MIGPUMAs who share a
border) and those who move between non-adjacent MIGPUMAs. We refer to the former
group of within-state migrants as “close” migrants and the latter as “far” migrants.

6

These variables include measures of education (less than high school, high school graduate, some
college, bachelor’s degree, more than a bachelor’s degree), race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic white, and other race), sex, marital status (married, divorced, widowed, never
married), age (5-year categories with a separate category for ages 18 and 19), citizenship status,
employment status (employed, unemployed, not in labor force), and number of children. We also
control for income quartile (measured in 2015 dollars), with the quartiles calculated for each
occupation separately, and those with incomes greater than the maximum reported from each
occupation excluded from estimations for that occupation (or occupation type).
7 The presence of licensed occupations in our comparison group biases our estimate of 𝛿𝛿 towards
𝐵𝐵
zero, as some of the members of the comparison group are also licensed. These are members of
licensed occupations not identifiable in the ACS.
8 Some MIGPUMAs combine two or more Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) of residence, so the
two do not perfectly correspond. For more information, see https://usa.ipums.org/usaaction/variables/MIGPUMA1#description_section.

8

Annual close, far, and interstate migration rates for our sample, as well as selected
descriptive statistics, are shown in Table 2. Note that the majority of moves are close,
since approximately 11.5 percent of the population moves within states in a given year,
compared to 2.5 percent moving between states and 1 percent moving a far distance
within a state.
Far moves made within a state are likely to be more similar to interstate moves than
close moves. Individuals moving within the same MIGPUMA or between adjacent
MIGPUMAs are likely to keep the same employer and job after the move, since they are
moving within the same local area; these moves are more likely motivated by reasons
other than employment. Moving a farther distance, whether it is within the same state or
between states, is more likely to be accompanied by a change in employer. To illustrate
how the similarity between far within-state and interstate moves allows us to address the
selection problem in equation (2), consider the corresponding equation for far moves:
𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(3)

where 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is now an indicator for moving far within a state, and all other variables are

defined as in equation .2. Similarly, we expect 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) ≠ 0, and therefore
our estimate 𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 , to also suffer from selection bias. However, as members of licensed

occupations do not need to become re-licensed when they move within a state, 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 = 0.

Therefore, 𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 identifies the bias resulting from correlation between the probability of

making a far move and being a member of a licensed occupation. Consider the following
expression for the error term 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 :

𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,
9

(4)

where 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 captures unobserved characteristics correlated with licensure status that affect
the probability of moving at all, regardless of distance. The 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 term represents

characteristics affecting the likelihood of moving a far distance, whether within or
between states, that are correlated with being in a licensed occupation. Licensed
occupations, such as lawyers, realtors, barbers and cosmetologists, and many health care
related occupations, are likely to have a “practice” or “network” component, and
consequently success in these occupations involves development of reputation capital or
clientele in one’s local area. Moving away from these customers results in loss of this
local capital and development of similar capital in the destination area, which requires a
significant investment of time and money. The additional reputation- or network-related
cost likely deters members of licensed occupations from moving far distances and is
unrelated to the cost of licensure itself. If we assume 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0, the
expectation of 𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 is

𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � = 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ),

(5)

where 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (∙) is the bias resulting from that component. Note that both 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
are also components of the error term in the interstate migration equation,
𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(6)

as they also influence the probability of moving between states. Therefore, we have this
expression for 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � if we also assume 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶(𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 0:
𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � = 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ),

(7)

and 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � − 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � identifies 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 if 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐵𝐵 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) =
𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝐹𝐹 (𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). Each of these bias terms contains three elements: (1) the correlation

between the component and the dependent variable, (2) the correlation between the
10

component and 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and (3) the correlation between the component and the other

variables in the equation. As the right-hand side of each equation is specified identically,
(2) and (3) are plausibly true. Recall that we defined 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 to be unobserved characteristics
correlated with licensing status affecting the probability of moving at all, and so its
relationship with the dependent variable in both equations (moving far or moving
between states) should be similar. The other component 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 represents characteristics of
licensed occupations that affect the probability of moving a long distance, and so its

relationship with moving far or moving between states should be identical. Therefore, it
is plausible that the bias from each term should be approximately equal in both the far
and interstate equations.
In addition to the assumptions discussed above, the ability of the “difference”
estimator 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � − 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � to identify 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 also relies on the additional assumptions of no

correlation between 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and the remaining parts of each error term (𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and

𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). These assumptions are likely to not hold, as there are potentially other unobserved

factors correlated with licensing status that affect the likelihood of migration, whether

between states or within a state, that are not captured by 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 . We therefore do
not claim that 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � − 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � identifies a causal effect of licensure on interstate

migration, but this difference estimator is likely “closer” to this effect than the estimate of
𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 in equation (2).

We face an additional issue in estimating the effect of re-licensure costs on interstate

migration from the content of the ACS dataset. Our key independent variable
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is defined based on current reported occupation, and our dependent variables
are measures of migration in the past year. The ACS does not contain information on an
11

individual’s occupation last year (i.e., prior to their move). Therefore, individuals
currently in licensed occupations in the ACS consist of two groups: individuals who were
also employed in that occupation last year (“continuing” members of the occupation) and
individuals who were not (“new entrants” into the occupation). Therefore, 𝛿𝛿𝐵𝐵 and 𝛿𝛿𝐹𝐹 do

not solely identify the effect of re-licensure cost on migration (as they would if we could
condition on last year’s occupation), but instead are a combination of this effect (the
difference in migration rates between continuing members of licensed occupations and
other occupations) and the difference in migration rates between new entrants into
licensed occupations and new entrants into other occupations.
We have previously described the predicted relationship between re-licensure costs
and migration rates of continuing members of occupations: continuing members only
face re-licensure costs if they move between states. We then ask, what is the relationship
between licensure costs and migration rates for new entrants into occupations? All new
entrants into licensed occupations face initial licensure costs, whether they stay where
they are currently living or move. If initial licensure costs vary across states, new
entrants into licensed occupations have an incentive to move to states with lower
licensure costs. Relative licensure costs between states are not a factor in the migration
decisions of unlicensed occupations.
Assuming that other incentives to migrate for new entrants operate similarly across
licensed and unlicensed occupations (and/or differences in these incentives are effectively
“differenced out” using the between–far difference estimator), we expect new entrants in
licensed occupations to have higher interstate migration rates relative to new entrants in
unlicensed occupations, as they have a stronger incentive to move across states because

12

of varying initial licensure costs, but this difference in incentives does not exist for
within-state moves. This means our estimate of the effect of licensure on interstate
migration is a combination of a negative effect for continuing members of licensed
occupations and a positive effect for new entrants. Therefore, our estimator 𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐵𝐵 � −
𝐸𝐸�𝛿𝛿̂𝐹𝐹 � is biased upward by the presence of new entrants in our sample.

We can provide some suggestive evidence on the size and presence of this bias by

using data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population
Survey (CPS ASEC). While not a panel dataset, the ASEC records both the current
occupation of individuals as well as their occupation one year ago. As the data contains
the occupation before and after a move for those who moved in the last year, we can
identify new entrants into occupations as well as continuing members, and therefore
calculate the fraction of new entrants into occupations by their migration status. The
CPS migration question allows us to distinguish three types of migration for those who
moved: moves within a county, moves between counties within the same state, and
moves between states.
Table 3 shows the fraction new entrants into our three main license categories: all
licensed occupations, state-specific licensed occupations, and quasi-nationally licensed
occupations, 9 by their migration status in the last year. For all three occupation
categories, individuals who moved between states have the highest fraction of new
entrants, followed by individuals who moved between counties within a state. 10 The fact

All 22 occupations we use in the ACS are also identifiable in the CPS ASEC.
It is not surprising that a large fraction of interstate migrants are new entrants into occupations,
given that the most commonly cited reason for far-distance moves is a job change, and migration is
highest among young people who are likely to be at the beginning of their careers (Molloy et al. 2011,
2013).

that interstate migrants currently employed in a licensed occupation are 3.6 percentage
points (about 25 percent) more likely to be new entrants than those who move between
counties within a state suggests that the upward bias in our estimates is potentially quite
significant. 11 However, the difference in the relative fraction of new entrants among
interstate migrants is similar between quasi-nationally and state-specific licensed
occupations, making it quite likely that results for the two categories are equally affected
by this bias. 12
5. Results
We estimate our difference estimator E�δ�B � − E�δ�F � by simultaneously estimating

models (2) and (3), clustering our standard errors on last year’s state of residence. As we
use linear probability models, the coefficients are percentage point changes, which are
not directly comparable across the two models because of differences in the mean of the
dependent variable (only about 1 percent of the population moves far within a state,
whereas approximately 3 percent of the population moves between states within a year).
We therefore convert our estimates to percentage effects by dividing them by the
estimated value of the constant in their respective model and multiplying by 100, and we
use the simultaneous estimation to calculate standard errors. We first estimate our model
for all licensed occupations and the two licensed occupation groups (state-specific and
quasi-national) and provide evidence that our results are robust to changes in the
definition of far moves. We then explore the heterogeneity in effects across occupations

11 We performed a similar analysis using the 2001, 2004, and 2008 panels of the Survey of Income
and Program Participation, and results were consistent with our CPS findings, and are available in
Appendix Table A2.
12 The sample size in the CPS ASEC is much smaller than the ACS, which is why we do not employ
more sophisticated statistical techniques to examine this difference, or repeat our analysis by
occupation.

14

and show more direct links between licensing policies and the interstate migration of
lawyers.
5.1 Results by licensing group
Our main results are shown in Table 4. We provide the estimate of the difference
estimator E�δ�B � − E�δ�F � as well as the estimates of its two components. Results are
shown for four different specifications. Column (1) compares the migration rates of

members of all 22 licensed occupations to that of others, finding that individuals in these
occupations have between-state migration rates that are 22.5 percent lower than their far
within-state migration rate relative to members of other occupations. This difference is
driven by their lower between-state migration rate, as their far within-state rate is similar
to that of other occupations. Columns (2) and (3) repeat the analysis for the state-specific
licensed occupations and the quasi-national licensed occupations, respectively. The
results are very different for the two different groups: the relative interstate migration rate
of state-specific licensed occupations is 36 percent lower than that of others, whereas that
of quasi-national licensed occupations is 5 percent higher. A more direct comparison of
the two groups is shown in Column (4), which compares state-licensed occupations to
quasi-national licensed occupations (i.e., the “treatment” group is state-licensed
occupations, and the comparison group is quasi-national occupations, with others
excluded from the sample). In this case, all members of the sample are subject to
occupational licensing, but individuals in licensed occupations with state-specific exam
requirements move at a 31 percent lower rate between states than those with national
exams. However, they also move far within a state at a 15 percent lower rate, which is
evidence that clientele and network-based aspects of these occupations may play a

15

significant role in limiting migration of these occupations out of their local area. After
accounting for these estimates, the relative migration rates of state-specific licensed
occupations between states are still 16 percent lower than those of quasi-national licensed
occupations.
5.2 Robustness to MIGPUMA definitions
The ability of our estimation strategy to identify the effect of licensing on interstate
migration relies on our measure of far within-state migration (moving between nonadjacent MIGPUMAs within a state) being a good proxy for a move that corresponds
with both a job change and a move out of one’s local area. To implement a robustness
check for how sensitive our results are to the definition of a MIGPUMA, we exploit the
fact that these definitions changed as a result of the 2010 census.
The definition of MIGPUMAs in the ACS changed in 2012. The extent of these
changes varied substantially across states: some states saw no change from the pre-2012
definition, whereas others saw the number of MIGPUMAs within their state decrease
substantially. To ensure that our results are not driven by these changes, we repeat our
analysis for the time periods with consistent MIGPUMA definitions: 2005–2011 and
2012–2015. Results are shown in Panels A and B of Table 5. Results are similar across
the two periods, although in the later period there is no significant difference in relative
between-state migration rates for quasi-national occupations. It is, therefore, unlikely
that our results are affected by the change in MIGPUMA definition, and our measure of
far migration within a state (moving between non-adjacent MIGPUMAs) performs
equally well in being a proxy for a “far” move under both definitions.

16

Another threat to our empirical strategy is if some movements between states do not
result in changing the state of licensure of an individual. For example, individuals who
are licensed and working in New York may move to Connecticut while keeping their job
and license in New York. These types of moves are most likely to occur in the Northeast
census region, where states are small and metropolitan areas often cross many state
borders. 13 We therefore repeat our analysis excluding individuals currently residing in
this region or who did a year ago. Results are shown in Panel C of Table 5 and are very
similar to our main results in Table 4. Our results appear unaffected by the unique
geography of states in the Northeast region. 14
5.3 Occupation-specific analysis
As state requirements for licensure are unique to each occupation, we expect
substantial variation in the effects of licensure on interstate migration across occupations,
even within the state-specific and quasi-national categories, especially as these
classifications are based on only the exam requirement. We investigate the heterogeneity
across occupations in the effect of licensing on interstate migration by repeating our
analysis separately for the 22 occupations listed in Table 1. In these specifications, the
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicator is replaced by an indicator for belonging to one of the listed

occupations (i.e., 𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , etc.). In some of the specifications, we also set a

minimum education, as many occupations require a minimum education level to enter.

13 The Northeast census region contains the New England division (Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and the Mid-Atlantic division (New
Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania).
14 States in the Northeast region were also the most affected by the MIGPUMA definition change in
2012. For example, Massachusetts had many small MIGPUMAs in the pre-2011 definition, and after
the change in 2012, the entire eastern half of the state was combined into one MIGPUMA. As results
excluding the Northeast are nearly identical to results using the entire country, this is further
evidence that our results are not sensitive to MIGPUMA definitions.

17

For example, we limit the sample for the physician education level to those with at least a
bachelor’s degree, since including those with lower education levels in the comparison
group for such a highly educated profession are likely errors in the data. 15 All other
control variables are the same as in our main analysis.
Results for the state-specific licensed occupations are shown in Table 6. There are
large differences across occupations in the relative between-state migration rate.
Pharmacists and teachers have the lowest relative rates, at -47 and -39 percent,
respectively. 16 Other occupations with reduced relative interstate migration include
lawyers (-25 percent), real estate appraisers and brokers (-21 and -13 percent,
respectively), electricians (-13 percent), and barbers/cosmetologists (-7.5 percent). The
other occupations—insurance agents, EMTs/paramedics, pest control workers, and
chiropractors—display no statistically significant difference in their relative betweenstate migration rates compared to members of other occupations, although their point
estimates are all less than zero. Our results also show that occupations for which network
and clientele effects are expected to be important also have lower far within-state
migration rates, such as teachers, barbers/cosmetologists, and real estate brokers and
appraisers. 17

15 Minimum education levels for each occupation’s specification, if applicable, are listed in the notes

to Tables 6 and 7.
In many states, only teachers employed by public schools have to be licensed. Unfortunately, the
industry and occupation codes in the ACS do not allow distinction of public school teachers from
other teachers. Our estimate of the effect of licensing on migration of teachers is therefore likely to
be upwardly biased, as the migration decisions of private school teachers should not be affected by
licensing.
17 The lower far migration rate for teachers is likely not a result of a network or clientele effect, but
instead likely a result of the loss of benefits specific to school districts, such as tenure, pensions, and
seniority within union contracts. Perhaps surprising is the fact that lawyers appear to not suffer
from this clientele effect, as they move at a higher rate and far distance within the state. However,
many lawyers work for corporations, as public defendants, or district attorneys, or they work for
large law firms, where development of a local clientele and network is less important.
16

18

Table 7 shows the results for the quasi-national licensed occupations for the period
2005–2015. Here again, we see large differences across occupations. Nurses and
physicians move at a relatively higher rate between states than those in other occupations,
and there are no significant differences in migration rates for most other occupations,
consistent with state licensing requirements not affecting the migration of these
occupations with national licensing exams. However, three occupations stand out as
showing substantially limited interstate migration, at a level comparable to lawyers:
social workers, dental hygienists, and dentists. Why would their interstate migration
rates be lower if their licensing is based on a national exam? Social workers do have a
national exam but no system of reciprocity between states, and many states require
additional state-specific courses for licensure. 18 Although their main written licensing
exam is national, dentists and dental hygienists must also pass a clinical exam. Several
clinical exams are offered by regional organizations, and not all are accepted by all the
other states for licensure. A few states, such as California and Delaware, have a statespecific clinical exam. For these three occupations, these state-specific training
requirements and differences in accepted clinical exams likely explain their reduced
interstate migration.
Our results strongly suggest that state-specific requirements for occupational
licensing limit the ability of individuals in affected occupations to move between states,
but the interstate migration of licensed occupations with more nationally standardized
requirements is not influenced by state licensure. However, despite the use of our

differences estimator to remove the influence of unobservable characteristics correlated
with migration and licensure, they do not prove that this relationship is causal.
Fortunately, we do have information on potential exogenous variation for one occupation
in our sample that we can use to implement a causal model.
5.4 Additional evidence from lawyers
Ideally, we would have information on historical changes in state requirements for relicensure for all of our licensed occupations—information that would enable a causal
analysis. Unfortunately, this information is not available for most occupations. States
have broad discretion to set their own licensing requirements for each occupation, and
often the specifics are delegated to a licensing board.
One exception is lawyers. Unlike many other occupations, lawyers have a large
national association, the American Bar Association (ABA), and a national organization,
the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), both of which oversee a major
component of lawyer licensure: the bar exam. The websites for these two entities provide
current information on state licensing requirements and a listing of ABA-accredited law
schools, as well as historic information for the last 5–15 years.
One aspect of lawyer licensure for which we have information is reciprocity
agreements. Entering into reciprocity agreements, which accept individuals holding
licenses in specific other states as qualified to practice with few or no additional
requirements, is one way that states can lower the barriers to re-licensure. The licensing
guides published by the NCBE provide the year in which states entered into reciprocity
agreements for the first time for lawyers, but we only have information about the member
states of each agreement starting in 2015. We use this information, as well as information

20

on the difficulty of each state’s bar exam, to draw a more concrete link between the
limited between-state migration of lawyers and licensing requirements.
5.4.1 Lawyer reciprocity and between-state migration
Ten states adopted reciprocity agreements for lawyers between 2001 and 2015. As of
2015, 7 states had no such agreement, and the remaining 34 states already had reciprocity
agreements in place in 2001. The introduction of reciprocity potentially increases the
ability of lawyers to migrate to a state, as the barriers to re-licensure are much lower. We
test whether this is the case using the following specification:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾1 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 ×
𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
(8)

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for moving between states in the last year for individual 𝑖𝑖

residing in state 𝑠𝑠 in year 𝑡𝑡, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for being a lawyer, 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is

an indicator for having a reciprocity agreement in place, and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 × 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 , and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are as
in equation (2). The adoption of a reciprocity agreement for lawyers should only affect

the migration of lawyers, so 𝛿𝛿 is the key coefficient of interest. We use this differencein-difference (DID) strategy to examine both in-migration and out-migration of lawyers
to and from states that adopt reciprocity agreements. In-migration specifications define
the reciprocity variable using the current state of residence, and out-migration uses last
year’s state of residence. We repeat the analysis for three different control samples: all
individuals with at least a bachelor’s degree (the sample used in the main analysis), as
well as all licensed individuals (defined using members of the 22 occupations in Table 1)
and state-specific licensed individuals with this minimum level of education. As these
individuals also face a potential barrier to migration from licensing, they are likely a
more appropriate comparison group for lawyers.
21

Results are shown in Table 8. The in-migration of lawyers increases by 0.004
percentage points after the introduction of a reciprocity agreement, approximately 15
percent relative to all licensed individuals and 20 percent relative to state-specific
licensed individuals. In the out-migration specifications, none of the coefficients are
significant, although the point estimates on the migration of lawyers after the introduction
of reciprocity are positive using the licensed and state-specific licensed samples. The
lower half of Table 8 shows the results of tests of differences in pre-trends between the
migration rates of lawyers and the comparison group in the three years prior to the
adoption of a reciprocity agreement. The p-value for the test of joint significance for
these three coefficients is not above conventional thresholds for statistical significance,
indicating no difference in pre-trends for the two groups in all three specifications.
The in-migration of lawyers increases into states that adopt reciprocity agreements
relative to that of other licensed occupations, but there is little evidence of an effect on
out-migration of members of that occupation.
5.4.2 Difficulty of re-licensure: the bar exam
One of the major components of lawyer licensure is the bar exam. All lawyers must
pass this state-specific exam, and the content and difficulty vary significantly across
states. To investigate whether the difficulty of a state’s bar exam is related to the
movement of lawyers, we use information from the American Bar Association on ABAapproved law schools’ median LSAT scores (the law school entrance exam) and state bar
passage rates to form a state “bar difficulty index.” We form this index by regressing bar
passage rates on school median LSAT scores and year and state fixed effects using data
from 2011 to 2015, the only years available, weighted by the number of bar takers from

22

each school. The index is expressed in standard deviation units, ranging from -3.13
(Alaska) to 2.18 (California).
Bar exam difficulty should only affect the migration of lawyers who must take it to
become licensed in that state. As mentioned in the previous section, by 2015 all but
seven states have some form of reciprocity agreement in place for lawyers. The existence
of these agreements means that not all lawyers licensed elsewhere have to take a state’s
bar exam to become licensed. To qualify for licensure under these agreements, lawyers
have to be licensed in a particular state and have been practicing lawyers for a minimum
number of years (usually three out of the last five, five of the last seven, or similar
requirements). Using the member states of current reciprocity agreements and practice
requirements from a guide published by the ABA and NCBE, we identify individuals
who likely must take a state’s bar exam for licensure using the current and last year’s
state of residence and age. 19

We therefore limit our sample to include only lawyers and

explore the relationship between our index and the migration of lawyers using the
following specification:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾1 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑠𝑠 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 +
𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , (9)
where 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for likely having to take the bar for licensure in

that state, 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑠𝑠 is our bar difficulty index, and other variables are the same as in
equation (2). As we have no time variation in the bar index, 20 we cannot include state

19 We use the median age of law school graduation reported by the ABA (26) and make the
assumption that a law school graduate has practiced every year since graduation. So to satisfy a
three of the last five years requirement, we assume an individual must be at least 29 years old. We
also use information on the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE), which has been adopted by 18 states since its
introduction in 2011.
20 Indices computed using individual years of data varied greatly from year to year (while relative bar
difficulty likely does not) because of the small number of observations for many states—hence our
creation of only one index from five years of data.

23

fixed effects in our specification. Our coefficient of interest is 𝛿𝛿, which measures the

effect of bar exam difficulty on the migration of lawyers who likely have to take the bar
exam for licensure relative to lawyers who likely do not.
Results are shown in Table 9. Using all states, we see that increasing bar exam
difficulty by one standard deviation is associated with 1.2 percentage point lower inmigration and 2.5 percentage points lower out-migration rates of lawyers who likely must
take the bar relative to lawyers who likely do not. This is a very large relative effect:
approximately a 40 percent reduction in in-migration rates and 90 percent in outmigration rates. However, it is common knowledge among lawyers that the California
bar exam is notoriously difficult, with about a 50 percent pass rate over time. To see
whether our results are driven by California’s statistics, we exclude the state from the
sample and re-estimate our model. Indeed, the coefficient on the interaction between the
bar index and likely having to take the bar is no longer significant once we exclude
California, although the point estimate remains negative. This pattern remains the same
when we change our measure of bar exam difficulty to an indicator for having a bar exam
in the top five most difficult according to our index.21 California’s difficult bar exam
appears to deter both migration into and out of the state, but we cannot conclude that bar
exam difficulty is related to interstate migration in other states (Tenn 2001).
Results using reciprocity and bar exam measures show that adopting reciprocity
increases the migration of lawyers into a state, and state bar exam difficulty negatively
predicts in- and out-migration of lawyers relative to those in other occupations, at least in
California. However, these results are not conclusive. The reciprocity results have

Hawaii.
21

24

modest statistical significance, and the lack of a time dimension in our bar exam index
limits its causal interpretation. In any case, the results only provide evidence linking state
licensure and migration for a single occupation. Despite these limitations, they do
provide evidence that the reduced interstate migration rates experienced by state-specific
licensed occupations are likely tied to the high cost of re-licensure.
5.5 Potential Economic Consequences
Occupational licensing’s limiting effect on interstate migration has potential
implications for the earnings growth of individuals in licensed occupations, and the rise
of this form of labor market regulation may explain part of the decrease in interstate
migration and job transitions since 1980. To gauge the size of these effects, we perform
some simulations using our estimates, and the results are shown in Tables 10 and 11.
Table 10 shows that if licensing reduces the interstate migration of licensed relative to
unlicensed individuals by 20 percent (approximately the median reduction for the statespecific licensed occupations we study), the number of annual interstate migrants is
reduced by 93,600. Moreover, as these individuals do not experience the additional 10
percent earnings growth from changing jobs (Topel and Ward 1992), 22 their total annual
earnings is reduced by $356 million. Table 10 also shows this value for 10 percent and
40 percent reductions in migration for licensed individuals, which lead to annual earnings
losses of $178 million and $711 million, respectively.
Table 11 reports simulations of the fraction of the decline in interstate migration and
job-to-job flows arising from the increase in occupational licensing using our estimates.
Panel A shows the annual interstate migration rate and rate of job-to-job transitions in

22

We assume all interstate migrants experience a job-to-job transition.

25

1980 and 2015, as well as the fraction of the workforce licensed in each year. We make
two simplifying assumptions in our calculations. First, we assume there was no change
in the relative interstate migration rate between licensed and unlicensed individuals over
this time period. Second, we assume every interstate move results in a change of job. As
shown in Panel B of Table 11, if licensing reduces the interstate migration of licensed
relative to unlicensed individuals by 20 percent, the increase in occupational licensing
from 15 percent of the labor force in 1980 to 30 percent in 2015 explains 6 percent of the
decline in interstate migration and 2 percent of the decline in job-to-job flows over this
time period. These numbers are 3 and 1 percent and 13 and 4 percent if we assume
migration rates of licensed workers are 10 and 40 percent lower than those of unlicensed
workers, respectively. To put these values in context, others have shown that the aging of
the U.S. population over the same time period explains only 10 percent of the decline in
interstate migration over the same time period and 9 percent of the decline in job-to-job
flows between 1998 and 2010 (Molloy et al. 2016; Hyatt and Spletzer 2013).
6. Conclusion
We examined to what extent occupational licensing may be a contributing factor to
the general decline in interstate migration. We compared the relative within- and
between-state migration rates of members of 22 licensed occupations to those of others
using data from the American Community Survey. Our empirical strategy compared the
relationship between licensure and migration between states and a far distance within
state, which controls for unobservable characteristics that influence the propensity of
licensed occupations to move out of their local area. First, we found that migration across
states for licensed individuals is reduced, but the size of the reduction varies across

26

occupations. Quasi-nationally licensed occupations do not show any limitations on their
interstate geographic mobility. Second, using a causal model with reciprocity agreements
for lawyers, we find evidence that the adoption of these agreements increases the
migration of lawyers into a state.
Economists have long held that restrictions on geographic mobility limit the ability of
the labor market to operate efficiently. Within this context, occupational licensing
provisions that restrict job entry through interstate migration could also be a barrier to
economic opportunity and labor market efficiency. Specifically, the paper has
empirically examined whether occupational licensing statutes limiting occupational entry
from other states influence interstate migration.
The results of our estimates have implications for public policy and law. For example,
in 1941, the U.S. Supreme Court held against a California statute, making it illegal to
restrict indigent individuals from migrating to the state during the Great Depression. 23
The Court ruled that the California statute “prevent[ed] a citizen because he was poor
from seeking new horizons in other States (Roback 1943). In this way, limits on
occupational entry might essentially withhold the ability to migrate from large segments
of the population.
Our analysis examines the migration of individuals. For many, migration is not an
individual decision; instead, it is a choice made on the basis of overall household or
family well-being. As our analysis is limited to the individuals we observe in an
occupation after their move, we miss a potentially important effect of licensure on those
making interstate moves: individuals who are forced out of an occupation or out of the

23

27

labor force entirely as a result of moving between states. An example is so-called trailing
spouses—those who move because their partner obtains a better job in another state. And
if these spouses were in a licensed occupation prior to the move, they may have to switch
careers as a result. The effect of licensure on career changes or labor force exits made as
a result of household migration is potentially important, and because we cannot identify
individuals affected by these phenomena in the ACS, we leave their analysis for future
research.
While our main empirical strategy helps control for unobservable differences driving
migration patterns, we can only provide causal evidence using differences in state
licensing policy for one occupation. As additional statutory data on licensing become
available, researchers should develop additional causal models between the changes in
occupational licensing statutes and its influence on interstate migration for additional
occupations.

in past year. All specifications include state and year fixed effects, linear state-specific trends, and controls for
income, race, sex, education, marital status, age, citizenship status, employment status, and number of children. Inmigration specifications use reciprocity status of current state of residence; out-migration specifications use that of
last year's state. Sample limited to individuals with at least a bachelor's degree in all specifications; Licensed
individual and state licensed specifications limit sample further to members of the 22 licensed and 11 state-specific
occupations used in the main analysis, respectively.

Note: Standard errors clustered on state in parentheses. Dependent variable is
indicator for moving between states in past year. All specifications include year fixed
effects and controls for income, race, sex, education, marital status, age, citizenship
status, employment status, and number of children. In-migration specifications use bar
exam difficulty of current state of residence; out-migration specifications use that of
last year's state. Sample limited to individuals with at least a bachelor's degree in all
specifications. "Must take bar" is indicator for likely not being covered by a
reciprocity agreement. Bar difficulty measure formed from regression of school-level
2011-2015 bar passage rates on median LSAT score and state and year fixed effects,
weighted by total number of bar takers.

Note: "Lost" licensed interstate migrants are the number of individuals who
would have migrated if licensed individuals migrated at the same rate as
unlicensed individuals. "Lost" earnings are the total additional annual
earnings growth they would have experienced as a result of this move. We
assume all interstate migrants change jobs. Calculations use U.S.
workforce size of 104 million (calculated using 2015 ACS data), median
individual annual earnings of $38,000 (also from the ACS), occupational
licensing rate of 30% (Kleiner and Krueger 2010), annual interstate
migration rate of 1.5% (Molloy et al. 2016), and an additional earnings gain
of 10% for job changers (Topel and Ward 1992).

Note: We assume no change in the effect of licensing on interstate migration between 1980 and 2015, and every move between states
results in a job-to-job transition. Calculations as follows: Column (2) is 0.03/(0.85+0.15(1-column (1)/100), as population total migration
rate must be (weighted) average of licensed and unlicensed migration rates. Column (3) is 0.7*column 2 + 0.3*((1-column
1/100)*column 2), assuming no other change in migration rates between 1980 and 2015. Column 4 is (0.03-column 3)/0.015, as actual
decline in interstate migraiton was 0.015 between 1980 and 2015. Column 5 is (0.03-column 3)/0.05, as actual decline in job to job
flows was 0.05 between 1980 and 2015.
