DO THE BENEFITS OF FIXED EXCHANGE RATES OUTWEIGH THEIR COSTS?
THE FRANC ZONE IN AFRICA

ABSTRACT
We develop a simple formal framework to clarify the trade-offs
involved in the choice between a fixed and flexible exchange-rate

system. We then apply the framework to the CFA Zone countries in
Africa, which have maintained a fixed parity with the French Franc

since independence. Thanks to the predominance of a few agricultural
products and natural resources in their exports, CFA member countries

have suffered frequent shocks in their terms of trade. A flexible
exchange rate could have possibly alleviated the costs of these

external shocks. On the other hand, CFA member countries have managed
to maintain lower inflation levels than their neighbors. Our
framework provides a way of weighing these costs and benefits.

The inflation differential between CFA and non-CFA African

countries has been around 14 percentage points. We attribute this
differential to the standard time-consistency problem inherent in

discretionary macroeconomic policy. Nonetheless, our highly stylized
calculations suggest that fixed exchange rates have been, on the

whole, a bad bargain for the CFA member countries. Under reasonable
output-inflation tradeoffs, the output costs of maintaining a fixed
exchange rate have outweighed the benefits of lower inflation.

DO THE BENEFITS OF FIXED EXCHANGE RATES OUTWEIGH THEIR COSTS?

THE FRANC ZONE IN AFRICA

Shantayanan Devarajan and Dani Rodrik
A primary reason for structural adjustment in agriculture is the wide

fluctuation in the world prices of agricultural commodities, which

cause sharp

swings in the terms of trade of countries that rely on these commodities for

their export earnings. A key instrument in structural adjustment is the
exchange rate. How and whether this instrument is used, however, depends

paper addresses the question of how small, open economies

are subject to sharp swings in their terms

trade should select an

appropriate exchange rate regime. We develop a framework to clarify the
trade-offs involved, and apply it to the CFA Zone countries in Africa, which
have maintained a fixed parity with the French Franc since independence.
Thanks to the predominance of a few agricultural products and natural
resources in their exports, CFA member countries have suffered frequent shocks

in their terms of trade. A flexible exchange rate could have

possibly

alleviated the output costs of these external shocks. On the other hand, a
fixed exchange rate has enabled these countries to maintain lower inflation

levels than their neighbors. Our framework provides a way of weighing these
costs and benefits. Using our model as a guide, we investigate whether their
choice of a fixed exchange rate was (and remains) a wise one.
I. The Issues
The selection of an appropriate exchange-tate regime has aroused
considerable academic interest over the last three decades, and the answers

provided have shifted with academic fashions.1 Throughout much of the l9SOs

-2-

and l960s, in line with prevailing wisdom

(and practice) in the international

monetary system as a whole, developing countries

maintained fixed exchange

rates. More flexible arrangements started
to become commonplace by the late

1960s and l970s. As the currencies of
vis-a-vjs each other after 1971,

industrial countries started to float

flexibility became a necessity: pegging to

any of the major currencies implied floating against others.

During the

l980s, exchange-rate flexibility continued to gain ground among develoçing

countries. In particular, many governments experimented with market-based
exchange rate regimes, such as auction-based

systems, interbank markets, or

pure floats.

But by the mid-1980s, the tide turned.
lose much of their lustre in the

Floating exchange rates began to

eyes of industrial-country policy makers.

The wide gyrations of the dollar during the l9BOs and the short-term
volatility of the key currencies eroded confidence in markets'
foster adjustment with no (or little)

ability to

tears. The Europeans linked their

currencies tighter, and proposals to limit flexibility became widespread. In
many parts of the developing world, exchange-rate flexibility became another

name for inflation. In Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina,

Mexico, Israel and Poland,

governments introduced stabilization programs based on fixed exchange rates.
There are basically two ways of looking at exchange rates, with divergent
implications for desirable exchange rate regimes.

Borrowing Corden's (1990)

terminology, we can call these the "real targets" approach and the

"nominal

anchor" approach. The real targets school views the exchange rate as an
indispensable policy instrument in attaining equilibrium in the "real"

-3-

economy, such as in domestic activity, the current account, or the rate of

growth. This is the view of the exchange rate embedded in the textbook
exposition of the dependent economy model with its juxtaposition of
expenditure switching (i.e., devaluation) and expenditure changing (i.e.,
fiscal policy) as the two independent policies needed to achieve the twin

goals of internal and external balance. The real targets approach inevitably
leads to an activist, discretionary stance. The exchange rate has to be
managed flexibly: the authorities need to respond to external shocks (such as
terms of trade changes) or domestic price shocks by undertaking the requisite
combination of expenditure-switching (i.e., exchange rate) and expenditurechanging policies to reattain macroeconomic equilibrium.
Implicit in the real targets approach are two

notions:

macroeconomy cannot be relied on to generate on its own

first1 that the

the j exchange rate

changes required by shocks to the system; second, that a nominal devaluation
will have real effects (i.e., it will lead to a depreciation of the the real

exchange rate), at least in the short- to medium-run. These two

notions

of

how the economy works are encapsulated in the textbook model by the assumption
that home-good prices are rigid (upward as well as downward). Putting the two
together, we obtain the activist role for the exchange rate called for by the
real targets approach.

The alternative, nominal anchor approach is based on a rejection of the

efficacy of nominal exchange rate adjustments. The case for this approach can
be constructed at several levels. At the simplest level, one can deny the
effectiveness of nominal devaluations in achieving real depreciations, thereby

-4-

denying flexibility of the currency any serious economic purpose. But even if
it is granted that nominal exchange rate policy has some power in the shortto medium-run, it is possible to argue that the

inflationary costs are high

enough to render it a bad bargain. The passthrough from the
domestic prices arises from the openness of the

exchange rate to

economy and/or from the

effective indexing of home goods prices to the value of the currency. When
the pass through coefficient is below unity but high, nominal exchange rate

changes large enough to be "effective" in the sense of the real
approach will come at the cost of unacceptable jumps in domestic

targets
prices.

A more recent strand of theorizing has added a new twist to the nominal

anchor approach. The literature spawned by the discovery of rational
expectations has stressed that the policy regime in place will shape the way
the private sector sets wages and prices in the economy. In a flexible-rate
regime, domestic price setters will take into account the policymakers'
incentive to alter the nominal exchange rate in order to achieve some "rear'

objective, an incentive that typically undercuts the price setters' desire to

maintain their relative prices. Moreover, any pronouncement that the
authorities' discretion over the exchange rate will not be "abused" is not
credible for standard time-inconsistency reasons, as long as the value of the
currency can be adjusted at more frequent intervals than wages and domes tic

prices. Consequently, the economy will settle at a high rate of inflation,
with no guarantee that the authorities will end up any closer to their real

targets. In this view, then, exchange-rate flexibility has a cost and no
benefits. It is better to give up discretion and subscribe to a fixed

-5-

exchange rate regime, thereby "anchoring" the domestic price level.2
Clearly, both approaches capture some of the reality in developing

countries, and neither can be judged right or wrong in the abstract. The
weight of arguments on the two sides will depend on the particulars of each

case. Here, we will lay out a simple, formal framework which captures the
essence of the arguments listed above and provides guidance as to how the

weighting of pros and cons can be done explicitly. We will then apply the
framework to the African member countries of the CFA Franc Zone. We will ask:
knowing what we do about their terms-of-trade history and their (as well as

their neighbors') performance over the lest three decades, did their decision
to join a currency union with France make sense?

II. The CFA Zone
The CFA Franc Zone consists of thirteen African countries which3 are

divided into two currency unions: the Union Monetaire Ouest Africaine and the

members of the Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale. Each union issues its
own currency. Since both currencies are the CFA Franc, the two unions are
referred to jointly as the "CFA Franc Zone."
The Zone is an extension of the monetary authority which governed these

former French colonies prior to independence. In the late l9SOs, the two
currency unions were set up, and the newly-independent Francophone countries

of Africa were given the option of joining. All but Guinea, Madagascar and

Mauritania did4 Membership in the Zone afforded these countries the
opportunity to pool their foreign exchange reserves. In addition, the Zone
was governed by certain rules which could be interpreted as a means of guiding

-6-

monetary policy in thes,a fledgling nation-states.5 First,

government

borrowing from the Central Bank could not exceed 20 percent of the previous

year's tax receipts. Second, the French government guaranteed the
convertibility of the CFA Franc. Member countries had to convert 65 percent
of their foreign exchange reserves into French Francs

and deposit them with

the French Treasury. Third, and most relevant to our study, the exchange rate
between the French and CFA Francs was fixed at 50 CFAF —

1

FF, the rate which

had prevailed since 1948. Changes in this parity required the unanimous
consent of all Zone members, including France. In other words, the rules of
the Zone made a nominal devaluation virtually

impossible.

While other aspects of the CFA Zone have changed over the last 30 years,

these three rules have remained intact. Several studies have asked whether
the rules have led to a difference in the economic
vis-a-vis some group of "comparator" countries.

performance of Zone members

Devarajan and de Melo (1987)

showed that CFA countries had a slightly higher growth rate of GDP than their
sub-Saharan African (hereafter "African") counterparts in the period 1960-82.

Guillaumont et al. (1988) obtained a similar conclusion by examining a richer

set of indicators. Both sets of authors attributed the differential
performance to the monetary and fiscal discipline engendered

by membership in

the CFA Zone.

However, in updating their study to include the 1980s, and looking at

a

broader set of indicators, Devarajan and de Melo (1990) arrived at more

equivocal results. While CFA countries continued to enjoy a slightly higher
GDP growth rate than their African neighbors, this difference was no longer

-7-

statistically significant for the l980s. Furthermore, along some other
dimensions, the CFA Zone's performance was noticeably worse. CFA countries
had lower export growth and investment levels in the l980s compared with other

African countries. When controlling for the size of the external shocks faced
by these groups of countries, Devarajan and de Melo found that CFA countries
achieved less current account reduction than their African neighbors.

Moreover, they experienced greater variability in growth than non-CFA

countries.6 On one dimension, however, the CFA countries continued to shine:
their average inflation rate was roughly half that of other African countries
in the 1970s, and one-seventh that of these countries in the l9BOs.
Furthermore, the degree of inflation-reduction between the l970s and l98Os,
controlling for external shocks, was significantly higher in the CFA Zone than
outside it.

In sum, both the rules of the CFA Zone and the performance of its members
make it an ideal case with which to study the pros and cons of fixed exchange

rates. The Zone has maintained a fixed parity with the French franc
throughout its history. The relative performance of Zone members vis-a-vis
their African counterparts illustrates the tradeoffs involved. On the one
hand, Zone members enjoyed lower inflation thanks to the fixed exchange rate

regime. On the other hand, they have apparently been unable to adjust their
economies to the large terms of trade shocks of the l98Os and have experienced

greater variability in output. One reason, no doubt, is their inability to

use nominal devaluatLons as an instrument of adjustment. Finally, the
comparison between CFA and other African countries is especially apt. For the

-8-

other African countries share most of the salient features with the CFA Zone

except the fixed exchange rate. They obtained independence at similar times
and are roughly at the same level of developments. All

are primary producers,

as are the CFA members. Since they produce similar goods, they faced the same
external shocks as the CFA countries during this period. In short, the other
African countries provide CFA members with a relatively accurate picture of

"life outside the Zone". The fact that these two groups of countries are
distinguished by exchange rate regime brings us as close to a controlled
experiment as economists could hope for.
III. The Framework

The experience of the CFA Zone illustrates the main tradeoff involved in
the choice of exchange rate regimes as indicated in section I: By committing
themselves to a fixed-rate regime, these countries could anchor their price
levels and maintain inflation close to the rate experienced by the country

whose currency serves as the peg. However, by doing so they lost the ability
to adjust to terms of trade shocks. Had they selected a flexible-rate

regime,

they would have been able to limit the damage done to the real economy by the

ups and down in the world prices of their main imports and exports. That, in
turn, would have come at the expense of a higher rate of inflation, as
domestic wage and price setters would have lacked the discipline, and domestic

monetary authorities the credibility, provided by an irrevocably fixed
exchange rate.7

Did these countries "do the right thing" by joining a currency union with

France? We will set up a simple model here to provide a partial answer to

-9-

this question.

Assume that the policymaker is interested in maximizing an objective
function in which both a nominal and a real variable play a role. The real

variable could be the current account1 output, or the growth rate. The

nominal variable could be the price level or inflation. Since presumably what
matters most to policymakers are growth and inflation, we will cast the model

in terms of these two variables. We express the objective function in
quadratic-loss form:

(1) W —

- ((it

-

*)2

+ (y -

where W denotes welfare, it is inflation, y is the growth rate,

is the weight

attached by the authorities to the real target relative to the nominal one,

and

and y* are the policy maker's targets for inflation and growth,

respectively.

(ic* can of course be zero,) A welfare maximum is attained when

inflation and growth hit their target levels (it —

and y —

y*)8

The

quadratic-loss formulation has well-known problems, chief among which is its

symmetric treatment of over- and under-shooting of targets. But for our
purposes, such problems are of secondary importance.
The equilibrium level of growth is determined by two variables, the
change in the real exchange rate and the terms of trade:

(2) y—5÷a(e - p)
where

+fl(r -

is the (exogenously given) "naturalTM rate of growth, e and p are (log

differences in) the exchange rate and the home-goods price, respectively, r is

-10-

the (log) terms of trade, and r is the mean level of the (log) terms of
trade. The parameters a and fi are positive. The terms of trade, T,

to be random, with variance 2 Note that (e-p) stands for the

is

taken

percentage

change in the real exchange rate. An equation like (2) follows from
expressing the level of output as a function of the level of the real

exchange

rate and the terms of trade.

To complete the model, we have to specify how domestic prices are

determined. We assume that domestic price (or wage) setters

are rational and

forward-looking, but that they can change their prices less frequently than

the authorities can adjust the exchange rate. Domestic prices

are therefore

set taking into account the government's exchange rate policy, but without

actually observing the exchange rate that will prevail. This provides policy
makers in principle temporary leeway in determining the real exchange rate by

altering the nominal exchange rate. Further, we assume that terms of trade
shocks are revealed after domestic prices are set. The. timing therefore is

as

follows:

1. p is set;

2. r is revealed;
3. e is set.

.1e assume that domestic price setters (e.g., urban workers) are rational

and forward-looking. In setting their prices, they are concerned both with
maintaining their relative prices and with adjusting to shocks. In reduced
form, their behavior can be summarized by expressing the change in domestic
prices as follows:

-Il-

(3)

p— E(e) +WE(T -

where E(x) stands for the expected value of x. The first term here
captures
the relative-price motive,9 while the second term captures the desired
adjustment in home prices in response to the expected terms-of-trade shock.
(u is a parameter representing the elasticity of the desired adjustment with

respect to the shock.) Note that p is set before r is revealed, and E(r -

— 0.

(4)

Therefore, (3) boils down to:

p — E(e).

Hence, home-goods prices (or, equivalently, wages) increase at the expected
rate of nominal depreciation.
Finally, inflation is a weighted average of the increases in the prices

of home goods and traded goods:1°

(5)

it

— pp

+ (l-p)e.

We are now ready to analyze the behavior of the economy under the two exchange
rate regimes.

(a) Fixed Exehanee Rates. The analysis of this case is very simple. Under
fixed exchange rates, the government irrevocably fixes the value of the

currency, giving up its discretionary power to alter it. As mentioned above,
rational expectations in this context imply p —

E(e).

Given the inflation

target of irk, then, the optimal policy for the government is to set e —

w.

-12-

This gives:

p — E(e) — e —

it*

That in turn implies that the equilibrium value of the real variable is

(6) y—y+(r -r).
Under this policy regime, then inflation stays on target while growth
fluctuates with the terms of trade,

(b) Flexible Exchan2e Rates. Under flexible rates, the government behaves in
a discretionary manner and determines the value of e to maximize its objective

function as expressed in Cl). When it does so, it takes home-goods prices (p)

as given (as they have been pre-set). Moreover, having observed the tens of
trade, it selects an exchange rate that is contingent on the realized value of

r. Substituting (2) and (5) into (1), we can write the objective function in
terms of e, p. and r:

W(e, p, r) — . [sp +(1-js)e -

*2

-

[(y*) + cx(e-p) fl(r-7)J2.
+

Maximizing this expression and solving for e yields:

(1) e —

+

(l-p)21

{(a2# -

p(l-p))p

+

(lp)r* + a#(y*)

-

Assuming that the policymaker places sufficient weight on the real target
(growth) so that [a2 -

Ci)

de/dr

< 0;

M(l-p)J > 0,

we get the following results:

-13-

(ii) 1 > de/dp > 0;
(iii) de/dw* >

0;

(iv) de/d(y*.) >

For ease of exposition1 assume an initial equilibrium where e —
p —

0.

The first of these inequalities states that the policynaker will react to
terms of trade shocks by compensatory exchange rate policy; a deterioration in

the terms of trade will be met by a depreciation. This is of course the main
advantage of flexibility in the exchange rate regime. The second result
states that an increase in home-goads prices will be accommodated by a

depreciation, but only partially. The reason for the partial accommodation is
the inflationary cost of depreciation. Third, a reduction in the target value
of inflation will call for an appreciation of the

currency.

The fourth result links exchange-rate policy to the relationship between

the government's target for growth and the natural level of growth. When the
government has an expansionary motive (y* > y), exchange-rate policy will

have a bias towards depreciation. For the rest of the analysis, we will
assume that this is indeed the case. There are two possible justifications

for this. First, for many reasons, we could think that the economy's natural
rate of growth is sub-optimal from a social standpoint. That could be due to
pre-existing rigidities in labor markets or various kinds of distortionary

(and unremovable) taxation. The government's desire to push the economy
beyond the rate at which the economy would settle on its own, then, would be a

well-meaning response to this sub-optimality. The second justification is

- 14-

based on a much less benign view. In this view, the bias towards

depreciation

derives from naughty motives: gaining political advantage by giving the
economy a temporary boost, or allowing inflationary finance of budget
deficits.

Under rational expectations, domestic price setters will take into

account the government's behavior, as captured by equation (7). Setting p —

E(e)

and taking the expectation of (7), we can derive the following expression

for the expected change in the exchange rate (and therefore the level of homegoods prices):

(8) E(e) — p —

+ (a/(liL)](y*

-

y)

where we have used the fact that E(r -

r)

— 0.

This is the rule followed by

the private sector in setting p. Note that home-goods inflation will be
higher, the greater the divergence between the target level of growth and its

natural level. That is because price setters will want to cover themselves
against currency depreciations that erode their relative prices. In turn, the
equilibrium level of depreciation of the exchange rate will be (by plugging
[8] into [7]):

(9) e —

+ [a/(lp)](y*

-

y)

-

(afl/[a2

÷

(l-p)2])(r

-

Note that (9) differs from (8) only by the last term, which is the terms of
trade shock that cannot be anticipated by price setters. Therefore, domestic
price behavior fully takes into account the systematic component of exchange
rate policy (the part due to the gap between y* and y), which implies that

-15-

the government's expansionary motive creates only inflation and no output
gains.

But discretionary policy does buy the economy something, and that is the
ability to alter the real exchange rate (and hence smooth output) in the face

of unanticipated terms of trade disturbances. This can be seen by solving for
the equilibrium level of y:

(10) y —

+ ((l-M)2/(a2#

+(l-p)2])$(r -

Since Ul-p)2/(a2 +(l-p)2fl <

I,

7).

exchange rate flexibility enables growth to

be less sensitive to fluctuations in the terms of trade than in the fixed
exchange rate case (as can be seen by comparing (10] with (6]).

(c) Welfare Comnarison of the Two Policy Rezimes. Table I summarizes the

inflation and growth consequences of the two policy regimes. The fixed
exchange-rate regime does better on the inflation front (on average), while
the flexible-rate regime does better on the real side of the economy by

reducing the fluctuations in growth rate. The next step is to derive an
explicit cost-benefit criterion for choosing between the two regimes.

The appropriate way to do so is to take an ex-ante stand and ask: which
of the two regimes provides a higher level of expected welfare, in light of
the structure of the economy, policy preferences of the authorities, and the

anticipated pattern of exogenous (in this case terms of trade) shocks? It is
possible to answer this question using the results obtained so far. For each
policy regime, we can plug the equilibrium outcomes for y and ir into the

objective function (1) and take the mathematical expectation.
Let
EWf

us

denote expected welfare under the fixed exchange-rate regime by

and the corresponding variable under the flexible exchange-rate regime by

-17-

EWnf• Then after some algebra and simplification, the difference between the
two can be expressed as:

(11) EWf -

(12) A —
We

EWf —

with

((y*5;)/(l,L)J2

fl2o2/(a2 +

will refer to (EWf - EWnf) as the net benefits of the fixed rate regime.

The composite parameter A is of ambiguous sijn, reflecting the tradeoff

between the costs and benefits of the two regimes. The first term

making up ts

captures the benefit of the fixed-rate regime, while the second term

represents the cost. A fixed rate is preferable to a flexible rate regime
whenever A is positive.

Note first that the variance of the terms of trade (2) enters on the

cost side. That is, the higher is 2, the less likely that a fixed rate
regime will be preferable to a flexible rate regime. Second, the higher is
(y* -

5;) the

more likely that a fixed exchange rate will be desirable. This

follows from the greater temptation of policy makers with expansionary

ambitions to inflate the economy (and depreciate the currency). A fixed
exchange rate rules out such depreciation, and leaves policy makers better

off, jg when judged by their own welfare criterion. Third, a high fi makes
flexible rates more desirable. That is, when the real economy is highly
susceptible to terms of trade shocks, flexible exchange rates have the edge.11

Next, we turn to the effect of .

It can be verified that:

d(EWf -

EWf)/d# > 0

whenever a

EWf)/d

whenever A C

0.

and

-18-

In words, when a fixed rate is preferable (A > 0), an increase in the weight
placed on the real target makes a fixed rate regime even more beneficial.
When a flexible-rate regime is preferable (A C 0), an increase in the weight

attached to the real target has ambiguous effects on the net benefits. With
respect to A itself, we can see from (12) that dA/d4 is unambiguously
positive: that is, there must exist a sufficiently high

such that a fixed

rate regime becomes preferable to a flexible rate one. This may Sound
paradoxical, because the benefit of a fixed-rate regime is lower inflation,

not higher growth. But it is an extension of the same logic: when policy
makers put a large weight on output relative to inflation, there will be
greater temptation to abuse the discretion allowed by flexible exchange rates

and a higher inflationary cost. Countries where economic policy is highly
politicized, where the central bank lacks autonomy, or where inflation has
become chronic and its perceived costs low are settings where we would expect

and

to be high.

In the preceding paragraph, we looked at the relationship between # and
the choice of policy regimes while holding constant all other parameters, and
(y*.5) in particular.

An alternative approach, and one that we will rely on

in our empirical analysis, is to ask how the choice of policy regimes is

affected by variations in ,

while

holding the inflation differential between

the two regimes constant. From Table 31. we can see that the averaee
inflation differential under the two regimes is given by:

(13) 'nf -

lrf

—

[a#/(l.pfl(y*i)

-19-

where the subscripts "nf" and "f" once again refer to the flexible and fixed

regimes respectively. This implies

2 *—2

(a#/(l-M)) (y -y) —

(irnf

-

Wf)

-

(a#fl)2c2/(a2 +

Substituting into (11) we get:

- Xf)2
(11) EWf - EWnf — (Itnf

(l,)2].

It can be shown that the second term on the right-hand side is increasing in

.

Thus, holding nf - wf) constant, EWf - EWnf is decreasing in .

Therefore,

controlling for the inflation differential, an increase in the

weight placed on the real target renders fixed rates jj advantageous. Note
that controlling for the inflation differential means in this context

adjusting (y*s) pan passu with

to maintain the difference between the

inflation rates fixed (see (13]).

We will use the formulation in (11') when we turn

to

the empirical

application to the CPA case. The reason is that we can get a rough handle on
the inflation differential under the two

countries

regimes by comparing CIA Zone

with other sub-Saharan countries with flexible exchange rates. By

contrast, (y*.5) is unobservable.

IV. The Tradeoffs: Empirical Application to the CIA Zone
As we mentioned earlier, there are at least two reasons why a model like
that described above is relevant and applicable to the case of the CIA Zone.
First, since CIA Zone countries are highly dependent on primary exports, terms

-20-

of trade shocks are the main exogenous force that buffets their economies.
Therefore our focus on the terms of trade would appear well placed.

Second,

the presence of neighboring countries with similar economic structures but
different exchange rate regimes allows us to construct a reasonable

counterfactual. In particular, we can derive some ballpark estimates of the
inflationary cost of exchange-rate flexibility by looking at the experience of
these comparator countries.

We proceed as follows. We first note that the choice of a fixed

exchange

rate regime implies a certain preference for price-stability over the real
target (or, in the language of the model in section III, a particular value of

in the objective function [1]). We then ask: Given the evolution of these
economies and of their external terms of trade, what does the fact that

they

joined the CFA Zone say about their revealed, ex ante valuation of the output-

inflation tradeoff? Finally, we compare the range of revealed outputinflation tradeoffs we obtain in this manner with what we consider to be
"reasonable" tradeoffs.

We proceed by determining the critical level of

at which the policy

maker would be indifferent between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

As discussed in the previous section, it is convenient to work with equation

(11'). Setting this equation equal to zero and solving for , we obtain the
critical value of ,.

#c.

This critical rate is a function of the inflation

differential under fixed and flexible rates nf -

rf),

as well as the other

parameters of the model. As implied by the earlier discussion, c is
increasing in the inflation differential and decreasing in

In words, as

-21-

the inflation cost of exchange-rate flexibility rises, the weight placed on
the real target must increase for the policy maker to remain at the same

margin of indifference. Conversely, as the terms of trade become more
variable, the weight placed on the real target must diminish for continued

indifference. Holding everything else constant, a #

higher than c would

imply that a flexible exchange rate regime would be preferable to a fixed rate

regime. We now proceed to calculate

We will need empirical estimates of

all the other parameters in equation (11').
To get a handle on (rnf -

Irf).

we exploit the structural similarity

between the CFA member countries and their neighbors. That is, we use the
difference between the average inflation rate inside the CFA Zone and in the

rest of sub-Saharan Africa as an estimate of (Wf -

'rf).

For the COP

deflator, this difference is IS percentage points (the CFA average rate

between 1973 and 1987 was 9 percent. the non-CFA average 24 percent). For the
consumer price index, the difference is close to 12 percentage points. We use
a figure which lies in between these two differences, with a slight bias
towards the GDP deflator: 13.8 percentage points.

As for the

term in equation (11'), this is obtained by taking the

(unweighted) average of the variances of the logarithms of the terms of trade

of all the CFA countries during 1965-87. The base data and the variances are
given in Table 2. We also present the levels of a2 for various sub-periods
and individual countries. With the former, we can ask whether the terms of
trade have become wore volatile so that the decision to fix the exchange rate

in 1965 no longer makes sense. With the latter, we calculate the revealed

-22-

tradeoffs for individual

countries

to see if

Zone membership

to be optimal for some countries but not others.

The parameters a, fi and p are difficult to estimate precisely. Hence, we

vary them parametrically in our calculations. The parameter a represents the
increase in growth for an additional one percent depreciation of the real

exchange rate. We vary this from a low of 0.05 to a high of 0.20 in our

sensitivity tests. Note that a — 0.20 implies that a ten percent real
depreciation will spur growth--temporarily--by two percentage points. The
parameter fi is the impact of a terms of trade shock on real income. As a
first approximation, the direct effect of the shock will be to reduce real

income by the share of imports in GDP. Note that this share is also linked to
(l-p), the share of tradables in the price index. Under some conditions, the

two are equal (see Devarajan, Lewis and Robinson [1991]). Therefore, we set
i-p —

fi

in our calculations and vary fi from 0.10 to 0.40.

One last step is needed before we can interpret our calculations. It
will be convenient to state our results in terms of implied output-Inflation
tradeoffs, rather than

itself. The tradeoff can be recovered from 0c by

calculating the marginal rate of substitution between w and y along an
indifference curve (i.e., holding dW —

0).

Differentiating the objective

function (I):

(14)

This

dr/dyI_0 —
gives us the revealed inflation-output tradeoff along the locus on which

the country would have been indifferent between a fixed and flexible exchange

-23-

rate regime. Remember that

is the maximum # for which fixed rates still

make sense (holding the inflation differential and other parameters constant).
Therefore the expression dw/dyldw_o answers the following question: what is
the maximum increase in inflation that the government is revealed to be
willing to trade off against a single percentage point increase in growth,
given that it has chosen to join the CFA Zone?
In order to map the values of

to this inflation-output tradeoff, we

need to know y, y, r and

in (14). It is reasonable to take as the target

level of inflation, w — 0.

For the actual level, we take iv

— 0.08, which is

about the average for CFA countries throughout the post-independence period.

The target GDP growth rate (y*) is taken to be 0.0$, which is at the lower end

of the range of targets in the (usually optimistic) Five-Year Plans of thse
countries. The actual (y) will be 0.03, which is about the average
performance of CFA countries in this period.
Incorporating these assumptions, table 3 presents the revealed inflationoutput tradeoffs for the countries which chose to join the fixed exchange rate
regime. Note that for most values of a and fi, the implied tradeoff between

growth and inflation is exceedingly steep. For example, when a —

0.1$

and p —

0.25, dr/dyp,_0 is 1.51. The interpretation is that for the decision to join
the CFA Zone to have made sense (given these particular values of a and fi),

member countries should have been willing to tolerate no more than a one and a

half percentage point increase in inflation for a one percent increase in

their average annual GD? growth rate. In other words, the implied preference
for price stability over output is extremely high. If they were willing to

-24-

tolerate a higher inflation rate for this boost in their growth rate, they
should not have opted for a fixed exchange rate regime.
The revealed tradeoff is even steeper for a country like Cabon. which
suffered the largest terms of trade shocks in the CPA Zone (see Table 2).

This is intuitive. The costs of a fixed exchange rate regime rise with the
variance of the terms of trade. For Cabon to have joined the CFA Zone,
therefore1 it must have had an exceptionally low tolerance for inflation vis-

a-via growth (see second panel of Table 3). Likewise, Senegal's tradeoff is
the least steep, because it enjoyed the lowest variance in its terms of trade
(bottom panel of Table 3).

Sensitivity analysis with the inflation differential (not reported here)

does not significantly alter the results. For example, raising the inflation
differential to its "high" estimate, 15 percentage points, raises Senegal's
tradeoff for the intermediate values of a and ft

(0.15 and 0.25, respectively)

to 6.4 percentage points. That is, even if the gains from joining the Zone
were 15 percentage points lower average inflation, the Senegalese revealed
that they were only willing to tradeoff 6.4 percentage points of inflation for
one percentage point increase in their CD? growth rate.
Our impression is that most African policymakers would be willing to
trade up to about 10 percentage points of inflation for a one percentage point
increase in their CD? growth rate--that is, to increase their growth from 3 to

4 percent per annum on average. Given that most of the numbers in Table 3 lie
below this figure, it appears that the decision to join the CPA Zone reflects

an excessive anti-inflation bias. Put another way, if the future is going to

-25-

be anything like the past, CFA countries should perhaps seriously evaluate
whether they wish to remain in a fixed exchange rate regime.
V. Concludinp Remarks

We should stress that we have concentrated here on only some aspects of

the costs and benefits of the CFA Zone. We have ignored some important
benefits, including the savings obtained by pooling reserves and the
attractiveness to foreign investors of a convertible currency. In addition, we
have left unmentioned the special relationship with France (and the French

treasury) implied by the existence of the Zone. Depending on one's
perspective, the latter consideration can be viewed as either a net gain or
loss.

Our focus instead has been on the costs of maintaining a fixed exchange

rate regime in the context of highly variable external terms of trade. We
have attempted to measure the welfare costs arising from the inability to
adjust the exchange rate, and to pit these costs against the benefits of lower

inflation. The inflation differential between CFA and non-CFA African
countries has been around 14 percentage points. We attribute this
differential to the standard time-consistency problem inherent in

discretionary macroeconomic policy. Nonetheless, our highly stylized
calculations suggest that fixed exchange rates have been, on the whole, a bad

bargain for the CFA member countries. For most of the CFA members, the
inflation benefits do not appear to have been large enough to offset the costs

on the output side. Under "reasonable" output-inflation tradeoffs, these
countries would have been better off having the flexibility to adjust to

-26-

external shocks.

This

conclusion needs one important caveat. Our counterfactual

effectively assumes that CFA policy makers would have followed the appropriate
exchange rate policies in response to terms of trade shocks, had they had the

freedom to do so. In light of experience with exchange rate policy in the
rest of Africa, this is perhaps a doubtful supposition. Possibly, exchangerate flexibility would have brought only inflation, and no output benefits.

2. This is of course closely related to the literature on "rules versus
discretion". See Fischer (1990) for a general survey.
3. The countries are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Cabon, Mali, Niger,

Senegal and Togo. Mali left the Zone in 1965 and rejoined in 1984.
Equatorial Guinea became a member in 1985.

4. Togo did not join at the outset, but did so after a change of govertwtent
in 1963.

5. For wore detailed descriptions of the institutional arrangements in the
CFA Zone, see Ehatia (1985) and Guillaumont and Cuillaumont (1984).
6.

The unweighted average of the standard deviation of growth for the CFA

countries is 7.2 percentage points over the entire 1973-87 period. The
comparable average for other African countries is 5.4 percentage points.

7. Our approach is somewhat related to that taken in the literature

on the

insulating properties of fixed and flexible exchange rates in the presence of
domestic and external shocks of different kinds (see for example Boyer, 1978,

and Aizenman and Frenkel, 1985). However, this literature focused on the

goal

of stabilizing output only, and neglected the price discipline argument for
fixed rates.

8. With a slight reinterpretation of variables, the model can also be stated
in tens of the levels of output and prices, rather than their growth rates.

-28-

We chose the latter because thay are the more relevant variables for policy.

9. There is actually a slight conceptual problem here. Since p and e stand
for the changes in the exchange rate and home prices, the relative-price

motive is stated in proportional, rather than absolute, form. This implies
that price setters let bygones be bygones, and do not attempt to make up for

previous losses (or gains). Tracking these dynamic effects would complicate
the model considerably.

10. Note that inflation has no direct effect on the equilibrium growth rate
(2). Of course, in the long run, persistent inflation will undermine economic
activity and growth, which is one of the reasons why inflation is included
separately in the objective function (1).

11.

fi

is

likely to be large in economies that are very open. Openness

therefore increases the desirability of flexibility in exchange rates. This
is at odds with the usual conclusion drawn in the literature on optimum

currency areas, wherein greater openness is taken to imply less latitude in
manipulating the real exchange rate through changes in the nominal rate,
making flexibility less desirable.
