Introduction

I.

It is by now widely recognized that investment decisions play
a major role in the determination of individual age—earnings pro-

files. Several studies, most notably Mincer [1974], rely on
investment in human capital as a leading single hypothesis from

which many of the observed regularities in earnings data are
derived.

The investment hypothesis, in its simplest form, can be

summarized by the equation:V
Y = F(K,K)

(1)

where Y is observed earnings, K is potential earnings ("human
capitalt'), and IC is its rate of change. Competitive equilibrium

in the labor market places restrictions on the signs of the partial

derivatives. Specifically, so long as human capital contributes
to earnings (i.e.,

> 0), the individual must give up current

earnings in order to enhance future earning opportunities (i.e.,

< 0). It is typically assumed that, at each point in his life,
the individual faces a spectrum of earnings-investment combinations

("jobs"),

capital is embodied in the individual and cannot be sold leads

to several important differences. First, since the property
rights to human capital cannot be transferred, the finiteness

of life plays a central role in human investment. By contrast,

even a firm

which

in its assets after a fixed

number of years will behave "as if" its horizon were infinite

so long as its assets are marketable. Seconds since either the
utilization or formation of human capital requires the sacrifice
of leisure (a specific consumption good), it is not possible in
general to separate the consumption and investment problems as

is done in the theory of the firm.—
•

importantly, neither human capital nor the investment therein
are normally observable. Th-is investment functions, such as
those of Jorgenson [1963] and others, are not applicable to

human capital theory. If the model fails to generate testable
predictions about o!servable variables like wage rates and
earnings, then it is not a very fruitful one.

All of these features make the human investment problem

much more difficult theoretically than the firm's problem. Lack
of data on human capital leads to still another difficulty: it
is hard to distinguish empirically among the effects of investment

and a myriad of other influences on actual earnings. The most
obvious of these, of course, is the chcice of work intensity,

which affects both current earnings (labor-leisure choices) and
the rate of human capital accumulation (training-leisure choices).
The purpose of this paper is to present a simple. life-cycle

model of investment in human capital in which leisure choices

are explicitly incorporatel. In so doing, we integrate two pre-

viously disparate branches of life-cycle theory: models of
labor supply with exogenous ziges," and models of human capital

formation with exogenous ieisureA" Of course, to accomplish
this, we must posit utility maximization as the individual's
goal rather than income maximization.

Apart from the direct interest in the interaction of labor
supply and human investment over the life cycle, suèh a model
is needed to test the robustness of the widely-used wealth-

maximization models of human capital accumulation. For example,
a standard implication of these models is that a period of
specialization in investment (interpreted as schooling), if it

for example, Weiss [1972), Blinder [1974, Ch. 3], Heckman
[1974]. The paper by Weiss allows for endogeneity of wages due
to learning by doing, but not for human iPvestment.

1See, for example, Ben-Porath [1967], tqeiszacker [1967),
Sheshinski [1968]. Formally, our approach also embraces lifecycle consumption theory, but we take pains to separate this
from the other two problems, and have little to say about
consumption.

-4-

exists, will occur only at the beginning of life.' However,
one can imagine that when schooling involves foregone leisure
the existence of pure time preference might lead a utility-

maximizing individual to postpone his education. Such possi-

bilities appear explicitly in our model. Another important
implication of, the wealth-maximization model is that the fraction

of time spent investing falls throughout the post-schooling in-

vestment period. This turns out to be generally true in our model
as well, though some exceptionc are noted.

To our knowledge, there have been four previous attempts
(all unpublished at this writing) to integrate human capital and

labor supply as we do here. The treatment by Becker and Chez
[1972] is the most general and explores the widest variety of

issues. But it is also the least ambitious in that they generally
content themselves with stating and interpreting the first-order

conditions. Our model can be viewed as a special case of theirs,

but a case which is pushed much farther. The three other studies1
at least attempt to analyze the shape of the optimal plan, and

naturally adopt simplifying assumptions in order to do so. Typically, the rate of investment in human capital and the supply of
labor are related to some key variable such as the stock of human

capital or its shadow price (both unobserved). However, since the

this, see Weiss [1971], Ishikawa [1973], and also the references
cited in the preceding footnote.

models generally do not fully determine the behavior of these
endogenous variables, a disturbing and unnecessary amount of

ambiguity remains. Further, except for Beckman [1975], virtually
no attention is paid to periods of specialization such as schooling

or retirement. This seems a major omission.
The model presented here is more general than previous work

on the subject (with the exception of Becker and Chez), and yet

generates many more concrete conclusions. Among the restrictions
which our model places on opttnal plans are:

(a) Several distinct patterns in investment, work and
leisure may arise, depending on the subjective
rate of impatience (i.e., the discount rate for
future utilities).

(b) We consider the case where the rate of impatience
is

"small" (in a sense to be defined later) to

be the leading case. We show that in this case
specialization in schooling can only occur at
the beginning of life, while retirement can only
come at the end.

(c) Schooling is followed by a period of on-thejob training, during which the fraction of

potential earnings and time devoted to human
capital formation declines monotonically.

-6—

Cd) Investment reaches zero some finite time before
retirement

(or death, if there is no retirement).

Thus there is a finite interval of "pure work"
with no investment late in life. This econometric finding of Ilincer [1974] is explicitly

ruled out by the Ben-Porath [1967] formulation
of the problem (which is followed by Reckman
[1975] arid by Stafford and Stephan [1973].

(e) The demand for leisure over the life cycle is

"U-shaped", with a tendency to decline during
schooling and the early part of 031, and
thereafter to rise.
(f)

Wages rise to a single peak, which occurs
after

the peak in hours of cyork.

Of course, we do not pull these rabbits out of the proverbial
hat.

Like

assumptions

other investigators, we have to make some

simplifying

of which two seem most crucial. First, (I) is given

the special form:
1 =

(2)

F(K,K) = lCgflC/K),

g' 'C

Q.

The nature of this important function is the subject of the next

section. Here we only wish to point out that the formulation is
quite similar to that of Rosen [1973] who dealt with the special
case F(K,TC)

=

K — C(LC),

C'

(IC)>O. In

both specifications, K is

defined as earning capacity, i.e., the amount the individual would

—7—

earn in the absence of investment. While Rosen orders jobs by
their absolute rate of increase of earning potential (K), and
deducts costs additively, we order jobs by their proportionate
rate of growth in potential earnings (K/K), and deduct costs

multiplicatively. In principle, either representation is as
good as the other, but the multiplicative version leads more
naturally to the logarithmic wage functions encountered so frequently in empirical work (Weiss [1974]).

Our second important assumption is that, for a given input
of time, the quantity of humau cnpital created is proportional

to the stock of human capital. In the terminology popularized
by Ben—Porath [19673, the "human capital production function"

is homogeneous of degree one in K. This specification which is
suggested by Mincer's work [1974], simplifies the mathematics

considerably. Thus it is both "realistic" and convenient, a

combination encountered all too rarely in mathematical economics.

147e do not wish to oversell this assumption. Hackman's [1975]
empirical work certainly does not support it.

-8-

2.

The Earnings-Invetmen Frontier
Basic to any model of human capital is the market constraint

delimiting the combinations of current earnings and human capital
formation which are obtainable from a given stock of human capital.

This function, which we call the "earnings-investment frontier",

is defined implicitly by (1). It is clearly downward sloping.
Several frontiers, corresponding to different levels of K, are

depicted in Figure 1. (If there is depreciation, K can be negative.)
Our special form (2) enables us to divide both axes of Figure 1 by
K, so that a single frontier, applicable to

K, can be drawn.

Thus it plays for us the role that constant returns to scale plays

in growth theory. The frontier is sketched in Figure 2, where the

new symbol, x, has replaced + &.

As indicated in the introduction,

we index jobs by their proportionate rate of growth. x is this in-

dex, and it runs from zero to unity. x

I indicates the job which

yields the maximum feasible rate of growth. It makes sense to call
this "going to school", and to specify that g(l) = 0, i.e., that

allearnings are sacrificed during schooling. Conversely, x = 0
is the job where potential earnings are fully realized, so g(O)

I.

The locus is a "frontiet4' in the usual sense: points (like

p) in the interior are feasible, but never would be optimal; points
(like q) beyond the frontier would be preferred by the worker, but
are not attainable.

cJe know, of course, that g'(x)cO, but can we

say anything about its convexity? The answer is that' we can rule
out convexity (to the origin), but either linear or concave frontiers

seem possible. The argument is simple. If g(x) were in fact convex, as in Figure 3, and arbitrage was permitted, no worker would

accept a job with 0 C x < 1. This is because he could always
spend a fraction A of his work day at x
school (x =

1),

0 and a fraction 1-A in

thereby creating for himself an opportunity set

portrayed by the straight line g(x).= l-x (shown in Figure 3 as

a dotted line).!' Since this line dominates his market opportunities he would never deal with the market. Employers offering
jobs with 0 C x C 1 would have to raise wages until evelEy job was

at least as attractive as arbitraga.

Can a similar argument be used to rule out concive g(x) func-

tions? We think not. Workers clearly prefer jobs above the
g(x) =

l-x

line to arbitrage. Thus, to ruLe then out,

one

would

have to show that firms offering such jobs would suffer losses in

a competitive market. As this involves analysis of the production

of the firms for both goods and human capital, such an

would rest on specific assumptions

about these functions.

full analysis of the behavior of firmc in the human capital

market is beyond the scope of this essay. We refer the interested
reader to Rosen [1972], who argues that,due to diminishing returns,
the provision of training by firms requires increasing marginal
sacrifice Qf other outputs so that g(x) must be concave.

2JThe argument clearly assumes no frictions in moving between the
job and the school.

—10-

While we consider both cases to be open possibilities, the bulk

of our analysis assumes g"(x) < 0. As we indicate Later, a model
almost identical to the present one can be constructed using a
linear frontier, g(x)

l-x. There is only one important difference.

A concave frontier means that combining work with education on the

job is stric4y

better

than blending attendance at school with a no-

training job, while the linear frontier means they are equally
good. If there is some positive interaction between earning arid
learning, the worker can capture some "pure profit" by on-the-job

training. Therefore, the "full wage" (including the value of
training), which is equated to the marginal rate of substitution
(NRS) between consumption and leisure for optiinality, exceeds his

potential wage by the amount of pure proCit. Only if g(x) =

l-x

will there be no pure profits, so thrt the MRS is equated to the
potential wage, a conclusion which Becker and Chez reach in their
model (and claim to be very important).

The differences between g"(x) < 0 andg"(x) = 0 are at least
partly observable, in the latter case, workers should be found
"buying" training in schools just about as frequently as on the

job. In the former case1 training should be bought in schools
only during the period of specialization; part-time education should
take place predominantly on the job.

Statement of the Problem
The individual is assumed to derive utility from three sources:

the stream of lifetime real consumption, c(t); the time profile of

leisure, (t); and the bequest, or terminal value of real (nonhuman)
assets,

Here t denotes the individual's age, and runs from

zero to T, the length of life which is assumed known and exogenous.

Specifically, lifetime utility is assumed to be additively separable

with a constant rate of time discounting
(3)

fU(c,z)etdc ,

where U(c,z) and B(A(T)) are asucaed to be twice-differentiable
strictly concave functions of their arguments, and p is what we call

the rate of impatience.V En order to nile out optimal paths with
segments of zero consumption or zero leisure, we further assume:
Urn U (c,L)
c

Urn 1J2(c,&) =

all c.

£40
Finally, to allow retirement as an endogerious decision, we exclude
from our analysis functions which preclude loot leisure. Letting
Z(t) denote the fraction of available time devoted to leisure, thIs
amounts to assuming that U1(c,L) > 0 for any c.

will be assumed that a person's human wealth dies with him,
i.e. cannot be bequeathed.

variable rate of impatience could be accomodated without too
much difficulty. But it would make the notation more cumbersome,
and qualitative results would depend on the time profile of p(t).

—12—

What are the constraints on this maximization problem? To
begin with, there are two constraints on

the

time budget. Letting

h(t) denote the fraction of time devoted to market activity (including work and education), we have:

h(t) + &(t) = 1

(4)

h(t)>O

(5)

As noted above, the occupational index is bounded between zero
and unity:

Occ(t) <1

(6)

And, finally, the differential equations governing the change in
the stocks of human and nonhuman capital are respecti":ely:

K =

A =

(x,h,K)

rA + Y(x,h,K)-c

where r is the real rate of interest,i" the function (.)

is

the

production function for human capital, and Y() gives earnings as
a function of the job, the number of hours worked, and the level

of human capital. This is actually considerably more general than
the problem we solve. We begin this way in order to show explicitly
how our simplifying assumptions reduce the problem to manageable

proportions. There are two initial conditions, correspondinq to

Letting r denote the real rate of interest implicitly incorporates
changes in the price of consumer goods. To see this, note that if
P were the price of goods and I were the nominal rate of interest,
the change in nominal financial assets would be given by:

and both terminal stocks are to be chosen optimally.

To set up this problem in a form suitable for the application
of Pontryagin's maximum principle, we substitute (4) into (3),

define shadow princes p()t for human capital and l.l(t)et for
financial wealth, and write the Hamiltonian function:

so the marginal utility of consumption grows or declines at a steady

exponential rate. The consumption-bequest plan has been analyzed
extensively elsewhere, and we shall pay little attention to it

hereafter.—

Consider next the first—order conditions for optimal x and h,
assuming that an interior solution obtains for each (we shall worry

about corners presently). They cre:

U&(c,&) =

We now introduce the following assumption, mentioned in the introduction;
Al: The functions (x,h,K) and Y(x,h,TC) are
both homogenous of degree one in IC.
Specifically,

(x,h)K
reduces (ll') and (12") to;
x,h,K) =

and Y(x,h,K) = y(x,h)K.

(11')

U(c,) = PK'(Xh).+t2Ky(x,h)

(12')

PK(x,h) +pxy (x,1i) = 0.

So Al transforms a problem with three state variables (p, p and K)

to one with only two state variables: pK, which is the shadow value
(in utils) of the stock of human capital; and K, which is the potential wage rate converted into utils.

i"See Atkinson [1971] or Blinder [1974, Ch. 2]. For a treatment
which ignores bequests, see Ynari [1964] or Weiss [1972].

—15—

The next simplification comes from defining the occupational

index, x, in the way suggested in Section 2. Namely, x indexes
jobs in terms of equivalent schooling time, so that working h hours

at job x is equivalent (in the production of human capital) to

spending xh hours in school. Note that this is not a restrictive
assumption, but a convenient measurement convention which enables
us to write:
cp(x,h) =

(13)

4'(xh).

While the analysis could be carried out more generally, it
will keep things clear if we assume:

1.2: The hourly wage rate does not depend on
hours of work. In symbols: y(x,h)K =

g(x)hK.
This prevents the issues we wish to focus on ——

especially

the

interplay between human investment and work effort -- from becoming

clouded with other issues such as overtime pay or penalties for
part-time work.Using equation (13) and A2, (11') and (12') reduce
to:
(11)

IJ(cz) = f'(xh)pICx + lJKg(x)

(12)

h[f'(xh)pK +

pKg'(x)] =

0

Most of our broad results, including the general characterization of the life cycle plan, can be obtained from these two equations

(and the corresponding inequalities for corner solutions). However,
to get certain more severe (and empirically testable) restrictions

on the optimal path, we need to make one of the following linearity

—16—

assumptions:
A3: The function f(xh) is linear, i.e. £'(xh) =
a, for all x, h.
or

A3': The function g(x) is linear, i.e. g'(x) =
—1

for all x.

The meaning of A3' is discussed in Section 2. What is the economic
interpretation of A3? Mincer [1974) has argued, both theoretically
and empirically, that the functional relation between potential
earnings and accumulated years of schooling (denoted by the symbol
S) takes the following specific form:

Kye aSa—6t
where iS

is

the rate of depreciation of earning capacity (possibly

zero). Differentiating this logarithmically yields:

K

aS—..

But, by the way we defined x, it is definitionally true that

S=

so we have:
(7)

'=axh—6.

As the reader will recognize, this is just our general human capital

production function (7'), modified as per Al, A3, and (13). To
wit, A3 is essentially equivalent to assuming that

the

Minder wage

function holds.

.YThe reader familiar with Weiszacker [1967] or Sheshinski [1968)
will recognize this as an extension of their formulation to allow
for variable labor supply.

—17—

We present here the results of the thodel using A3, rather than

A3'. However, we have also worked out the model with A3',1" and
can report that the two models give identical results, with only

one exception. The exception was noted in our discussion of the

earnings-investment frontier: when the frontier is linear, there
is no distinction between the potential wage and the "full wage"

(to be defined below). Since neither is observable, this difference is probably subtle enough to be ignored. Mathematically,
nonlinearity in g(x) turns out to be almost a perfect substitute
for nonlinearity in f(xh), and equation (12) shows why this is so.

Clearly, either f" < 0, or g" C 0, but not both, is requtred for

a regular interior maximum for x. Making both functions concave
is

a kind of "overkill" which complicates the mathematics con-

siderably (and, we would argue, needlessly). While we

conjecture

that all of our results go through to this more general case, we
have bean unable to prove it.

To summarize, then, our model is the Daximization of (3),
subject to the constraints (4)—(6), and the differential equations (7) and:

Interpretation of the Optimality Conditions
In the next section, we develop a phase diagram to assist us

in understanding when the individual elects one of the, three pos-

sible corner solutions (x = 0, x = 1, or h =

0) rather than the

interior solution. To facilitate this, we will need one further
assumption:

A4: Instantaneous utility is separable in
consumption and leisure, Le., U(c,L) =
u(c) + v(&).

However, before doing this, greater understanding of the problem
can be achieved by recasting and interpreting the first-order
conditions.

Recall that p(t) and 1j(t) are, respectively, the shadow prices

(in current utils) of human and nonhuman rapital,' so the ratio,
p(t)Ip(t) =

e(t),

denotes the money price of human capital. Thus

we can define V(t) = e(t)K(t) as the money value of the human
capital stock, and trace of behavior of V(t) over time. To do
this, use condition (ii) to write:
(p4-cS) -

(16)

mcii -

g(x)hK

-

Then by (7) and (10):
(17)

V =

rV — hg(x)K.

Finally, since human capital cannot be cashed in at the and of life

(K(T) >0), the transversality condition (iv)iraplies that"(T) = 0.

VConsumption goods are the numeraire, hence thRre is no distinction
between a dollar of money and a unit of consumer goods.

—19—

This terminal condition allows us to solve differential equation
(17) explicitly viz:
(18)

V(t) =

f

e_r(T_t)h(t)g(x(.r))K(r)dt.

That is, V(r) is the present vzilue, in time t dollars, of future

earnings -—

avery

natural interpretation of the value of the

human capital stock. Equation (17) expresses the fact that

the

optimal paths of the shadow prices, p(t) and p(t), will render the
individual incapable of making his human wealth grow faster than
the rate of interest, and he can achieve this limiting growth rate

only by staying in school (x =

1).

Looking at human wealth in

terms of time t = 0 dollars, (17) says that human

wealth

stays

constant during schooling, and thereafter declines pE.ri passu

with earnings. Earnings, hg(x)K, are like withdrawals from a
"human
rate

bank account" where interest is

compounded continuously at

r.
Using the variable V(t), we can rewrite the optimality cortdi-

tion

(15) in a form which is readily interpretable:

-g'(x)K =
(15.')

if 0<x<1

-g'(O)K > aV

Here —g' (x)K is the marginal cost in terms of foregone earnings per
hour of raising x, and it can be shown that aV measures the marginal

benefits in higher future earnings.—1/

Thus during the schooling period (x =

the internal rate of return

on human investment is strictly greater than the interest rate,

despite the fact that hours-of—study are variable..U During the
post-school investment period, the marginal rate of return is always

equal to the rate of interest. It is worth noting that these re—
suits hold for 2X arbitrary leisure profile, and are thts independent of tastes. Therefore, one can verify ex. post whether individuals

have behaved optimally by computing the apropriate rates of return.
Of course, when labor supply is a choice variable, the rate of return is ill—defined as an ex ante concept.

Let us know turn to the condition for optimal work effort,

(14). When theta is no investment (x =

0),

wages are exogenous to

the individual,' and, in view of (9), (14) simply states that the
marginal rate of substitution is equal to the (potential and actual)

wage. Analysis of the age-hours profile is exactly as in our previous

models of dynamic labor supply with exogenous wages.' Becker and
Ghez [1972] have claimed that this marginal condition also holds
when wages are endogenous, and that therefore for the analysis of
time-versus-goods substitution in consumption we need not worry

about why wages change. Two

remarks

can be made about this finding.

First, when there is investment, the observed wage and the potential

wage are very different. Nor is their behavior over tine identical;
we show later that during OJT the ratio of observed wage/potential

wage is monotonically rising. Second, as indicated earlier, the

MRS

equated to the poéentiaj. wage only in the special case of

a linear earnings—investment frontier. To see, divide trie left—

The Temporal Succession of Life—Cycle Phases
Due to the possibility of corner solutions, four qualitatively

distinct phases might occur in an individual's life cycle. Whether
each phase occurs, how long each phase lasts, and the temporal

order of the phases form the subject of this section. We give the
four phases descriptive names, and numbers which seem to indicate
a sensible ordering, as follows:!"
Phase I,

Schooling: x = 1, h > 0

Phase II,

0.fl: 0<x<l, h>O

Phase III, Work: x0, h>O
Phase IV, Retirement: h = 0
Note that when h = 0 the value of x is arbitrary as is clear from

(15). Economically, this says that a retied person can be considered
as holding any job at all (and working zero hours).

To facilitate the exposition, we define two new state variables:

and

are characterized by the following equations:

It is clear from (21.1) and (21.3) that the precise shape of g(x)

strongly colors the likelihood and length of each phase. For
example, suppose ..gt(l)

w,

as in Figure tea. Then (21.1) makes

it clear that the individual will never specialize in schooling.
The reason is that there are jobs (x's very near unity) which are
nearly as effective as schooling in imparting skills, but which
pay a positive wage. So finiteness of -g' (1) is a minimal re-

quirement for schoolingto be possibla. We assume this is true.
As another extreme, suppose g' (0) =

0, as in Figure 4b. Then

(21.3) shows that Phase III (work without training) is impossible.
This is because there would be a job with a wage arbitrarily close
to the no—training job, but which gave a finite amount of training.
To portray our model in (A,*) space we must locate the bound-

aries of each region. Assume first that h > 0, so we need only
worry about the pre-retirement phases. Since g(x) is continuous
from the left at x = 1, (21.1) defines the boundary of the
schooling region as the ray, A =

—g'(1),

in Figure 5. Similarly,

since g(x) is continuous from the right at x = 0, (21.3) definec

This last boundary defines a convex'1 set such that for any pair

(x,,

) in

the interior, the individual will allocate all of his

time to leisure.

In this space, the optimal trajectory can, in principle,

begin anywhere. But, since the trausversality condition is p(T) = 0,

it must terminate on the horizontal axis. This trivial obgervation
already establishes that anyone who ever works will indeed have
a Phase III, i.e. a finite period of work without OJT. In other
words, so long as we do not rule Phase III out of court by

ThIs says G(A,*) is a convex function, and the
is our desired boundary. Note that when the

maximum is found at x = 1, G(A,ip) = A; and when x = 0 is the maximum,
C(X,p) = Ci. Thus above the —g'(l) ray, the boundary is A=; and below
the —g'(O) ray, the boundary is JF.

—25—

assuming -g'(O) = 0, Phase III must be last phase before retirement

(or death) in any optfral plan. We believe this makes sense, and
is an argument against using the Ben-Porath [1967] specification.

One other interesting observation can be made already. If

the potential wage, is less than

,

the marginal utility of

complete leisure, then the work activity is unattractive. Similarly,

if A < , the schooling activity is unattractive. However, Figure
5 shows that there is a region where both

of

these inequalities

hold, and yet the individual chooses not to retire. This means
that, for some values of g, and

,

the

option of combining work

and schooling by On keeps the individual on the job when he would

othendse retire. It can be shown that this is a direct implication of the concavity of the earning-investment frontier.1"
To determine the nature of optimal trajectories in Figure 5,

it is necessary to know how A and 4i change over tine. Using the
definitions of A and p, and equations (7), (10), and (16), it
follows that:
(22)

A = pA — a4,g(x)h

Specifically, the 'P

Behavior of the trajectory in Phase II is governed by the

We have drawn both loci with positive slopes. In fact, while they
bath must start this way (at points A and B), either slope or both

might turn negative. This is not important. What is important,
and what can be proven (see appendix) is that they always have a
unique intersection which is in Phase II, and that the A = 0 locus
cuts the ip

It is clear from Figures 6 and 7 that the temporal succession

of life—cycle phases will be quite different in the two cases. We
believe the Y > 0 case is more "realistic", and hence will concen-

trate an it. Our reason is that people with r a p (and, a fortiori,
I > 0 as long as 6 > 0) have an optimal consumption path which is
everywhere nondecreasing, while persons with p > r have a declining

optimal consumption path.!' Unfortunately, this cage is the more

case, see Weiss [1972]. Our point is that this specific model behaves

difficult. The reason is a phenomemon we call "cycling", that is,
the recurrence of a specific phase more than once in an optimal

life cycle. For example, inspection of Figure 6 raises the possibility that it might be optimal to attend school, then take

OJT, and then return to school again. The reader will doubtless
note many other possibilities for cycling when y > 0, but there
is little room for cycling when y S

0.

Let us, therefore, deal first with people with "high impatience", i.e. p > r +

&." Tha

following propositions, which

rather sharply delimit the kinds of life cycles that could ever
be optimal for such a person, follow by inspection of Figure 7.
(a) The only possibility of cycling is that an optimal
path might include two disjoint periods of work,
separated by a period of Ofl.
(b) If there is a period of schooling, it comes either
at the beginning of life or immediately after retirement. A period of On follows schooling.
(c) If there is a period of retirement, it comes at
the beginning of life.!'
(d) If there is a period of Oft (and there will be
one unless the optimal path irzñudes no training
whatever), it is followed by a period of work.
(e) The last years of life are a period of work.
Thus

the "normal" life cycle for persons with high impatience

(depicted by the dotted path in Figure 7), assuming most people find
it optimal to take some schooling and some retirement, is roughly as

thatif the rate of growth of wages in the absence of investment, —6, is positive (due to economy-wide prothictivity changes) and
exceeds the real rate of interest, then all persons are in this class.

follows: an initial period of retirement is followed by schooling,
then by O.JT, and then by pure work until death.

Of course, life-cycles with early retirement are rarely ob-

served in practice. But this is not because such programs are
irrational. Individuals with very high impatience (or very

high

positive exogenous wage growth) will want to bunch their leisure

early in life. To do do, since consumption depends on lifetime
discounted earnings, they will have to work very hard when they

are old. We may surmise that it is the absence of perfect capital
markets that precludes all but inheritors of large fortunes from
pursuing such a program.

Labor Supply and Human Investment in a Normal Life Cycle
It can be seen from Figure 6 that, if the life plan includes
schooling and has no cycles, the only possibility is: schooling

comes first, followed by On, work, and then retirement.!! We
therefore call this the "normal" life cycle, and this section is
devoted to examining its properties.

6.1 Phase I: Schooling
Since A is rising through time during Phase I, and
v'(l—h)

(20.1)

A

it is clear that h(t) > 0. That is, the amount of time devoted
to schooling rises steadily as education progresses -- a prediction

to which all former graduate students will doubtless attest. The
intuition behind this is simply that the value (in utils) of the
human capital stock A( t )

rises

(even if K itself falls), making

leisure more expensive)1
We may also make some rough judgments on the concavity of

the hours profile, h(t). Differentiating (20.1) logarithmically
gives:

____

- -

Lv'(t)J -A—p.
is actually not quite so obvious, since the diagram makes
it look as though retirement might come first. However, we show
in Section 7 that the same conditions that preclude cycling .also
preclude early retirement.

'Marginal calculations during this phase involve only leisure
and schooling. The work activity is dominated.

-31Denote

the expression in brackets by R(h) > 0, and take the time

derivative again to get:
R'(h)(h)2 + R(h)h = 0

(24)

It is clear from (24) that h and R' (h) have opposite signs. What

is the likely sign of R'(h)? Noting that the time budget makes

In the case of utility functions for choices involving risk,

the ratio v"(L)/v'() is called the degree of "absolute risk

creasing function of z

(i.e.,

to fall in absolute value as I

rises). While the present model does not discuss risk, it seems
reasonable to suppose that our v(.t) funct.on also has

this

pro-

perty. In that case, (24) implies that h(t) < 0, i.e. that h is

a concave function of time during schooling.!! We take this to

be the leading case. And since in Phase I

6,.2 Phase III: Work

Since there are some formal cimilarities between Phase I
and Phase III, it is convenient to take up next the case of
work with no training.

Here labor supply is governed by the usual condition:

that the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and
consumption goods be equated to the real wage:

Since, by (23), !J/$

so people with high impatience offer increasing amounts of labor
to the market, despite wages which are falling if 6 >

0. Con-

trariwise, persons with more "normal" time discount rates have

diminishing labor supply in Phase III. It cannot be stressed
too much that these contrasting behavior patterns have absolutely
nothing to do with competing "income" and "substitution" effects,

although cross-sectional studies of labor supply might possibly
confound the two phenomena.

From (25) it is clear that the concavity issue is precisely
as it was in Phase I. The sign of Li depends only on the be-

havior of "absolute risk aversion" as £ rises, and the more
attractive utility functions imply i

So lgaritttnic age-wage profiles should be straight lines-in Phase

UI, which are falling, flat, or rising according as 6 is greater
than, equal to, or less than zero.

Finally, consider earning,Y(t) =

h(t)W(t).

We have:

i—n+.—n-a
Yh Wh
If 6 > 0, i.e., if depreciation outweighs economy-wide wage growth,

earnings will surely decline. However, if 6 is sufficiently negative, they may not. But regardless of the slope of the logarithmic
earnings profile, it will certainly be concave if h(t) is:

<0 ifh<0.
6.3 Phase II: an—The-Job-Training
To analyze the behavior of hours of work and investment in

Phase U, it is convenient to transform the differential equations
so that x and

h,

rather than x and p.

are the variables. In (x,h)-

space, Phase II is the open unit square, Phase I is the vertical

line x = 1, Phase III is the vertical line x = 0, and Phase IV is

horizontal axis. (See Figure 8.) In a life—cycle without
cycling, we enter from Phase I and ezit to Phase III.

within Phase II, x(t) is monotonically declining —- a property
which holds in the simple Ben-Pofath [1967] model, and which is
vital if human capital theory is to account for the gross facts.
It also implies that, within Phase II, labor supply rises to a
single peak and then declines -- a pattern which Stafford and
Stephan [1973] took great pains to establish the possibility of.

In our model, it is the only pattern which could ever be optimal
(so long as y > 0).

Of course, if 6 =

both actual and potential wages

reach their peak at the Phase tI-Phase III swItch point, and are

level thereafter. Figure 11 below depicts the tima profiles of
labor supply, human capital, and observed wage rates in Phase II

for 6> 0. The peak in observed earnings, h(t)W(t), must cone
between the peak-in h and the peak in W, though its relation to

the peak in K is unclear. If the 6 = 0 case is a good benchmark,
earnings peak earlier than human capital.

Figure 11 shows wages and

(when wages are higher), and finally falling together (when wages

are again low). Once again we stress that this has nothing whatsoever to do with income and substitution effects —-

6.4 The Complete Life Cycle
Now that we have analyzed each individual phase of the optimal

life cycle, we are in a position to put the results together and
describe the complete age profile of investment, work effort,
earning capacity, wage rates and earnings.

6.4.1 Investment inHuman Capital
We have seen that x(t) is constant et unity during Phase I,

declines monotonically during Phase II, and is constant at zero
during Phase III.

(It is not a meaningful concept in Phase IV.)

To show that x(t) looks as portrayed in Figure 12, we need only

establish that it is continuous. Continuity within Phase II
follows frmediately from the fact that both A (t)
continuous functions of time and that 4,

13.1/ Nothing can be said in general about the concavity of x(t)
within Phase II.

6.4.2 labor Supply
So far we have shown that h(t) is rising in Phase I, continues rising to a peak and then declines in Phase II, and declinos

throughout Phase III. It remains to show that h(t) and h(t) are
both continuous functions of time.

Continuity within each phase is trivial to establish. In
Phase I, v'(l-h) = x(t), A and v' are continuous, and v" <0.
In Phase II, y'(l-h) =

ip(t),

and the exact same argument works.

Finally, in Phase II, we have:

v'(l-h) = Ax +

4ig(x)

and given our assumptions about g(x), both x and g(x)are continuous

functions of

the end of schooling, suggests that Figure 13c is closest to tha
truth.

continuity of x(t). This is not so. x and g(x) wil! display
discontinuous behavior at the sm points in time. We only require that Ax + tpg(x) be continuous. For excpic. optimal x(t)

Collecting all these results, Figure 14 depicts the life-cycle

labor supply profile in the leadizg case: y E r—p+6 > 0, R'(h) >0.
In a word, the profile is smooth (except at retirement), singlepeaked, and has no inflection points.

rate 6 in Phase III -—

the only phase where it is cbservable.

(See Figure 15.)

6.4.4 Actual Wage Rates
Observed wages, of course, are zero until the completion of

schooling and correspond to K(t) in Phase III. During Phase II

we have
log P1(t) = log K(t) + log g(x)

so that the slope of the logarithmic wage profile is:
P1(t) _K(t) K(t)

This will always exceed K/K. Further, since as x + 0 both x and
approach finite limits, the time path of log W(t) will

'Ill. The Question of Cycling

We now tddress ourselves to two important questions which have
thus far been avoided:
(a) When cycling arises, what broad characterization of
the optimal path can be made?

(b)

What meaningful conditions can be derived which exclude the possibility of cycling?

In Section 6, we proved that the optimal trajectory can never
1/

cross itself.— This result enables us to answer the first question,
since it implies that cycles must be "expanding" as in Figure 18,

rather than "contracting". Thus a cycling path can be broken down
into

several "quasi-life—cycles", each beginning with a period of

schooling (with the possible exception of the first). Since the contourri of
constant

wprk effort look like blow-ups of the border of

tirement

region (which is the special case h = 0), with higher

contours

connoting higher

the re-

h, we see that the individual works

during his second "quasi cycle" than in his first. Also,
ha spends more time in Phase II. So, in a program with cycling,
harder

the tine profiles of x(t) and h(t) might look something like
Figures 19 and 20 respectively.
Re can

considering

develop strong conditions which rule out cycles by
the minimum length of time required to complete a

"quasi cycle". If this time exceeds the available life, T,
then cycles are impossible. In particular, we focus on the last

= age of ending last work period (possibly t3 = T).

These four points on the optimal trajectory are indicated in Figure
18.

Consider first the length of the schooling period,

Since

t1-t0.

we are considering a cycling path, we know that:21
h(t0) c y/a = rl-Ô—p

(32)

(See Figure lB.) Furthermore, we know from Figure 8 that:
(33)

h(t1) >

(r+6)/a

Finally, we know that optimal behavior implies that y'(lh) grows
at the exponential rate p in Phase I (see equation (20.1)). Thus
we can derive a minimal time required to pass through Phase I
which will depend on the rate of impatience, the elasticity of
the marginal utility function, and the parameters a, r and 5.

Specifically, since

investment frontier. To derive these bounds, recall our earlier

Again the bound depends on a, r, , and the g(x) function.
Putting these results together, we find that there are boundc

on the minimum lengths of Phases II and UI which are the same for
every individual, and there is a bound for the minimal schooling

period which depends on p. Let p' be the value of p satisfying:

S*(p*) = T

-

- W*.

Then cycling is certainly impossible for persons with p <p*. Since
we know that cycling is only a problem when p c r + 8, a sufficient
(but far from necessary) condition to rule out cycling is: r +

The reader should note that the condition p

5

p* rules out early

retirement in the y > 0 case as well, since the bounds S*(p*), 3*,

and W* apply here as well. In a word, we will never get cycles if

-48-

either p is "larae" (i.e. p >

r

+ 5 ) or p is "small" (i.e., p c o).

If p* < r + 6, there will be an intermediate range in which cyclin3
is possible.

It may

be

interesting to work out a numerical example of these

bounds. Suppose a, which would be the rate of return on human
capital in the case of an infinite lifetime, is 87., while r + 6 is

6%. A simple form for the earnings-investment frontier is the quad-

ratic: g(x) = 1 -

Given these choices, (40) and (41)

can be used to compute: J*

18.3, W'= 7.8. From (34) it is

clear that a facile choice of utility function 1st
v'(L) =

For a rate of impatience of p =

e:t.

.02, (34) gives S = 12.5 as the

minimal schooling period. Adding these, we find that a new
cycle cannot start unless there are more than 38.6 years remaining.''

1'The reader is reminded that these are all weak lower bounds. The
actual anount of time taken by the last quasi cycle is thus strictly
greater (and probably considerably greater) than 38.6 years.

VIII. In Conclusion
We have presented a life-cycle model of the behavior of a
utility-maximizing individual free to allocate his daily time

budget Bmong leisure, work and education. The main

substantive

conclusions are listed in Section 1, and depicted in Figures 12-

17. They need not be rehashed here.
Several generalizations of the analysis imediately come to
mind. More general forms of the human capital production function
could be tried, as could a non—separable utility function. Indeed,
the list of arguments of the utility function could be expanded

to include human capital, or, indeed, nonhuman capital. More important than all these, we imagine, would be allowance for the
capital-market imperfections that severely constrain the choices
of those poorly endowed with financial wealth.

Still, so long as we interpret the results as a benchmark
around which there will surely be deviations (some systcmatic,
some random), there are a number of interesting uses for the model.

First, it may be possible to do the usual kinds of ccmparativc-

dynamic exercises. How would an increase in initial fin2ncial
wealth

alter the optimal plan? What about an increase in initial

human wealth? Row

impatience

sensitive is the optimal plan to the rate of

-- a taste parameter that presumably differs across

people.1! The reader can no doubt think of

marty

similar

questions.

11This question is addressed, in the context of a far simpler model,
by Beach, Maital and Maital [1973].

-50-

While we suspect that most of these can only be answered under
specific functional forms for v(Z) and g(x), some weak results
may hold in greater generality.

Second, tho model can provide the micro-foundation for a
simulation model of the income distribution, along the lines of

Blinder [1974]. The chief conclusion of that work is that the
distribution Of wage rates, talcen there to be exogenous, is the

principal contributor to income inequality. The present model
can generate that distribution endogenously, given assumed distributions of tastes and endowments, and thus can fill what is
perhaps the major gap in the positive theory of income distribution.

Third, the long—rim incidence of various taxes in a world
with human-capital accumulation is virtually unexplored territory.
It seems feasible to incorporate some simple taxes —— such as a
linear income or wage tax -—

into

the model and examine, either

analytically or through simulation, the effects of these programs

of the acquisition of human capital. It could be that humaninvestment responds to taxation more substantially than do hours
of work.

In a word, there are a host of interesting and important
questions which simply cannot be addressed by a life-cycle model
which considers either labor—leisure choices or labor-education

choices, but not both.V By demonstrating the feasibility of

i/For example, if income maximization is the posited goal, a proportional tax (subsidy) on wages cannot possibly alter behavior.

-51-

handling both decisions together, we hope to have hastened the
day when the powerful tools of life-cycle economic theory will
be brought to bear on these issues.

Uniqueness

Notice first that the necessary conditions (l)—(l5) define
a unique (A,*) pair for any (x,h) pair. (The converse is also
true.) It is therefore sufficient to show that the equations
(see eqs. (22) (23) in the text),

(A.l) pA — açt'g(x)h = 0
