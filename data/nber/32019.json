    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the role of Export Credit Agencies\u2014the predominant tool of industrial policy\u2014on firm behavior by using the effective shutdown of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) from 2015-2019 as a natural experiment. We show that a 1% reduction in EXIM trade financing reduces exports in an industry by approximately 5%. The impact on firms' total revenues implies that the export shock has positive pass-through to domestic sales, and firms contract investment and employment. These negative effects for the average firm are amplified by increased capital misallocation across firms as those with higher ex-ante marginal revenue product of capital contract more. We model the effect of EXIM trade financing as lowering two types of input cost wedges: an exporting firm's financing friction, and an importer market friction. We show that both frictions are empirically relevant, indicating that even in well-developed financial markets, the supply of trade financing is plausibly constrained. These results provide a framework for the conditions under which Export Credit Agencies can boost exports and firm growth, and can act as a tool of industrial policy without necessarily leading to a misallocation of resources.\n\n",
