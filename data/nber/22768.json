    "abstract": "\n\nA key role of standard setting organizations (SSOs) is to aggregate information on relevant intellectual property (IP) claims before deciding on a standard. This article explores the firms\u2019 strategies in response to IP disclosure requirements\u2014in particular, the choice between specific and generic disclosures of IP\u2014and the optimal response by SSOs, including the royalty rate setting. We show that firms with a stronger downstream presence are more likely to opt for a generic disclosure, as are those with lower quality patents. We empirically examine patent disclosures made to seven large SSOs, and find results consistent with theoretical predictions.\n\n",
