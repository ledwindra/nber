Policy Options for State Pension Systems and Their Impact on Plan Liabilities

NBER Working Paper No. 16453
October 2010

ABSTRACT
We calculate the present value of state pension liabilities under existing policies, and separately under
policy changes that would affect pension payouts including cost of living adjustments (COLAs), retirement
ages, and buyout schedules for early retirement. Liabilities if plans were frozen as of June 2009 would
be $3.2 trillion if capitalized using taxable municipal curves, which credit states for a possibility of
default in the same states of the world as general obligation debt, and $4.4 trillion using the Treasury
curve. Under the typical actuarial method of recognizing future service and wage increases, liabilities
are $3.6 trillion and $5.2 trillion using municipal curves and Treasury curves respectively. Compared
to $1.8 trillion in pension fund assets, the baseline level of unfunded liabilities is therefore around
$3 trillion under Treasury rates. A one percentage point reduction in COLAs would reduce total liabilities
by 9-11%, implementing actuarially fair early retirement could reduce them by 2-5%, and raising the
retirement age by one year would reduce them by 2-4%. Even relatively dramatic policy changes, such
as the elimination of COLAs or the implementation of Social Security retirement age parameters, would
leave liabilities around $1.5 trillion more than plan assets under Treasury discounting. This suggests
that taxpayers will bear the lion's share of the costs associated with the legacy liabilities of state DB
pension plans.

1 Introduction
The financial soundness of pension systems for state and local government workers has been a
topic of much debate. In recent work Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2009, 2010) have argued that the
use of GASB rules to discount future benefit payments results in present value measures of
liabilities that are too low to reflect the true economic liability faced by state taxpayers. At the
same time, a number of states have enacted changes designed to reduce the liabilities
associated with their pension systems (Snell (2009, 2010)). Most of these changes affect new
employees only, and hence have no impact on standard liability measures, which do not
consider future employees. However, some changes, such as the reductions in the cost of living
adjustments (COLAs) passed by Colorado and Minnesota this year, do affect existing plan
members and hence do affect the economic present value of current state pension liabilities.
In this paper, we examine the present value of state pension liabilities under existing
policies and separately under several sets of hypothetical policy measures. In particular, we
consider changes to COLAs, full retirement ages, early retirement ages, and buyout rates for
early retirement.
As we have pointed out before, the key problem with GASB accounting is the discount
rate. States discount pension liabilities at an expected return on pension plan assets, and that
rate is typically around 8%. Discounting procedures based on the principles of financial
economics require discounting at rates that reflect the riskiness of the liabilities. This means
discounting either with a taxable state‐specific municipal yield curve, which credits states for
the possibility they could default on pension payments, or with a Treasury yield curve, which
presents the benefit payments as default‐free. We review the evidence from Novy‐Marx and
Rauh (2010) that shows that even if benefit accruals owing to future service and salary were
stopped completely, liabilities as of June 2009 would be $3.2 trillion using taxable muni curves
and $4.4 trillion using the Treasury curve. Under the typical actuarial method of recognizing
future service and wage increases, liabilities are $3.6 trillion and $5.2 trillion using municipal
curves and Treasury curves respectively.
Turning to policy changes, we find that incremental changes such as one percentage
point reductions in COLAs or one‐year increases to the retirement age have relatively small
2

effects on total liabilities. Reducing COLAs by a full percentage point reduces liabilities under
Treasury discounting by 11%, while raising retirement ages by one year reduces them by 3‐4%.
We also consider far reaching measures such as the elimination of COLAs or the
implementation of retirement age parameters similar to those used by the private sector or
Social Security. These "drastic" actions are less politically viable than more incremental policy
measures, and their legality in the context of some state constitutions would be in question.
However, even these far‐reaching measures do not come anywhere close to eliminating states'
unfunded legacy liabilities. The largest policy changes we consider still leave pension liabilities,
even under narrow measures based on the age and service of today’s members, around $1.5
trillion more than plan assets under Treasury discounting. Unfunded liabilities are even larger
under broader measures that incorporate some portion of future employee wages and service.
Our analysis considers only partial effects. It does not account for equilibrium changes in
retirement behavior, and doing so is beyond the scope of this paper. To the extent that benefit
reductions impose a wealth shock on employees, employees would respond by working longer,
as leisure is generally viewed as a normal good. On the other hand, if the benefit reductions are
not fully compensated by increases in other forms of compensation, reducing benefit packages
lowers compensation and thus reduces the relative price of leisure. This substitution effect
would give employees incentives to work less, but would likely be small. On balance,
endogenous changes to retirement behavior might well limit the impact that policy measures
can have on state pension liabilities.
Some of the policy options considered in this paper are more politically feasible than
others. A number of states have already enacted changes to retirement ages as well as COLAs,
but the majority of the changes only apply to new hires. States that have made changes that
affect existing workers and retirees are in the minority. Minnesota and Colorado are facing legal
challenges over their COLA reductions, which affect all members. Rhode Island has raised
retirement ages for all employees who are not yet eligible for retirement benefits, and Iowa has
raised the ages for all non‐vested employees.
It must be recognized that each state has a unique constitution and existing body of
statutory law that grant different protections to benefits (Brown and Wilcox (2009)), so that the
3

feasibility of different measures varies substantially across states. Changes of smaller
magnitudes are likely to face fewer challenges than changes of larger magnitudes.
Even some of the incremental options we examine have only been tested to a limited
extent by states. For example, we find that making early retirement actuarially fair reduces
total liabilities by 2‐5% depending on the discounting procedure. This actuarially fair early
retirement entails reducing benefits in the event of early retirement such that the present value
of benefits equals to the present value of the benefits the employee would have received if
they were to delay collecting benefits until the normal retirement age. Vermont has
implemented a system where early retirement penalties will be assessed on an actuarial basis
for workers below a certain age and service threshold. Iowa Public Employees have moved from
3% to 6% actuarial reductions per year, which goes in the direction of reducing liabilities but
still allows early retirement under actuarially generous conditions. We are not aware of any
state other than Vermont that has implemented actuarially fair early retirement, despite the
fact that such changes might well prove politically viable. Generous retirement options may in
some cases also actually save the states money. State workers generally enjoy much higher
levels of job security than their public‐sector counter‐parts. Early retirement incentives can
therefore reduce states total liabilities when used to encourage the retirement of employees
that may not be fired but receive total compensation in excess of their marginal revenue
product.
The policy options considered here all require that existing plan members participate to
varying degrees in bearing the burden of the unfunded legacy liabilities faced by these systems.
These changes affect the distribution of the burden among retirees, public employees, and
taxpayers. To the extent that the benefits before the changes were truly the property of plan
members, the policy options could be viewed as simply transferring wealth from public
employees (and in some cases retirees) to taxpayers who are currently liable for the unfunded
pension debt.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the sample and existing measures of
state liabilities under various liability concepts. Section 3 outlines the potential policy measures
we consider, and discusses some other policy options that are outside of the model. Section 4
4

explains how the calculations of policy changes are implemented in the context of our model.
Section 5 discusses the results for single and multiple (or “complex”) policy changes. Section 6
concludes.
2 State Pension Liabilities
This section describes the sample for this paper, and reviews existing work on liability concepts
and methodologies for estimating the economic magnitude of these liabilities.
2.1 Sample
The sample consists of 116 state‐sponsored pension funds used in Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2009,
2010). This is a unique database on 116 state government pension plans built from government
reports. It includes all plans with more than $1 billion of assets that are sponsored by state
governments, identified using the U.S. Census of Governments. The data on plan liabilities were
collected from the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs) of each plan.
Re‐discounting of cash flows under different actuarial accrual concepts and different
yield curves requires an estimate of the cash flows themselves. Unfortunately, the state
governments do not provide the cash flows that they use to derive the liabilities that they
report. To derive estimates of cash flow streams based on the information provided in the
CAFRs therefore requires a calibrated model and a series of assumptions. We explain the
calibration itself in section 4. Some of these require additional data, which we explain here.
One required input is a set of matrices that reflect assumptions about salaries, years of
service, and separation probabilities by age for active workers. In particular, we require a vector
of salary growth by age; a vector of separation probabilities by age; the distribution of plan
participants by age and years of service (an “age‐service matrix”), and the average wages of
employees in each cell. To derive these inputs, we examined the CAFRs of the 10 states with
the largest total liabilities and took the assumptions from the reports where they were usable:
New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas.
For retired workers, we employ a distribution of retirees by age and the average annuity
benefit in each age category. This information is only sporadically disclosed, but by randomly
sampling the CAFRs we obtained an average distribution across 10 plans covering
approximately 1.2 million retirees out of the 6.8 million annuitants. The plans that we could
5

find that disclose this information are the Massachusetts Public Employees, Georgia Employees
Retirement System, Illinois Teachers Retirement System, Florida Retirement System, Ohio
Teachers Retirement System, Tennessee Consolidated Retirement Systems, Pennsylvania
School Employees Retirement System, Louisiana State Employee Retirement System, New York
State Employee Retirement System, and the Arizona Retirement System.
2.2 Liability Concepts
There are four different liability concepts that we consider: Accumulated Benefit Obligation
(ABO), Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), Entry Age Normal (EAN), and Projected Value of
Benefits (PVB). We describe these concepts in this section.
The narrowest measure is the ABO. It reflects benefits already promised and accrued. In
other words, even if the pension plans could be completely frozen, states would still
contractually owe these benefits. The ABO is not affected by uncertainty about future wages
and service, as the cash flows associated with the ABO are based on information known today:
plan benefit formulas, current salaries and current years of service. One source of uncertainty
in the ABO is inflation, and in particular the magnitude of COLA adjustments in states where
COLAs are linked to official statistics such as CPI inflation.
The ABO is often thought of as a “termination liability,” i.e. the liability that would be
owed today even if plans were frozen completely or all workers were fired. In fact, the ABO
actually could be somewhat less than a termination liability, as it assumes an employee does
not start taking benefits until his retirement date, which might be later than the full retirement
age. A termination liability assumes that employees will take benefits at the earliest
advantageous date, which typically will be earlier than the full retirement age given the fact
that actuarial adjustments for early retirement are generally less than actuarially fair.
If workers receive their marginal product in total compensation (wages plus pension
benefits), the ABO is the only concept that should be considered since it measures the benefits
that employees have actually earned (Bulow (1982), Brown and Wilcox (2009)). The ABO is a
“narrow” measure in that it does not recognize any future wage increases or future service that
employees are expected to provide, even though such wage increases and service are to some

6

extent predictable. Moreover, the ABO obligation is independent of wage risk, which simplifies
the valuation.
The three broader measures (PBO, EAN, and PVB) all account to varying extents for the
fact that benefits will continue to accrue due to the future salary and/or service of existing
workers. They assume that the pension system will not be frozen today and all aim to reflect
some portion of actual expected benefits.
The broadest measure, the PVB, represents a discounted present value of the full
projection of the cash flows actuaries expect the state to owe. The PVB method does not credit
the state for the fact that it might have some ability to limit benefit accruals. Both the EAN and
the PBO recognize a fraction of the PVB. The PBO and the EAN are therefore intermediate
measures between the ABO and the PVB.
The PBO accounts fully for expected future wage increases for existing workers, but not
expected future service. Mathematically, the PBO formula recognizes the PVB in a way that is
prorated by service. Note that FASB accounting for publicly traded corporations requires the
calculation of a PBO.
The EAN is broader than the PBO, but not as broad as the PVB. Mathematically, the EAN
method recognizes the PVB in proportion to discounted wages earned to date relative to
discounted expected lifetime wages. In practice, this procedure accounts for some portion of
future benefit accruals due to both wages and future service.
Table 2 summarizes the liability concepts. Further details, including formulas, are
provided in Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2010). We note that none of these methods account for the
expected benefits that will be owed to workers who have not yet been hired.
2.3 Estimates of Liabilities in Previous Literature
Most estimates of liabilities that are not conducted by economists simply add up the liabilities
that are disclosed in the CAFRs. This method ignores two issues. First, it relies strictly on the
liability concept that state actuaries choose. In practice, most liabilities in the CAFRs are stated
under the EAN method, and it is instructive to be able to calculate liabilities under the other
methods, particularly the ABO and the PVB. Second, adding liabilities disclosed in the CAFRs
takes as given whatever discount rate the state actuaries have chosen.
7

As explained in Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2009, 2010), the discount rate the states use
under GASB accounting procedures does not reflect the risk of the liabilities. States discount
the liabilities at a flat rate, and usually this rate is very close to 8%. Of the 116 plans in the
sample, 54 of them use a flat 8% rate, and 112 use a rate between 7.5% and 8.5%.1 States
justify their discount rates with the argument that they are discounting liabilities at the
expected rate of return on the assets in their pension fund. Such a procedure ignores the risk of
the assets completely and treats returns above the risk‐free rate as a free lunch.
The state procedures have survived criticism in part because observers have noted that
many pension systems have earned average returns of around 8% over the past decades. But
again, this assumes that the 8% was obtained without any risk. In fact, these returns were
obtained by taking investment risk, and if the assets had not returned 8%, state taxpayers
would have been on the hook for additional shortfalls. If systems want to be able to tell their
employees that the benefit stream is safer than a portfolio of stocks and bonds, they should
discount the cash flows in a way that reflects that safety.
Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2010) employ two primary discounting procedures. The first uses
the taxable muni rate, defined as the state‐specific (or where unavailable the rating category‐
specific) municipal yield grossed up for a tax preference on muni debt that we estimate to be
25%. The second method uses the Treasury yield curve.
Using the muni rate admits and quantifies a probability of default. The liability is a
measure that calculates the present value of this defaultable liability from the perspective of
the taxpayers under the assumption that the state will default on these payments in the same
states of the world as on their general obligation debt and with the same recovery rates.
Alternatively, it is the value of the portfolio of state GO bonds the state would need to deliver
to the plan to defease the obligation. When assessing the difference in the liability under
different policy measures, the comparative statics quantify how big the shift is in the value of
these uncertain payments.
Using the Treasury yield curve values the pension benefits as secure promises. The
Treasury valuations begin from the premise that the benefits will be paid. To the extent that
1

The proposals outlined in GASB (2010) would basically maintain this system, with muni rate discounting kicking
in only for liabilities that are not fully funded under the expected return on assets system.

8

they are not paid, there is a transfer from participants to taxpayers. The expected value of
these transfers would reduce the value of the payments to the participants but also reduce the
cost to the taxpayer. The Treasury discounting can therefore be viewed as valuing the benefits
as a default‐free promise. If state pension systems want to present to their employees the idea
that the benefits are default‐free, they must discount at default‐free rates. If a state pension
system wanted to contract out the provision of the benefits to an insurer who would make the
benefit payments even if the state in the future defaulted on some of its obligations, the
insurance company would presumably value the liability at a default‐free rate.
Our measures are summarized in Table 3. Under state‐chosen discount rates, the EAN
liability is $3.15 trillion at a measurement date of June 2009. This is very close to liabilities one
would obtain by simply adding up the latest state disclosures, since most state systems use the
EAN method.2 Discounting only the cash flows associated with the ABO lowers the liability to
$2.76 trillion, whereas discounting the full expected value of cash flows (still under state‐
chosen rates) results in a liability of $3.75 trillion.
The second and third columns in Table 3 show the results under taxable muni
discounting and Treasury discounting respectively. Under the ABO, taxable muni liabilities are
$3.20 trillion and Treasury liabilities are $4.43 trillion. Under the EAN, the most common
accrual method used by states, the taxable muni liabilities are $3.62 trillion and the Treasury
liabilities are $5.28 trillion. Under the PVB, the taxable muni liabilities are $4.24 trillion and the
Treasury liabilities are $6.86 trillion.
As of June 2009, we estimate that states had $1.89 trillion in assets set aside in pension
funds dedicated to meet these obligations. Under the ABO, this means that there is a gap
between assets and liabilities of $1.31 trillion under taxable muni discounting and $2.54 trillion
under Treasury discounting. These statistics suggest that existing assets fall substantially short
of the present value of existing promised liabilities.
Furthermore, states have been funding under the EAN accrual method, which sets aside
more money earlier in the employee’s career than funding under the ABO would, but less
2

The raw sum of CAFR liabilities regardless of the reporting date was $3.03 trillion. Using the weighted-average
growth rate of the reported plans to extrapolate for missing data and harmonizing all plans to a June reporting date
yielded a total June 2009 liability of $3.14 trillion on a stated basis. See Internet Appendix Table I of Novy-Marx
and Rauh (2010) for details.

money later. It thus seems fair to compare EAN liabilities to existing assets. Under the EAN
measure, the unfunded liability in state pension plans is $1.73 trillion under taxable muni
discounting and $3.39 trillion under Treasury discounting.
The final two columns apply a 51bp correction for the possibility that salaries are
correlated with market pricing factors over long horizons. Benzoni et al (2007) argue that while
the correlation between earnings growth and stock returns is negligible on a short horizon, the
correlation is higher on a longer horizon. Lucas and Zeldes (2006) discuss these effects in the
context of corporate pension plans with a model in which the value of human capital and the
value of the stock market have positive covariance. The 51bp correction comes from a simple
calibration discussed in Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2010). The correction is only applied to active‐
worker liabilities under the accrual concepts that recognize some future salary or service. It
therefore does not affect the ABO at all, and it does not affect the retired or separated worker
liabilities. This correlation does not substantially affect inference about the magnitude of
liabilities.
An alternative methodology is provided by Biggs (2010), in which taxpayers’ liability is
valued as a put option with a strike price equal to the actuarial liability grossed up at stated
discount rates as in Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2008). Given how far in the money this put option is,
its value is almost equivalent (mechanically) to discounting the liability at the risk‐free rate and
subtracting off the value of the assets. As noted in Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2008), “the cost of the
[taxpayer] insurance is almost as large as the funding shortfall because the value of the
potential overfunding is trivial relative to the potential underfunding.”3
3 Potential Policy Measures
In this section we discuss the potential policy measures that we consider to try to address
shortfalls in state pension funding.
3.1 Full Retirement Age

3

To be precise, Novy-Marx and Rauh (2008) found that the present value of the possibility that pensions could end
up overfunded, if there assets' performance greatly exceeds their expected returns, is only worth $16 billion today.
The surplus would only come in low marginal utility states of the world. This means that even if the government is
unlikely to squander any overfunding (or promise it to beneficiaries as in Bodie (1990)), the value of that possible
overfunding , taking the state pricing into account, is almost trivial to taxpayers.

10

The first policy change we analyze is an increase the age of "full retirement," i.e., the
age at which a retiree can begin taking payments without incurring a benefit reduction. This
change, which does not affect current annuitants, may prove politically feasible although few
states have actually raised retirement ages for existing workers. Changes to the retirement age
are currently being phased in to Social Security. They have also been implemented by some
state plans, though at the state level these changes have been written to affect new workers
only, and thus have no impact on the pension liabilities of the current work force. The
implementation we consider applies to current as well as future workers, and also applies to
the vested separated workers not yet receiving benefits. We model a one year increase in the
full retirement age by assuming that participants are eligible to receive full benefits at the age
of 61, not 60, and that they are first eligible to receive early retirement with reduced benefits at
56, not 55.
We do not attempt to quantify the impact of this policy change (or any other) on
workers retirement behavior. Changes in retirement behavior may have additional effects on
the liability as measured by the broader liability concepts (PBO, EAN, PVB), but would have only
a third‐order effect on the ABO liability.
3.2 Actuarially Fair Early Retirement, or No Benefits Until Full Retirement Age
Another policy change affecting the retirement age, which has been less discussed but
maybe politically feasible, is an adjustment to the rules governing early retirement. Currently
the plans also allow for early retirement on terms that are extremely favorable to plan
participants. The most common rules allow a plan participant to begin taking benefits up to five
years early, by incurring the 6 percent per year linear reduction in the benefit they receive for
each year they retire before the full retirement age, and some plans offer early retirement on
terms that are even more generous to plan participants. Because COLAs, which average
between two and a half and three percent per year, do not apply to retirees' benefits until they
are taking payments, the effective cost of early retirement is only a benefit reduction of three
to three and a half percent per year. That is, a participant can get an extra year of benefits in
exchange for a reduction in future benefits of three to three and a half percent. This is roughly
half the market value of an immediate life annuity for a sixty year old man, or two‐thirds the
11

cost of an immediate joint life annuity for a sixty year old married couple, suggesting that plans
reward each year of early retirement with a "gift" equal to roughly four to six months worth of
benefit payments.
Actuarially fair early retirement involves a benefit reduction formula for early
retirement that equates the expected present value of benefits under early and regular
retirement. Because actuarially fair early retirement means, by definition, that the NPV of
expected benefit payments is unaffected by early retirement, the simplest way to consider the
impact of AFER on pension liabilities is to assume participants do not retire early, i.e., by setting
the early retirement age equal to the full retirement age. We assume again that this policy
change applies to current as well as future workers, and also the vested separated workers not
yet receiving benefits. It of course has no impact on the annuitants.
The cost of the early retirement option to the employer, which is also the value of the
early retirement option to the employees, does depend on the discount rate. The early
retirement option is particularly valuable under high discount rates, because early retirement
gives the employee early, largely undiscounted cash flows in exchange for giving up some later,
heavily discounted cash flows. Higher discount rates hardly reduce the value of the benefit of
the early cash flows, but greatly reduce the value of the foregone later cash flows, increasing
the net benefit of early retirement. We therefore would expect to find an implementation of
AFER affecting liabilities more under discount rates that reflect greater degrees of risk. 4
3.3 COLA Reductions
COLA reductions are one of the only policy measures available that have the potential to
force current annuitants, as well as current and future workers, to bear some of the burden
associated with the current funding situation. This makes them attractive in some ways,
because retirees are the biggest beneficiaries of the legacy liabilities, and some feel that they
should share some of the costs. They may be difficult to implement politically, however, as legal
protections in many states prevent measures that impair the value of pension promises, and
public employee unions are especially resistant to measures that damage the claims of their
4

For example, a 6% buyout rate is very actuarially generous under stated or muni rates, but it is closer to actuarially
fair under risk-free rates. In a rough estimate, a 6.5% buyout rate would appear actuarially fair under Treasury
discounting.

12

senior membership. In at least two states (Colorado and Minnesota) laws have been passed
that entail modest COLA reductions for even current annuitants. These currently face legal
challenges, but seem likely to hold up in court, and are popular with taxpayers in the states in
which they have been passed.5
3.4 Dramatic Measures: Moving to Social Security Retirement Ages
We also consider several more dramatic changes, which shift a greater portion of the
legacy liability from taxpayers to plan participants. The first of these involves bringing the rules
governing retirement into line with the private sector, by raising the full retirement age to 65
and making early retirement actuarially fair. The second additionally reduces COLAs by one
percent per year. The last considers policy changes that bring the retirement rules closer to
those currently governing Social Security, a full retirement age of 67 and early retirement that is
close to actuarially fair.6
3.5 Extreme Measures: Cutting COLAs Completely
To our knowledge, no state has eliminated COLAs completely for any plans. At least one
state, Georgia, has eliminated COLAs for new workers, with the explicit intent of protecting
existing and legacy benefits.7 Illinois has capped COLAs at half of CPI for new workers. Such a
measure clearly taxes new employees relative to the previous baseline in order to subsidize
existing employees and existing retirees. Dramatic COLA reductions are extremely effective in
reducing the states' obligations, because COLAs affect annuitants as well as workers, and

5

Anecdotally, at least some unions and public officials seem to understand that taxpayers are bankrolling generous
retirement plans. For example, a Minnesota executive director of a public employee union has been quoted in the
Wall Street Journal as saying that his board was accepting COLA reductions for current retirees so that “we don't
kill the goose that lays that golden egg” (Neumann (2010)).
6
Specifically, we allow early retirement as early as age 62, but use a linear buyout schedule with a buyout rate six
percent higher than the COLA rate employed by each plan. Social Security uses a non-linear buyout schedule that is
roughly six percent per year, but unlike the state plans has COLAs, tied to wage growth, that apply prior to the date
one begins receiving benefits. On this dimension Social Security is more generous than the state plans, and the fact
that the unions do not seem particularly interested in fighting for COLAs that apply prior to the date of the first
benefit payment suggests that they do not well represent plan participants, either current or future, that are separated
and vested but not receiving benefits.
7
“The General Assembly is desirous of providing an established annual cost-of-living adjustment to all current
active and retired members of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia, the Georgia Legislative Retirement
System, and the Georgia Judicial Retirement System. In order to do so, limiting future liability of the systems by
adjusting the retirement expectations of persons who are newly employed is a regrettable but necessary step toward
fiscal soundness.” (Georgia House Bill 452/ Act 82). The bill passed the House March 9, 2009 (157-0), passed the
Senate March 26, 2009 (35-10) was signed by the governor, and went into law on July 1.

13

increase the states' liability by roughly a third relative to what they would be absent COLAs. For
this same reason drastic COLA reductions may be infeasible politically.
3.6 Other Measures Outside the Model
Several states have taken steps over the last two years that attempt to address their pension
funding shortfalls, using policy changes that are outside the scope of our model. These steps
include rules to prevent "spiking" (large end of career salary increases that increase lifetime
pension benefits), employee contribution increases, increases in vesting periods, and limits on
benefit payments.
Virginia and Rhode Island have increased from three to five the number of years used to
calculate the final average salary (FAS), while Georgia, Colorado and Vermont have capped the
increases in salaries that count toward benefit calculations. Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Vermont and Wyoming have increased employee pension
contributions for both current and future employees, while New Hampshire and Texas have
increased these for new employees only. While these increases do not reduce the states' future
pension liabilities, they do divert a portion of workers' salary into the pension fund, thereby
increasing the fund assets and thus improve the funding situation.8 Iowa, Minnesota, and
Missouri have increased the length of time an employee must work to be eligible for the states'
DB plans. These changes have almost no impact, qualitatively, as workers that separate without
vesting tent to be young, and the value of their benefits, had they vested, would have been
extremely small anyway because the plans’ COLAs do not apply until retirement. Michigan and
Illinois have introduced dollar caps on the FAS that may be used in some plans benefit
calculations.

4 Implementation of Policy Changes in the Model
In order to determine the impact of these policy changes on states' pension liabilities,
we forecast each plan's cash flows to plan participants using information from the plans' CAFRs.
We calibrate these so that each plan's liability under its chosen accounting methodology,
8

These contribution increases force younger workers, and especially new employees, to subsidize older workers
and the retired. This fact presents a conflict of interests for state workers' unions, which negotiate the

discounted using its stated discount rate, matches the stated liability in its CAFR. Policy changes
are then implemented in this model, and the impact of these changes on the states' pension
liabilities can be quantified under any accounting methodology using any discount rates.
The initial calibration proceeds as in Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2010), which provides a more
detailed account of the methodology. The first step of this calibration employs our model to
forecast each plan's liabilities each year in the future. The model uses plan level information
regarding the number of active, retired and separated workers, as well as the benefit factor
(i.e., the fraction of salary which, when multiplied by years of service, determines a participant's
initial benefit), cost of living adjustment (COLA) and inflation assumption employed by the plan.
It also employs assumptions regarding the relative number of employees and average wages by
age and years of service (an “age‐service matrix”), as well as salary growth and separation
probabilities by age, and the relative number and average level of benefits for annuitants of
each age. The benefit calculations assume a full retirement age of 60, and that younger retirees
can start taking benefits up to five years early by incurring a linear 6% benefit reduction for
each year a participant retires before 60.9
Benefits are projected assuming mortality rates from the RP‐2000 tables, which are
employed by many states. We use the tables' combined (employee/retired) healthy rates, and
assume that participants are evenly divided by gender, that 60 percent are married at the time
they retire to a spouse of the same age, and that plans allow for 50 percent survivor benefits.
We then calibrate each plan's cash flows by adjusting the average salary level of the
employed and the average benefits of the non‐active members. They are calibrated to
simultaneously match both 1.) the plan’s stated accounting liability when capitalized at the
state‐chosen discount rate using the actuarial method (EAN or PUC) employed by the state; and
2.) the plan’s expected first year cash flow, which we estimate at 107% of the cash flow for the
year ending June 2009, based on recent historical cash flow growth.
The model, using the calibrated average salary level of the employed workers and the
calibrated average benefits of the non‐active members, together with the parameters used in
9

This benefit reduction schedule is common practice in state public pension systems, and if anything conservative;
the Florida Retirement System uses a 5% reduction for each year below the full retirement age, while the New
Jersey Public Employees and Teachers systems use 1-3% reduction for each year.

15

the calibration, serves as our "baseline." We investigate the impact of each of the different
policy changes discussed earlier by altering the parameters employed by the model in a manner
consistent with the policy changes, and using it to generate the plans' new forecast liabilities.
These can then be capitalized, under whichever accounting concept we wish to employ, using
either the taxable muni yield curve or the Treasury yield curve.

5 Results
The first part of this section considers the policy changes that only affect one pension plan
parameter. The second part considers more complex changes that affect multiple dimensions
of the system parameters.
5.1 Single Policy Changes
Table 5 shows the effect of single policy changes under taxable muni discounting. Table
6 shows the effect under Treasury discounting. The first column of each table shows the
baseline results without any policy changes, as a point of comparison. Figure 1 shows a
graphical representation.
The second columns of Tables 5 and 6 show the effects of a one percentage point COLA
reduction for all system members (including current retirees) on liabilities under taxable muni
and Treasury discounting respectively. Under taxable muni discounting, the effect on the total
ABO is a decrease of $280 billion, of which the annuitant portion is $160 billion or around 60%.
Under Treasury discounting, the effect on the total ABO is a decrease of $470 billion, of which
the annuitant portion is $220 billion or around 50%.
Overall, a one percentage point COLA reduction lowers the liability measures by almost
9% under the taxable muni discounting and by almost 11% under Treasury discounting. The
percentage effect is larger for active participants than for annuitants in both cases. COLA
reductions have a more immediate effect on annuitants, but this is offset by the fact that COLA
reductions will affect current workers on average for a longer time. Current workers have their
full retirement ahead of them with decreased COLAs, while current annuitants face only the
future part of it with decreased COLAs. Note that reducing COLAs reduces the effective
duration of the liabilities.
16

The third columns of Tables 5 and 6 show the liabilities if AFER is implemented. The first
thing to note is that this policy change does not change the annuitant liability at all, since these
participants are already retired. Implementing AFER reduces active participant liability by 8‐9%
under taxable muni discounting, but by only 2‐3% under Treasury discounting. The effect on
total liabilities is even more muted because of the zero impact on the annuitant liability.
Overall, implementing AFER reduces total liabilities by 3‐5% under taxable muni discounting but
only 1‐2% under Treasury discounting.
Implementing AFER would therefore generate lower liabilities under stated discount
rates and also under taxable muni rates. But if the pension promises are default‐free,
implementing AFER does not affect the value of the liability nearly as much. It is instructive to
compare these effects to potential changes in the FRA under the ABO accrual method. The
generosity of the buyout schedule for early retirement is worth more than a 1/2 year reduction
in the FRA under risk free discounting, but almost 1 1/2 years under taxable muni discounting.
The fourth columns of Tables 5 and 6 show the impact of increasing the retirement ages
(both the FRA and the ERA) by one year. Relative to the baseline, total liabilities are reduced by
around 2‐4%. The broader measures (e.g. PVB) are affected more than the narrower measures
(e.g. ABO). This policy measure does not affect annuitants, so the decreases in liabilities are
achieved largely at the expense of the current workers. In the next section we consider the
effects of more dramatic retirement age increase.
The final column shows what would happen to liabilities if COLAs were eliminated
entirely. The reduction is around 22% under taxable muni discounting and 26% under Treasury
discounting. The elimination of COLAs would still leave ABO liabilities at $3.27 trillion under
Treasury discounting. The gap between assets and ABO liabilities would still be almost $1.5
trillion, and the gap between assets and EAN liabilities would be $2 trillion.
5.2 Multiple Policy Changes
Tables 7 and 8 show the effects of the multiple policy change packages on liabilities, and
Figure 2 shows a graphical representation. The effects of both increasing the retirement ages by
one year and implementing actuarially fair early retirement is to reduce liabilities by 6%‐9%
under taxable muni discounting and 4‐6% under Treasury discounting. As was the case above, if
17

the pension promises are default‐free, implementing AFER does not affect the value of the
liability as much as under the taxable muni discounting. The effects of combining these two
policy changes are slightly larger than the sum of the percentage effects of the two effects
separately. This is because of the interaction between the two policy measures.
Setting the full retirement age and early retirement age both to 65 reduces liabilities by
15‐24%. The effect is greater under the taxable muni discounting, for the same reasons that
introducing actuarially fair early retirement is greater under taxable muni discounting. Setting
both retirement ages to 65 is equivalent to an increase in the retirement age combined with
the introduction of early retirement. Reducing the COLA by 1 percentage point and setting both
retirement ages to 65 reduces liabilities by 23‐30%. Moving to the Social Security parameters
reduces them by 22‐31%. In all of these cases, the reduction is greater for the broader
measures than for the narrower measures.
All of these policy measures still leave substantial gaps between assets and liabilities.
Even under a move to Social Security parameters, which would be the most drastic of these
measures, the ABO at Treasury rates is still $3.38 trillion, leaving a gap between assets and
liabilities of $1.5 trillion.
6. Conclusions
The notion that the historical equity premium provides a costless solution is incorrect. Even
under the most conservative measures, public pension liabilities are currently over $1 trillion
larger than plan assets. Using discount rates that actually reflect the promise reveals shortfalls
of $2.5 billion for accumulated benefits only and over $3 trillion for broader measures. This
shortfall has to be borne by some party: taxpayers or public employees, be they past, current,
or future.
In essence, then, the debate over the solution is over transfers. The current situation is
one in which beneficiaries view their benefits as secure promises and taxpayers do not perceive
that they will be held accountable for guaranteeing those promises.
Each of the policy changes we consider reflects a reduction in perceived wealth felt by a
group of participants. Almost all of them would fall under the category of "good starts" for
addressing states' underfunded pension liabilities. However, we show that there is no "magic
18

bullet" as far as policy changes are concerned. Even implementing Social Security parameters,
and under the relatively narrow accounting of the ABO, the difference between assets and
liabilities is still $1.5 trillion. We speculate that taxpayers will likely not succeed in forcing public
employees to bear the rest of this gap, and that ultimately taxpayers will have to come up with
sums of this magnitude to pay for legacy liabilities. If unfunded liabilities continue to grow, the
bailouts could be even larger.
The examination of the impact of policy changes on liabilities in this paper is done in
partial equilibrium. We have not modeled any endogenous responses by workers in their
retirement behavior. We have assumed that these changes can be imposed on workers without
being offset by any other changes that might increase the liability. We have not analyzed the
plan characteristics that might make the liabilities of some plans more sensitive to these policy
changes than others. Finally, we have not modeled any cost savings that early retirement might
achieve for states if workers close to retirement are compensated more than their marginal
product. These are important avenues for future research.

Table 2: Description of Methods for Recognizing Accrued Liabilities
This table summarizes the four main methods for recognizing pension liabilities. The methods differ in their
treatment of expected future salary increases and service that is yet to be performed. The methods are listed in
increasing order of broadness, starting with the method that only reflects current service and salary and ending
with the method that reflects a full projection of benefits that are expected to be paid.

Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO)

Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO)

Entry Age Normal (EAN)

Present Value of Benefits (PVB)

Represents promised benefits under current salary
and years of service. Often used interchangeably
with the concepts of “termination liability,” or
liability if the plan were frozen, although there are
some differences (see text).
Takes projected future salary increases into
account in calculating today’s liability, but not
future years of service. Used in FASB accounting
for corporations.
Reflects a portion of future salary and service by
allowing new liabilities to accrue as a fixed
percentage of a worker’s salary throughout his
career.
Full projection of what current employees are
expected to be owed if their salary grows and they
work/retire according to actuarial assumptions.

Table 3: Summary of Baseline Results from Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2010)
This table reviews and summarizes the baseline results from Novy‐Marx and Rauh (2010). Liabilities are measured
as of June 2009 . The first column shows the present value of liabilities under state‐chosen rates. The second
column shows liability discounted at taxable muni rates, based on taxable municipal zero‐coupon yield curves as of
June 30, 2009. The municipal yield curves are state‐specific where available, otherwise they are matched to the
rating categories of the states, and the tax adjustment is done by grossing up yields by 25%. The third column
discounts the cash flows using the Treasury zero‐coupon yield curve as of June 30, 2009. The fourth column
discounts with the taxable muni rate plus a 51bp salary risk premium, and the last column discounts with the
Treasury rate plus a 51bp salary risk premium. The salary risk premium is only added to the active worker
component, and it is also not added to the ABO since the ABO is invariant to future salary growth. See Novy‐Marx
and Rauh (2010) for further details.
