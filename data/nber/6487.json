More specifically, this paper underscores the fundamental role of reinforcement in the genesis and maintenance of cocaine use and explores how reinforcement and consumer-demand theory might be translated into effective strategies for reducing cocaine use.  A broad range of relevant research findings are discussed, including preclinical studies conducted with laboratory animals, laboratory and treatment-outcome studies conducted with cocaine abusers, and large epidemiological studies conducted with national samples of the U.S. population.\n\n",
