    "abstract": "\n\nUnder current U.S. tax law, a distinction is made between gains and losses by businesses. Losses that must be \"carried forward\" are subject to two penalties: a loss of interest, and expiration after fifteen years. Previous examinations have focused on the higher expected tax payments such a tax system without \"full loss offset\" imposes on risky projects.This paper presents a dynamic analysis of the impact of taxation on investment when gains and losses are treated asymmetrically. The results provide a basis for analyzing recent tax changes, particularly the controversial\"safe-harbor leasing\" provisions of the 1981 tax legislation.\n\n",
