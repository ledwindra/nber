There is a growing consensus that much of the LDC debt will not be fully serviced in the future, and that consensus is reflected in at least two ways: in the discounts observed in the secondary market prices for LDC debt, and in the discounts in the stock market pricing of banks with exposure in the LDCs.\n\n",
