    "abstract": "\n\nPublic employment programs may a\ufb00ect poverty both directly through the income they provide and indirectly through general-equilibrium e\ufb00ects. We estimate both e\ufb00ects, exploiting a reform that improved the implementation of India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) and whose rollout was randomized at a large (sub-district) scale. The reform raised bene\ufb01ciary households\u2019 earnings by 14%, and reduced poverty by 26%. Importantly, 86%of income gains came from non-program earnings, driven by higher private-sector (real) wages and employment. This pattern appears to re\ufb02ect imperfectly competitive labor markets more than productivity gains: worker\u2019s reservation wages increased, land returns fell, and employment gains were higher in villages with more concentrated landholdings. Non-agricultural enterprise counts and employment grew rapidly despite higher wages, consistent with a role for local demand in structural transformation. These results suggest that public employment programs can e\ufb00ectively reduce poverty in developing countries, and may also improve economic e\ufb03ciency.\n\n",
