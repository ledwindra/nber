The Total Risk Premium Puzzle

ABSTRACT
The risk premium puzzle is worse than you think. Using a new database for the U.S. and 15 other
advanced economies from 1870 to the present that includes housing as well as equity returns (to
capture the full risky capital portfolio of the representative agent), standard calculations using
returns to total wealth and consumption show that: housing returns in the long run are comparable
to those of equities, and yet housing returns have lower volatility and lower covariance with
consumption growth than equities. The same applies to a weighted total-wealth portfolio, and
over a range of horizons. As a result, the implied risk aversion parameters for housing wealth and
total wealth are even larger than those for equities, often by a factor of 2 or more. We find that
more exotic models cannot resolve these even bigger puzzles, and we see little role for limited
participation, idiosyncratic housing risk, transaction costs, or liquidity premiums.

Introduction

If economics is galvanized by the raw conflict between pure theories and brute facts, then the battle
over the equity premium puzzle has arguably energized as much intellectual warfare as almost
any other empirical anomaly. Over four decades it has stood as a rebuke to many macro-financial
theories, and consumption-based asset pricing in particular, triggering an avalanche of research.1
Thus far, the near-universal reaction has been to come up with more elaborate theories taking
the magnitude of the puzzle as given. This paper is different. We bring new evidence from historical
data to this research agenda along three dimensions. First, international evidence from a wider
spectrum of advanced economies. Second, a longer time span that includes wars, financial and
currency crises, and other rare but dramatic events that greatly influence how one should think
about consumption risk. Finally, we bring in returns to housing, a large category of investable assets
for the representative consumer, getting us closer to a more accurate measure of the investor’s total
wealth portfolio returns and its relation to consumption growth. We focus on measurement and
how alternative theories fare against this new evidence.
Methodologically, the paper follows a long lineage. According to textbook theory, a risky asset
should earn a risk premium, an excess return relative to a safe asset, which depends on the statistical
properties of the risky return and the investor’s discount factor—more specifically the covariance of
the two, as we recap below. As Shiller (1982) demonstrated, by deriving volatility bounds, if the
stochastic discount factor is derived from a standard power utility function, then the high excess
return on equities combined with a plausible risk aversion parameter would imply a discount factor
that was inadmissible as it was many times more volatile than could be generated by actual U.S.
post-WW2 time-series data on consumption. Mehra and Prescott (1985) worked in a two-state model,
and reached a formulation which cast the result in a different light: given a plausible risk aversion
parameter and the measured consumption data, the excess return was inexplicably large, and they
attached to this conundrum its enduring name, the equity premium puzzle.2
A huge literature has tried a variety of approaches to “solve” the puzzle. One major approach
has been to alter the consumption and return data fed into the model. For example, some narrow
the excess return or increase the covariance by various means such as choosing longer-duration safe
assets (U.S. bonds rather than bills), or considering longer spans of pre-WW2 U.S. economic history
where negative skew from “rare disasters” (e.g., the 1930s) change key statistical moments; some
introduce non-U.S. time series data to further address the arguably quite serious small-sample and
survivorship bias derived from studying only the equity market of the global capitalist hegemon
in its heyday. The other major approach has been to alter the model itself, specifically by adding
1 Articles

too numerous to list address the point. For major surveys see Breeden et al. (2015ab), Campbell
(1999; 2005; 2017), Cochrane (2008), Cochrane and Hansen (1992), and Mehra (2008).
2 On the history of thought, Cochrane (2008, 261–266) notes that many papers from that era found
unrealistically high risk aversion was needed to fit consumption-based models to the data, e.g., Grossman and
Shiller (1981), Shiller (1982), Hansen and Singleton (1983), as well as Mehra and Prescott (1985). Cochrane
also offers an interesting discussion of why the latter paper got much more credit than the others.

“exotic” preference assumptions to derive the stochastic discount factor, and to amplify the necessary
moments to achieve a better fit with a plausible level of risk aversion. For example, some impose
habits in consumption, so that changes are penalized more heavily and underlying marginal utilities
become more volatile; some impose recursive preferences and long-run risks to growth.
The central contribution of this paper is to bring insights from the workhorse models to bear
again once we re-measure returns to the hypothetical representative investor’s total portfolio
including both equities and housing. Note that to keep all else equal, our benchmark is the standard
representative agent model. In that model, the equilibrium for the agent is, ipso facto, a buy-andhold, no-trade equilibrium. We take no stand on whether this is the right model of the world, which
is a different discussion. Of course, in reality key assumptions fail: assets trade, transactions costs
intrude, etc. But this is true for equities as well as housing, and we shall take some time to ponder
these issues even if they must be left to a different paper. Rather, our aim is to ask how well this
widely-used canonical model works once returns to wealth are properly measured to include a
proxy for total wealth that includes the hitherto ignored role of housing.
We make that critical but arduous correction and arrive at a striking conclusion. We rely on a
new database for the U.S. and 15 other advanced economies, from 1870 to the present, including
total returns on housing as well as equities (Jordà, Knoll, Kuvshinov, Schularick, and Taylor,
forthcoming). We do standard calculations on returns and consumption and show that housing
returns are comparable to those of equities, and yet housing returns have even lower covariance with
consumption growth than equities. The same also holds for a total wealth portfolio, and over a range
of horizons. In other words, the total risk premium puzzle is even bigger: The implied risk aversion
parameters for housing wealth and total wealth are considerably larger than those for equities alone,
often by a factor of 2 or more. The total risk premium puzzle is even more pronounced than the
equity risk premium puzzle, given the implausibly large degree of risk aversion implied by the data.
The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents summary data to fix facts and set the
scene. Section 3 reviews the key literature on equity risk premiums, while bringing in studies of
housing risk premiums that use the standard asset pricing framework. Section 4 reviews our new
data on housing and equity returns. Section 5 presents our key results: asset pricing moments for
equities, housing, and the total portfolio are computed, and implied risk aversion parameters are
derived. Section 6 shows that several well-known “exotic” variants of the benchmark consumptionbased asset pricing model, which partly resolve the equity premium puzzle, struggle to explain
the housing and total risk premium puzzles uncovered here. This section also discusses potential
deviations from the canonical representative agent model such as limited participation, transaction
costs, idiosyncratic risk, and liquidity, how these factors might not much mitigate the puzzles we
uncover. Section 7 concludes, and poses a question for future research: if asset pricing research has
struggled for decades with equity-return implied risk aversion parameters too large for comfort,
how can we proceed now, confronted with housing-return and total-return implied risk aversion
parameters that are 2 or 3 times larger still?
Our paper opens a new front in the risk premium conflict, with challenging findings for asset

2

pricing research based on a new dataset with unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage for
both key asset returns, equity and housing. A key contribution is not just to highlight that housing
returns are likely to worsen long-standing puzzles in the literature, but to actually quantify how
much worse things get using the near universe of alternative explanations that have been explored
in the literature. Whatever future scholarship decides, our new findings and data will be available
to those who aim to better understand the behavior of returns to wealth.

2.

Total Wealth and Returns: Equity versus Housing at a Glance

The core argument of this paper can be summed up in two statements. First, modern asset pricing
research has been unduly focused on traded equities. This is unfortunate not only because traded
equities are a small and possibly unrepresentative fraction of the total capital invested in enterprises.
The larger problem is that this capital is itself only a fraction of total wealth in the economy, given
the large share of capital consisting of housing wealth. Second, by extension, traded equity returns
may be a poor guide to total wealth returns. Whether or not they are an acceptable proxy for returns
on equity in enterprise capital, returns to housing may have very different statistical properties.
Figure 1 shows that in advanced economies the share of traded equities in total wealth is about
one sixth, and represent about one third of total equity capital invested in enterprises. There is
also a large share of wealth not in enterprises, roughly one half, which is invested in housing. The
putative representative agent owns all of this wealth, not just the small slice in traded equities—but
the mainstream asset pricing literature basically ignores this.
Does this matter? As Table 1 shows, we can now see that this is the case. In the table, Re and
Rh denote the annual gross total real returns on equities and housing, respectively. Total returns
are capital gains plus dividends for equities, and capital gains plus rent (net of depreciation) for
housing, with the real returns then deflated by consumer price inflation. The statistics displayed are
means and standard deviations of net annual returns (in percent), the correlation of the two returns,
and the sample size. The rows correspond to 4 samples, the U.S. and a pooled world sample of 16
advanced economies, for both the full 1870–2015 sample (including wars) and a balanced-panel
post-WW2 sample (starting in 1963).
The key message is that of the two risky assets, housing has been a strong and safe investment,
comparable to equities. In the World full sample, equities have returned 6.7% pa, and housing 6.9%
pa in real terms. In the U.S. full sample, equities have returned 8.5% pa, and housing 6.1% pa. The
standard deviation of equity returns has been large, 19% for the U.S. (22% for the World); but the
standard deviation of housing returns has only been less than half as large, 8% for the U.S. (10% for
the World). Similar findings apply to the Post-WW2 sample. The striking conclusion is that if the
equity premium on its own is a puzzle that is hard to explain, introducing into the representative
investor’s portfolio a second asset class, of equal weight, and with higher returns, lower volatility,
and low correlation to the first, is likely to make the puzzle even bigger. The core of this paper is
devoted to robustly proving this point in the canonical consumption-based asset pricing framework

and its most familiar exotic variants.
Even more significantly, a portfolio composed, as in the real world, of 50-50 equities and housing
would offer significant diversification benefits. The correlation of equity and housing returns
is below 0.34 in the U.S. (0.18 world), and in the Post-WW2 sample it is smaller still, virtually
uncorrelated. This ostensibly low correlation between equity and housing markets has an important
implication. If returns in the equity and housing markets do not co-move closely, the properties
of the diversified market portfolio consisting of the weighted sum of investable assets will be very
different from that of the equity market alone. The CAPM-betas that quantify the systematic risk of
an asset in comparison to the market portfolio will look very different when they are calculated
with the true market portfolio that includes housing as opposed to using the equity market alone.

Theoretical and Empirical Backdrop

Notation and Statistical Preliminaries

Total real returns will be defined as nominal returns deflated appropriately for consumer price
inflation. For any country, let Ri,t+1 be the gross h-period (depending on the periodicity of the data
and the investor’s horizons considered) total real return on a risky asset of type i. Formally,
Return = Ri,t+h =

pi,t+h + yi,t+h
1
,
pi,t
1 + πi,t+h

where yt is the asset’s nominal dividend in period t and pt its nominal price at end of the period.
The h period returns are then cumulated accordingly. We also denote by R f ,t+h the gross h-period
return on a safe asset if type f . Unless otherwise noted we restrict attention to the case h = 1, and
drop the time subscript for clarity. The risky asset types i will be equities (E), housing (H), and a
total (T) consisting of a 50-50 weight of each asset, given the above evidence on the weights of each
asset type in total wealth. The safe assets will be government bills (typically 3-month, or a proxy
short-term instrument) and bonds (typically 5–10 year).
Several summary statistics for raw returns will be of interest and allow a preliminary understanding of the properties of the data. We begin with a focus on a few key moments, namely,

Consumption-Based Asset Pricing

3.2.

To explain some of these moments, we seek to explore how well, or how badly, the standard
framework for consumption-based asset pricing can perform, applied now to housing as compared
to its familiar use for equities. We follow the simplest textbook approach, assuming a power utility
with lognormal returns for tractability. (e.g., Abel 1988; Campbell 1999, 2004; Mehra 2008; Cochrane
2008).
The representative household at any time (e.g., normalized to t = 0), maximizes expected
time-separable utility from per capita consumption ct given by
(

0 < β < 1,

t =0

where, for now, we assume a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) or power utility function with
curvature or risk aversion parameter γ, so that
U (c, γ) =

c 1− γ

0 < γ < ∞.

Intertemporal optimization requires that the discounted marginal utility tomorrow of Ri,t+1 units
should equal the marginal utility of one unit today,

Ri,t+1 .
U 0 (ct )

Applying the same formula to a safe asset return R f ,t+1 (riskless one-period bond) we obtain

1 = βEt

U 0 ( c t +1 )
U 0 (ct )


R f ,t+1 .

Combining these last two expressions with some tedious algebra one can solve for the risk premium.
Specifically, given a CRRA utility, defining gross real per capita consumption growth as gt =
ct+1/ct

, and dropping time subscripts, the theory yields an expression for the risk premium as the

product of the risk aversion parameter and the covariance of returns and consumption growth,

Covariance of returns and

The intuition for this expression is that a risk averse agent will be less willing to hold an asset whose
payoffs more tightly covary with consumption, since this asset will tend to have low payoffs in bad
states of the world. As a result, in equilibrium, they must be compensated with a higher excess
return for bearing this risk.

6

The well-trodden path to the risk premium puzzle is taken by going to the data, computing the
moments on either side of this expression, and solving for the implied risk aversion parameter γ.
Along the way, some additional informative moments can be computed, namely,
S.d. of consumption growth:

When we turn to our empirical work in Section 5, we will discuss the relevance of moments (1)–(2)
and present their empirical values for equity, housing, and total returns using our new panel dataset.
Before that we first review important prior work, which comprises a massive literature devoted
to U.S. and world equity returns, and then discuss the much smaller literature which has applied
the same framework to housing returns. We then briefly discuss the sources and construction of our
new returns database.

3.3.

The Evidence on the U.S. Equity Return Premium

The empirical moments just discussed in expressions (1) and (2) for U.S. postwar equity data have
by now been computed many times and the stylized facts are well known. The basic conundrum
presented in Shiller (1982) and Mehra and Prescott (1985) remains, and is a core feature of textbook
treatments (Cochrane 2000; Campbell 2017).
According to the survey by Campbell (1999) the average U.S. real total equity return from 1947
to 1996 was high at 7.6% pa, and the average riskless rate was low at 0.8% pa based on 3-month
Treasury bills; the implied equity risk premium was thus 6.8% pa. Similar estimates appear in
Campbell (2003). For a more historical comparison, Mehra (2008) reports a range of equity premiums
based on longer run annual data for the U.S. In the longest span sample, 1802 to 2004 due to Ibbotson
and Siegel (1984), the value is 5.4% pa. In the shortest span sample, 1926 to 2004 due to Ibbotson
and Siegel (1984), the value is 8.6%. The Shiller (1982) sample from 1871 to 2005 gives a premium
8.3% and the Mehra-Prescott sample from 1889 to 2005 gives 6.4%. Campbell (1999) reports an
annualized value of 6.7% for 1891 to 1995. A reasonable long-run value of the U.S. annual equity
risk premium in both postwar and longer samples is therefore perhaps around 6.5% pa.
Turning to the correlation of real consumption growth and real equity returns, Campbell (1999)
finds a postwar value of 0.22 in quarterly data, and 0.33 in annual data. Expanding to a U.S.
historical sample from 1891 to 1994 he reports an annual value of 0.45. This higher value presumably
reflects some of the more synchronized stock-consumption episodes in the more turbulent pre-WW2

7

period, especially in the 1920s and 1930s. In addition, he shows that the annualized standard
deviation of real equity returns is 15.5% and that of real consumption growth is 1.1% in quarterly
postwar data. In annual U.S. historical data these figures rise to 18.6% and 3.3%, respectively.
Some results quickly follow. The implied Sharpe ratio for postwar U.S. equities is roughly
(0.068/0.155) or 0.44, annualized. Since the standard deviation of real consumption growth is 0.011,
the Hansen-Jagannathan lower bound for the implied risk aversion parameter is about 40. But this
lower bound is attained if and only if real consumption growth and real returns have a perfect
correlation of 1; in reality, they do not. Empirically, the covariance of real equity returns and real
consumption growth is small: Campbell (1999) shows that it is approximately 0.22 × 0.155 × 0.011
or about 0.0004 in the quarterly postwar data, and appears to be somewhat higher, at 0.45 × 0.186

× 0.033 or about 0.003, in the longer-run annual data. Plugging these values into equation (10)
gives an implied risk aversion parameter of about 150 for U.S. postwar data, and around 20 for
the longer-run data (see his Table 5). The former value is far above a plausible value, which is
considered to be something below 10 (Mehra 2008); even the latter value is still quite high, although
it forcefully illustrates that the puzzle abates when a broader and more volatile period of economic
growth is included in the U.S. sample.

3.4.

International Evidence on the Equity Return Premium

Brown, Goetzmann, and Ross (1995) suggested that results based on U.S. data alone may suffer
from selection bias. A more recent literature (e.g., Jorion and Goetzmann 1999; Campbell 1999,
2000; Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton 2002, 2008; Mehra and Prescott 2003; Mehra 2012) discusses
the international experience in more detail in the context of equity returns alone, but finds that
international differences are few—the equity premium puzzle endures on a global level, and is not
simply a U.S. phenomenon.
Here, research has consistently found a smaller puzzle in the wider international sample,
with notably smaller values for the equity risk premium in long-run samples. The reason is,
perhaps, obvious: the U.S. experience is exceptional, reflecting roughly 150 years without any major
destructive wartime conflict on the U.S. mainland, and no episodes of major political or economic
cataclysm such as coups, revolutions, hyperinflation, or sovereign default. In contrast, many of
today’s so-called Advanced Economies have faced such disruptions within living memory, and these
episodes have in general been very adverse for returns to risky (or even “safe”) assets. Thus, the
empirical moments computed from U.S. data alone might be criticized as being subject to sample
selection, or a type of survivorship bias. The same concerns might also apply to a lesser degree to
the use of U.S. postwar data, where economic growth has been especially tranquil and even in the
pre-2008 samples widely used.
Some typical postwar international results for equity risk premiums can be found in the survey
by Campbell (2003). In his Table 4, some advanced economies, e.g., Canada (3.9%), Italy (4.7%),
and Japan (5.0%), do exhibit lower equity risk premiums than the United States (6.3%) from 1970

8

to the 1990s. But conversely, some other economies have even higher equity risk premiums, e.g.,
Netherlands (11.4%), Sweden (11.5%) and Switzerland (14.9%). Thus, compared to the postwar U.S.
case, the puzzle is similar in international data—sometimes worse, sometimes not.
Over the longer run back to the 19th century, the issue of sample selection bias is more salient,
and the U.S. emerges as a more exceptional country. According to Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton
(2008), over the period 1900 to 2005, the real equity returns for the ”World ex-U.S.” have been 5.23%
(16 countries) compared to 6.52% in the U.S. alone. Only 3 out of the 16 other countries attained
higher average annual equity returns in this sample: South Africa, Australia, and Sweden. Zooming
in on turbulent periods like 1914 to 1945 also emphasizes the much greater volatility of equity
returns once the sample period extends outside the post-WW2 era. Converting these to excess
returns over bills, these authors found annualized equity risk premiums of 4.2% for the ”World
ex-U.S.” and 5.5% for the U.S. over the same period. Thus perhaps one quarter of the risk premium
puzzle might be explained away by sample selection bias when looking only at the U.S. data.

3.5.

The Evidence on the Housing Return Premium

Although housing constitutes a significant share of wealth, empirical work on the housing risk
premium has been held back by lack of widely available data on returns. Most references refer
to U.S. returns on residential and commercial real estate. Starting with the early studies for the
U.S. by Ibbotson and Siegel (1984), Case and Shiller (1989), and Goetzmann and Ibbotson (1990), a
common theme of this literature has been that the U.S. real estate market seems to offer attractive
risk-adjusted returns.
More precisely, diversified real estate investments have average returns that are only slightly
lower than common stocks, but much less volatile, so that real estate investments have much higher
Sharpe ratios. On the basis of the Case-Shiller housing return data, Goetzman (1993) discusses how
diversified real estate portfolios can help investors achieve superior risk-adjusted returns. Shilling
(2003) concluded that, since the 1980s, U.S. real estate investments carried a puzzlingly large risk
premium of about 6% annually, yet with only a fraction of the volatility of the stock market.
Real estate investments thus seem to offer very attractive risk-return trade-offs. As a result, many
have questioned whether the publicly available house price indices really capture the true volatility
of housing assets and to what extent the attractive risk-return characteristics of real estate hold up
to further scrutiny (Cheng, Liu, and Lin 2008). Moreover, from a household finance perspective, it
is the volatility of the individual house that matters, since households typically do not invest in a
diversified housing portfolio, but rather take on local idiosyncratic risk. Though tangential to the
representative agent approach to asset pricing, these issues may deserve more study.
For example, Flavin and Yamashita (2002), using PSID micro-level data from 1968 to 1992,
studied optimal portfolios including housing for mean-variance investors. In the data they found
annual real after-tax returns of 6.6% for housing and 8.2% for equities. Standard deviations were,
respectively, 14.2% and 24.2%. (Note that the after-tax basis of these returns depress them relative to

9

the pre-tax values we report in this paper.) Hence, their implied after-tax Sharpe ratios were about
0.3 for equities, but closer to 0.5 for housing in this sample; and their implied Hansen-Jagannathan
lower bound for the implied risk aversion parameter would therefore be about 1.6 times larger
for housing compared to equities. In addition, this study found housing returns to be negatively
correlated with all other asset classes, indicating substantial diversification benefits to a mixed
portfolio. However, studies such as Goetzmann (1993), Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider (2015), as
well as Eisfeldt and Demers (2015), find considerably lower city-wide house price volatilities in the
range of 7%–9%, depending on city, suggesting that self-assessed house prices in the PSID could
suffer from excessive high-frequency noise, leading to the volatility estimate being upward biased.
In our aggregate data, we will find analogous results, not just for a 25-year window of data for
the U.S., but for all advanced economies, and over long-run going back to 1870. Of course, macro
and micro data may deliver different results in reality as there is a significant asymmetry in practice
between equities, where the representative agent can hold the index, and housing, where such
diversification is not yet possible. The representative agent model used since Mehra and Prescott
(1985) ignores this constraint: in a no-trade equilibrium the agent buys and holds the market, the
full equity bundle and the full housing bundle. Yet, as Davis and Van Nieuwerburgh (2014) caution
that “the literature still misses high-quality data to pin down the return correlation matrix between
stocks, bonds, and individual houses”, so the study of individual-level housing investments is
painstakingly difficult. Nonetheless, even with our aggregate focus motivated by a literal and brute
application of the standard representative agent model, we shall discuss the sensitivity of our results
to micro-to-macro housing portfolio aggregation issues in the later part of this paper.

New Data on Housing and Equity Risk Premiums

In this section, we will discuss a major new source for the calculation of long-run returns and risk
premiums in 16 countries for 145 years, for four asset classes: equities, housing, bills and bonds.
This section draws on Jordà, Knoll, Kuvshinov, Schularick, and Taylor (forthcoming) [abbreviated
JKKST] which discusses the data sources and construction in great detail.
A major innovation in JKKST is the inclusion of housing returns. These new data on housing
returns cover capital gains, and also the net rents paid renters and owners (i.e., imputed). Equity
return data for publicly-traded equities will then be used, as is standard, as a proxy for aggregate
business equity returns.
The JKKST data include nominal and real returns on bills, bonds, equities, and residential real
estate for Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The
sample spans 1870 to 2015. Table 2 summarizes the data coverage by country and asset class.
Like most of the literature, JKKST examine returns to national aggregate holdings of each asset
class. Theoretically, as in the benchmark asset pricing models in this paper, these are the returns
that accrue for the hypothetical representative-agent investor holding each country’s portfolio.

Bill returns In JKKST, the canonical risk-free rate is taken to be the yield on Treasury bills, i.e.,
short-term, fixed-income government securities, typically 3-month maturity. The yield data come
from the latest vintage of the long-run macrohistory database (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2016).3
Whenever data on Treasury bill returns were unavailable, JKKST relied on either money market
rates or deposit rates of banks from Zimmermann (2017). Since short-term government debt was
rarely used and issued in the earlier historical period, much of the bill rate data before the 1960s
actually consist of deposit rates.

Bond returns In JKKST, these are conventionally the total return on long-term government bonds.
Unlike earlier cross-country studies, JKKST focus on the bonds listed and traded on local exchanges
and denominated in local currency. This focus makes bond returns more comparable with the
returns of bills, equities, and housing. Moreover, this results in a larger sample of bonds, and on
bonds that are more likely to be held by the representative household in the respective country.
For some countries and periods JKKST have made use of listings on major global exchanges to fill
gaps where domestic markets were thin, or local exchange data were not available (for example,
Australian bonds listed in New York or London). Throughout the sample JKKST target a maturity
of around 10 years.
3 The

data are online at www.macrohistory.net/data .

11

Equity returns In JKKST, these returns come from a broad range of sources, including articles
in economic and financial history journals, yearbooks of statistical offices and central banks, stock
exchange listings, newspapers, and company reports. Throughout most of the sample, JKKST
rely on indices weighted by market capitalization of individual stocks, and a stock selection
that is representative of the entire stock market. For some historical time periods in individual
countries, however, JKKST also make use of indices weighted by company book capital, stock market
transactions, or weighted equally, due to limited data availability.

Housing returns In JKKST, these data combine the long-run house price series introduced by
Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) with a novel dataset on rents drawn from the unpublished PhD
thesis of Knoll (2017). For most countries, the rent series rely on the rent components of the cost
of living of consumer price indices constructed by national statistical offices. JKKST then combine
them with information from other sources to create long-run series reaching back to the late 19th
century. To proxy the total return on the residential housing stock, the returns include both rented
housing and owner-occupied properties. These series also include an adjustment for maintenance
and depreciation. To the best of our knowledge, JKKST are the first to calculate housing returns in
the literature for as long and comprehensive a cross section of economies.

A Bigger Puzzle: Returns on Equities and Housing

The consumption-based asset pricing model is disarmingly simple. In equilibrium, the returns of
an asset, any asset, should reflect how we value consumption today against that in the uncertain
future, and the insurance the asset provides against bad consumption states. In aggregate, little else
matters. Realistic frictions faced by individual investors play a secondary role in the aggregate. The
quantitative assessment of this model to date has relied primarily on easily available data on equity
returns, with a focus on the U.S. postwar experience. The equity-premium puzzle documented by
Mehra and Prescott (1985) highlighted how implausibly high the implied price of risk seems to be.
Tables 3 and 4 provide a bird’s eye view of the new total return data. As discussed in Section 2,
equity returns are capital gains adjusted with dividends, and reported in real raw terms deflated
by CPI inflation. Similarly, housing returns are capital gains adjusted with unique data on rents
from Knoll (2017), and also reported in real raw terms and net of maintenance and depreciation.
The tables calculate real and excess returns for equities, housing and the 50-50 portfolio alongside
the return on two “safe assets” short- and long-term government securities, usually 3-months and
10-years in duration respectively, where we label these “bills” and “bonds,” respectively.
We report our results here, and in subsequent tables, using two samples. A pooled unbalanced
panel of all available cross-country data from 1870 to 2015 (but excluding a window of 2 years
around both world wars), and a balanced panel based on a post-WW2 subsample that begins in
1963 and ends in 2015.

in our sample provided in Appendix table A.2. The moments are computed for raw returns, and the units are
percent. See text.

Table 3 (and individually for each country in Table A.1) shows that real total returns on safe
assets hover in the 1%–2% range across countries in the full sample. For the U.S., bills and bonds
returned 1.5% and 2.0%, respectively, about the same as the average for the World (here, “World”
refers to the average for the 16 advanced economies in our sample). These returns are about
the same in the post-WW2 sample, being higher in the 1970s and 1980s, before falling with the
well-documented secular decline in safe rates observed internationally over the past 30 or so years

13

(see, e.g., Holston, Laubach and Williams 2017). Cross-country variation is rather limited in both
samples, regardless of whether one examines bills or bonds.
Equity and housing returns are similar across countries. In the World samples, returns are about
7% although equities are 2 to 3 times as volatile (measured by their standard deviation) as housing.
For the U.S., housing returns are about 6% compared with about 7% for equities in the post-WW2
era, and yet they are about one-quarter as volatile (3.5% versus 16%). Not surprisingly, when we
look at excess returns reported in Table 4 (and for individual countries in Table A.2), we find that
these are sizable—around 6% on average for the World when using bills as the safe asset, and about
1 percentage point lower when using bonds as the safe asset. The U.S. displays a higher equity risk
premium and lower housing risk premium in the full sample, but is well within the global range of
variation shown.

5.1.

Sharpe Ratios and Hansen-Jagannathan Bounds

The ratio of the mean of the excess return to its standard deviation is known as the Sharpe ratio,
and it provides a good summary statistic of the basic risk-return trade-offs of an investment. In
simple settings—e.g., the mean-variance optimizing investor—the higher this ratio, the higher the
returns for a given level of risk, and the more desirable the investment is, all else equal.
Of course, what is meant by “risk” in calculating the Sharpe ratio can be an imperfect guide.
Investors that favor stability in their consumption streams—that is, risk-averse investors—will favor
investments that insure them against bad consumption states. Thus, the volatility of the investment
is as important as how the returns on the investment covary with consumption growth. As we
discuss in a moment, an investment with higher pay-offs in a downturn should perhaps command a
higher premium than an investment that fares poorly in recession.
The Hansen-Jagannathan lower bound (Hansen and Jagannathan 1991) combines these two
concepts of risk into a measure that sets a floor to the volatility of the pricing kernel. Remember
that the pricing kernel reflects the utility trade-offs between consuming today versus consuming
tomorrow given that the future is uncertain and given that consumers dislike uncertainty. (In our
baseline setting the pricing kernel is derived from power utility, as seen below.)
Information on Sharpe ratios and consumption growth volatility are provided in Table 5 for both
of the samples (Full versus Post-WW2) that we have been considering (expanded per country results
appear in Table A.3). Several results deserve comment. In line with the results reported earlier,
housing offers considerably better investment opportunities than equities as measured by the Sharpe
ratio. In some countries and depending on the sample, the Sharpe ratio rises above the fabled
threshold of 1. More generally, averaging across the countries in our sample, the Sharpe is about
two to three times larger for housing than it is for equities. Given σ( g), the Hansen-Jagannathan
lower bound will also then be twice as large too. The housing puzzle starts to loom larger.
Absent additional information, these returns seem wildly out of proportion compared to the
volatility of consumption. After all, if the premiums demanded by consumers on risky investments

reflect—at least in part—distaste for volatility in consumption over time, it must be because
consumption itself is volatile. That is clearly not the case. The volatility of consumption for any
country, regardless of sample, is an order of magnitude smaller than one would expect.
One possibility not accounted for in Table 5 is that risky returns could be highly correlated
with consumption growth. Or, how else would we explain such high excess returns? The less an
investment insures against fluctuations in consumption the higher a premium a consumer would
require as compensation for holding such an investment. Table 6 (and Table A.4 in the Appendix)
therefore calculates the correlation between returns and consumption growth.
In the U.S., where a great deal of the literature has focused, the correlation between equities and
consumption growth is 0.47 (0.60 postwar). This number holds promise but appears to be on the
high side when looked at in a comparative international context. The pooled average correlation
between equity returns and consumption growth across countries in our sample is less than half
that of the U.S., at around 0.11 (0.26 postwar). However, a new wrinkle appears when we look at

15

housing returns. In the U.S., housing returns, in addition to having a lower volatility than equities,
also have much lower annual correlation with consumption growth than equities (about 0.4 versus
0.6). Again, the correlation is lower still around the world (just 0.13 full sample). Indeed, the Table
A.4 shows that no other risky return in any country is as highly correlated with that country’s
consumption growth as it is for U.S. equity. Rather than abating, the puzzle grows.

5.2.

Consumption Betas and Implied Risk Aversion

The analysis thus far has described basic properties of the returns on equities and housing with
scant reference to the statistical properties of consumption growth and the economic implications of
their interaction. It is time to extend the analysis in this direction. We explore two distinct but closely
related summary calculations based on the consumption-capital asset pricing model (C-CAPM).
If one is willing to make the further assumption that the investor’s preferences are well captured
by the ubiquitous power utility function, Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989) show that the
average gross excess real returns of an asset can be expressed in terms of the (constant) coefficient of
relative risk aversion, γ, and the gross growth rate of real consumption per capita between periods t
and t + h and denoted gc,t+h ,
E[ Ri,t+h − R f ,t+h ] = λh β i,h ,
with
λh =

γ Var( gc,t+h )
;
1 − γE( gc,t+h − 1)

β i,h =

Cov( gc,t+h , Ri,t+h − R f ,t+h )
.
Var( gc,t+h )

(3)

(4)

Here λh is the strictly positive market price of consumption risk. Similarly, β i,h > 0 for most assets.
The expressions (3) and (4) require linear approximation assumptions, assumptions about the
utility function underlying the investor’s preferences, and an assumption that the risk aversion
parameter remain constant over time.
Estimating λ j would require further assumptions, but the parameter β i,h can be calculated
directly from the data for various horizons h. Based on this approach, Table 7 reports estimates of
β i,1 for i = E, H, T, and Figure 2 displays estimates of β i,h for h = 1, . . . , 5 for the same three possible
investments.
Finally, under lognormal return assumptions and with approximations, an estimate of the
coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA) can be easily calculated as:
RRA ≡ γ =

ln E( Ri,t+h ) − ln E( R f ,t+h )
Cov(ln Ri,t+h , ln gc,t+h )

(5)

Table 8 reports such an estimate for h = 1 and for each of the three investments considered
i = E, H, T. Meanwhile, Figure 3 shows the estimates of γ using h = 1, . . . , 5.
Turning to first to the consumption beta estimates, consider the values of β i,h based on expression
(4) first, as reported in Table 7 and Figure 2b. Perhaps the most useful comparison is of β E,h and
β H,h . Recall that the model implies β i,h > 0 but otherwise, there is little guidance on interpreting

16

the specific values that this parameter may take for a given asset, but a helpful metric is to compare
the equity β against the housing β. Table 7 reports the results for h = 1. Nearly uniformly across
samples (full and post-WW2 samples) and across countries (see Table A.5 in the Appendix), it is
almost always the case that β E,h > β H,h . For the U.S., the implied beta for equities is 5 to 10 times
that for housing; in the World samples it is 2 to 3 times.
Turning to Figure 2b, which focuses on the post-WW2 sample only, we display the values of β i,h
for the U.S. in panel (a) and World in panel (b). The figure suggests that differences in the betas are
largest for h = 1 and somewhat dissipate as h increases (although a more sizable gap remains for the
U.S. as shown in panel (a)). The figure also shows that the differences between equity and housing
betas are more extreme in the U.S. than in the World sample at all horizons shown. These results
confirm much of what we found in previous sections, namely, that the standard consumption-based
asset price model has greater difficulty in explaining the observed historical returns to housing,
even more than was the case for equities.
We end this section by returning to the calculations of the implied coefficient of relative risk
aversion implied by power utility. The objective is less to come with a precise estimate and more
to show that conventional estimates are off by almost an order of magnitude for equities and even
more so for housing. Begin with Table 8. The estimated γ based on expression (5) is between 18
and 40 for the U.S. and for equities (comparing full versus post-WW2 samples) but shoots up to
between 48 to 203 for housing. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon. The same figures for the World
sample are pretty stable over time, hovering around 40–50 for equities and 80–100 for housing in
both samples. For the total portfolios the implied World coefficient of relative risk aversion is 60 in
both samples, about halfway between the implied equity and housing coefficients.
The picture improves a little bit when considering estimates of γ over extended horizons, as
displayed in Figure 3. This figure only shows the post-WW2 balanced sample results over a
maximum horizon of 5 years. Panel (a) corresponds to the U.S. and shows that the γ for equities
fluctuates in the range 40–60, similar to the numbers reported in Table 8. The housing γ becomes
more muted over time as it declines from about 200 at the 1-year horizon to a low of about 100,
although it is still far above the benchmark value of 10 or lower, the high end of what is considered
to be a plausible value of the risk aversion parameter.
Panel (b) corresponds to the World pooled sample. Here too, we see a similar temporal pattern
where the housing γ declines quickly beyond the 1-year horizon and in fact quickly becomes very
similar to that for equities, both fluctuating in value at around 40. That said, these values are again
still much too high relative to the benchmark level of 10.
Finally, note that the low correlation of equity and housing returns means that the puzzle
remains serious even when we look at the 50-50 total wealth portfolio. In panel (a), for the U.S.
post-WW2 balanced sample, the implied coefficient of relative risk aversion varies between about 50
and 75 at all horizons, and comes in at an average of about 65. In panel (b), for the World post-WW2
balanced sample, the implied coefficient of relative risk aversion varies between 30 and 60 at all
horizons, and comes in at an average of about 50.

The Total Risk Premium Puzzle

A concise way to summarize what we have learned in this section is presented in Table 9. This table
reports the annual correlation of equity, housing and the 50-50 portfolio with consumption growth
in the left hand block of columns, both for the U.S. and for the 17-country world average, calculated
as in Table 6. We report these results for both the full and the post-WW2 samples that we have
considered throughout. The right-hand side block of columns report the model-implied estimates of
the γ coefficient of relative risk aversion calculated as in Table 8. The correlation of returns with
consumption growth is similar across categories yet the differences in the risk aversion parameter
are vast.
This potentially opens new doors for macro-finance research. Moving from equity to the full
wealth portfolio of the representative agent aggravates the challenges of the model to match the
data. In the context of the canonical representative-agent asset pricing model, we cannot speak of
just an equity risk premium puzzle any more. We are also confronted with a housing risk premium
puzzle and a total risk premium puzzle.

5.4.

Further Checks and Adjustments

Before we infer that the inclusion of housing in consumption-based asset pricing aggravates the
problems of the canonical model, it is important to think about a number of objections that have
been raised with regard to the standard model. Specifically, as noted in the introduction, for ceteris
paribus reasons we have strictly adhered to the logic of the representative agent model and its
no-trade equilibrium. But some deviations from that setup might be particularly salient in the case
of housing, so we need to consider how they might affect our core results presented above.
Three issues stand out, and we will discuss them here as they are potentially important when it
comes to housing returns: limited participation, transaction costs, idiosyncratic risks, and liquidity.

20

Do any of these adjustment have the potential to overturn our key finding that the puzzles of the
consumption based asset price model get worse when one includes housing into the total wealth
portfolio? We will argue that the answer is likely negative.

5.4.1

Limited Participation

We start with limited participation as a potential reason for the observed failure of the standard
consumption based model. With respect to equity returns, papers such as Mankiw and Zeldes (1991)
and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) argue that the consumption stream of stockholders is more volatile
and more highly correlated with excess returns to equities. In Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy
(2002), as the participation threshold is raised (based on value of assets owned), the correlation
of the per capita consumption growth with the equity premium rises, and so again the implied
RRA parameter falls. Hence, the RRA parameter implied by the consumption of luxury goods falls
relative to national accounts data. Aı̈t-Sahalia, Parker, and Yogo (2004) find a similar result when
the consumption stream is restricted to a set luxury goods which form a more significant share of
rich households’ spending.4
However, limited participation arguments are much less likely to work in the context of housing
as compared to equities. And the reason is simple: housing is a much more broadly held asset
than equities. According to Mankiw and Zeldes (1991) only 25% of U.S. households own stock. In
contrast, U.S. Census Bureau data shows that for more than 50 years, going back to 1962, the U.S.
home ownership rate (share owner-occupied) has been between 63% and 69% in all years. Only in
the uppermost deciles do equities start to take up a large fraction of household portfolios. Thus,
while limited participation is a serious problem for equities, and could strongly bias the results
of consumption-based capital asset pricing models applied to aggregate data, the bias should be
significantly smaller in the case of housing, since a much larger fraction of households own a house.
A graphical view of the long-run cross-section patterns in U.S. real estate and equity holdings
by households can be gleaned from Survey of Consumer Finances, using newly collected data by
Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins (2017). Some representative snapshots for the 1960s, 1980s, and today
are shown in Figure 4, and these clearly makes the point that exposure to housing investment risk
runs very far down the wealth distribution, but material exposure to equity investment risk is only
a matter for the top quintile. For confirmation using a different source, PSID data by wealth decile,
Barras and Betermier (2016) have shown similar patterns in today’s data.
4 The

point may well apply more broadly. An alternative disaggregated approach would be to look at other
less aggregate consumption streams, which can be more volatile than the averaged national accounts data
would suggest. E.g., Attanasio and Weber (1993) and Beaudry and van Wincoop (1996) have found higher
values for the IES (or lower RRA) using disaggregated cohort-level and state-level consumption data.

5.4.2

Transaction Costs

Transaction costs for assets might potentially explain the problems of the consumption-based asset
pricing model. Moreover, such concerns might loom especially large in the case of housing. So far
the results seem mixed, in that plain symmetric transaction costs can do very little to help bring
down the implausibly high values of the implied RRA, or its Hansen-Jagannathan lower bound
(He and Modest 1995; Luttmer 1996). Instead, more complicated transaction costs, specifically on
short-sales might be required to make any difference to the puzzle.
In Table 10 and what follows we explore whether this approach could have promise if applied to
housing premium puzzle. We argue that it likely does not. For the equity market, typical transaction
costs values used applied to the U.S. are 1.5 bps and 75 bps for the Treasury bill and value-weighted
equity returns, respectively. The 75 bps value may be a little low for the equity market over the
longer run, as costs have fallen in recent decades on U.S. bourses. Jones (2002) finds a round-trip
transaction cost of 100 bps. For less frequently traded stocks spreads could be as high or higher
(and likewise, of course, for nontraded equity), and they could well be higher in overseas markets
and in more distant historical epochs.
However, these simple cost ratios need to be adjusted for the typical trading frequency of
each asset. Jones (2002) also shows that equity market turnover, at least post-WW2, has been at a
minimum of 25% annually on the NYSE, rising rapidly in recent years. Over a longer horizon NYSE
turnover has been at least 50% on average implying annualized round-trip transaction costs of at
least 50 bps (100 bps times 50%) over a century or so.

Notes: This table shows transaction cost computations for U.S. equities and housing as detailed in the text.

One’s first thought might be that in the context of our risk premium puzzle applied to housing,
the transaction costs explanation might bear more fruit. After all, on any individual transaction the
costs are much higher for the trade of a house, than for an equity trade. For example, in the U.S.
standard realtor fees are typically 600 bps and an additional 100 bps might be absorbed by other
fees such as title, recording, and closing costs, for a total round-trip transaction cost of 700 bps.
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out the analogous calculations of transaction costs for U.S. housing
generate a not so different result. A recent study by Bachmann and Cooper (2014) finds that annual
turnover in the housing market is 15%, using PSID data (see their Figure 2). That is, the typical
house is bought and sold roughly once every 7 years. Given the round-trip transaction cost of 700
bps for housing, this works out to annual round-trip transaction costs of 105 bps for this asset class
too, only about 50 bps higher than equities. Thus, prima facie, it would seem that using transaction
costs to provide an explanation of the housing premium puzzle will be about as successful, or
unsuccessful, as using transaction costs to provide an explanation of the equity premium puzzle.
That is, not very.
As a final caveat, we could worry that it is possibly misleading to base this argument entirely on
moments computed from short holding periods, such as annual data, when most houses are not
being traded, but equities are. However, this is where our decision to explore the puzzle at longer
horizons provides extra assurances. We showed about that at horizons all the way out to h = 5 years,
the puzzles remain intact, and the implied RRAs remain ludicrously large. As we extend to ever
longer holding periods, the differences in transaction frequency, possibly due to different liquidity
and other characteristics of the two assets, will matter much less, but as we have seen earlier the
puzzle still remains strong at longer horizons.

5.4.3

Idiosyncratic Risks

Idiosyncratic risks could be especially salient for the housing component of wealth. It is, of course,
relatively easy for a U.S. investor to “hold the market” by investing in a low-cost mutual fund or
ETF which tracks the total return to a broad stock index like the S&P500. (Of course, this argument
does not apply to the large share of enterprise wealth that is not publicly traded as shares on stock
markets, and which is often held in concentrated forms, e.g., family businesses.)

data are sourced from the OFHEO index. Zillow data are sourced from the Zillow Home Value Index which
covers around 95% of the US housing stock, and are averages of monthly values. National data are the returns
and volatility of prices for a nationwide housing, and the other figures cover a representative state, county or
zipcode level porftolio respectively. See Jordà, Knoll, Kuvshinov, Schularick, and Taylor (forthcoming)

Having said that, it is even more difficult, nay, impossible, for a U.S. investor to buy an index
that tracks the total return to aggregate U.S. housing. Rather, if we are a typical homeowner, we
own our own house, and that house alone. It will suffer regional, state, county, and possibly also
city and neighborhood risks which are not present in the national house price index.
The question is, are these disaggregated local housing risks large enough to matter, relative
to the national, to change the picture substantially? We argue that although they go in the right
direction, these adjustments are unlikely to solve the problem entirely, simply because we find the
housing premium puzzle is so big in our data.
Drawing on Jordà, Knoll, Kuvshinov, Schularick, and Taylor (forthcoming), Table 11 compares
the recent level and volatility of the US conforming mortgage based OFHEO national house price
indices with those that cover sub-national markets, where the latter are sourced from Zillow.
Comparing columns 2 and 3 of Table 11, the nationwide moments of the data are similar across
the two measures—but, as expected, the OFHEO data display slightly higher real capital gains and
slightly lower volatility, because they have a less comprehensive coverage of the areas that were hit
hardest by the subprime crisis, which receives a relatively high weight in the 1995–2015 US sample
used here. Columns 3–5 of Table 11 also show that the volatility of the housing series increases
as we move from the aggregate portfolio (column 2) to the subnational and local level. But not
by much. Any individual house will track Zillow Zipcode-level price movements closely, and the
standard deviation of those housing returns is roughly one-third (a factor 4/3) higher than that in
the national data, so the Sharpe Ratio and related puzzles revealed by the moments our housing
return data might be mitigated by 25% (i.e., by a factor of 3/4).
This pattern is consistent with a very long tradition of work. In a seminal paper, Case and
Shiller (1988) documented that prices of individual homes are twice as volatile as city-level house
price indexes. Similar patterns appear in Flavin and Yamashita (2002) and Piazzesi et al. (2007).
Flavin and Yamashita (2002) looked at individual-level PSID data from 1968 to 1992 they found the
annual standard deviation of housing returns to be 14%, versus 24% for stocks. This compared with
Case-Shiller city wide annual standard deviation of housing returns of 7%. In that same period the

24

FHFA U.S. price index has standard deviation of about 3.3%. However, as noted earlier, one concern
might be the potential excess volatility of self-reported PSID housing wealth data.
In addition, as noted in a recent work by Giacoletti (2016), all these works except the first,
assumed price shocks were i.i.d., but Case and Shiller (1987) and Goetzmann (1993) show that at
short horizons the volatility does not scale to zero, indicating that care must be taken with regard
to the holding period being studied. Giacoletti (2016) looks across horizons and, using CoreLogic
data, focuses narrowly on a few real estate markets with big price action (LA, San Francisco, San
Diego). He shows that the fraction of individual house price volatility determined by idiosyncratic
risk is decreasing as the holding period increases. Idiosyncratic risk makes up to 60% of capital
gains volatility of home resales after one year, but it accounts for less than 20% after five years.
Therefore, a putative resolution of the housing puzzle via this mechanism appears incomplete; it
might only be promising at short horizons, and unlikely to change the story at long horizons where
the puzzle remains strong. It is again fortunate that we have computed values of the implied RRA,
or its Hansen-Jagannathan lower bound at a range of horizons. Once we get out to five years, the
housing puzzle still remains large, but the idiosyncratic volatility is less that 20%, and this would be
too small of an amplification to materially change the key asset pricing moments, as it would not do
much to raise the consumption beta or depress the implied RRA for housing. Even at the one year
horizon, a 75% increase in housing price volatility would leave the implied RRAs in Table 8 still at a
level of about 40 or higher—still much higher than the equity-implied RRAs, and well above the a
priori reasonable range.

5.4.4

Liquidity

From the point of view of an individual investor, real estate is a heterogenous asset held over over
relative long periods of time that is usually traded in decentralized markets far more infrequently
than equities, as we just showed. Uncertainty on how much time the seller will need to close the
transaction is considered an important reason why real estate returns carry a liquidity premium.
When prices are rising, selling times are short and the volume of transactions are high. When prices
are falling, all these features go into reverse.
It has been long recognized that for an individual investor, housing must carry a liquidity
premium. Theoretical asset pricing models on housing have incorporated this and other features
of housing markets (see, e.g. Krainer 2001; Piazessi and Schneider 2009; Ngai and Tenreyro 2014).
However, empirical estimates of the magnitude of this liquidity premium are hard to come by.
One notable exception is Lin and Vandell (2007), who introduce a model of the liquidity premium
and estimates based on U.S. data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise (OFHEO) from
1981Q1 to 2004Q4. Table 2 of their paper in particular, reports a calculation informative for our
purposes. The table is organized as a function of the expected time the house will be in the market
before it is sold, and adjusted for the holding period.

25

For example, data from the National Association of Realtors in the U.S.5 reports that recently
sold homes were on the market a median of 4 weeks (one month). Using those figures, Lin and
Vandell (2007) indicate the variance would need to be scaled by a factor of 1.02 based on a holding
period of 10 years. Holding periods in the U.S. appear to be in line with those in other countries.
Data from various sources6 indicate holding periods in 2015 were 10 years in Australia, 9 years
in New Zealand (not in our dataset), 9 years in Canada, and 11 years in the U.K., all very close
to the U.S. median. Prior to the Great Recession, the median tenure in the U.S. had been in the
neighborhood of 6 to 7 years historically, bringing the scaling factor closer to 1.05. These numbers
increase to 1.10 and 1.19 respectively if we quadruple to 4 months the time it takes to sell a house.
Even under these adverse scenarios, the increase in the variance of housing returns suggested by
these scaling factors would fall well short to explain the housing premium that we report above.
An alternative options-based framework for gauging liquidity premia is provided by Longstaff
(2018). Here, illiquidity takes the form of a lockup or “gate” which prevents sale in a given window.
Theoretically, the upper bound on the opportunity cost of not being able to trade is equal to forgoing
an option to sell at the asset’s expected high price in the window, the best-case scenario. The value
of selling at this optimal stopping time equals the value of a put option at the exercise date with
a strike equal to the expected high, which has a closed-form solution. Using, Table 2 of Longstaff
(2018), for an asset with 10% annualized volatility and a holding period of 10 years (comparable
moments to housing found in our data) the required liquidity premium is 126 basis point or 1.25
ppt. Since the excess return to housing is about 6 ppt this correction amounts to a downscaling of
the risk premium of only 125/600 or about 20%. Since the Sharpe ratio of housing is double that of
equities, and since this is very much an upper bound, this correction also does little to explain away
the even larger risk premium puzzle we have uncovered for housing as compared to equities.

6.

“Exotic” Models and the Total Risk Premium Puzzle

In this section we study how more “exotic” variants of the benchmark consumption-based asset
pricing model cope with the addition of housing to the aggregate portfolio. More precisely, we ask
to what extent well-known extensions of the standard model can resolve the total risk premium
puzzle that we discussed in the previous sections. The literature is vast, and here we focus on two
important approaches, both of which respond to the fundamental problem that in the benchmark
model the stochastic discount factor derived from the second moment of the consumption claim has
very low volatility compared to the asset price volatility which it is supposed to explain.
The first approach is to expand the sample, dispense with lognormal assumptions, and admit
“rare disaster” events: unusually low consumption values mostly associated with wars or major
financial crises. Their inclusion increases both the volatility and negative skewness in the consump5 2016

tion growth process, making the asset less attractive, i.e., boosting the risk premium. An asset that
loses its value in disasters provides poor insurance and an investor may therefore demand a high
risk premium on such an asset. This is the argument developed by Rietz (1988) and advanced further
by Barro (2006) and subsequent papers, to explain why there is a large equity premium. A key idea
is that the sample sizes used in much previous research may have been too short (or too focused on
the U.S.) to include any or many such rarely observed disasters, where consumption declines by
dramatic amounts. In related research, Muir (2017) expands on this idea, using historical data similar
to ours, and finds risk premium spikes in disasters: that is, asset prices fall by significantly more
than dividends. But while this is true in financial crises, it is not very evident in deep recessions or
even wars—suggesting still another conundrum for the traditional consumption based asset pricing
model even allowing for a disaster-based approach.
The other major approach, instead of boosting the volatility of the claim, changes the underlying
utility functions of agents to amplify the volatility of the model’s stochastic discount factor. The two
influential examples we consider are the habits model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and the
long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004). In the habits model, preferences are such that the
relevant consumption level is not absolute, but the level relative to some inherited habitual baseline
that originates from the agent’s past history; by construction, volatility around this sluggishlymoving level is far more pronounced when consumption is persistent and the habitual baseline lags
behind actual consumption. Thus, the stochastic discount factor gets more variable.
In the long-run risks model, preferences are such that utility derives not just from today’s
consumption but also from a recursive term incorporating future expectations. Where habits add a
backward-looking term, this model adds a forward-looking term, but it serves a similar purpose
here when combined with a volatile long-run growth. If utility puts weight on this recursive term,
small changes in the agent’s expectations of long-run growth can deliver large changes in utility, and
hence in the stochastic discount factor. As with rare disasters, this model makes the consumption
path change, but it does this via a small growth rate change along the entire future path, rather than
a large front-loaded drop in levels, and recursion then makes the change bite on asset prices today.
Looking at rare disasters, habits, and long-run risk approaches, we now ask how these models
stand up to inclusion of housing into the asset portfolio. How successful are such extensions in
explaining the total risk premium puzzle? To address this question we now augment and refine
some of the models, implement them with two risky assets, rather than just one, and discuss the
details of how we implement these extensions.
Still, when all is said and done, the bottom line is not that surprising. Although all of these
approaches have been shown to make some progress in addressing the equity risk premium puzzle,
they are, like the benchmark model, faced with a much harder challenge when seeking to explain
the housing risk premium puzzle and the total risk premium puzzle. For these latter two puzzles,
as we have seen, the risk premium is just as high as in the case of equities, but the key correlation
between the asset return and the consumption process is even lower. In most models, this also leads
to an even bigger problem to match model to data with “reasonable” parameters.

27

6.1.

Barro (2006) with Risky Assets

A series of influential papers building on Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006) attributes the risk premium
on equity to the existence of rare disasters. Infrequent but severe disasters, such as World Wars,
the Great Depression and major financial crises, generate dramatic contractions in output and
consumption, which in conjunction with diminishing marginal utilities imply large risk premiums
despite their infrequent nature. The rarity of disasters, of course, implies a “peso problem”: as Barro
(2006) notes, the mere potential for disasters has major effects on required rates of returns despite
prolonged stability in most Western countries during the second half of the 20th century.
In the spirit of the Barro (2006) rare disasters model, we augment the model to incorporate
two risky assets and investigate whether the distinct behavior of equity and housing claims during
consumption disasters can work in this framework to explain the total risk premium puzzle. In a
nutshell, we show empirically that rare disasters trigger larger risk premiums for equity claims, but
not housing claims. Rare disasters hence cannot resolve the issue of of similar observed equity and
housing returns and risk premiums given the much more severe equity price declines seen during
consumption disasters.
One contribution vis-à-vis the standard Barro (2006) model relates to deriving a closed form
solution for the expected risky return of any arbitrary asset.7 Full details are given in the Appendix
and in Barro (2006) for the initial setup, yet we briefly highlight our procedure. In essence, we
assume that the dividend stream follows a similar exogenous process as the consumption process,
i.e., it is characterized by uncertainty during normal times as well as rare disasters which unfold over
one period. We allow for co-movement during calm periods by introducing a joint normal process for
regular fluctuations. With respect to disaster periods, we impose simultaneity among consumption
and assets disasters. As such, we restrict attention to dividend declines during consumption disaster
periods and not vice versa. We believe this assumption is justified given that the risk premium
crucially depends on high marginal utilities during consumption disasters. In our setting, assets are
by construction only imperfectly correlated with consumption. As such, required risk premiums for
assets are lower than the risk premium on the consumption claim itself.
We present the results of our exercise in Table 12. The risk premium for the consumption claim
equals 4.7% and is about 1.1% higher than the risk premium in Barro (2006) for output claims.
Most of the gap can be attributed to a higher disaster probability of 2.1% versus 1.7% (in our data)
for consumption versus output disasters. More importantly though, the model clearly predicts
lower risk premiums for housing returns. The associated premium equals 0.5% while the risk
premium for equity returns amounts to 2.9%. The gap is substantial and partially due to a higher
correlation between equity and consumption claims during normal times. However, the majority
of this difference can be attributed to the behavior during consumption disasters simply because
7 Barro

and Ursúa (2008) extend the CRRA framework and introduce Epstein-Zin preferences. Epstein-Zin
preferences do not affect the risk premium per se, but mitigate some counterfactual asset pricing implications.
Since we focus on differences in risk premiums among equity and housing claims in the presence of rare
disasters, we review the CRRA case which we also impose in the main body of this paper.

Notes: This table shows the extended Barro (2006) model with risky assets applied to our data. The first
column reproduces the Barro (2006) estimates and calibration for comparison. The remaining columns are
based on our data. Y=Output, C=Consumption, E=Equity, H=Housing. Consumption disaster definitions are
based on Barro and Ursúa (2008) and include peak to trough declines of at least 10%. Barro (2006) defines a
threshold of 15% which he subsequently revised to 10% in follow-up papers. The partial default rate for the
”risk-free” asset is set to zero to more closely align with observed returns.

owning houses seem to be a superior hedge—that is, during the rare disasters, drops in prices in
the housing market are statistically less associated with (utility weighted) consumption declines
than equity. We shall expand on this point when we turn to our application of the Muir (2017)
methodology below.

6.2.

Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013) with Risky Assets

We just highlighted that the Barro (2006) rare disasters model is unable to explain the total risk
premium puzzle of roughly equal housing and equity returns. Yet as Gourio (2008) and Constantinides (2008) among others argue, the Barro (2006) model features two assumptions that are not
supported by data and could potentially undermine any conclusions, namely instant disasters and
irreversibility. Intuitively, fast recoveries reduce the persistence of disasters on dividend streams and
therefore reduce the drop in prices when disasters occur. Multi-period disasters, everything else
equal, make disasters less risky.

29

In subsequent influential work, Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013) addressed this
critique and consequently adjust the rare disaster model of Barro (2006), again focusing only on
the consumption claim. They find strong support for partial recoveries and disasters that last for
multiple periods. Their associated (consumption claim) risk premium therefore ranks in between
the Barro (2006) model and the plain vanilla asset pricing model of Mehra and Prescott (1985).
Before diving into details about why we think including partial recoveries and multi-period
disasters makes the total risk premium puzzle more puzzling, it is worth stressing the conditions
under which the new features may help to bridge the gap in risk premiums and hence resolve the
puzzle proposed in this paper. First, equity disasters may unfold over a considerably longer stretch
of time and losses could hence be distributed over multiple periods. Second, despite the severity
of peak to trough equity declines, stock markets might recover more substantially than housing
markets, thereby reducing the persistence of equity disasters.
In the remainder of this section, we provide evidence against these possibilities and conclude
that the total risk premium puzzle gets worse when the model expands to include recoveries and
multi-period disasters. Our strategy, following Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013), is to
develop a method to re-estimate the model for equity and housing claims. We then show that shortrun per period declines are stronger and recoveries weaker for equity compared to housing claims.
We further highlight that housing and not equity disasters unfold over a longer period of time.
Last but not least we provide evidence of a positive co-movement between disaster probabilities
for equity and consumption claims if a country finds itself in a consumption disaster, but we find
no such pattern for housing claims. The latter breaks the link between a high marginal utility of
consumption during consumption disasters and housing price drops, which in turn ultimately and
counter-factually implies a much lower risk premium for housing.
We briefly highlight the empirical model and focus on three parameters of interest: the temporary
drop and permanent decline in assets or consumption due to a disaster, as well as the persistence
of disasters. The model itself is estimated using Bayesian MCMC methods. We use the same prior
calibration as in Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013) and refer to their paper for full
details. In particular, the prior on the long-run impact of disasters is uninformative in the sense
that we are agnostic about whether disasters have any long-run effect at all and allow for positive
long-run effects.
Formally, we denote log dividends or consumption di,j,t , in country i in year t, where the claim
type is j ∈ {Consumption, Equity, Housing}. These are modeled as the sum of three unobserved
components: Potential ”output” (xi,j,t ), a disaster gap (zi,j,t ) and an i.i.d. distributed normal shock
(ei,j,t ). Equations (7) and (8) highlight the evolution of potential consumption and the disaster gap.
di,j,t = xi,j,t + zi,j,t + ei,j,t ,

4 xi,j,t = µi,j,t + θi,j,t Ii,j,t + ηi,j,t ,
zi,j,t = ρ j zi,j,t−1 − θi,j,t Ii,j,t + φi,j,t Ii,j,t + νi,j,t .

Notes: This table shows the NSBU and Extended NSBU model parameters. Estimates are posterior means. In
line with Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013), we assume that disaster parameters are common
across countries and time. The first column refers to the original estimates in Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro,
and Ursúa (2013) for comparison, and the remaining columns to results based on our data. C=Consumption,
H=Housing, E=Equity. The estimates are based on 40 runs with 50,000 iterations each.

The disaster gap follows an AR(1) structure with persistence given by ρ j , while potential consumption
follows a random walk with drift. The terms νi,j,t and ηi,j,t are i.i.d. shocks similar to ei,j,t , and µi,j,t is
the country-specific average growth rate. The term Ii,j,t is a Bernoulli random variable and indicates
disaster periods. The occurrence of disasters itself follows a Markov process. It is characterized by
an exit probability in each period (pe ), based on which we are able to compute the average duration
of disasters. The term φi,j,t captures the temporary drop and only enters the disaster gap equation.
In contrast, θi,j,t captures the permanent loss. As in Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013),
we assume that the permanent decline does not affect assets or consumption during the disaster,
hence the opposing signs in equations (7) and (8).
We estimate our empirical version of the NSBU model for our consumption, equity, and housing
data separately. The sample consists of countries for which we have data prior to World War 1
(Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Norway, Sweden, UK, USA) in order to ensure sufficient
disasters in the sample and hence allow the model to properly estimate disaster parameters. Since
we directly compare estimation results for assets and consumption, it is furthermore crucial to have
identical data availability among all three models. Table 13 presents the estimates of our main
disaster parameters.
The first row displays the probability of remaining in a disastrous state if a country is currently
exposed to a disaster. Comparing the different assets, we conclude that equity disasters are less
likely to continue followed by consumption and housing disasters. Based on these numbers we
compute the average disaster duration, which equals 4 years for consumption claims, and roughly
3.5 years and 5 years for equity and housing disasters, respectively. Turning attention to the second
row, i.e., short-run drops, we conclude that equity disasters are characterized by much larger
drops than housing, whereas consumption is in between. Finally, in the third row, we see that
equity disasters feature almost no reversal, while housing disasters are associated with a more than
complete recovery. Hence, based on this exercise, we can conclude that—compared to housing
disasters—equity disasters are of shorter duration, feature more significant within-disaster drops,
and experience less recovery.

Notes: This figure shows the median percentage change in D/P ratios in a ±4-year disaster window. We set
parameter estimates for long-run and short-run drops equal to the posterior means as displayed in Table 13.
The average disaster duration equals 3.5 years for equity and 5 years for housing. All idiosyncratic shocks are
shut-off and the mean growth rate is set to zero.

We can visualize results via impulse response functions for ”typical disasters” which, following
Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013), we define as disasters with average duration and
with the short-run and long-run effects equal to their respective posterior means, as in Table 13. All
remaining parameters, in particular the idiosyncratic shocks, are set equal to zero.
These impulse response functions are shown in Figure 5 and they resemble the parameter
estimates highlighted in Table 13. Specifically, we observe much larger within-disaster drops for
equity as compared to housing claims. Further, the graphs are very illustrative with respect to the
long-term impact. Housing disasters are more than offset by subsequent recoveries, while reversal
is very small for equity disasters. Finally, the graphs highlight a stronger peak-to-trough decline for
equity, consistent with the above replication of Barro (2006) in the previous subsection.
The above evidence clearly suggests that equity disasters are worse than housing disasters.
However we still lack one important puzzle piece before we can infer a larger equity premium.
The missing piece relates to the co-movement of asset disasters with consumption disasters. Risk
premiums are ultimately determined by the riskiness of a particular asset in conjunction with its
co-movement with consumption. If equity disasters were totally unrelated to consumption disasters
while housing disasters were not, high marginal utilities due to a consumption disaster would not
align with drops in stock prices and the risk premium would be small or even zero, despite all of
the above.
However, we can provide evidence against this hypothesis too, based on correlations between

32

disaster probabilities for each country. We restrict the sample to observations with a consumption
disaster probability of at least 50% since we are primarily interested in correlations during consumption disaster periods. The numbers are however robust to different specifications. The results
are striking: The correlation between consumption and housing disaster probabilities is negative
(-0.04), but for consumption and equity disasters it is positive (0.19). Consumption disasters tend
to coincide with equity disasters in terms of likelihood, while there is no such pattern for housing
disasters, which strengthens our previous argument.8
To sum up, we are confident that the Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa (2013) extensions,
i.e., partial recovery and disasters that unfold over multiple periods, will likely increase the equity
premium vis-à-vis the baseline Barro (2006) model, but it does not work for housing in the same way.
Equity declines during disasters are more severe than housing declines and recovery is essentially
non-existent. Moreover, the probability of equity disasters co-moves with consumption disasters,
which is also consistent with a sizable risk premium for equity. Yet this is not the case for housing.

6.3.

Muir (2017) with Two Risky Assets

The rare disaster approach teaches us that examining the performance of assets during consumption
disasters could be a useful starting point for evaluating risk premiums. Having reviewed leading
asset pricing models which feature particularly severe disasters, i.e., the rare disaster models of
Barro (2006) and Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro and Ursúa (2013), we now provide empirical facts
regarding the performance of equity and housing dividend yields during different types of disasters,
a granular approach suggested by Muir (2017).
Consumption disasters are inherently volatile and by definition they are associated with drops
in consumption as shown in Table 14. Generally speaking, assets that perform well when marginal
utilities are high should be associated with a low required return. Further, since households care
more about periods in which the marginal utility is high, the risk premium should be largely
determined by asset behavior during disasters.
We find most notably that housing yields fail to respond to disasters at their onset and display
heterogeneous behavior afterwards. Equity dividend yields in contrast, co-move well with the
arrival of a disasters, independent of the type of disaster, and level-off afterwards. Based on these
observations, we would expect a higher premium for equity returns compared to housing returns;
however as we documented in the main body of the paper, this does not seem to be the case.
In line with Muir (2017), we define four different types of disasters—recessions, deep recessions,
financial crises, and wars—and compare dividend price ratios of equity and housing claims before
and after these disasters. Recessions are described as consumption declines smaller than 2%, deep
recessions as collapses of more than 2% in a given year. Wars are characterized as consumption
8 Values

are computed separately for each country and then averaged across all 8 countries. Since we are
predominately interested in correlations during consumption disasters, correlations are based on a subset in
which the posterior mean consumption disaster probability is at least 50%.

Notes: Median disaster percentage change in D/P ratios around a four period window. Recessions are
described as consumption declines smaller than 2%, deep recessions as collapses of more than 2% in a given
year. Wars are characterized as consumption drops during war periods and financial crises are defined as in
Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2017). Consecutive disaster events up to five years are aggregated into one
single event to avoid double counting.

drops during war periods and financial crises are defined as in Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2017),
who follow Laeven and Valencia (2012) in determining financial crises as “events during which a
country’s banking sector experiences bank runs, sharp increases in default rates accompanied by
large losses of capital that result in public intervention, bankruptcy, or forced merger of financial
institutions.” We use dividend yields as a well-established proxy for expected risk premiums, since
dividend yields strongly predict future stock returns and only weakly forecast future dividend
growth (Shiller 1981; Campbell 1988; Campbell and Cochrane 1999).

34

Further insight can be gleaned from Figure 6 which displays the median dividend price change
with reference to 4 years prior to a consumption disaster event split by asset type, with equity on
the left and housing on the right. The left panel highlights that changes in equity dividend yields
are well aligned with the arrival of consumption disaster at period t = 0. Deep recessions are worse
than regular recessions in terms of dividend yields as well, while both are topped by war and
financial crises. Financial crises tend to be the worst, exactly in line with the finding of Muir (2017).
But, as he noted, this finding is puzzling, since wars are associated with the largest peak to trough
consumption declines as well as the largest volatility following a disaster as is evident in Table 14.
We repeat the same exercise for housing dividend yields in the right panel of Figure 6. Most
notably, in contrast to equity claims, housing claims do not contemporaneously respond to consumption disasters and they show a heterogeneous response afterwards. Due to the well established
link between dividend yields and the risk premium, we would hence expect a larger risk premium
for equity versus housing. However, as discussed in the main body of the paper, we observe roughly
equal risk premiums in the data.

6.4.

Campbell and Cochrane (1999) with Two Risky Assets

In an alternative approach to resolving the equity risk premium puzzle, Campbell and Cochrane
(1999) augment the standard Mehra and Prescott (1985) asset pricing model with a slow moving
external habit process following Abel (1990).9 In contrast to the Barro (2006) rare disasters model,
risk premiums are internally propagated and thus don’t rely on large, infrequent exogenous
consumption drops. Intuitively, habits penalize varying consumption growth rates and households
care about their relative performance vis-a-vis the habit level rather than declines in the actual
absolute consumption level.
We re-evaluate the original Campbell and Cochrane (1999) habits model and fit it to our postWW2 balanced sample (1963–2015) for equity, housing, and total returns. We find that habit
formation is able to explain observed equity risk premiums but not housing premiums: that is, as in
the original study, we are able to match the equity risk premium with a coefficient of relative risk
aversion of about 1, but meanwhile an implausibly high risk aversion parameter, way beyond 10, is
then required to match the housing risk premium.
The intuition is that this result is driven by the quite different serial correlation properties of
dividend/price and rent/price ratios. The autocorrelation is around 0.85 for equity dividend/price
ratios but is a much higher 0.96 for housing rent/price ratios. This means that housing rent/price
ratios are going to be much more sluggish in their adjustments, since they have much more powerful
persistence. Note that we also considered the entire sample, and re-ran the autocorrelation estimates.
This resulted in a first order auto-correlation of 0.52 for equity and 0.96 for housing, so this result is
robust. Our results based on the post-WW2 period instead of the entire sample are therefore quite
9 Uhlig

(2007) and Grishchenko (2010), among others, present more recent evidence on habits as a way of
explaining risk premiums.

conservative.
However, for any asset, a more persistent dividend process will require a more smooth “effective
risk aversion.” However, as we now explain, a smooth “effective risk aversion” is then associated
with weak or quickly adjusting habits. In detail, in the Campbell and Cochrane (1999) habits model,
the effect of external habits on the curvature of the utility function can be described by the ”effective
relative risk aversion” (ηt ), which is defined as and equal to
ηt ≡

(9)

where Uc (Ucc ) is the first (second) derivative of a standard CRRA utility function with respect
to consumption and St represents the surplus consumption ratio defined as St =

Ct − Xt
Ct .

Here, Xt

characterizes the external habit, and γ indicates risk aversion absent habits. However with habits,
curvature is enhanced for low values of St , that is, when actual consumption Ct is close to habits
Xt . As a result of this property of the model, Campbell and Cochrane (1999) are able to to generate
reasonable risk premiums on consumption claims even for modest levels of γ.
A crucial target for fitting this model to the data is the serial correlation of equity and housing
dividend price ratios, which–as noted above—is significantly higher for housing (0.96) than for
equity (0.85) in the post-WW2 balanced sample. Persistence in Campbell and Cochrane (1999) is
mainly driven by the adjustment process of the consumption habit characterized by Φ. A large value
of Φ implies slowly moving surplus consumption ratios, which is equivalent to swift adjustments in
habits, i.e., weak habits. Hence, the observed serial correlation of equity streams is associated with
stronger habits than housing dividend yields, which in turn corresponds to a large premium for
equity returns. Table 15 quantifies this verbal argument, where note that returns and premiums are
now measured using a log scale, given this is the correct definition for the habits model setup.
A few features are worth highlighting. Foremost, the results are very sensitive to the degree of
habit persistence. A change of Φ by just 0.05 corresponds to a 2–3 log point change in risk premium

(where 1 log point = 0.01 times 100). We are able to explain the observed equity risk premium
(3.74%) with a risk aversion parameter of less than 2, as is clear in row one. However, housing
dividend yields are more persistent, hence the appropriate row is Φ=0.90 (or higher still). We see
here that a relative risk aversion of 10, which is considered the upper bound of reasonable values in
the literature, is still insufficient to match observed risk premiums (4.50 versus 5.38 log points).
The sensitivity of the model with respect to habits is further illustrated in Figure 7. The plots are
an extension to the previous table and provide model implied risk premiums (vertical axis) for a
range of “reasonable” relative risk aversion parameters (horizontal axis). The left figure relates to
stronger habits and should be consulted to gauge the risk premium on equity, while the right figure
features weaker habits and is hence associated with housing returns. Nevertheless, we plot lines
for equity, housing and total returns in both graphs. The graphs visualize the substantial impact
of habits on the risk premium. Risk premiums are significantly shifted down by roughly 2%-3%
despite a modest change in habit strength. Furthermore, the implied risk premiums with weak
habits level off below 5% at higher relative risk aversion. Thus, it is very difficult to reconcile the
observed housing risk premium with any reasonable choice of relative risk aversion.

6.5.

Bansal and Yaron (2004) with Two Risky Assets

A different approach to resolving the equity premium puzzle proceeds by incorporating highly
persistent long-run risk and news about consumption growth. This idea was pioneered by Bansal
and Yaron (2004) and they showed that both components in combination with Epstein-Zin-Weil

37

preferences (Epstein and Zin 1989; Weil 1989) can yield a risk premium of roughly 7% for a
market portfolio based on CRSP with reasonable choices for the relative risk aversion (10) and the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution (1.5).
In this model, the mechanism depends on high persistence in both components such that a small
shock is able to create a long-lasting almost permanent effect on dividend growth and volatility
which ultimately manifests in large required risk premiums. We will argue that this framework is
not suitable to resolve the housing or total risk premium puzzles.
The intuition for our claim is as follows. Since observed equity and housing returns are roughly
in line, the model implies similar dividend processes with respect to the impact of the risk and news
component. Yet we point out that with an almost identical calibration, model based moments are
inconsistent with data.
Specifically, the Bansal and Yaron (2004) model induces a tight link between correlation of
the dividend and consumption processes and the resulting model-implied risk premium. Since
we observe higher correlations between equity returns and consumption as compared to housing
returns and consumption, it is inevitable that the model cannot generate similar risk premiums for
equity and housing.
The previously mentioned link between risk premium and correlation manifests in the news
component, which is the only source of co-movement among assets and consumption in the model.
At the same time news about future growth is crucial for deriving a large risk premium even more
than the risk component. Consequently, the model implicitly ties co-movement with risk premiums
for reasonably calibrated values.
In the data, equity returns are more volatile than housing returns. A proper calibration therefore
requires us to either increase the dependence on uncertainty and/or news, as both, ceteris paribus,
increase volatility. Raising the dependence on the predictable growth component generates the
aforementioned problem, but increasing the impact of uncertainty generates another problem: It
decreases the correlation between consumption and dividend stream. Hence both options, necessary
for a good calibration, cause the model to fail when attempting to reconcile the housing and total
risk premium puzzles.
In what follows we provide theoretical and empirical support by expanding the Bansal and
Yaron (2004) model. The dynamics of the our expanded model are characterized by four equations:
a consumption and dividend growth process as well as processes guiding the news component
and uncertainty. xt represents news, gt and g j,t the consumption and asset growth rate where
j ∈ {Equity, Housing}. σt2 refers to time-varying economic uncertainty. All remaining parameters
correspond to unconditional means, loadings to uncertainty and news, and the persistence thereof.

With idiosyncratic error terms, the co-variance between dividend growth rates and consumption
growth rates is pinned down by φj and the volatility for each asset by a combination of φj and
χ j . Further, distinct characteristics of equity and housing returns are characterized by the two
parameters φj and χ j only.
We calibrate the model using values in Bansal and Yaron (2004) for all parameters except the
mean growth rates, which are straightforward to compute from our raw data, with one exception.
The key difference relates to coefficient governing the loading for the news component. To account
for the stronger correlation between equity and consumption streams plus the higher volatility of
the former, we set the value to φe = 5 for equity and φh = 3 for housing. As we just explained,
modifying the loading towards uncertainty generates a problematic trade-off between volatility and
co-movement, hence we there decided to keep the value proposed in Bansal and Yaron (2004).
Table 16 highlights the impact of distinct news loading on the correlation with consumption
and volatility. The large value for equity clearly leads to both higher volatility as well as a stronger
correlation with consumption growth. The model fit is reasonable with respect to the standard
deviation and correlation, but poor with respect to the autocorrelation. This finding is in line
with Bansal and Yaron (2004) and due to equation (12), which suggests that comovement with
consumption can only be achieved via higher autocorrelation.

The model predictions for risk premiums are summarized in Table 17. Most importantly, the
annualized risk premium for equity is significantly higher than for housing. The difference in the
risk premium equals 6% and purely results from a distinct loading towards news. Thus fitting the
dividend growth equation to data yields a much larger risk premium for equity returns than for
housing returns, whereas in the data these are equal.
To conclude, we are not able match the observed risk premiums for our equity and housing data.
While the overall level of excess returns could be lowered by, for example, slightly lowering the
persistence of the predictable consumption component, the qualitative difference between the risk
premiums remains. Similar risk premiums require a similar calibration of the processes governing
the dividend growth rates, which ultimately yields inconsistent simulated moments.

Conclusions

The risk premium puzzle is worse than you think. The unadorned, benchmark, representative-agent,
consumption-based asset pricing model implies an absurdly high risk-aversion parameter, because
equity returns have low risk (low covariance with consumption-growth) but high excess returns
(relative to safe assets). A gigantic research program has sought to ameliorate or explain away this
puzzle, but the bar has been set too low: by ignoring half of total wealth invested outside firm
equity, specifically in housing, the literature has hitherto avoided a more serious challenge.
Using a new database for the U.S. and 15 other advanced economies, from 1870 to the present,
including housing as well as equities, we perform standard calculations using returns to equity,
housing, and total wealth, and consumption growth, to show that the total risk premium puzzle is
even bigger. Housing returns are comparable to those of equities and yet housing returns have even
lower covariance with consumption growth than equities. The same also holds for a total-wealth
portfolio, and over a range of horizons.
The implied risk aversion parameters for housing wealth and total wealth are even larger than
those for equities, often by a factor of 2 or more. A variety of standard adjustments to the benchmark
representative-agent model also appear to be unable to resolve these even bigger puzzles, since in all
models, whether standard or exotic, the time series properties of housing and equity returns imply
that the former should have a much lower risk premium than the latter, yet this is contradicted by
the historical data.

A.

Derivation of the Extended Barro (2006) model with Risky Assets

The original Barro (2006) model features a standard Lucas-Tree type model with an exogenous
endowment, as in Mehra and Prescott (1985), augmented for one period rare disasters. We modify
the economy and introduce risky assets. To keep things tractable and derive a closed form solution,
we assume that asset disasters coincide with consumption disasters. Hence, a consumption crisis
automatically triggers an asset crises, whereat the magnitude of the asset crisis is determined based
on empirical grounds. To fix ideas, Barro (2006) assumes the following exogenous evolution of the
endowment:
log( At+1 ) = log( At ) + γ + ut+1 + vt+1

(14)

where At denotes endowment which is equal to consumption in equilibrium, γ its long-run growth
rate and ut is i.i.d. normal with mean zero and variance σ2 . The term vt captures rare disasters
and equals log(1 − b) in bad times with probability p and zero with probability 1 − p. b in turn is a
random variables and captures the fractional consumption decline during disasters, which we derive
based on peak to trough consumption declines. We assume dividends follow a similar process and
denote variables related to assets with a tilde.
log( Ãt+1 ) = log( Ãt ) + γ̃ + ũt+1 + ṽt+1

(15)

Each of the parameters associated with the dividend process is calibrated on asset data and hence
distinct from the parameters chosen for the consumption claim. The only exception pertains to
asset disaster probabilities. In order to derive an analytical solution we assume that asset disasters
coincide with consumption disasters and calibrate this probability based on consumption data
only. However, we do not make an assumption on the relationship between the fractional declines
of consumption (b) and assets (d) during disasters. We further introduce correlation between
consumption and dividend claims during normal times, hence we allow for a non-zero correlation
(κ) between ut+1 and ũt+1 .
In the remainder of the appendix, we derive a closed form solution for the asset return logEt [ R̃t+1 ]
which we combine with the formula for the risk free rate in Barro (2006) to derive the risk premium
presented in the main body of the paper. As in Barro (2006) we assume a standard CRRA utility
function. ρ ≥ 0 deontes the rate of time preference and θ > 0 the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
The Euler Equation for asset holdings corresponds to:
θ
−ρ
−θ
A−
t = e Et [ At+1 R̃t+1 ]

(16)

θ
θ
P̃t = e−ρ Et [ A−
t+1 Ãt+1 ] At

(17)

which is equivalent to

A-1

due to the definition of the risky asset return R̃t+1 =

Ãt+1

P̃t

We can rewrite the expectations operator

as
θ
−θ −θγ −θut+1 −θvt+1
Et [ A−
e
e
Ãt eγ̃ eũt+1 eṽt+1 ]
t+1 Ãt+1 ] = Et [ At e

(18)

Since we condition on period t we pull out constants as well as period t variables, hence:
θ
−θ −θγ
Et [ A−
Ãt eγ̃ Et [e−θut+1 e−θvt+1 eũt+1 eṽt+1 ]
t+1 Ãt+1 ] = At e

(19)

We once again focus on the expectations operator and decompose it into:
Et [e−θut+1 e−θvt+1 eũt+1 eṽt+1 ] = Et [e−θut+1 eũt+1 ] Et [eṽt+1 e−θvt+1 ]

(20)

Equivalence holds since idiosyncratic shocks are independent of crises. u and ũ follow a normal
distribution with correlation κ. Further, the sum of normal distributed variables is normal distributed.
Hence,
Et [e−θut+1 eũt+1 ] = Et [eũt+1 −θut+1 ] = e

θ 2 σ2
σ̃2
2 + 2 − θκσ σ̃

(21)

The second term involving expectations in Equation (7) depends on three random variables. A
Bernoulli distributed variable on disaster occurrence independent of the fractional decline in
consumption and the asset, and the fractional declines in consumption and asset claims, b and d.
We can thus rewrite the expression as
Et [eṽt+1 e−θvt+1 ] = pE[(1 − b)−θ (1 − d)] + 1 − p

(22)

Technically, the expectations operator is conditioning on period t, however disaster declines are
assumed to be independently distributed across time, hence we omit indexation. Once we plug the
previous equations in Equation (4), the asset price can be determined as
P̃t = Ãt e−ρ−θγ+γ̃+

θ 2 σ2
σ̃2
2 + 2 − θκσ σ̃

[ pE[(1 − b)−θ (1 − d)] + 1 − p]

(23)

Last but not least, we plug the asset price into the gross return formula. The derivation of Et [ Ãt+1 ]
is analogous to Barro (2006) and omitted.
σ̃2

Et [ Ãt+1 ]
eγ̃+ 2 [ pE[1 − d] + 1 − p]
Et [ R̃t+1 ] =

σ̃
θ 2 σ2
P̃t
e−ρ−θγ+γ̃+ 2 + 2 −θκσσ̃ [ pE[(1 − b)−θ (1 − d)] + 1 − p]

(24)

Taking logs results in the following approximation
logEt [ R̃t+1 ] ≈ ρ + θγ −

h
i
θ 2 σ2
+ θκσσ̃ − p[ E (1 − b)−θ (1 − d) + E[d] − 1]

Equation (12) nests the risky return on consumption claims in Barro (2006) with d = b and κ = 1.

B. Our MS-VAR Version of the Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursúa
(2013) Model with Risky Assets
We standardize, pool all observations and estimate a Markov Switching VAR with two regimes, a
crisis and a non-crisis regime.
We estimate an MS-VAR correlation matrix for the crisis regime as follows:

MS-VAR: Correlation Matrix Crisis Regime
C

H

E

C

1.0000

0.1615

0.2542

H

0.1615

1.0000

0.1755

E

0.2542

0.1755

1.0000

The correlation matrix is based on standardized pooled data and two regimes.
We only report here the correlation matrix for the crisis regime. The striking feature of the
correlation matrix is the difference between the correlation between consumption and housing (0.16),
and consumption and equity (0.25).
Thus equity crises tend to be more in line with consumption crises than housing crises, which
consequently strengthens our previous findings.
Despite the limitations, the VAR exercise hints towards a larger risk premium for equity.
