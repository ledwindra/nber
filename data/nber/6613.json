    "abstract": "\n\nTwo striking facts describe work timing in the United States: a lower propensity to work evenings and nights in large metropolitan areas, and a secular decline in such work since 1973.  One explanation is higher and possibly increasing crime in large areas.  I link Current Population Survey data on work timing to FBI crime reports.  Neither fact is explained by changes in nor inter-area differences in crime rates, but higher homicide rates do reduce such work.  This reduction implicitly costs the economy between $4 and $10 billion.  This negative externality illustrates a larger class of previously unmeasured costs of social pathologies.\n\n",
