The Effects of Exposure to Better Neighborhoods on Children: New Evidence from the Moving
to Opportunity Experiment

NBER Working Paper No. 21156
May 2015, Revised Septemberr 2015

ABSTRACT
The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment offered randomly selected families living in highpoverty housing projects housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods. We present new
evidence on the impacts of MTO on children's long-term outcomes using administrative data from
tax returns. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college attendance
rates and earnings for children who were young (below age 13) when their families moved. These
children also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults and are less likely to become single
parents. The treatment effects are substantial: children whose families take up an experimental voucher
to move to a lower-poverty area when they are less than 13 years old have an annual income that is
$3,477 (31%) higher on average relative to a mean of $11,270 in the control group in their mid-twenties.
In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative long-term impacts on children who are more
than 13 years old when their families move, perhaps because of the disruption effects of moving to
a very different environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when children move, consistent
with recent evidence that the duration of exposure to a better environment during childhood is a key
determinant of an individual's long-term outcomes. The findings imply that offering vouchers to move
to lower-poverty neighborhoods to families with young children who are living in high- poverty housing
projects may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty and ultimately generate positive returns
for taxpayers.

Individuals who live in high-poverty areas fare worse than those who live in lower-poverty
neighborhoods on a wide range of economic, health, and educational outcomes.1 Motivated by
such disparities in outcomes across neighborhoods, the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development offered a randomly selected
subset of families living in high-poverty housing projects subsidized housing vouchers to move to
lower-poverty neighborhoods in the mid-1990s. The MTO experiment generated large differences
in neighborhood environments for comparable families, providing an opportunity to evaluate the
causal effects of improving neighborhood environments for low-income families (Ludwig et al. 2013).
Previous research evaluating the MTO experiment has found that moving to lower-poverty areas
greatly improved the mental health, physical health, and subjective well being of adults as well
as family safety (e.g., Katz et al. 2001, Kling et al. 2007, Clampet-Lundquist and Massey 2008,
Ludwig et al. 2013). But these studies have consistently found that the MTO treatments had no
significant impacts on the earnings and employment rates of adults and older youth, suggesting
that neighborhood environments might be less important for economic success.
In this paper, we revisit the MTO experiment and focus on its long-term impacts on children who
were young when their families moved to better neighborhoods. Our analysis is motivated by recent
evidence that the amount of time individuals spend in a given neighborhood during their childhood
is a key determinant of that neighborhood’s effects on their long-term outcomes.2 Crowder and
South (2011) and Wodtke et al. (2011) show that the fraction of childhood spent in high-poverty
areas is negatively correlated with outcomes such as high-school completion. Chetty and Hendren
(2015) study more than five million families that move across areas and find that neighborhoods have
causal exposure effects on children’s outcomes using quasi-experimental methods. In particular,
every year spent in a better area during childhood increases college attendance rates and earnings
in adulthood, so the gains from moving to a better area are larger for children who are younger at
the time of the move.
In light of this evidence on childhood exposure effects, we test two hypotheses in the MTO data.
First, we hypothesize that moving to a lower-poverty area improves long-term economic outcomes
for children who were young at the point of random assignment (RA). Second, we hypothesize that
the gains from moving to a lower-poverty area decline with a child’s age at move. Prior work has

Brooks-Gunn (2000), and Sampson et al. (2002).
2
The idea that the length of exposure to neighborhoods might matter has been recognized since Wilson (1987)
and Jencks and Mayer (1990). Importantly, we focus here on exposure effects during childhood ; as we discuss below,
we find no evidence of exposure effects for adults.

1

not been able to study these issues because the younger children in the MTO experiment are only
now old enough to be entering the adult labor market. We present new evidence on the impacts of
MTO on children’s earnings, college attendance rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by linking
the MTO data to federal income tax returns.
The MTO experiment was conducted between 1994 and 1998 in five large U.S. cities. The
experimental sample included 4,604 families, who were randomly assigned to one of three groups:
an experimental voucher group that was offered a subsidized housing voucher that came with a
requirement to move to a census tract with a poverty rate below 10%, a Section 8 voucher group
that was offered a standard subsidized housing voucher with no additional contingencies, and a
control group that was not offered a voucher (but retained access to public housing).
We begin our analysis by evaluating the impacts of MTO on young children, whom we define
in our baseline analysis as those below age 13 at RA.3 These children are 8 years old on average at
RA. Among these children, 48% of those in the experimental voucher group took up the voucher
to move to a low-poverty area, while 66% of those in the Section 8 group took up the vouchers
they were offered. Children growing up in the three groups experienced very different childhood
environments. On average from the date of RA until age 18, children below age 13 at RA in the
control group lived in census tracts with a mean poverty rate of 41%. Children whose families took
up the experimental voucher lived in census tracts with 22 percentage point lower poverty rates
than those in the control group on average until age 18. Those who took up the Section 8 voucher
lived in census tracts with 12 percentage point lower poverty rates than the control group.
We estimate the treatment effects of growing up in these very different environments by replicating the intent-to-treat (ITT) specifications used in prior work (e.g., Kling et al. 2007), regressing
outcomes in adulthood on indicators for assignment to each of the treatment arms. We find that
assignment to the experimental voucher group led to significant improvements on a broad spectrum
of outcomes in adulthood for children who were less than age 13 at RA. Children assigned to the
experimental voucher group before they turned 13 have incomes that are $1,624 higher on average
relative to the control group in their mid-twenties (p < 0.05). Given the experimental voucher
takeup rate of 48%, this translates to a treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimate for those who
took up the experimental voucher of $3,477, a 31% increase relative to the control group mean of
3

We limit our sample to children who are at least 21 by 2012, the last year for which we have data from tax
returns. Because of this restriction, our “below age 13” sample only includes children who were between the ages of
4 and 12 at random assignment. As we discuss below, we find similar results when defining “young children” using
other cutoffs, e.g. those below age 12 or 14.

2

$11,270. Children assigned to the experimental voucher group before they turn 13 are also significantly more likely to attend college and attend better colleges. The ITT effect on college attendance
between the ages of 18-20 is a 2.5 percentage point (16%) increase relative to the control group
mean attendance rate of 16.5%. Finally, children assigned to the experimental voucher group before
age 13 also live in lower-poverty neighborhoods themselves as adults and are less likely to be single
parents themselves (for females).4
Children whose families were assigned to the Section 8 voucher group before they turned 13
generally have mean outcomes between the control and experimental group means. For example,
the TOT estimate for individual income is $1,723 for the Section 8 voucher relative to the control
among children below age 13 at RA. This impact is 50% of the TOT estimate for the experimental
voucher, which is consistent with the fact that the Section 8 voucher reduced mean neighborhood
poverty rates by approximately half as much as the experimental voucher for those who took up
the vouchers. Note that households in the Section 8 group could have chosen to make exactly
the same moves as those in the experimental group. The fact that the experimental voucher had
larger effects on children’s outcomes than the Section 8 voucher therefore suggests that actively
encouraging families to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods – either through counseling or by
restricting their choice set – increases the impacts of housing vouchers on young children’s longterm economic success.
The MTO treatments had very different effects on older children – those between 13-18 at RA,
who were 15 years old on average at that point. In most cases, we find statistically insignificant
differences between mean outcomes in the three treatment arms among older children. The point
estimates suggest that, if anything, moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood had slightly negative
effects on older children’s outcomes. For example, the ITT impact of the experimental voucher is
-$967 on individual income among children who were 13-18 at RA. One potential explanation for
these negative impacts at older ages is a disruption effect: moving to a very different environment,
especially as an adolescent, could disrupt social networks and have other adverse effects on child
development (Coleman 1988, Wood et al. 1993, South et al. 2007).5
4

We define a mother as a “single parent” if she has a child whose father’s name is not listed on the child’s social
security application, which is typically submitted at birth.
5
Importantly, these disruption costs appear to be a function of where a family moves rather than a fixed cost of
moving to a different home. Most families in both the control and treatment groups moved several times while their
children were growing up (Ludwig et al. 2013). However, families who moved using the subsidized housing vouchers
– especially the experimental vouchers – moved to very different neighborhoods that were further away from the
housing projects where they started. Disruption costs are presumably larger for children who move to a very different
area, e.g. because of a loss of social networks (Coleman 1988). Consistent with this explanation, TOT estimates show
a somewhat larger adverse impact of MTO moves on older children in the experimental voucher group as compared

3

We explore the robustness of these findings by estimating models that interact age at RA linearly
with the treatment indicators. We find robust evidence that the gains from moving to lower-poverty
areas decline with the child’s age at move, suggesting that every extra year of exposure to a lowpoverty environment during childhood is beneficial. We do not find any clear evidence of a “critical
age” below which children must move to benefit from a better neighborhood, although one cannot
obtain very precise estimates of the age profile of exposure effects from the MTO data because of
the small sample sizes at each child age.
Putting the results together, the effects of moving to a better neighborhood on children’s longterm economic outcomes can be explained by a simple model featuring a disruption cost of substantially changing one’s neighborhood environment coupled with benefits that are proportional
to amount of exposure to a lower-poverty environment during childhood. The exposure effects
outweigh the disruption cost for children who move when young, but not for children who move
at older ages. Although our findings are consistent with such a model of exposure effects, the
MTO experimental design cannot be used to conclusively establish that childhood exposure to a
better environment has a causal effect on long-term outcomes because the ages at which children
move are perfectly correlated with their length of exposure to a lower-poverty neighborhood. As a
result, we cannot distinguish differences in disruption effects by age at the time of a move from an
age-invariant disruption cost coupled with an exposure effect. Moreover, the treatment effects for
families with young vs. old children could differ because the set of families who took up the voucher
and the areas to which they moved might vary between the two groups. Nonetheless, regardless of
the underlying mechanisms, the experimental results are adequate to conclude that providing subsidized housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty areas yields produces larger benefits for younger
children.
We find that the MTO treatments had little or no impact on adults’ economic outcomes,
consistent with prior work (e.g., Ludwig et al. 2013).6 The experimental voucher TOT estimate on
individual earnings is -$734 (a 4.7% reduction) and the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval
is a 12% increase, well below the estimated impacts for young children. We find no evidence of
exposure effects among adults, in contrast with the observational correlations reported by ClampetLundquist and Massey (2008). The earnings impacts for adults do not increase over time after RA,
to the Section 8 group.
6
Our findings regarding the impacts of MTO on children are also consistent with prior research. If we restrict
ourselves to the data available in prior work (up to 2008) and do not split children by age at move, we detect no
impact of the MTO treatments on children’s economic outcomes.

4

despite the fact that cumulative exposure to lower-poverty areas rose significantly.
Prior studies of MTO have detected heterogeneity in short-run and medium-term treatment
effects by child gender and experimental site (e.g., Kling et al. 2007). We find no systematic
differences in the treatment effects of MTO on children’s long-term outcomes by gender, race, or
site. In particular, the point estimates of the effect of the experimental voucher on earnings are
positive for all five experimental sites, for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics, and for boys and girls for
children below the age of 13 at RA. The corresponding point estimates are almost all negative for
children above the age of 13 at RA. Most notably, we find robust, statistically significant evidence
that the experimental voucher improved long-term outcomes for (young) boys, a subgroup where
prior studies found little evidence of medium-term gains.
Previous explorations of heterogeneity in treatment effects in the MTO data raise concerns that
our results – which essentially explore heterogeneity in the new dimension of child’s age at move
– are an artifact of multiple hypothesis testing. A post-hoc analysis of a randomized experiment
will generate some p-values that appear to be “statistically significant” (e.g., p < 0.05) purely by
chance if one examines a sufficiently large number of subgroups. To address this concern, we test
the omnibus null hypothesis that the treatment effects for the main subgroups studied in MTO
research to date (based on gender, race, site, and age) are all zero using parametric F tests and
a nonparametric permutation test. We reject the null hypothesis of zero treatment effects in all
subgroups with p < 0.05 for most outcomes using F tests of interaction terms of treatment group
and subgroup indicators. The permutation test yields p < 0.01 for the null hypothesis that the MTO
treatments had no effect on any of the outcomes we study for children below 13 at RA, adjusting
for multiple hypothesis testing across all the subgroups. The results imply that the significant
treatment effects we detect for younger children are unlikely to be an artifact of analyzing multiple
subgroups. In addition, we returned to the MTO data with a pre-specified hypothesis that we
would find larger impacts for younger children, based on the quasi-experimental evidence in Chetty
and Hendren (2015). The fact that the experimental results closely match the quasi-experimental
evidence makes it less likely that these results are spuriously generated by multiple hypothesis
testing.
We conclude that the Moving to Opportunity experiment generated substantial gains for children who moved to lower-poverty neighborhoods when they were young. We estimate that moving
a child out of public housing to a low-poverty area when young (at age 8 on average) using an
MTO-type experimental voucher will increase the child’s total lifetime earnings by about $302, 000.
5

This is equivalent to a gain of $99,000 per child moved in present value at age 8, discounting future
earnings at a 3% interest rate. The increased earnings of children ultimately leads to significant
benefits to taxpayers as well. Children whose families took up experimental vouchers before they
were 13 pay an extra $394 per year in federal income taxes during their mid-twenties. If these gains
persist in subsequent years of adulthood, the additional tax revenue obtained from these children
will itself offset the incremental cost of the experimental voucher treatment relative to providing
public housing. Thus, our findings suggest that housing vouchers which (1) require families to move
to lower-poverty areas and (2) are targeted at low-income families with young children can reduce
the intergenerational persistence of poverty and ultimately save the government money.
The paper is organized as follows. Section I summarizes the key features of the MTO experiment.
Section II describes the data sources and reports summary statistics and tests for balance across
the experimental groups. We present our main results in Section III. In Section IV, we reconcile our
new findings with prior research on MTO. Section V presents a cost-benefit analysis and discusses
policy implications. We conclude in Section VI by interpreting our findings in the context of the
broader literature on neighborhood effects.

I. The Moving to Opportunity Experiment
In this section, we briefly summarize the key features of the MTO experiment; see Sanbonmatsu
et al. (2011) for a more comprehensive description. The MTO randomized housing mobility
demonstration, conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
enrolled 4,604 low-income families living in five U.S. cities – Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and New York – from 1994 to 1998. Families were eligible to participate in MTO if
they had children and resided in public housing or project-based Section 8 assisted housing in
high-poverty census tracts (those with a 1990 poverty rate of 40% or more).
Families were randomized into three groups: i) the experimental group, which received housing
vouchers that subsidized private-market rents and could initially (for the first year) only be used
in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10%; ii) the Section 8 group, which received regular
housing vouchers without any MTO-specific relocation constraint; and iii) a control group, which
received no assistance through MTO. Those in the experimental group also received additional
housing-mobility counseling from a local nonprofit organization. The experimental vouchers became
regular Section 8 vouchers after a year and were no longer restricted to low-poverty census tracts.
Families assigned to the experimental and Section 8 groups had 4-6 months to lease an apartment
6

and use their vouchers.
Families in all three groups were required to contribute 30% of their annual household income
toward rent and utilities. Those assigned to the experimental or Section 8 voucher groups received
housing vouchers that covered the difference between their rent and the family’s contribution, up
to a maximum amount known as the Fair Market Rent, defined as the 40th percentile of rental
costs in a metro area. Families remained eligible for these vouchers (or public housing projects)
indefinitely as long their income was below 50 percent of the median income in their metro area.
The proportion of individuals randomly assigned to the three groups at each site was changed
during the course of the experiment because take-up of the MTO vouchers turned out to differ from
projections. All the statistics reported in this paper use sampling weights in which individuals are
weighed by the inverse of their probability of assignment to their treatment group to account for
changes in the random-assignment ratios over time.7

II. Data
We draw information from two datasets: HUD files on the MTO participants and federal income
tax records. This section describes the two data sources and key variable definitions. It then
provides descriptive statistics and tests for balance across the MTO treatment groups.

II. A. MTO Data
The MTO dataset contains information on 4,604 households and 15,892 individuals who participated in the experiment. This study examines the impacts of MTO on outcomes typically observed
at age 21 or older. Since the last year in the tax data is currently 2012, we restrict the MTO sample
to the 13,213 individuals who are 21 or older in 2012 (those born in or before 1991). We focus
much of our analysis on MTO children, defined as individuals who were 18 years old or younger
at the time of RA and residing at that time in a household that participated in MTO. There are
11,276 children in the MTO data, of whom 8,603 (76%) were born in or before 1991.
For each MTO participant, we use two sets of information from the MTO dataset. First,
we obtain information on individual and household background characteristics from the MTO
Participant Baseline Survey. The baseline survey was administered to each MTO household head at
the time of program enrollment (prior to RA). The survey provides demographic and socioeconomic
7
See Orr et al. (2003) for the details on the variation in random-assignment ratios over time and the construction
of the MTO sample weights. The weights prevent time or cohort effects from confounding the results. The weights
we use are the same as the weights used for the analysis of administrative data in past MTO work.

7

background information on each household member (adults and children) including information on
children’s school experiences, household criminal victimization, reasons for wanting to participate
in MTO, and household income and transfer receipt. See Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011) for more
detailed information on the background characteristics of the MTO participants and the baseline
survey.
Second, we obtain yearly information on the residential neighborhood (census tract) for each
MTO participant using address history data from the MTO long-term survey conducted in 20082010, as in Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011). We estimate census tract poverty rates in each year by
interpolating census tract poverty rates using the 1990 and 2000 Censuses and the 2005-2009
American Community Surveys. We use this information to construct a measure of each MTO
child’s exposure to poverty (mean tract poverty rate) from the time of RA to age 18.

II. B. Tax Data
We link the MTO data to data from federal income tax records spanning 1996 to 2012.8 HUD
collected social security numbers (SSNs) prior to RA for 90% (11,892) of the individuals who
participated in the MTO experiment and were born in or before 1991. The MTO records were linked
to the tax data by SSN. Of the MTO records with a valid SSN, 99% (11,780) were successfully
linked to the tax data. To protect confidentiality, individual identifiers were removed from the
linked dataset prior to the statistical analysis.
The tax data include both income tax returns (1040 forms) and third-party information returns
(e.g., W-2 forms), which give us information on the earnings of those who do not file tax returns
as well as data on other outcomes, such as college attendance. Here, we define the key variables
we use in our analysis. We measure all monetary values in real 2012 dollars, adjusting for inflation
using the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).
Income. Our primary measure of income is “individual earnings.” Individual earnings is defined
as the sum of income from W-2 forms filed by employers (summed across all W-2s for the individual
in each year) and “non W-2 earnings.” Non W-2 earnings is defined as adjusted gross income on
form 1040 minus own and spouse’s W-2 earnings, UI benefits, and SSDI payments, and is divided
by 2 for married households. Hence, non-W-2 earnings reflects income from self-employment and
other activities not captured on W-2s. Non-W-2 earnings is recoded to 0 if negative and is defined
as 0 for non-filers. If an individual has no tax return and no W-2 earnings, individual earnings is
8

Here and in what follows, the year refers to the tax year (i.e., the calendar year in which the income is earned).

8

coded as zero.
We also report effects on household income. For those who file tax returns, we define household
income as Adjusted Gross Income (as reported on the 1040 tax return) plus tax-exempt interest
income and the non-taxable portion of Social Security and Disability benefits. In years when an
individual does not file a tax return, we define household income as the sum of the individual’s
wage earnings (reported on form W-2), unemployment benefits (reported on form 1099-G), and
gross social security and disability benefits (reported on form SSA-1099).9
College Attendance. We define college attendance at age a as an indicator for having a 1098T form filed on one’s behalf during the calendar year in which the child turns age a. Title IV
institutions – all colleges and universities as well as vocational schools and other post-secondary
institutions eligible for federal student aid – are required to file 1098-T forms that report tuition
payments or scholarships received for every student. These 1098-T data are available from 19992012. Because the 1098-T forms are filed directly by colleges independent of whether an individual
files a tax return, we have records on college attendance for almost all children.10 Comparisons to
other data sources indicate that 1098-T forms capture college enrollment quite accurately overall
(Chetty et al. 2014, Appendix B). In particular, the correlation between enrollment counts based
on 1098-T forms and enrollment counts in the IPEDS dataset from the Department of Education
exceeds 0.95.
College Quality. Using data from 1098-T forms, Chetty et al. (2014) construct an earningsbased index of “college quality” using the mean individual wage earnings at age 31 of children born
in 1979-80 based on the college they attended at age 20. For those not enrolled in any college at
age 20, the index equals the mean earnings at age 31 of all U.S. residents not enrolled in college at
age 20. We define college quality at age a based on the college in which the child was enrolled at
age a (inflated to 2012 dollars using the CPI-U).
Neighborhood Characteristics in Adulthood. We measure the characteristics of the neighborhoods
where children live in adulthood using information on ZIP codes from the tax data.11 We assign
each individual a ZIP code in each year using a sequential algorithm starting with the location from
9

For non-filers, our definition of “household income” does not include the spouse’s income. This is likely to be of
minor consequence because the vast majority of non-filers in the U.S. who are not receiving Social Security benefits
are single (Cilke 1998, Table I).
10
Colleges are not required to file 1098-T forms for students whose qualified tuition and related expenses are
waived or paid entirely with scholarships or grants. However, the forms are typically available even for such cases,
presumably because of automated reporting to the IRS by universities. Approximately 6% of 1098-T forms are
missing from 2000-2003 because the database contains no 1098-T forms for some small colleges in these years.
11
The tax data do not currently contain information on census tracts, so we are forced to use a broader ZIP code
measure when analyzing children’s location in adulthood.

9

which the individual files his tax return (form 1040). If the individual does not file a tax return, we
obtain their ZIP code from form W-2, followed by other information returns (e.g. 1099s). We use
this information to measure the following characteristics of the individual’s ZIP code using data
from the 2000 Census: poverty share (share of households below the poverty line), mean income
(aggregate income in the ZIP code divided by the number of individuals 16-64 years old), black
share (number of people who are black alone divided by total population in 2000) and single mother
share (number of households with female heads and no husband present with own children present
divided by the total number of households with own children present).
Marital Status and Fertility. We define an individual as married if he or she files a tax return
as a married individual in a given year. We measure fertility patterns using data through June
2014 from the Kidlink (DM-2) database provided to the IRS by the Social Security Administration,
which contains information from applications for social security numbers (SSNs). SSN applications
request the SSN of both the mother and father (if present), allowing us to link parents to their
children.12 We define a woman as having a birth if she had a child before June 2014 and having
a teenage birth if she had a child between the ages of 13 and 19. Most people apply for SSN’s for
their children at birth because an SSN is required to claim a child as a dependent on tax returns
and for various other purposes. We therefore define an indicator for whether the father was present
at a child’s birth based on whether a father is listed on the child’s SSN application.
Tax Filing and Taxes Paid. We define tax filing as an indicator for filing a 1040 tax return and
total taxes paid as the total tax field from form 1040 for filers and total taxes withheld on W-2
forms for non-filers.

II. C. Balance Tests and Summary Statistics
Prior research has documented that baseline characteristics are balanced between the treatment
and control groups for both MTO adults and children, as would be expected in an experiment
with random assignment (Kling et al. 2007). Here, we replicate these balance tests on the linked
MTO-Tax Data to ensure that we retain balance in the subgroup that we are able to link to the
tax data.
In our core analysis, we split children into two groups: those below age 13 at RA and those
between ages 13-18 at RA. Table 1 reports summary statistics and balance tests for selected baseline
covariates for these two groups. Appendix Table 1a replicates Table 1 for the broader set of

The total count of births in the DM-2 data differ from CDC vital statistics counts by less than 2% from 1987-2006,

52 baseline covariates used in the MTO interim and final impact evaluations (Kling et al. 2007,
Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011).
We match 86.4% of younger children and 83.8% of the older MTO children to the tax data.
The match rates do not differ significantly between the control and treatment groups. This is to
be expected because the SSN’s that we use to link the MTO data to the tax data were collected
prior to random assignment and we successfully link 99% of the individuals with valid SSNs to the
tax data. Thus, there is virtually no scope for differential attrition across the three treatment arms
in the linked dataset. Consistent with the lack of differential attrition, the distribution of baseline
covariates appears to be balanced in the linked MTO-Tax data data. 13 of the 196 differences
reported in Appendix Table 1a are significant with p < 0.05 and 2 of the 196 are significant with
p < 0.01 based on t-tests that do not adjust for multiple comparisons, in line with what one would
expect under random assignment.
The summary statistics in Table 1 show that families who participated in MTO were quite
economically disadvantaged. Approximately one-third of the MTO household heads had completed high school, only one quarter were employed, three-quarters were receiving public assistance
(AFDC/TANF), more than half had never been married, and a quarter had been teenage parents
at the point of random assignment. Around three-quarters of applicants reported getting away
from gangs and drugs as one of the most important reasons for enrolling in MTO, and over 40%
of the households had been victims of crime in the previous five years. The vast majority of the
household heads were African-American or Hispanic females. Among the older children (ages 13-18
at RA), nearly 20% had been suspended or expelled from school in the past two years.
Appendix Table 1b reports summary statistics on children’s long-term outcomes. Mean individual earnings is $11,739 at age 24, rising to $14,269 at age 28. College attendance rates are 18-19%
over the ages 19-21. Roughly 22% of the females give birth to a child as a teenager. On average,
63% of the sample files a tax return (form 1040) in any given year after they turn 24.

III. Analysis and Results
In our core analysis, we split the 7,340 children in our linked analysis sample into two groups: (1)
children younger than adolescence (less than 13 years) at RA and (2) adolescent children (those 13
to 18 years old) at RA.13 The children in the younger group were 8.2 years old at RA on average,
13

MTO moves typically occurred within six months of RA, so a child’s age at RA is essentially the child’s age at
the time of the move.

11

while those in the older group were 15.1 years old on average (Table 1). This split at age 13 yields
approximately the same number of observations for the younger and older groups for analyses of
outcomes such as earnings in early adulthood. We report estimates with different age cutoffs and
use linear interaction models to evaluate the robustness of the results in Section III.G.
Within each of these two groups, we estimate “intent-to-treat” (ITT) effects of the MTO treatments, which are essentially differences between treatment and control group means. Following the
standard approach used in prior evaluations of MTO (e.g., Kling et al. 2007), we estimate ITT
effects on an outcome (y) using OLS regression specifications of the form:

IT T
yi = α + βE
Expi + βSIT T S8i + γXi + si δ + i

(1)

where Exp and S8 are indicator variables for being randomly assigned to the experimental and
Section 8 groups respectively, X is a vector of baseline covariates, and s is a set of indicators
for randomization site. All of our regressions are weighted to adjust for differences in sampling
probabilities (randomization rates into the different treatment groups) across sites and over time.
We cluster the standard errors by family (allowing for common error components across siblings)
because randomization occurred at the family level.
In our baseline specifications, we include randomization site dummies s (since randomization
occurred within sites) but no additional covariates X, as the choice of which covariates to include is
somewhat arbitrary. In supplemental specifications, we evaluate the sensitivity of our estimates to
the inclusion of the 52 baseline covariates shown in Appendix Table 1a. Including these additional
covariates affects the point estimates modestly and has little impact on the qualitative conclusions,
as expected given that the covariates are balanced across the treatment groups.14

move through MTO. Since not all the families offered vouchers actually took them up, these ITT
estimates understate the causal effect of actually moving to a different neighborhood. Following
Kling et al. (2007), we estimate the impacts of moving through MTO – the impact of “treatment
on the treated” (TOT) – by instrumenting for MTO voucher takeup with the treatment assignment
indicators. Formally, we estimate specifications of the form

Replicating the covariate balance tests discussed in Section II.C on the estimation sub-samples (e.g., the subset
of children for whom we observe earnings at age 24) yields very similar results to those reported in Appendix Table
1a.

where TakeExp and TakeS8 are indicators for taking up the experimental and Section 8 vouchers,
respectively. Since TakeExp and TakeS8 are endogenous variables, we instrument for them using
the randomly-assigned MTO treatment group indicators (Exp and S8) and estimate (2) using twostage least squares. Under the assumption that MTO voucher offers only affect outcomes through

This section reports estimates of (1) and (2) for various outcomes yi . We begin by analyzing
the “first-stage” effects of the MTO experiment on the characteristics of the neighborhoods where
children grew up. We then turn to impacts on children’s outcomes in adulthood, such as earnings
and college attendance rates.

III. A. Voucher Takeup and Neighborhood Characteristics during Childhood
Table 2 shows the effects of the MTO treatments on voucher takeup rates and poverty rates in
the neighborhoods where children were raised. Panel A considers younger children (below 13 at
RA), while Panel B considers older children (between ages 13-18 at RA). The estimates in Table
2 include no controls other that randomization site indicators; Appendix Table 2 replicates Table
2 controlling for the baseline covariates listed in Appendix Table 1a and shows that the estimates
are similar.
Column 1 of Table 2 reports estimates of the specification in (1) with an indicator for taking
up a housing voucher as the dependent variable yi . The control group mean is 0 for this outcome
because those in the control group were not offered vouchers. Among younger children, 48% who
were assigned to the experimental group took up the voucher they were offered. 66% of those in
the Section 8 group took up the less restrictive voucher that they were offered. The corresponding
takeup (or “compliance”) rates were slightly lower among families with older children, at 40% and
55%. Families in the treatment groups who chose to take up the vouchers were also more likely to
have been dissatisfied with their current apartment and indicate they would be very likely to be
able to find a new apartment (Kling et al. 2007).16
15

The ITT estimates rely only on the assumption of random assignment, which is guaranteed by the experimental
design. The TOT estimates rely on the additional (untestable) assumption that being offered an MTO voucher had
no effect on those who did not take it up.
16
One might be concerned that when MTO household heads (parents) moved, their children may have stayed
behind in the old neighborhood with relatives or friends. In practice, virtually all children moved along with their
parents. Approximately 95% of both younger and older children were still living with their parents one year after RA
in the control group. The fraction living with their parents is, if anything, slightly higher in the treatment groups

13

Families who took up the MTO housing vouchers moved to a variety of different neighborhoods.
Appendix Table 1c lists the most common destinations in each of the five sites. For example, many
MTO participants in New York were living in the Martin Luther King (MLK) Towers, a housing
development in Harlem, at the point of RA. Many families who took up experimental vouchers
moved to Wakefield in the North Bronx (near the Westchester County border), about 10 miles
north of the MLK Towers. Several families who took up Section 8 vouchers moved to Soundview
in the Central Bronx, about 6 miles north of the MLK Towers.
We characterize the neighborhoods to which MTO families moved more systematically by measuring the impacts of the MTO treatments on neighborhood poverty rates. Column 2 reports
ITT estimates of impacts on poverty rates in the census tract where the child lived one year after
random assignment using the specification in (1). The mean control group family was living in a
very distressed census tract one year after RA, with a 50% poverty rate – 2.92 standard deviations
(SD) above the national average in the 2000 census national tract-poverty distribution. The MTO
treatments led to large reductions in neighborhood poverty for both younger and older children.
For younger children, the MTO voucher offers reduced the census-tract poverty rates in the experimental and Section 8 groups by 17 and 15 percentage points (pp). The ITT estimates of reductions
in poverty rates are slightly smaller for the older children, at 14 and 12 pp respectively. This is
because the voucher takeup rate was slightly lower among families with older children, as shown in
Column 1.
Column 3 of Table 2 reports TOT estimates on poverty rates – i.e., the change in poverty rates
for families that actually took up the voucher – using the specification in (2). The estimates in this
column are essentially the ITT estimates reported in Column 2 divided by the impacts on voucher
takeup reported in Column 1, which is the first stage of the 2SLS regression used to estimate (2).17
Among younger children, those who moved using the experimental voucher live in neighborhoods
with a 36 pp lower poverty rate than those in the control group one year after random assignment.
Those who moved with the Section 8 voucher live in neighborhoods with a 23 pp lower poverty
rate. The TOT impacts are very similar for older children.
We focus on the effects of the MTO treatments on poverty rates because the experimental
vouchers were targeted based on poverty rates and poverty rates are the most common measure of
neighborhood quality in the literature on neighborhood effects (Sampson et al. 2002). Prior MTO
one year post-RA.
17
The correspondence is not exact because the sample used in Column 1 differs slightly from that in Column 3, as
post-RA locations are not available for all families.

14

research (Kling et al. 2007, Ludwig et al. 2012) has shown that the mean neighborhood poverty rate
experienced post-RA provides a reliable linear summary index of neighborhood quality (treatment
dosage) for explaining variation in MTO treatment impacts by site and treatment group for both
MTO adults and children. However, it is important to note that the MTO treatments changed
neighborhood characteristics in several other dimensions as well. The MTO treatment groups lived
in neighborhoods with more-educated residents and a lower share of single parent households. MTO
treatment group households – especially those in the experimental group – experienced large and
persistent increases in neighborhood safety, neighborhood satisfaction, and housing quality relative
to control group families (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011). The MTO treatments also modestly improved
post-random assignment school quality, but these improvements were substantially smaller than the
improvements in residential neighborhood quality (Fryer and Katz 2013). The MTO treatments
had more modest impacts in reducing neighborhood racial segregation (percent minority) than
neighborhood economic segregation (Ludwig et al. 2013). The treatment effects we report in this
paper should thus be interpreted as the effect of changing a bundle of neighborhood attributes
rather than any one feature of neighborhood environments.18
The effects of the MTO treatments on neighborhood conditions attenuate over time because
many control families moved out of high-poverty public housing projects and some families in
the MTO treatment groups moved back to higher-poverty areas. Nevertheless, children in the
treatment groups experienced substantially different neighborhood environments on average during
their childhood. Column 4 of Table 2 shows that on average from the point of RA until age
18, children in the experimental voucher group lived in areas with approximately 10 pp lower
poverty rates than those in the control group. Children in the Section 8 group lived in areas with
approximately 8 pp lower poverty rates than those in the control group. The corresponding TOT
effects, shown in Column 5, are a 22-25 pp reduction in mean poverty rates for those who took
up the experimental voucher and a 12-15 pp reduction in mean poverty rates for those who took
up the Section 8 voucher. Thus, the impacts of MTO-induced moves on the average neighborhood
poverty experienced during childhood are about twice as large for the experimental group as for
the Section 8 group.
Columns 6 and 7 of Table 2 show ITT and TOT impacts on mean ZIP-code level poverty rates
18

Because all of these neighborhood characteristics are highly correlated with each other, it is difficult to disentangle
which attributes of neighborhoods are most predictive of children’s success in the MTO data. The quasi-experimental
estimates of neighborhood effects reported in Chetty and Hendren (2015) are better suited to studying this question
because they are more precise and cover all areas of the United States.

15

from RA until age 18 (rather than tract-level poverty rates). The impacts on ZIP-code poverty are
about half as large as impacts on census-tract poverty because ZIP codes provide a more aggregated
measure of neighborhoods than census tracts. These ZIP code measures are a useful benchmark
because we can construct analogous ZIP-code level measures (but not tract-level measures) in the
tax data to analyze the effects of the MTO treatments on where children live in adulthood.
The key implication of Table 2 for our analysis of exposure effects is that the younger MTO
children received a much larger dosage of exposure to improved neighborhood environments than
the older MTO children. The TOT effects on post-RA neighborhood poverty rates are similar for
the younger and older MTO children. That is, families who took up vouchers moved to similar
neighborhoods irrespective of their children’s age. However, the younger children got the improvements in neighborhoods starting at younger ages. On average the younger group got 9.8 years
of childhood exposure to better neighborhoods up to age 18, because they were 8.2 years old on
average at RA. In contrast, those in the older group received only 2.9 years of childhood exposure
to better neighborhoods on average, because they were 15.1 years old on average at RA. Our next
task is to examine how this exposure to different neighborhood environments affected the long-run
economic, educational, and family outcomes of the MTO children.

III. B. Income in Adulthood
Table 3 presents estimates of MTO treatment effects on children’s income and employment rates
in adulthood. As in Table 2, we divide children into two groups: younger children (less than 13
years at RA) and older children (13 to 18 years at RA).
We begin in Column 1 of Table 3 by estimating ITT effects of the MTO treatments on annual
W-2 wage earnings between 2008-12. This regression is estimated with one observation per year
per child and includes no controls other than randomization site indicators. To avoid measuring
earnings when children are still in college, we only include observations in which a child is 24 or
older. The standard errors, which are clustered by family, adjust for the repeated observations for
each child.19
For children below age 13 at RA, mean W-2 earnings in the control group is $9,549. Children
assigned to the experimental voucher group have annual W-2 earnings that are $1,340 (14%) higher
on average than those in the control group. This estimate is significantly different from 0 with
p < 0.05. The estimated ITT effect of the Section 8 voucher is about half as large as the ITT
19
In our baseline analysis, we do not trim the income measures. Top-coding income at $100,000 yields similar
estimates of mean treatment effects (Appendix Table 3c, Columns 9 and 10).

16

effect of the experimental voucher. For children aged 13-18 at RA, the estimated effects of both the
experimental and Section 8 vouchers are negative, although they are not statistically significant.
W-2 earnings do not include self-employment income, tips, or earnings from jobs that paid less
than $1,800 a year, all of which may be important income sources for individuals in the MTO
sample. We therefore turn in Column 2 to a broader measure, which we call “individual earnings,”
that sums W-2 earnings and non-W-2 earnings using data from 1040 tax forms (see Section II.B
for further details). For younger children, the ITT effect of the experimental voucher on individual
earnings is $1,624 – again a 14% increase relative to the control group mean, which is $11,270. The
ITT effect of the Section 8 voucher is $1,109 and is marginally significant, with p = 0.101. Once
again, the estimated effects on the older children are negative but statistically insignificant.
The larger treatment effects on individual earnings than on W-2 earnings could potentially be
driven by endogenous tax filing responses, as non-W-2 earnings are observed only for individuals
who file tax returns.20 We do find that the experimental voucher treatment increased federal tax
filing rates 5.7 pp for younger children (see Table 12 below). However, mean non-W-2 earnings for
tax filers in the control group – which is a plausible upper bound for non-filers – is only $1,721.
Hence, the 5.7 pp filing increase accounts for at most 0.057 × $1, 721 = $98 of the increase in nonW-2 earnings for younger children, a small portion of the observed increase in non-W-2 earnings
of $284 (Appendix Table 3c, Column 2). Hence, the majority of the increase in non-W-2 earnings
appears to be driven by real changes in earnings behavior, consistent with the fact that both nonW-2 and W-2 earnings rise by 14% in the experimental voucher group relative to the control group.
We therefore use the broader “individual earnings” measure as our preferred measure of earnings
in what follows.
Column 3 of Table 2 replicates the specification in Column 2 including the baseline covariates
used in the MTO final impacts evaluation (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011), listed in Appendix Table
1a. For younger children, the inclusion of these covariates reduces the point estimates by about
20%, approximately one-third to one-half of a standard error of the baseline estimates.21 If one
includes different subsets of the covariates, one can obtain point estimates that are slightly larger
or smaller than the baseline estimates without controls. Importantly, the estimated coefficients
generally fluctuate by less than half a standard error when we include different sets of covariates
20

In contrast, W-2 earnings are observed for all individuals, irrespective of whether they file tax returns or not.
Hence, the estimate in Column 1 of Table 3 is unaffected by concerns about endogenous reporting.
21
The changes in the coefficients are due to differences in the characteristics of the treatment and control groups
that arise from sampling error. For example, the drop in the experimental treatment effect is driven primarily by the
fact that the experimental group has slightly more educated parents (Appendix Table 1a).

17

and thus are not statistically significant from each other, consistent with random assignment and
balance across the treatment arms.
For completeness, we report estimates with the full set of baseline controls for all the other
specifications in Table 3 in Appendix Table 3a. The inclusion of controls tends to yield slightly
smaller estimated MTO treatment effects relative to the specifications without controls, but the
differences are not statistically indistinguishable from each other and do not alter the qualitative
conclusions. In particular, the experimental voucher treatment has a large, statistically significant
positive effect on earnings of younger children, the Section 8 voucher has smaller positive, marginally
significant effects on younger children, and the effects of both treatments on older children are
negative and statistically insignificant.22 We also consistently find significant treatment effects
(p < 0.05) for the younger children, both with and without controls, when we pool the Section 8
and experimental groups into a single treatment group (Appendix Table 11, Columns 7-8).
Column 4 of Table 3 reports TOT estimates on individual earnings using the specification in
(2). These TOT estimates correspond to the ITT estimates reported in Column 2; we report TOT
estimates corresponding to all the other ITT specifications in Table 3 in Appendix Table 3b. The
estimates in Column 4 show that children whose families took up the experimental voucher and
moved when they were young (below age 13, age 8.2 on average) experience an increase in annual
individual earnings in early adulthood of $3,477. This is a 31% increase relative to the control
group mean earnings of $11,270 and a 34% increase relative to the “control complier mean” (CCM)
of $10,165 (Appendix Table 3b, Column 4).23
Section 8 moves lead to a TOT increase in individual earnings of $1,723 per year (15% of the
control group mean and 16% of the Section 8 CCM) for younger children. The Section 8 TOT
effect on earnings is roughly half as large as the TOT effect of the experimental voucher. This
mirrors the fact that the Section 8 TOT effect of -12 pp on mean tract-level poverty rates from RA
until age 18 was also roughly half as large as the experimental voucher TOT effect of -22 pp on
poverty rates (Table 2, Column 5). Dividing the TOT effects on earnings by the TOT effects on
poverty rates, we infer that growing up in a census tract with a 10 pp lower poverty rate starting
22

For a few outcomes, such as W-2 earnings, the inclusion of controls attenuates the estimates to the point where
the estimates are no longer significant with p < 0.05. For example, Column 1 of Appendix Table 3a shows the ITT
impact on W-2 earnings for the younger children in the Experimental group is $1,016.8 with a standard error of $640
(p = 0.11). However, the point estimate of $1,016.8 is not statistically distinguishable from the baseline estimate
without controls ($1,339.8).
23
The CCM is an estimate of mean earnings for those in the control group who would have taken up the experimental
voucher had they been assigned to the experimental group. The experimental CCM is calculated as mean earnings
among compliers (i.e., those who took up the voucher) in the experimental group minus the TOT estimate of the
experimental treatment effect, as in Kling et al. (2007).

18

at a young age (age 8.2 on average) increases earnings in adulthood by about 13-15%.
The TOT estimates for older children are around -$2,000 for both treatments but are not
statistically distinguishable from 0. However, we can reject the hypothesis that the effects of the
experimental voucher for the older children are the same as those for the younger children with
p = 0.02 (see Section IV.C).
In our baseline specifications, we measure earnings for younger children at an earlier age than
for older children. In Column 5, we replicate the specification in Column 2 measuring earnings at
age 26 for all children.24 This specification yields roughly similar estimates, showing that the age
differences are not responsible for the larger effects observed for younger children. In Column 6, we
measure earnings using data from the most recent available year (2012) for all children to evaluate
whether differences in the calendar year when income is measured affect the results. Again, this
specification yields similar estimates, with significant gains for younger children and negative point
estimates for the older children.
In Column 7, we estimate the ITT effects of the MTO treatments on employment rates. This
specification replicates Column 2 using an indicator for having any W-2 earnings in a calendar
year as the dependent variable. MTO treatments have small, statistically insignificant impacts on
the extensive margin of employment. The ITT for employment of the young experimental children
is 1.8 pp, a 3% increase relative to the control group mean of 61.8%. Thus, MTO’s impacts on
increasing earnings for younger children appear to be driven primary by higher wage rates and/or
greater hours worked in a year rather than by changes in whether or not individuals work at all
over the course of a year.
Household Income. In Column 8, we estimate ITT effects on household income. Household
income expands upon our individual earnings measure by including spouse’s income (for married
tax filers), unemployment insurance income, and social security and disability (SSDI) income (see
Section II.B for details). For younger children, the experimental ITT effect on household income is
$2,231, $607 larger than the ITT on individual earnings reported in Column 2. The experimental
ITT on household income is significantly different from 0 with p < 0.01. The Section 8 ITT effect
on household income is $1,452 and is significantly different from 0 with p < 0.05. The effects of the
treatments on the household income of older children remain negative and statistically insignificant.
We investigate why the MTO treatments have larger effects on household income than on
24
Earnings comparisons at age 26 limit the sample of younger MTO children to those who were 8 to 12 years old
at RA with a mean of 10.7 years as compared to a mean age at RA for the older MTO children of 15.1 years.

19

individual earnings for younger children in Appendix Table 3c, which shows ITT effects on the
components of income that contribute to household income. The additional $607 impact of the
experimental voucher on household income relative to individual earnings is predominantly driven
by spousal income, which is $521 higher in the experimental group for younger children.25 This
increase in spousal income can be entirely accounted for by the effect of the experimental voucher
treatment on marriage rates (rather than an increase in a given spouse’s level of earnings), as
we show in Table 5 below.26 The experimental voucher treatment also increases unemployment
benefits by $167 per year, possibly because higher labor force participation rates increase eligibility
for unemployment benefits. It reduces social security and disability benefits by $98 per year,
consistent with increases in labor supply and earnings.
Earnings Trajectories. Earnings rise steeply in the mid-late 20’s as children complete education
and enter the labor force (Haider and Solon 2006). Thus, one might expect the treatment effects
of MTO to grow as we measure children’s earnings at later ages. Figure 1 plots estimates of the
ITT effect of the experimental voucher treatment on individual earnings, varying the age at which
earnings are measured from 20 to 28. These effects are estimated using specifications analogous to
that in Column 5 of Table 3. The MTO experimental impact does in fact rise sharply with age of
income measurement for the younger children. The null hypothesis that the experimental impacts
do not vary with the age at which income is measured is rejected with p < 0.01.27 In contrast, the
treatment effects fall significantly with the age at which income is measured for the older children,
implying that they not only have lower earnings but also have less earnings growth in their early
career relative to those in the control group. A similar pattern of rising treatment effects with age of
income measurement for younger children and declining effects with age of income measurement for
older children is observed for the Section 8 group, although the estimates are noisier and attenuated
(Appendix Figure 1).
25

Part of the observed effect on spousal income could be driven by endogenous tax filing, as spousal income is only
observed for individuals who file tax returns. However, calculations analogous to those above imply that at most
0.057 × $802.1 = $46 of the $521 experimental impact on spousal income can be accounted for by a filing response,
assuming that the mean spousal income of married non-filers is no larger than the mean spousal income of $802 for
tax filers in the control group.
26
For younger children, the experimental voucher increases the fraction married by 1.9 percentage points (Table 5,
Column 1). The mean individual income of spouses in the control group for married individuals is $25,568. If the
marginal individuals marry individuals with average income, we would predict an increase in household income of
0.019 × $25, 568 = $486, similar to the observed increase of $521.
27
To estimate this p-value, we regress earnings on the treatment group indicators linearly interacted with the age
of income measurement, controlling for age of income measurement fixed effects interacted with site fixed effects. The
p-value is based on the coefficient for the interaction of age at income measurement with the experimental treatment
indicator. We estimate this regression in a dataset with one observation per age of income measurement per child
and cluster standard errors by family.

20

Column 9 quantifies the effects of the MTO treatment on earnings growth over a five-year
period. The dependent variable in this specification is the difference in individual earnings in year
t minus year t − 5; as in the other specifications in Table 3, we restrict the sample to observations
in which the individual is 24 or older in year t. In the control group, the mean level of income
growth over five years is $4,002 for younger children. The ITT effect of the experimental voucher
on five-year income growth is $1,309 (a 33% increase), while the ITT effect of the Section 8 voucher
is $800 (a 20% increase). These results suggest that our baseline estimates, which measure income
starting at age 24, likely understate the total lifetime earnings impacts of the MTO experimental
voucher on children who were young at the point of the move.
Summary. In sum, our analysis of children’s income in adulthood yields three robust findings.
First, the MTO experimental voucher treatment substantially increased the earnings of children
who were young (below age 13) at the point of the move, with a TOT impact on individual
earnings of approximately 35%. Second, the Section 8 voucher increased individual earnings of
young children about half as much as the experimental voucher, consistent with the fact that it
reduced neighborhood poverty rates half as much. Third, the impacts of both treatments on older
children are somewhat negative (although not statistically significant).
These three facts are consistent with a simple model that combines positive exposure effects
from moving to lower-poverty neighborhoods with a negative disruption cost of moving to such
a neighborhood. Such a model would generate our empirical results because the exposure effects
outweigh the disruption cost for children who move when young, but not for children who move at
older ages. Note that because families in both the control and treatment groups moved frequently,
the disruption cost must reflect the cost of moving to a different type of neighborhood (as induced
by the MTO voucher treatments, especially the experimental voucher) rather than a fixed cost
of moving houses within the same neighborhood or a similar nearby neighborhood (as typically
occurred in the control group).

III. C. College Attendance and Quality
In Table 4, we examine MTO impacts on college attendance rates and college quality. Table 4 and
the subsequent tables are structured in the same way as Table 3: Panel A reports estimates for
younger children (below age 13 at RA), while Panel B reports estimates for older children (ages
13-18 at RA). We report ITT estimates using the specification in (1), with no additional controls
other than randomization site indicators. For this and all subsequent outcomes, the corresponding

21

Appendix Tables with the same number provide ITT estimates with the full set of controls and
TOT estimates corresponding to the specifications in the main table.
We begin in Column 1 by analyzing treatment effects on college attendance rates between the
ages of 18-20. College attendance is measured using 1098-T forms as discussed in Section II.B.
This regression includes one observation per child at age 18, 19, and 20; the standard errors, which
are clustered by family, adjust for the repeated observations for each child. For younger children
(Panel A), the mean college attendance rate between the ages of 18-20 in the control group is
16.5%. Children assigned to the experimental voucher group are 2.5 percentage points (pp) more
likely to attend college between the ages of 18-20. The corresponding TOT effect for children whose
families took up the experimental voucher is a 5.2 pp increase in college attendance rates, a 32%
increase relative to the control group mean and a 34% increase relative to the control complier
mean (Appendix Table 4b, Column 1).
The Section 8 voucher also has a positive ITT effect of 1 pp, but it is not statistically significant.
In contrast, for the older children, both MTO treatments have large and statistically significant
negative effects. The experimental ITT is -4.3 pp, while the Section 8 ITT is -3 pp. These findings
mirror the patterns observed for earnings, although the negative impacts on college attendance for
older children are larger than on earnings.
Columns 2-5 present estimates of impacts on college attendance rates by age, from age 18 to
21. The MTO experimental treatment increased college going for younger children in the period
immediately following high school, but had little effect beyond age 20. For younger children, the
experimental ITT effects are approximately 2.5 pp from ages 18-20, but fall to 0.4 pp at age 21.
The Section 8 ITT estimates exhibit a similar pattern, with positive effects of around 1 pp from
ages 18-20 and a small negative estimated effect at age 21.28 Meanwhile, the ITT effects on older
children are consistently negative at all ages for both treatments.
Next, we investigate whether the MTO treatments also changed the types of colleges that
students attended. To do so, we use a simple earnings-based index of college “quality,” defined as
the mean earnings at age 31 of all U.S. residents enrolled in a given college at age 20 (see Section
II.D for details). For those not enrolled in any college at age 20, the index equals the mean earnings
at age 31 of all U.S. residents not enrolled in college at age 20. We define college quality at age a
28

We find small, statistically insignificant estimates on college attendance at older ages (up to age 25), similar to
those at age 21. Thus, the positive MTO experimental treatment effect on college attendance for younger children
from ages 18 to 20 does not appear to be driven purely by retiming of college attendance. However, our sample size
declines when looking at older ages, so we cannot rule out some degree of retiming.

22

for each child in the MTO sample based on the college in which the child was enrolled at age a.
Column 6 of Table 4 replicates the specification in Column 1 using college quality, measured
between the ages of 18-20, as the dependent variable. For younger children, the experimental
voucher increases mean college quality between the ages of 18-20 by $687 – that is, expected earnings
at age 31 are $687 higher for the experimental voucher group relative to the control group given the
colleges that children attend.29 This estimate is significantly different from 0 with p < 0.01. This
increase of $687 reflects a combination of extensive-margin responses (higher college attendance
rates) and intensive-margin responses (attending a better college conditional on attending). We
derive an upper bound on the extensive margin effect by assuming that those who are induced to
attend college attend a college of average quality, which is a plausible upper bound for the quality
of the college attended by the marginal college student. The mean college quality conditional on
attending college for younger children in the control group is $31,409, while the quality for all those
who do not attend college is $18,867. This suggests that at most (31, 409 − 18, 867) × 0.025 = $314
of the $687 impact is due to the extensive margin response. Hence, the MTO experimental voucher
appears to improve not just college attendance rates but also the quality of colleges that students
attend.30
The Section 8 voucher also has a large positive effect on college quality for younger children
that is significant with p < 0.05. The estimated effects on college quality for older children are
negative and substantial in magnitude. The difference between the positive MTO experimental
impact on college quality for younger children and the large negative effect for older children is
highly statistically significant (p = 0.0006), as shown in Table 11 below. The treatment impacts on
college quality by age, shown in Column 7-10 of Table 4, are similar to those for college attendance
rates. The effects are larger between ages 18-20 and become smaller at age 21, suggesting that
most of the marginal children induced to attend college do so immediately after high school.
Overall, the positive MTO treatment impacts on college outcomes for younger children and
negative impacts for older children closely mirror the impacts on earnings in Table 3. These results
further support the view that moving to lower-poverty areas improve outcomes when one moves as
29

The increase in actual individual earnings of $1,624 (Table 3, Column 2) is larger than the $686 impact on
projected earnings at age 31 based on college attendance. This indicates that the MTO treatment effects on earnings
go beyond what one would expect just from the labor market returns to increased college attainment. This is to
be expected given the fact that even in the experimental voucher group, more than 80% of children do not attend
college.
30
The point estimates of the treatment effects on college attendance and quality are slightly smaller when we
include controls (Appendix Table 4a). With controls, we estimate that the experimental treatment increased college
attendance rates by 1.7 pp from ages 18-20 (as compared to 2.5 pp without controls) and increased college quality
by $536.2 (as compared to $687 without controls).

a young child but not at older ages.

III. D. Marriage and Fertility
We next examine MTO treatment impacts on children’s marriage and fertility outcomes in Table 5.
Columns 1-3 present ITT effects of the MTO treatments on marriage rates, based on whether the
individual files a tax return jointly with a spouse. We include one observation per child per year
from 2008-12, limiting the sample to observations where children are 24 or older. In Column 1, we
pool males and females. For younger children, the experimental treatment increased the fraction
married in early adulthood by 1.9 pp, while the Section 8 treatment increases the fraction married
by 2.8 pp. These changes are quite large relative to the fraction married in the control group, which
is only 3.4%.31 The MTO treatment effects for the younger children are substantially larger for
females, for whom the marriage rate nearly doubles, than for males, for whom the effects are small
and not statistically significant (Columns 2 and 3). There are no detectable treatment effects on
marriage for the older children.
In Columns 4-7, we study the fertility behavior of the female children in the MTO sample,
which we infer from applications from social security numbers for children (see Section II.B). These
specifications include one observation for each female child because the outcomes are time-invariant.
Columns 4 and 5 show that the MTO treatments do not have statistically significant effects on
overall birth rates or teenage birth rates for either the younger or older female children. However,
the experimental voucher treatment does change the family circumstances of births substantially,
in particular the presence of the father at the birth. We measure whether the father is present
at the child’s birth by whether his name and SSN are listed on the child’s social security number
application (which is typically submitted when the child is born). In Column 6, we restrict the
sample to females who have a birth and use an indicator for having a father listed on the firstborn child’s SSN application as the dependent variable. We find that the experimental voucher
treatment increases the share of births in which the father is present by 6.8 pp for younger children.
This leads to a significant decline of 4.8 pp in the fraction of females who have a birth with no
31

Because we only observe marital status for those who file tax returns, part of the observed response could be due
to the increase in tax filing rates that we document in Table 8 below, but this bias is likely to be very small. The
experimental voucher treatment increased federal tax filing rates 5.7 percentage points for younger children. If the
marginal filer had the same probability of being married as individuals in the control group (3.4%), then endogenous
filing accounts for at most 0.057 × 0.034 = 0.2 percentage points of the 1.9 pp increase in marriage rates that we
observe. The more plausible explanation is that the increase in marriage rates induced by the treatments led to the
increase in tax filing rates documented in Table 8, as virtually all married working-age couples file tax returns (Cilke
1998).

24

father present, as shown in Column 7.32 The TOT effect corresponding to this estimate is -10.0 pp,
implying that girls whose families moved using the experimental voucher when they were young
are 26% less likely to become single mothers (Appendix Table 5b, Column 7).
As with other outcomes, the Section 8 voucher has smaller effects on the father’s presence at
birth than the experimental voucher. And the older female children in the MTO experimental group
are much less likely to have a father listed on the birth certificate when they have births relative to
the control group. Hence, marriage and fertility behavior exhibit what is now a familiar pattern of
effects, with significant increases in marriage rates and reductions in single parenthood for children
who moved to lower-poverty neighborhoods when young, but no change or opposite-signed effects
for children who made the same moves at an older age.

III. E. Neighborhood Characteristics in Adulthood
The MTO vouchers substantially reduced the degree of neighborhood poverty experienced by MTO
children during their childhood (Table 2). Do these childhood improvements in neighborhood
environments persist into adulthood, providing better neighborhoods for the next generation (the
children of MTO children)? In Table 6, we answer this question using information drawn from tax
records on the ZIP codes where MTO children live in adulthood.33
Among younger children (Panel A), both the experimental and Section 8 children live in better
neighborhoods in adulthood relative to the control group children on a wide range of measures.
In Column 1, we measure ITT effects on ZIP-code level poverty rates, with one observation per
child per year from 2008-12 (only including observations where children are age 24 or older). The
experimental ITT estimate is -1.6 percentage points, about one-third as large as the treatment
effect on the average poverty rate in the ZIP code where the individual lived in childhood (Table
2, Column 6). Columns 2-4 examine impacts on other neighborhood characteristics using the same
specification as in Column 1. They show that children assigned to the experimental group also live
in areas with higher mean income, less racial segregation (lower share of black residents), and a
lower share of female-headed households. All of these treatment effects are significantly different
from 0 with p < 0.01. In contrast, the MTO treatments on adult neighborhood quality are smaller
and typically not statistically significant for the older MTO children, as seen in Panel B of Table 6.
32

Unlike Column 6, where we focus on the endogenously selected sample of girls who have births, the specification
in Column 7 is estimated on the full sample of all young girls in the MTO data, using an indicator for having a birth
with no father present as the dependent variable.
33
We are unable to obtain ZIP codes for 20.4% of the children because we do not have tax returns or W-2 forms
for them. The rate of missing ZIP code data does not vary across the treatment and control groups.

25

Together, Tables 5 and 6 indicate that the improvements in neighborhood environments for
the younger MTO children lead to better neighborhood and family environments for the next
generation, the grandchildren of the original MTO parents. Relative to the grandchildren in the
control group, the grandchildren in the experimental group are more likely to be raised in lowerpoverty neighborhoods by two parents who have a higher level of household income and are more
likely to have attended college. In short, subsidized housing vouchers produce durable benefits
that persist into subsequent generations for children who moved to lower-poverty neighborhoods at
young ages.

III. F. Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects
Prior work has found that the MTO treatments had more positive effects on female children than on
male children in terms of mental health, physical health, risky behaviors, and educational outcomes
during adolescence (Kling et al. 2007, Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011, Ludwig et al. 2013). In Table 7,
we re-examine the heterogeneity of MTO treatment effects by child gender, but look at outcomes
in adulthood.
In contrast to the substantially more favorable MTO treatment impacts for female than male
children when they were teenagers, we find roughly similar impacts by gender when observing the
MTO children as adults. Table 7 shows ITT estimates by gender for individual earnings, college
quality, and ZIP-code level poverty rates in adulthood. Columns 1 and 2 show experimental ITT
estimates by gender, while columns 3 and 4 show Section 8 ITT estimates by gender. We show
the mean value of the dependent variable for the control group in the relevant estimation sample
in square brackets to facilitate interpretation of magnitudes.34
For younger children (Panel A), the experimental ITT effect on individual earnings in adulthood
(age 24 and above) for boys is $1,679, an estimate that is significantly different from 0 with p =
0.085. The comparable estimate for girls is a very similar $1,439 (p = 0.104). The Section 8 ITT
effects are slightly smaller for both boys and girls, at approximately $1,100. The experimental and
Section 8 treatments also improve college quality (at ages 18-20) and neighborhood quality (at age
24 and above) for both boys and girls. Conversely, we find adverse long-term treatment effects for
both boys and girls who were above age 13 at RA (Panel B).
The positive effects of the MTO treatments on adult outcomes for the younger boys point
34

An interesting feature of the data presented in Table 7 is that female MTO children have substantially higher
adult earnings on average than male MTO children for both the younger and older groups – a striking reversal of the
usual gender earnings gap favoring men. The difference arises from much higher employment rates for female than
male MTO children, likely reflecting changes in labor market outcomes by gender in U.S. disadvantaged populations.

26

to an intriguing dynamic pattern of neighborhood effects when combined with results from prior
work. Previous work found positive initial impacts of MTO moves on young boys (at 1 to 3.5
years after random assignment), who had a significantly lower incidence of problem behaviors
(Katz et al. 2001). But boys who moved to lower-poverty areas at young ages in the experimental
group were doing moderately worse than those in the control group as teens in terms of risky
behaviors and education (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011). This pattern has now turned around to
a strongly positive one in terms of labor market and educational outcomes in early adulthood.
One speculative explanation for these patterns is that teenage misdeeds may have smaller adverse
consequences and second chances may be more available for youth in middle-class neighborhoods
than in more-distressed neighborhoods. The positive MTO experimental impacts in adulthood for
the younger female youth are less surprising, as previous work found significant positive impacts
for the younger females in the experimental group both as teens in the interim evaluation and
continued modestly positive effects as older teens in the final evaluation.
We also explored heterogeneity of the MTO treatment effects by race and ethnicity (Appendix
Table 7a) and across the five randomization sites (Appendix Table 7b). The MTO experimental
voucher increased individual earnings in adulthood and college quality for children below age at 13
at RA in every racial group (Black, Hispanic, and White) and in all five sites (Baltimore, Boston,
Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles).35 The treatment effects on earnings and college quality are
larger in the sites where the treatments led to larger reductions in neighborhood poverty rates. In
contrast, the estimated effects for the older children (ages 13-18 at RA) are negative in virtually
all the subgroups for each of the outcomes.
In summary, the main lesson of the heterogeneity analysis is that the long-term benefits of
childhood exposure to lower-poverty neighborhoods are highly robust across genders, racial groups,
and geographic locations.

III. G. Age Pattern of Exposure Effects
Thus far, we have split the MTO children into “younger” vs. “older” children using a cutoff of age
13 at RA. In this section, we assess the sensitivity of our results to the choice of this cutoff and
evaluate how the effects of the MTO treatments vary with a child’s age at move more generally.
As a first step, we replicate the baseline specifications in Tables 3-6, varying the cutoff used to
split the sample. We find very similar estimates if we define “young” children as those below age
35
Note that the subgroup-specific estimates are naturally much less precise because of the smaller sample sizes,
and hence are not statistically significant in many cases.

27

12 at RA or those below age 14 at RA (Appendix Table 11). In particular, the estimated effects
of the experimental voucher on individual earnings, college quality, neighborhood poverty share,
and fraction married are all significantly different from 0 at conventional significance levels, with
point estimates similar to the baseline estimates. The Section 8 voucher also has positive effects in
all cases, most of which are smaller than the experimental voucher impacts but still significantly
different from 0.
Linear Exposure Models. A different way to assess how the MTO treatment effects vary with
children’s age at move is to estimate models that interact age at move linearly with the treatment
indicators instead of splitting children into two groups. Pooling all children, we regress outcomes
(y) on the MTO treatment group indicators (Exp and S8) and interactions of these treatment group
indicators with the age at random assignment (AgeRA):

yi = α + βE0 Expi + βS0 S8i + βEA Expi · AgeRAi + βSA S8 · AgeRAi + si γ + i ,

(3)

controlling for randomization site indicators (si ). The coefficients on the main effects for treatment
group assignment (βE0 and βS0 ) can be interpreted as the ITT impact of being offered a voucher to
move to a better neighborhood at birth. The coefficients on the interaction terms with age at RA
(βEA and βSA ) can be interpreted as the average reduction in the ITT effects per year of reduced
exposure to the new area. Note that we observe college outcomes only for children who were 4 or
older at RA and earnings only for those who were 6 or older at RA. Hence, the estimates of impacts
at birth rely on out-of-sample extrapolations based on the linear functional form.
Table 8 presents estimates of (3) for individual earnings (Column 1), household income (Columns
2 and 3), college quality (Column 4), marriage rates (Column 5) and the ZIP-code poverty share in
adulthood (Column 6). Column 7 reports effects on total taxes paid – an outcome that we return
to in Section V below. Appendix Table 8a replicates the ITT estimates in Table 8 including the
baseline controls. Appendix Table 8b presents TOT estimates, estimated using a 2SLS specification where we instrument for voucher takeup (and the interactions) using treatment assignment
indicators.
The estimates in Table 8 indicate large and statistically significant beneficial impacts of the
experimental treatment for all the outcomes, with the gains declining rapidly with age at RA. In
other words, the benefits of being offered an MTO experimental voucher increase with potential
years of childhood exposure to better neighborhoods. For example, the experimental ITT estimates
for individual earnings in Column 1 imply an increase in annual adult earnings of βE0 = $4, 823
28

for those offered an experimental voucher at birth. The estimated effect on earnings falls by
βEA = −$364 per year, so the predicted effect reaches zero for children who are 13.25 years at RA
and becomes negative for children who move as teenagers. This pattern is consistent with positive
childhood exposure effects on earnings coupled with a disruption cost of moving to a very different
social environment (e.g., moving from a high-poverty to a low-poverty neighborhood or moving a
substantial geographic distance) that outweighs the exposure benefits if children move after age 13.
The Section 8 voucher has a similar pattern of effects with attenuated magnitudes. The TOT
estimates of both the treatment effects at birth and the interactions with age at RA are about
half as large for the Section 8 group as for the experimental group for most outcomes (Appendix
Table 8b). This mirrors the fact that the Section 8 treatment reduced neighborhood poverty rates
in childhood half as much as the experimental treatment (Table 2).
Note that one cannot necessarily interpret the interaction effects (βEA and βSA ) as the causal
effects of an additional year of childhood exposure to lower-poverty areas. The differences in
estimated effects by age at RA could be driven by heterogeneity in the types of families who sign
up for MTO or comply with MTO treatments by age of children. Conceptually, our ability to
identify causal exposure effects is limited by the fact that the MTO experiment only randomized
voucher offers; it did not randomize the age at which children moved, which could be correlated
with other unobservable factors. Nevertheless, the linear interaction models in Table 8 do provide
further evidence supporting our main result that the MTO treatments had significant positive
effects on children who were young at the point of random assignment.
Non-Parametric Estimates by Age at Move. In Figure 2, we evaluate how the effects of the MTO
treatments vary with children’s ages at move using a non-parametric approach. These figures plot
ITT estimates of being assigned to the experimental voucher group by a child’s age at RA, grouping
children into two-year age bins. Given the small sample sizes in each age group, we focus on the
two outcomes for which we have the greatest precision: household income and college quality.
In Panel A, we regress household income on the treatment group indicators using a specification
analogous to Column 8 of Table 3. In Panel B, we regress college quality on these indicators using
the specification in Column 6 of Table 4. In each panel, we estimate separate regressions using the
data within each age bin and plot the experimental ITT estimates along with a 95% confidence
interval (shown by the dashed lines).
Panel A shows that the experimental voucher increased household income in adulthood by
approximately $2,000 for children who were offered the experimental voucher at or before age 10.
29

This effect declines steadily with age at RA and becomes negative around age 13. Similarly, Panel
B shows significant positive effects on college quality for children who move at young ages, which
then become negative for children moving in adolescence.36 In both cases, we cannot reject the
hypothesis that the relationship between age at move and the treatment effects is linear, although
the age-specific estimates are not very precise because of the small sample sizes. There is little
evidence of a “critical age” below which children must move to benefit from a better neighborhood.
The roughly linear pattern of exposure effects in the MTO data matches the quasi-experimental
findings of Chetty and Hendren (2015), who document a much more precisely estimated pattern of
linear childhood exposure effects using a sample of five million families that moved across counties.37

IV. Reconciling the Findings with Previous MTO Research
In this section, we reconcile our new findings with prior research on MTO’s impacts on the economic
outcomes of adults and children. We first show that, consistent with prior work, exposure to better
neighborhoods does not appear to improve adults’ outcomes. We then explain why our findings of
exposure effects for children were not detected in prior research. Finally, we evaluate whether our
findings on the heterogeneous effects of the MTO treatments by age at move may be an artifact
of multiple hypothesis testing given that prior research on MTO has tested for heterogeneity in
several other dimensions as well.

IV. A. MTO Impacts on Adults’ Economic Outcomes
Previous research has found that the MTO treatments had little impact on adults’ income and
employment rates (Kling et al. 2007, Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011). These prior studies used data from
state unemployment insurance (UI) records through 2008 and survey data collected in 2008-9. In
Table 9, we re-examine the effects of MTO on adults’ economic outcomes using the tax data. The
tax data allow us to follow the MTO adults through 2012 and track individuals who move across
state lines, who are missing from the state UI data of the original randomization sites.
36

Appendix Figure 2 plots the corresponding ITT estimates for the Section 8 voucher by age bin. We find qualitatively similar declining patterns for the impacts of the Section 8 voucher, although the estimates are attenuated in
magnitude, consistent with our earlier findings.
37
Chetty and Hendren’s quasi-experimental estimates of exposure effects are identified on a sample consisting
entirely of families who moved across counties, comparing the outcomes of children who move to different areas at
different ages. Since everyone in Chetty and Hendren’s sample moves a significant distance, their estimates net out
any fixed disruption costs of moving across social environments. In contrast, here we compare families who move to
a low-poverty area (who face disruption costs of relocating to a very different area) to families who largely remain in
higher-poverty areas (who do not pay such disruption costs). Our estimates therefore include the disruption cost of
moving to a different environment. This difference may explain why we find negative effects for children who move
at older ages in the MTO data, whereas Chetty and Hendren estimate positive exposure effects at all ages.

30

Table 9 presents ITT estimates of MTO treatment impacts on the individual earnings, household
income, and employment rates of MTO adults.38 The specifications in Columns 1-2 and 4-5 use
one observation per year from 2008-12 for each of the 4,215 adults in the linked MTO-Tax data,
while Column 3 uses data only from 2012.
Consistent with prior work, we find no effects of MTO treatments on any of the adults’ economic
outcomes. The point estimates tend to be slightly negative for the experimental group and slightly
positive for the Section 8 group, but all of the estimates are small and are not significantly different
from 0. For example, the experimental voucher ITT on mean individual earnings from 2008-2012
is -$354 (2.4% of the control group mean), with a standard error of $622. The corresponding TOT
estimate on individual earnings is -$734, 5.1% of the control group mean and 4.7% of the control
complier mean (Appendix Table 9b, Column 1). The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval
for the TOT estimate is $1,795, 12% of the control group mean. This is far below the 31% increase
in individual earnings for young children.
Exposure Effect Estimates. Clampet-Lundquist and Massey (2008) show that the number of
years an adult spends in a low-poverty area is correlated with their earnings and other economic
outcomes. Their findings raise the possibility of time of exposure impacts for adults similar to what
we documented above for children.39 We test for such exposure effects in Figure 3 by estimating
the effects of the MTO treatments on individual earnings by the number of years since random
assignment. We group the data into two-year bins based on the number of years elapsed since RA
and estimate ITT regression specifications using the data within each bin.
We first verify that the total time of exposure to low-poverty environments increases with time
since RA for adults who were assigned to the experimental voucher group relative to the control
group. Prior studies have observed that some MTO participants in the experimental group moved
back to higher-poverty areas over time, while some families in the control group moved to lowerpoverty areas over time (e.g., Clampet-Lundquist and Massey 2008). We assess the impacts of
such subsequent moves in Panel A of Figure 3. We regress the cumulative number of years that
the adult lived in a census tract with a poverty rate below 20% since RA on the MTO treatment
indicators. The figure plots the ITT effects of the experimental voucher on cumulative exposure to
low-poverty areas vs. the number of years since RA. It is clear that the total amount of exposure
38

As in prior work, the “adult” whom we follow in the MTO data and link to the tax data is the household head
at the point of RA, with preference given to the mother or other adult female guardian if present.
39
Clampet-Lundquist and Massey’s analysis does not directly identify causal exposure effects because it exploits
cross-sectional variation across individuals (which may be confounded by omitted variables) rather than the experimental variation generated by the randomly assigned treatments.

31

to low-poverty areas rises substantially over time in the experimental group relative to the control
group despite the fact that some families moved again in subsequent years.
Panel B of Figure 3 shows ITT effects of the experimental voucher on adults’ individual earnings
by years since RA, estimated using regressions analogous to that in Column 1 of Table 9. The
estimated impact on adult earnings is consistently close to zero when measuring earnings in the
1-10 years after RA, with no evidence of the increasing pattern that one would expect if time of
exposure in adulthood has a causal effect. The results are very similar for the Section 8 treatment
(Appendix Figure 3). We conclude that exposure to improved neighborhood environments – at least
for the range of moves generated by the MTO experiment – has little impact on adults’ economic
outcomes.40
Together with our findings in Section III, the results in Figure 3 show that it is the amount
of exposure to better neighborhoods during childhood (rather than total lifetime exposure) that
matters for long-term economic success. Moreover, these findings imply that the MTO treatment
effects on children’s outcomes do not arise from improvements in family income. Instead, they are
likely to be driven by direct effects of neighborhood environments on the children or to be mediated
by parental health and stress, which were improved by the MTO treatments (Ludwig et al. 2011,
Ludwig et al. 2012).

IV. B. MTO Impacts on Children’s Economic Outcomes
The MTO final impacts evaluation (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011) found no treatment effects on children’s economic outcomes using data from state UI records in 2008 and survey data from 2008-9.
In Table 10, we reconcile our findings with these earlier results. As a reference, we begin in Column
1 of Table 10 by replicating the specification in Column 2 of Table 3, which shows that the MTO
treatments had substantial positive effects on the individual earnings of younger children (those
under 13 at RA). The remaining columns present variants of this specification that highlight three
reasons why our findings differ from prior results.
First, if we had followed earlier MTO work in pooling younger and older MTO children, we also
would have found no mean effects on earnings in adulthood, as shown in Column 2 of Table 10.
40

Quigley and Raphael (2008) argue that the moves induced by MTO did not change neighborhood environments
by enough to offset the spatial disadvantages faced by low-skilled minority female household heads. Although larger
neighborhood changes could have different effects, we note that MTO moves did change neighborhood environments
quite substantially. TOT estimates show that adults who moved using an experimental voucher lived in lower-poverty
areas for approximately 5 more years on average (as implied by Figure 3) and experienced an 18 percentage point
reduction in neighborhood poverty (1.5 standard deviations in the U.S. census tract poverty distribution) up to the
point of the MTO final impacts evaluation, 10-15 years after RA (Ludwig et al. 2013).

32

Such pooled estimates hide the positive MTO effects on younger children and negative effects on
older children.
Second, we measure the earnings of children who were 24 years or older in 2012 in our data. If
instead we had conducted our analysis in 2008 – the time of the MTO final impacts evaluation –
we would have found positive but very imprecisely estimated effects on earnings for children who
were below age 13 at RA, as shown in Column 3. This is because one would have had only 552
observations on earnings for children who were less than 13 at RA in 2008. If one had attempted to
expand the sample by including all children in the analysis, as in Column 4, one would have again
obtained a point estimate close to 0.
Finally, partly because of these data limitations, prior analyses measured earnings at very early
ages, between the ages of 16-21. Columns 5 and 6 show that we find no effects on earnings at
these early ages in our data even when we focus on children who were less than 13 at RA. The
earnings impacts of MTO emerge only after children complete education and begin to enter the
labor market, as shown in Figure 1.
In sum, there is no inconsistency between our empirical findings and prior MTO evaluations.
The childhood exposure effects we document here were not apparent in prior studies because they
did not have adequate long-term data to observe the emergence of MTO’s impacts on earnings and
other outcomes in adulthood for children who moved at young ages.41

IV. C. Multiple Comparisons
Previous research has searched for impacts of MTO in a wide range of subgroups: across the five
treatment sites, for different races, and for each gender. Given the extensive subgroup analysis that
has been conducted in the MTO data, one may be concerned that our findings of significant effects
in certain age subgroups are an artifact of multiple hypothesis testing. Of course, examining many
subgroups can generate p-values that appear to be individually statistically significant purely by
chance.
To address this concern, we implement a set of parametric F tests for the null hypothesis that
there are no subgroup-specific treatment effects in the pooled data. These F tests adjust for the
41

The MTO final impacts evaluation (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011) found no significant effects of the MTO treatments
on educational outcomes or risky behaviors for children who moved at young ages when they were observed as
adolescents. The positive treatment effects for younger children show up only when we look at their outcomes in
adulthood. Hence, our findings differ from the conclusions of prior research on MTO both because we focus children
who moved at young ages and because we analyze long-term impacts rather than intermediate outcomes. We discuss
our findings in the context of prior research on MTO in greater detail in the conclusion.

over-rejection rate when analyzing any one subgroup separately by using a single joint test across
all subgroups in the pooled sample. In Panel A of Table 11, we test the hypothesis that there is
no treatment effect for either young children (under 13) or older children (13-18). We regress a
subset of the outcomes analyzed in Tables 3-6 above on the MTO treatment indicators (Exp and
S8) interacted with an indicator for being below age 13 at RA (Below13), including site dummies
as controls. We then test the hypothesis that the Exp and Exp-Below13 interaction effect are both
0 (row 1), the S8 and S8-Below13 interaction effect are both 0 (row 2), and both sets of treatment
effect estimates are 0 (row 3).
We reject the null of 0 treatment effects in both age subgroups with p < 0.05 in most cases,
especially for the experimental voucher group. For example, we reject the null hypothesis that the
experimental voucher has no effect on individual earnings in either age subgroup with p = 0.020.
For college quality, we reject the hypothesis that the experimental voucher has no effect in either
subgroup with p = 0.0006 and reject the hypothesis that the experimental and Section 8 treatments
have zero effects in all subgroups with p = 0.0020.
The tests in Panel A consider the age-specific subgroups we focus on in this study, but not
the other subgroups that have been analyzed in the broader literature. In Panel B, we test the
hypothesis that there is no treatment effect in any of the primary subgroups that have been studied
to date in the MTO data: randomization sites, racial groups, gender, and age at RA. As in Panel
A, we regress outcomes on the MTO treatment indicators interacted with all of these subgroup
indicators. We then test the hypothesis that the experimental indicator and all of its subgroup
interactions are 0 (row 1), the Section 8 indicator and all of its interactions are 0 (row 2), and both
sets of treatment effects are 0 (row 3).
The tests in Panel B have less power than those in Panel A because they consider many more
subgroups. Nevertheless, when we focus on the outcomes for which we have the most precise
estimates in our baseline analysis – e.g., the college outcomes and household income – we reject
the null of 0 treatment effects in all subgroups with p < 0.05 both for the experimental vs. control
comparison in row 1 and the pooled comparison in row 3.
As an alternative to the parametric F test, we implement a nonparametric permutation test
for subgroup heterogeneity using the p-values from our OLS regressions as critical values, as in
Ding et al. (2015). We generate 5,000 “placebo” samples in which we randomly re-assign treatment
status to families within randomization sites. In each placebo sample, we estimate the experimental
and Section 8 treatment effects for our five core outcomes (individual earnings, college attendance,
34

college quality, marriage, and poverty share in ZIP) for the twelve primary subgroups analyzed to
date (age above/below 13, male/female, five sites, and three racial groups). Finally, we calculate the
fraction of placebo simulations in which there is a subgroup where the p-values for all five outcomes
(for either the experimental or Section 8 group) fall below the corresponding true p-values for the
experimental treatment estimates in the below-age-13 subgroup. Intuitively, this approach asks, “if
one were to loop over the twelve subgroups and estimate treatment effects on the five outcomes,
what is the chance that one would obtain a set of p-values below the actual estimates purely by
chance in one of the subgroups?”
We find that fewer than one percent of the placebo replications produce a subgroup where the
p-values for the five outcomes lie below the values we estimate. Hence, the permutation test yields
an adjusted p-value for the null hypothesis that there is no treatment effect on any of the five
outcomes of p < 0.01. The permutation test and parametric F tests thus both indicate that the
significant treatment effects we detect are unlikely to be an artifact of making multiple comparisons.
Finally, it is important to note that we did not re-explore the MTO data arbitrarily searching for
subgroups that exhibit significant effects. Rather, motivated by the quasi-experimental evidence in
Chetty and Hendren (2015), we returned to the MTO data with a specific hypothesis that we would
find larger effects for younger children. The fact that the results align closely with this hypothesis
further reduces the likelihood that they reflect statistical noise driven by multiple hypothesis testing.

V. Cost-Benefit Analysis and Policy Implications
In this section, we compare the costs and benefits of the MTO interventions and discuss the
implications of our results for the design of affordable housing policies, on which the U.S. federal
government currently spends $46 billion per year (Collinson et al. 2015). We focus on two policy
questions. First, what are the costs and benefits of an MTO-type experimental voucher program
that moves families with young children out of traditional project-based public housing into lowerpoverty neighborhoods? Second, what are the benefits of expanding the existing Section 8 housing
voucher program? We begin by calculating the benefits of the MTO experimental vouchers, focusing
on the increased earnings for children who move when young. We then quantify the fiscal costs
of the program and discuss the policy implications of these calculations. We caution that all of
the calculations reported in this section should be treated as rough estimates because they rely on
several strong assumptions, starting with the basic premise that the treatment effects estimated
from the MTO experiment can be extrapolated to evaluate current policy interventions.
35

Earnings Benefits. The MTO experimental treatment increased individual earnings in early
adulthood for children whose families moved before they were age 13 by $3,477, 30.8% of the control
group mean (Table 3, Column 4). We translate this estimate into a predicted lifetime earnings
impact by assuming that (1) this 30.8% increase in individual earnings remains constant over the
lifecycle, (2) the lifecycle profile of earnings for MTO participants follows the U.S. population
average, and (3) the real wage growth rate is 0.5%, approximately the rate of wage growth in the
U.S. over the past decade, and the discount rate is 3%, approximately the current 30-year Treasury
bond rate.42
Under these assumptions, moving to a lower-poverty area when young (at age 8 on average)
using the experimental voucher increases total pre-tax lifetime earnings by $302, 000.43 The present
value of this increase in lifetime earnings is $99, 000 at age 8. For a family with two young children
at the point of the move, the MTO experimental treatment therefore has an estimated present
value of approximately $198, 000 in terms of increased children’s earnings.
Fiscal Costs. Next, we turn to the fiscal cost of the MTO experimental intervention. In
calculating this cost, it is important to recognize that the higher earnings of children who moved
to low-poverty areas at young ages increases tax revenue, reducing the cost of the program to the
government. We therefore begin by estimating the effects of the MTO treatments on income tax
revenue, a fiscal externality that is also a key input for normative analysis (Hendren 2013).
We examine MTO treatment impacts on tax filing rates and federal tax payments in adulthood
in Table 12. Column 1 shows ITT effects on tax filing rates when children are 24 or older. Among
younger children (Panel A), the experimental voucher treatment increases the fraction who file tax
returns in their mid-late twenties by 5.7 pp, while the Section 8 treatment increases the filing rate
by 4.8 pp. Column 2 reports ITT estimates on income taxes paid. The experimental ITT is $184,
while the Section 8 ITT is $109. The corresponding TOT estimates, reported in Column 3, show
that children whose families moved using the experimental voucher when they were young pay an
additional $394 in income taxes per year in their mid-twenties.44 Conversely, the MTO treatments
42

As shown in Figure 1, the assumption of a constant 30.8% effect is conservative, as the estimated treatment
effects increase steadily over the ages where we measure earnings.
43
We estimate the average lifecycle earnings profile by tabulating mean earnings by age for a random sample of
the U.S. population in 2012 from ages 26-65. We then apply a 0.5% wage growth rate and a 3% annual discount
rate to this profile to obtain an undiscounted sum of lifetime earnings for the average American of $1.74 million
and a PDV at age 8 of $570,000. The younger children in the MTO control group earn 56% of the mean individual
earnings in the U.S. population at age 26. Therefore, the estimated impact on undiscounted lifetime earnings is
0.308 × 0.56 × $1.74m = $302, 000.
44
Our measure of taxes paid does not include tax credits received. We find no significant treatment effects on
Earned Income or Child Tax Credit amounts. This is consistent with the fact that most of the earnings increases

36

reduce tax filing rates and tax payments by the older children, as expected given the negative effects
of the treatments on older children’s earnings.
We use the estimates in Table 12 to predict the total tax revenue impacts of the MTO experimental intervention on families with young children. The experimental ITT on tax payments of
$184 equals 1.63% of mean control group individual earnings. Under the same assumptions used
to calculate the lifetime earnings gains above, this translates to an increase in lifetime tax revenue
of $5, 200 in PDV at age 8. The TOT estimate of $394 implies a PDV increase in tax payments of
$11,200 per child who moves to a lower-poverty area at a young age. If there are two young (below
age 13) children per family on average, the increased federal tax payments would be worth $22,400
in PDV per family moved.
Olsen (2009) estimates that the direct fiscal costs of housing voucher programs are similar to
or slightly lower than the costs of project-based public housing.45 Olsen’s estimates imply that
the main incremental cost of moving families out of public housing using an MTO-type voucher
program would be the funding of counselors to help low-income families relocate. The mean MTO
counseling costs were $1,789 per family counseled (in 2012 dollars) or $3,783 per family who took
up a voucher (Goering et al. 1999, Table 4). This counseling cost of $3,783 is far smaller than
the tax revenue gain of $22,400 for each family with two young children that is moved. Thus, an
MTO-type experimental voucher policy that moves low-income families with young children out of
high-poverty housing projects will most likely save the government money.
Policy Implications. We now return to the policy questions posed at the beginning of this
section. On the narrower question of comparing MTO-type experimental vouchers to project-based
public housing, the data strongly suggest that vouchers targeted at families with young children
are likely to yield net gains. Indeed, such a policy is likely to reduce government expenditure while
increasing children’s future earnings substantially. However, it is critical to target such vouchers
effectively to obtain these benefits. First, targeting the vouchers so that families are required
to move to low-poverty areas is important. The MTO experimental vouchers – which restricted
families to move to low-poverty census tracts – improve children’s outcomes much more than
existing Section 8 vouchers that give families more flexibility in choosing where to live.46 Second,
induced by the treatments are on the intensive rather than extensive margin (Table 3), and many people move into
the phase-out region for these credits as they earn more.
45
The costs of public housing are debated because of disagreements about how one should account for the depreciation of housing projects.
46
An interesting question is why giving families greater choice in where to live appears to reduce long-term benefits
for children. One possibility is that the neighborhoods chosen by families with unrestricted Section 8 vouchers have
other amenities that families value more than their children’s long-term outcomes. However, the Section 8 voucher did

37

it is critical to target the vouchers to families with young children. As shown above, moving
families with older children out of existing public housing projects not only has smaller benefits,
but actually appears to be detrimental. The common practice of putting families on waitlists to
receive a housing voucher may be particularly inefficient, as this effectively allows many families to
move to better neighborhoods only when their children grow older.
We next consider the broader issue of offering Section 8 housing vouchers to more low-income
families. The MTO experiment shows that moving families who started out in high-poverty public
housing projects to lower-poverty areas has substantial long-term benefits for children. However,
the marginal Section 8 voucher may not induce such a move; instead, recent evidence suggests that
Section 8 housing vouchers are frequently used to rent better housing within the same neighborhood
rather than move to better neighborhoods (Jacob et al. 2015). Consistent with the lack of impact
of neighborhood environments, Jacob et al. (2015) find that obtaining a Section 8 voucher through
a lottery in Chicago has little impact on children’s long-term outcomes for families living in unsubsidized private housing. These results again suggest that one may need to carefully target housing
voucher subsidies to have an impact on children’s outcomes. Providing more Section 8 vouchers (or
equivalent cash benefits) may have little effect on children’s outcomes, but providing MTO-type
restricted vouchers that require families to move to better (e.g., low-poverty) neighborhoods may
be quite valuable.
Our simple calculations neglect many important factors that should be considered in a more
comprehensive cost-benefit evaluation. First, our calculations do not account for reductions in
transfer payments or gains from better outcomes in future generations. As discussed above, the
MTO treatments reduce dependence on long-term transfer programs such as disability insurance
(Appendix Table 3c, Column 4) and are likely to have persistent effects on subsequent generations
(Section III.E). Second, our calculations focus exclusively on the benefits in terms of children’s
earnings and thereby neglect other benefits, such as improved subjective well-being and health of
adults (Ludwig et al. 2012) and reduced rates of crime (Kling et al. 2005).
Finally, our calculations ignore any spillover effects on prior residents of the neighborhoods
where the MTO families moved. Although the MTO experiment itself yields no evidence on the
magnitude of these spillovers, Chetty and Hendren’s (2015) quasi-experimental estimates show that
not yield significantly greater benefits than the experimental voucher in terms of adults’ earnings or their subjective
well-being (Ludwig et al. 2012). Another possibility is that families make suboptimal neighborhood choices because
of behavioral biases, so that restrictions in the choice set and nudges to encourage families to move to lower-poverty
areas improve their own private welfare. See Chetty (2015) for further discussion of optimal policy and welfare
analysis of neighborhood choice in behavioral models.

38

mixed-income areas produce better outcomes for children in low-income families while generating,
if anything, slightly better outcomes for children in higher-income families as well. This finding
suggests that policies which reduce concentrated poverty may not have detrimental spillover effects
on higher-income households, but further work that directly estimates these spillover effects is
required to measure the social benefits of MTO-type policies.

VI. Discussion and Conclusion
This paper has presented a new analysis of the impacts of the Moving to Opportunity experiment on
children’s long-term outcomes. We find robust evidence that children who moved to lower-poverty
areas when they were young (below age 13) are more likely to attend college and have substantially
higher incomes as adults. These children also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults
and are less likely to become single parents themselves, suggesting that some of the benefits of
the initial MTO voucher treatment will persist into the following generation (the grandchildren of
the parents who received the MTO vouchers). In contrast with the large gains for young children,
moving to lower-poverty areas had negative effects on older youth. Finally, we replicate earlier
findings that the moves induced by MTO had little impact on adults’ economic outcomes.
Our findings show that a simple model featuring linear childhood exposure effects coupled with
a fixed disruption cost of moving to a distinctly different social environment can reconcile some of
the key findings and debates in the literature on neighborhood effects. First, our results suggest that
a substantial fraction of the systematic variation in economic outcomes across areas documented
in observational studies that attempt to control for selection effects (e.g., Brooks-Gunn et al. 1993,
Cutler and Glaeser 1997, Ellen and Turner 1997, Sampson et al. 2002) can indeed be explained by
causal effects of neighborhoods. Since many low-income individuals observed in a given area have
grown up in that area since an early age, childhood exposure effects of the type documented here
would generate significant differences in mean outcomes across areas in observational data. The fact
that MTO had no impact on adults’ outcomes (irrespective of exposure time to lower-poverty areas
in adulthood) implies that neighborhood effects operate primarily through “developmental” effects
during childhood (Sampson 2008) rather than contextual effects arising from spatial mismatch or
other forces (Kain 1968, Wilson 1996).
Our results also are consistent with recent studies that document the importance of childhood
exposure effects by studying immigrant assimilation (e.g., Bleakley and Chin 2004, Basu 2010,
van den Berg et al. 2014) and families that move across counties within the U.S. (Chetty and
39

Hendren 2015). In particular, the decline in MTO’s treatment effects for children with age at RA
coupled with the lack of an impact for adults matches Chetty and Hendren’s (2015) finding that
the gains from moving to better areas fall linearly with a child’s age at move.
Our findings also complement studies in the child development literature that have documented
robust correlations between years of exposure to high-poverty family environments and later outcomes (e.g., Duncan et al. 1994). Some studies in this literature argue that environmental conditions
in the earliest years of childhood (e.g., before age five) have much larger long-term impacts than
conditions in later years (e.g., Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997, Phillips et al. 2000, Heckman 2006).
Because we only observe long-term outcomes for children who were four or older at random assignment, our results demonstrate that improvements in neighborhood environments continue to have
large effects on children’s long-term outcomes even after early childhood. Whether the impacts
would be even larger at younger ages remains to be explored.
Although our findings help reconcile some key findings on neighborhood effects on outcomes
in adulthood, other pieces of evidence remain to be explained. Most notably, MTO’s treatment
effects on children’s short-term and medium-term outcomes are not fully aligned with the longterm impacts documented here (especially for boys) in three respects. First, the MTO treatments
improved young children’s short-term outcomes (e.g., reducing behavioral problems) in the years
immediately following random assignment, but these gains largely faded away over the next decade
(e.g., as measured by achievement on standardized tests).47 Yet the positive effects of the MTO
treatments re-emerge in adulthood, as measured by earnings and college attainment.48 Second,
MTO had more positive effects for girls than for boys for medium-term outcomes (Kling et al. 2007,
Ludwig et al. 2013), but we find no significant gender differences in MTO’s effects on children’s
outcomes in adulthood. Third, we find somewhat negative long-run impacts on older youth (ages 13
to 18 at RA), but earlier work showed positive initial impacts in terms of lower crime and problem
behaviors for these children in the first three years after RA.
Although further work remains in synthesizing the evidence that has been collected from the
MTO experiment, the results of this study demonstrate that offering low-income families housing
47

See Katz et al. (2001), Sanbonmatsu et al. (2006), Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011), and Sciandra et al. (2013). Jacob
(2004) also finds a similar lack of impacts on school outcomes for moves out of public housing in Chicago triggered
by the quasi-random timing of the demolition of housing projects.
48
This pattern echoes the results of other studies of early childhood and school interventions such as Perry PreSchool (Heckman et al. 2010), Head Start (Deming 2009), Project STAR (Chetty et al. 2011), and changes in teacher
quality (Chetty et al. 2014), all of which find a pattern of fade-out on intermediate outcomes and re-emergence in
adulthood. However, an important difference between the MTO intervention and the other interventions is that the
improvement in neighborhoods induced by MTO was an on-going treatment throughout childhood rather than a
one-time treatment whose impacts might later fade away.

40

vouchers and assistance in moving to lower-poverty neighborhoods has substantial benefits for
the families themselves and for taxpayers. It appears important to target such housing vouchers to
families with young children – perhaps even at birth – to maximize the benefits. Our results provide
less support for policies that seek to improve the economic outcomes of adults through residential
relocation. More broadly, our findings suggest that efforts to integrate disadvantaged families into
mixed-income communities are likely to reduce the persistence of poverty across generations.

FIGURE 1
Impacts of Experimental Voucher by Age of Earnings Measurement

Notes: This figure presents intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates of the impact of being assigned to the experimental voucher group
on individual earnings, varying the age at which earnings is measured from 20 to 28. The estimate at each age is obtained
from an OLS regression (weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of individual
earnings at that age on indicators for being assigned to the experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as
well as randomization site indicators. We plot the coefficient on the experimental voucher group indicator in this figure; the
corresponding estimates for the Section 8 voucher group are shown in Appendix Figure 1. The series in circles restricts the
sample to children below age 13 at random assignment; the series in triangles includes children between age 13 and 18 at
random assignment. The estimates in the two series are obtained from separate regressions. The estimates at age 26 exactly
match those reported in Column 5 of Table 3; the remaining estimates replicate that specification, varying the age at which
earnings is measured. The null hypothesis that the experimental impacts do not vary with the age of income measurement is
rejected with p < 0.01 for the below 13 series and p = 0.06 for the age 13-18 series. See notes to Table 3 for further details on
specifications and variable definitions.

FIGURE 2
Impacts of Experimental Voucher by Children’s Age at Random Assignment
A. Household Income, Age ≥ 24 ($)

B. College Quality, Ages 18-20 ($)

Notes: These figures plot intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates of the impact of being assigned to the experimental voucher group
by a child’s age at random assignment (RA). Panel A plots impacts on household income for those above age 24, while Panel
B plots impacts on the earnings-based index of college quality between ages 18-20. To construct Panel A, we first divide
children into two-year age groups based on their age at random assignment; for instance, children who were ages 12 or 13
at RA are placed in the “age 12” group in the figure. Since there are few children who are below age 10 at RA and whose
income is observed at age 24, we include those below age 10 at RA in the age 10 bin; likewise, we include children who are 18
at RA in the age 16 bin. Using data within each age bin, we regress household income on indicators for being assigned to the
experimental and section 8 voucher groups using the same specification as in Column 8 of Table 3, with one observation per
individual per year from 2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older. The solid line is a best fit line for the plotted estimates.
The dashed lines show the 95% confidence interval for each of the estimates. Panel B replicates Panel A using college quality
as the dependent variable. The regression specification used to estimate the coefficients plotted in Panel B is the same as that
in Column 6 of Table 4, with one observation per year when the child is between the ages of 18-20. We plot the coefficients
on the experimental voucher group indicator in this figure; the corresponding estimates for the Section 8 voucher group are
shown in Appendix Figure 2. See notes to Tables 3 and 4 for definitions of household income and college quality.

FIGURE 3
Impacts of Experimental Voucher on Adults by Years Since Random Assignment
A. Cumulative Years of Exposure to Low-Poverty Neighborhoods

B. Individual Earnings ($)

Notes: These figures plot intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates of the impact of being assigned to the experimental voucher group
by the number of years since random assignment (RA) for adults. Panel A plots impacts on the total number of years the
individual lived in a census tract with a poverty rate of less than 20% since RA. To construct Panel A, we first divide the
data into two-year groups based on the number of years since RA (e.g., data in the first and second year after the calendar
year of RA are assigned a value of 2). Using the data within each bin (with two observations per adult), we regress the total
number of years in which the individual lived in a census tract with a poverty rate below 20% since RA on indicators for being
assigned to the experimental and section 8 voucher groups as well as randomization site indicators, following the standard ITT
specification used for other outcomes. The solid line is a best fit line for the plotted estimates. Tract poverty rates were linearly
interpolated using data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses as well as the 2005-09 American Community Survey. Panel
B plots impacts on individual earnings, and is constructed using the same approach as in Panel A. The regression specification
used to estimate the coefficients plotted in Panel B is analogous to that in Column 1 of Table 9, with one observation per adult
at age 24 or above for the relevant years in each bin. We plot the coefficients on the experimental voucher group indicator in
this figure; the corresponding estimates for the Section 8 voucher group are shown in Appendix Figure 3. See notes to Tables
9 for the definition of individual earnings.

Notes: This table presents summary statistics and balance tests for match rates and a subset of variables
collected prior to randomization; Appendix Table 1a replicates this table for all 52 control variables we use in our
analysis. The estimates in the first row (fraction linked to tax data) are based on all children in the MTO data who
were born in or before 1991. The estimates in the remaining rows use the subset of these observations
successfully linked to the tax data. Columns 1-3 include children below age 13 at random assignment; Columns 46 include those above age 13 at random assignment. Columns 1 and 4 show the control group mean for each
variable. Columns 2 and 5 report the difference between the experimental voucher and control group, which we
estimate using an OLS regression (weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities across sites and
over time) of each variable on indicators for being assigned to the experimental voucher group, the section 8
voucher group, as well as indicators for randomization site. Columns 3 and 6 report the coefficient for being
assigned to the section 8 group from the same regression. The estimates in Columns 2-3 and 5-6 are obtained
from separate regressions. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * =
p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). The final row lists the number of individuals in the control, experimental, and section 8 groups
in the linked MTO-Tax data sample.

Notes: Columns 1, 2, 4 and 6 report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for
differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being assigned to the
experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as randomization site indicators. Columns 3, 5
and 7 report treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates using a 2SLS specification, instrumenting for voucher takeup
with the experimental and section 8 assignment indicators. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by
family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Panel A restricts the sample to children below age 13 at random
assignment; Panel B includes children between age 13 and 18 at random assignment The estimates in Panels A and
B are obtained from separate regressions. The dependent variable in Column 1 is an indicator for the family taking up
an MTO voucher and moving. The dependent variable in Columns 2 and 3 is the census tract-level poverty rate one
year after random assignment. The dependent variable in Columns 4-7 is the duration-weighted mean poverty rate in
the Census tracts (columns 4 and 5) and ZIP codes (columns 6 and 7) where the child lived from random assignment
till age 18. The sample in this table includes all children born before 1991 in the MTO data for whom an SSN was
collected prior to RA because we were unable to link the MTO tract-level location information to the tax data. This
sample is nearly identical our linked analysis sample because 99.1% of the children with non-missing SSN's are
matched to the tax data. The duration-weighted poverty rate is constructed using information on the addresses where
the youth lived from random assignment up to their 18th birthday, weighted by the amount of time spent at each
address. Census tract poverty rates in each year are interpolated using data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial
censuses as well as the 2005-09 American Community Survey, as in Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011); ZIP code poverty
rates are from Census 2000 only and are not interpolated.

Notes: Columns 1-3 and 5-9 report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over
time) of an outcome on indicators for being assigned to the experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as randomization site indicators. Column
4 reports treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates using a 2SLS specification, instrumenting for voucher takeup with the experimental and section 8 assignment
indicators. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Panel A restricts the sample to children below age 13 at
random assignment; Panel B includes children between age 13 and 18 at random assignment. The estimates in Panels A and B are obtained from separate regressions.
The number of individuals is 2,922 in Panel A (except in column 5, where it is 1,625) and 2,331 in Panel B. The dependent variable in Column 1 is individual W-2 wage
earnings, summing over all available W-2 forms. Column 1 includes one observation per individual per year from 2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older. Column 2
replicates Column 1 using individual earnings as the dependent variable. Individual earnings is defined as the sum of individual W-2 and non-W-2 earnings. Non-W-2
earnings is adjusted gross income minus own and spouse's W-2 earnings, social security and disability benefits, and UI payments, divided by the number of filers on the
tax return. Non-W-2 earnings is recoded to 0 if negative and is defined as 0 for non-filers. Column 3 replicates Column 2, controlling for the characteristics listed in Online
Appendix Table 1a. Column 4 reports TOT estimates corresponding to the ITT estimates in Column 2. In Column 5, we measure earnings in the year when the individual is
26 years old. In Column 6, we measure earnings in 2012, limiting the sample to those 24 or older in 2012. Columns 7-9 replicate Column 1 with the following dependent
variables: employment (an indicator for having positive W-2 earnings), household income (adjusted gross income plus tax-exempt social security benefits and interest
income for those who file tax returns, the sum of W-2 wage earnings, SSDI benefits, and UI benefits for non-filers, and 0 for non-filers with no W-2 earnings, SSDI, or UI
benefits), and individual earnings growth (the change in individual earnings between year t-5 and the current year t ).

Notes: All columns report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities across sites
and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being assigned to the experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as
randomization site indicators. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Panel A restricts the
sample to children below age 13 at random assignment; Panel B includes children between age 13 and 18 at random assignment. The estimates in
Panels A and B are obtained from separate regressions. The dependent variable in Column 1 is an indicator for attending college in a given year (having
one or more 1098-T tax forms filed on one's behalf), pooling data over the three years when the individual is ages 18-20 with one observation per year
per individual. Years before 1999 are excluded because 1098-T data are available beginning only in 1999. Columns 2-5 replicate Column 1, using
college attendance at each age between 18 and 21 as the dependent variable. The dependent variable in Column 6 is Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff's
(2014) earnings-based index of college quality, again pooling data from ages 18-20 starting in 1999. This index is constructed using U.S. population data
as the mean earnings at age 31 of students enrolled in that college at age 20; children who do not attend college are assigned the mean earnings at age
31 of children who are not enrolled in any college at age 20. Columns 7-10 replicate Column 2, using college quality at each age between 18 and 21 as
the dependent variable.

Notes: All columns report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for differences
in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being assigned to the
experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as randomization site indicators. Standard
errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Panel A restricts the
sample to children below age 13 at random assignment; Panel B includes children between age 13 and 18 at
random assignment. The estimates in Panels A and B are obtained from separate regressions. Column 1 includes
one observation per individual per year from 2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older. The dependent variable
in column 1 is an indicator for filing a tax return as a married individual in a given year. Columns 2 and 3 replicate
Column 1 for males and females, respectively. Columns 4-7 restrict the sample to females and include one
observation per individual. The dependent variable in Column 4 is an indicator for having a child before June 2014.
In Column 5, it is an indicator for having a child before the age of 19. Column 6 restricts the sample to females
who have a birth; the dependent variable in this column is an indicator for having a father listed on the first-born
child's SSN application. In Column 7, the dependent variable is an indicator for having one or more births, with no
father listed on the SSN application for the first birth.

Notes: All columns report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for differences
in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being assigned to the
experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as randomization site indicators. Standard
errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). In this table, we only
include observations where ZIP code information in the relevant year is available (based on 1040 tax returns, W2's, or other information returns). In 2012, ZIP code data are available for 79.56% of observations for children age
24 or older. Panel A restricts the sample to children below age 13 at random assignment; Panel B includes
children between age 13 and 18 at random assignment. The estimates in Panels A and B are obtained from
separate regressions. Outcome variables are defined using ZIP-code level data from the 2000 Census. All
columns include one observation per individual per year from 2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older and in
which ZIP code information is available. The dependent variable in Columns 1 is the poverty share (share of
households below the poverty line in the 2000 Census) in the individual's ZIP code. Columns 2-4 replicate Column
1 with the following dependent variables: mean income in the ZIP code (aggregate income divided by the number
of individuals 16-64), black share (number of people who are black alone divided by total population in 2000) and
single mother share (number of households with female heads and no husband present with own children present
divided by the total number of households with own children present).

Notes: This table replicates the intent-to-treat (ITT) OLS regression specifications in Column 2 of Table 3
(individual earnings), Column 6 of Table 4 (college quality), and Column 1 of Table 6 (poverty share)
separately for male and female children. Columns 1 and 2 report the coefficient on the indicator for being
assigned to the experimental voucher group; columns 3 and 4 report the coefficient on the indicator for being
assigned to the Section 8 voucher group. The estimates in Columns 1 and 3 are for males, and the two
estimates in each row of these columns come from a single OLS regression analogous to that in Column 2 of
Table 3. The estimates in Columns 2 and 4 for females are constructed analogously. Standard errors,
reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Control group means
for each estimation sample are reported in square brackets. Panel A restricts the sample to children below
age 13 at random assignment; Panel B includes children between age 13 and 18 at random assignment. See
the notes to Tables 3, 4 and 6 for further details on specifications and variable definitions.

Notes: This table reports intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities
across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being assigned to the experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher
group, interactions between the experimental/section 8 indicators and age at random assignment (RA), and interactions between
randomization site indicators and age at RA. All regressions are estimated using all children in the sample with available outcome data.
Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). The dependent variable is individual
earnings in Column 1 and household income in Column 2 and 3. See notes to Table 3 for definitions of these variables. In Columns 4-7, we
replicate Column 1 with the dependent variables used in Column 6 of Table 4, Column 1 of Table 5, Column 1 of Table 6, and Column 2 of
Table 12. See notes to those tables for definitions of these variables. Columns 1, 2, and 5-7 include one observation per individual per year
from 2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older. Column 3 includes one observation per individual at age 26. Column 4 includes one
observation per individual per year from ages 18-20, as in Table 4. The Experimental x Age at RA coefficient can be interpreted as the change
in the impact of being assigned to the experimental group for a child who is one year older at random assignment, and the Section 8 x Age at
RA coefficient can be interpreted analogously.

Notes: All columns report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for
differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being
assigned to the experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as randomization site
indicators. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** =
p<0.01). The sample consists of all individuals in the linked MTO-Tax dataset who were not classified as
children at the point of random assignment. The number of individuals is 4,215 in all columns. The dependent
variable in Columns 1-3 is individual earnings. Column 1 includes one observation per individual per year from
2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older. Column 2 replicates Column 1, controlling for the predetermined characteristics listed in Appendix Table 1a. In Column 3 we replicate Column 1 using data from
2012 only. Columns 4 and 5 replicate Column 1 using employment and household income as the dependent
variables. See notes to Table 3 for definitions of all dependent variables.

Notes: All columns report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for
differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being
assigned to the experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as randomization
site indicators. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * =
p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). The dependent variable is individual earnings in all columns, defined in the notes
to Table 3. Column 1 replicates the specification in Column 2 of Table 3, Panel A, and includes
children below age thirteen at age of random assignment. This specification includes one observation
per individual per year from 2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older. Column 2 replicates Column
1, pooling all children (irrespective of age at random assignment) in the sample. Columns 3 and 4
replicate Columns 1 and 2, limiting the sample to data from the 2008 tax year, which was the last year
of data available for the MTO final impacts evaluation (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011). Columns 3 and 4
therefore only include children who were 24 or older in 2008. Column 5 replicates column 1, with one
observation per year in which the child is between the ages of 16-21, using all years in which we
observe individual earnings (1999-2012). Column 6 replicates Column 4, restricting the sample to
children between the ages of 16 and 21 in 2008, as in the MTO final impacts evaluation.

Notes: This table presents p-values for non-zero MTO treatment effects in subgroups for selected outcomes
analyzed in Tables 3 to 6. In Panel A, we regress the outcome on the MTO treatment indicators (Exp and S8)
interacted with an indicator for being below age 13 at RA (Below13), including site dummies as controls, and
clustering standard errors by family. We then run F tests for the null hypothesis that the Exp and Exp-Below13
interaction effect are both 0 (row 1), the S8 and S8-Below13 interaction effect are both 0 (row 2), and both sets
of treatment effect estimates are 0 (row 3). In Panel B, we regress the outcomes on the MTO treatment
indicators interacted with the following subgroup indicators: the five randomization sites, racial groups (Black,
Hispanic, and Other), gender, and age at RA below 13. As in Panel A, we then test the hypothesis that the
experimental indicator and all of its subgroup interactions are 0 (row 1), the Section 8 indicator and all of its
interactions are 0 (row 2), and both sets of treatment effects are 0 (row 3). See notes to Tables 3-6 for
definitions of the outcome variables.

Notes: Columns 1 and 2 report intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from OLS regressions (weighted to adjust for
differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being
assigned to the experimental voucher group and the section 8 voucher group as well as randomization site
indicators. Column 3 reports treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates using a 2SLS specification,
instrumenting for voucher takeup with the experimental and section 8 assignment indicators. Standard errors,
reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Panel A restricts the
sample to children below age 13 at random assignment; Panel B includes children between age 13 and 18 at
random assignment. The estimates in Panels A and B are obtained from separate regressions. The
dependent variable in columns 1 is an indicator for filing a 1040 tax return. In Columns 2 and 3, the dependent
variable is total taxes paid, defined as the total tax field from form 1040 for filers and total taxes withheld on W2 forms for non-filers. Columns 1 and 2 include one observation per individual per year from 2008-12 in which
the individual is 24 or older. Column 3 reports TOT estimates corresponding to the ITT estimates in column 3.

Notes: This table replicates Table 1 in the text for all the pre-determined variables used in the regressions that include
controls. Columns 1-3 restrict the sample to individuals below age 13 at random assignment; Columns 4-6 include individuals
above age 13 at random assignment. Columns 1 and 4 show the control group mean for each variable. Columns 2 and 5
report the difference between the experimental voucher and control group, which we estimate using an OLS regression
(weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time) of an outcome on indicators for being
assigned to the experimental voucher group, the section 8 voucher group, and randomization site. Columns 3 and 6 report
the coefficient for being assigned to the section 8 voucher group from the same regression. The estimates in Columns 2-3
and 5-6 are obtained from separate regressions. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ =
p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Out of the 196 differences in this table, there are 13 differences with p<0.05 and 2 with
p<0.01. The final row lists the numbers of individuals in the control, experimental, and section 8 groups in the linked MTO-Tax
Data. See Sanbonmatsu et al. (2011) for details on variable definitions. Note that certain variables (e.g., child weight at birth)
were not collected for older youth and are therefore omitted from the age 13-18 group.

Notes: This table reports the mean, standard deviation, median, the number of observations, and the number of
children for all outcome variables used in Tables 3-8 in the text. Median income statistics are rounded to the
nearest $100 to protect confidentiality. The sample consists of all children in the linked MTO-Tax dataset for whom
the relevant variables are available between 1999-2012. Variables that pool ages (age ≥ 24) are measured
pooling data from years 2008-12; all other variables are measured at a single point for each individual. Fertility
outcomes are for female children only. See notes to Tables 3-6 and 12 for variable definitions.

Notes: This table lists some of the most common locations where families who moved using an MTO voucher lived before and after they moved. The
locations listed are not comprehensive and are for illustrative purposes only; MTO families moved to a variety of different neighborhoods beyond the small
subset listed here. Panel A lists neighborhoods based on the most common housing projects where MTO families who moved using a Section 8 or
experimental voucher lived at the point of random assignment. Panel B lists neighborhoods based on the most common ZIP codes for the first recorded
move address for families who were assigned to the experimental voucher group and took up the voucher they were offered. Panel C replicates Panel B for
the Section 8 group. The neighborhoods were identified by mapping the names of housing projects (Panel A) and ZIP codes (Panels B and C) to
neighborhood names relying on information from web searches; since many of the housing projects have been torn down and ZIP codes do not uniquely
identify neighborhoods, these locations may not correspond exactly to current neighborhood definitions and conditions.

Notes: This table replicates Table 3 in the text, but reports treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates instead of ITT estimates in all columns. The TOT
coefficients are estimated using a 2SLS specification (weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time and including
randomization site fixed effects), instrumenting for voucher takeup with the experimental and section 8 assignment indicators. Standard errors, reported in
parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). CCM Exp. denotes the control complier mean corresponding to the experimental
voucher group. CCM Exp. is constructed as the mean value of the dependent variable in the estimation sample among compliers (i.e., those who took up
the voucher) in the experimental group minus the TOT estimate of the experimental effect. CCM Sec. 8. denotes the control complier mean corresponding
to the Section 8 group, constructed analogously. Note that Columns 2 and 4 are identical to make the structure of this table match that of Table 3 in the
text. See notes to Table 3 for further details on variable definitions and specifications.

Notes: Each column replicates the intent-to-treat OLS regression specification in Column 1 of Table 3 with a different dependent variable. All columns include one
observation per individual per year from 2008-12 in which the individual is 24 or older. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * =
p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Panel A restricts the sample to children below age 13 at random assignment; Panel B includes children between age 13 and 18 at random
assignment. The estimates in Panels A and B are obtained from separate regressions. The dependent variable in Column 1 is individual W-2 wage earnings, summing
over all available W-2 forms. Column 2 uses non-W-2 earnings as the dependent variable. Non-W-2 earnings is defined as adjusted gross income minus own and
spouse's W-2 earnings, social security and disability benefits, and UI payments, divided by the number of filers on the tax return. Non-W-2 earnings is recoded to 0 if
negative and is defined as 0 for non-filers. Column 3 uses individual earnings, defined as the sum of W-2 earnings and non-W-2 earnings. Column 4 uses total social
security and disability insurance (SSDI) benefits as the dependent variable, while Column 5 uses unemployment benefits. The dependent variable in Column 6 is
individual income, which is individual earnings plus SSDI and unemployment benefits. Column 7 uses the spouse's individual income as the dependent variable.
Spouse's individual income is defined analogously to own individual income for married individuals and is 0 for single individuals. Column 8 uses household income,
defined as adjusted gross income plus tax-exempt social security benefits and interest income for those who file tax returns, the sum of W-2 wage earnings, SSDI
benefits, and UI benefits for non-filers, and 0 for non-filers with no W-2 earnings, SSDI, or UI benefits. Household income is recoded to 0 if negative, which is why the
estimates in Columns 6 and 7 do not sum exactly to those in Column 8. Column 9 and 10 replicate the specifications in Columns 3 and 8, top-coding the income
measures at $100,000.

Notes: This table replicates Table 5 in the text, but reports treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates instead of
ITT estimates in all columns. The TOT coefficients are estimated using a 2SLS specification (weighted to adjust
for differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time and including randomization site fixed effects),
instrumenting for voucher takeup with the experimental and section 8 assignment indicators. Standard errors,
reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). CCM Exp. denotes the
control complier mean corresponding to the experimental voucher group. CCM Exp. is constructed as the mean
value of the dependent variable in the estimation sample among compliers (i.e., those who took up the voucher) in
the experimental group minus the TOT estimate of the experimental effect. CCM Sec. 8. denotes the control
complier mean corresponding to the Section 8 group, constructed analogously. See notes to Table 5 for further
details on variable definitions and specifications.

Notes: This table replicates the intent-to-treat (ITT) OLS regression specifications in Column 2 of Table 3 (individual
earnings), Column 6 of Table 4 (college quality), Column 1 of Table 5 (married) and Column 1 of Table 6 (poverty share),
separately by racial group. Columns 1-3 report estimates on the indicator being assigned to the experimental group, while
columns 4-6 report estimates on the indicator for being assigned to the Section 8 group. The estimates in Columns 1 and 4
are for Hispanic children and the two estimates in each row of these columns come from a single OLS regression analogous
to that in Column 1 of Table 3. The estimates in Columns 2 and 5 for Non-black, Non-Hispanics and 3 and 6 for Black NonHispanics are constructed analogously. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * =
p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). Control group means for each estimation sample are reported in square brackets. See the notes to
Tables 3-6 for further details on specifications and variable definitions.

Notes: This table replicates Table 8 in the text, but reports treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates instead of ITT estimates in all columns. The
TOT coefficients are estimated using a 2SLS specification (weighted to adjust for differences in sampling probabilities across sites and over time
and including randomization site fixed effects). In this specification, we instrument for four variables -- takeup of each type of voucher and
interactions of these two takeup indicators with age at random assignment -- with the experimental and section 8 assignment indicators and their
interactions with age at random assignment. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** =
p<0.01). See notes to Table 8 for further details on variable definitions and specifications.

Exp. denotes the control complier mean corresponding to the experimental voucher group. CCM Exp. is
constructed as the mean value of the dependent variable in the estimation sample among compliers (i.e.,
those who took up the voucher) in the experimental group minus the TOT estimate of the experimental effect.
CCM Sec. 8. denotes the control complier mean corresponding to the Section 8 group, constructed
analogously. See notes to Table 9 for further details on variable definitions and specifications.

Notes: Columns 1-6 of this table replicate the intent-to-treat (ITT) OLS regression specifications in Column 2 of Table 3 (individual earnings),
Column 6 of Table 4 (college quality), Column 1 of Table 5 (married), Column 1 of Table 6 (poverty share), and Column 2 of Table 12 (income taxes
paid) varying the age restriction used to define "young" children. The first two columns include children below age 12 at random assignment (RA),
Columns 3 and 4 include children below age 13 at RA (the specification used in the main text), and Columns 5 and 6 include children below age 14
at RA. Columns 1, 3, and 5 report ITT estimates on the indicator for being assigned to the experimental group, while Columns 2, 4, and 6 report
estimates on the indicator for being assigned to the Section 8 group. Column 7 replicates the same regression specifications as in Columns 3 and 4
(using children below age 13 at RA), but pools the Section 8 and Experimental treatment groups by using a single indicator for being assigned to
either of the two groups as the independent variable in each regression. Column 8 replicates Column 7 including controls for the baseline
covariates listed in Appendix Table 1a. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered by family (⁺ = p<0.10, * = p<0.05, ** = p<0.01). See
the notes to Tables 3-6 and 12 for further details on specifications and variable definitions.
