We focus chiefly on limited enforceability and limited worker liquidity.  Inefficient severance of employment relationships, payment of efficiency wages, the relative response of wages and employment to business cycle shocks, and the propagation of these shocks are linked to the nature of contracting imperfections.\n\n",
