    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the role of risk preferences and frictions in portfolio choice using variation in 401(k) default options. Patterns of active choice in response to different default funds imply that, absent participation frictions, 94% of investors prefer holding stocks, with an equity share of retirement wealth declining with age\u2014patterns markedly different from observed allocations. We use this quasi-experiment to estimate a life cycle model and find a relative risk aversion of 2, EIS of 0.4, and $200 portfolio adjustment cost. Our results suggest that low levels of stock market participation in retirement accounts are due to participation frictions rather than non-standard preferences such as loss aversion.\n\n",
