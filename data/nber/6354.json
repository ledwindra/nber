Using constant-relative-risk-aversion (CRRA) utility a CRRA coefficient below ten that exhibit, on average, excessive pessimism over expansions and excessive optimism over\" contractions, our model is able to match the first and second moments of the equity premium and\" risk-free rate, as well as the persistence and predictability of excess returns found in the data.\"\n\n",
