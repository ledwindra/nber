Debt Deleveraging and The Exchange Rate

NBER Working Paper No. 17944
March 2012, Revised November 2012
JEL No. E52,F32,F41
ABSTRACT
Deleveraging from high debt can provoke deep recession with significant international side effects.
The exchange rate of the deleveraging country will depreciate in the short run and appreciate in the
long run. The real interest rate will fall by more than in the rest of the world. Bounds and policies that
constrain the adjustment can prolong and deepen the recession. Early exit strategies from accommodating
monetary policy can be quite harmful, as can such other policies as keeping interest rates too high
during the deleveraging period. The analysis also applies to a monetary union facing internal adjustment
of current account imbalances.

The decade leading up to the financial crisis was marked by divergences and disequilibria. Global imbalances have been at the center of the debate, with several economists
warning against the unsustainability of the US external position. The euro area has experienced internal current account divergences, producing an enormous accumulation of
debt. The crisis was most severe in the economies that had piled up too much private or
public debt in one form or another. It is still being debated whether the divergences of
the past actually caused the crisis or merely reflected other underlining problems.1 In any
case, the general tendency is for the crisis-ridden countries to reduce debt. Deleveraging
raises interesting questions on macroeconomic adjustment and international spillovers.
How do monetary policy and the exchange rate affect the adjustment? What happens in
a monetary union in which some countries are forced to deleverage? What if mistaken
policies are followed? These are some of the questions this work aims to answer.
Deleveraging is a costly process: it forces debtor countries to cut spending sharply and
depresses demand. A healthy correction would involve an increase in spending in the rest
of the world. But international relative prices are not immune to the adjustment, and the
exchange rate can in fact accompany the process and attenuate its costs.2 If the fall in
demand is sharper for domestic goods, the excess supply of these goods globally lowers
their prices relative to foreign prices and expands overall demand for them, thus easing
the depressive impact of deleveraging. These changes in relative prices can be achieved
by depreciation of the deleveraging country’s currency, but if exchange rates are fixed, as
in a monetary union, subdued inflation there should achieve adjustment but at the cost
of a longer contraction. In the longer run, a country that has paid down part of its debt is
richer than at first, since there is less debt to serve, so the demand for domestic goods is
relatively higher. The exchange rate swings from short-term depreciation to appreciation
in the long run.
Other relative price movements are also critical to a smooth adjustment. These are
intertemporal relative prices such as real interest rates. The debt of some agents corresponds to assets of others, either domestic or foreign. In the course of the adjustment,
to reduce their asset holdings creditors should increase consumption, which could be favored by a fall in the real interest rate. Given that the real exchange rate depreciates in
the short run and appreciates in the long run, the real interest rate of the deleveraging
country falls by more.
In shorts, a smooth adjustment to a deleveraging shock in some part of the world econ1

An interesting discussion is in Obstfeld (2011), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2010).
Krugman (2011a) discusses the importance of exchange-rate movements when there is debt deleveraging.

omy requires short-run depreciation and long-run appreciation of the deleverager’s real
exchange rate and a sharper short-term fall in its real interest rate than in the rest of the
world. Constraints or policies that impede these mechanisms can only prolong the contraction. For instance, the zero-lower-bound constraint on the nominal interest rate can
keep the real rate from falling when prices are sticky, causing a longer contraction. And,
fixed-exchange-rate or controlled-rate policy regimes can also lead to a more protracted
stagnation. A monetary union falls into the latter category, since sluggish adjustment
in relative prices makes deleveraging in some countries inherently costly. Other policies,
such as keeping nominal interest rates too high or exiting too early from the zero lower
bound, can be even more damaging.
We discuss these issues using a simple two-country world economy in which some
agents are borrowing-constrained. Our environment can also describe a two-country monetary union in which one is reducing debt. Deleveraging is modelled as a tightening debt
constraint. There are multiple traded goods but consumers are biased towards those produced in their own country. We consider first an environment with flexible prices and
wages, then one with nominal rigidities. We study optimal monetary policy from a global
perspective when the exchange rate is free to float and in a monetary union, in comparison with alternative monetary policy regimes. In the flexible price and wage model, debt
deleveraging cuts the country’s liabilities by 20% of GDP, which depreciates the currency
by more than 10% in the short run and drives the real interest rate well below zero. In
the model with nominal rigidities, a similar experiment can lead to a deep recession with
important spillovers to the other country, in particular when the exchange rate is fixed.
A floating-exchange-rate regime can attenuate the contraction. A prolonged stay at the
zero lower bound helps the economic recovery, at the cost of excess inflation. A policy
of high nominal interest rates can be very detrimental, pushing the world economy into
deep recession and deflation. Under optimal policy, the exchange rate will depreciate at
the beginning of deleveraging and suddenly appreciate at the end. Interest rates will go
to the zero lower bound after some quarters and remain there until deleveraging ends.
Under a monetary union, inflation rates will be more volatile with inflation picking up
initially in the non-deleveraging country and later in the adjusting country.
This paper is closely related to Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2010) and Philippon and Midrigan (2011), who have studied debt deleveraging in
closed economies. In the current debate on the unwinding of global imbalances, Feldstein
(2011) and Krugman (2011a,b) have stressed the importance of exchange rate movements
in correcting global imbalances. Earlier works by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001, 2005, 2007)
also studied the exchange-rate implications of a sudden improvement in one country’s
2

current account balance, conducting some comparative-static experiments. Our focus
here is on dynamic adjustment, on the role of monetary policy taking into account the
zero lower bound and on optimal monetary policy from a global perspective both under a
floating-rate regime and a monetary union. Policies at the zero lower bound, in an open
economy, have been explored by Svensson (2001, 2003) and Fujiwara et al. (2010, 2011),
but in different models without debt deleveraging. There is also substantial literature on
open economies analyzing credit-constrained economies and the implications of relaxing
or restricting credit access for the equilibrium economy: see among others Aghion et al.
(2001), Aoki et al. (2010) and Mendoza (2010) and more recently Devereux and Yetman
(2010). In an open-economy model, Cook and Devereux (2011) have studied the optimal
response to preferences’ shocks which bring one country to the zero lower bound while
appreciating its currency.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes a deleveraging shock in a
simple two-country open-economy endowment model. Section 2 extends the basic model
to include nominal rigidities and endogenous output. Section 3 discusses optimal policy.
Section 4 discusses the dynamic implications of deleveraging with alternative sub-optimal
monetary policies in a monetary union. Section 6 concludes. A separate appendix reports
the main equations of the model and the solution method.

1

A simple model

We adopt a simple two-country endowment economy to study how debt deleveraging in one
country spreads to the rest of the world economy. The two countries are Home, denoted
by H, and Foreign, denoted by F . Each country has an endowment of a good. The two
goods, H and F respectively, are traded frictionlessly. In country H, there are two groups
of consumers with different discount factors. The first are savers, of mass θ, with discount
factor β ∗ . The second are borrowers, of mass (1 − θ), with discount factor β. Borrowers
are more impatient than savers and have a lower discount factor, 0 < β < β ∗ < 1. In
what follows, the index “s” identifies the savers and “b” the borrowers in country H. All
the consumers in country F have the same discount factor, β ∗ , coinciding with that of
the savers in country H.
The inhabitants of country H maximize utility from consumption

Foreign currency. Preferences are biased towards domestic goods, since we assume that
α = α∗ > 1/2. For this reason, our model generates deviations from purchasing power

Consumers in the Home country receive in every period t an endowment YH,t of good
H, which they can sell at the price PH,t ; they consume a bundle Ctj of goods H and F at
j
/(1 + it ), in units of currency of country H, and
price Pt ; borrow or lend resources Dt+1
pay back or receive the face value of the funds lent in the previous period Dtj . A positive
value for Dj denotes nominal debt. Dj is the only asset traded internationally and 1 + i
is the one-period risk-free gross nominal interest rate on domestic currency.3 As a result,
the flow budget constraint for consumers in the Home country is:
Pt Ctj = PH,t YH,t +

j

− Dtj .
1 + it

(4)

There is a limit on the amount of the debt that is proportional to nominal GDP
Dtj ≤ k(PH,t YH,t ),

(5)

where k > 0. Similar constraints have been used in other open-economy models, such
as Aoki et al. (2010), Devereux and Yetman (2010) and Mendoza (2010). They are
justified in terms of the guarantees that international creditors require when borrowers
have limited commitment. As in Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), we do not model the
source of this constraint but interpret it as the maximum size of the debt that can be
considered safe at a given point in time. A change in this limit –in particular its reduction
over time– constitutes the debt-deleveraging experiment analyzed here.4

We do not impose that k should be less than 1, since the pledgeable collateral can go beyond current
income and up to the present discounted value of all future income. As will be clear in the next section,
k should be strictly less than 1/(1 − β).

(9)

Both equations hold with equality when the borrowing limit is not binding.
We define aggregate consumption of consumers in country H as Ct = θCts + (1 − θ)Ctb ,
where θ is the fraction of savers. Equilibrium in goods and asset markets implies
YH,t = Tt1−α [αCt + (1 − α)Qt Ct∗ ],

(10)

YF,t

(11)

Dt∗ + θDts + (1 − θ)Dtb = 0.

(12)

Combining the equilibrium in the goods market, the terms of trade can be written as
YH,t
Tt = ∗



(1 − α)Ct + αQt Ct∗

,

(13)

while the real exchange rate follows from Qt = Tt2α−1 .
Two results can be read directly from equation (13). First, a relative abundance of
Home over Foreign goods lowers Home prices relative to the Foreign (expressed in the
same currency), worsening the Home terms of trade and depreciating its real exchange
rate. If prices of goods are rigid in the endowment currency or if the monetary authority
strictly targets the domestic price level, this corresponds to a nominal depreciation. Under
these assumptions, in what follows, we use terms of trade, real and nominal exchange rates
interchangeably.5

In the model with nominal rigidities the decomposition of the terms of trade into prices and exchange

6

Second, and more important, home bias in consumption is crucial in order for deleveraging to influence the exchange rate. In fact, if preferences are identical across countries
(α = 1/2), the terms of trade are independent of the distribution of wealth and just proportional to the ratio of the endowments of the two goods.6 Instead, when there is home
bias, the distribution of wealth and debt across countries can also affect relative prices
through the demand channel. Imagine that deleveraging in the Home country reduces
Home consumption. Since Home consumers demand more of their own goods, the fall
in Home consumption depresses the demand for Home goods more than that for Foreign
goods. The price of the Home goods relative to Foreign falls, worsening the Home terms
of trade and depreciating the Home currency. In these cases, exchange rate management
is a factor in the debt-deleveraging transmission mechanism. We will study these issues
more extensively in the model with nominal rigidities.

1.1

Steady state

A deleveraging shock produced by a lowering of the debt limit k requires some time to
be absorbed. In this section we abstract from the adjustment process and compare the
initial and final steady-state equilibria. In the steady state, the debt of the borrowers in
country H comes up against the borrowing limit because of their impatience to consume
goods. By contrast, the savers in country H and all the consumers in country F are on
their Euler equations, which link Home and Foreign real interest rates (r̄ and r̄∗ ) to the
subjective discount factor β ∗
(1 + r̄∗ ) = (1 + r̄) =

1
,
β∗

(14)

where an upper bar denotes variables at their steady-state levels. Debt of the borrowers is
determined by the borrowing limit (5), and the steady-state level of consumption follows
from their budget constraint
C̄ b = T̄ α−1 ȲH [1 − (1 − β ∗ )k].

(15)

From the savers’ budget constraint (4), we derive their steady-state consumption
C̄ s = T̄ α−1 ȲH [1 − (1 − β ∗ )d¯s ],

(16)

rate movements will follow naturally from the interaction between price rigidities and monetary policy.

This is a standard result that depends on the assumption of Cobb-Douglas preferences, as in Cole
and Obstfled (1991).

where dst are their outstanding debt obligations as a ratio to GDP (if positive) or assets (if
negative), defined as dst = Dts /(PH,t YH,t ). Note that C̄ s is not determined, since Dts is not
determined. This indeterminacy, standard in open-economy models, is convenient, since
it allows for a degree of freedom to initialize, consistent with the data, the starting point
from which to study the transition path to a new equilibrium. In this new equilibrium, k
is assumed low and d¯s endogenously reaches a new level. Aggregate consumption in the
Home country follows from a weighted average of (15) and (16)
¯
C̄ = T̄ α−1 ȲH [1 − (1 − β ∗ )d],

(17)

where d¯ represents country H’s external liabilities over GDP
d¯ = [θd¯s + (1 − θ)k].
Combining (3), (6) and (12) consumption in the Foreign country is given by
¯
Q̄C̄ ∗ = T̄ α ȲF∗ + T̄ α−1 ȲH (1 − β ∗ )d.

(19)

Interestingly, the terms of trade and the real exchange rate depend on the level of
debt and the distribution of wealth, but only when there is home bias in consumption,
i.e. when α > 1/2. Keeping fixed d¯s when we move from a high- to a low-debt equilibrium
(k falls and d¯ falls), equation (19) shows that the terms of trade improve in the long run.
Indeed, consumption for the constrained borrowers is higher in the final than in the initial
steady state, since they have less debt and can service it at less real cost. On the contrary,
Foreign consumers have to lower consumption. Since there is home bias, the demand for
Home goods increases relative to that of Foreign goods in the long run, the terms of trade
of country H improve and the real exchange rate rises. There is one important caveat,
namely that the level of debt or assets of the savers in country H does not vary during
the exercise.7 However, we will see in the next section that even considering dynamic
adjustment, the response of savers in the Home country does not overturn the reduction
of debt by the constrained agents, so that the total net external debt of the Home country
7

The discussion of this section clearly applies when there are no savers in country H, i.e., θ = 0.

8

is smaller in the new long-run equilibrium. These results characterize the comparison
between the initial steady state and the long run qualitatively. The interesting part of
the exercise, however, is the short-run adjustment, which is completely different in form,
actually swinging from a short-run currency depreciation to a long-run appreciation.

1.2

Adjustment to a deleveraging shock in country H

We now study the dynamic adjustment to a deleveraging shock that hits the borrowers in
country H. Let us say that for exogenous reasons borrowers face a fall in the maximum
amount of debt that can be considered risk-free: the debt ceiling k drops from khigh to
klow . Given an initial condition on the asset position of the savers, ds , the external debt
position of country H with respect to GDP moves from d = θds + (1 − θ)khigh to a new
steady-state level d¯ = θd¯s +(1−θ)klow . The new long-run levels of d¯s and d¯ are determined
along the transition path. The adjustment takes place in two periods, the short run and
the long run.
In the long run, denoted by a bar, the results of section (1.1) apply. The real interest
rate follows from (14) while T̄ , C̄, C̄ ∗ and Q̄ solve equations (3), (13), (17) and (18), and
depend on d¯ = θd¯s + (1 − θ)klow , where d¯s is determined in the adjustment from the short
to the long run.
In the short run, the flow budget constraint of the borrowers in the Home country

The short-run real rate depends on movements in the terms of trade and debt positions
between the short and the long run for a given path of output, which is exogenous and
can be considered constant through the exercise. We have equations (25) and (26) to
determine r, T and d¯s given that T is also a function of d¯s as discussed in the previous
section. The additional equilibrium condition comes from combining (13), (20) and (21)

Some qualitative implications for the short-run terms of trade can be inferred already from
this equation, again assuming home bias in consumption, which is necessary in order for
10

the dynamic and the distribution of debt to affect the terms of trade. When the borrowers
in country H are deleveraging, the savers there increase their debt and d¯s > ds . If in the
¯ is lower than the
new steady state the external debt position of the Home country, d,
initial position, so that overall the country is deleveraging with respect to the world, then
it is easy to see that the terms of trade in the short run, T, will move to a higher level.
Therefore, the exchange rate will come down in the short run but rise in the long run.
For a first assessment of the magnitude of the impact of deleveraging on the world
economy, we calibrate the model assuming that the deleveraging process takes one year. In
the next section, we consider a more general environment in which deleveraging is spread
over several periods, but in a quarterly model. Here, in a yearly model, considering a
steady-state real rate of 2.5% per year we can calibrate β ∗ = 0.9756. We set α = 0.76,
which is consistent with the share of US non-durable consumption spending that goes
to US-made products, as shown in Hale and Hobijn (2011). The initial level of debt
of the borrowers is calibrated to 50% of GDP, implying (1 − θ)khigh = 0.5. This value
corresponds to the level of external liabilities in debt instruments as a ratio to GDP for
the US economy in 2008, according to Gourinchas, Govillot and Rey (2010). The initial
value of θds is chosen to match the US asset position in debt instruments in 2008, equal
to 10% of GDP. The overall net liability position of country H implies, therefore, that d
is set to 40% of GDP as the corresponding position of the US economy in 2008 as regards
debt instruments. We set the share of borrowers in the country equal to 1/3 to imply
θ = 2/3. We imagine alternative scenarios in which the overall debt of the borrowers is
reduced from 50% to 40%, 30% and 20%.
Figure 1 shows the adjustment of Home and Foreign consumption, Home and Foreign
real interest rates, the terms of trade and Home net external liabilities after a deleveraging
shock. The deleveraging of the borrowers in the Home country improves the long-run
external position. External debt is reduced to 36%, 30% or less than 26% in the three
alternative scenarios. As discussed in Section (1.1), the terms of trade improve in the
long run because the Home country reduces its debt exposure and so has more resources
available to buy goods. Since there is home bias in preferences, the demand for domestic
goods rises together with their relative price. In quantitative terms, the Figure shows
that in the long run the appreciation is negligible.
In the short run, the adjustment takes a different direction. Debt-constrained agents
in the Home country must reduce their consumption drastically in order to repay the
debt. Because of home bias, aggregate demand for goods H drops more sharply, so the
terms of trade worsen, implying a sharp depreciation of the Home currency (in Figure
1, the exchange rate falls by as much as 20%). Since in the short run deleveraging

borrowers reduce their demand for goods more than in the long run, the real interest
rate falls, an offsetting factor that generates more consumption by the savers in country
H and by all consumers in country F . The real interest rate falls more in H than in
F, as is shown in equation (24), since the terms of trade (and the real exchange rate)
rise in the short run before falling in the long run. Notice that starting from a real
interest rate of 2.5% the deleveraging shock drives both Home and Foreign rates below
zero; and when deleveraging is severe far below zero, to −10% or more. Overall the
model shows that real interest rates and the terms of trade must move very significantly
to accommodate the deleveraging shock. The adjustment is mitigated by the expansion
of consumption in the foreign economy and by the expenditure-switching effect via the
terms of trade. Any mechanism constraining these relative price movements can produce
a larger fall in Home country consumption. If monetary policy sets too low an inflation
target, the required drop in the real rate in country H will be constrained by the nominal
zero lower bound, absolutely preventing a healthy adjustment. In the next section, we
investigate the implications of the zero lower bound more thoroughly in a model with
nominal rigidities and endogenous production. We will also study alternative exchangerate regimes that can constrain or amplify the adjustment of international relative prices
and optimal monetary policy from a global perspective. In this respect, the important
issue to address is whether the adjustment discussed in this section is optimal or close to
optimal for the global economy.

2

Nominal rigidities

The model described in the previous section shows that relative price movements are
important shock absorbers in the event of deleveraging. Two relative prices in particular
are crucial in the international context: one intratemporal relative price – the terms of
trade – and one intertemporal – the real rate of interest. The terms of trade adjust
through changes in the nominal exchange rate and/or in the prices of the goods produced
in the two countries, while the real interest rate adjusts through changes in the nominal
interest rate and/or the inflation rate. Monetary policy and the exchange-rate regime
matter for the decomposition among these variables. When there are nominal rigidities,
as posited here, they are also important for the dynamic adjustment of the real variables
and in particular for output, which is now endogenous.
Three factors can delay the adjustment and create interesting dynamics. First, nominal
rigidity slows the response of relative prices and can lead to a contraction in real output.
Second, the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate can prevent real rates from
13

falling, depressing aggregate demand and output. Finally, the exchange-rate regime may
either attenuate or amplify the response of real and nominal exchange rates.
The model used in this section closely follows those of the open-economy macro literature, such as Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001, 2005) and Benigno (2009), to which we add
binding borrowing limits. The new elements here with respect to the simple model of
the previous section are nominal rigidities, endogenous output and debt deleveraging on
a longer horizon. Since there is an interesting dynamic here, the debt limit is written in
real terms instead of the ratio debt-to-GDP. In this way debt-to-GDP becomes endogenous and deleveraging may be unsuccessful in the short run if gauged as reduction in the
debt/GDP ratio. On the opposite side, the analysis in the previous section can be read
as successful deleveraging that directly brings down the ratio of the borrowers’ debt to
GDP.
Finally, to simplify exposition and analysis without losing the main mechanisms, we
assume that in country H there are only borrowers. Most important, we set the same
discount factor in the two countries to evaluate intertemporal utility. This assumption
is critical for delivering a tractable analysis of optimal monetary policy from a global
perspective. Indeed, with different discount factors, any possible objective of the central
planner, for some Pareto weights, will not be recursive implying a time-inconsistent optimal policy with all the complications that non-stationary policy rules bring. In fact, with
different discount factors, the central planner gives, at some point, most if not all weight
to the country with higher discount factor. Obviously, in this context, we could assume
that the lower discount factor of savers, although relevant for their choices, is systematically downward biased by behavioral reasons. Therefore the central planner could correct
this bias by using the right discount factor in its objective function. Results of this model
would not differ much from those of the framework presented here.
Given the assumption of same discount factor between the two countries, we assume
that agents in country H are like rule-of-thumb agents which are always constrained in
their financial decision by the borrowing limit.8 The same behavior arises in a model where
agents in country H face a lower discount factor, except that they would choose optimally
to be financially constrained. In both models their consumption is determined by the
flow budget constraint given the maximum amount of debt allowed. The deleveraging
experiment in this section accordingly involves a reduction in country H’s external debt
position. In particular by denoting with zt the real level of debt, zt ≡ Dt /Pt , we are
8

Notice that, since the initial distribution of wealth is not determined, there is no issue of considering
country H as a borrower starting at the borrowing limit in the initial steady state. The problem arises
along the adjustment when the borrowing limit falls. Here we assume that country H stays always at
that limit.

14

interested in a smooth decrease over a certain horizon of this level of debt.
The shortcut used here can be justified by a more general framework in which borrowers in country H indeed optimize intertemporally over their portfolio allocation, but
they face an interest-rate schedule that depends on their level of borrowing in reference
to the ”risk-free” level of debt. One could assume, as in Benigno (2009), that the gross
interest rate faced by borrowers, 1 + ibt is of the form
1+

ibt

 
zt
= (1 + it )φ
z̄t

(27)

where z̄t is the risk-free level of debt and it is the nominal risk-free rate. The function
φ (·) shapes the risk premium for levels of debt exceeding what is considered the riskfree threshold. Our framework with rule-of-thumb borrowers would coincide with a fully
optimizing model for some penalty function φ (·) that implies an endogenous adjustment
along the deleveraging path implied by z̄t . The experiment that we are undertaking here
is clearly one of “benign” deleveraging in which the deleverager reduces smoothly the
level of real debt while facing at the same time favorable risk-free interest rate. Indeed
in equilibrium 1 + ibt = 1 + it .9 Such a framework can be suitable to describe current
deleveraging episodes in US and Europe where unconventional credit-easing policies are
helping to keep risk premia under control.
We could also consider an alternative experiment in which borrowers are instead optimizing intertemporally while facing the schedule (27) and experiencing a sudden rise in
the risk premia because of a fall in the risk-free threshold z̄t . In this case, the intertemporal portfolio allocation, zt , can differ from z̄t during deleveraging entailing variation in
the risk premia. Results on this specification are available upon request.

writing the flow budget constraint of the foreign consumers, we are assuming that the
only international asset traded internationally is a nominal bond denominated in units
of currency of country H. When we consider the monetary-union case, the currencydenomination of debt would clearly not make any difference. But, under the general
two-country model with floating rate, the currency denomination of the debt could be
important for the transmission of the deleveraging shock. We leave further analysis in
this direction to future work.
Turning to the consumer’s optimality conditions, the stochastic version of the Euler
equation (9) still describes the intertemporal allocation of consumption in country F and
holds with equality. Instead, it does not apply to country H.
In both countries there is a continuum of firms, each producing one of the goods.

It follows that pt (h) = PH,t = µWt for each h and p∗t (f ) = PF,t
= µWt∗ for each f ,
where Wt and Wt∗ are aggregate nominal wages in the respective currencies and the
price markup is µ ≡ σ/(σ − 1). While prices are flexible, wages adjust in a staggered
way following Calvo’s model in which unions, grouping work of the same variety, have
monopolistic power in setting wages. In each period, in country H (F ), only a fraction
1 − λ (1 − λ∗ ) of the varieties of labor , with 0 < λ, λ∗ < 1, can have their wages reset
according to the macroeconomic conditions and independently of the last adjustment.
The remaining fraction of varieties of labor, of measure λ (λ∗ ), can only index their wages
to the current inflation target, which does not necessarily coincide with actual inflation.
It is clear that wage rigidity translates directly into price rigidity, since we do not have
productivity shock. The resulting AS equations are standard for this kind of model. The
set of equilibrium conditions is presented in detail in the Appendix.

Optimal policy

In this section we ask how a benevolent central planner maximizing the utility of the world
economy would optimally respond to a deleveraging shock in one of the two countries.
A utility-maximizing framework offers a natural welfare criterion to evaluate alternative
17

policy rules and compute the optimal policy, through the utility of the consumers.
A natural objective for the benevolent central planner is the maximization of the
weighted average of the utility of the consumers in the world economy given by

In particular, we choose appropriately the weight ξ so that the steady state reached
after deleveraging is efficient. Our experiment entails a reduction of debt that brings the
economy from an inefficient allocation to an efficient one. To this end, we assume that
there are appropriate subsidies which eliminate the monopolistic distortions in the labour
markets. The final steady state is described by the following set of equilibrium conditions
¯
C̄ = T̄ α−1 ȲH − (1 − β)Π̄−1 d,
¯
Q̄C̄ ∗ = T̄ α ȲF∗ + (1 − β)Π̄−1 d,
ȲH = T̄ 1−α [αC̄ + (1 − α)Q̄C̄ ∗ ]

ȲHη = C̄ −ρ T̄ α−1
ȲF∗η = (C̄ ∗ )−ρ T̄ 1−α
Q̄ = T̄ 2α−1
which clearly determine the equilibrium allocation for C̄, C̄ ∗ , ȲH , ȲF∗ , Q̄, T̄ given the
level of debt d¯ reached after deleveraging and the steady-state inflation rate in country
H, Π̄.10 The above equilibrium can be implemented through inflation-targeting policies
which target the producer inflation rates in each country at the same rate at which wages
adjust in each period. These policies eliminate also any inefficient wage or price dispersion
due to staggered wages. It is also easy to show that an efficient allocation should satisfy
the condition

which indeed is the one determining the weight ξ given the above derived C̄, C̄ ∗ and Q̄.
The fact that the new steady state is efficient simplifies a lot the analysis. Indeed, by
taking a second-order approximation of (29) around the efficient steady state the resulting

The resulting quadratic objective function can be easily intuited under the special case
of log utility in consumption. In this case, maximization of the above utility function
corresponds to minimization of the following loss function

where now ŶH,t and ŶF,t represents the log deviations with respect to the initial steady
state and yH and yF the log deviations of the final steady state with respect to the initial
one. In particular, initial steady-state output in the Home country is inefficiently high and
therefore yH is negative. Whereas Home steady-state consumption is higher in the final
steady state than in the initial, the terms of trade improve along the two steady states
offsetting the rise in consumption and leading to a lower output. On the contrary, and by
a specular argument, the initial output level in the Foreign country is inefficiently low and
therefore yF∗ is positive. According to the loss function (30), the benevolent central planner
dislikes deviations of the producer inflation rates in each country from their respective
targets. This captures the costs of wage dispersion due to misallocation of labor demand
across varieties which have the same level of efficiency. Moreover deviations of output in
each country from the efficient level are penalized. It is optimal to keep inflation rates at
their targets and at the same time to achieve immediate stabilization of output at the new
efficient level. But this allocation is clearly not feasible and can only be reached in the
long-run, when deleveraging ends. Indeed, policies that keep inflation rates at their target
in each period are not feasible because a deleveraging shock brings the natural real rate of
interest in the negative region and therefore the nominal interest rates should go below zero
violating the zero-lower bound. Moreover, we have also seen that a deleveraging shock
brings the economy in recession and needs a relative price adjustment whose direction

contrasts with the efficient movements of output built into the objective (30), creating
therefore important trade-offs.
Considering a more general preferences’ specification with a non-unitary intertemporal
elasticity of substitution, we solve for the linear-quadratic optimal-policy problem taking
into account the zero-lower bound constraints.11 We analyze the effects of a deleveraging
shock that takes three years to be completed. The model is calibrated quarterly, so the
time of deleveraging, T , is set at 12 quarters. We set β = 0.9938 to imply 2.5% real
annual return on a yearly basis. We set the parameter α = 0.76 as in previous section
and calibrate the parameters σ and τ to 7.66, implying steady-state mark-ups in goods and
labor market equal to 15%. The inverse of the elasticity of substitution in consumption,
ρ, is set to 2, consistent with a number of studies, and the inverse of the labor supply
elasticity, η, is set to 1.5, which is in the range of the estimates of De Walque et al (2005)
in a two-country model of the euro area and the US. The degree of wage rigidities is also
taken from De Walque et al. (2005); λ and λ∗ are set equal to 0.8, which is consistent
with their estimates and implies a duration of wages of 5 quarters in both countries (this
too in line with other micro studies). The upper bound on real debt, zmax , is chosen
such that in the initial steady state it corresponds to a level of net foreign liabilities in
debt instruments equal to 40% of GDP, on an annualized basis, approximately the peak
reached in the US economy in 2008. Given that zmax represents real debt, it should be set
equal to 1.5988.12 We consider a deleveraging that moves zmax to zmin such that in the
final steady state the ratio of external debt liabilities to GDP in the domestic economy
reaches 30%. Deleveraging in our experiment lasts 3 years and involves a proportional
reduction of real debt in each quarter. Real debt is exogenously reduced in each period,
but the path of the debt/GDP ratio is endogenously determined along the adjustment.
When deleveraging begins, agents in the economy know its length and size.13
Figures 2 and 3 show the optimal adjustment under a floating exchange rate and a
monetary union. Let us first focus on the path of the nominal interest rates which are
plotted in Figure 3. Under both cases, optimal policy eventually requires interest rates
to go to the zero lower bound. Under a monetary union, the common interest rate goes
to zero at quarter 6 and remains there until the exact end of deleveraging, quarter 12.
Under the floating exchange-rate regime, the interest rate in country H goes to zero also in
quarter 6, but the interest rate in country F goes to zero after one quarter. This interest
11

See the Appendix for the details.
The value 1.5988 for the real debt zmax , given the steady-state value of GDP, implies an initial value
for debt over GDP of 0.4 when GDP is annualized.

The model solution is non-trivial, considering that deleveraging lasts longer than a quarter and the
zero lower bound may or may not bind. Details are discussed in the Appendix.

rate is the first to exit after quarter 11, while that of country H exits after quarter 13, one
quarter after deleveraging ends. A common characteristic is the sudden and large jump
of the interest rates upon exiting the zero lower bound. This is akin to jumps observed in
other models with zero-lower bounds, see Eggertsson and Woodford (2003). We point out
that the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the zero lower bound is larger just before
exiting implying a more binding constraint at that time. Indeed, if allowed, the nominal
interest rate would be quite negative in the Home country. Notice also that if we were
disregarding the zero-lower bound, under a floating regime, the interest rate of the foreign
country would always remain above zero while the domestic one will be quite negative.
Once we consider the non-negative constraint, both interest rates fall at the zero lower
bound although at different quarters.

nominal interest rates (i,i∗ ), world inflation (π W ), defined as π W = 1/2 · π + 1/2 · π ∗ , the level of the
nominal exchange rate (S); inflation and interest rates are in percents and annual rates.

22

Under a floating exchange-rate regime, upon exiting the zero lower bound, the foreign
interest rate jumps significantly to accommodate a sudden appreciation of the Home
currency. Instead, at the beginning of deleveraging, the home interest rates stay higher
than the foreign to generate a depreciation of the Home currency. The exchange rate
depreciates by around 7 percent and then remains constant until deleveraging ends when
it suddenly appreciates to reach a level below the initial one. The benefits of adjusting the
nominal exchange rate are reflected in a lower variability of the producer inflation rates
in each country. Still, inflation rates cannot remain at the 2% target. Under an optimal
floating exchange-rate regime, the producer inflation rate in the Home country falls first
below 2% and rises after when deleveraging ends. On the opposite, the inflation rate in
country F increases at the beginning of deleveraging. Under fixed rates or a monetary
union, the volatility of inflation rates is higher: inflation reaches 3 % in country F and
falls to 1.5% in country H when deleveraging starts. Inflation then rises substantially
in country H when deleveraging ends. Under this regime, there are more persistent
deviations of the inflation rates from their targets in order to accommodate a more efficient
adjustment of international relative prices. This is also revealed by the path of world
inflation, a weighted average of the CPI inflation of the two countries. At the beginning
of deleveraging inflation rises above target and then falls below, during deleveraging,
before rising back above target when deleveraging ends. World inflation progressively
returns to target in the long run. The swings are amplified under the monetary union,
and coming back to target is slower.
Focusing now on the real economy and on Figure 2, a floating exchange-rate regime is
able to reduce the variability of output and consumption in both countries. In particular,
the worsening of the Home country’s terms of trade produces benefits for production
in country H at the cost of lower foreign output. But, in the medium run, output
rises significantly in country F driven by the depreciation of the foreign currency. The
movements in the terms of trade under the floating regime are able to redistribute more
appropriately the costs of deleveraging across the two countries mitigating the recession in
country H during deleveraging through a contraction in the foreign economy. Since under
a fixed rate the terms of trade adjust sluggishly, consumption has to vary more to reduce
the costs of deleveraging and in particular consumption in country F rises substantially
while remains more depressed in the Home economy. Notice that when deleveraging ends,
under both regimes, there is a consumption boom in country H due to the substantial
fall in the real rate which reduces significantly the borrowing costs. After that period,
deleveraging ends and consumers can devote more resource to consumption and at the
same time enjoy a lower level of debt and lower costs of servicing it.

Inflation targeting under a monetary union

In this section, we further elaborate on the monetary-union case. We have shown that,
although the exchange rate is fixed, the deleveraging shock can be absorbed through
larger movements in the inflation rates in the two country. We compare the optimal
policy with a symmetrical inflation-targeting policy in which monetary policy is set to
maintain the average CPI inflation in the area at 2% when possible. The first result is
that an inflation-targeting policy so defined is not feasible since the nominal interest rate
goes into the negative territory. Therefore, we have to modify the policy allowing for a
zero interest rate until the time in which the inflation-targeting policy implies a positive
nominal interest rate

The exit time T1 from the zero lower bound is endogenously determined. Results are
showed in Figures 4 and 5 in comparison with the optimal policy. The minimum stays at
the zero lower bound is until quarter 12 and exiting is at quarter 13. Under a sub-optimal
inflation-targeting policy, the Home country experiences a subdued inflation rate during
deleveraging, while the inflation rate in the Foreign country does not exceed much the
target but falls when deleveraging ends. The nominal interest rate jumps above its longrun value when deleveraging ends, while under optimal policy converges from below. To
keep inflation at the target, monetary policy should be more contractionary. This comes
at the cost of a larger contraction or mitigated expansion in both consumption and output
for the two countries, as shown in Figure 4.
The path of the average inflation rate in the currency area is also illustrative of the
differences between the optimal and the inflation-targeting regimes. Under inflation targeting, union inflation can be at the target only after quarter 12. However union inflation
substantially falls during deleveraging, even if monetary policy is accommodative through
a zero interest-rate policy. Overall, an inflation-targeting policy is too contractionary delivering too much costs in terms of output and consumption. Interestingly, during the
deleveraging period and under optimal policy, the union inflation rate is much closer on
average to the target than under the strict inflation targeting policy. This is because
optimal policy allows union inflation to increase above 2% both at the beginning and at
the end of the deleveraging period. On the contrary, under the strict inflation targeting
policy, the average inflation during the deleveraging episode is necessarily below 2% and
overall policy is much more contractionary.

Alternative monetary policies

Now, we discuss alternative monetary policies seeking to determine the features that
mitigate or aggravate the recession that necessarily follows deleveraging in comparison
with optimal policy. To save space, we base the analysis here on the monetary union.

5.1

A prolonged stay at the zero lower bound

Our benchmark inflation-targeting regime of the previous section assumed that the exit
time was the earliest at which regular policies would imply non-negative interest rates.
But interest rates can stay at the zero lower bound for longer than this. In this section,
we study how the equilibrium changes when exit is delayed. In particular we consider
delays from one to two quarters with respect to the benchmark exit time at T1 = 13
discussed in Figures 4 and 5. The results are shown in Figures 6 and 7. The equilibrium
is very sensitive to any lengthening, even by just one quarter, the stay at the zero lower
bound. On the positive side, a longer stay can mitigate the costs of deleveraging and
actually produce a substantial expansion in country F . The fall in the real interest rate
is faster and more protracted, alleviating the cost of deleveraging in the country H and
stimulating more consumption in F . On the negative side, too long stay can cause rapid
inflation in both countries, with significant and prolonged overshooting of the 2% target.
Since deleveraging ends in quarter 12, the analysis suggests that exiting from the zero
lower bound as earlier as possible can lower the costs of deleveraging without missing the
inflation target by much.
The analysis also suggests that the equilibrium is highly sensitive to even small variations in the policies that act on demand. This is because this model, like Eggertsson and
Krugman (2012), has a sort of upward sloping demand equation for the world economy,
so that changes in demand may produce larger shifts in the equilibrium.14

5.2

Mistaken policies

Going to the zero lower bound is a policy option, not a requirement. If the natural
rate of interest falls, policymakers may counteract the deleveraging-induced recession by
expansionary monetary policy, that drives nominal interest rates to zero. In the previous
section, we studied the benefits of these policies even over long time horizons.
However, monetary policymakers may be reluctant to push zero interest rates to this
14

Indeed, if we increase the flexibility of wages, the reaction is even larger as in the ”paradox of
flexibility” described in Eggertsson and Krugman (2012).

limit. Let us accordingly look at what happens when policymakers are blocked by worrying
about lowering interest rates too far. This experiment sheds light on the adjustment of
economies in which even if the policy rate is low borrowing and lending rates are high owing
to credit market malfunctioning. In this section, starting from our benchmark of fixed
exchange rates we study the equilibrium in which nominal interest rates are kept constant
until time T1 but at a higher level, 1% or 3%. Figures 8 and 9 show how costly these
mistaken polices can be in terms of the recession’s depth and duration. The contraction
of consumption in country H can be deep indeed, like the contraction of output in both
economies. For example, when nominal interest rates are kept at 3% the real rate rises
well above normal levels in both countries because deflation is sharp. Inflation enters
into the negative territory. Consumption falls by two or even three times as much as
in the benchmark case. Interestingly, when the interest rate is kept high consumption
falls substantially in country F as well, worsening the recession in both economies. In
fact, they can slip into a deep, prolonged deflation-recession mode with excessively high
real interest rates. In the short run, because of the contraction in nominal spending,
deleveraging results in overshooting the desirable level of the country’s external debt,
reaching as high as 47% of GDP. Slowly debt comes to its new steady-state level.
Where higher interest rates are a symptom of credit market malfunctioning due to
widespread illiquidity problems and risk of bank defaults, this analysis suggests that the
sort of credit-easing policies followed by many central banks during the recent financial
crisis can reduce the costs of deleveraging by narrowing spreads and restoring normal flow
in credit markets.

Conclusion

We have examined the international implications of debt deleveraging in one country
within the world economy or a monetary union and studied how monetary policy should
be set at the global level. Deleveraging reduces aggregate demand and may lead to
recession, as economic agents save to repay the debt. There are interesting international
spillovers through trade and the exchange rate. A smooth adjustment requires movements
in two relative prices; namely the exchange rate and the real interest rate. The exchange
rate, which is an international relative price, should move in such a way as to rebalance
resources across countries. The deleveraging country’s currency will depreciate in the short
run and appreciate in the long-run. This depends critically on home bias in consumers’
preferences. Since in the short run agents who are paying down their debt have less
resources for consumption, the price of home goods should fall relative to the foreign, and
32

a fall in the exchange rate will assist this adjustment. Once the debt has been repaid,
however, agents have more resources to spend and in particular on domestic goods. The
other important relative price in the adjustment, the real interest rate, will come down
and fall more sharply in the deleveraging country.
In this study, we have concentrated on the role of monetary policy and alternative
exchange-rate regimes in mitigating or amplifying the costs of debt deleveraging. The zero
lower bound on nominal interest rates is a significant constraint in our analysis, because
the natural rate of interest falls substantially. Floating exchange rates help ease the
recession, whereas under a monetary union international relative prices move sluggishly
and inflation is much more volatile. In this case, the deleveraging country experiences
subdued inflation during deleveraging and higher inflation when deleveraging ends. We
have also shown that alternative times of exit from the zero lower bound can have a major
impact on real economy, as can mistaken policies of keeping interest rates too high for
too long.
We have analyzed a very simple two-country open-economy model. The consequent
limitations are essentially the price paid for the simplifications used. First of all, the
debt constraint in this model is exogenous and deleveraging is interpreted as a progressive
lowering of this limit. It would clearly be interesting to have more endogeneity along these
dimensions, but this limitation is shared with other recent works in the field. Second, in
the real world debt deleveraging affects a variety of agents in the economy: households,
banks, firms and governments. Distinguishing them in the model would enhance realism
and possibly enable us to differentiate the effects of deleveraging on the economy according
on which agents are paying down their debt. It is likely that, however, the qualitative
results implied by our simple framework would hold also in a more complex context.
Finally, the asset market structure has been kept very simple – only one asset traded
internationally. This is a significant limitation, since the portfolio position of a country is
much more complex and diversified involving assets and liabilities, in different currencies
and instruments ranging from equity to debt. This is an interesting avenue for future
research.

Model Solution

In the exercises of Section 4, the model is solved given the monetary policies specified in
the text and the processes of the exogenous disturbances. One of these exogenous variable
is zt , the debt limit, which is assumed to follow the process
zt = zt−1 − vt
where vt = v for 1 ≤ t ≤ T, and vt = 0 for t > T . In particular v measures the amount
of deleveraging per quarter during the deleveraging period and T is the length of the
period in quarters. To study the policy experiments discussed in the main text, it is also
convenient to add three more exogenous state variables. In particular, when the nominal
interest rate is targeted either to zero or to some other value, we add the exogenous state
variable ı̄t , such that 1 + it = 1 +ı̄t for 1 ≤ t < T1 , where T1 denotes the time at which the
economy exits from interest-rate targeting or from the zero lower bound. In particular,
we assume a process for the new exogenous state variable of the form
1 + ı̄t = (β)−1 Π̄ − εt
where εt = ε for 1 ≤ t < T1 and ε measures the reduction needed to bring the nominal
interest rate down from the steady-state to the desired level.
We add also the exogenous state π̄H,t which is used in Section 5 in studying the effects
of inflation-targeting policy with a high target starting from time T1 to T2 . In particular,
38

in this case, inflation (in logs) in country H is set to πH,t = π̄H,t where π̄H,t = π̄H,high for
T1 ≤ t < T2 and π̄H,t = π̄ for t ≥ T2 . Therefore we write a process for π̄H,t of the form
π̄H,t = π̄ + ut
where ut = π̄H,high − π̄H for T1 ≤ t < T2 and ut = 0 for t ≥ T2 . Finally, in Section ??,
under the flexible-exchange-rate policy, the exchange rate falls in the first period by the
t
factor γt , so that SSt−1
= 1 + γt . We add γt as a state variable with the following process
γt = γ̄t
where γ̄t = γ for t = 1, conditional on the floating-exchange-rate regime, and γ̄t = 0 for
t > 1.
Notice that for t ≥ T2 and for any of the policies considered in the text, all the
”shocks” are zero, i.e. vt = εt = ut = γ̄t = 0. Therefore the model described in the
previous section together with the processes for (ı̄t π̄H,t , γt , zt ) outlined above (considering
vt = εt = ut = γ̄t = 0), given the policy rules specified in the text, can be written in the
compact form
Et F (yt , yt+1 ; xt , xt+1 ) = 0
where yt collects the endogenous non-predetermined variables while xt collects the state
variables including the endogenous state variables x1,t and the exogenous state variables
x2,t = (ı̄t π̄H,t , γt , zt ). Note that the function F depends on the policy rules posited and
is a vector of functions of dimension equal to the sum of the dimension of yt and xt .
Therefore, for t ≥ T2 , in a log-linear approximation, the solution will be of the form
ŷt = F1 x̂1,t−1 + F2 x̂2,t−1

(B.1)

x̂1,t = V1 x̂1,t−1 + V2 x̂2,t−1

(B.2)

x̂2,t = M2 x̂2,t−1
for well-defined matrices F1 , F2 , V1 , V2 where M2 is a square matrix of zeros except for a
one in the last element of the last row and hats denote log-deviation with respect to the
steady state.
Instead, for periods 1 ≤ t < T2 the model described above can be written compactly
as
Et F̃t (yt , yt+1 ; xt , xt+1 ) = 0
(B.3)

39

where the vector of functions might now depend on time and be different across subperiods depending on the policy rules posited: for example, whether the system is or
is not at the zero lower bound. Moreover, the dimension of F̃t is now the sum of the
dimension of yt and x1,t since we are not adding the processes for the exogenous state
variables. It can be shown that in a log-linear approximation the above system implies
the following restriction
A1 Et ŷt+1 + A2 x̂1,t = B1,t ŷt + B2,t x̂1,t−1 + B3,t x̂2,t

(B.4)

for well-defined matrices A1 , A2 , B1,t , B2,t B3,t where only B1,t , B2,t B3,t depend on the
policy regime posited. For the period 1 ≤ t < T2 we can write the processes for the
exogenous state variables generically as
x̂2,t = M2 x̂2,t−1 + mε,t εt + mv,t vt + mu,t ut + mγ,t γ̄t

(B.5)

where the shocks vt , εt , ut , γ̄t are constant or zero depending on the specification of the
policy considered and the vectors mε,t , mv,t , mu,t , mγ,t are eye vectors (with a unitary
element in correspondence with the respective shock) when the respective shock is constant
otherwise are zero vectors.
For period 1 ≤ t < T2 , the solution has the form

where for a generic variable X, X̂ denotes the log deviations with respect to the initial

steady-state (before deleveraging) and x denotes the log difference between the final and
initial steady state. Note that under the assumption ρ = 1 we retrieve the loss function
discussed in the main text (30) for defined parameters ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , ϕ4 .
The objective function is now quadratic and can be appropriately evaluated by a loglinear approximation of the constraints around the initial steady state. By taking an
approximation of the model equilibrium conditions presented in the above section in the
Appendix, we respectively get

Optimal policy solves the maximization of (C.10) under the above-defined constraints,
taking into account the two zero-lower-bound constraints. The equilibrium conditions of
the optimal policy problem can be written in the general form (B.3) and therefore similar
steps to those described in that section are used to solve for the response of the endogenous
variables to the deleveraging shocks.
