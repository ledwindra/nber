    "abstract": "\n\nWe exploit the natural experiment provided by the Vietnam lottery draft to evaluate the intergenerational effect of fathers\u2019 draft eligibility on children\u2019s propensity to engage in risky health behaviors during adolescence using the NLSY97. Draft eligibility increases measures of substance use, intensity of use, decreases age of initiation\u2014particularly for marijuana\u2014and increases measures of delinquency. We explore potential mechanisms: Draft eligibility affects paternal parenting styles and attitudes towards the respondent, environmental aspects, and even maternal factors. Results are robust to alternative specifications and falsification diagnostics. Our results indicate that previous analyses underestimate the full negative effects of draft eligibility.\n\n",
