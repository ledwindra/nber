Intrinsic Openness and Endogenous Institutional Quality
Yang Jiao and Shang-Jin Wei
NBER Working Paper No. 24052
November 2017
JEL No. F1,O1
ABSTRACT
Quality of public institutions has been recognized as a crucial determinant of macroeconomic
outcomes. We propose that a country's intrinsic level of openness (due to population size,
geography, or exogenous trade opportunities) affects its incentives in investing in better
institutions. We present a simple theory and extensive empirical evidence validating the role of
intrinsic openness in determining governance quality. This suggests an indirect but important
channel for globalization to improve welfare by raising the quality of governance.

Introduction

Institutional quality (e.g., level of bureaucratic corruption, political risk premium, quality of government service, and risk of expropriation) varies widely
across countries. It has been regarded as a crucial determinant of a countrys
economic performance. Mauro (1995) nds that corruption lowers investment,
thus growth rate. Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny (1991) argue that rent-seeking
activities are detrimental to growth rate. Institutional quality can also a¤ect
how economic gains are distributed. Chong and Calderson (2000) nd a negative relationship between institutional quality and income inequality. With open
economy consideration, Wei (2000) empirically shows that corruption reduces
a countrys inward FDI. Tamirisa and Wei (2000) show that corruption also
deters international trade signi cantly. Besides, institutional quality is found
to a¤ect international trade patterns. Costinot (2009), Levchenko (2007) and
Vogel (2007) consider institutional quality as an independent source of comparative advantage. Ju and Wei (2011) conclude that institutional quality a¤ects
patterns of both capital ows and trade.
Given the signi cance of institutional quality, it is important to understand
its determinants. We argue in this paper that a countrys intrinsic openness,
as given by its population size and geography, is a determinant of institutional
quality. The central story is as follows. The amount of resources that a society
devotes to building good institutions is endogenous; and depends on a comparison of marginal cost and marginal bene t. Since international traders and
investors are more footloose (i.e., have better outside options) than domestic
ones, bad governance and bureaucratic corruption in a country reduces international trade and investment more than domestic trade and investment. As a
result, a country that is intrinsically more open  based on its population size,
geography, and other factors outside its control  would nd it more costly if they
su¤er from bad institutions so they optimally devote more resources to building
good institutions. Such economies will display, for example, less corruption and
a higher quality of government than intrinsically less open economies.
We will check the plausibility of some key assumptions in our story. For example, do bad institutions reduce international trade more than domestic trade?
This would require a way to estimate a countrys trade with itself. By using
gross output decomposition data from the recent literature on the measurement
of global value chains, we can perform such a test and nd supportive evidence.
We also empirically con rm that, across countries, intrinsic openness (smaller
size, shorter distance to the world market, not landlocked, or longer coastline
length/area) does lead to greater actual trade openness (trade/GDP).
Importantly, we test and nd strong support for the key proposition of our
theory: An increase in a countrys intrinsic openness indeed reduces corruption,
improves government quality, and decreases political risk. In the same exercise,
we also nd some support for the notion that colonial settlers mortality rate
in the 18th and 19th century, and abundance of natural resources tend to be
associated with worse institutions. We do not nd robust support for a role of
legal origins in determining institutional quality.

Because institutional quality is a slow-moving variable, much of our results
will be based on cross-country variations in a given year (2005 is our base year,
though we have veri ed that the same results hold for other years). By necessity,
one cannot control for country xed e¤ects in pure cross-country regressions.
This is not unusual for the literature on this topic. For example, Acemoglu,
Johnson, and Robinson (2001) and Leite and Weidmann (1999) report only
cross-sectional results in testing their theories of settler mortality and natural
resource endowment, respectively, as determinants of institutional quality. Since
our measures of a countrys intrinsic openness are geographic features (such as
distance to major economic centers of the world, or coastal length relative to
area size) and population size, they are unlikely to be endogenous outcomes of
institutional quality. There is therefore less need to worry about endogeneity in
our setting than a typical cross-country regression.
Nonetheless, we will also attempt a long-di¤erence exercise by exploring exogenous variations in the level of intrinsic openness experienced by small and
medium-sized countries during 2000-2006. A major shock to the global trading
environment during that period was Chinas accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, and a dramatic and unilateral reductions in Chinas trade
barriers on imports from the rest of the world. While Chinas GDP roughly doubles once every seven years, Chinas trade roughly doubles once every four years.
Given the size of the Chinese market, its cut in import tari¤ implies a signi cant
and exogenous change in many countries overall trading opportunities. Importantly, the changes to intrinsic openness are uneven across countries, partly
because of di¤erences in geography (e.g., countries near China might bene t
more than those that are far away), and partly because of di¤erences in comparative advantage (e.g., a big reduction in Chinese tari¤ on automobiles means
di¤erent things for car-exporting countries versus non-car-exporting countries).
While changes in the Chinese tari¤ rates were the primary shock, changes
in tari¤s by other major economies during the same period could matter as
well. In our long-di¤erence exercise, we employ changes in import tari¤s by
big trading nations (China + G7) from 2000 to 2006 as a source of exogenous
shock to other countries intrinsic openness. A key nding will be that greater
improvement in governance quality (greater reduction in political risks) is found
in those countries that experienced greater relative increase in intrinsic openness.
Various robustness checks such as excluding outliers, using 3-year averages, and
implementing placebo-tests con rm robustness of our conclusions.
A third type of empirical exercise we do explores cross-product heterogeneity
in the reliance on governance institutions. Nunn (2007) makes the point that
the same improvement in public institutions might have a greater salubrious effect on the production and trade of what he calls "contract-intensive" products
(which are empirically proxied by di¤erentiated goods such as numerically controlled machines) than on "less contract intensive" goods (which are empirically
proxied by relatively "homogenous" goods such as iron, steal, and oil). We build
on this insight and ask the reverse question: do countries whose comparative
advantage is in contract intensive products respond more in governance quality
to a given change in intrinsic openness? We nd that the answer is a resounding
3

yes, and take it as a further con rmation of our theory.
We compare our story with the existing literature on the determinants of
institutional quality. Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) propose that the
mortality rate of the European colonizers in the past is a key determinant of a
developing countrys institutional quality today. By their logic, a higher colonial
mortality rate translates into a stronger incentive to set up extractive institutions with less protection for property rights during the colonial years, and the
nature of institutions tends to live on even after independence. Engelman and
Sokolo¤ (2002) use the initial factor endowment as an explanation for the difference in institutional quality in the Americas. La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and
Shleifer (2008) hypothesize that a common law origin is more protective of outside investors than the civil law tradition. Leite and Weidmann (1999) argue
that natural resource abundance is related to more rent seeking behavior, resulting in lower economic growth. None of these explanations is based explicitly
on open economy concerns.
At least three other papers make a connection between trade and institutional quality. Ades and Di Tella (1999) argue that greater trade openness
reduces the amount of rent associated with being in the government and hence
reduces the level of corruption. In their theory, the sign of competitiveness effect on corruption is ambiguous. In their empirical part, they nd that a higher
import/GDP ratio reduces the level of corruption. Our cross sectional results
will show that, after controlling for the import/GDP ratio, there is still ample evidence supporting the role of intrinsic openness in a¤ecting institutional
quality. In our framework, it is the intrinsic openness not the actual openness (trade/GDP) that can a¤ect institutional quality. When we let intrinsic
openness and residual openness - the part of import/GDP that is not related
to geography and country size - compete in explaining institutional quality, intrinsic openness dominates residual openness. In addition, we will explore a
natural experiment in which institutional quality responds to changes in export
opportunities due to policy changes of partner countries rather than in import
competition.
Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2005) attribute part of Western Europes
development after 1500 to institutional improvement after the increase of the
Atlantic trade. Because the Atlantic trade enriched merchants, their political
demand - stronger protection of property rights - became better met. In comparison, while we also look at the role of trade globalization, we do not rely on
changes in political power but di¤erential sensitivity between international and
domestic trade to a given change in institutional quality.
For Levchenko (2013), the mechanism for institutional changes is a race to
the top: when the technology di¤erence between two countries is small, after
opening to trade, countries upgrade institutional quality in order to specialize
in institutionally intensive sectors to extract rents in that sector. But when
the technology di¤erence is large enough, the opposite pattern happens - institutional quality deteriorates in order to extract more rents. Therefore, trade
openness helps institutional quality only locally. In comparison, we regard bad
institutional quality as a tax on trade, and endogenous upgrading of institu4

tional quality is driven by the di¤erence in the e¤ects of institutional quality on
international versus trade. In addition, while Levchenko (2013) provides only
cross sectional regressions, this paper will also conduct long-di¤erence analysis
(that di¤erences out country xed e¤ects).
The current paper is also related to a growing literature on a "China shock"
in trade. Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013), Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson and
Price (2016) and Pierce and Schott (2016) study e¤ects of increased Chinas
import competition during 2000-2007 on US local labor markets. Bloom, Draca
and Van Reenen (2015) show that o¤shoring to China may have bene ted European rms and their workers by enhancing rms productivity and innovation
activities. Autor, Dorn, Hanson, Mailesi (2016) analyze the role of growing imports from China during 2000-2007 in shaping the polarization of U.S. politics.
Wang, Wei, Yu, and Zhu (2017) suggest, once using a supply chain perspective,
the negative e¤ects on the US labor market of a China trade shock could be
reversed.
Similar to other papers on the China trade shock, some of the empirical
exercises in this paper also take advantage of the changes in global trading environment during 2000-2006 that was related to Chinas accession to the WTO.
Di¤erent from the existing literature on the China trade shock, we focus on
its e¤ect on institutional changes in other countries. Our results suggests an
indirect but important bene cial channel for Chinas rise in word trade: by responding to the changes in the global trading environment by improving their
public institutions, many countries growth prospect in the long run may be
brightened. This could be especially important for countries with a low initial
level of institutional quality.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose a
simple theory clarifying the logic behind the story. In Section 3, we supply crosssectional evidence on the relationship between a countrys intrinsic openness
and its institutional quality. In Section 4, we conduct a long-di¤erence analysis
exploring exogenous changes in intrinsic openness experienced by small and
medium sizd economies during 2000-2006 due to changes in trade barriers by
China and G7 countries. We will also explore cross-product heterogeneity in
the reliance on public governance institutions. Finally, in Section 5, we provide
concluding remarks and suggest some possible future research. A set of ve
appendices provide more information on data sources, supplementary empirical
work verifying some key assumptions of the theory, and an extension of the
model.

2.1

The Model
Model Setup

Consider a world with N countries. Country i has a population of Li and
a technology level denoted by Ai . This yields total units of e¤ective labor
Ei = Ai Li . Each unit of e¤ective labor produces one unit of good (either a

5

homogeneous or a di¤erentiated good).
A representative consumer in country i has the following logarithmic utility1 :
ui = log Hi
with Hi denoting the consumption of the nal good, which comes from
Hi = Yi Xi1

(1)

where 0 < < 1. Yi is an internationally traded homogeneous good, and Xi is
an Armington aggregate of di¤erentiated goods from each country described as
below:
X
1

Nj Xij ) 1
Xi = (
j2N

where Xij is the consumption of a di¤erentiated good produced by country j
and consumed in country i, and Nj the number of varieties produced in country
j. We assume Nj is positively related to the producing countrys population:
Nj = M (Lj )2 . Parameter  > 1 is the elasticity of substitution.
The homogeneous good is taken as the numeraire thus pY = 1. Since it is
tradable across countries, the wage rate of a unit of e¤ective labor is pinned
down by wi = 13 . Assuming a complete competitive market for each variety,
the fob price of each variety must be pi = wi = 1. Denoting the nal good price
as Pi , the pro t maximization problem of nal good producers is

The iceberg trade cost for a given country pair (i, j),  ij , is assumed to
depend on the quality of institutions in the two countries, as well as geographic
1 The logarithmic utility is for ease of exhibition. All theoretical results apply as long as
utility is an increasing function of nal good consumption, as one can always equivalently
transform the objective function for welfare by a monotonic increasing function.
2 This shares a feature with the Krugman (1979) model in which the (endogenous) number
of varieties is proportional to the population size. For simplicity, we assume a competitive
good market. However, our theoretical predictions are preserved if we adopt the monopolistic
competition framework of Krugman (1979).

(e.g. corruption) add to the cost of clearing the customs or uploading or o­oading cargos. We specify the following separable functional form for the iceberg
cost:
 ij = dij f (qi ; qj )
(5)
where the rst term dij reects physical distance and (bilateral) trade policy,
and the second term (qi ; qj ) captures the role of the two countries institutional
qualities.
Note that bad institutional quality negatively impacts both domestic and
international trade.

That is to say, international trade is more sensitive to domestic institutional

The above two assumptions are crucial for the theoretical predictions. In an
appendix, we empirically verify these assumptions using an augmented gravity
framework. A key ingredient is to measure a countrys trade with itself. See
Appendix A2 for details.

2.2

Institutional Cost

We now investigate the endogenous determination of institutional quality. To
capture the idea that improving institutional quality requires costly investment,
we specify a cost function in per capita terms such that the per capita income
in the economy net of investment in public institutions is:
Aei = [1

(qi )]Ai

where 0(qi ) > 0 so that it is costly to upgrade institutional quality5 .

one variable qi :
5 Note that the requirement investment in public institutions is assumed to exhibit no scale
e¤ect. In Appendix A4, we use cross-country data to con rm that neither general government
expense per capita nor total government employee compensation per capita exhibits a scale
e¤ect. One reason might be that, as a country becomes larger, the number of layers of
goverments tends to increase as well.

7

This implies a tradeo¤ for any country: on one hand, better institutional quality
leads to less resource spent on consumption; on the other hand, it reduces
transaction costs in trade.

2.3

Optimal Institutional Quality

The optimal institutional quality can be solved from the viewpoint of a social
planner, who faces the following problem:

The left hand side is the marginal cost of increasing one unit of institutional
quality while the right hand side is the marginal bene t. To guarantee uniqueness, we assume that the left hand side is increasing in qi (convex cost of increasing institutional quality), while the right hand side is decreasing in qi (diminishing returns to institutional quality). At least one of the two is assumed to be

strictly monotonic. For example, (q) = 1 e
; f (q i ; q j ) = e qi e qj ; f (q i ; q i ) = e qi ;
where  i >.
Following the existing trade literature, and for notational convenience, we
set dii = 1. The rst order condition can be re-written as

Before we proceed to the role of intrinsic openness in determining institutional quality, we note that if institutional quality were to a¤ect international

, then the second

irrelevant for determining institutional quality.
Assume that f (qi ; qj ), i 6= j is separable (log-additive6 , or in a two-country
setting: home and rest of the world, we dont need this assumption.)
f (qi ; qj ) = f1 (qi )f2 (qj ).
6 In the Appendix, when we test gravity equation with institutional quality, if we include
an interaction term qi  qj , it is hard to reject the coe¢cient before the interaction term is 0.

See Figure 1 for a numerical example of equilibrium determination. Conducting
comparative statics o¤ers the following insights.
Proposition 1 (Population) Holding everything else equal, a smaller country
(smaller Ni ) chooses to invest in better institutional quality.
Proof. The second term of the right hand side increases when Ni decreases.
Therefore, the marginal return from better institutional quality goes up. In equilibrium, smaller Ni country displays higher institutional quality qi .
Proposition 2 (Geography) Holding everything else equal, a country that is
nearer to the rest of the world economy (smaller dij ) tends to choose better
institutional quality.
Proof. The second term of the right hand side increases when dij decreases.
Therefore, the marginal return from better institutional quality goes up. In equilibrium, smaller dij country displays higher institutional quality qi .
The intuition of the above two propositions is as follows: the welfare of an
intrinsically more open country (with either a smaller Ni or a smaller dij ) has
a larger part coming from international trade. As international trade is more
sensitive to institutional quality compared to domestic trade, bad institutional
quality will do more damage to such a country. Therefore, an intrinsically more
open economy has a stronger incentive to improve institutional quality.
Corollary (Globalization) Trade liberalization facilitates institutional quality upgrading.
Proposition 3 (Complementarity) Improvement in foreign institutional quality induces improvement in domestic institutional quality.
Proof. County j institutional upgrading decreases f (qi ; qj ) thus also increases
the second term of the right hand side. In equilibrium, higher qj increases qi .
Since those foreign countries that are geographically close have a bigger
weight in a countrys trade, the above proposition would generate spatial correlation in institutional quality. That is, one tends to see a cluster of adjacent
countries with similar quality of institutions.
The assumption that international trade is more sensitive to institutional
quality compared to domestic trade is crucial. If we were to reverse this assumption, Proposition 1-3 would have been reversed too. As we show in Appendix
A2, data supports the assumption that international trade is more sensitive to
institutional quality than domestic trade.

2.4

Political Economy Considerations

The previous propositions are derived from a social planners optimization problem. Without heterogeneity across agents in a country, everyone would make the
same choice as the social planner. To highlight the potential conict of interest
across agents in selecting the quality of institutions, we now introduce capital
(as another exogenous element of endowment, in the spirit of the HeckscherOhlin model of trade) and inequality of capital endowment. Inequality of capital among individuals or households has been emphasized in the Piketty (2013)
book on income inequality.
Suppose the economy has total capital Ki where agent s in country i holds kis
and is endowed with a unit of labor as before. Household utility is still assumed
to be
ui = log Hi
where Hi is the consumption of nal good. The
revised to
Hi = Yi Mi1

nal good consumption is

with Yi the consumption of freely traded homogeneous good and Mi produced
by using domestic capital Ki and di¤erentiated good Xij from country j. A
continuum of Mi producers master the following production technology

Mi = Ki [(
j2N

Since Mauro (1995) nds that corruption reduces investment rate, we interpret
it as evidence that bad institutions damage capital returns, although we do not
model explicitly capital accumulation. To represent this idea, we assume that
bad institutional quality imposes a tax on capital income. Formally, good Mi

where Ri is the return to capital owners but  K

i will be a function of institutional quality just as  ij .
The total income of the economy is the sum of capital income and labor
income

Intuitively, when capital is scarce (large K

the other hand, if the iceberg cost (i.e.  i ) is high, the capital return is low.

Therefore, if to obtain a given level of institutional quality qi , each agent needs to

Inspecting the last term of the equation above reveals that a larger Ki =L

a higher marginal return from improving institutional quality. This translates
into a preference for better institutional quality.
Because lower institutional quality reduces capital returns, agents with a
higher level of capital endowment su¤er more from a given level of poor institutional quality. Suppose institutional quality is determined by the median
voter, then higher inequality of capital endowment across individuals reduces the
median voters capital endowment, which leads to worse institutional quality.
Formally,

Proof. The decrease in the ratio of median voter capital to average capital shifts
down the marginal bene t line of institutional quality.

Cross-Sectional Evidence

We now turn to empirical evidence, staring with cross-country data patterns.
We rst look at whether the intrinsic openness explains the institutional quality
across countries. These are the key predictions of our story. In this part, we
also add various controls which are shown to help explain institutional quality
in the existing literature.
We also add inequality of income (Gini coe¢cient) as a regressor. This is
meant to serve two purposes: (a) to check if the data patterns are consistent
with the prediction of the political economy extension of the model, and (b)
to check if the relationship between intrinsic openness and institutional quality
survives after one controls for income inequality. An important caveat is that
we do not have an instrumental variable for the Gini coe¢cient, so this part of
the evidence should be treated only as suggestive.

Data Description

For cross-sectional evidence, we choose the values of institutional quality and
other variables in 2005. In general, institutional quality is persistent (the relative
ranks across countries exhibit strong persistence). Thus, for cross sectional
regressions, it does not matter much which speci c year one takes. Year 2005
is chosen so that the key variables are available for a relatively large number of
countries.
We drop countries with fewer than 0.5 million population because data quality is often poor for very small countries and measurement errors could be large7 .
We also use two di¤erent thresholds: 0.2 million or 1 million, and nd that our
main results are robust.
Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the variables used in the regressions. We are left with 150 economies although not every country has data for
all variables. We explain the data in detail below.
3.1.1

Institutional Quality Measures

We use ve measures of institutional quality: (1) political risk index from International Country Risk Guide, abbreviated as ICRG, (2) the corruption perception index from Transparency International, abbreviated as TI, (3) control of
corruption from the World Banks World Governance Indicators, abbreviated as
WGI, and (4) government e¤ectiveness from WGI8 , (5) expropriation risk, which
is the Investment Pro le component of the political risk index. All indices are
constructed in such a way that a higher score means better institutional quality.
The political risk index takes on a value between 0 and 100, and is meant
to capture eleven aspects of a countrys institutional quality: (A) Government
7 We further drop Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, South Sudan, East Timor, and North and
South Sudan, as these relatively new countries have a short history and potentially less reliable
data. We drop West Bank and Gaza Strip because of a lack of reliable data.
8 WGI has 6 measures of institutional quality. Other measures such as rule of law and
regulatory quality suggest similar empirical results, and are omitted to save space.

12

Stability, a maximum of 12 points; (B) Socioeconomic Conditions, 12 points;
(C) Investment Pro le, 12 points; (D) Internal Conict, 12 points; (E) External Conict, 12 points; (F) Corruption, 6 points; (G) Military in Politics, 6
points; (H) Religious Tensions, 6 points; (I) Law and Order, 6 points; (J) Ethnic
Tensions, 6 points; (K) Democratic Accountability, 6 points; (L) Bureaucracy
Quality, 4 points9 . The political risk index is the sum of these 11 sub-indices,
and covers 140 countries in 2005.
The corruption perception index, constructed by Transparency International,
a Berlin-based non-pro t organization devoted to ght corruption worldwide,
is derived by combining information from polls on corruption by a variety of
reputable institutions. For an economy to be included in the CPI data, it needs
to be included in a minimum of three data sources10 . The CPI index in 2005
covers 159 countries.
Control of corruption reects the extent to which public power is perceived
to be exercised for private gains. According to the World Bank Institute, the
notion of corruption here includes both petty and grand forms of corruption, as
well as capture" of the state by elites and private interests. This index is also
constructed from a variety of available indices11 , and covers 207 economies in
2005.
Government e¤ectiveness by the World Bank Institute is meant to measure
quality of public services, quality of the civil service, and the degree of civil
services independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation
and implementation, and the credibility of the governments commitment to
such policies. The WGI builds the index from various data sources and covers
208 economies in 2005 (the broadest country coverage among all indices).
Besides these broad indices, we will also examine the role of a narrower
indicator - expropriation risk - which is a component of the political risk index.
It assigns 12 points to 3 sub-components: (1) Contract Viability/Expropriation,
4 points; (2) Pro ts Repatriation, 4 points; and (3) Payment Delays, 4 points.
These measures are, unsurprisingly, highly correlated. At the same time,
the correlation is less than perfect, reecting some non-overlapping dimensions
of institutional quality that each index aims to capture. Table 2 reports the
pairwise correlations among the 5 measures. The lowest correlation is 0.7. In
Figure 2, we visualize the relationship among these measures. Each graph plots
other institutional quality measures against political risk index.
All measures are potentially relevant for our story. At the same time, since
the political risk index is most comprehensive in capturing di¤erent aspects
of institutional quality, we will use it as the baseline measure of institutional
quality.

3.1.2

Intrinsic Openness Variables

We consider four aspects of intrinsic openness. The rst one is population.
Frankel and Romer (1999) document that a larger population reduces actual
openness (trade/GDP ratio). One may be concerned about whether population
size is "sticky" enough to work as a characteristic of a country. In Figure 3, we
plot log(population) in year 2005 against the value in year 1960; one can see a
high degree of correlation (>0.97) over this span of 50 years. In other words,
the country ranking in terms of population tends to persistent.
The second one is remoteness to the world market (see Wei, 1996, for an early
exposition of the concept). We take G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany
Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and China as the world market.
The remoteness of a small open economy i is de ned as follows:
remotenessi =

8
X

wj log(dij )

j=1
tradej

where j denotes G7 countries and China. wj = X
8

is the international

tradek

k=1

trade share of big country j in total international trade volume of G7 and
importj +exp ortj
China, where tradej =
and dij is the great-circle distance be2
tween country i and j. Finally, variable landlock dummy=1 if the country is
landlocked, otherwise, it takes value 0. Variable coast/area is constructed as
coastline length divided by land area. There are overlaps in landlock dummy
and coastline length/area as they by and large capture similar geographic characteristics. We also notice that there are only 22 landlocked countries in the
sample. Table 3 shows the pairwise correlation matrix between di¤erent dimensions of intrinsic openness. The correlations between intrinsic openness variables
are in general very low.
3.1.3

Other Control Variables

Following the existing literature, we identify and control for other variables
that might a¤ect institutional quality. Legal origin, and having a common
law tradition in particular, is said to be associated with stronger protection
of property rights than other legal traditions (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and
Shleifer, 2008). We include a dummy for countries with a common law system,
which essentially are former British colonies.
Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) argue that the mortality rate of
European settlers more than a century ago is a key determinant of institutional
quality today. So we include mortality rate (its logarithm as they do) as a second
control variable. Note that the AJR sample size is small. In order not to lose too
much information when we include mortality rate, we de ne a variable called
dummy mortality rate availability which takes value 1 if there exists mortality
rate data, otherwise it takes value 0.

14

Ades and Di Tella (1999) suggest that a higher import/GDP ratio of an
economy means more competition and fewer rent seeking opportunities. We
will include the import/GDP ratio as a control.
One version of the "natural resource curse" theory hypothesizes that abundance of natural resources provides a strong incentive for "strong men" to seize
power and hold onto power via undemocratic means in order to bene t from the
wealth associated with the sale of natural resources. Sachs and Warner (1995)
con rm a robustly negative association between natural resource abundance
and growth. Leite and Weidman (1999) provide evidence that natural resource
abundance induces more rent seeking behavior. We use fuel exports as a fraction of total merchandise exports, fuel export frac," to capture the dominance
of natural resources in an economy.
In our theory, both institutional quality and income level (GDP per capita)
are determined by intrinsic openness. (We know institutional quality and income
are highly correlated.) We decompose income into a component that is a linear
function of intrinsic openness and a second component that is orthogonal to
intrinsic openness. We will use the orthogonal component of income as a control
variable as well.

3.2

Evidence on the Key Predictions

We start with cross-sectional evidence, and our main regressions use the following speci cation:
qi

=

0+ 1

log (populationi ) +
+ 4 coast=areai +X 0i +i

2 remotenessi + 3 landlock _ dummy i

(19)

where qi is institutional quality and X 0 is a set of controls. Tables 4 - 6 report
the estimation with 5 institutional quality measures.
In Column 1 of Table 4, we have population and remoteness as the only
regressors. Both coe¢cients on these regressors are negative and statistically
signi cant at the 1% level. A negative coe¢cient on log population indicates that
a larger population is associated with poorer quality of public institutions (or a
higher political risk). (Recall that a higher value of the political risk index means
a lower level of political risk.). The coe¢cient on log distance means that a
decrease in a countrys distance to the world market by one percent is associated
with an improvement in political risk by 0.15 percent. For example, should
Paraguay (whose remoteness value is 9.48) be relocated to where Republic of
Korea is (whose remoteness is 7.96), its political risk index would improve by
23 points, roughly to the level of Spain.
In Columns 2-4 of Table 4, we add a landlock dummy or (and) the ratio of
coastline length/area. The signs of the new coe¢cients are always as expected
from the theory, namely, being landlocked is associated with worse institutional
quality, and a longer coastline for a given area size is associated with higher
institutional quality. While the ratio of coastline length/area is signi cant at
the 10% level, the landlock dummy is not.
15

In Columns 5-8, we add a common law dummy, mortality rate (or earlier
European settlers), import/GDP ratio, and fuel exports (as a fraction of total
merchandise exports) as controls. We nd that both mortality rate and fuel exports are signi cantly detrimental to institutional quality (consistent with the
arguments in Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001, and Leite and Weidmann, 1999). On the other hand, the common law dummy, suggesting that the
legal origin hypothesis is not robustly supported by the data in the context of
institutional quality. The ratio of import/GDP is not signi cant either. Indeed,
the negative sign on the import/GDP ratio is not consistent with the prediction
of Ades and Di Tella (1999), once a set of measures of a countrys intrinsic
openness is included.
In Column 9, we include all four control variables together, along with four
intrinsic openness variables. Three of the intrinsic openness measures (population size, remoteness, and the landlock dummy) are statistically signi cant,
and all four measures have signs that are consistent with the theoretical predictions. As an illustration of the magnitude of the estimates, if Zambia were
not landlocked, its political risk index would have been improved to Romanias score. In this expanded speci cation, both mortality rate and fuel exports
remain signi cant.
Because intrinsic openness could raise income by improving institutions in
our theory, we attempt to extract a part of per capita GDP that is not explained
by our intrinsic openness measures and include it as a control variable. In
particular, we rst regress log GDP per capita on the four measures of intrinsic
openness, and denote the residuals from the regression as e_log(GDP C): We
then add this to the list of control variables in the political risk regression, and
report the results in Column 10. A positive sign on e_log(GDP C) suggests
that income has an indepdent inuence on the quality of public institutions.
Perhaps as a country becomes richer, it can better a¤ord to invest in public
institutions, including paying civil servants better.
In Tables 5 and 6, we substitute the left hand side variable, the political risk
index, by the corruption perception index, control of corruption, government
e¤ectiveness, and expropriation risk, respectively. We draw similar conclusions
on intrinsic openness measures. Both population and remoteness have the expected signs, and are robustly signi cant in almost all the columns. The landlock
dummy and the ratio of coastline length/area are not always signi cant, though
they almost always have the expected signs. Note that landlocked economies are
often small economies with data problems. Among the 22 landlocked economies
in the world, 13 of them lack data on institutional quality to be included in our
regressions.
When we use control of corruption and government e¤ectiveness as institutional quality measures where we have full coverage of 150 countries, in the
columns with a full set of control variables (with or without e_log(GDP C)),
both landlock dummy and coastline length/area are statistically signi cant.
Finally, in Table 5 and Table 6, common law dummy is not robust but its
sign is always positive and it sometimes becomes signi cant. Mortality rate and
fuel export fraction decreases institutional quality. But there is no evidence that
16

larger import/GDP ratio improves institutions.

3.3

Income Inequality and Institutional Quality

In the second part of the theory in Section 2, we presented a political economy
extension of the basic model that features heterogeneity in capital endowment
(which might be proxied by income or wealth equality). The prediction of the
model is that higher inequality leads to worse institutional quality. We now add
income inequality as measured by a Gini coe¢cient of income distribution to
the model. (We are not able to use wealth inequality due to a lack of data.)
The results are reported in Table 7. The coe¢cient on the Gini variable
is negative and signi cant. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction
that inequality leads the society to invest less in institutional building. Since
inequality could be endogenous and we do not have an instrumental variable
strategy for it, this result should only be regarded as suggestive.
Note that the four dimensions of intrinsic openness (population, remoteness,
ratio of coastal length/area size, and a landlock dummy) have essentially the
same signs and signi cance levels as before. We thus conclude that the e¤ects of
intrinsic openness on institutional quality are not qualitatively a¤ected by the
control of income inequality or political economy considerations.

Long Di¤erences: Exogenous Changes in Intrinsic Openness

The results reported previously are cross-sectional evidence. By necessity, such
analysis cannot control for country xed e¤ects. This is not unusual in the
literature on this topic, since institutional quality does not change at a high frequency. For example, the well-cited work of Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson
(2003) does not control for country xed e¤ects. In our case, most dimensions
of intrinsic openness are also slow-moving variables, which make it hard to obtain meaningful variations over time. Nonetheless, if we could produce some
evidence on time series variations, we could control for country xed e¤ects and
produce a useful complement to the cross-sectional evidence.
We identify changes in the external trading environment during 2000-2006 as
a plausible natural experiment. During this period, a signi cant event is Chinas
accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001. From 2000 to 2006, Chinas
tari¤s and non-tari¤ trade barriers were dramatically slashed according to the
terms of its WTO accession (which mandated trade liberalization according
to a time schedule). Since policy changes mandated on China are essentially
unilateral liberalization (with no required changes in trading partners policies),
this represents an exogenous and watershed shock for most other economies.
Indeed, trade between China and the rest of the world exploded afterwards
(doubling once every four years on average).
Importantly, the same China trade shock implies heterogeneous e¤ects on
the trading opportunities of di¤erent countries. For example, a given increase
17

in Chinas total imports implies greater bene ts to countries that are geographically close to China e.g, Republic of Korea) than those that are far away (e.g.,
Mexico). Similarly, holding geographic distance constant, reductions in Chinas
trade barriers also translate into di¤erent opportunities for di¤erent countries
depending on how well their export baskets match with Chinas import need.
The China trade shock has been employed in a booming recent literature to
study the e¤ects of international trade on local US labor markets (Autor, Dorn,
and Hanson, 2013; Wang, Wei, Yu, and Zhu, 2017), US electoral politics (Autor,
Dorn, Hanson and Majlesi, 2016), and productivity and innovation in Europe
(Bloom, Draca and Van Reenen, 2015). Note that, for many of the papers in
this literature, the period that covers the year before China joined the WTO
(e.g., 2000) to the year before the Global Financial Crisis (e.g., 2006 or 2007) is
used.
While changes in Chinas trade barriers were a major source of the change
in global trading environment during 2000-2006, policy changes in other major
economies during this period such as the United States and the European Union
also matter.
We now turn to long-di¤erence evidence exploring exogenous changes in
intrinsic openness faced by small and medium sized countries duirng 2000-2006.
We rst describe the construction of key variables.

4.1

Data Description

As a measure of the change in institutional quality over 2001-2007, we use the
change in the political risk index for this period. The political risk index by
its nature captures many dimensions of institutional quality such as corruption,
impartiality of the legal system, government discretion, and policy uncertainty,
and is therefore regarded as a comprehensive measure of public governance. We
have a consistent source of the political risk measure for this period. In comparison, other measures of institutional quality (the corruption perception index,
control of corruption, and government e¤ectiveness) often change the underlying sources of surveys and the number of underlying surveys in di¤erent years,
which makes comparions over time less meaningful. Indeed, the world governance indicators including control of corruption and government e¤ectiveness,
for example, warn readers from making comparisons in di¤erent years. (In any
case, in any given year, the political risk index and other proxies of institutional
quality are highly correlated. This is con rmed in Figure 2, which presents the
scatter plots on the pairwise relations for these variables in 2005.)
We use changes in tari¤ rates by Chinas and G-7 advanced economies during 2000-2006 as exogenous shocks to intrinsic openness of other economies.
Figure 4 plots the trade weighted average of MFN (most favored nation) import
tari¤ rates by each of these economies (all EU member states have identical
tari¤ rates). Clearly, reductions in Chinas tari¤s in this period dominate tari¤
changes in other big economies. At the same time, other big economies also
have some changes in their tari¤ rates.
We will relate changes in the institutional quality of a (small and medium
18

sized) country over 2001-2007 to changes in its intrinsic openness during 20002006 that were triggered by changes in trade policies of China or G7.
4.1.1

Weighted Tari¤: Country Level

A key component of Country is external trading environment in year t is the
weighted average of the tari¤ rates of China plus G7 in that year, with weights
proportional to the large countries relative importance in Country is export
bundles:
weighted tarif fit =

8
X

wij;t

1

log(1 + tarif fjt )  100

(20)

j=1

where tarif fjt is country j MFN import tari¤12 in year t and
wijt =

exp ortijt
8
X

(21)

exp ortijt

j=

where exp ortijt is country i (merchandise) exports to country j in year t. Index
j denotes either China or one of the G7 economies. A change in this measure
for country i from 2000 to 2006 represents a change in the external trading
opportunity for the country over this period.
In our regression analysis, we will exclude EU member countries from our
sample, partly because four EU countries are part of the G7 group, and partly
because some of the changes in institutional quality in many new EU members
from Central and Eastern Europe are mandated by the EU accession requirement, unrelated to intrinsic openness.
We also exclude Yemen and Mongolia as potential outliers. The shares
of exports to China in total exports are the highest for these countries (89%
for Yemen, and 67% for Mongolia, respectively). Both predominantly export
natural resources to China (oil and oil products for Yemen, and copper ore,
gold, and coal for Mongolia, respectively). The Chinese tari¤ rates on natural
resources products were relatively low (4.2% on average in 2000), and did not
change much during 2000-2006 (3.3% on average in 2006)13 .
Table 8 Panel A reports summary statistics on changes in key variables
over 2000-2006 (tari¤ variables) or 2001-2007. 102 countries have data on both
weighted tari¤s and political risk index. One can see that the median change
in the weighted tari¤ is negative (-0.21), suggesting an improvement in intrinsic
openness for most countries. In fact, out of 102 countries, 70 countries experienced an improvement in intrinsic openness. The largest drop (minimum
1 2 We also look at e¤ectively applied tari¤ rates instead of the MFN rates, and nd our
results to be robust.
1 3 The average tari¤ rate over all HS codes for natural resources (ores, slag and ash; and
mineral fuels, mineral oils, and products of their distillation, bituminous substances, mineral
waxes) is 4.2% in 2000, compared to 17%, the equally weighted average across all HS 6-digit
products.

19

in the table) is 3.45 percentage points deduction in the average of big partner
countries tari¤ rates. (However, there are also some countries that experienced
an increase in partner countries tari¤ rates, i.e., a deterioriation in their intrinsic openness). Across countries, the mean and median changes in the tari¤
rates of big trading partners are a reduction by 0.34 and 0.21 percentage points,
respectively.
4.1.2

Weighted Tari¤: HS6 Level

As a robustness check, we also construct countries weighted average of tari¤s
at the more disaggregated HS6 level:
weighted tarif fit =

8 X
X

wijk;t

1

log(1 + tarif fjkt )  100

(22)

where tarif fjkt is country j MFN import tari¤ in year t for product k and

(23)

exp ortijkt

j=1 k

where where exp ortijt is country i export to country j of product k in year t
(merchandise export) where the data is from Comtrade. Index j denotes G7
countries and China.
Changes in intrinsic openness measured by big partners product-level tari¤s
have the advantage of being more precise. On the other hand, since bilateral
product level trade data, needed to compute the weights in the openness measure, are often missing, the new measure is available for a smaller sample of
countries (70 countries now versus 102 for the previous measure).
We exclude agriculture products from our calculation since many agriculture
products face quota constraints or receive domestic price support for which we
do not have systematic data. As before, we also exclude EU countries, Mongolia,
and Yemen.
Table 8 Panel B reports the summary statistics. The median in weighted
average of big partners tari¤ rate is 0.29 percentage points across all small and
medium size countries. The largest drop in weighted tari¤ (minimum in the
table) is 7.07 percentage points. 44 out of the 70 countries in the sample faced
a reduction in partners tari¤ (or an improvement in intrinsic openness). The
improvement in intrinsic openness for most countries is driven by a massive
reduction in tari¤ rates by China during this period.
However, some countries may experience a deterioration in their intrinsic
openness. First, G7 countries or China may happen to have raised tari¤ rates
on some products that are important for these countries during this period. For
example, China raised import tari¤ on wool tops and combed wool (HS code
510529) from 15% in 2000 to 38% in 2006. This product happens to be an
important export item for Uruguay, causing it to experience a decline in the
20

measure of its intrinsic openness. Second, a countrys comparative advantage
could have shifted (say, due to di¤erential productivity increases in di¤erent
sectors) in such a way that the weights in their export bundles happen to have
increased for products on which the big partners have a relatively high tari¤
rate. For example, for Guatemala, the United States is its dominant export
destination. Its top two export items used to be candles and tapers, and soaps
and soap products, respectively, in 2000, for which the United States had a zero
tari¤, but changed to womens or girls cotton knitted blouses and shirts, and
womens or girls non-knitted cotton trousers for which the United States had
relatively high tari¤ rates of 19.7% and 8.15%, respectively, in 2006.
The simple correlation between the two measures of changes in intrinsic
openness is 0.35. While there is similarity between the two, they also carry
somewhat information. Hence, results from the two measures can complement
each other.

4.2

Long Di¤erences

We perform long-di¤erence regressions with variations of the following speci cation:
qi = 0 + 1 weighted tarif fi + Xi0  + "i
(24)
where qi is the change in country is institutional quality from 2001 to 2007,
weighted tarif fi is the change in weighted average of big trading partners
tari¤ rates facing the exports from country i from 2000 to 2006, Xi0 is changes
in other control variables that may be relevant for the institutional quality
of country i, such as its import/GDP ratio, and fuel exports as a fraction of
total merchandise exports. Note that settler mortality rate in the 18th or 19th
century and legal origins are not included since they do not change over time.
We maintain that changes in big countries tari¤ rates are exogenous to small
and medium sized countries. This feature is important for assigning a causal
interpretation to the regression estimates.
Table 9 reports the regression results. In Column 1, the coe¢cient on the
change in the weighted average of big partners tari¤ is negative and statistically
signi cant (-1.87). This is consistent with the notion that greater intrinsic
openness leads to better public institutions. A reduction in the average tari¤
rate of the big partners by 1 percentage point leads to an improvement in the
political risk score by 1.87 points.
One can visualize the regression result via a bin scatter plot (Figure 5).
All the observed changes in the partners average tari¤ rates during 2000-2006
are divided into 30 equal-sized bins. Within each bin, there can be many observations corresponding to di¤erent changes in the political risk index during
2001-2007. (Some bins may be empty.) We plot the mean value of the political
risk index across all observations within a bin (on the vertical axis), against the
mean value of the change in the partners tari¤ rate (on the horizontal axis). The
bin scatter plot is a noise reduction technique used in applied microeconomic
research. We can see a clear negative relationship between the two variables: a

21

reduction in big partners tari¤ is associated with an improvement in institutional quality. Moreover, we can see that removing one or two data points will
not alter the negative slope (though the point estimate could change a bit).
In Column 2, we add change in the import/GDP ratio and change in the
fraction of fuel exports in total exports as control variables. The coe¢cients
on the two new regressors are negative but not statistically signi cant. The
coe¢cient on the change in the partners tari¤ rate is still negative and becomes
somewhat larger in absolute magnitude.
In Column 3, we also add change in income level as a control variable. The
coe¢cient on change in income is positive and signi cant: becoming richer is
associated with improvement in institutional quality (which is perhaps not surprising). This time, the coe¢cient on change in the fraction of fuel exports
has also become statistically signi cant. This is consistent with the "natural
resource curse" hypothesis: more resource abundance leads to more competition for rents, often associated with a worsening of public institutions. For the
purpose of this paper, an important feature to note is that the coe¢cient on the
change in partners tari¤ remains negative and statistically signi cant. That
is, our key result is robust - change in intrinsic openness leads to change in
institutional quality. Based on the point estimate in Column 3, a reduction
in the average tari¤ rate of partner countries by one standard deviation (0.66)
leads to an improvement in the political risk score by 1.67 points (=2.536*0.66).
(During this period, the average change in the political risk index for all countries in the sample is an improvement by 0.06 point, and the median change
is zero. Against these statistics, an improvement in the political risk index by
1.67 points is economically signi cant.)
We do the same exercise with the second measure of intrinsic openness (with
partner countries product level tari¤ rates), and report the results in Table 10.
The results are qualitatively similar as before. In particular, the coe¢cient on
the change in the partner countries weight tari¤ is negative and statistically
signi cant in all three columns. This is again consistent with the notion that
greater intrinsic openness leads to greater improvement in institutional quality.
Using the point estimate in the last column as an illustration, a reduction in the
average tari¤ rate of partner countries by one standard deviation (3.71) leads
to an improvement in the political risk score by 1.00 point (=0.271*3.71).
Figure 6 is a bin scatter plot corresponding to Column 1 of the regression
table. We can see clearly a negative relationship between the two variables. The
bin on the far right contains a single country (Mali). If we remove that bin, the
negative relationship is preserved, and the point estimate would become even
bigger.

4.3

Excluding Potential Outliers

We investigate the robustness of our results to removing apparent outliers.
When the rst measure of intrinsic openness is used, Hong Kong appears to
be an outlier in a scatter plot of a change in institutional quality against a
change in intrinsic openness (not reported to save space). We investigate the
22

e¤ect of excluding Hong Kong from the sample and report the new result in the
rst two columns Table 11. We nd that the coe¢cient on the change in the
weighted average tari¤ of the big trading partners is still negative and statistically signi cant at the 5% level. Indeed, the point estimate becomes bigger
in absolute magnitude. This means that an even greater improvement in institutional quality is revealed in response to a given improvement in intrinsic
openness, once Hong Kong is removed from the sample.
When the second measure of intrinsic openness is used, Mali appears as
an outlier. We re-do the regressions after excluding Mali from the sample and
report the results in the rst two columns of Table 12. In this case, the co¢cient
on a change in trading partners tari¤ rates is still negative and statistically
signi cant at the 5% level, and the point estimate becomes larger in absolute
magnitude as well. This suggests that removing the most obvious outliers tends
to strenghten rather than weaken the main conclusions.

4.4

Noise Reduction by Three Year Averages

The values of either institutional quality or tari¤ rates could be noisy in any
given year. As a check for robustness, we implement another version of long
di¤erence regrssions by using three year averages of all key variables at both
ends of the interval. The dependent variable is now the di¤erence between
the average value of institutional quality over 2005-2007, and the average value
of the same variable over 1999-2001. Similarly, the key regressor is now the
di¤erence between the average value of intrinsic openness over 2004-2006 and
the average value of the same variable over 1998-2000.
We report the new regression results in the last two columns of Tables 11
and 12, respectively. In both cases, the noise reduction procedure makes the
key point estimates somewhat bigger, without altering their signs or statistical
signi cance.

4.5

Checking for Pre-trend

Changes in institutional quality might simply follow a trend, and the correlation
with changes in intrinsic openness (triggered largely by Chinas accession to
WTO) could be a coincidece.
To check for the validity of this story, we substitute the dependent variable
- a change in institutional quality change from 2001 to 2007 - by a change
in the same variable from 1995 to 2001 (i.e., before China joined the WTO).
Table 13 reports the results of this placebo test (omitting the reporting of other
coe¢cients). The coe¢cients on the change in intrinsic openness over 2000-2006
are now not di¤erent from zero statistically. This suggests that our conclusion is
unlikely to be driven by a coincidental correlation between di¤erential trends in
the improvement of institutional quality across countries and changes in intrinsic
openness.

4.6

Industry-speci c Sensitivity to Institutional Quality

The empirical exercise so far treats intrinsic openness in all industries equally.
Nunn(2007) makes the point that di¤erent industries may have di¤erent degrees
of sensitivity to institutional quality. Nunn(2007) pioneers two measures of contract intensity (relationship speci city) for each nal good using U.S. I-O table.
The rst measure is the fraction of input that can neither be bought and sold
on an exchange nor referenced priced. The second measure also includes reference priced inputs as being relationship-speci c. For example, the same level of
corruption may damage trade in di¤erentiated goods more than it does trade in
homogeneous goods. Combining this insight with our theory on endogenous institutional quality, one might expect intrinsic openness increase in the contract
intensive industries will increase institutional quality while intrinsic openness
increase in the non-contract intensive industries will not increase institutional
quality signi cantly.
To test this additional prediction, we rst group all HS6 products into two
categories. One group is contract intensive products, and the other is noncontract intensive products, separated by the median of relationship speci city
(or contract intensive) measure across all industries provided in Nunn(2007)14 .
We will employ his rst measure of contract intensity in our benchmark regressions and leave the second measure as robustness check. For each product group,
we obtain the long di¤erence in weighted tari¤ as before. We then compute each
countrys export share (year 2000, 2001 and 2002 three years average) of contract intensive products i and non-contract intensive products 1
i , where
i denotes country i. Multiplying the long di¤erence in weighted tari¤ by the
export share of each group, we have two variables weighted tarif f cii , and
weighted tarif f nii for contract intensive (abbreviated as "ci") products
and non-contract intensive (abbreviated as "ni") products respectively.
Table 14 reports the summary statistics. One can see the median weighted
tarif f cii and weighted tarif f nii are both negative and median i is
around 0.5. Among the 70 countries in the sample, the smallest three i come
from Algeria, Azerbaijan and Iran, which are natural resource exporters. The
largest two i come from Costa Rica and Singpore. Costa Ricas top exports
are optical, technical, and medical apparatus. Singapores main export products
are integrated circuits re ned petroleum, and computers.
We run the following regressions:
qi =

0

+

1 weightedtarif f

cii +

2 weightedtarif f

nii + Xi0  + "i :

Table 15 reports the results. In column (1), we only include weighted tarif f
cii and weighted tarif f nii as regressors. The coe¢cient before weightedtarif f
cii is negative and statistically signi cant, while the coe¢cient before weightedtarif f
nii is not statisticall di¤erent from zero. This means that improvement in intrinsic openness on contract intensive products helps to promote more investment in

public institutions, leading to a higher quality of institutions. At the same time,
improvement in intrinsic openness on products that are not contract intensive
does not do much to alter the incentive to improving institutions.
In colums (2) and (3), we add more control variables as in the previous
section. Our results remain robust. In Table 16, we repeat the same exercise,
using the second (broader) de nition of contractive intensive products in Nunn
(2007) in computing changes in intrinsic openness. Again, we see the same
patterns on the coe¢cients, suggesting that our results are robust.

5

Concluding Remarks

We propose a theory that links endogenous institutional quality to a countrys
intrinsic openness, and provide several pieces of evidence.
Empirical tests con rm that intrinsically more open countries, i.e. countries
with a smaller population, geographically closer to the world market, or endowed
with a longer coastline, display better institutional quality.
Intrisinc openness is not immutable. Globalization, in particular, changes in
trading partners trade barriers could a¤ect a countrys external trading opportunities. Using big economies import tari¤ change, especially those associated
with Chinas accession to the WTO in 2001, as a source of variation in intrinsic openness for other economies, we also nd evidence that improvement in
intrinsic openness leads to improvement in institutional quality.
As Nunn (2007) points out, some products are more sensitive to the soundness of contractual institutions and legal environment than other products. We
incorporate this insight to implement a re ned test. In particular, we expect
institutional improvement to respond more to changes in intrinsic openness
triggered by partner countries changes in trade barriers on contract intensive
products, than to changes in tari¤s on non-contract intensive products. Our
empirical exercise con rms this idea.
One implication of our paper is that globalization can have an indirect but
important channel to improve welfare. One countrys trade liberalization might
create a positive externality by inducing other countries to improving their public institutions. Investigating and quantifying such links might be a fruitful line
of future research.

Notes : This table reports relevant variables summary statistics for the sample we use in the
cross sectional regressions. It utilizes year 2005 data. PR index is political risk index which
falls into [0,100]; CPI is Corruption Perception Index which falls into [0,10]; ctr corrupt is
control of corruption which falls into [-2.5,+2.5], gvnment is government e¤ectiveness which
falls into [-2.5,2.5]; exprop risk is expropriation risk (investment pro le item in Political Risk
Index) which falls into [0, 12]; remoteness unit is km; coastline length/areas unit is km/sq.
km2 . Mortality rate (per person) is taken from Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001).
Fuel export fraction is with respect to total merchandise export, computed in WDI using
Comtrade data. Gini index is income Gini. GDP per capita is measured at constant 2010
US dollars. We dont nd Korea, D.P.R. and Somalia GDP data in year 2005 or around
2005 from WDI, and import/GDP, trade/GDP and GDP per capita data are also missing
for these two countries. There is no Syrian GDP per capita in terms of 2010 US dollars data
in WDI. Another note is Myanmar import/GDP and export/GDP data experience a more
than 100 times jump from before 2011 to after 2012 in World Bank database. The
import/GDP and export/GDP are too low before 2011. For example, in 2005, import/GDP
is 0.95% and export/GDP is 0.18%. We suspect there is a data error and contact World
Bank sta¤. The problem lies in the fact that they take Myanmar trade data from IMF but
there is a huge di¤erence in the exchange rate between the World Bank measure and the
IMF measure for Myanmar. In the IMF data, there is a more than around 100 times jump
in exchange rate from 2011 to 2012. So here we simply multiply Myanmar import/GDP and
export/GDP by 100 in year 2005 as a rough estimate (the minimum of trade/GDP in the
table is Myanmar even after we multiply its number by 100.) All our results remain virtually
unchanged by excluding Myanmar directly.

A2. Gravity Equations with Institutional Quality

In this Appendix, we aim to verify a key assumption in our model: better
institutional quality promotes international trade more than it does domestic
trade.
We augment the standard empirical gravity equation in two ways. First,
we expand the sample of bilateral trade to include internal trade (a countrys
trade with itself) for all countries in the sample. Second, we add by institutional
quality, and an interaction term between institutional quality and a dummy for
international trade as additional regressors.
A countrys internal trade is the di¤erence between the value of its gross
output and the value of its international trade (Wei, 1996). Since it is easy to
obtain data on the value of bilateral merchandize trade but nearly impossible
to obtain data on bilateral service trade, we will focus on merchandize trade.
Using the national input-output tables in the GTAP (Global Trade Analysis
Project) database, we compute gross output in the non-service sectors for all
countries in 2005 by multiplying the value added in the non-service sectors in
2005 with the ratio of gross output/GDP in the non-service sectors in 200415 . A
countrys gross non-service trade with itself is then computed as its gross nonservice output minus the sum of all its non-service exports to all other countries.
Following Wei (1996), domestic distance for country i, dii , is proxied by 1/4 of
the countrys distance to the nearest neighbor.
We perform two sets of empirical regressions. The rst empirical setup (no
country xed e¤ect) is
log ( exp ortij ) =
0 + 1 log (dij ) + 1 qi + 2 qj +   dummy(i 6= j)  q i
+  dummy(i = j) +  1 X i + 2 Xj +q i qj +ij
(25)
where the left hand side is exports from country i to country j, while on the
right hand side, dij is the greater circle distance between countries i and j, qi
denotes institutional quality in country i, Xi includes log(GDP )16 , landlock
dummy and coastline length/area.
In this speci cation, the key parameter of interest is . A positive and
signi cant coe¢cient on the interaction term would validate the idea that the
same improvement in a countrys institutions would promote more international
trade more than it does internal trade.
The regression results are reported in Panel A of Table 17. The standard
gravity variables such exporters log GDP and importers log GDP are always
positive and statistically signi cant (not reported to save space). A positive
and signi cant coe¢cient on the dummy(i=j) shows home bias in trade. Most
1 5 Because IO tables are not available for every year, we can obtain the ratio for 2004 and
2007 (in the neighborhood of 2005). The ratios in these two years are quite similar.
1 6 We notice that when we perform gravity equations with institutional quality and GDP,
one problem is that institutional quality could a¤ect trade via its e¤ect on GDP as well.
To capture the total e¤ect of institutional quality on trade, we use the predicted value of
log(GDP) by log(population) to substitute log(GDP).

49

important to us, we nd that the coe¢cient on importers institutional quality (qj ) is positive and signi cant, and the coe¢cient on the interaction term
(dummy(i 6= j)  q i ) is also positive and signi cant. This means that with an
improvement in an importers institution, there would be more bilateral trade
with anyone (including with itself), and the increase in international trade is
more than that in internal trade.
In Panel B of Table 17, we instrument a countrys institutional quality by
settler mortality based on the idea of Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001).
We obtain the same results. In particular, better institutions generate a bigger
positive response in international trade than in domestic trade.
In the second speci cation, we add separate importer xed e¤ects and exporter xed e¤ects:
log ( exp ortij ) =
0 + 1 log (dij ) +  i + j
+   dummy(i 6= j)  q i +  dummy(i = j) + q i qj +ij

(26)

where i and j are exporter or importer xed e¤ects. This speci cation is
more general than the rst one, and therefore is preferred.
The results are reported in 18. The coe¢cient, , on the interaction term between a dummy for international trade and the importers quality of institution
is positive and statistically signi cant. This supports the notion that international trade is more sensitive to domestic institutional quality than internal
trade.

A3: Residual Openness and Institutional Quality

A countrys actual openness (e.g., import as a share of GDP) is a¤ected by both
intrinsic (exogenous) openness and policies. In this appendix, we undertake a
two-step exercise. First, we decompose a countrys actual openness into (a)
intrinsic openness - the tted value from regressing the actual openness on
the countrys geographic features and the population size, and (b) "residual
openness" - the residuals from the above regression. Second, we check how much
a countrys institutional quality could be "explained" by "residual openness"
relative to intrinsic openness.
We start with the following regression:
log (trade=GDP i ) =

0+ 1

log (populationi ) + 2 remotenessi +
3 landlock _ dummy i + 4 coast=areai +i

Table 19 shows that the set of intrinsic openness variables collectively explains
about 37% of the actual openness.
In the second step, we regress institutional quality on both the "residual
openness" and the set of intrinsic openness variables. The institutional quality
is measured by one of the ve indices, respectively: the political risk index,
control of corruption (as measured by Transparency International), control of
corruption (as measured by the World Bank Institute), government e¤ectiveness
(WBI), and expropriation risk (WBI).
qi

=

0+ 1

log (populationi ) + 2 remotenessi +
+ 4 coast=areai +  residual_ open +  i

3 landlock _ dummy i

(27)

Table 20 reports the results. We nd that residual openness is not statistically
signi cant in any of the regressions, whereas the intrinsic openness variables do
seem to matter as in the main text. In particular, a country that is relatively
large or far from the world market or have a shorter coastline tends to have
worse quality of institutions.
It is striking that "residual openness" is uncorrelated with quality of institutions. It suggests that variations in openness induced by own trade policies that
are not explained by intrinsic openness are unlikely to inuence institutional
quality. (In comparison, our paper has shown that trade liberalization by other
countries might very well a¤ect a countrys incentive to investing in institutional
quality.)

A4. A Scale E¤ect in the Public Sector?

In this appendix, we check if a larger population implies a lower cost in delivering
public services as a share of GDP (the scale e¤ect).
The dependent variable is general government expenditure (relative to GDP)
from IMFs Government Finance Statistics (GFS). We regress
(gov exp enditurei =GDPi ) =

0

+

1

log(populationi ) + i

(28)

Government expenditure exhibits uctuations from one year to the next. To
reduce noise, the left hand side variable is averaged across all years during 20002015. The right hand side variable is log(population) in year 2005. The sample
consists of all countries for which the data are available for at least ve years
during 2000-2015. If there is a scale e¤ect, we would expect to see a negative
coe¢cient on log population.
Figure 7 presents a scatter plot. Contrary to the scale e¤ect hypothesis, there
is no discernible negative relationship between the two. The regression con rms
this: the slope coe¢cient is even positive though not statistically signi cant.
As another check, we replace the dependent variable by public sector payroll
as a share of GDP, and present a scatter plot in Figure 8. Again, we do not see
a statistically signi cant relationship between the two variables.
As the population becomes larger, we suspect that the number of layers of
government tends to increase also. That may be one reason why the data do
not support the notion of a scale e¤ect in public service provision.

A5: Export Opportunities and Institutional Quality

The benchmark model in the main text leaves out general equilibrium income
e¤ect, thus only import trade cost matters. In this appendix, we provide a
model featuring export costs and explore how exogenous changes in export opportunities will endogenously a¤ect the institutional quality.
We begin by presenting an economy with a xed institutional quality and
then endogenize institutional quality. The home country productivity is normalized to 1. It imports N  number of varieties from foreign countries. There are in
total N varieties produced domestically with population L. Foreign aggregate
demand for each domestic variety is
D (p e )



where D is taken as exogenous (the numeraire is foreign varitys f.o.b. price
p = 1),  e is a function of the physical distance, institutional quality and
foreign import policy, and p is the f.o.b price of domestic good.
Domestic households utility is
u = logH
where H is the consumption of nal good which is a CES aggregation of both
foreign and domestic varieties with elasticity of substitution  > 1. The demand
function from domestic residents faced by a domestic variety is



1

W L(p )



where W is wage. A labor market clearing condition requires
N[





] = L:

Assuming that the rms are monopolistically competitive, we obtain
p=

W:

This simpli es the labor market clearing condition to yield:



= W  L:

(29)

This equation implies that a lower  e means a larger part of domestic income
(right hand side) is from foreign markets (second term of the left hand side).
Since a change in the wage will a¤ect the domestic market size, this equation
gives an implicit function W (q).
We assume  =  (q),  m = hm d  (q),  e = he d  (q) where d is physical
distance between home and foreign17 , hm and he are foreign trade policy (exogenous to home country), and q is institutional quality. Take log on both sides

physical distance within home country dii is normalized to 1.

institutional quality measure, political risk index, is larger than 10. A conservative value for  is 2, so it is easy to satisfy the above condition empirically.
In sum, with an increase in the exogenous export opportunities, a country
will nd the marginal bene t of increasing institutional quality to be higher.
The intuition is similar to the benchmark version in the main text that focuses
on the import side: at a given quality of institutions, the domestic income now
has a larger part coming from the export market. If exports are more sensitive
to institutions than domestic trade, this generates incentives for the country to
upgrade its institutional quality.
