ABSTRACT
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported an extraordinary increase in temporary help supply
(THS) employment during the late 1980s and the 1990s. However, little is known about the venues where
these THS employees actually work. Our estimates indicate that the proportion of THS employees in each
major American industry, except the public sector, increased during 1977-97. By 1997, close to 4 percent
of the employees in manufacturing and services were THS workers. In the service sector, the increase was
accompanied by a large increase in direct hires. In manufacturing, however, it was accompanied by a
decline in direct hiring from its peak in 1989 even though output increased substantially in the 1990s.
Practically, all of the growth in THS employment is attributed to a change in the hiring behavior of firms,
rather than to a disproportional increase in the size of more THS-intensive industries.

Introduction
In the last ten years or so, employment in the temporary help supply (THS)

industry has more than tripled in the United States.1 The increased use of individuals
hired from THS firms is evident in the payroll data published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS). Although employment in the THS industry represented only about 2
percent of total nonfarm employment in 1997, it accounted for 10 percent of the net
increase between 1991 and 1997. Since 1972, employment in the THS industry has risen
at an annual rate of more than 11 percent while total nonfarm employment expanded only
2 percent per year (Figure 1). In addition, the variability and cyclical sensitivity of THS
jobs have been extraordinarily high (Golden, 1996). If we wish to understand the reasons
for the timing and magnitude of the changes in employment in the THS industry, we need
to know more about the changing demand for this type of nonstandard worker.
Knowledge of precisely where THS employees actually work is a first step towards this
goal. Furthermore, this information is essential to assess the impact of the rapid growth
in the THS industry on the performance of the sectors that hire such workers (Segal and
Sullivan, 1995; Estevão and Lach, 1999).
There is, however, very scant direct evidence concerning the industry of
assignment of THS workers. Because the BLS classifies employees by the industry of
the employing firm rather than by the industry where they are actually working, THS
workers are not included in the regularly reported measures of employment in those
industries. This paper aims to remedy this problem by combining different sources of
information about the THS industry to generate estimates of the flow of these workers
going to major U.S. industries from 1977 to 1997.
In the next section, we define the measurement problem in more detail and
discuss the different data sources that can be used to analyze the recent developments in
the THS industry. In Section 3, we provide estimates for the proportion of THS
employees working in each major sector of the U.S. economy. These estimates are based
on the analysis of input-output tables published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA) for 1977, 1982, 1987 and 1992, and on the Contingent Worker Supplement to the

September 1997).

CPS of February 1995 and February 1997. These two supplements constitute the only
direct evidence on where THS employees actually work. Section 4 decomposes the
recent increase in THS employment into the contribution of two different sources of
growth: changes in the size and changes in the THS-intensity of eight major sectors of the
U.S. economy. Conclusions are presented in Section 5.
2

The Measurement Problem and Data Sources
The inherent measurement difficulty stems from the fact that BLS establishment

surveys classify THS agency workers as employed in SIC 7363 (Help Supply Services),
rather than being included in the measured employment of the industries actually using
their labor. This occurs because THS workers are not on the payroll of the using firm.
Let yt = 1 denote the event that an individual is a THS worker in period t. The
time subscript is hereafter omitted for notational convenience. The parameters of interest
are the probability that an individual working in industry i (e.g., manufacturing or
services) is a THS, denoted by θi ≡ P(y=1|i), and the probability that a THS employee
works in industry i, denoted by αi ≡ P(i|y=1).
The two parameters are related by Bayes theorem as shown below:

(1)

θ i ≡ P( y = 1 | i ) = P(i | y = 1)

P( y = 1)
P ( y = 1)
=αi
P (i)
P(i)

The expression for θi means, for example, that if a THS worker has a 30 percent
chance of working in manufacturing (αi = 0.30) then the number of THS workers
employed in manufacturing relative to total employment is 0.30 times P(y=1) which,
given that the THS industry comprised about 2 percent of the workforce in 1997, equals
0.006. Using 0.15 as the value for P(i) in 1997, the proportion of THS workers relative
to manufacturing employment, θi, would be 4 percent.
In order to estimate θ i we need to estimate P(y=1), P(i), and the assignment
probability αi =P(i|y=1). The first two probabilities are readily estimated from available
data by the observed proportions of THS and industry i workers in every year. The last
probability, however, is problematic because there is no systematic information about the

2

distribution of THS workers by the industry of where they work (the “industry of use”).
Nevertheless, under certain assumptions, estimates of the assignment probability can be
extracted from selected data sources for particular years.
Note that the number of workers in industry ithe denominator in the estimate of
θishould be the true number of workers; that is, the reported number plus the THS
employees working in the industry. Under these conditions, the probability of finding a
THS worker in industry i is estimated by
N

θ̂ i = Pˆ ( y = 1 | i) =
N y =0 ,i + Pˆ (i | y = 1) N y =1
1442443

N y =1, i

where Pˆ (i | y = 1) is some estimate of the assignment probability, and Ny=1 and Ny=0,i are
the observed number of THS and industry i workers, respectively. The numerator in (2)
is the number of THS workers in industry i while the denominator is the total number of
workers in industry i including THS workers.
Several data sets provide both direct and indirect information that can be used to
calculate the conditional probabilities in (2). Table 1 summarizes these data sources.
The Current Employment Survey (CES) of the BLS is an establishment based survey
providing information on the number of workers on the payroll of firms belonging to SIC
7363—Help Supply Services. This is a slightly broader category than purely THS firms,
but nonetheless almost identical to data collected by the National Association of
Temporary and Staffing Services (NATSS) on THS firms (upper chart of Figure 2).2 In
other words, the residual category that explains the difference between the NATSS and
the CES series for THS employment of employment is of trivial size. The number of
THS workers, Ny=1, appearing in equation (2) is from the NATSS. The number of
industry workers, Ny=0, i, appearing in equation (2) is from the CES.

2

Prior to the 1987 revision of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) scheme, THS firms were
classified as SIC 7362 and were part of SIC 736 which also included Employment Agencies (7361) and a
residual category. The 1987 revision combined the THS firms and the residual category (excluding
facilities and continuing maintenance services) into a single category named “Help Supply Services”
classified as SIC 7363.

3

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a household-based survey providing
information on households’ and individuals’ characteristics. It assigns workers to the
industry in which they are employed, broadly equivalent to a 3-digit SIC industry.
Therefore, individuals are not identified as employed in the Temporary Help Supply
industry as such, but in the 3-digit industry (SIC 736) that contains THS, i.e., the Personal
Supply Services (PSS) industry. However, the share of THS firms in total PSS
employment was about 90 percent in 1997 and, as shown in the lower chart of Figure 2,
changes over time in manufacturers’ use of PSS workers mainly reflect changes in the
use of THS workers. Unfortunately, the regular CPS does not include a question about
the industry to which PSS employees are assigned.3
The Contingent Worker Supplements to the CPS of February 1995 and of
February 1997 are other sources of data on the THS industry. In these supplements
respondents were asked directly if they were paid by a Temporary Help Supply agency.
Furthermore, the supplements recorded the respondents’ industry of assignment. Thus,
these surveys constitute the only direct evidence on the distribution of THS workers by
industry of use.
Finally, under certain assumptions, input-output tables from the BEA provide
estimates of the distribution of PSS workers among different industries. The
commodities-use tables measure the dollar amount of output from one sector that is used
as input to another sector. These transactions are registered at approximately a three-digit
level of aggregation; therefore input-output tables do not provide information on THS
firms but on PSS firms (SIC 736). When wages of PSS workers and other fees are
largely independent of their industry of assignment, the proportion of the PSS industry’s
output that goes to industry i (the input–output coefficient) is equivalent to the proportion
of PSS hours used by in industry i.
Formally, the nominal output in the PSS sector can be written as
Y = wm H m N m + wr H r N r , where the subscript indicates the industry of assignment (m =

industry under study and r = remaining industries), w = hourly wage plus hourly
overhead fees (including the profit-per-hour of the THS agency), H =average hours of
3

Using a non-parametric approach, Estevão and Lach (1999) use workers’ individual characteristics from
the March CPS tapes to provide a tight range of possible values for the probability of finding a THS worker

4

work and N = number of workers assigned to industry m or r. If w m is approximately
equal to w r , then the proportion of PSS output going to industry m (the input-output
coefficient) is approximately equal to the share of total hours of PSS work going to
industry m. In addition, if H m is approximately equal to H r , then the input-output
coefficient is also a reasonable approximation for the share of employment directed to
manufacturing. For instance, because manufacturing wages per worker ( wmfg H mfg ) are
larger than the average wage in other industries, input-output coefficients will tend to
overestimate a bit the proportion of THS employment directed to manufacturing.
Anyway, input-output tables with the relevant information on the PSS industry are
available for 1977, 1982, 1987 and 1992.

3

The Sectoral Evolution of THS Employment
Under the assumptions discussed above, input-output coefficients could be used

as estimates of the assignment probability, αi, for 1977, 1982, 1987 and 1992. Direct
estimates of αi can also be obtained for 1995 and 1997 using the Contingent Worker
Supplement to the February CPS for each of these years.
In principle, these sources of data provide information at the three-digit level of
aggregation. Because the statistical noise and potential biases of the estimators decrease
with the level of aggregation, we conduct our analysis at the level of eight major
industries: (1) construction; (2) manufacturing; (3) transportation, communication and
utilities; (4) retail and wholesale trade; (5) finance, insurance and real estate (FIRE); (6)
services; (7) public sector; and (8) other industries (mining, agriculture, forestry and
fisheries).
Figure 3 reports the assignment probabilities. A few points are worth mentioning
here. During 1982-87, the service and public sectors accounted for the lion’s share of
THS workers. After the 1982 peak of 40 percent, the proportion of THS workers
employed in the public sector (includes federal, state and local administration, and public
enterprises) declined dramaticallyto almost zero in 1997. In contrast, the share in

in manufacturing from 1972 to 1997.

5

manufacturing increased no less dramaticallyit tripled between 1987 and 1997and
accounted for about 30 percent of the THS workers in 1997. The demand for THS work
from the service sector also increased substantially. Together, manufacturing and
services firms accounted for about 75 percent of all THS employees in 1997.
The radical changes in the assignment distribution of THS workers must have
been accompanied by changes in the characteristics of THS workers. In particular, the
shift from the public sector to manufacturing suggests that there must also have been a
shift in the direction of more male, blue-collar workers in the 1990s.
Using data from the March CPS files, Table 2 displays the changes in the average
characteristics of individuals working in personnel supply services. While blue-collar
workers comprised 14 percent of the workforce hired by PSS firms in 1977, and only 6
percent in 1985, they accounted for about 25 percent by the mid-90s. The particularly
rapid increase in the proportion of blue-collar workers in the 1990s is consistent with the
evidence from the input-output-tables and the contingent worker supplements pointing to
a surge in the demand for THS employment from manufacturing firms. Most of this
increase was matched by reductions in the proportion of white-collar workers, while the
proportion of clerical workers (pink-collars) edged down.4
Table 2 presents additional evidence suggesting structural changes in the demand
for THS workers. The average proportion of male workers in the PSS industry in 19921997 was more than 10 percentage points higher than in 1977-1987. The share of PSS
employees working part-time (less than 35 hours of work per week) declined although it
remained well above the average for the whole labor force. The increase in the
proportion of male workers, the reduction in the proportion of employees working parttime and the slight rise in their usual weekly hours of work are also consistent with larger
flows of THS employees to manufacturing firms.5 As an aside, the average PSS worker
seems to have acquired only a bit more education over time: The proportion of
individuals with at least some college increased from 52.5 between 1977 and 1987 to
4

Segal and Sullivan (1995) had already pointed out that the observed rise in the proportion of blue-collar
workers among THS employees in the early 1990s was evidence of increased demand from manufacturers.
5
The proportion of male workers in manufacturing (67 percent in 1997) is substantially larger than in the
rest of the economy (48 percent in 1997). Also, manufacturing employees tend to work longer hours: 41.5
hours per week, on average, in 1997 as opposed to an average of 36.8 hours per week outside
manufacturing.

about 55 percent between 1992 and 1997, while the proportion of PSS workers without a
high school diploma declined.

Composition Effects or Structural Changes?
As shown in Figure 1, the proportion of THS workers in total nonfarm

employment increased from 1 percent in 1990 to about 2 percent in 1997. According to
the National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services (NATSS), in 1990 the THS
industry comprised about 1.2 million workers; in 1997 it reached more than 2.5 million
workers.
The aggregate data, however, masks distinct sectoral trends. Our estimates of θ
for different industries over time (as per equation (2)) are shown in Figure 4. We used
payroll employment data from the CES to compute Ny=0,i for seven of our eight industry
groups. Data from the monthly Employment Situation BLS release for farms, fisheries
and forestry were combined with payroll data from the CES for mining to form the “other
industries” category. In addition, for the sake of presentation, we used a linear
interpolation of the assignment probabilities shown in Figure 3 to estimate the missing
observations when computing θi.6
What stands out is the rapid and sharp increase in manufacturing use of THS
workers, from 1 percent of the sector’s workforce in 1992 to about 4 percent in 1997,
about the same level of THS-intensity as in service industries. Finance, insurance, and
real estate (FIRE) and transportation, communications, and utilities have also shown
significantly larger THS-intensity in the 1990s. But in contrast to manufacturing,
services, FIRE and TCU arrived at this level of THS intensity through steady growth
since the early 1980s. The proportion of THS workers in construction increased
substantially between 1982 and 1987 but has remained roughly constant since then.
Within manufacturing, THS-intensity increased a bit more in durable goods
industries (Figure 5). In addition, the increase was somewhat more noticeable in hightech industrieshere defined as office and computing equipment (SIC 357) and electrical
6

In Estevão and Lach (1999) we use workers’ individual characteristics from the March CPS tapes to
estimate assignment probabilities for the manufacturing sector in the missing years. Although those
estimates provide a more precise picture of the annual variations in the assignment probabilities, they do
not affect the longer-term trends discussed here.

The proportion of the THS industry in total civilian employment, θ t =

where T
Et

is the number of THS workers and E is total nonfarm employment, is equal to a weighted
average of the θit’s in different industries with weights given by the employment share of
each industry. Thus, the changes over time in the aggregate proportion θt depend on
changes in the proportion of THS workers used by each industry, θit, and on the size of
the various industries. More precisely,

Equation (4) can be used to compute the contribution of individual sectors to
aggregate growth. For example, the employment share of the manufacturing sector
declined from 0.25 percent in 1977 to 0.15 percent in 1997. Thus s it = 0.20 and
∆s it = −0.10 . However, the proportion of THS workers increased from 0.00001 to almost

0.04 during the same period. Thus, θ it ≅ 0.02 and ∆θ it ≅ 0.04 . Putting all this information
together, we get that the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the change in

Given the breakdown provided by the CPS we defined “high-tech industries” as the lowest aggregate that
captures developments in office and computing equipment (SIC 357), semiconductors and related products
(SIC 3674) and communications equipment (SIC 366).

8

aggregate θ between 1977 and 1997 is (-0.10*0.02+0.04*0.2) = 0.06, which taking into
account rounding errors in this back-of-the envelope calculation, is close to the 0.5
percentage point in Table 4.
The decomposition in (4) is also useful for identifying the sources of growth. At
one extreme, growth in the aggregate proportion of THS workers can occur even when no
industry increased its THS-intensity, i.e., when ∆θ it = 0 for all i, as a consequence of
the more THS-intensive industries having increased their size over time. In this case,
aggregate growth is due to a purely compositional component.
On the other hand, all industries may be growing at the same pace, ∆sit = 0 for
all i, so that changes in the aggregate θ are directly related to changes in industry-specific
θit’s, their THS-intensity. This indicates changes in the hiring pattern within individual
industries. This is the within component of aggregate growth.
Table 3 contrasts the contribution of the compositional and the within components
with the growth in the ratio of THS workers to total civilian employment. The data
clearly show that most of the growth in this ratio can be attributed to increases in the
latter. In fact, in the most recent period, between 1992 and 1997, this component
accounted for more than 96 percent of the increase in the proportion of THS workers
among all civilian employees.
Table 4 presents a breakdown of the within and the compositional components by
different sectors. As the third row shows, the public sector was the only industry making
a negative contribution to the growth of aggregate θ. More than 90 percent of the public
sector’s negative contribution came from a change in hiring behavior (within component)
and not from the observed relative shrinking of public sector employment (compositional
effect). The service sector accounted for about half of the increase in THS use in the U.S.
since 1977 (0.86 percentage point of the 1.67 percentage point increase in the aggregate
θ), while manufacturing accounted for about a third of the increase (0.50 percentage
point).
Virtually all of the contribution from manufacturing between 1987-1997 is
originated from the within component suggesting a dramatic structural change in
manufacturers’ hiring behavior during this period. This structural change is all the more

9

remarkable because it coincided with a significant decline in the share of manufacturing
employment and, therefore, a negative contribution of this sector to the compositional
component.8
Within manufacturing, as shown in Table 5, the change in THS intensity in
durable goods industries (the within component shown in the second row) accounts for
about 62 percent of the 3.4 percentage points increase during 1977-97. Compositional
effects are insignificant. High-tech industries explain about 17 percent of the total
variation in manufacturing THS-intensity during 1977-97 even though they comprise
only 10 percent of manufacturing employment.
Using the estimates of industry-specific THS employment and shares we adjust
upward the observed employment levels in each industry. Figure 6 plots the evolution of
annual employment levels from 1977 to 1997 after taking into account the employment
of THS workers.9 As noted above, while employment other than THS has been going up
in most industries it declined in manufacturing, so that at the end of 1997, manufacturing
employment remained significantly below the peak reached in 1989. However, after
correcting for THS hires (the dots in Figure 6), manufacturing employment in 1997 was
only slightly lower than the level observed in 1989.
5

Concluding Remarks
This paper focuses on estimating the distribution of THS workers across eight

major sectors of the U.S. economy using input-output data and information from the 1995
and 1997 Contingent Worker Supplement to the CPS. In 1997, about 75 percent of all
THS employees worked in manufacturing or service sector firms, compared to 40 percent
in 1982. This reallocation of THS workers has occurred at the expense of the public
sector. It was accompanied by changing characteristics of the THS employees in the
direction of significantly more males and blue-collar individuals who are, on average, a
bit more educated now than they had been in the 1980s.

8

The combination of the two effects suggests that manufacturers may have substituted temporary workers
hired from THS firms for directly hired temporary workers.
9
In order to add up regular and THS employees we must assume that THS workers are full-time
equivalents and are not merely replacing temporary absent regular employees. The general perception is
that THS workers are regarded as fully substitutable for regular employees.

10

Our results show that the recent large increase in the proportion of THS workers
in the economy is due to a change in the hiring behavior of firms in the private sector. It
is not due to a reallocation of workers from the less to the more THS-intensive industries.
This suggests that the reasons for the dramatic growth in THS employment should be
traced to the forces underlying changes in firms’ hiring patterns.
Many reasons have been advanced to explain the rapid spread of THS
arrangements. These include the potential for employers to implement a new, lowerwage rate in a two-tier wage structure by contracting with intermediaries that pay less for
similar work, realize scale economies due to specialization in the provision of specific
tasks, increase productivity given that THS may be better screened or trained than
temporary workers hired directly by the firm (Autor, 1998; Polivka, 1996), and facilitate
more rapid changes in firms’ level of employment in response to temporary and/or
unpredictable changes in demand (Abraham and Taylor, 1996; Golden, 1996).
The estimates of temporary employment by sector discussed in this paper should
provide guidance for future research aimed at testing some of these potential
explanations. In particular, researchers must account for the observed differences in the
timing of the changes in firms’ hiring behavior in manufacturing and service sector
industries.
