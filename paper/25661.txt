The Lost Ones: the Opportunities and Outcomes of Non-College Educated Americans Born

ABSTRACT
White, non-college-educated Americans born in the 1960s face shorter life expectancies, higher
medical expenses, and lower wages per unit of human capital compared with those born in the
1940s, and men's wages declined more than women's. After documenting these changes, we use a
life-cycle model of couples and singles to evaluate their effects. The drop in wages depressed the
labor supply of men and increased that of women, especially in married couples. Their shorter life
expectancy reduced their retirement savings but the increase in out-of-pocket medical expenses
increased them by more. Welfare losses, measured a one-time asset compensation are 12.5%, 8%,
and 7.2% of the present discounted value of earnings for single men, couples, and single women,
respectively. Lower wages explain 47-58% of these losses, shorter life expectancies 25-34%, and
higher medical expenses account for the rest.

Introduction

Much of macroeconomics either studies policies having to do with business cycle
fluctuations or growth. Business cycle fluctuations are typically short-lived, do not
affect a cohort’s entire life cycle, and tend to have smaller welfare effects. Growth,
instead, drastically improves the outcomes and welfare of successive cohorts over their
entire lives compared to previous cohorts. Yet, recent evidence indicates that while
we are still experiencing growth at the aggregate level, many people in recent cohorts
are worse off, rather than benefiting from aggregate growth. It is important to study
and better understand these cohort-level shocks and their consequences before trying
to evaluate to what extent current government policies attenuate this kind of shocks
and whether we should re-design some policies to reduce their impacts.
Recent research suggests that understanding these cohort-level shocks and their
consequences is an important question. Guvenen et al. (2017) find that the median
lifetime income of men born in the 1960s is 12-19% lower than that of men born in
the 1940s, while Roys and Taber (2017) document that the wages of low-skilled men
have stagnated over a similar time period. Hall and Jones (2007) highlight that the
share of medical expenses to consumption has approximately doubled every 25 years
since the 1950s, and Case and Deaton (2015 and 2017) have started an important
debate by showing that the mortality rate of white, less-educated, middle-aged men
has been increasing since 1999. In contrast with men’s, the median lifetime income
of women born in the 1960s is 22-33% higher than that of women born in the 1940s
(Guvenen et al. 2017). The latter change, however, occurred in conjunction with
much increased participation of women in the labor market.
While very suggestive, the changes in lifetime income tell us little about what
happened to wages. In addition, depending on how wages, medical expenses, and
mortality changed for married and single men and women, they can have weaker or
stronger effects on couples, single men, and single women. Given the size of these
changes and the large number of people that they affect, more investigations of their
consequences is warranted.
The goal of this paper is to better measure these important changes in the lifetime
opportunities of white, single and married, less-educated American men and women
and to uncover their effects on the labor supply, savings, and welfare of a relatively
recent birth cohort. To do so, we start by picking two cohorts of white, non-college

2

educated Americans1 for whom we have excellent data, those born in the 1940s and
those born in the 1960s, and by using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to uncover several new facts.
First, we find that, across these two cohorts, men’s average wages have decreased
in real terms by 9% while women’s average wages have increased by 7%, but that
the increase in wages for women is due to higher human capital of women in the
1960s cohort rather than to higher wages per unit of human capital.2 Second, we
document a large increase in out-of-pocket medical expenses later in life: average
out-of-pocket medical expenses after age 66 are expected to increase across cohorts
by 82%. Third, we show that in middle age, the life expectancy of both female and
male white, non-college-educated people is projected to go down by 1.1 to 1.7 years,
respectively, from the 1940s to the 1960s cohort. All of these changes are thus large
and have the potential to substantially affect behavior and welfare.
We then calibrate a life-cycle model of couples and singles to match the labor
market outcomes for the 1960s cohort. Our calibrated model is a version of the lifecycle model developed by Borella, De Nardi, and Yang (2017),3 which, in turn, builds
on the literature on female labor supply (including Eckstein and Liftshitz (2011),
Blundell et al. (2016a), Blundell et al (2016b), Fernandez and Wong (2017), and
Eckstein et al. (2019)). Our model is well suited for our purposes for several reasons.
It is a quantitative model that includes single and married people (with single people
meeting partners and married people risking divorce), which matters because most
people are in couples. It allows for human capital accumulation on the job, which
our findings indicate is important, and includes medical expenses and life-span risk
during retirement.
Our calibrated models matches key observed outcomes for the 1960s cohort very
well. To evaluate the effects of the observed changes that we consider, we give the
wage schedules, medical expenses, and life expectancy of the 1940s cohort to our
1960s cohort, starting at age 25, and we then study the effects of these changes on
the 1960s cohort’s labor supply, savings, and welfare.
1

Because the finding of lower life expectancy is confined to less-educated whites, we focus on this
group and to have a sample size that is large enough, we focus on non-college graduates.
2
We measure human capital at a given age as average past earnings at that age (thus, our measure
of human capital incorporates the effects of both years of schooling and work experience).
3
Borella, De Nardi, and Yang (2017) develop and estimate this model to study the effects of
marriage-based income taxes and Social Security benefits on the whole population, regardless of
education.

3

We find that, of the three changes that we consider (the observed changes in
the wage schedule, an increase in expected out-of-pocket medical expenses during
retirement, and a decrease in life expectancy), the change in the wage schedule had
by far the largest effect on the labor supply of both men and women. In particular,
it depressed the labor supply of men and increased that of women. The decrease
in life expectancy mainly reduced retirement savings but the expected increase in
out-of-pocket medical expenses increased them by more.
We also find that the welfare costs of these changes are large. Specifically, the onetime asset compensation required at age 25 to make the 1960s households indifferent
between the 1940s and 1960s health and survival dynamics, medical expenses, and
wages, expressed as a fraction of their average discounted present value of earnings,
are, 12.5, 8.0, and 7.2%, for single men, couples, and single women, respectively.4
They are thus largest for single men and smallest for single women. Looking into the
sources of these costs, we find that 47-58% of them are due to changes in the wage
structure, 25-34% are due to changing life expectancy, and that medical expenses
explain the remaining losses.
Our results thus indicate that the group of white, non-college educated people
born in the 1960s cohort, which comprises about 60% of the population of the same
age, experienced large negative changes in wages, large increases in medical expenses,
and large decreases in life expectancy and would have been much better off if they
had faced the corresponding lifetime opportunities of the 1940s birth cohort.
Our paper contributes to the previous literature along several important dimensions. First, it uncovers new facts on wages (and wages per unit of human capital),
expected medical expenses during retirement, and life expectancy in middle age, for
white, non-college-educated American men and women born in the 1940s and 1960s.
Second, it recognizes that most people are not single, isolated individuals, but rather
part of a couple and that changes in lifetime opportunities for one member of the
couple could be either reinforced or weakened by the changes faced by their partner. Third, it documents these changes and introduces them in a carefully calibrated
model that matches the lifetime outcomes of the 1960s cohort well. Fourth, it studies
the effects of these changes in opportunities over time on the savings, labor market
outcomes, and welfare of this cohort.

These computations are performed for each household one at a time, keeping fixed the assets of
their potential future partners in our benchmark.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our sample selection and
the main characteristics of our resulting sample. Section 3 documents the changing
opportunities for the 1940s and 1960s cohorts in terms of wages, medical expenses,
and life expectancy. Section 4 describes the outcomes for our 1960s cohort in terms
of labor market participation, hours worked by the workers, and savings. Section 5
discusses our structural model and thus the assumptions that we make to interpret
the data. Section 6 explains our empirical strategy and documents the processes that
we estimate as inputs of our structural model, including our estimated wages as a
function of human capital and our estimated medical expenses and mortality as a
function of age, gender, health, and marital status. Section 7 describes our results
and Section 8 concludes.

The data and our sample

We use the PSID and the HRS to construct a sample of white, non-college educated
Americans. We pick the cohort born in the 1940s (which is composed of the 1936-45
birth cohorts) as our comparison older cohort because it is the oldest cohort for which
we have excellent data over most of their life cycle (first covered in the PSID and then
in the HRS). We then pick our more recent cohort, the 1960s one (which is composed of
the 1956-65 birth cohorts), to be as young as possible, conditional on having available
data on most of their working period, which we require our structural model to match.
We then compare the lifetime opportunities between these two cohorts. Appendix A
reports more detail about the data and our computations.
To be explicit about the population that we are studying, we now turn to discussing our sampling choices for these cohorts and the resulting composition of our
sample in terms of marital status and education level. We focus on non-college graduates for two reasons. First, we want to focus on less-educated people but we need
a reasonable number of observations over the life cycle for both single and married
men and women. Second, college graduates (and above) is the only group for which
Case and Deaton (2017) find continued decreases in middle-age mortality over time.
Table 1 displays sample sizes before and after we apply our selection criteria.
We start from 30,587 people and 893,420 observations. We keep household heads
and their spouses, if present, and restrict the sample to the cohorts born between
1935 and 1965, to whites, and to include observations reporting their education. Our

results in a sample of 5,039 people and 73,944 observations.5
Turning to our resulting PSID sample, at age 25, 90% and 77% of people in the
1940s and 1960s birth cohorts are married, respectively. To understand how education
changed within our sample of interest, Table 2 reports the education distribution at
age 25 for our non-college graduates in the 1940s and 1960s cohorts. It shows that the
fraction of people without a high school diploma decreased by 40% for men and 43%
for women from the 1940s to the 1960s cohort. Our model and empirical strategy
takes into account education composition within our sample because they control for
people’s human capital, both at labor market entry and over the life cycle.

One might worry about a different type of selection, that is the one coming from
the fact that we drop people who completed college from our sample for all of our
cohorts. If college completion rates were rising fast between 1940s and 1960s, with

Thus, we also drop people with less than 16 years of education but married with someone with
16 or more years of education. Before making this selection, non-graduate husbands with a graduate
wife were 5% of the sample, while non-graduate wives with a graduate husband were 9.7% of the
sample.

the most able going into college, our 1960s cohort might be much more negatively
selected than our 1940s cohort. Table 25 in Appendix C shows that, in the PSID,
the fraction of the population having less than a college degree dropped from 83.1%
in 1940s to 77.2% in 1960s. This corresponds to a 5.9 percentage points drop in noncollege graduates in the population across our two cohorts (5.6 and 6.7 percentage
points for men and women, respectively). Appendix C also compares the implications
of our PSID and HRS samples for our model inputs with those of the corresponding
samples in which we keep a constant fraction of the population for both cohorts. All
of these comparisons show that our model inputs are very similar for both types of
samples and that our results are thus not driven by selection out of our sample.
Because the HRS contains a large number of observations and high-quality data
after age 50, we use it to compute our inputs for the retirement period. The last
available HRS wave is for 2014, which implies that we do not have complete data
on the life cycle of the two cohorts that we are interested in. In fact, individuals
ages were, respectively, 69-78 and 49-58 in the 1936-1945 and 1956-65 cohorts as of
year 2014. We use older cohorts to extrapolate outcomes for the missing periods for
our cohorts of interest and we start estimation at age 50 so that the 1960s cohort is
observed for a few waves in our sample.
Thus, our sample selection for the HRS is as follows. Of the 449,940 observations
initially present, we delete those with missing crucial information (e.g. on marital
status) and we select waves since 1996. We then select individuals in the age range
50-100. Given that we use years from 1996 to 2014, these people were born between
1906 and 1964. After keeping white and non-college-graduates and spouses, we have
19,377 individuals and 110,923 observations, as detailed in Table 3.

Changes in wages, medical expenses, and life expectancy across cohorts

In this section, we describe the observed changes in wages, medical expenses,6
and life expectancy experienced by white, non-college educated Americans born in
the 1960s compared with those born in the 1940s. We show that the wages of men
went down by 7%, while the wages of women went up by 9%. These changes do not
condition on human capital within an education group (we report wages per unit of
human capital in Section 6.1, after we make explicit how we model human capital).
We also show that, during retirement, out-of-pocket medical spending increased by
82%, while life expectancy decreased by 1.1 to 1.7 years.

Wages

Figure 1 displays smoothed average wage profiles for labor market participants.7
The left-hand-side panel displays wages for married men and women in the 1940s and
1960s cohort, while the right-hand-side panel displays the corresponding wages for
single people. Several features are worth noticing. First, the wages of men were much
higher than those of women in the 1940s birth cohort. Second, the wages of men,
both married and single, went down by 9%. Third, the wages of married and single
women went up by 7% across these two cohorts.
Our model, however, requires potential wages as an input. Because the wage
is missing for those who are not working, we impute missing wages (See details in
Appendix B). Figure 2 shows our estimated potential wage profiles. Potential wages
for men are similar to observed wages for labor market participants, except that
potential wages drop faster than observed wages after age 55. Potential wages for
women not only drop faster after middle age than observed wages, but also tend to
be lower and grow more slowly at younger ages due to positive selection of women in

All amounts in the paper are expressed in 2016 dollars.
To compute these average wage profiles, we first regress log wages on fixed-effects regressions
with a flexible polynomial in age, separately for men and women. We then regress the sum of the
fixed effects and residuals from these regressions on cohort and marital status dummies to fix the
position of the age profile. Finally, we model the variance of the shocks by fitting age polynomials
to the squared residuals from each regression in logs, and use it to compute the level of average
wages of each group as a function of age (by adding half the variance to the average in logs before
exponentiating).

Both figures display overall similar patterns and, in particular, imply that the
large wage gap between men and women in the 1940s cohort significantly decreased
for the 1960s cohort because of increasing wages for women and decreasing wages for
men.

average expected out-of-pocket medical expenses across cohorts. For instance, at age
66, out-of-pocket medical expenses expressed in 2016 dollars are $2,878 and $5,236,
respectively, for the 1940s and 1960s birth cohorts. The corresponding numbers for
someone who survives to age 90 are $5,855 and $10,655. Thus, average out-of-pocket
medical expenses after age 66 are expected to increase across cohorts by 82%. These
are dramatic increases for two cohorts that are only twenty years apart.

3.3

Life expectancy

Case and Deaton (2015 and 2017) use data from the National Vital Statistics
to study mortality by age over time and find that, interrupting a long time trend
in mortality declines, the mortality of white, middle-age, and non-college educated
Americans went up during the 1999 to 2015 time period. In particular, they found
that individuals age 55-59 in 2015 (and thus born in 1956-1960) faced a 22% increase
8

To generate this graph, we regress the logarithm of out-of-pocket medical expenses on a fixed
effect and a third-order polynomial in age. We then regress the sum of the fixed effects and residuals
from this regression on cohort dummies to compute the average effect for each cohort of interest
and we add the cohort dummies into the age profile. Finally, we model the variance of the shocks
fitting an age polynomial and cohort dummies to the squared residuals from the regression in logs,
and use it to construct average medical expenses as a function of age.

10

in mortality with respect to individuals age 55-59 in 1999 (and thus born in 19401944). Looking at a younger group, they find that individuals age 50-54 in 2015 (thus
born in 1961-1965) experienced a 28% increase in mortality compared with individuals
in the same age group and born sixteen years earlier.
Using the HRS data, we find that mortality at age 50 increased by about 27
percent from the 1940s to the 1960s cohort.9 Thus, the increases in mortality in the
HRS data are in line with those found by Case and Deaton.
To further understand the HRS’s data implications about mortality and their
changes across our two cohorts, we also report the life expectancies that are implied
by our HRS data. Table 4 shows that life expectancy at age 50 was age 77.6 and 79.8
for men and women, respectively, in the cohort born in 1940s. Conditional on being
alive at age 66, men and women in this cohort expect to live until age 82.5 and 85.7,
respectively. It also shows that the life expectancy of men at age 50 declined by 1.5
years across our two cohorts, which is a large decrease for cohorts that are twenty year
apart and during a period of increasing life expectancy for people in other groups.
The table also reveals two other interesting facts. First, the life expectancy of 50 year
old women in the same group also decreased by 1.1 years. Second, life expectancy at
age 66 fell slightly more than life expectancy at age 50 (by 1.6 years for men and 1.7
for women).

As a comparison, for the year 2005, the life tables provided by the US Department
of Health and Human Services (Arias et al., 2010) report a life expectancy at age 66
(and thus for people born in the 1940s) of 82.1 and 84.7 for white men and women
respectively. Compared to the official life tables, we thus slightly overestimate life
expectancy, especially for women, a result that possibly reflects that the HRS sample

We obtain the results in this section by estimating the probability of being alive conditional
on age and cohort and by assuming that the age profiles entering the logit regression are the same
across cohorts up to a constant. We then compute the mortality rate for the cohorts of interest

the initial sampling, people ending up in nursing homes in subsequent periods stay
in the HRS data set.
One might wonder whether people born in 1960s were aware that their life expectancy was shorter than that of previous generations. To evaluate this, we use the
HRS question about one’s subjective probability of being alive at age 75. As Table
5 shows, people born in 1960s did adjust their life expectancy downward compared
to those born in 1940s. That is, men age 55 and born in 1940s report, on average, a
subjective probability of being alive at age 75 of 61%, compared with 56% for those
born the 1960s. For women, the drop is even larger, going from 66% for those born
in 1940s to 58% for those born in the 1940s.

Labor market and savings outcomes for the 1960s
cohort

Figure 4 displays the smoothed life cycle profiles10 of participation, hours worked
by workers, and assets, for the 1960s cohort, by gender and marital status. Its left
panel highlights several important patterns. First, married men have the highest
labor market participation. Second, the participation of single men drops faster by
age than that of married men. Third, single women have a participation profile that
looks like a shifted down version of that of married men. Lastly, married women have

The smoothed profiles of participation and hours are obtained by regressing each variable on
a fourth-order polynomial in age fully interacted with marital status, and on cohort dummies, also
interacted with marital status, which pick up the position of the age profiles. For assets, the profiles
are obtained by fitting age polynomials separately for single men, single women and couples to the
logarithm of assets plus shift parameter, also controlling for cohort. The variance of the shocks is
modeled by fitting age polynomials to the squared residuals from the regression in logs and is used
to obtain the average profile in levels. Our figures display the profiles for the 1960s cohort.

the lowest participation until age 40, but it then surpasses that of single men and
single women up to age 65.
The right panel displays hours worked conditional on participation, with married
men working the most hours, followed by single men, single women, and married
women until age 60. The bottom panel of the figure displays savings accumulation
up to age 65 and shows that couples start out with more assets than singles and that
this gap widens with age, to peak at about two by retirement time.
We see these outcome as important aspects of the data that we require our model
to match in order to trust its implications about the effects of the changes in their
lifetime opportunities that we consider.

5

The model

The model that we use is a version of that in Borella, De Nardi, and Yang (2017).
Thus, we follow their exposition closely. A model period is one year long. People
start their economic life at age 25, stop working at age 66 at the latest, and live up
to age 99.
During the working stage, people choose how much to save and how much to work,
face wage shocks and, if they are married, divorce shocks. Single people meet partners.
For tractability, we make the following assumptions. People who are married to each
other have the same age. Marriage, divorce, and fertility are exogenous. Women have
an age-varying number of children that depends on their age and marital status. We
estimate all of these processes from the data.
During the retirement stage, people face out-of-pocket medical expenses which are
net of Medicare and private insurance payments, and are partly covered by Medicaid.
Married retired couples also face the risk of one of the spouses dying. Single retired
people face the risk of their own death. We allow mortality risk and medical expenses
to depend on gender, age, health status, and marital status.
We allow for both time costs and monetary costs of raising children and running
households. In terms of time costs, we allow for available time to be split between
work and leisure and to depend on gender and marital status. We interpret available
as net of home production, child care, and elderly care that one has to perform
whether working or not (and that is not easy to out-source). In addition, all workers
have to pay a fixed cost of working which depends on their age.
The monetary costs enters our model in the two ways. There is an adult-equivalent
family size that affects consumption. In addition, when women work, they have to
pay a child care cost that depends on the age and number of their children, and on
their own earnings. We assume that child care costs are a normal good: women with
higher earnings pay for more expensive child care.
We assume that households have rational expectations about all of the stochastic
processes that they face. Thus, they anticipate the nature of the uncertainty in our
environment starting from age 25, when they enter our model.

14

5.1

Preferences

Let t be age ∈ {t0 , t1 , ..., tr , ..., td }, with t0 = 25, tr = 66 being retirement time
and td = 99 being the maximum possible lifespan. For simplicity of notation think
of the model as being written for one cohort, thus age t also indexes the passing of
time for that cohort. We solve the model for our 1960s cohort and then perform our
counterfactuals by changing some of its inputs to those of the 1940s cohort.
Households have time-separable preferences and discount the future at rate β.
The superscript i denotes gender; with i = 1, 2 being a man or a woman, respectively.
The superscript j denotes marital status; with j = 1, 2 being single or in a couple,
respectively.
Each single person has preferences over consumption and leisure, and the period
flow of utility is given by the standard CRRA utility function
((ct /ηti,1 )ω lt1−ω )1−γ − 1
+b
v (ct , lt ) =
1−γ
i

where ct is consumption, ηti,j is the equivalent scale in consumption (which is a function
of family size, including children) and ηti,1 corresponds to that for singles, while b ≥ 0
is a parameter that ensures that people are happy to be alive, as in Hall and Jones
(2007). The latter allows us to properly evaluate the welfare effects of changing life
expectancy.
The term lti,j is leisure, which is given by
lti,j = Li,j − nt − Φi,j
t Int ,
where Li,j is available time endowment, which can be different for single and married
men and women and should be interpreted as available time net of home production.
Leisure equals available time endowment less nt , hours worked on the labor market,
less the fixed time cost of working. That is, the term Int is an indicator function
which equals 1 when hours worked are positive and zero otherwise, while the term
Φi,j
t represents the fixed time cost of working.
The fixed cost of working should be interpreted as including commuting time, time
spent getting ready for work, and so on. We allow it to depend on gender, marital
status and age because working at different ages might imply different time costs for
married and single men and women. We assume the following functional form, whose
15

three parameters we calibrate using our structural model,
Φi,j
t =

i,j
i,j 2
exp(φi,j
0 + φ1 t + φ2 t )
i,j
i,j 2 .
1 + exp(φi,j
0 + φ1 t + φ2 t )

We assume that couples maximize their joint utility function
w(ct , lt1 , lt2 )

((ct /ηti,2 )ω (lt2 )1−ω )1−γ − 1
((ct /ηti,2 )ω (lt1 )1−ω )1−γ − 1
+b+
+ b.
=
1−γ
1−γ

Note that for couples the economy of scale term ηti,2 is the same for both genders.

5.2

The environment

Households hold assets at , which earn rate of return r. The timing is as follows. At
the beginning of each working period, each single individual observes his/her current
idiosyncratic wage shock, age, assets, and accumulated earnings. Each married person
also observes their partner’s labor wage shock and accumulated earnings. At the
beginning of each retirement period, each single individual observes his/her current
age, assets, health, and accumulated earnings. Each married person also observes
their partner’s health and accumulated earnings. Decisions are made after everything
has been observed and new shocks hit at the end of the period after decisions have
been made.
5.2.1

Human capital and wages

We take education at age 25 as given but explicitly model human capital accumulation after that age. To do so, we define human capital, ȳti , as one’s average
past earnings at each age. Thus, our definition of human capital implies that it is a
function of one’s initial wages and schooling and subsequent labor market experience
and wages.11
There are two components to wages. The first is a deterministic function of human
i
i
capital: ei,j
t (ȳt ). The second component is a persistent earnings shock t that evolves
as follows
ln it+1 = ρiε ln it + υti , υti ∼ N (0, (συi )2 ).
11

It also has the important benefit of allowing us to have only one state variable keeping track of
human capital and Social Security contributions.

16

i
The product of ei,j
t (·) and t determines an agent’s hourly wage.

5.2.2

Marriage and divorce

During the working period, a single person gets married with an exogenous probability which depends on his/her age and gender. The probability of getting married
i
at the beginning of next period is νt+1
.
Conditional on meeting a partner, the probability of meeting a partner p with
wage shock pt+1 is
(1)
ξt+1 (·) = ξt+1 (pt+1 |it+1 , i).
Allowing this probability to depend on the wage shock of both partners generates
assortative mating. We assume random matching over assets at+1 and average acp
cumulated earnings of the partner ȳt+1
, conditional on partner’s wage shock. We
estimate the distribution of partners over these state variables from the PSID data
(see Appendix B, Marriage and divorce probabilities subsection, for details) and denote it by
p
θt+1 (·) = θt+1 (apt+1 , ȳt+1
|pt+1 ),
(2)
p
where the variables apt+1 , ȳt+1
, pt+1 stand for partner’s assets, human capital, and wage
shock, respectively.
A working-age couple can be hit by a divorce shock at the end of the period that
depends on age, ζt . If the couple divorces, they split the assets equally and each of the
ex-spouses moves on with those assets and their own wage shock and Social Security
contributions.
After retirement, single people don’t get married anymore. People in couples no
longer divorce and can lose their spouse only because of death. This is consistent
with the data because in this cohort marriages and divorces after retirement are rare.

5.2.3

The costs of raising children and running a household

Consistently with the data for this cohort, we assume that single men do not
have children. We keep track of the total number of children and children’s age as a
function of mother’s age and marital status. The total number of children by one’s age
affects the economies of scale of single women and couples. We denote by f 0,5 (i, j, t)
and f 6,11 (i, j, t) the number of children from 0 to 5 and from 6 to 11, respectively.

17

The term τc0,5 is the child care cost for each child age 0 to 5, while τc6,11 is the child
care cost for each child age 6 to 11. Both are expressed as fraction of the earnings of
the working mother.
The number of children between ages 0 to 5 and 6 to 11, together with the perchild child care costs by age of child, determine the child care costs of working mothers
(i = 2). Because we assume that child care costs are proportional to earnings, if a
woman does not work her earnings are zero and so are her child care costs. This
amounts to assuming that she provides the child care herself.
5.2.4

Medical expenses and death

After retirement, surviving people face medical expenses, health, and death shocks.
At age 66, we endow people with a distribution of health that depends on their marital
status and gender (See Appendix B, Health status at retirement subsection).
Health status ψti can be either good or bad and evolves according to a Markov
process πti,j (ψti ) that depends on age, gender, and marital status. Medical expenses
i,j
i
i
mi,j
t (ψt ) and survival probabilities st (ψt ) are functions of age, gender, marital status,
and health status.
5.2.5

Initial conditions

We take the fraction of single and married people at age 25 and their distribution
over the relevant state variables from the PSID data. We list all of our state variables
in Section 5.4.

5.3

The Government

We model taxes on total income Y as Gouveia and Strauss (1994) and we allow
them to depend on marital status as follows
T (Y, j) = (bj − bj (sj Y + 1)

−

1
pj

)Y.

The government also uses a proportional payroll tax τtSS on labor income, up to a
Social Security cap yet , to help finance old-age Social Security benefits. We allow both
the payroll tax and the Social Security cap to change over time for the 1960 cohort,
as in the data.

18

We use human capital ȳti (computed as an individual’s average earnings at age t)
to determine both wages and old age Social Security payments. While Social Security
benefits for a single person are a function of one’s average lifetime earnings, Social
Security benefits for a married person are the highest of one’s own benefit entitlement
and half of the spouse’s entitlement while the other spouse is alive (spousal benefit).
After one’s spousal death, one’s Social Security benefits are given by the highest of
one’s benefit entitlement and the deceased spouse’s (survival benefit).
The insurance provided by Medicaid and SSI in old age is represented by a meanstested consumption floor, c(j).12

5.4

Recursive formulation

We define and compute six sets of value functions: the value function of workingage singles, the value function of retired singles, the value function of working-age
couples, the value function of retired couples, the value function of an individual who
is of working-age and in a couple, the value function of an individual who is retired
and in a couple.
5.4.1

The singles: working age and retirement

The state variables for a single individual during one’s working period are age t,
gender i, assets ait , the persistent earnings shock it , and average realized earnings ȳti .
The corresponding value function is
W s (t, i, ait , it , ȳti ) = max

The expectation of the value function next period if one remains single integrates
over one’s wage shock next period. When one gets married, not only we take a similar
expectation, but we also integrate over the distribution of the state variables of one’s
partner (ξt+1 (pt+1 |it+1 , i) is the distribution of the partner’s wage shock defined in
Equation (1) and θt+1 (·) is the distribution of partner’s assets and human capital
defined in Equation (2)).
The value function Ŵ c is the discounted present value of the utility for the same
individual, once he or she is in a married relationship with someone with given state
variables, not the value function of the married couple, which counts the utility of
both individuals in the relationship. We discuss the computation of the value function
of an individual in a marriage later in this section.
Equation 5 shows that the deterministic component of wages is a function of age,
gender, marital status, and human capital.
Equation 9 describes the evolution of human capital, which we measure as average
accumulated earnings (up to the Social Security earnings cap yet ) and that we use as
a determinant of future wages and Social Security payments after retirement.
During the last working period, a person takes the expected values of the value
functions during the first period of retirement. The state variables for a retired
single individual are age t, gender i, assets ait , health ψti , and average realized lifetime
earnings ȳri . Because we assume that the retired individual can no longer get married,
his or her recursive problem can be written as

function of the income earned during their work life, ȳri and the fnction B(at , Yti , ψti , c(j))

ensure a minimum consumption floor c(j).

5.4.2

The couples: working age and retirement

The state variables for a married couple in the working stage are (t, at , 1t , 2t , ȳt1 , ȳt2 )
where 1 and 2 refer to gender, and the recursive problem for the married couple (j = 2)

The expected value of the couple’s value function is taken with respect to the conditional probabilities of the two t+1 s given the current values of the t s for each of the
spouses (we assume independent draws). The expected values for the newly divorced
people are taken using the appropriate conditional distribution for their own labor
wage shocks.
During their last working period, couples take the expected values of the value
functions for the first period of retirement. During retirement, that is from age tr
on, each of the spouses is hit with a health shock ψti and a realization of the survival
1,2
i

shock si,2
t (ψt ). Symmetrically with the other shocks, st (ψt ) is the after retirement
survival probability of husband, while st2,2 (ψt2 ) is the survival probability of the wife.
We assume that the health shocks of each spouse are independent of each other and
that the death shocks of each spouse are also independent of each other.
In each period, the married couple’s (j = 2) recursive problem during retirement
can be written as

the spouse’s entitlement. In equation (28), ȳ¯r represents survivorship benefits from
Social Security in case of death of one of the spouses. The survivor has the right to
collect the higher of own benefit entitlement and the deceased spouse’s entitlement.
5.4.3

The individuals in couples: working age and retirement

We have to compute the joint value function of the couple to appropriately compute joint labor supply and savings under the married couples’ available resources.
However, when computing the value of getting married for a single person, the relevant object for that person is his or her the discounted present value of utility in the
marriage. We thus compute this object for person of gender i who is married with a
specific partner

with the given state variables.

Estimation and calibration

We calibrate our model to match the data for the 1960s birth cohort by using a
two-step strategy, as Gourinchas and Parker (2003) and De Nardi, French, and Jones
23

(2010 and 2016). Then, in a third step, as De Nardi, Pashchenko, and Porappakkarm
(2017), we calibrate the parameter b, which affects the utility of being alive. It
is important to note that this parameter does not change our decision rules and
the data that we match and can thus be calibrated after the other parameters are
calibrated. Nonetheless, it is necessary to calibrate it to properly evaluate welfare
when life expectancy changes.

More specifically, in the third step, we choose b so that the value of statistical life
(VSL) implied by our model is the middle of the range estimated by the empirical
literature. The VSL is defined as the compensation that people require to bear an
increase in their probability of death, expressed as “dollars per death.” For example,
suppose that people are willing to tolerate an additional fatality risk of 1/10, 000
during a given period for a compensation of $500 per person. Among 10,000 people
there will be one death and it will cost the society 10,000 times $500 = $5 million,
which is the implied VSL.

6.1

First-step calibration and estimation for the 1960s cohort

In the first step, we use the data to compute the initial distributions of our model’s
state variables and estimate or calibrate the parameters that can be identified outside
our model. For instance, we estimate the probabilities of marriage, divorce, health
transitions, and death, the number and age of children by maternal age and marital
status, the wage processes, and medical expenses during retirement.
Our calibrated parameters are listed in Table 6. We set the interest rate r to
4% and the utility curvature parameter, γ, to 2.5. The equivalence scales are set to
ηti,j = (j + 0.7 ∗ fti,j )0.7 , as estimated by Citro and Michael (1995). The term fti,j is
the average total number of children for single and married men and women by age.
We use the tax function for married and single people estimated by Guner et al.
(2012). The retirement benefits at age 66 are calculated to mimic the Old Age and
Survivor Insurance component of the Social Security system. The most recent paper
estimating the consumption floor during retirement is the one estimated by De Nardi
et al (2016) in a rich model of retirement with endogenous medical expenses. In
their framework, they estimate a utility floor that corresponds to consuming $4,600
a year when healthy. However, they note that Medicaid recipients are guaranteed
a minimum income of $6,670. As a compromise, we use $5,900 as our consumption
floor for elderly singles, which is $8,687 in 2016 dollars, and the one for couples to be
1.5 the amount for singles, which is the statutory ratio between benefits of couples to
singles.
In the subsections that follow, we describe the estimation of our wage functions,
medical expenses, and survival probabilities. More details about all of our first-step
inputs are in Appendix B.

on a fixed effect dk , a polynomial f in age t for each gender i, gender-cohort dummies
Dg interacted with human capital ȳkt and a shift parameter δy (to be able to take
logs). Thus, we allow all coefficients to be gender-specific and for the coefficient on
human capital to also depend on cohort.
We then regress the sum of the fixed effects and the residuals for each person on
cohort and marital status dummies and their interactions, separately for each gender,
and use the estimated effects for gender, marital status, and cohort as shifters for the
wage profiles of each demographic group and cohort.

14
As we do not observe the complete profile for those born in 1960s, the shape of the age profile

26

largest age effect for men is at age 60, when their potential wage declines by 1.3%.
Women’s potential wages, instead, grow on average by half a percentage point until
age 50 and decline only mildly around age 60.
In terms of the position of the age profile, the effect of being born in the 1960s
cohort instead of the 1940s cohort is large and negative, especially for married and
single men. Because these declines depend on one’s human capital level, we discuss
their magnitudes when illustrating the interaction between wages and human capital
for the two cohorts in Figure 5. In contrast to this decline, however, returns to human
capital went up for the 1960s cohort compared to the 1940s cohort, as our estimated
elasticity of wages to human capital increases from 0.256 and 0.363 for the 1940s
cohort to 0.347 and 0.413 for the 1960s one, respectively for men and women.
To better understand the implications of our estimates by cohort and sub-group,
Figure 5 reports our estimated average wage profiles by age conditional on a fixed
level of human capital during all of the working period. The human capital levels over
which we condition are the 0th , 25th , 50th , 75th , and 99th percentiles of the distributions
of average accumulated earnings of men and women in our sample. They correspond
to, respectively, $0, $30,100, $41,300, $51,600, and $79,100 for men and to $0, $5,000,
$13,900, $23,700, and $55,900 for women (expressed in 2016 dollars). In these graphs,
therefore, human capital is held fixed by age. The top graphs are for married people
and the bottom ones refer to singles. The graphs on the left are for men and those
on the right for women. The solid lines refer to the 1960s cohort, while the dashed
ones to the 1940s cohort.
In sum, these graphs display wages as a function of age for single and married
men and women in our two cohorts for five fixed levels of human capital. Hence,
they illustrate the changes in the returns to human capital across cohorts and marital
status for various human capital levels.
Focusing on married men with zero human capital (the lowest two lines in the top
graph on the left), the effect of the lower position of the age profile for the 1960s cohort
is apparent: married men entering the labor market receive an average potential
hourly wage that is 3.5 dollars lower than that received by the same men in the 1940s
cohort. At higher levels of human capital, the disadvantage is progressively reduced
by the higher returns to human capital but is still not enough to counterbalance the
drop in the level of all wages. Even at the highest level of human capital within the
is assumed to be the same across generations.

27

non-college graduate group the hourly wage for married men born in the 1960s is still
90 cents lower than those received by the same men in the 1960s. The bottom left
panel displays the wages of single men and shows that their drops are even larger
than those for married men at all human capital levels.
The right panels refer to the wages of women. The wages of married women
(top panel) with zero human capital went down by about 0.9 dollars, a much smaller
decrease across cohorts than that for men, both in absolute value and in percentage
terms. As a consequence of the increased returns to human capital, at the median
human capital level for women, their wage is 0.6 dollars lower, while it is actually
higher for the high-human capital women in the 1960s than the 1940s cohort, by
0.3 dollars. The main difference between married and single women is that, from
the 1940s to the 1960s, only married women in the top 1% of the human capital
distribution experienced a wage increase, while single women in the top 15% of the
human capital distribution experienced a wage increase.
In sum, we find that men and women in the 1960s cohort had a higher return
to human capital but a lower cohort-and-gender-age wage profiles compared to those
born in the 1940s. The latter drop was especially large for men. These changes
imply that men and women with lower human capital had the largest drop, that
wages dropped for men at all human capital levels, and that the wages of the highest
human capital women increased. As a result of these changes in the wage structure
and a larger increase in women’s human capital (partly due to more years of education
and partly to more labor market experience), average wages over the life cycle, shown
in Figure 2, were higher for women and lower for men in the 1960s cohort.

over-time characteristics that may bias the age profile, such as differential mortality,
as discussed in De Nardi, French and Jones (2010). We then regress the residuals
from this equation on cohort, gender, and marital status dummies to compute the
average effect for each group of interest. Hence, the profile of the logarithm of medical
expenses is constant across cohorts up to a constant.
Table 8 reports the results from our estimates for medical expenses16 and shows
that after age 66 real medical expenses increase with age on average by 2.4 and 2.6

those born in the 1960s cohort face medical expenses that are 48.6 percent higher
than those born in the 1940s cohort, even after conditioning on health status.
6.1.3

Life expectancy

As described in our model section, we allow mortality to depend on health, gender,
marital status, and age, and we have health evolving over time, depending on previous
health, age, gender, and marital status. We allow cohort effects to affect all of these
dynamics and their initial conditions, both in our estimation of these inputs, and in
our model.
More specifically, we model the probability of being alive at time t as a logit
function
exp(Xts0 β s )
st = P rob(Alivet = 1 | Xts ) =
.
1 + exp(Xts0 β s )
that we estimate using the HRS data. Among the explanatory variables, we include
a third-order polynomial in age, gender, marital status, and health status in the
previous period, as well as interactions between these variables and age, whenever
they are statistically different from zero. We also include cohort dummies and use
coefficients relative to the cohort of interest to adjust the constant accordingly.17
17
We are thus assuming that the age profiles entering our estimated equation are the same across
cohorts up to a constant. We then compute the mortality rate for the cohorts of interest using the
appropriate cohort dummy.

30

To investigate the implications of the cohort effects that we estimate through
these pathways, Table 9 reports the model-implied life expectancy at age 66 and
their changes when we add, in turn, the changes in mortality, health dynamics, initial
health at age 66 and initial fractions of married and single people that are driven by
cohort effects on each of those components.
The first line of the table reports life expectancy using all of the inputs that we
estimate for the 1960s cohort. Their implied life expectancy is very close to the one
we have computed using the data and a much simpler regression for mortality and
reported in Section 3.3. The second line changes the observed relationship between
mortality and health and demographics from the one we estimate for the 1960s cohort
to the one we estimate for the 1940s cohort. It shows that this change alone implies
an increase of 0.8 and 0.7 years of life for men and women, respectively. In line three,
we switch from the 1960s to the 1940s health dynamics and there is no noticeable
change in life expectancy because the health dynamics are very similar. In line 4,
we change the fraction of people who are in bad health at age 66, conditional on
marital status, to that of the 1940s cohort. This change implies a further increase of
0.1 years of life expectancy for both men and women, indicating that a smaller part
of the observed decrease in life expectancy at age 66 is captured by changing health
conditions at age 66. The last line of the table not only changes initial health at age
66, but also allows for the fact that more people were married in the 1940s cohort
compared to the 1960s cohort. This change in the fraction of married people at age
66 explains an additional change or 0.3 and 0.2 years of life for men and women,
respectively.

Our decomposition thus shows that the biggest change in life expectancy in our
31

framework comes from a change in the relationship between mortality and health
dynamics after age 66, while a smaller one stems from a worsening of initial health
status at age 66. Finally, the reduction in the fraction of married people also has a
non-negligible effect on life expectancy of both men and women. In our experiments
changing life expectancy, we do not change marital status at age 25 and we thus
abstract from the effects of the small changes in life expectancy coming from that
channel.

In the second step, we calibrate 19 model parameters (β, ω, (φi,j
0 , φ1 , φ2 ), (τc , τc
i,j
L ) so that our model mimics the observed life-cycle patterns of labor market participation, hours worked conditional on working, and savings for married and single
men and women that we report in Figure 4.
Table 10 presents our calibrated preference parameters for the 1960s cohort. Our
calibrated discount factor is 0.981 and our calibrated weight on consumption is 0.416.
We normalize available time for single men to 5840 hours a year (112.3 hours a
week) and calibrate available time for single women and married women and men.
Our calibration implies that single women have the same time endowment as single
men (112 hours a week). The corresponding time endowments for married men and
women are, respectively, 105 and 88 hours. This implies that people in the latter two
groups spend 7 and 24 hours a week, respectively, in non-market activities such as
running households, raising children, and taking care of aging parents. Our estimates
of non-market work time are similar to those reported by Aguiar and Hurst (2007)
and by Dotsey, Li, and Yang (2014).
Our estimates for the 1960s cohort imply that the per-child child care cost of
having a child age 0-5 and 6-11 are, respectively, 35% and 3.0% of a woman’s earnings.
In the PSID data, child care costs are not broken down by age of the child, but perchild child care costs (for all children in the age range 0-11) of a married woman are
33% and 19% of her earnings at ages 25 and 30, respectively. Computing our model’s
implications, we find that per-child child care costs (for all children in the age range
0-11) of a married woman are 30% and 23% of her earnings, respectively, at ages 25
and 30. Thus, our model infers child care costs that are similar to those in the PSID
data.

6.3

Third-step calibration

To match the VSL, we proceed as follows. Because in our model we do not have
mortality until age 66, we review the value of statistical life estimated for older people
in previous empirical work. Within this literature, O’Brien (2013) estimates the value
of statistical life by examining consumer automobile purchases by individuals up to
85 years old. He finds that the VSL is respectively $8 million for the age 65-74 age

33

group and $7 million for the 75-85 age group (expressed in year 2009 dollars). Alberini
et al. (2004), instead, use contingent valuation surveys, which elicited respondents’
willingness to pay for reductions of mortality risk of different magnitudes, and find
values between $1 and $5 million for the 40 to 75 age group (expressed in year 2000
dollars). Thus, the range from these two papers, expressed in year 2016 dollars
(the base year that we use in this paper) is between $1 and $9 million. Then, we
choose b = 0.009 so that when we increase mortality after retirement and compute a
compensation that makes them indifferent between this counterfactual case and our
benchmark mortality, we obtain an average VSL at age 66 of $5 million.

6.4

Model fit

Figures 7 and 8 report our model-implied moments, as well as the moments and
95% confidence intervals from the PSID data for our 1960s cohort. They show that
our parsimoniously parameterized model (19 parameters and 448 targets) fits the
data well and reproduces the important patterns of participation, hours conditional
on participation, and asset accumulation for all of four demographic groups.

7

The effects of changing wages, medical expenses,
and life expectancy

We now turn to evaluating the effects of the changes in wages, medical expenses,
and life expectancy that we have documented. Because we want to isolate the effects
of these changes on the 1960s cohort (while keeping everything else constant for this
cohort), we only replace these three sets of inputs with those experienced by 1940s
cohort, first one at a time, and then all at the same time. In doing so, we assume that,
as of age 25, the 1960s cohort have rational expectations about all of the stochastic
processes that they face over the rest of their lives, including when we switch some
of them to their 1940s counterparts.
We start by studying the implications of these changes for labor participation,
hours worked by workers, and savings for single and married men and women. Then,
to evaluate welfare, we compute a one-time asset compensation to be given upon
entering the model, that is at age 25, that makes household endowed with a given set

Changing wages

Figure 9 compares the participation, hours worked by workers, and savings for
the 1960s cohort under their own wage schedule and under the wage schedule of the
1940s cohort. It shows that, according to our model, all of these economic outcomes
would have been rather different under the 1940s wage schedule.
The largest effects occurred for married couples, with many more married women
participating and working more hours under the 1960s wage schedule, while their
husbands dropped out of the labor force at younger ages. At age 25, for instance,
the participation of married women was 8 percentage points higher. Married men’s
participation started dropping faster after age 30 and was four percentage points
lower than under the 1940s wage schedule at age 55. Hours worked by young married
women were about 100 hours a year higher, while hours worked by young married
men were only slightly higher. These changes were due to much lower wages for men,
in conjunction with increasing returns to human capital. The latter, in particular,
increased the returns to working when young.
Single people were affected too. They were experiencing lower wages, for the most
part, and in the case of single women, they were also expecting to get married with

36

lower-wage husbands. This negative wealth effect makes them invest more in their
own human capital, work harder when young, and receive higher wages because of
higher human capital accumulation. Single men reacted little to these changes by
marginally reducing their participation, increasing hours worked while young, and
reducing them after age 50.
As a result of the changing wage schedule and endogenous labor market decisions,
average discounted lifetime income decreased by $115,000 (10%) for single men and
$108,000 (9%) for married men, but increased by $28,000 (5%) for single women
and $36,000 (7%) for married women. As households experienced the large negative
wealth effect coming from lower wages and earnings, retirement savings were much
lower. Assets at age 66 dropped by 21% for single men, 1.1% for single women, and
6.1% for couples, respectively.

income. Top panel, our benchmark economy, bottom panel, an economy without
marriage and divorce after age 25

We now turn to evaluating how much worse (or better off) were people under the
1960s rather than the 1940s wage schedule.19 We start by studying the effects of
the wage changes for men only. In this case everyone loses, and the one-time asset
compensation that we should give to 25 year old to make them indifferent between
the two wage schedules for men, are $68,300 for single men, $17,800 for single women,
and $64,800 for couples. The first line of Table 11 reports these compensations as a
fraction of the present value of lifetime income for each group. They amount to 6.8%,
2.9%, and 4.0% for single men, single women, and couples, respectively.
We then turn to the welfare effects of having the wages of both men and women
19

When changing the wage schedule, we keep everything else (including initial conditions and
prospective spouses) fixed at the levels experienced by the 1960s cohort.

Figure 9: Model outcomes with 1960s and 1940s wage schedule

set to the 1960s instead of 1940s wage schedules. Again, virtually everyone loses as
a result. The one-time asset compensation that we should give to the 25 year old
to make them indifferent between the 1940s and the 1960s wages, are $72,900 for
single men, $20,400 for single women, and $73,600 for couples. The second line of
Table 11 reports these compensations as a fraction of lifetime income for each group.
They amount to 7.3%, 3.4%, and 4.5% for single men, single women, and couples,
respectively. Thus, everyone loses and the welfare losses are big both in absolute
value and when compared with the discounted value of lifetime income in each group.
To isolate the welfare effects coming from marriage and divorce dynamics, we also
38

compute an economy in which there is no marriage and divorce after age 25. In it, a
25-year-old single person stays single forever, and a 25-year-old married couple stays
married forever.20 The last two lines of Table 11 report the welfare losses of the losers
as a fraction of the present discounted value of lifetime income for each group.
When men’s wages drop in this economy, all men and couples lose as a result. The
one-time asset compensation that we should give to the 25 year old to make them
indifferent between the 1940s and the 1960s men’s wages when there is no marriage
and divorce, are $98,800 for single men, $0 for single women, and $72,000 for couples,
respectively. When the wages of both men and women change, all single men and
almost all couples lose, while 38% of single women gain. The single women who gain
are the high-human capital one end up with higher wages. The welfare compensations
for those who lose when all wages change are, respectively, $98,800 for single men,
$5,400 for single women, and $80,500 for couples, respectively. The average welfare
gain among the 38% of single women who gain is $6,400.
Compared with our benchmark economy, in an economy without marital dynamics
after age 25 single men experience a larger welfare loss due to their much lower wages
and their inability to benefit from a future working spouse. In contrast, 38% of single
women gain when their wage goes up (those with high human capital), while the
other single women experience a smaller welfare loss because, while their wage goes
down, they no longer get married with much lower-wages husband and thus do not
work as hard to help support their family.

7.2

Changes in medical expenses

We now turn to studying the effects of replacing the out-of-pocket medical expenses faced by the 1960s cohort with those faced by the 1940s cohort. The present
discounted value of medical expenses at age 25 for the 1960s cohort went up by
$5,000, $7,000, and $12,300 for single men, single women, and couples, respectively,
compared with the 1940s cohort. This corresponds to a 76% increase for single men,
single women, and couples.
The main noticeable effects of these changes are that hours worked by married
women in the 1960s cohort under the 1960s inputs are slightly higher after age 30
while those of single women, who are poorer and rely on the consumption floor more,
20

To isolate the effect of wage changes, we eliminate marriage and divorce dynamics after age 25
both from the baseline and the counterfactual economies when performing these welfare comparisons.

39

go down after age 55. Also, savings at age 66 were 14%, 11%, and 16% higher for
single men, single women and couples in the 1960s cohort than they would have been
under the lower medical expenses experienced by the 1940s cohort.

Figure 10: Model outcomes with 1960s and 1940s medical expenses

Turning to our welfare computations, the resulting one-time asset compensation
that we should give to 25 year old to make them indifferent between the 1940s and
the 1960s medical expenses, are $14,000 for single men, $6,000 for single women, and
$14,900 for couples. These numbers correspond, respectively, to 1.4%, 1.0%, and 0.9%
of the present discounted value of their lifetime income. Despite the similar change
in medical expenses for single men and women, the compensation is smaller for single
40

women because they are poorer and rely on the consumption floor more. Thus, to
the extent that they are at the consumption floor, how large their medical expenses
are, is not very important to then.

7.3

Changes in life expectancy

We endow the 1960s cohort with the mortality, that is, health initial, health transition, and survival function, and thus life expectancy, of the 1940s cohort. Because
we estimate out-of-pocket medical expenses as a function of age, gender, and health,
changing a cohort’s health and survival dynamics also changes its medical expenses.
In fact, moving from the 1940s to the 1960s health and survival dynamics not only
lowers survival, but, because people die off faster, also decreases the present discounted value of medical expenses at age 25 by $600 (4.5%) for single men, by $670
(4.0%) for single women and $1,300 (4.3%) for couples. Thus, both life expectancy
and medical expenses go down as a result of these changes across cohorts.
Figure 11 compares the participation and hours of married and single men and
women under the two scenarios. It shows that participation and hours would have
been very similar under the two scenarios but that retirement savings would have been
6.4%, 6.0%, and 4.1% higher for single men, single women and couples, respectively
higher at retirement time under the 1940s health and survival dynamics. Thus savings
go down, as one might expect, because of the shorter time period over which people
expect to have to finance retirement consumption and decreased medical spending.
Given that, in contrast, the life expectancy of college educated (and their medical
expenses) went up over time, this change contributes to increasing the gap in their
retirement savings and thus wealth inequality across these education groups.
Hall and Jones (2007) and De Nardi, Paschenko, and Porappakkarm (2017) find
that changes in life expectancy can have large effects on welfare. One mitigating
factor in our framework is that this lower life expectancy occurred together with
lower medical expenses. In our model medical expenses are a shock reducing available
resources; thus, reducing them increases welfare. This counters the loss in welfare due
to a shorter lifespan.
We find the welfare cost due to a shorter life expectancy dominates the welfare
gain from reduced medical expenses and that all single men and women and married
couples lose welfare as a result. More specifically, the one-time asset compensation

All three changes together

As we have seen from our previous three decomposition exercises, changes in the
wage schedule had the largest effects on participation, hours, savings, and welfare.

42

The other two changes that we consider, the decrease in life expectancy and increase
in expected out-of-pocket medical costs mostly affect retirement savings and partly
offset each other. They still have, however, very sizeable welfare costs.

Figure 12: Model outcomes with all changes we consider

The effects of all of these changes together on the labor market participation
imply large increases in participation of both married and single women, noticeable
decreases in the participation of married men after age 40, and almost no changes in
the participation of single men. Hours worked by married men and women changed
in opposite directions, while the hours of single men and women displayed some
increases earlier on in their working period. On net, these changes depressed the
43

retirement savings of single men, while leaving those of couples and single women
roughly unchanged.

Table 12 compares outcomes for 1960s cohort. Under the 1960s inputs (wage
schedules, medical expenses, and life expectancies), the participation rates of married
women over their working period were 3.12 percentage points higher than under the
1940s wage schedule, while that of married men were 2.42 percentage points lower.
Overall, participation was only 0.12 percentage points higher due to offsetting changes
across groups. Hours worked conditional on participation, instead, were higher for all
groups and especially for married women, resulting in an additional 1.95% of hours
worked over the life cycle for this group.

as one-time asset compensation at age 25 and expressed as a fraction of the
discounted present value of one’s income. SM = single men, SW = Single
women

As a result of all three changes together, the present discounted value of income
went down, by 9.9%, 4.6%, and 4.0% for single men, single women, and couples
and the one-time welfare loss experience by people in the 1960s cohort amounts to
$126,000 for single men, $44,000 for single women, and $132,000 for couples. The
44

fourth line of Table 13 reports that these numbers expressed as a fraction of their
average discounted present value of earnings are, 12.5%, 7.2%, and 8.1%, respectively.
Thus, the resulting welfare loss due to the changes between the 1940s and the 1960s
birth cohort are very large.
Table 13 summarizes key information about the welfare losses and their sources.
The first columns shows, for instance, that 58.4% of the total welfare loss that we
consider for single men comes from wage changes and 25.6% comes from their decrease
in life expectancy. The second column shows that, for single women, 47.2% of the
welfare loss for single women comes from wage changes (their own and those of their
prospective husbands), and that 33.3% of it comes from decreased life expectancy.
The last column refers to couples and shows 55.6% of the welfare loss for couples
comes from wage changes and 25.3% comes decreased life expectancy.
The last line of the table considers all changes together in an economy without
marital dynamics after age 25 and finds that the welfare loss of single men is higher
and that of single women lower when they have no expectations of getting married in
the future. When couples no longer divorce, their welfare loss is higher because the
wife works harder and no longer gets divorced.

Conclusions and directions for future research

Of the three changes that we consider, that is wages, out-of-pocket medical expenses during retirement, and life expectancy, we find that the observed changes in
the wage schedule had by far the largest effect on the labor supply of men and women
born in the 1960s cohort. Specifically, it depressed the labor supply of men and increased that of women, especially in married couples. The decrease in life expectancy
mainly reduced retirement savings, while the expected increase in out-of-pocket medical expenses increased them. On net, these two changes taken together had overall
modest effects on all of the outcomes that we consider, including savings.
We also find that the combined effect of the changes have large welfare costs. In
fact, the one-time asset compensation required to make 25-year-old households indifferent between the 1940s and 1960s health and survival dynamics, medical expenses,
and wages are $126,000 for single men, $44,000 for single women, and $132,000 for
couples. The corresponding numbers expressed as a fraction of their average discounted present value of earnings are, 12.5%, 7.2%, and 8.0%, respectively. Lower
45

wages explain 47-58% of these losses, shorter life expectancies explain 26-34%, and
higher medical expenses account for the rest.
Other interesting changes took place for the same cohorts, including in the number
of children, marriage and divorce patterns, assortative mating, child care costs, initial
conditions at age 25, and time spent in home production and raising children. Our
paper suggests that studying the opportunities and outcomes of people in different
cohorts and across different groups is a topic worthy of investigation, including from
a macroeconomic standpoint.
We focus on the population of white and non-college educated Americans to bring
to bear a large and relatively homogenous population to our structural model and
study its implications. However, white non-college educated are hardly the only
disadvantaged population losing ground over time in the U.S. Derek Neal (2006)
extensively documents that while black-white skill gaps diminished over most of the
20th century, important measures of these gaps have not dropped since the late 1980s.
A significant literature also documents a dramatic decline in employment rates and a
lack of wage growth among less-skilled black men over the past four decades or more
(see Neal and Rick (2016) and Bayer and Charles (2018)). However, this literature
does not employ structural models that facilitate analyses of trends in aggregate
welfare or overall inequality.
While employment rates for less-skilled black and white men were falling, incarceration rates were rising. However, these rising incarceration rates did not reflect rising
levels of criminal activity. Neal and Rick (2014 and 2016) show that the prison boom,
which began around 1980, was primarily the result of policy changes that increased
the severity of punishment for all types of criminal offenders. These changes more
than doubled the incarceration rates of young black and white men. As a result, a
much larger fraction of the current generation of less-educated Americans have spent
time in prison, and only the future can reveal the total impact of these prison experiences on their lifetime earnings and consumption (Holzer 2009). Thinking about
crime and related policies and their effects in the context of structural models is an
important extension to better understand the economic outcomes of disadvantaged
populations.
Fella and Gallipoli (2014) estimate a rich life cycle model with endogenous education and crime choices to study the effects of two large-scale policy interventions
aimed at reducing crime by the same amount: subsidizing high school education and
46

increasing the length of prison sentences. They find that increases in high school
graduation rates entails large efficiency and welfare gains which are absent if the
same crime reduction is achieved by increasing the length of sentences. Intuitively,
the efficiency gains of the subsidy come from its effect on the education composition
of the labor force. No such effect is present in the case of a longer prison term.
Another important observation is that low income individuals are both more likely
to develop a severe work-limiting disability and more likely to apply for disability
insurance when they are not severely disabled. Low and Pistaferri (2015) find that by
age 60, the low educated are 2.5 times more likely to be disability insurance claimants
than the high educated (17% vs. 7%). In addition, a large increase in disability
enrollment has been taking place over time, going from 2.2 percent in the late 1970s
to 3.5 percent in the years immediately preceding the 2007-2009 recession and 4.4
percent in 2013 (Libman, 2015). Michaud and Wiczer (2018) study the increase in
disability claims of men over time in the context of a structural model and evaluate
the importance of changing macroeconomic conditions in driving it. They find the
secular deterioration of economic conditions concentrated in populations with high
health risks accounts for a third of the increase in aggregate disability claims for men.
These changes occurred in conjunction with the rise of participation (and disability
claiming) of women. Gallipoli and Turner (2011) show that marriage interacts with
health and disability shocks in an important way and that single workers’ labor supply
responses to disability shocks are larger and more persistent than those of married
workers. Thus, enriching our framework to allow for health shocks during the working
period and disability insurance is an important area of research to better understand
the changing opportunities and outcomes of the most disadvantaged groups.

Appendix A. Data and methodology
We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the wage process,
the marriage and divorce probabilities, the initial distribution of couples and singles
over state variables, and the sample moments that we match using our structural
model.
The PSID is a longitudinal study of a representative sample of the U.S. population. The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from a nationally representative
sample of 2,930 families designed by the Survey Research Center at the University of
Michigan (the “SRC sample”) and from an over-sample of 1,872 low-income families
from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (the “SEO sample”). Individuals and their
descendants from both samples have been followed over time.
We study the two cohorts born in 1936-45 (the 1940s cohort) and in 1956-1965
(the 1960s cohort) and are not in the SEO sample.21 More specifically, we select
all individuals in the SRC sample who are interviewed at least twice in the sample
years 1968-2013, select heads and their spouses, if present, and keep individuals born
between 1936 and 1965 who did not graduate from college. We also include only white
individuals and drop those who are married to a non-white spouse.22 As reported in
Table 1 in the main text of the paper, the resulting sample includes 5,039 individuals
age 20 to 70, for a total of 73,944 observations.
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal data set collecting information on people age 50 or older, including a wide range of demographic, economic,
and social characteristics, as well as physical and mental health, and cognitive functioning. We use is to compute inputs for the retirement period, because it contains a
large number of observations and high-quality data for this stage of the life cycle.
Our data set is based on the RAND HRS files and the EXIT files, which include
information on the wave right after death. As that data quality from the first two
waves is lower, we use data from wave 3 to wave 12 (that is, from year 1996 to 2014).
We select individuals in the age range 50-100 and thus born between 1906 and 1964.
After keeping white, non-college graduates and their spouses, we are left with 19,377
individuals and 110,923 observations, as detailed in Table 3 in the main text of the
21

The SEO sample includes families with income below half of the poverty line in 1968 and only
29% of them are white individuals or couples with less than a college degree. In addition, in 1997,
the PSID stopped following most SEO families, that are thus no longer in the data set.
22
Wife race is not available in the PSID until 1985. When possible, we use information gathered
after that date. If still missing, we assume wife race is the same as the husband.

Appendix B. First-step estimation
This Appendix details our computations of our first-step model inputs, which
are comprised of human capital, wages, health status at retirement, health dynamics
after retirement, out-of-pocket medical expenses, survival probabilities, marriage and
divorce probabilities, the distribution of people over state variables upon entering the
model and of prospective spouses, the number of children, wealth, Social Security
benefits, and taxes.

Human capital
In the model, we keep track of human capital measured as average accumulated
earnings for a person (ȳkt ), subject to the Social Security cap that is applied to yearly
earnings and is time varying. To compute human capital, we assume that in the PSID
data people start working at age 22 and we use the observed individual-level capped
average earnings that they report starting from that age to compute our measure of
human capital.23

Wages
Our framework requires that we estimate not only wage as a function of human
capital, age, and gender, and the stochastic process for the wage shocks, but also the
realized wage shocks for all men and women of working age in our sample (whether
they are working or not). This is because we allow our initial conditions and assortative matching in marriage to depend on the realized values of these shocks.24
23

For people entering the sample after age 22, we impute average accumulated earnings at the
age of entry in the sample. For this purpose, we run a regression of capped earnings on cohort
dummies, a polynomial in age fully interacted with gender, education dummies, and marital status
and race dummies also interacted with gender. We then compute average capped earnings based on
the predictions from the regression, and assign it to late entrants. Average earnings after entry in
our sample is then updated for each individual following his/her observed earnings history (as done
in the model).
24
French (2005) and Blundell et al. (2016), instead, do not need the actual values of the realized
wage shocks and estimate the parameters of their wage equations by using their structural models
and matching moments on participants, thus relying on the model to generate the same selection
patterns that are in the observed data.

53

To do so, we proceed as follows. First, we impute potential wages for individuals
who are not working, so that we are able to construct potential wage as actual wage
for participants and potential wage for non-participants. Second, we estimate potential wage as a function of age, gender, and human capital. Third, we estimate the
persistence and variance of its unobserved component and the realized wage shocks
using Kalman filtering, as in Borella, De Nardi, and Yang (2017).
Missing wages imputation. The observed wage rate is computed as annual
earnings divided by annual hours worked. Gross annual earnings are defined as labor
income during the previous year. Annual hours are given by annual hours spent
working for pay during the previous year.
We impute missing wages by using coefficients from fixed effects regressions that
we run separately for men and women. To avoid endpoint problems with the polynomials in age, we include individuals age 22 to 70 in the sample. Define the observed
wage for labor market participants as
n ^
ln wagekt = Ikt
ln wagekt .
n
is an indicator for particwhere k denotes an individual and t is age. The term Ikt
ipation (which is equal to 1 if the individual participates in the labor market and
has no missing hours or earnings) and ln^
wage is the potential wage that we wish to
estimate. We estimate
0
ln wagekt = Zkt
βz + fk + ςkt ,

where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the observed hourly wage rate,
fk is an individual-specific fixed effect and ςkt is an error term. We include a rich
set of explanatory variables in Zkt : a fifth-order polynomial in age, a third-order
polynomial in experience (measured in years of labor market participation), marital
status (a dummy for being single), family size (dummies for each value), number of
children (dummies for each value), age of youngest child, and an indicator of partner
working if married. As an indicator of health, we use a variable recording whether
bad health limits the capacity of working (this is the only health indicator available
in the PSID for all years). Because this health indicator is not collected for wives, we
do not include it in the regression for married women. Both regressions also include
interaction terms between the explanatory variables. Variables that do not vary over
time are captured by the individual effect fk .
54

Using the estimated coefficients, we take the predicted value of the wage to be the
potential wage for observations with missing wages. Hence, we define potential wage
as

Wage function estimation. We model wages as a function of human capital,
age, and gender, and we measure human capital as average realized earnings accrued
up to the beginning of age t (ȳt ).
To estimate the wage profiles, we proceed in two stages. First, we run the following
fixed-effect regression for the logarithm of potential wages
ln wagekt = dk + f i (t) +

G
X

βg Dg ln(ȳkt + δy ) + ukt ,

(36)

g=1

on a gender-specific fifth-order polynomial in age f i (t), gender-cohort cells g, and
gender-cohort dummies Dg .25 The shifter δy is set equal to $5,000 to avoid taking
the logarithm of values that are too small.26 We also experimented by adding marital
status dummies to capture the effect of changing marital status on wages, but they did
not turn out to be statistically different from zero, conditional on average earnings.
Second, we regress the sum of the fixed effects and the residuals for each person on
cohort and marital status dummies and their interactions, separately for each gender,
and use those estimated effects for gender, marital status, and cohort as a shifter for
the profiles of each group. This procedure allows for differences in average wages by
marital status and cohort.
Table 14 reports the coefficients of the estimated equation from the first stage,
the fixed effect regression, and Table 15 reports those the second stage, that is the
regression on the residuals and fixed effects from the first stage. The marginal effects
are in Table 7 in the main text of the paper.
The shock in log wage is modeled as the sum of a persistent component plus white
25

To estimate a cohort-specific effect of human capital on wages in Equation (36), we redefine how
we construct our cohorts. More specifically, we take two broader windows to define our cohorts: the
1950 cohort includes the generations born in 1935-1950, while the 1960s cohort includes those born
in 1951-1965. We do so because we do not observe the complete age profile for the wages of the
1960s cohort.
26
While we use earnings subject to the Social Security cap to compute average earnings (this is
the state variable in our model), estimating this wage regression by using uncapped previous average
earnings yields in very similar estimates.

ln kt+1 = ρ ln kt + vkt+1 ,

(38)

where ξkt+1 and vkt+1 are independent white-noise processes with zero mean and
variances equal to σξ2 and σv2 , respectively.
We use the residuals from the first stage to estimate these process separately for
each gender.27
Because initial conditions and assortative matching in marriage are functions of
one’s wage shocks, we need the value of those wage shocks for each person of working
age over time. To do so, we estimate the system formed by (37) and (38) by Maximum
Likelihood, which can be constructed assuming that the initial state of the system
and the shocks are Gaussian, and using standard Kalman Filter recursions. With
this procedure, we are able to estimate both the parameters in (37) and (38) and
the entire state, that is ln kt , t = 1, ...T . Table 16 reports our estimates of the AR
27
For this, we limit the age range between 25 and 65 and, because we rely on residuals also taken
from imputed wages, we drop the highest 0.5% residuals both for men and women. This avoids
large outliers to inflate the estimated variances (however, the effect of this drop is negligible on our
estimates).

Alternative estimation methods in the presence of sample selection.
Our results are thus obtained by running fixed-effect regressions to impute missing
wages, constructing potential wages by using observed wages when available and
imputing wages when missing, and running fixed effects regressions on potential wages
to estimate the deterministic and stochastic components of our wage processes.
In this section, we compare the results from our procedure with those resulting
from two other approaches commonly used in the literature: running fixed effects
on wages for labor market participants and running fixed effects on wages for labor
market participants and applying a control function approach to correct for sample
selection (Dustmann and Rochina-Barrachina, 2007).
The control function approach corrects for sample selection by modeling labor
market participation as a Probit, computing the Mills ratio (which is the probability
that a person is working given his or her characteristics), and then using the inverse
57

Mills ratio as an additional regressor to the main fixed effect (or demeaned) regression for wages. This approach was pioneered by Heckman (1979) and extended by
Wooldridge (1995) to panel data.
To apply the control function approach, we include the following variables to
explain the participation decision: home ownership (dummy), age of the youngest
child, total number of children, number of children age 0-5, and completed grades
of education, all interacted with gender, cohort, and marital status. In addition, we
include an age polynomial interacted with gender.
In the wage equation, we also interact the inverse of the Mills ratio with gender.
As Table 17 shows, the inverse Mills ratio is not significantly different from zero for
men or women, indicating no selection bias is present in the fixed effects estimates.28
The table also shows that all of our estimated coefficients are very similar when using
these three approaches, and thus robust to the specific approach used.

Health status at retirement
We use the HRS data and define health status, ψ, on the basis of self-reported
health a variable that can take five possible values (excellent, very good, good, fair,
poor). Bad health status is defined as a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if self-reported
health is fair or poor and 0 otherwise.29
We cannot calculate the probability of being in bad health at the start of retirement using the observed frequencies for the 1960s cohort because we do not observe
that cohort at that age. We thus resort to the following imputation procedure for
health status at age 66. We estimate a logistic regression or people age 50-68 in
which the dependent variable is health status (0 for good health, 1 for fair or bad
health), on a third-order polynomial in age and cohort dummies, separately for single
men, single women, and couples. In the case of couples we estimate a multinomial
logistic regression over the four possible health states in the couple, respectively for
the husband and the wife: (good, good), (good, bad), (bad, good), and (bad, bad)
28

Because we model wages as a function of human capital and human capital is predetermined
but not strictly exogenous, it should be instrumented, as suggested by Semykina and Wooldridge
(2005), among others. Unfortunately it is not easy to find good instruments for human capital, in
addition to those used to predict participation. We do not attempt to do so, as it is a task that goes
beyond the scope of this Appendix. See Costa Dias et al. (2018) for more on this.
29
Blundell, Britton, Costa Diaz and French (2017) study labor supply behavior around retirement
time and show that self-reported health captures the effects of health well compared with a variety
of health measures, including measures computed using objective health outcomes.

and we use a second-order polynomial in age because higher powers of age are not
statistically different from zero for them. We then use our estimated coefficients to
predict the health status at age 66 for our 1960s cohort.
Table 18 shows our estimated coefficients, while Table 19 reports our predicted
probabilities of being in bad health at age 66 by demographic status, as well as the
p-value of the test of equal probabilities by cohort.
Table 19 shows that single men born in 1960s are almost 8 percentage points more
likely to be in bad health by the time they reach age 66 than those born in the 1940s:

this difference is statistically different from zero at the 1 percent level, as illustrated
by the P-value in the last row of the table. For single women the increase in the
probability of being in bad health at age 66 is also substantial, almost 4.5 percentage
points, and also statistically different from zero. Turning to couples, the probability
that both are partners good health drops by 6.0 percentage points relatively to the
cohort born in 1940s and the probability that partners are in bad health increases
by 4.2 percentage points. The probability of women being in bad health and having
husbands in good health increases by 3.4 percentage points with respect to the cohort
born in 1940s, while the probability that husbands are in bad health and have a
healthy wife decreases slightly, although the change is not statistically significant.

Health dynamics after retirement
We model the evolution of health for people born between 1900 and 1965 as a
logit function:
exp(Xtψ0 β ψ )
ψ
πψt = P rob(ψt = 1 | Xt ) =
1 + exp(Xtψ0 β ψ )
which we then use to construct the transition matrix at each age, gender, and marital
status. The set of explanatory variables Xtψ includes cohort dummies, a second-order
polynomial in age, previous health status, gender, marital status, and interactions
between these variables when they are statistically different from zero. We use estimated coefficients relative to the cohort of interest as input in our model. As the
HRS data are collected every two years, we obtain two-year probabilities and convert
them into one-year probabilities. Table 20 reports our estimated coefficients.

Out-of-pocket medical expenses
Out-of-pocket (oop) medical expenses are defined as the total amount that the
individual spends out of pocket in hospital and nursing home stays, doctor visits,
dental costs, outpatient surgery, average monthly prescription drug costs, home health
care, and special facilities charges. They also include medical expenses in the last year
of life, as recorded in the exit interviews. In contrast, expenses covered by public or
61

private insurance are not included in our measure, as they are not directly incurred
by the individual. The estimated equation is:
m0 m
β + αkm + um
ln(mkt ) = Xkt
kt

where explanatory variables include a third-order polynomial in age fully interacted
with gender and current health status, and we include these interactions whenever
they are statistically different from zero. Marital status (also interacted with other
variables) does not turn out to be significantly different from zero in the first step.
We estimate the equation on the HRS data using a fixed effects estimator, which
takes into account all unmeasured fixed-over-time characteristics that may bias the
age profile, such as differential mortality (as discussed in De Nardi, French and Jones
(2010)). We then regress the residuals from this equation on cohort, gender and
marital status dummies to compute the average effect for each group of interest.
Hence, the profile of the logarithm of medical expenses is constant across cohorts up
to a constant. Table 21 reports estimated coefficients, while Table 8, in the main
text, reports and discusses marginal effects.

Finally, we model the variance of the shocks regressing the squared residuals from
the regression in logs on a third-order polynomial in age fully interacted with gender
and current health status, and on cohort, gender and marital status dummies, and
use it to construct average medical expenses as a function of age by adding half the
variance to the average in logs before exponentiating.

Survival probabilities
We model the probability of being alive at time t as a Logit function
st = P rob(Alivet = 1 | Xts ) =

exp(Xts0 β s )
.
1 + exp(Xts0 β s )

that we estimate using the HRS data (which are biennial). Among the explanatory
variables, we include a third-order polynomial in age, gender, marital status, and
health status in the previous wave, as well as interactions between these variables
and age, whenever they are statistically different from zero. We also include cohort
dummies and use coefficients relative to the cohort of interest to adjust the constant
accordingly. Table 22 reports estimated coefficients.

period. HRS data. Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered at the
individual level. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01

Table 23 reports the marginal effects from our estimated equation. On average
a marginal increase in age reduces the biennial probability of survival by 0.75 and
0.53 percentage points for men and women, respectively, with the effect getting larger
with age: at age 96, a marginal increase in age decreases the survival probability by
63

4.54 and 4.27 percentage points for men and women. The effect of age also differs
according to one’s health status: a marginal increase in age reduces the biennial
probability of survival by 0.61 percentage points if a man is in good health, and by
1.05 percentage points if he is in bad health. For women, the negative effect of age
almost doubles if they are in bad health, going 0.41 to 0.77 percentage points. While
being married increases the probability of survival, being born in 1960s (relative to
being born in 1940s) decreases it, although the cohort effect, when conditioning on the
health status, is not precisely estimated and statistically different from zero (although
it would be very significant if we did not include health in the regression).

We transform the biennial probability of surviving that we estimate from the HRS
data into an annual probability by taking the square root of the biennial probability.

Marriage and divorce probabilities
We use the PSID to estimate the probabilities of marriage and divorce.30 We
model the probability of getting married, νt+1 and separately estimate the probability
30
Because the number of new marriages (and also of divorces) is limited in the data, we constrain
the cohort effect of the 1960s cohort to be the same as the one for the 1950 cohort.

Conditional on meeting a partner, the probability of meeting with a partner p
with wage shock pt+1 is
ξt+1 (·) = ξt+1 (pt+1 |it+1 , i).
where i denotes gender. We compute the above probability using our estimates of
the wage shocks, by partitioning households in age groups (25-35; 35-45; 45-60) and
computing the variance-covariance matrix of newly matched partners’ wage shocks
in each age group. The implied correlation in the three age groups is 0.24, 0.33, and
31

The PSID goes from a yearly to a biennial frequency in 1997. To take this into account, we
include an indicator variable taking value one from 1997 on in the regression, which we then abstract
from when constructing the yearly probabilities.

0.36 respectively. We then assume that the joint distribution is lognormal. As in the
whole sample we observe 722 new marriages in the age range 25-60, we do not allow
this probability to depend on cohort.
We assume random matching over asset and lifetime income of the partner conditional on partner’s wage shock. Thus, we compute
p
θt+1 (·) = θt+1 (apt+1 , ȳt+1
|pt+1 ).

using sample values of assets, average capped earnings, and wage shocks. More specifically, we assume θt+1 is log-normally distributed at each age with mean and variance
computed from sample values. Assets include a shifter as described for the computation of joint the distribution at age 25 (see Wealth subsection in this Appendix).

Distributions upon entering the model and for prospective
spouses
For single men and women, we parameterize the joint distribution of assets, average realized earnings, and wage shocks at each age as a joint log normal distribution
given by


 i

ln(ait + δa )
µat + δa



i 
(39)
 ln(ȳti + δy )  ∼ N  µiȳt + δy , Σst  ,
i
i
ln t
µt
where Σs is a 3x3 covariance matrix and i denotes gender. We characterize this
distribution by estimating its mean and its variance, which both depend on age t.
To estimate means, we regress the logarithm of assets plus shift parameter, average
earnings, and the productivity shock ln ˆit on a third-order polynomial in age and
cohort dummies. The predicted age profile, is the age-specific estimate of the mean
of the log-normal distribution. We estimate the elements of the variance-covariance
matrix by taking the relevant squares or cross-products of the residuals from this
regression. To obtain a a smoothed estimate of the variance-covariance matrix at
each age, we regress them on a third-order polynomial in age, element by element.
For couples, we compute the initial joint distribution at age 25 of the following

where Σc is a 5x5 covariance matrix computed on the data for couples.

Number of children
We regress the number of children on a fifth-order polynomial in maternal age,
interacted with marital status and cohort dummies to construct the average age profile
of children in each age group for single and married women and use the profiles relative
to the cohorts of mothers born in 1960s. We runs such a regression for total number
of children (used in equivalence scales), children 0-5, and children 6-11 (these two
affect child care costs).

Wealth
We define wealth as total assets (defined as all assets types available in the PSID)
plus home equity net. Wealth in the PSID is only recorded in 1984, 1989, 1994, and
then in each (biennial) wave from 1999 onwards. We rely on an imputation procedure
to compute wealth in the missing years, starting in 1968. This imputation is based
on the following fixed-effect regression
0
ln(akt + δa ) = Zkt
βz + dak + wakt ,

(41)

where k denotes the individual and t is age. The parameter δa is a shifter for assets
to have only positive values and to be able to take logs, and the variables Z include
polynomials in age, also interacted with health status, and with average earnings
(uncapped), family size, and a dummy for health status. The term dak is the individual fixed effect and wakt is a white-noise error term. Equation (41) is estimated
separately for single men, single women, and couples, as wealth is measured at the
household level.
We then use the imputed as well as the actual observations to estimate the wealth
67

profiles used as target moments and to parameterize the joint distribution of initial
assets, average realized earnings, and wage shocks for single men, single women, and
couples.

Social Security benefits
The Social Security benefit at age 66 is calculated to mimic the Old Age and
Survivor Insurance component of the Social Security system:

The marginal rates and bend points, expressed as fractions of average household
income, come from the Social Security Administration.32
The Social Security tax and Social Security cap have been changing over time.
We also allow them to change over time for the households in our model.

Taxes
Guner et al. (2012b) estimate the tax function by marital status. We use their
estimated parameters for married and singles unconditional of number of children.
The resulting values for a married couple are p2 = 1.8500; b2 = 0.2471; s2 = 0.0006.
Those for singles are: p1 = 1.4150; b1 = 0.2346; s1 = 0.0074. We also add a 4% state
and local tax.

Appendix C. Robustness to sample selection
Table 25 uses the PSID data to show that the fraction of the population having
less than a college degree dropped from 83.1% in 1940s to 77.2% in 1960s. This corresponds to a 6 percentage points drop in non-college graduates in the population across
our two cohorts (5.6 and 6.6 percentage points for men and women respectively).

Table 25: Cumulative distributions of grade of school completed for the sample of white
people in our main cohorts, by gender and cohort. PSID data.

To check whether sample selection is an important issue for us, we compare our
main model inputs for our original sample, the “education selection sample” with that
in a second sample “education selection with constant fraction size.” To construct this
second sample, we first take white people without a college degree born in the 1940s
cohort and in the 1960s cohort in both data sets. Then, we increase the size of
the 1960s cohort by picking, among those who have completed college in the 1960s
cohort, those that had the lowest initial human capital at age 25 (both among men
and women). Thus, in this second sample we have the same fraction of men and
women for both the 1960s and 1940s cohorts.
The following table and graphs compare life expectancy, wages, and medical expenses for our 1940s cohort (unchanged) and 1960s cohorts with the two selection
criteria. They show that the results are very similar across the two samples.
