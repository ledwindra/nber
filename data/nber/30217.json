    "abstract": "\n\nMuch of the extant literature predicts market returns with \u201csimple\u201d models that use only a few parameters. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we theoretically prove that simple models severely understate return predictability compared to \u201ccomplex\u201d models in which the number of parameters exceeds the number of observations. We empirically document the virtue of complexity in US equity market return prediction. Our findings establish the rationale for modeling expected returns through machine learning.\n\n",
