Securing Their Future? Entry And Survival In The Information Security Industry

JEL No. L24,L25,L26
ABSTRACT
In this paper we study how the existence of a functioning market for technology differentially conditions
the entry strategy and survival of different types of entrants, and the role of scale, marketing ability
and technical assets. Markets for technology facilitate entry of firms that lack proprietary technology
and increase vertical specialization. However, they also increase the relative advantage of downstream
capabilities, which is reflected in the relatively improved performance of incumbent Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) firms compared to startups. We find that diversifying entrants
perform better relative to startups. Contrary to earlier studies, we find that spin-offs do not perform
any better than other startups. Moreover, firms founded by serious hobbyists and tinkerers, whom
we call hackers, perform markedly better than other startups. These findings reflect the non-manufacturing
setting of this study, as well as the distinctive nature of software technology.

1. Introduction:
Studies of industry evolution conclude that established firms tend to outperform startups
(Dunne et al., 1988; Mitchell, 1991; Klepper and Simons, 2000a; Klepper, 2002). A variety of
possible sources of advantage have been identified. Established firms are larger, endowed with
complementary assets like distribution and marketing networks, better management capabilities,
and even perhaps superior technology. The relative importance of these factors in the advantage
that established firms enjoy over startups remains unclear. The literature also concludes that the
pre-entry experience of entrants is very important, so that spinoffs from existing firms or startups
from related industries outperform others. Once again, the precise nature of the relevant prior
experience is less clear (Chatterji, 2006).
Existing literature implicitly focuses on firms that rely upon internally generated
technologies. We explicitly consider how markets for technology condition the entry strategy
and the subsequent performance of entrepreneurs, and changes the relative value of different
types of firm competencies.1 At the very least, the existence of technology suppliers expands the
strategy space of the entrepreneur. As Gambardella and Giarratana (2006) point out, technology
holders may choose to license technology to others. Other entrants, especially incumbent ICT
firms diversifying into the Information Security Market (ISM) may find it more profitable to
acquire external technology than to develop the technology by themselves. (Arora, Fosfuri and
Gambardella, 2001, Gans, Hsu and Stern ,2002).
In addition, markets for technology may also condition the subsequent fate of entrants.
Lowered entry barriers may mean more competition and greater likelihood of exit. More
interestingly, the relative performance of different types of entrants may also be affected,

between licensing technology rather than offering products for sale.

changing the relative importance of production and marketing ability compared to technical
ability.
To answer these questions we develop a novel dataset of entrants in the ISM. Before the
internet, computer attacks, with the exception of viruses, were largely restricted to large
computer networks typically owned by the government. The large scale adoption of the internet
in the mid 1990’s meant that a growing amount of commercially valuable data had to be
protected against attackers, accidental loss, and prying eyes. The growth of digital products
(including songs and videos) required means of controlling the access and use of those products.
Further, online commerce required authenticating participants, secure communications and
controlling access. More recently, users have to be protected against spam and “phishing”
attacks, which induce unwary users to part with confidential information. Thus, the ISM consists
of several submarkets that emerged at different points in time.
Given the general-purpose nature of information technology, entrants into the ISM are
diverse: software, hardware or telecommunication equipment producers, startups with founders
from these same IT industries, as well as from industries such as defense and financial services
have all entered the ISM. However, what perhaps distinguishes the ISM is the rarity of spinoffs
and perhaps also the number of pioneering startups founded by very skilled hobbyists or
tinkerers, whom we shall call “hackers”.2
This paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a brief background on information
security technologies. Section 3 reviews literature and provides a theory that guides our
empirical analysis in section 5. Section 4 provides a description of the data. In section 6 we
conclude with a summary of our key findings of this work.

Hackers lack advanced degrees in computer sciences, nor do they hold important positions in established ICT firms
at the time of founding. Yet, in ISM, they are among the pioneers and, more interestingly, the source of many of the
current market leaders.

2. Information security market:
Four major types of technologies are involved in securing information and computer
networks: (i) Encryption, to disguise data and preserve confidentiality of transactions (ii) Packet
inspection and filtering, based on pattern matching (for firewalls, anti-virus and intrusion
detection) (iii) Image matching, to identify end users to systems based on their physical attributes
such as fingerprints, retina and (iv) “Single sign on” technology to enable users to be
authenticated to multiple systems just using own common password.
(i) Encryption: Encryption relies heavily upon the science of cryptography. Before the internet,
encryption was used to protect communication, such as communication between ATM terminals
and central banking servers. Innovation in computer networking accentuated the need for more
sophisticated methods of encryption on a public computer network, resulting in the invention of
public key encryption in 1976.3 Encryption uses encryption keys generated by multiplying two
large random prime numbers. Decryption, on the other hand, involves factoring this large
number to figure to discover the prime number that was originally used to encrypt the data.
Public key cryptography was first applied for encrypting email.
Internet and e-commerce, and the increased sophistication of attacks, increased the need
for encryption technology. This in turn, meant larger keys had to be used to encrypt data which,
required greater processing power. Also, the need for encryption solutions on small devices such
as smart cards, cell phones and PDAs (where limited amount of data, including encryption
strings, can be stored) required more efficient methods of encryption. Certicom, another
important player in the encryption market, successfully invented a more efficient algorithm for
public key cryptography called elliptic curve cryptography in 1997. At present RSA and

3

In 1976, a public key technology called the Diffie-Hellman algorithm was invented at Stanford in 1976. RSA,
another key algorithm for public key cryptography was invented at MIT in 1977.

4

elliptical curve algorithms invented by Certicom are the two most widely used encryption
methods to protect data.
(ii) Pattern Matching and filtering: Pattern matching technology builds on routing technologies
that direct internet communications. These products scan network traffic and make decisions
based on parameters such as the source and destination of internet traffic. The advent of the
internet required more sophisticated filtering and checks.

The most important filtering

technology is the stateful inspection technology, which, is a method to keep track of previous
communication between two networked computers. This technology was invented by,
Checkpoint Technologies, a startup established in Israel, in 1996.
(iii) Image matching: Image matching or biometric technologies are used to verify or recognize
the identity of a person based on a physical characteristic like fingerprints or retina patterns.
There are three basic methods (1) a mechanism to scan and capture an image; (2) compression,
processing and comparison of the image to a database of stored images; and (3) interface with
applications systems4. Large hardware producers like Hughes, IBM, Burroughs and Harris
Corporation, and defense contractors were among the early participants in this technology, as
biometric technologies were used principally by government agencies and financial firms prior to
1997. With increased use of mobile computing, the demand for biometric technologies has
grown rapidly.
(iv) Single sign on: Single sign on technologies are algorithms that enable users to use one
password and log on to multiple computer systems. For example, Kerberos invented at MIT, is
widely used in universities to authenticate students and staff to multiple systems with just one

password. Since one of the selling points of e-commerce was the ability to conduct transactions
between two unknown parties, verifying identify instantaneously became another critical
function of this technology.
(v) Services: In addition consulting firms advise enterprises about compliance with regulatory
mandates, including HIPPA, Sarbanes Oxley, Basle II, Gramm-Leachman-Bailey, and various
DoD mandates, such as Phipps and Common Criterion.
ISM products typically combine one or more of ISM technologies (see table 1 below)5 as
a product to cater to the needs of users. For instance, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) product
uses encryption to enable organizations and desktop users to securely communicate using the
internet. Authentication products use encryption (sometimes combined with pattern or image
matching) to regulate user access to the network.
Entrants into the ISM can either be in the product market (also called “downstream”), in
the licensing market (“upstream”), or both (also called “both”). In our data, there are few
upstream entrants, all of them licensing encryption technology. RSA and Certicom are two of the
most successful firms that license encryption technology mainly to network security and
authentication product vendors. 6 Other technologies such as image matching, pattern matching
and single sign on are sold by vendors that also sell products incorporating the technology. For
instance, Symantec not only sells an antivirus product, but they also license pattern-matching
technology. Similarly, Checkpoint not only manufactures and sells firewall known as Firewall-1,
but it also licenses pattern matching technology to other firewall producers.
5

In our empirical analysis, we shall frequently group downstream segments into two - those based on encryption
technologies, and those based on other technologies. However, the results are not affected by treating firewalls,
antivirus, spam, hardware and consulting as distinct from each other and from network security, authentication and
encryption products. Neither are our results affecting by treating only network security and encryption products as
encryption based and leaving out authentication (which also relies upon single sign-on technology, and perhaps also
image matching.)

RSA after its merger with Security Dynamics in the late 1990’s entered product markets.

3. Previous literature and Theory
Our work draws from two streams of literature: strategy literature and entrepreneurship
literature.
Evolutionary economists conjecture that the historical antecedents of entrepreneurs,
especially pre-entry experiences not only condition entry strategies, but also subsequent
performance. These capabilities include technology, production expertise and facilities, brand
name and reputation, human assets, established marketing channels, that are typically rare,
valuable, imperfectly mobile (Barney, 1991; Markides and Williamson, 1996) and typically must
be accumulated internally (Dierickx and Kool, 1989). In fact, many empirical researchers take
the view that one reason that firm size is positively correlated with survival is because firm size
captures the effects of learning and accumulation of relevant competitive assets post entry
(Geroski, 1995), a fact that is also true of small firms (See Audretsch and Mahmood, 1995 or
Dunne et al 1989 for example).
Diversifying entrants tend to enter industries whose resource requirements are similar to
their own. For instance, in the television industry, many of the early entrants were radio
producers (Klepper and Simons, 2000a). Similarly in the automobile industry, entrepreneurs
with experience in manufacturing carriages and bicycles not only entered early relative to other
entrants but also survived longer (Klepper, 2002). Many studies of large manufacturing firms

7

conclude that a greater fit between the resource requirements of the new industry and that of the
potential entrant increases the likelihood of entry (Chatterjee and Wernerfelt, 1991; Chang, 1997;
Merino and Rodriguez, 1997; Silverman, 1999). The fit could be based on technology or
marketing. For instance, in the television industry, 14 out the 16 top radio producers in 1940
diversified into the television industry (Klepper and Simmons, 2000). Similarly, in the
automobile industry about 47% of the entrants diversified from related industries that included
bicycle, carriage or engine manufacturing (Carroll et al, 1996).
Although diversifiers are the most important type of entrant, startups, including firms
spun out of existing producers (spinoffs), typically constitute the majority of entrants (Dunne,
Roberts, and Samuelson, 1988). Spinoffs may occur due to disagreements between the manager
and employee (Klepper and Thompson, 2005) typically about how best to exploit new idea.
Spinoffs could also occur when property rights are non-existent or weak or when the employee
owns the rights to an invention (Anton and Yao, 1995). When the external environment is
conducive to startups parent firms might actively encourage exploration of new ideas and exploit
it in house (Hellmann, 2006). Unlike other industries studied by scholars, there are far fewer
spinoffs in ISM compared to other industry settings, perhaps reflecting the relative youth of ISM.
Lead users, with extensive knowledge of consumer preferences, were also sources of
entry into even manufacturing centric industries such as typesetting (Tripsas, 2001). Many
industries also witness entry by entrepreneurs with very specific technical knowledge. In the
medical devices industry, for instance, clinical doctors often identify opportunities that lead to
new types of devices (Chatterji, 2006).
Pre-entry experience may also be critical for subsequent performance (Helfat and
Lieberman, 2002). For instance, Thompson (2002), using data on the ship building industry,

8

found that pre-entry experience of entrants has a strong and long- lasting positive effect on firm
survival that went beyond scale economies and learning subsequent to entry. Klepper (2002) and
Carroll et al, (1996) found similar patterns for automobiles, Mitchell (1989) for medical imaging,
and Klepper and Simons, (2000a) for televisions.
However there is less consensus on which types of pre-experience is more valuable,
perhaps because the nature of industry dictates which experiences are more valuable than others.
For instance, in televisions, the ability to conduct R&D was a distinct source of advantage to the
radio manufactures that not only enabled them to enter early but also survive longer (Klepper
and Simons, 2000a). In the medical imaging industry, the advantage to diversifying entrants was
due to their superiority in sales and distribution (Mitchell, 1989).
Similarly, while prior research has shown that pre-entry experiences of founders
influence subsequent performance of startups, the type of experience that conditions subsequent
performance varies with the industry that is investigated. Startups from related parents were
more likely to succeed in automobiles (Klepper, 2002) and shipbuilding industries (Thompson,
2002) by virtue of their experience in fabrication. In lasers, spinoffs succeeded based on their
technical expertise gained while working for the parent (Klepper and Sleeper, 2005). In other
industries, spinoff success was based on non-technical learning, such as knowledge of FDA
approval process in medical devices (Chatterji, 2006). In our empirical analysis we compare the
subsequent performances of different types of entrants and also the sources of such performance
advantages.
Prior work by strategy scholars indicates that not only do markets for technology exist
within ISM, but more importantly they also condition firm strategy (Arora, Fosfuri and
Gambardella, 2001; Gans, Hsu and Stern, 2002). Encryption technologies are patent intensive

9

relative to other ISM technologies and are extensively licensed (Giarratana, 2004). Gambardella
and Giarratana (2007) analyze how markets for technology affect the choice between licensing
or developing a product.
We explore how the presence of markets for technology influences entry strategy and
subsequent performance of firms in the ISM. Also we explore which competencies are relatively
more important than others both in the presence and absence of markets for technology.
Theory
We motivate our empirical analysis with a stylized model to derive predictions to guide
our empirical analysis. We make several simplifying assumptions, particularly about inter-firm
heterogeneity and the sources of pre-entry uncertainty to develop a tractable model where both
the product market and the market for technology are in equilibrium. An important simplification
is that we do not analyze industry dynamics. Rather, all firms enter at the same time. At the time
of entry, firms are uncertain of their profitability in the product market. Following entry, this
uncertainty is resolved and some firms exit. The market clearing prices in the product and
technology markets reflect this entry and exit.
Notation and assumptions:
We assume that firms entering the product market require technology and the ability to
produce and market the product(s). A proportion of the potential entrants, λ, are endowed with a
technology, while others have to acquire it from a technology supplier. Firms endowed with
technology decide whether to enter only the product market (downstream), only the technology
market (upstream) or both (“both” segment).
Firms differ in how efficiently they can produce and sell an ISM product. In general,
efficiency is multifaceted. However, we assume that more efficient firms produce and sell a

10

higher quantity denoted by q. Thus q is a summary measure of the differences in efficiency (as
well as scale), and is distributed in the population with distribution function F(q). The cost
function for firms in the product market is cq + θ, where c is the marginal cost and θ is a fixed
cost. 7 The actual fixed cost of each firm is θ + ε, where ε is a mean zero iid random variable. At
the time of entry, firms do not observe ε, and thus are uncertain about their true profitability in
the product market. However after entry, this uncertainty is resolved. This is a simple modeling
device to produce exit from the product market, and is a variant of the approach used in
Jovanovic (1982). Ignoring product heterogeneity, we assume that the demand for the product
D(p), is decreasing in p, the product price.
Modeling the technology market is more challenging. We adopt a reduced form
approach. Each licensor earns license revenues of L. Licensees buy technology at a price of τ.
We do not model how τ is determined. Instead, τ is simply assumed to be a decreasing function
of the total number of licensors, M. We further assume that there are diseconomies of scope
when firms enter “both” segment, denoted by γ per unit of output produced and sold by the firm.
This cost denotes the rent dissipation effect due to erosion of profits due to another firm
(licensees) competing in the product market (Arora and Fosfuri, 2003). All licensors incur a sunk
entry cost of E. Finally, we assume that there are some technology suppliers that are pure
licensors, whose number, b, is exogenous to the model. These can be thought of representing
inventors and university researchers that have developed technology that they offer for license.
Underlying this reduced form we have in mind a situation where technologies offered for
license are symmetric but each potential buyer has some idiosyncratic preferences, reflecting its
own market niche. Licensors compete for each potential buyer in a Vickery type second price
7

Even for digital products such as information security products, there are incremental costs of reaching and
servicing additional buyers, customizing products for their needs and so on.

11

auction. The winning licensor is paid the incremental value it offers over the next best bidder.
This would lead to the familiar outcome where the market is divided equally among the suppliers
and all suppliers charge the same non-zero price, which decreases with the total number of
suppliers, but does not depend upon the number of buyers.
Profits
Profits in the downstream segment (product market) are given by П D = (p-c)q –θ. The
profits of firms that both supply technology and produce is given by П B = (p-c-γ)q –θ+L-E. The
profits of a firm that only supplies technology is given by П L = L-E.

Exit: Post entry, firms realize an operating cost of θ+ε, where ε denotes iid shocks that is mean
zero, distributed H(.). The probability of exit for firms that enter downstream is given by the

segment have a higher probability of exit given by 1-H[(p-c-γ)q- θ]. Note that we implicitly
assume that firms that are exclusive technology suppliers do not exit the ISM. Our data largely
supports this assumption. Of a total of 17 pure technology suppliers, only 1 exited.8

Market Equilibrium
Market equilibrium involves two interrelated markets: The product market and the
technology market. Equilibrium in product market implies that the quantity supplied by
producers must equal the quantity demanded. The quantity supplied in the product market is the
total quantity supplied by the survivors in the product market. This condition is thus given by

8

The assumption of no exit from the licensing market is made mostly for modeling convenience. We conjecture
that allowing exit from the licensing market will not qualitatively affect our results. It does, however, complicate
exit probabilities for firms in the “both” segment.

In the technology market, market clearing is more subtle. Any given licensor can sell as
many licenses as required. The equilibrium condition is that the total license revenues (of all
technology suppliers), should equal the total licensing payments. The former is LM, and the
latter is equal to the number of licensees multiplied by the license price τ.

To get some intuition into these market clearing conditions, figure 2 shows how M and p
are related for each market clearing condition. The PP curve represents equilibrium in the
product market, and TT curve represents equilibrium in the technology market. While PP curve
is downward sloping, the TT curve is upward sloping (all proofs are contained in the appendix).
The intersection represents market equilibrium, with p* and M* as the equilibrium price and
technology suppliers. Figure 2 shows that an increase in b increases M* and reduces p*.
The model has a number of testable predictions. The formal statements and proofs are all
contained in the appendix. Here we state the results verbally. As shown in figure 1, it predicts
that larger firms will, if they enter, produce rather than license, even if these firms have
proprietary technology. Licensing to others is not attractive because such licensing creates
competition in the product market and dissipates rents. In our empirical analysis, we measure

14

the entrant size. However, we have a number of other measures that plausibly proxy for different
dimensions of efficiency such as the number of trademarks, as well as whether the firm is an
existing firm entering the ISM market.

Result 1: Increases in firm scale increases the proportion of downstream entry. More generally,
increases in firm efficiency increase the proportion of downstream entry.
The model implies that an increase in b increases the probability of entry into the
downstream segment by firms endowed with technology, as well as those that are not. An
increase in b has two effects. It decreases the license price, τ, and reduces p, the product price.
For producers endowed with technology, an increase in b makes licensing less attractive: the
firm indifferent between downstream and both now prefers downstream. For firms without
technology, the net effect is to encourage entry, which by definition is downstream.

Result 2: An increase in competition in the market for technology will increase the probability of
downstream entry.

15

If competition in the market for technology lowers entry barriers into the product market,
this also implies more intense competition in the product market. More intense competition
should hurt the average performance, increasing the likelihood of exit or slowing growth rates.
When more firms enter due to lower entry barriers, prices fall, resulting in higher exits rates on
average. Thus, a reduction of entry barriers increases the probability of exit by increasing the
overall number of firms and lowering prices. In our model, entrants account for this higher
probability of exit in their entry decisions. However, since there is no sunk entry cost, this does
not affect their entry decisions. A modest entry cost will not change the result since ultimately
the higher exit is due to lower prices, which will only happen if there is net entry.
Result 3: Increased competition in market for technology will increase average exit rates.
Since the probability of exit is decreasing in q, firms with higher values of q are less
likely to exit, all else equal. More generally, efficient producers and marketers of products are,
all else constant, less likely to exit the ISM as well.
Result 4: Increases in firm scale reduce exit. More efficient firms have a lower probability of
exit relative to less efficient firms.
The final result concerns how increases in the competition in the market for technology
differentially affect firms with different scales of operation. In our model, there are two
offsetting forces. Firms with larger q are more likely to suffer greater losses from a drop in
price. However, more efficient and larger firms are also more likely to survive cost shocks
relative to less efficient firms. Which of these effects dominates depends upon the distribution of
the cost shocks. We show that under some restrictions, which are, for instance satisfied by the
exponential family (including the normal), the latter effect outweighs the former, so that an
increase in competition in the market for technology increases exit for smaller firms by more,

16

than for larger firms. Although this result is a limited one, we believe it reflects a broader
intuition, namely that as technology becomes cheaper, the sources of differentiation shift towards
other sorts of assets, including production and marketing. In our model, we do not allow for
differential access to technology, or for a competitive advantage to firms with proprietary
technology. We conjecture that in a model with these features such a result would hold a
fortiori.
Result 5: Increased competition in market for technology increases average exit rate by more for
smaller firms than for larger firms.

4. Data:
Our sample consists of 343 security firms, followed from the time of entry until 2004 or
their exit, whichever is earlier. From the Corptech directory, we obtained names of all firms that
entered ISM between 1989 and 2004. This dataset was manually augmented with information on
submarkets of entry using Internet archives (www.archive.org), an internet web site that
maintains historical archives of many web sites.
Firms in our sample exited due to two reasons: non viability of the business (death) or
acquisition by another firm (merger) (identified using Lexis-Nexus mergers and acquisitions
database). These were coded separately in the dataset. We distinguish between successful
acquisitions (based on reported transaction values) and distress acquisitions. As we will explain
later, while comparing performance of firms in the ISM we treat the successful acquisitions as
censored observations and distress acquisitions as death.
In addition, we recorded the sources of entry by tracking information about the founders
(for up to 4 founders) of security firms. Such data was collected from a variety of publicly
available data sources on the internet such as ZoomInfo (www.zoominfo.com), LinkedIn

17

(www.linkedIn.com), Google Archives (www.archives.google.com), Internet Archive
(www.archive.org) and, EDGAR database.
We classified startups into one or more of the following categories based on the
immediate prior experience of founders: spin-offs (firms founded by employees of an ISM firm),
related startups (startups founded by employees of computer hardware, software or
telecommunication firms), unrelated startups (founders from defense, finance, aerospace and
automobile industries), university founders, hackers9 and IT consultants.10 In our empirical
analysis, we frequently club unrelated startups with hackers and universities (referred to as
“other” category henceforth) thereby, focusing the analysis on diversifiers, related startups spinoffs and unrelated startups.
For all sample firms, we also collected the number of security related patents and all IT
trademarks held by the firms at the time of entry into ISM from the U.S.PTO database. Security
related patents are those that belong to the US patent technological classes 705 subclass 50-79,
380 and 726. We then weighted the patents using the number of forward citations to account for
their relative value and importance of patents (Trajtenberg, 1990). For IT trademarks, we did
keyword search on the U.S.PTO trademarks database (http://tess.uspto.gov) to gather the number
of IT related trademarks held by the firm.11 We also collected data on licensing transactions from
the Lexis-Nexus database. We were able to identify if firms entered the ISM by licensing a
technology only in the case of 120 firms. We use data on licensing transactions only in auxiliary
regressions to test the robustness of our main results.

Hackers are defined as those that (a) do not have a CS or EE degree, (b) do not have high level experience in IT
firms and (c) were self-employed prior to founding the firm.
10
IT consultants are those that (a) have a CS or EE degree and (b) were self employed prior to founding the firm.

We used the following search query on the trademark database. Trademark description includes ("computer") OR
("hardware") OR ("pixel") OR ("telecom") OR ("telecommunications") OR ("software") OR ("Wireless") OR
("computing") OR ("database") OR ("data base ") OR ("pixels") OR ("computer program") OR ("Network") OR
("LAN") OR ("Networking") OR (" computer protocol ") OR (" Internet ").

We also identified the submarket of entry for all the firms using internet resources as
stated above. For each entrant we first determined the submarket of entry. We then identified if
entrants were selling only technology in which case they were classified as being technology
suppliers (or “upstream”). Firms that were selling only products were classified as
“downstream” firms, while firms that sold both products and technology were classified as
operating in “both” markets. In the data set there are 17 technology suppliers that entered the
ISM.
We also recorded the size of firms at the time of entry into the ISM. For startups this is
the number of employees at the time of entry into the ISM. For diversifying entrants, we
calculated size at the time of entry as follows: we first identified all the markets in which,
diversifying entrants operated in at the time of entry; we then divided the total employees of the
diversifier by the total number of markets that diversifiers operated in to get the size at the time
of entry for diversifiers.

Sources of firm formation and patterns of entry into ISM:
The ISM has grown considerably over the past 15 years. The industry thusfar has not
experienced a shakeout, as also confirmed by Giarratana (2004). In the 1980s, ISM mainly
comprised of technologies rather than products used by a handful of enterprises and mainly by
the defense industry. Entry (figure 1) shows two peaks – first around 1989 and the second one
around 1995. The first peak was largely an after-effect of “moris” worm that sparked research in
antivirus and network security technology. The advent of the internet increased entry,
particularly by startups.

The ISM also witnessed entry by university based startups particularly in encryption, a
pattern that was true of the laser industry (Sleeper, 1998) as well as of medical devices (Chatterji,
2006). However, the proportion of such entrants was significantly lower (8% in ISM vs. 26% in
laser and 29% in medical devices). Two interesting patterns emerge from comparing the entry
patterns of ISM with that of other industries. First, many ISM firms (about 10%) have been
founded by hackers. (see table 3). Although such entry is virtually non-existent in other
industries, it is not inconsistent with the view that in many industries lead users innovate, either
to customize products or to fix problems in them.12 Hackers personify what von Hippel (2005)
has dubbed the democratization of innovation, perhaps a throwback to the tinkerers and inventors
of the 19th century. Second is the virtual absence of spin-offs in the ISM relative to other

12

to the security module of Apache web server.

21

industries. While in most manufacturing based industries, spin-offs constitute a big percentage of
all startups, only 6% of all entrants were startups.
Overall, despite the pervasive nature of IT and non-manufacturing nature of the industry,
the sources of entry in the ISM are surprisingly similar to other industries with two exceptions:
first, is the possible exception of hackers and second is the virtual absence of spin-offs. Yet, this
exception is consequential. An examination of the top 15 market leaders (as identified by the
InformationSecurity magazine in 2007) in ISM suggests that diversifying entrants as well as
hackers perform better relative to all other entrants, while none of the top performers are spinoffs. Of the top 15 market leaders, 6 or about 40% were hacker founded startups. About a third
are incumbent ICT trademarks diversifying into ISM. Both of the top technology suppliers were
startups that were founded by university professors.

Timing of entry
In many industries such as automobiles (Klepper, 2002) diversifying entrants were
among the first to enter the ISM, while in certain other industries such as disk drives
(Christensen, 1997), startups were among the first to enter. There do not appear to be big
differences in the mean time of entry between startups and diversifiers. There are no significant
differences between the timing of entry between different categories of startups, except that
related startups enter ISM later than both diversifiers and other startups. Relative to diversifiers,
startups were not only smaller at the time of entry but they also entered the industry with fewer
security patents.
Table 5 shows that the internet stimulated the demand for information security, with over
80% (300 firms of a total of 343 firms) of the firms entering after 1995. The proportion of firms
entering downstream segment also increased from just under 50% pre-internet to nearly 66%
post-internet. Most of this increase is due to startups. Whereas pre-internet, only 36% of the
startups were downstream, post-internet, 66% were downstream.
In many manufacturing industries although startups constitute the major number of
entrants, they are less successful (Dunne et al., 1988). This is true of ISM as well (see table 6).
Many previous studies provide insights into the reasons for this superior performance. In some
industries such as televisions, such performance advantages are driven by superior R&D
capability (Klepper and Simons, 2000a). In other industries it is driven by superior
complementary capability, specifically superior sales and distribution capability (medical
imaging - Mitchell, 1989; Disk drives – King and Tucci, 2001). Table 7 shows that diversifying
entrants were not only larger at entry, but that they also had more security patents at entry.

Interestingly in the ISM, diversifying entrants are relatively more successful in the
downstream segment (selling only products) suggesting that perhaps such performance
advantages are due to superior production or marketing and distribution capabilities (see table 7).
Also, the ISM seems be different from lasers in which spinoffs are successful. In the ISM,
spinoffs do not perform as well as diversifying entrants. This is also the case with related
startups as well. We explore this further in our empirical analysis.

Technology and product markets:
As explained earlier, firms in the sample were classified as technology suppliers, product
vendors or both. The technology markets are for encryption, image matching, pattern matching
and single sign on technologies. The product markets consist of firewall, antivirus,
authentication, encryption, hardware, network security, spam control and consulting.
In our empirical analysis, to conserve degrees of freedom, we consolidate product
markets into those that use encryption technologies, and those based on other technologies. The
former consists of encryption products, network security, and authentication, while firewalls,
antivirus, spam control, hardware and consulting make up the other category. Our results are
robust to inclusion of individual market specific fixed effects.
Encryption is by far the most patent intensive ISM technology (Giarratana, 2004).
Roughly two thirds of all security patents related to encryption technology. Encryption markets
are also more licensing intensive. Table 8 shows the number of patents per entrant and the
number of licenses per entrant in ISM. There were almost three times as many licensing
transactions per firm in encryption markets relative to other markets. Finally, for a subset of
entrants, we were able to trace the source of technology. The last column in table 8 shows that
whereas 65% of the entry in encryption was based on licensed technology, the corresponding
figure is only 13% for the other markets.

5. Empirical results:
In order to test hypotheses that relate to how markets for technology condition entry and
exit, we exploit the variation across segments (encryption based and non-encryption based) as
well variation over time, in the number of specialized licensors. Our benchmark specification
uses the number of specialized licensors as a proxy for the extent of competition in the market
for technology, and roughly corresponds to b in the theoretical model.
Strictly speaking the number of specialized licensors is endogenous. In our data,
virtually all of these are the results of university invented technology being licensed by a startup.
University invention may itself be related to characteristics of the underlying technology that are,
in turn, related to conditions of entry and exit. We address this concern by using a type of
“difference-in-difference” strategy to identify the impact of interest. For instance, in a number of
our hypotheses, markets for technology affect different types of entrants differentially. By
stressing these differences (in addition to the main effect), we can be more confident that what
we see is the hypothesized effect, rather than merely unobserved differences across market
segments.
Entry strategy
We first test the hypotheses related to entry strategy. We use a logit specification in
which, the dependent variable downstream, takes a value of 1 if an entrant entered the
downstream segment. We use an encryption market dummy to control for unobserved
differences across encryption based markets and others. We distinguish between the types of
entrants. We use the log of (1+IT trademarks) as a proxy for the amount of marketing assets of a
firm while we use log (1+Size) as a proxy for scale. Both these variables measure the extent to
which, firms can efficiently produce and sell ISM product(s). We also use the log of the citation

26

weighted number of security patents to control for technical competence.13 In addition we also
control for age (and age squared) of the industry and timing of entry – whether entry was before
or after internet.
Table 9 shows the results. The key independent variable is the number of technology
suppliers, log(1+tech. suppliers). As noted before this variable varies both between market type,
namely encryption vs. non-encryption and also over time.14
Specification 1 shows that the number of IT trademarks held by firms at entry is
associated with higher proportion of entry into the downstream segment. A 1% increase in the
number of IT trademarks is associated with about a 1.9 times higher probability of entering
downstream segment. Specification 2 additionally shows that for size of the firm at time of entry
itself increases the conditional probability of downstream entry.15 A 1% increase in size is
associated with about a 12% higher probability of entering downstream segment. Further the ICT
dummy in specification 1 suggests that diversifying ICT firms are about 1.8 times more likely to
enter downstream segment relative to startups. These findings are consistent with the first
prediction, namely that, firms with larger scale, and higher production and marketing capability
are more likely to enter downstream, conditional on entry. These results are consistent with
Gambardella and Giarratana (2006). By a symmetric argument, these results also suggest that
insofar as startups are less efficient, lacking scale and marketing assets, startups are more likely
to enter technology markets (Arora and Fosfuri, 2003). The coefficient estimate of log(1+
security patents) is negative and significant. This result also supports the argument that patents

13

Since startups have no complementary assets at the time of entry, this variable takes a value of 0 for startups.
About 26 firms do not report size at the time of entry. We start by not controlling for scale, thereby using all 326
observations. In specification 2 we additionally control for scale along with all the independent variables as in
specification 1. However while doing so we lose about 26 observations that relate to firms that do not report number
of employees.
15
Note that we lose 42 observations for which size at entry is not observed in specification 2.
14

27

mediate technology sale, and thus encourage firms to also license their technology (Arora and
Ceccagnoli, 2006).
Result 2 had implied that an increase in competition in market for technology increases
the proportion of entry into the downstream segment. Specifications 1 through 3 show that the
number of specialized technology suppliers increases the proportion of downstream entry. From
specification 2, a 10% increase in the number of technology suppliers is associated with a 95%
higher probability of downstream entry. This is consistent with entry by “licensing” in
technology. In specification 4, we explore if the presence of markets for technology encourages
entry through licensing as implicit in our model. If so, this should be reflected in how
technology markets affect the entry of firms without technology. To this end, we divide all
entrants into those with at least one security patent at the time of entry and those with none. It is
plausible that firms with at least one patent are much more likely to possess technology than
those without a patent. We run two separate logistic regressions, one on a sample of firms that at
least one patent at the time of entry and another on a sample of firms that had no patents at the
time of entry.16

16

We use two separate regressions in view of the potential problems with interaction terms in nonlinear regression
models (Ai and Norton, 2003).

We use the same set of controls as specification 1. The independent variable of interest is
the number of technology suppliers. The results imply that an increase in the number of
technology suppliers increases the proportion of firms without patents entering downstream,
whereas the effect is weaker and statistically insignificant for firms with at least one security
patent. The point estimates suggest that among firms without patents, a 1% increase in
technology suppliers increases the proportion of downstream entry by about 8.4 times, whereas

29

for patentees, a 1% increase in technology suppliers decreases the proportion of firms that enter
downstream by 1.2 times. The differential impact of markets for technology on firms with and
without patents suggests that what our results are picking up is not simply unobserved
differences across encryption and other markets, but rather properties of industries with markets
for technology. Recall that in our model, an increase in the number of licensors directly
increased entry by firms lacking technology, whereas for firms with technology, the effect was to
shift firms from a mixed model (both licensing and products) to purely products. Our empirical
results suggest that the increased entry of firms without technology is more pronounced than the
shift in the business model of entrants with technology.
Of course, firms do not have to buy technology in order to be downstream. The
coefficient of ICT dummy suggests that diversifying ICT firms, even when they have patents, are
likely to enter downstream and not engage themselves in technology licensing. This is especially
true for firms with marketing assets (IT trademarks) and for larger firms. All of this is consistent
with the finding in Arora and Ceccagnoli (2005) that patents facilitate licensing, but only firms
that lack specialized complementary capabilities.
To summarize, our results suggest that diversifiers are more likely to enter downstream
segments. We also find evidence of markets for technology stimulating entry through licensing,
especially by firms that have marketing capabilities and scale, while not affecting entry by firms
with proprietary technology.
Performance
In this section, we explore the determinants of performance using Cox proportional
hazard regressions of exit. We consider startups at risk of exit from the time the startup was
established while diversifying entrants are at risk from the time of entry into ISM. Observations
that relate to firms that were still alive at 2004 were considered as censored observations.

30

Moreover, we also considered as censored observations where the firm was acquired on friendly
terms, excluding distress sales which are treated as exits.
The use of survival as a measure of performance is very common (Klepper and Simons
2000a; Carroll et al.1996; Klepper and Sleeper 2005; Thompson 2005). It is possible, however,
that exit decisions of incumbent diversifiers may differ from those of startups. Diversifiers may
have deeper pockets, or may be willing to lose a little money in security markets to achieve other
goals. On the other hand, startups tend of founders that identify personally with the business and
may tend to linger on long after it is clear that the business is not viable. Thus, though exit
decisions may depart from the expected profitability of the firm, the resulting bias, if any, is
unclear.
We use the same set of firm and market characteristics as before.17 Additionally, to allow
for time and age dependence, we control for the age and square of the age of the firm(using ISM
tenure and ISM tenure2), as well as the whether entry before 1995. Finally, with the exception of
specification 2, we also control for the number of producers within the same submarket
(competitors) to control for the intensity of competition.
As is the case with many other industries, diversifiers survive longer than startups. In
specification 1, diversifiers are almost 80% less likely to exit relative to startups. Note that all
other sources of advantage find support as well. Result 4 implied that scale and marketing assets
should improve performance, as should proprietary technology. The estimation results broadly
confirm this. A 1% increase in size is associated with about 18% decrease in exit hazard, while a
1% increase in IT trademarks is associated with a 31% decrease in exit hazard. Having
proprietary security technology is beneficial -- a 1% increase in security patents is associated

the firm did not report size.

31

with 10% decrease in exit probability, though this effect is not statistically significant. Entry
prior to the growth of the internet does not help survival. This suggests that the first mover
advantage, if any, must manifest itself in scale, patents or marketing assets.
Results in specification 2 suggest that omitting the number of competitors does not affect
our principal results, and our estimate of competition by itself is small and insignificant. This is
in part perhaps an artifact of measurement error in our measure of competitors: We do not
include multi-product firms that operate in the same submarket. 18
There are several possible sources of advantage that diversifiers may enjoy: scale economies,
which enable firms to undertake larger fixed investments in improving efficiency and lowering
cost (Cohen and Klepper, 1992; complementary capabilities (Teece, 1986), superior technology
and R&D capabilities (Klepper and Simons, 2000a), or superior marketing capabilities (Mitchell,
1989). A variant is the suggestion that it is early entry rather than incumbency which matters,
because early entry allows more time for growth and the consequent benefits of scale (Klepper,
1996; Klepper and Simons, 2000). Since we control for patents, IT trademarks, and size at entry,
and because related startups (including spinoffs from security firms themselves) do not perform
better than unrelated startups, it appears that these do not exhaust the sources of this superior
operating efficiency. Nor is it due to experience in the ICT industry per se. Though we
acknowledge that our proxies for scale, marketing and technology are imperfect, the results
potentially point to additional sources of advantage for incumbent firms diversifying into the
ISM. These may include superior managerial capability or managerial routines, existing

18

Although we are able to identify the market where the firm initially enters, it is likely that some firms operate in
multiple markets thereafter. Thus, our measure of the number of producers in a market is likely to have considerable
measurement error. It appears that this error attenuates the estimated coefficient of the number of producers, but
does not appear to affect estimates of other variables.

32

relationships with corporate clients, or superior financial resources. It may also simply reflect
strategic differences between diversifiers and startups in the value of “staying on” in the ISM.
Result 3 implies that specialized technology suppliers should increase the average rate of
exit from product markets. Indeed, from column 1 a 1% increase in the number of technology
suppliers is associated with about a 2% increase in exit probability. This is an interesting result.
It suggests that though they lower entry barriers and increase entry, by increasing subsequent
competition, technology markets do also increase exit.
In specifications 3 and 4 we test result 5. We interact our measure of the number of
technology suppliers with our measures of scale, marketing and proprietary technology. In result
4 we additionally interact the number of technology suppliers with the dummy for ICT
diversifiers.
Specification 3 results show that the increase in exit rates is moderated by trademarks and
by scale. The results imply that a 1% increase in IT trademarks is associated with about a 23%
decrease in the hazard of exit in the absence of technology suppliers, whereas a 1% increase in
IT trademarks is associated with about a 65% decrease in the average hazard of exit for every
percentage increase in technology suppliers. Thus every percentage point increase in technology
suppliers implies an additional 42% advantage for every 1% increase in the ownership of IT
trademarks. The estimates with respect to size are similar. In markets that do no have any
technology suppliers, a 1% increase in size implies a 13% decrease in the average hazard of exit.
However, in product markets that have technology suppliers, a 1% increase in technology
suppliers implies an additional 57% reduction in the average hazard of exit for every percentage
point change in size.

statistically insignificant. Other results however do not change much. That the impact of markets
for technology differs by scale and marketing assets confirms the predictions of Result 5 .
Equally important, it provides reassurance that what we are measuring is not simply the result of
unobserved differences across markets.
Our findings on performance by different types of entrants also reinforce the findings in
the literature. First, diversifying entrants perform better than startups. This finding is very
similar to similar findings in other industries such as automobiles (Carroll et at 1996), televisions
(Klepper & Simmons 2000) and ship-building (Thompson 2002). We find that markets for
technology magnify the importance of these other assets, particularly scale and marketing assets.
Intuitively, where well-functioning technology markets exist, operational efficiency becomes
even more relevant for performance.
Robustness and alternative explanations:
It is possible that our estimates are picking up the heterogeneity between entrant types not
adequately controlled for in the regressions. We explore if this affects our principal results of
interest using specifications 3 of table 9 and specification 5 of table 10. In both these
specifications, we control for different types of entrants not simply between diversifying ICT
firms and startups. Our principal results are substantively unchanged, suggesting that the
heterogeneity if any between different entrants do not significantly bias our estimates. However,
in the performance regression, in which, we also distinguish among the different types of startups
(specification 5 of table 10), indicates two other surprising effects of prior experience. Contrary
to expectations, spinoffs and startups founded by employees of ICT firms do not perform as well
as unrelated startups. Startups founded by founders from unrelated industries perform markedly
better than all other types of startups, albeit not as well as diversifiers. These results suggest that

35

prior operational experience of diversifying ICT firms perhaps does not explain why diversifiers
perform better. We discuss this finding in greater detail below.
Next, we test the robustness of our results with respect the hypotheses that relate to
market for technology. A possible concern is that our estimates reflect unobserved differences
between the various market segments. To address this concern, we estimated the differences in
the entry strategy of firms with and without patents, and how the presence of technology
suppliers differentially affected the entry strategy of these groups. To further explore the
robustness of our results, especially those that relate to Result 2, we identified if firms within the
encryption market (authentication and network security submarkets) entered by licensing an
encryption technology at the time of entry (licensee =1) or not (licensee =0). Of a total of 216
firms in encryption based product markets, we were able to identify this for a sub-sample of 20
firms. Of these, 20 firms do not report their size. Hence we use 100 observations in the
regression that relates to entry strategy, while we use 120 observations in the survival regression.
This sample has similar characteristics (not reported here) as the sample of all firms in the
encryption market.
We first test if increased competition in encryption technology market encourages firms
to enter the ISM by licensing an encryption technology. Since the decision to license and
entering downstream segment may be simultaneously determined, we implement a bivariate
probit regression (results presented in table 11) in which, the dependent variables are
downstream and licensee. Using log(1+security patents) we also test if licensees are firms that
do not have a proprietary technology of their own in the licensor equation.

The results reinforce the results on entry discussed earlier. In the licensee equation, the
coefficient of technology suppliers is positive and significant suggesting that the number of
technology suppliers encourage entry by licensing. The coefficient of log(1+security patents) is
negative and significant, reinforcing the finding that firms with proprietary technology are less
likely to enter by licensing. The coefficient estimate of ICT firms dummy is positive, albeit
marginally significant, suggesting diversifying ICT firms are more likely to enter by licensing.
The results of the downstream equation reinforce the principal results stated in the previous
section. Since these results are only for encryption based markets, they suggest that the role of
unobserved heterogeneity across markets, if any, do not significantly bias the principal results
presented in the previous section.
We then test the robustness of our performance results.We use the same set of controls as
in table 10. In addition we use licensee dummy as well as licensee dummy interacted with
log(1+tech. suppliers). The results, shown in column 2 of table 11, reinforce our main findings.
The number of technology suppliers increases the hazard of exit on an average. Moreover,
licensees perform well only when they are many technology suppliers. Once again, these results
suggest that it is unlikely that our principal findings are driven by unobserved differences
between encryption and non-encryption markets but rather due to the effects of market for
technology.

6. Discussion and conclusion
Our results from the analysis of entry and exit in ISM confirm the principal findings in the
literature, but also provide some interesting avenues for further research. They confirm the
independent role of technology, marketing, and scale in facilitating performance and
conditioning entry. Despite this, differences in the type of entrant have large effects in both

38

entry and exit. In particular, diversifiers outperform startups, including spinoffs and startups
from related industries, indicating that incumbent firms diversifying into a new industry bring
not just size, marketing assets, proprietary technology and experience, but also something else,
which appears conditions entry strategy and to confer significant survival benefit.
This is corroborated by how entry and survival respond to the presence of markets for
technology, which appear to enhance the advantages of operational efficiency, whose source we
conjecture may lie in superior firm-routines (for instance, to maintain and upgrade products),
superior management ability, or perhaps superior relationships with existing customers.
The source of the advantages enjoyed by incumbent ICT firms diversifying into information
security markets cannot be conclusively answered. Not only do we fail to measure all the
possible sources of advantage, but those that we do measure, we measure only imperfectly.
Trademarks may not capture all important elements of marketing assets, such as the quality of
the sales and marketing teams, existing relationships with customers, or the level of branding.
Similarly, patents are but one manifestation of the technology. Clever virus researchers rarely
produce patentable technology. Yet, without their ability to detect and counter new viruses and
worms, the scanning and pattern matching technology that underpins anti-virus products (and
which is patentable) would not be very useful.
Even with these qualifications our results point to some interesting avenues for further
research. In particular, the finding that firms founded by founders from unrelated industries
perform better than other startups, including those with founders with ICT experience, as well as
spinoffs from information security firms themselves, requires further exploration. We conjecture
that the ISM differs from many of the industries studied by other scholars in the area of
entrepreneurship in several important aspects. The first is the absence of manufacturing.

39

Although software products must be scaled up, maintained and enhanced, they do not require the
large fixed investments of manufacturing, the reduction of production costs for performance, or
the associated benefit of manufacturing experience. Undoubtedly, this is an important reason
that unrelated startups can succeed.
Second, the widespread use of information technology and the relative ease of obtaining raw
material for R&D (such as access to computers and software) perhaps allows individuals that do
not have technical expertise to tinker with existing software in order to develop valuable ideas.
One can perhaps draw parallels to the success of private inventors such as Edison at the turn of
the century. We speculate that the nature of the industry makes it possible for entrepreneurs with
meager resources to tinker, develop innovations, and in some cases, hold more than hold their
own against larger, established rivals. It may also be that software offers the possibility of
creating many more niches as compared with manufactured products, perhaps because one does
not need large fixed investments in manufacturing.
Third, the lack of success enjoyed by related startups and spinoffs as compared to startups
from other backgrounds is also intriguing, particularly since other researchers have found a very
significant role for pre-entry industry experience. We conjecture that this reflects the general
purpose nature of software technologies. Banks, insurance firms, government organizations – all
are likely to have substantial in-house capability for information security. Thus, they are also
plausibly potent sources for creating new firms dealing with information security. In this, ISM
may differ from products such as televisions, radios, and automobiles, though perhaps not lasers.
Fourth, differences in the nature of demand across encryption and other markets may also be
important. Economists frequently assume, implicitly or otherwise, that buyers are households.
Though households do buy anti-virus and spam control products, network security products

40

(such as VPN) are largely bought by businesses. In their purchase decisions, the price and
quality of the product are not the only considerations; businesses also place considerable weight
on the reputation and reliability of the seller, and whether they have established business
relationships with the seller. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that even individuals without
significant technical experience but perhaps with superior technical skills and more importantly a
willingness to monitor and respond to ongoing developments (such as the release of new viruses
and worms) could break into markets where households are an important source of demand.19
However, established firms would hold sway in markets dominated by business buyers,
particularly if they could get access to technology via a market for technology, as is true for
encryption products.
Finally, the most important insights from our results are in the impact of the vertical structure
of the industry on entry and exit. Specifically, our research shows how markets for technology
conditions entry, exit and competition. Markets for technology encourage vertical specialization
and increases entry, especially by firms that do not have proprietary technology. However, a
competitive technology market also stimulates competition in the related product market and
increases exit rates. In particular markets for technology increase the relative importance of hardto-replicate-assets such as marketing ability and scale, while they hasten exit by firms that do not
hold these assets.

19

In firewalls, the ability to sell an “add-on” product, rather than one that would be deeply embedded in the buyer’s
network infrastructure also helped.

Firms that enter through licensing by definition enter downstream. Therefore, if there is an
increase in the probability of entry of firms without technology, the overall proportion of entrants
entering downstream must increase.
To see that entry by firms without technology increases, note that an increase in b lowers
p. For p to fall there has to be additional production in the product market. This increase in
production cannot be due to firms with technology, since their expected profits in the product
market are lower, and lower prices will not imply additional entry of firms endowed with
technology. Therefore, it must be due to entry of firms without technology.

7. Proof of result 3:
The exit probability of exit conditional entry, averaged over firms of different sizes is
