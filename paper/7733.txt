ABSTRACT
In the wake of the 1994 School-to-Work Opportunities Act (STWOA), we introduce and
study two new data sources to estimate the extent to which school-to-work programs have been
implemented in U.S. high schools, and the extent to which high school students are participating in
these programs. The first data source, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 (NLSY97),
provides information directly form students on whether they participated in these programs. The
second source, the 1996 School Administrators’s Survey, was administered to schools attended by
NLSY97 interviewees, and provides information directly from schools on whether they offered any
school-to-work programs.
Findings from the 1996 School Administrator’s Survey show that school-to-work programs
are commonly offered, with over 60 percent of schools providing at least one such program.
Findings from the NLSY97 show that a fair number of high school students participate in school-towork programs, with about 38 percent of students reporting participation in at least one program.
The findings concerning whether schools with disadvantaged student populations are more likely to
offer school-to-work programs, or whether less-advantaged students are more likely to participate
in these programs, are mixed.

In 1994 Congress passed the School-to-Work Opportunities Act (STWOA) that provided
federally-funded grants to States and local partnerships of business, government, education and
community organizations to develop “school-to-work systems.”1 The law encouraged States and
their local partners to develop the model that would work best for them. As a result, the features of
school-to-work programs are hard to describe and can vary from grant to grant. The Act did,
however, outline three core elements that school-to-work programs must have: a school-based
learning component; a work-based learning component; and a connecting activities component.2
•

•

School-based learning encompasses rigorous classroom instruction that is linked to
workplace experiences and provides students with the information and skills needed to
identify and prepare for promising careers.
Work-based learning includes work experience, structured training, and other workplace
learning experiences appropriate to students’ career interests and linked to school
curricula.
Connecting activities are efforts undertaken to help employers and schools forge and
maintain links between the school-based and work-based components.

The general goal of the STWOA is to improve the transitions from school to work for all
youths in the U.S . The Act points to a “lack of a comprehensive and coherent system to help youths
acquire the knowledge, skills, abilities, and information about and access to the labor market that are
necessary to make an effective transition from school to work or further education.” 3
In the wake of the STWOA of 1994, we are interested in studying the extent to which schoolto-work programs have been implemented in our nation’s high schools and the extent to which high
school students are choosing to participate in these programs. To do this, we use two exciting new
data sources. The first source, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 (NLSY97),
provides information directly from students on whether they participated in these programs. The
second source, the 1996 School Administrator’s Survey (SAS96), was administered to schools
attended by NLSY97 interviewees, and provides information directly from schools on whether they
offered any school-to-work programs. Using these two data sources, we can examine the prevalence

1

of school-to-work programs from two different perspectives and also investigate what types of
schools tend to offer the programs and what types of students tend to participate in school-to-work
programs.
There are several attractive features of these data. First, the two surveys asked about a
number of different types of school-to-work programs, thus allowing analysis to be done on both
work-based and school-based activities. Second, the two surveys asked about the same programs
and used similar definitions. Third, responses for the schools in the SAS96 can be linked to those
for individuals in the NLSY97. Finally, the surveys collected extensive information on the
characteristics of the schools and the youths, thus allowing researchers to examine the characteristics
of the high schools that offer school-to-work programs as well as the characteristics of the students
who participate. Ultimately these data will also be an excellent source for studying the effectiveness
of school-to-work programs in helping students settle into their careers, but the currently available
data do not yet support this line of inquiry.4
Data
1996 School Administrator’s Survey (SAS96). The National School-to-Work Office sponsored a
supplemental data collection effort within the NLSY97 to support their overall research interest in
understanding the effectiveness of the STWOA. The purpose of the SAS96 was to measure at the
school level the extent to which schools offer school-to-work programs and to determine which
types of schools have these programs. The sample for the survey was all schools with a 12th grade
within the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs)5 of the NLSY97. The questionnaire asked questions on
the following items: school policies; student, teacher, and administrator characteristics; and schoolto-work programs. The SAS96 questionnaire was mailed to 7,985 schools in September of 1996. Of
these schools, 595 were found to be out-of-scope either because the school no longer existed or

2

because it did not contain a 12th grade. Of the 7,390 remaining schools, responses were received
from 5,295, or 71.6% of the sample. Among these 5,295 responses, 42 failed to answer any of the
first 11 questions in the school-to-work section and were dropped from the analysis.
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the 5,253 schools used in the analysis.6 We focus
on characteristics of the school that are related to the quality of the school, as well as characteristics
that indicate something about the socioeconomic status of the school’s student population. These
characteristics include: whether the school is private or public; school size; school location; the
graduation rate at the school; the percent of the school’s graduates that enroll in a 4-year college; the
racial and ethnic composition of the students; and whether or not the school offered a school
breakfast program, Title I services,7 or a dropout prevention program.
NLSY97. The first round of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997, was administered in
1997 to a nationally representative sample of 8,984 young men and women who were ages 12 to 16
as of December 31, 1996. The survey was administered through personal interviews with the youth
and one of his or her parents and gathered extensive information on the youth’s labor market
behavior, education and training, family and community background, as well as important life events
such as marriage or the birth a child. These youths will continue to be surveyed annually as they
make the transition from school to work.
In the 1997 interview, youths who have attended 9th grade or higher were asked a number of
questions about participation in school programs designed to help them prepare for the world of
work. Of the 8,984 respondents, 4,484 were asked the school-to-work questions.8 The analysis in
this paper is restricted to these respondents and table 2 provides some basic descriptive information
on this group. The first column of table 2 provides the number of respondents with a particular

3

characteristic and the second column provides the weighted percentage that those respondents
represent in the national population of youths born between 1980 and 1984.
The sample contains roughly equal numbers of girls and boys. However, given the ages of
the NLSY97 cohort, the majority of the high school respondents were in 9th and 10th grades in 1997.
Only 74 respondents of the 4,484 were in 12th grade or higher. To the extent that participation in
school-to-work programs is greater in the upper grades of high school, which we suspect is likely,
our estimates of overall participation from the NLSY97 would underestimate school-to-work
participation in high school.9 The other variables listed in table 2 are characteristics of the youth that
we thought may be related to participation in school-to-work programs. These characteristics can be
divided into two groups. The first set consists of characteristics related to socioeconomic status and
is aimed at assessing the extent to which disadvantaged youths are targeted for school-to-work
programs. These characteristics include: gender; race; ethnicity; household income; education level
of the youth’s biological mother; whether the youth attends a public or private school; and whether
the youth lives in an urban or rural location. The second set includes other characteristics that are
related to the youth’s work or school performance and are aimed at investigating what kinds of
students tend to participate in these programs. These include: grades in 8th grade; whether or not the
youth is currently working; his or her expectations for completing college; and the course of study
the youth is pursuing in high school.
School-to-work programs
Under the guidance of the National School-to-Work Office, a limited number of school-to-work
programs were chosen for inclusion in both the SAS96 and the NLSY97 questionnaires. These
programs are: internship/apprenticeship (asked about separately in SAS96 but combined in
NLSY97); job shadowing; mentoring; school-sponsored enterprise; career major; and cooperative

4

education. The definitions given to respondents in the two surveys are similar but not identical.
(See Appendix 1.)
Even though the two surveys ask about the same programs, the students and the school
administrators may not interpret the questions in exactly the same way. For example, a student who
has received some career counseling may incorrectly respond that they participated in a “career
major” program, whereas a school administrator, who may have read the definition more closely,
would not categorize career counseling as a “career major” program.
Given that the schools in the SAS96 were selected from the PSUs where the NLSY97 youths
live, we are able to match the NLSY97 youths with the high schools that they attend to examine the
consistency in reporting of school-to-work programs between youths and schools. If the school
reports offering a program and the student does not report participating, then no inconsistency need
exist, since some students may not participate. On the other hand, if a school reports not offering a
particular program and the student reports participating in this program then there is a potential
inconsistency. However, there are instances where this may be valid. In the NLSY97 survey, the
youth was asked whether they “ever” participated in these programs and not whether they
participated in the programs at their current school, so it is possible that the youth could have
participated in the program at another school or through an another organization (i.e., church,
business group, or civic organization).
Table 3 shows participation rates in school-to-work programs for four different groups of
youths who have attended 9th grade or higher: all youths; youths in schools that reported having the
program; youths in schools that reported no corresponding program; youths in schools that did not
participate in the SAS96.

5

The results in Table 3 are troubling as the participation rates among youths in schools with a
particular program are very similar to (although slightly higher than) those of youths in schools not
offering the program. It is not clear whether the schools or the youths are incorrectly reporting. One
problem with the school survey data is the substantial non-response to individual questions about
school-to-work programs; roughly 12 to 18 percent of administrators did not respond to individual
questions on whether or not the school offered a particular program. In defining whether a school
offered a program in table 3, we treated non-responses as “no” responses. For instance, if a school
administrator did not respond to the question on whether the school offered an apprenticeship
program then it was assumed that the school did not have the program. Because this approach could
result in misclassifying a school as not offering a program when in fact they do (but just failed to
respond), we recalculated table 3 treating non-responses to a particular program as non-respondents
(i.e., we moved youths in these schools to the last column). This reduced the discrepancy slightly
but by no means eliminated it. Another possible explanation for the potential inconsistency between
school and youth reports is misclassification on the part of the youth. It may be that youths do not
fully understand the definitions of the various school-to-work programs and thus misreport their
participation. It may be that youths participated in some type of program, but it did not meet the
definition provided in the school survey.
Short of conducting a validation study, we have no way of knowing the source of the
reporting error. As a result, the actual levels of participation rates by youths and incidence rates by
schools should be viewed as rough estimates. However, unless reporting errors vary systematically
by youth or school characteristics, differences across groups in participation or offering rates should
be less affected by measurement error.

6

Incidence rates in the SAS96
According to the 1996 School Administrator’s Survey as reported in table 4, 64.2 percent of schools
with a 12th grade offered at least one school-to-work program to their students.10 The most prevalent
work-based activity offered by schools was job shadowing, with roughly 29 percent of schools
offering such programs. Job shadowing was followed by internship, mentoring, apprenticeship, and
school-sponsored enterprise programs, with incidence rates for these programs ranging from 13 to 17
percent. In 1996, school-based activities were more commonly offered by schools than were workbased activities. Tech prep and cooperative education programs were the most common schoolbased activities and were offered by approximately 33 percent of schools. Career major programs
were the least prevalent, with 13.2 percent of schools offering them.
In table 5, we examine the extent to which schools offer more than one of these school-towork programs. While 64 percent of schools offered at least one program, 26 percent offered three
or more programs and about 9 percent offered five or more programs. About 22 percent of schools
offered only one program, while 31 percent of schools offered at least one work-based and one
school-based activity.
Table 6 shows the proportion of schools offering various school-to-work programs by
characteristics of the school and its student body. In the discussion that follows, we only mention
differences in incidence rates that were found to be statistically significant.11 In general, private
schools have much smaller incidence rates for school-to-work programs. Only 24 percent of private
schools offered at least one school-to-work program in 1996, compared with 78 percent of public
schools. Incidence rates for each individual school-to-work program were also considerably lower
among private schools than public schools. Among public schools, the percent of schools providing
any school-to-work program was highest among medium-size schools (i.e., schools with 750-1,500

7

students). This size pattern among public schools also holds for most of the individual school-towork programs. Among private schools, the largest schools (i.e., schools with more than 300
students) were more likely to offer any school-to-work programs. However, this size pattern does
not consistently hold for all of the various school-to-work programs.
In 1996, a higher percentage of suburban schools offered school-to-work programs than did
urban or rural schools. This was particularly true for apprenticeship, school-sponsored enterprise,
cooperative education, and tech prep programs. School-to-work programs were considerably less
prevalent in schools with high graduation rates and a high percentage of graduates who go on to
attend 4-year colleges. Table 6 shows that schools where 98 percent or more of the students
graduate had incidence rates for any school-to-work programs of 43 percent compared to roughly 70
percent for schools with lower graduation rates. Similar differences are found between schools
where 68 percent or more of the students attend a 4-year college and schools with lower college
enrollment rates. These elite high schools were also less likely to offer each of the individual types
of school-to-work programs.
As previously mentioned, the STWOA emphasizes the need to improve the transition from
school to work for all students but especially students from disadvantaged backgrounds. To see if
school-to-work programs are more typical for such students, we next show how incidence rates of
school-to-work programs vary with our descriptors for disadvantaged student bodies.
Schools in which 25-75 percent of the student body is black tended to have higher incidence
rates for any school-to-work programs than did schools where less than 25 percent of the student
body is black. This pattern also holds for the provision of apprenticeship, internship, mentoring,
career major, and cooperative education programs. Provision of job shadowing programs, however,
was highest among schools with the lowest percentage of black students. The provision of school-

8

to-work programs does not appear to vary systematically by the percentage of Hispanic students.
However, schools that offer a breakfast program or a dropout prevention program were more likely
to provide school-to-work programs. The results for Title I schools were mixed, with higher
incidence rates than non-Title I schools for some school-to-work programs and lower incidence rates
for other programs.
So far in the analysis, we have separately shown incidence rates for school-to-work programs
by various characteristics of the schools. In the following, we use logistic regression analysis to
estimate the probability that a school with any given set of characteristics offers school-to-work
programs. This approach allows us to see the independent relationship of a particular characteristic
with incidence rates while holding constant the relationship of school-to-work programs to other
characteristics.
We ran logistic regressions for three different dependent variables: provision of any schoolto-work program; provision of any work-based program; and provision of any school-based
program. Table 7 provides the odds ratios obtained from the logistic regressions. The odds ratios
indicate how much more likely schools that differ with respect to a particular characteristic (e.g.,
private schools) are to offer a given program compared to other schools (e.g., public schools). An
odds ratio of 2 on the dummy variable for private school indicates that private schools are twice as
likely to offer school-to-work programs as public schools; similarly, an odds ratios of 1 indicates that
they are equally likely and an odds ratio of .5 indicates that they are half as likely. For
characteristics that are continuous such as school size, the odds ratio tells us how much more likely
schools that are 1 unit away from the mean for that characteristic are to offer a given program
compared to schools at the mean for that characteristic. Since a 1-unit change is not always the most
meaningful, we divided school size by 100 and the percent black and Hispanic by 10 before entering

9

them into the logistic analysis. By doing this, the resulting odds ratio for school size represents the
change attributable to a change in school size of 100, and the odds ratio for percent black or
Hispanic represents the change attributable to a 10 percentage-point change in the percent black or
Hispanic.
The results from the logistic regression analysis for the most part confirm findings from the
crosstab analysis. Namely, private schools are significantly less likely to provide school-to-work
programs than are public schools. They are .3 times as likely as public schools to provide any workbased programs and .1 as likely to provided any school-based programs. School size is slightly
positively related to provision of school-to-work programs, particularly school-based programs.
However, among private schools, large school are slightly less likely to offer school-to-work
programs. In terms of location, urban schools are less likely than suburban schools to provide
school-based programs, while rural schools are less likely than suburban schools to provide workbased programs.
Schools with the highest graduation rates are less likely than other schools to provide any
school-to-work programs, work-based programs, or school-based programs. Schools with the highest
percentage of graduates going on to 4-year colleges are also less likely to provide any school-towork program, but particularly school-based programs.
The findings concerning whether schools with disadvantaged student populations are more
likely to offer school-to-work programs are mixed. The percent of black students at a school does
not significantly affect the probability of providing school-to-work programs, whereas the percent
Hispanic is slightly negatively related to provision of these programs. Furthermore, Title I schools
are slightly less likely than non-Title I schools to offer school-to-work programs, but schools with
dropout prevention programs are more likely to offer school-to-work programs.

10

Participation rates in NLSY97
After examining how many and what types of schools report offering school-to-work programs, we
now turn to the question of how many students report participation in these programs and what kinds
of students participate. To examine participation in school-to-work programs, we use data from the
NLSY97. As reported in table 8, that survey shows that 38 percent of youths who have attended 9th
grade or higher participated in at least one of the school-to-work programs covered in the survey.
Among work-based activities, job shadowing was the most prevalent with nearly 13 percent
of youths participating in such programs, followed by school-sponsored enterprise at 9.1 percent,
and apprenticeships/internships and mentoring programs with participation rates of roughly 4
percent. In terms of school-based learning activities, the most common program was career major,
with 18.2 percent of youths reporting having participated in such a program. This was followed by
tech prep at 7.6 percent and cooperative education at 6.8 percent.
Table 9 shows the extent to which youths participate in more than one of these school-towork programs. Participation in multiple programs is not all that common. Only 6 percent of youths
participated in 3 or more programs and less than 1 percent participated in 5 or more programs.
About 10 percent of youths who have attended grade 9 or higher participated in at least one workbased activity and one school-based activity. The majority of students that participated in at least
one program tended to participate in only one, as 23 percent of youths reported participating in only
one activity.
What types of students tend to participate in school-to-work programs? Table 10 shows
participation rates in the various programs by characteristics of the youth that may influence the
quality of worker that the youth ultimately may become when he or she joins the workforce. In the

11

discussion that follows, we only mention differences in participation rates across groups that were
found to be statistically significant.12
Participation in any school-to-work program does not vary by youths’ average grades in 8th
grade. However, participation rates in certain programs do differ by grade point average. For
example, youths who received mostly Cs and Bs had higher participation rates in
apprenticeship/internship programs than youths with higher grades. Participation in job shadowing
was highest for students who received mostly As and Bs.
Youths who are working are also more likely to participate in school-to-work programs.
Forty-three percent of the youths who reported working during the survey week participated in at
least one school-to-work program, compared with 36 percent of the youths who did not work.
Participation rates in most of the individual programs were also higher for working youths.
As was already mentioned, the STWOA emphasizes the need to make school-to-work
programs available to all students. But are youths who do not intend or expect to receive any formal
education after high school as likely to participate in these programs as college-bound youths? In
order to address this question, we examine how participation in various school-to-work programs
differs by the youth’s self-reported expectations about completing college, while recognizing that
these expectations may be influenced by school-to-work programs. In the NLSY97 questionnaire,
youths were asked: “What is the percent chance that you will have a four-year college degree by the
time you turn 30?” Youths were then placed into four groups: those who said they had zero chance
of receiving a college degree; a 1-33 percent chance; a 34-66 percent chance; and over a 66 percent
chance. Surprisingly, almost 70 percent of the youths reported a greater than 66 percent chance of
obtaining a 4-year college degree and only 5 percent said they had no expectations of completing a
degree (see table 2). Findings in Table 10 show that, if anything, individuals who perceive

12

themselves as more likely to complete college have greater participation in school-to-work
programs.
Participation in school-to-work programs was considerably higher for youths who
characterized their course of study in high school as being a vocational, technical, or business
program as compared to a general or college preparatory program. This strong positive relationship
is not surprising given that vocational, technical, or business-oriented programs are by their nature
more focused on linking educational curricula to careers.
Table 11 shows participation rates in the various programs by characteristics of the youth that
are related to his or her socioeconomic status. These characteristics are of interest given the
emphasis placed in the STWOA on providing school-to-work opportunities to youths that may
ultimately become school dropouts or have difficulties in the workforce.
Although labor force participation rates of women are approaching those for men, gender
differences still exist in terms of occupational choices and long-term attachment to the workforce,
which may influence boys’ and girls’ decisions to participate in certain school-to-work programs.
Overall, participation rates in school-to-work programs are similar for males and females. However,
high school girls are more likely than their male counterparts to participate in a job shadowing
program and high school boys are more likely than their female counterparts to participate in a tech
prep program.
Findings from NLSY97 indicate that black youths are more likely than other racial groups to
participate in at least one school-to-work program. Blacks also had higher participation rates than
whites in the following programs: apprenticeship or internship; mentoring; career major; cooperative
education; and tech prep programs. Hispanics, on the other hand, were less likely than non-

13

Hispanics to participate in at least one school-to-work program, with significantly lower
participation in job shadowing, school-sponsored enterprise, and career major programs.
As part of the interview with the youth’s parent, information was collected on total income
for the household in which the youth resides. Using this information, we were able to group the
youths into four equal-sized income groups to see if participation in school-to-work programs varies
by household income. Participation rates in any school-to-work program do not vary systematically
by income level. However, some differences do exist for individual programs. Youths in the
highest income group were more likely to participate in job shadowing programs than youths in the
lowest income group. And youths in the bottom two income groups were more likely to participate
in a career major program than were youths in the highest income group. Youths in the highest
income group were also less likely than youths in the lowest income group to participate in
cooperative education programs.
Although participation rates did not vary much by students’ college expectations, the
education level of the youth’s biological mother does appear to be negatively related to participation
in school-to-work programs. Youths whose mothers are college graduates are less likely to
participate in at least one school-to-work program than are youths whose mothers are only high
school graduates. This relationship also holds for participation in apprenticeship or internship,
career major, cooperative education, and tech prep programs. Youths whose mothers have less than
a high school education are less likely to participate in at least one school-to-work program than are
youths whose mothers are high school graduates.
Consistent with the finding from the school survey, youths attending private high schools are
less likely to participate in school-to-work programs compared to those attending public schools.

14

Approximately 26 percent of youths in private schools participated in at least one school-to-work
program, whereas nearly 39 percent of public school students did.
Similar to the strategy used in analyzing the school data, we now turn to our logistic
regression analyses that estimate the probability that a youth with any given set of characteristics
participates in school-to-work programs. This approach allows us to see the independent
relationship of a particular characteristic with participation rates while holding constant the
relationship of other characteristics.
We ran logistic regressions for three different dependent variables: participation in any
school-to-work program; participation in any work-based program; and participation in any schoolbased program. Table 12 provides the odds ratios obtained from the logistic regressions.
Findings from the logistic regression analysis confirm many of the crosstab results previously
discussed. Youths who work are more likely (about 1.3 times more likely) to participate in any
school-to-work program and any work-based program. Youths who characterized their course of
study as general are less likely than college preparatory students to participate in any school-to-work
program and any work-based program, whereas those who characterized their course of study as
vocational, technical, or business-oriented are more than twice as likely as college preparatory
students to participate in any school-to-work program and any school-based program. Black youths
are more likely than white youths to participate in any program, any work-based program, and any
school-based program. Students who attend private schools are less likely to participate in any
program, any work-based program, and any school-based program than are students who attend
public school. Lastly, students whose mothers are college graduates are slightly less likely to
participate in any program and any school-based program than are students whose mothers are only
high school graduates.

Summary
In this article we have examined the question “How common are school-to-work programs?” from
two different perspectives: the first from the perspective of the nation’s high schools; and the second
from the perspective of the students. Findings from the 1996 School Administrator’s Survey show
that school-to-work programs are commonly offered in American high schools, with over 60 percent
of schools providing at least one such program. Findings from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth, 1997, show that a fair number of high school students are participating in school-to-work
programs, with about 38 percent of students reporting having participated in at least one program.
However, we have some concerns about the quality of the school-to-work data from these two
sources, as sizable numbers of students in schools that supposedly do not have school-to-work
programs reported participating in them.
In addition to the question of prevalence, we also addressed the questions “What types of
schools offer school-to-work programs?” and “What types of students participate in them?” The
findings indicate that private and elite (i.e., high graduation and college attendance rates) high
schools are less likely to offer school-to-work programs. The findings concerning whether schools
with disadvantaged student populations are more likely to offer school-to-work programs are mixed.
On the one hand, schools with dropout prevention programs are more likely to offer school-to-work
programs, but on the other hand schools with high percentages of Hispanic students and schools
receiving Title I funding are less likely to offer these programs. In terms of students, youths who are
working are more likely to participate in school-to-work programs, as are youths who reported their
course of study in high school as technical, vocational, or business-oriented. Also, blacks are more
likely than whites to participate in school-to-work programs, whereas youths with high household
incomes and youths whose mothers are highly educated are less likely to participate.

Appendix 1
Definitions of school-to-work programs in the NLSY97 and SAS96
NLSY97 interviewers were instructed to show the respondents a card with the school-to-work
programs and their definitions. The interviewers then asked “Here is a list of some of the kinds of
programs schools offer to help students prepare for the world of work. Have you ever participated in
any of these programs through your school?”
The following is the list of programs and their definitions (listed in the order in which they were
asked):
•

Career major program, which is a defined sequence of courses based upon an occupational goal.

•

Job shadowing, which is to spend time following workers at a work site.

•

Mentoring, which involves being matched with an individual in an occupation.

The SAS96 is a paper questionnaire that was filled out by school administrators and mailed

back to the National Opinion Research Center. The specific school-to-work programs were asked
about in a grid style question with each column pertaining to a different program. The grid was
preceded by the following instructions and definition of terms: The questions on the following pages
are about work-based and career-oriented activities offered at your school. Please refer to the
glossary below for definitions of activities and terms referenced in this section.

17

•

Apprenticeship: Typically, multi-year programs that combine school- and work-based learning
in specific occupational areas or occupational clusters and are designed to lead directly into
either a related post-secondary program, entry-level job, or registered apprenticeship program.
May or may not include paid work experiences.

•

Career major: A coherent sequence of courses based upon an occupational goal.

•

Cooperative education: A method of instruction whereby students alternate or parallel their
academic and vocational studies with a job in a related field. May or may not include paid work
experiences.

•

Internship: For a specified period of time, students work for an employer to learn about a
particular industry or occupation. Students' workplace activities may include special projects, a
sample of tasks from different jobs, or tasks from a single occupation. May or may not include
paid work experiences.

•

Job shadowing: Typically as part of career exploration activities in early high school, a student
follows an employee for one or more days to learn about a particular occupation or industry. Job
shadowing is intended to help students hone their career objectives and select a career major for
the latter part of high school.

• Mentoring: Pairing a student with an employee over an extended period of time during which the
employee helps the student master certain skills and knowledge the employee possesses, models
workplace behavior, challenges the student to perform well, and assesses the student's
performance. Mentoring may be combined with other work-based learning activities, such as
internships or on-the-job training.
•

School-sponsored enterprise: The production of goods or services by students for sale to or use
by others. School-sponsored enterprises typically involve students in the management of the
project. Enterprises may be undertaken on or off the school site.

•

Tech prep: A planned program of study with a defined career focus that links secondary and
post-secondary education.

The Act called for approximately $300 million dollars to be appropriated for fiscal year
1995, with equal amounts being available for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. Federal
funding for school-to-work programs is to end in 2001.

Concise definitions of these three components were not provided in the Act. The
definitions that follow were developed by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., an
organization that has been involved in a large scale study to evaluate school-to-work
grants. See The First National Survey of Local School-to-Work Partnerships: Data
Summary, August 1997.

The NLSY97 is an annual survey that will interview youths while they make their
transition from school to the workforce. However, when we did this analyses, data were
available from only one interview with these youths, and most of the youths were still
attending school. Nonetheless, for results of the effects of school-to-work programs on
early youth outcomes see David Neumark and Mary Joyce, “Evaluating School-To-Work
Programs Using the New NLSY,” 2000.

PSUs are geographical constructs comprised of either a metropolitan area or a county.

Throughout this paper, all estimates of means, proportions, and percentages are sampleweighted. The logistic regression estimates are not weighted.

“Title I” is short for “Part A of Title I of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994,
Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.” Title I is the
largest federal aid program for our nation's schools and is aimed at providing educational
services to children who are the furthest from meeting the standards the state has set for all
children

Actually, 4,489 were asked these questions but 5 of them had missing or ambiguous
information on the current grade that they were attending so they were dropped from the
analysis.
9
Clearly we will be able to examine this using later waves of the survey.
10
As mentioned above, a non-response to the question on whether the school offered a
particular program was treated as a “no” response. To the extent that this is not the case,
the percent of schools estimated to have these programs will be underestimated.
11
That is, we conducted a statistical test that incorporated the standard error associated
with each estimate and found that the hypothesis that the two estimates are equal could be
rejected at the 5-percent significance level.
