    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper contributes a broad overview of the Canadian long-term care system. Taking an economist\u2019s viewpoint, we bring together supply and demand factors to provide an economic analysis of the current and future path for long-term care. Like other OECD countries, the coming demographic wave of older baby boomers will put tremendous stress on the existing financial, organizational, and physical structures of the long-term care system. Unlike other OECD countries, Canada\u2019s system is organized almost entirely at the subnational level, with provinces and territories having by far the largest role in financing and regulating long-term care. We provide institutional and empirical details on the evolution and future of Canada's long-term care system.\n\n",
