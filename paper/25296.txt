The Mandarin Model of Growth
Wei Xiong
NBER Working Paper No. 25296
November 2018
JEL No. E02,G18
ABSTRACT
China's economic reforms over the past 40 years have led to a mixed economic structure with the
government playing a key role in an increasingly market-driven economy. This paper expands a
standard growth model of Barro (1990) to incorporate this structure, with a particular focus on
including the agency problem between the central and local governments. To incentivize local
governors, the central government has established an economic tournament, which generates not
only intended incentives to develop local economies, à la Holmstrolm (1982), but also shorttermist behaviors, à la Stein (1989). The latter channel helps to explain a series of challenges that
confront the Chinese economy, such as overleverage through shadow banking and unreliable
economic statistics.

With the emergence of China as the second-largest economy in the world, there are growing demands for economists and policy makers to evaluate economic and …nancial risks in
the Chinese economy and their potential impacts on the rest of the world. However, the economic profession is yet to develop a systematic framework that accounts for China’s unique
economic structure— a mixed economy with the government playing a key role in an increasingly market-driven economy. As argued by a recent review in Song and Xiong (2018), the
risks and distortions originating from China’s government system are particularly important
for understanding a wide range of ongoing concerns about China’s …nancial stability. The
most serious concern is related to China’s leverage, measured by the ratio of its outstanding debt (excluding the central government debt) relative to GDP. It quickly rose above an
alarming level of 2.1 in 2015, with a substantial part of the rising leverage originating from
a booming shadow banking sector. As recognized by Bai, Hsieh and Song (2016) and Chen,
He and Liu (2017), this leverage boom was primarily driven by China’s local governments,
which only started to use debt …nancing from banks in 2008–2010 to implement China’s
massive post-crisis stimulus program. Even though the central government discouraged local governments from any further use of debt after the stimulus program ended in 2010,
local governments managed to use even more debt, albeit from the less transparent shadow
banking sector, to …nance their investment booms.
In this paper, I expand a standard macroeconomic model to incorporate the important
roles played by China’s government system. China has a complex government system with
the central government working along with regional governments at several levels: province,
city, county, and township. As emphasized by Xu (2011) and Qian (2017), regional governments are major players in China’s economic development. First, regional governments carry
out over 70% of …scal spending in China, and they are responsible for developing economic
institutions and infrastructure at the regional levels, such as opening up new markets and
constructing roads, highways, and airports. Second, despite their autonomy in economic and
…scal issues, regional government leaders are appointed by the central government, rather
than being elected by the local electorate. As a key mechanism to incentivize regional leaders,
the central government has established a tournament among o¢ cials across regions at the
same level, promoting those achieving fast economic growth and penalizing those with poor
performance. This system of …scal federalism greatly stimulated China’s economic growth
1

by giving local o¢ cials both …scal budgets and career incentives to develop local economies.
Speci…cally, I expand the growth model of Barro (1990) to incorporate this institutional
structure of China’s government system. I describe the basic model setting in Section 1. The
model considers an open economy with a number of regions. In each region, the representative
…rm has a Cobb-Douglas production function with three factors: labor, capital, and local
infrastructure. The …rm hires labor from local households at a competitive wage and rents
capital at a given interest rate from an open capital market. By creating more infrastructure
in the region, the local government can boost the productivity of the local …rm. Thus,
the local government faces a tradeo¤ in allocating its …scal budget, which is a …xed share
of local output, into investment on local infrastructure and consumption by government
employees. As the local government does not internalize household consumption, it has a
tendency to underinvest in infrastructure relative to the …rst-best benchmark, in which a
social planner makes the infrastructure investment decision to maximize the social welfare
of not only government employees but also the households. This underinvestment problem
re‡ects a key agency problem between the central and local governments, which motivated
the central government to establish the economic tournament among regional governors.
I introduce the economic tournament in Section 2, which indeed helps to mitigate underinvestment in infrastructure. As the output from each region re‡ects the ability of its
governor and the aggregate economic shock to the country, the central government uses the
output from all regions at the end of each period to jointly assess the ability and determine
career advancement of all regional governors. As more investment on infrastructure improves
regional output, the tournament generates an implicit incentive for each governor to invest
in infrastructure through the “signal-jamming mechanism” coined by Holmstrolm (1982),
due to the inability of the central government to fully separate the contribution of a governor’s ability and infrastructure investment to the regional output. This incentive serves as
a powerful mechanism to drive China’s economic growth, as highlighted by the literature on
the Chinese economy, e.g., Li and Zhou (2005).
More interestingly, the powerful incentives induced by the tournament may also lead
local governments to engage in short-termist behaviors, which help to explain various challenges that currently confront the Chinese economy. First, despite its advanced information
technology, China still lacks reliable statistics about its economy. As discussed by Hor2

tacsu, Liang and Zhou (2017) and Bai et al. (2018), the sum of China’s provincial GDP has
been routinely higher than the national GDP by a substantial amount— around 5 percent—
since 2004. This enormous discrepancy cannot simply be attributed to measurement errors.
Instead, it is deeply rooted in the government bureaucracy, as regional governments can in‡uence local statistics bureaus, which report local economic statistics. In Section 3, I extend
the model to capture this phenomenon by making the central government reliant on regional
governors to report regional output, which is, in turn, used to evaluate their performance
and to determine the region’s tax transfer to the central government. Consequently, career concerns motivate each regional governor to overreport regional output, at the expense
of a higher tax transfer to the central government. This mechanism is similar in spirit to
overreporting of earnings by executives of publicly listed …rms, e.g., Stein (1989).
The tournament among regional governors also helps to explain the aforementioned rising
leverage across China. To address this issue, I further expand the model in Section 4 to allow
each regional government to use debt …nancing to expand its …scal budget. The regional
governor faces an intertemporal tradeo¤ in using more debt to …nance more infrastructure
investment. On one hand, by taking advantage of a high growth rate of regional productivity,
it bene…ts the households (a social motive) and boosts his personal career (a private motive).
On the other hand, it requires a higher debt payment in the next period. While a certain
level of debt is socially bene…cial when the local productivity growth rate is su¢ ciently high,
my model also shows that a governor’s career concerns can lead to overinvestment by using
excessive leverage.
My model also o¤ers an intricate mechanism of spillover of excessive leverage from one
region to other regions. Under the assumption of rational expectations, the central government is able to fully anticipate short-termist behaviors of each regional government, such
as output overreporting and excessive use of leverage, and thus insulate the relative performance evaluations of other governors from such behaviors. This assumption is unrealistic
under China’s institutional environment, in which frequent policy innovations and …nancial
innovations give local governments ample ‡exibility out of sight of the central government. A
more realistic assumption is that the central government can only realize local governments’
short-termist behaviors with a delay, as consistent with China’s gradualistic approach to
economic reform. I incorporate this more realistic feature in Section 5. As a result, the
3

short-termist behavior of one governor adversely a¤ects the relative performance evaluation
of other governors, which, in turn, leads to a rat race between the governors in pursuing even
higher levels of leverage in their regions.
Overall, this “Mandarin” model is de…ned by two key features of the Chinese economy.
First, the government takes a central role in driving the economy through its active investment in infrastructure, which can be interpreted more broadly as measures and policies by
the government to support and stimulate economic development. Second, agency problems
in the government system can lead to a rich set of phenomena in the Chinese economy— not
only rapid economic growth propelled by the tournament among local governors, but also
short-termist behaviors of local governors that directly a¤ect China’s economic and …nancial
stability.
In Section 6, I also provide two stylized facts that support the key notions of the Mandarin
model. First, based on data reported by the national audit of local government leverage by
the Ministry of Finance, I …nd that across di¤erent provinces, there is a negative relationship
between local government leverage and return to capital. This negative relationship supports
the basic notion of our model that career concerns lead local governors to overinvest by using
excessive leverage. Second, by using the estimates of provincial GDP overreporting provided
by Bai et al. (2018), I show that across provinces, there is a positive relationship between
GDP overreporting and local government leverage, which supports another key notion of
my model that career concerns lead local governors to pursue both GDP overreporting and
excessive leverage.
My work builds on the literature that studies China’s institutional reform. Lau, Qian and
Roland (2000) analyze the optimality of the dual-track reform approach adopted by China
in allowing private …rms to coexist and compete with state …rms. The work of Maskin, Qian
and Xu (2000) is particularly close to mine as it justi…es the e¤ectiveness of the tournament competition in motivating local o¢ cials. There is also substantial empirical evidence
showing that local economic performance, such as GDP growth, is signi…cantly correlated
with the career incentives of local o¢ cials, e.g., Li and Zhou (2005) and Yu, Zhou and Zhu
(2016). Building on these theoretical and empirical results, my model embeds China’s institutional system into a macroeconomic framework and further highlights various short-termist
behaviors induced by local o¢ cials’career concerns and tournament competition.
4

This unique focus also di¤erentiates my model from other work analyzing China’s macroeconomy. Brandt and Zhu (2000) highlight the government’s commitment to support employment in ine¢ cient state …rms through money creation as a key driver of in‡ationary
pressure in China. Song, Storesletten and Zilibotti (2011) develop a macroeconomic model
for how …nancial frictions cause banks to favor state …rms and discriminate against more
e¢ cient private …rms, leading to a puzzling observation of a fast-growing country exporting
capital to other countries. Li, Liu and Wang (2015) develop a general equilibrium model to
show how state …rms, despite being less e¢ cient, managed to earn more pro…ts than private
…rms by monopolizing upstream industries and extracting rent from more liberalized downstream industries. Hsieh and Klenow (2010) measure misallocation of capital and labor in
China. Young (2003) and Zhu (2012) provide growth accounting of China. Hsieh and Song
(2015) analyze the transformation of state …rms during China’s economic reform. Cheremukhin et al. (2017) use a neoclassical two-sector growth model with wedges to analyze
growth in China’s pre-reform years in 1953–1978.
My paper also adds to the literature on the e¤ects of government spending on economic
growth, e.g., Barro (1990), Easterly and Rebelo (1993), and Glomm and Ravikumar (1994).
This literature is mostly agnostic about the institutional structure of the government system
that supports government spending and infrastructure development. In contrast, my model
highlights the tournament competition among regional governments in driving infrastructure
investment, as well as short-termist behaviors, which may eventually aggregate to substantial
macro e¤ects at the national level.

The Basic Setting

I consider an economy with M regions and in…nitely many periods t = 0; 1; 2::: I employ a
standard setting of Barro (1990) with infrastructure as public goods provided by the local
government in each region. In region i (i = 1; :::; M ), the local output is determined by the
production of a representative …rm:
Yit = Ait Kiti L1it

i

G1it

i

;

where Ait is the local productivity, Kit is the capital used for production, Lit is the local
labor input. The parameters

i

2 (0; 1) and 1

i

5

are the output shares of capital and labor,

respectively. In this section, I simply assume that the local productivity Ait in one region is
identically and independently distributed over time, without imposing any structure on the
productivities across regions. From the next section on, I will specify a particular structure
with a common productivity shock a¤ecting the productivities of all regions.
The third factor Git is infrastructure created by the local government. It serves as a public
good that boosts the local productivity. One may interpret Git as electricity, roads, bridges,
ports, and highways.1 As I will show, the …rm chooses capital and labor based on the level of
local infrastructure. Git thus serves as a direct channel for government investment to drive
the economy. After accounting for …rms’capital and labor choices, the regional economy
displays a constant return with respect to Git ; a feature that resembles the endogenous
growth model of Romer (1986).

1.1

Households and Firms

In any given region i, there are overlapping generations of households, as in Diamond (1965).
Each generation of households lives for two periods, and each individual born at t has
identical preferences represented by
t
ln(Citt ) + ln(Cit+1
);
t
represent consumption chosen by the individual across his lifetime at
where Citt and Cit+1

t and t + 1. The parameter

2 (0; 1) is the individual’s time discount rate for the next

period’s consumption. This OLG speci…cation with logarithmic utility simpli…es household
decisions, but is inconsequential to our key insight.
Each individual supplies one unit of labor when he is young, i.e., Lit = 1, at a competitive
wage and divides his wage income between consumption Citt and savings Sitt :
Citt + Sitt
where

it

is the competitive wage and

(1

)

it Lit ;

is the tax rate on both labor and capital income.

I adopt a small open economy setting for the region so that the savings are invested at the

Bai and Qian (2010) provide a detailed account of China’s development of infrastructure in three sectors: electricity, highways, and railways. Zhang and Barnett (2014) show that infrastructure investment
contributed to nearly 15% of China’s GDP in 2008–2012.

Throughout the paper, I consider the whole economy in the country as a small open economy
with the interest rate R being exogenously given by the global market.
The standard result for log utility implies that the individual consumes a …xed fraction
of his labor income in the current period and saves the rest for the next period:

I assume that …rms in the region are homogenous. In each period, the representative

where Wit is the competitive wage and R is the rental rate of capital, which is equal to the
interest rate. Note that I assume that tax is levied on labor and capital incomes rather than
on …rms.

wage is determined by the marginal product of labor:

By equating the marginal product of capital with the rental rate of capital, I can determine

The …rm’s optimal capital choice and output are both proportional to local infrastructure
Git ; which is developed by the local government. Thus, by developing local infrastructure,

the local government can directly stimulate …rms to expand their capital investment and raise
the labor wage. Furthermore, the production technology of the local economy is essentially
an AK technology with respect to infrastructure stock Git .

Local Government

I assume that the country adopts a system of …scal federalism. Speci…cally, the local government of each region collects tax and uses the tax revenue for developing local infrastructure
and funding its own consumption. For simplicity, this paper ignores the …scal spending of
the central government.
Tax is collected from labor and capital income at a rate of : Thus, the local government’s
tax revenue in period t is

(

it Lit

+ RKit ) = Yit ; which contributes to its budget at the

end of period t:
Wit = Yit + (1
with

G

G ) Git ;

2 [0; 1] as the depreciation rate of infrastructure and (1

G ) Git

as the infrastruc-

ture stock after depreciation. As the government employs a large number of employees, a
fraction of this budget has to be spent for the bene…t of government employees. Thus, the
local governor needs to allocate the budget between infrastructure for the following period
Git+1 and consumption by government employees EitG > 0 in the current period:
Git+1 + EitG = Wit :

(4)

For simplicity, I ignore other types of government spending. Note that EitG bene…ts government employees, but does not directly serve the households. In contrast, the infrastructure
8

Git+1 serves the welfare of both government employees and households as it increases the
productivity of the local economy.
I assume that the local government aims to maximize the following Bellman equation:
V (Wit ) = max Et
G
Eit

ln EitG + V (Wit+1 ) ;

(5)

subject to the budget constraint in (4). In this speci…cation, the government only maximizes
the private bene…t of government employees without caring about the welfare of the households. The government also has a log utility function for its private bene…t. The parameter
> 0 is redundant in this Bellman equation for the government choice, but serves to measure
the weight assigned to government employees in the …rst-best benchmark. The expectation
operation Et [ ] represents the conditional expectation at time t after the current-period productivity Ait and output Yit are observed. The value function V (Wit ) captures the welfare of
the government employees from period t onwards, with Wit as the state variable to capture
the local government’s current-period budget.
Note the following remarks on the setting: First, I allow the government to divest its
infrastructure without any cost, i.e., Git can be smaller than (1

G ) Git 1 .

Second, in this

section, I assume that the government cannot borrow or save and must spend its budget
in each period on either infrastructure investment or government consumption. I relax
this assumption in Sections 4 and 5 by allowing the government to use debt. Third, the
government’s investment decision at time t determines the level of infrastructure at t + 1.
This feature is realistic as infrastructure usually takes time to build.
As the governor is constrained from borrowing or saving, he faces an intertemporal tradeo¤ in allocating his current-period budget on either infrastructure investment or government
consumption. If he allocates more to infrastructure investment (i.e., a higher Git+1 ), the local
output and tax revenue in the next period are higher, trading o¤ less current-period government consumption. By directly solving the Bellman equation, Proposition 1 summarizes
the governor’s optimal investment rule.
Proposition 1 In each period, the local government allocates a …xed fraction
to local infrastructure:
Git+1 =

[ Yit + (1
9

G ) Git ] :

of its budget

This simple setting captures a mixed economic structure— the local government drives
the regional economy by building up local infrastructure, while local …rms make capital and
labor choices in response to the government’s infrastructure investment. Thus, by investing
more into local infrastructure, the local government can stimulate more investments from
local …rms. One may broadly interpret infrastructure in this model as including not only
physical infrastructure, such as roads and ports, but also intangible infrastructure such as
policies and systems that local governments develop to improve the local economic and
business environment.

1.3

The First-Best Benchmark

Given the local government’s self interest in spending the tax revenue, its infrastructure
choice does not consider the welfare of the households and thus is not socially optimal. For
comparison, I now analyze the …rst-best benchmark. Speci…cally, I consider a social planner,
who aims to maximize the welfare of the households in addition to that of the government
employees. In each period, I let the social planner, rather than the local government, make
the infrastructure decision. Then, given the infrastructure level, the representative …rm
makes its capital and labor choices, as in the main setting. That is, at time t; the …rm
chooses its capital after observing the local government’s infrastructure choice Git and the
local productivity Ait as given in (2), and o¤ers a competitive wage, as given in (1), so that
Lit = 1: Consequently, the output is given by (3).
The social planner allocates the aggregate social budget in the local economy
Witplanner = Yit + (1

G ) Git

to the young generation consumption Citt , to the old generation consumption Citt 1 , to the
government consumption EitG , and to infrastructure Git+1 :
Witplanner = Citt + Citt 1 + EitG + Git+1

As mentioned earlier, the parameter

10

The following proposition states the result from solving the planner’s Bellman equation:
Proposition 2 In the …rst-best benchmark, the social planner allocates a …xed fraction

of

the aggregate social budget to infrastructure:
Git+1 =

[Yit + (1

) Git ] :

A comparison of Propositions 1 and 2 shows that the local government underinvests in
infrastructure relative to the …rst-best level. This is because the local government does
not internalize the consumption of the households in its infrastructure choice. As a result,
it allocates only a …xed fraction

of its …scal budget to infrastructure. In contrast, the

social planner allocates a fraction

of the social budget to infrastructure. This underinvest-

ment reveals a fundamental agency problem between the central and local governments, and
motivates the central government to use the economic tournament to mitigate the agency
problem.

Career Concerns

Di¤erent from the typical federal government system in other countries, regional governors
in China are appointed by the central government rather than elected by a local electorate.
As eloquently summarized by Xu (2011) and Qian (2017), by giving local governments
large …scal independence and evaluating them based on a common set of criteria that weigh
heavily on local economic performance, regional governors are greatly incentivized to become
helping hands, rather than grabbing hands, in developing local economies. This economic
tournament is widely recognized as a key mechanism contributing to China’s rapid growth
over the past 40 years.
In typical western countries, career concerns of politicians who aim to win local elections
may also generate incentives to develop local economies. Such incentives vary across regions
depending on the preferences and interests of local electorates. For example, voters in one
region may care more about economic growth, thus leading to greater incentives for the local
politicians to develop local economy, while voters in another region may care more about the
environment, leading the local politicians to give lower priority to developing the economy.
Having the central government as the common evaluator of all regional governors in China
11

dictates that they all share the same career incentives and thus compete directly with each
other.
To incorporate the tournament, I adopt the following speci…cation of the productivity of
region i:
Ait = eft +ait +"it ;
where ft

N f;

2
f

represents a countrywide common shock with Gaussian distribution
2
f,

of mean f and variance

ait

N (ai ;

2
a)

represents the governor’s ability in developing

the local economy, which has Gaussian distribution of mean ai and variance
N (0;

2
")

2
a;

and "it

is an idiosyncratic noise component, again with Gaussian distribution of mean 0

and variance

2
".

These components are independent of each other, and neither of them is

publicly observable. Furthermore, their distributions are common knowledge to all agents.
I assume that a new governor, randomly drawn from the distribution N (ai ;

2
a ),

is as-

signed to a region in each period. The governor works in the region for only one period and
is concerned about the central government’s perception of his ability after observing his performance and his peers’performance. Speci…cally, suppose that a governor takes over region
i at the end of period t after Yit is realized, and chooses EitG and Git+1 . As the governor’s
ability a¤ects the local productivity at t + 1, the local output Yit+1 provides useful information about his ability when his term ends at t + 1. That is, his performance is determined
by

h
i
b
ait+1 = E ait+1 j fYit+1 gi=1;:::;M :

By substituting in Yit+1 from (3), I obtain
yit+1 = ln (Yit+1 ) = ln

(7)

Equation (7) shows that the local output ln (Yit+1 ) provides a useful signal about the governor’s ability ait+1 . As the governor can boost the local output by taking on more infrastructure investment, the governor’s career concerns give an incentive to invest more in
infrastructure, overcoming his preference for more government consumption. The career
concerns thus provide an implicit incentive to invest in local infrastructure, as in the spirit
of Holmstrolm (1982) and Gibbons and Murphy (1992).
12

To analyze this mechanism, I assume that the central government cannot observe the
stock of local infrastructure (i.e., Git+1 ) and other input in local production. Instead, it
observes only the output level Yit+1 . This assumption is realistic for several reasons. First, the
central government has to rely on local statistics bureaus to report local statistics. As local
governments have strong in‡uences on local statistics bureaus, they have ample ‡exibility
to manage or even distort local statistics. Second, the National Bureau of Statistics devotes
a great deal of e¤ort to auditing and verifying regional output, as it is a key variable for
many policy decisions of the central government. As a result, it is harder to distort output
statistics than other factor statistics. Motivated by these observations, I assume for the
rest of the paper that the central government can only use regional output to evaluate the
performance of local governors. Note that I will further modify the setting to allow local
governors to overreport regional output in Section 3, even though it is not manipulatable in
other sections.
Following Holmstrolm (1982), I assume that the central government has rational expectations and anticipates the local governor will choose a level of infrastructure Git+1 , which
is equal to its equilibrium level Git+1 . As a result, in interpreting the observed output, the
central government would simply deduct ln Git+1 from the observed log output yit+1 ; even
though it does not directly observe the governor’s actual choice Git+1 ; by constructing the
following su¢ cient statistic:
zit+1

(1

= ft+1 + ait+1 + "it+1 + (1

ln
i

i

+ ln Git+1
R
ln Git+1

:

(8)

From the central government’s perspective, the governor would choose Git+1 = Git+1 , and
consequently
zit+1 = ft+1 + ait+1 + "it+1 :

(9)

In Section 5, I will relax the rational expectations assumption to consider a more realistic
setting in which the central government can only realize the infrastructure and debt choices
of local governments with a delay.
Due to the common shock in each region’s productivity, the central government will use
the outputs from all regions to jointly infer each governor’s ability. This joint evaluation
leads to a tournament in which each governor’s performance is compared with that of other
13

governors. By directly applying the Bayes Theorem based on the composition of zit+1 given
in (9), I obtain the following learning rule for the central government:

This expression shows that choosing a higher Git+1 a¤ects the central government’s perception, even though the central government rationally anticipates such behavior in equilibrium, as re‡ected by its anticipation of Git+1 = Git+1 . This is the basic insight of the
signal-jamming mechanism highlighted by Holmstrolm (1982).
To capture the governor’s career concern induced by the tournament, I introduce an
additional term into the local government’s Bellman equation previously speci…ed in (5):

> 0 as the weight assigned to the governor’s

career concerns.2 In formulating this Bellman equation, I implicitly assume that while the
governor changes in each period, other employees of the local government will remain. As
these government employees care about their future consumption, they will ensure that the

One may micro-found this term by assuming that the central government randomly pairs each governor
with another governor and promotes the one with better perception. Linearizing the expected promotion
probability leads to the linear term speci…ed in the objective.

governor’s infrastructure choice accounts for their future welfare, as re‡ected by the last
term in the Bellman equation.
With the additional career concern term, the relevant terms in the governor’s objective
for choosing Git+1 on the right-hand side of the Bellman equation (11) are

Proposition 3 The governor’s career concerns lead to greater infrastructure investment:

Proposition 3 shows that career concerns motivate the governor to choose a greater level of
infrastructure investment. In particular, a governor with a higher

i

coe¢ cient invests more

into infrastructure. Thus, the tournament helps to overcome the underinvestment problem
to infrastructure, as derived in Proposition 1 for the case in which the local government only
cares about government consumption. This simple result provides the institutional foundation for China’s rapid growth, which builds on strong career incentives for local governors
to develop local economies.
Career concerns not only lead to positive incentives of developing local infrastructure but
also to other short-termist behaviors. In the subsequent sections, I analyze such short-termist
behaviors.

Output Overreporting

China has a multi-level structure for reporting economic statistics. The National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) reports national statistics, while local statistics bureaus, which are subject
to strong in‡uence from local governments, report local statistics. Hortaçsu, Liang and
15

Zhou (2017) and Bai et al. (2018) report that the sum of provincial GDP has been routinely
higher than the national GDP by an amout in the order of …ve percent of national GDP.
This substantial gap suggests that local statistics bureaus in aggregate overreport provincial
GDP. Furthermore, Bai et al. (2018) provide forensic analysis of overreporting of provincial
GDP and capital investment.
In this section, I analyze overreporting of regional output induced by the career concerns
of local governors. To examine this issue, I modify the model setting by assuming that
the central government does not directly observe the regional output in the current period.
Instead, each governor reports the output of his region to the central government. This
gives each governor the ‡exibility to in‡ate his performance. To discipline overreporting,
the central government takes away a fraction of the reported output as tax revenue to fund
central government spending. This assumption is consistent with the split tax arrangement
between the central government and local governments in China. Thus, from the perspective
of a regional governor, overreporting the local output comes at the cost of a larger tax transfer
to the central government.3
Speci…cally, I assume that a governor is free to report Yit0 as the output of his region,
which may be di¤erent from the actual output Yit . Or equivalently, the governor may choose
to report the log output yit0 , which is di¤erent from the actual log output yit by an amount
'it :
yit0 = yit + 'it :
With the actual output given by (7), the reported output is
yit0 =

In interpreting the reported output, the central government anticipates the governor will
invest Git in infrastructure and overreport by 'it and thus constructs the following su¢ cient
3

In 2017–2018, several provinces including Liaoning, Inner Mongolia and Tianjing publicly acknowledged
their overreporting in the previous years, partly due to large shortfalls in their …scal revenues, as GDP
over-reporting further reduced the tax revenues of these provinces. This feature is also consistent with the
…nding of Fan, Xiong and Zhou (2016) that during the Great Famine of China in 1959–1961, overreporting
of regional grain output by local governments led to greater procurement of grain to the central government
and more severe famine in the region.

'it+1 , even though the central government anticipates he

I further expand the tax system by assuming that the local government needs to transfer
part of its tax revenue to the central government at a rate of

c

<

based on the reported

0
output level Yit+1
. In other words, while the local government collects a tax of Yit+1 based

on the actual output, it has to transfer a greater fraction of the tax revenue to the central
government if it chooses to overreport the output. Then, the residual tax revenue for the
local government is

A higher overreporting 'it+1 thus reduces the local budget for the following period.

Et [ ln ((1

Git+1 ) +

i

(^
ait+1

where I reformulate the value function as a function of Git and Tit ; rather than a function
of the total budget Wit . This is because overreporting makes Wit insu¢ cient to capture the
state of the regional economy. The relevant terms in the governor’s objective for choosing
Git+1 and 'it+1 on the right-hand side of the Bellman equation are
max

Git+1 ; 'it+1

his career by overreporting the output, while the last term Et V Git+1 ; Yit+1 1

e'it+1

contains the cost of leaving a smaller …scal budget for the next period.
By solving this Bellman equation, the next proposition con…rms that the governor’s career
concern indeed leads to overreporting of the local output, and such overreporting increases
with his career incentive

i

and decreases with the central government tax rate

c.

Proposition 4 The governor’s output overreporting is given by the following equation:

which has a unique root between 0 and ln ( = c ) under the conditions (21) and (22) listed in

This mechanism for regional governors to overreport output is similar in spirit to that
for earnings manipulation by publicly listed …rms, e.g., Stein (1989). As …rm managers
have incentives to boost their stock prices, the signal jamming mechanism causes them to
overreport …rm earnings, despite that investors rationally anticipate such overreporting and
deduct it from stock valuation. By con…rming this mechanism, Proposition 4 suggests that
the lack of reliable economic statistics in China may not be random noise and instead could
be a systematic problem associated with China’s government bureaucracy.

Excessive Leverage

So far I have restricted regional governments from using any debt to leverage their …scal
budgets. This assumption is realistic for China in the period before 2008, as the central
government had strict rules against subnational governments’raising debt without its explicit
approval. However, the situation changed substantially after 2008, when the global …nancial
crisis prompted China to implement a massive economic stimulus of four trillion RMB. As
the stimulus was mostly …nanced by …scal budgets of local governments (rather than that
of the central government), and the stimulus required much more …nancing than what local
governments could a¤ord, the central government allowed local governments to establish the
“local government …nancing vehicle”(LGFV), which used explicit or implicit guarantees from
local governments to obtain bank loans to fund the stimulus projects, e.g., Bai, Hsieh and
Song (2016). After the stimulus program ended in 2010, the central government instructed
banks to discontinue lending to local governments. Facing pressure to roll over their maturing
loans, local governments moved their debt …nancing into shadow banking, as analyzed in
detail by Chen, He and Liu (2017), leading to even higher leverage. Zhang and Barnett
(2014) provide an estimate that debt …nancing (in the forms of both bank loans and shadow
banking debt) contributed to about two-thirds of infrastructure investment in China in 2008–
2012.
Debt gives a governor a greater capacity to invest in local infrastructure and thus may
exacerbate his short-termist behavior induced by career concerns. To address this issue, I
further extend the model setting. Speci…cally, I anchor on the setting from Section 2 (without
output overreporting and tax transfer to the central government), and allow each regional
government to use debt to …nance its infrastructure investment and spending. Speci…cally,
I assume that it can issue debt at a constant interest rate R: Then, its budget in period t
is its tax revenue from the previous period Yit plus the stock of infrastructure (1

G ) Git

minus its debt due RDit 1 :
Wit = Yit + (1

G ) Git

RDit 1 :

The governor can take new debt Dt , in addition to Wit ; to fund the next-period infrastructure
Git+1 and government consumption EitG :
Git+1 + EitG = Wit + Dit :
19

I keep the Bellman equation in (11) but give the governor the additional debt choice in each
period:
V (Wit ) =

ln Git+1

+ Et [V ( Yit+1 + (1

G ) Git+1

RDit )] :

It shall be clear that Wit is su¢ cient to capture the state of the regional economy at time t;
despite the use of debt. To facilitate our analysis, I scale the local government’s infrastructure
in each period by its budget:
git+1 =

Git+1
;
Wit

and debt level by its infrastructure level:
dit =

Dit
:
Git+1

dit can be directly interpreted as the fraction of infrastructure …nanced by debt. As I formally
derive in the Appendix, debt allows the governor to take on a higher level of infrastructure
relative to its current-period budget:
git+1 =

+
+

1

i
i

(1

dit )

:

A certain level of debt is socially bene…cial as it allows the regional government to expand
its budget to fully take advantage of high productivity in the current period. However, the
governor’s career concerns may induce excessive use of debt to …nance overinvestment at
the expense of a higher debt payment and thus a smaller budget in the next period. To
systematically examine this issue, I also examine the debt choice of a social planner who
aims to maximize the welfare of both the government and the households. Following the
setting in Section 1.3, the planner’s budget at time t is
Witplanner = Yit + (1

G ) Git

RDit 1 ;

which also includes repayment of the local government debt from the previous period. The
planner can also use new debt to boost its current period budget:
Citt + Citt 1 + EitG + Git+1 = Witplanner + Dit
20

to …nance infrastucture investment Git+1 , together with the consumption of the two generations of households Citt and Citt

1

and the government consumption EitG : Then, the planner’s

Bellman equation is given by
V Witplanner =

Et ln Citt + ln(Citt 1 ) + ln EitG + V Wit+1

(14)

I directly solve the Bellman equation of both the governor in (13) and the planner in
(14). Interestingly, their debt choices are determined by a maximization problem with the
same structure except di¤erent coe¢ cients, as summarized in the following proposition:
Proposition 5 Both the governor and the social planner would choose a debt level of dit =
Dit =Git+1 in the interval [0; (1

there is an interior debt choice. Furthermore, the governor’s debt choice is always higher than
the planner’s and the governor’s debt choice is increasing with his career incentive parameter
i.

This proposition shows that career concerns indeed lead the governor to take on excessive
debt, i.e., a debt level higher than the level chosen by the social planner. In choosing the
debt level, both the governor and the planner face the same intertemporal tradeo¤— a higher
debt level boosts the current period’s output, as re‡ected by the …rst term in (15), at the
expense of a higher debt payment in the following period, as re‡ected by the second term in
(15). The career concern causes the government to assign a greater weight to the …rst term,
leading to a higher debt choice.
To further illustrate the governor’s debt choice, Figure 1 depicts the debt choices of the
governor and the planner under a set of baseline parameter values:

Leverage Spillover

Policy innovations and …nancial innovations can complicate the agency problem between the
central and local governments. In this section, I analyze a novel channel through which
innovations can cause short-termist leverage choices by one governor to spill over to other
governors.
The discussion of local governors’career concerns so far builds on the premise that the
central government fully anticipates each regional governor’s short-termist behaviors (such as
overreporting and excessive leverage) with rational expectations and, consequently, is able

22

to perfectly …lter the e¤ect of any short-termist behavior of one governor on the relative
performance evaluation of other governors. This means that short-termist behaviors do not
spread across governors. Innovations may prevent the central government from fully anticipating the short-termist behaviors of local governments. First, as part of the key gradualistic
approach adopted by China to reform its economy over the past 40 years, the central government encouraged local o¢ cials to experiment with policy reforms and innovations at the
regional level and also encouraged local o¢ cials to follow and imitate promising policy initiatives of other regions. When a new policy initiative emerges, the central government often
takes a passive mode of simply observing its e¤ects before eventually determining whether
to endorse or terminate it. Xu (2011) gives an extensive review of this reform approach
and argues that it has played an important role in China’s institutional development. This
reform approach implies that the central government is, by design, slow to catch up with the
policy innovations of local governments.
Second, …nancial innovations further complicate the central government’s learn process
of new strategies or new games created by local governments. This is because …nancial
innovations provide new instruments and new arrangements for local governments to strategically hide or reveal part of their …nancial transactions and …scal conditions to the central
government. For example, various shadow banking products, such as wealth management
products, allow banks to move regular bank loans made to local government …nancing vehicles o¤ their own balance sheets. By doing so, banks are able to make at least some of these
loans o¤ the radar of the central government. While it is easy for the central government to
anticipate the incentives of local governments to pursue short-termist behaviors, the lack of
transparent statistics makes it di¢ cult for the central government to …gure out the speci…c
form and magnitude of such behaviors, when they are hidden behind complicated …nancial
arrangements.
If the central government does not fully anticipate the debt and investment levels taken by
each local government, the tournament between the regional governors may take a di¤erent
form because short-termist behaviors by one governor can also motivate other governors to
pursue short-termist strategies, which in turn may feed back to the initial governor, leading
to a rat race among the governors. To formally address this issue, I suppose that the central
government faces a delay in updating its anticipation of each local governor’s investment:
23

Git = Git 1 , which is similar in nature to adaptive expectations.4 Following the central
government’s learning of governor i in (10),

An immediate consequence of the central government’s adaptive expectations is that each
local governor’s career concerns are no longer immune from the investment and leverage
choices of other governors, as re‡ected by the summation term involving Gjt in this formula.
In practice, the central government often directly compares the performance of a governor
with another governor in a region with similar economic conditions. Building on the linear
career incentive speci…ed in (13), I also add another quadratic term to the governor’s career
incentive:
V (Wit ) =

max Et

Git+1 ; Dit

ln (EitG ) +

i

(^
ait+1

a
^i0 t+1 )

i

(^
ait+1

a
^i0 t+1 )2 + V (Wit+1 ) ;
(16)

where i0 is another governor paired with i: This quadratic term gives an increasing incentive
for governor i to catch up with the other governor. As there are a large number of other
governors, I suppose that i0 is chosen to have the same economic conditions: Gi0 t = Git and
Wi0 t = Wit . This pairing allows me to maintain simplicity of the derivation without any loss
of generality. I also make the setting symmetric so that ai = aj = a and

i

=

j

= . Then,

it follows that
a

^i0 t+1 = ( +

Consequently,
Et [

i

(^

^i0 t+1 )] =

i

( +

0

) (1

) (ln Git+1

ln Gi0 t+1 ) ;

The speci…c form of how Git is updated is not particularly important. As long as it is delayed and
Git 6= Git , the investment and leverage choices of one governor would interfere the relative performance
evaluation of other governors.

These two terms reveal that governor i’s career concerns are a¤ected not only by his own

I again rescale each governor’s two choice variables as

The following proposition summarizes the equilibrium between the two paired governors’
choices.
Proposition 6 Given the investment choice gi0 t+1 of governor i0 , the investment choice git+1

which implies git+1 as an increasing function of gi0 t+1 and dit . Governor i’s leverage choice

which determines dit = di (gi0 t+1 ) ; and thus governor i’s investment response to governor i0
is
git+1 = gi (gi0 t+1 ) :

(17)

Similarly, governor i0 ’s investment choice gi0 t+1 is an increasing function of git+1 and di0 t ,
and leverage choice is a function di0 t = di0 (git+1 ) ; which in turn determines governor i0 ’s
investment response to governor i:
gi0 t+1 = gi0 (git+1 ):

(18)

Equations (17) and (18) jointly determine the equilibrium choices of the two governors.

Figure 2: Equilibrium Debt and Investment Choices
Proposition 6 shows that the two governors’investment and debt choices are entangled.
To illustrate their interactions, I use a numerical example based on the following parameter
values:
= 0:2;

= 1=3; R = 1:1;

f = a = 0:05;

f

= 1;

a

G

= 0:05;
"

= 0:9;

= 1;

= 0:5:

In addition, I choose the following incentive parameters for the two governors, denoted as 1
and 2:
1

=

2

= 2;

1

=

2

= 40:

Figure 2 illustrates the equilibrium. Because of the symmetric parameters chosen for the
two governors, they make symmetric investment and debt choices. The left panel depicts
each governor’s debt choice di as a function of the other governor’s investment choice gi0 .
When gi0 is small, di is zero. As gi0 rises, governor i chooses a higher leverage di to …nance
greater infrastructure investment in his region. The right panel depicts the two governors’
investment choices with respect to each other. The dashed line represents the best investment
response g2 of governor 2 to governor 1’s investment g1 , while the solid line represents the best

Figure 3: Rat-Race Dynamics
investment response g1 of governor 1 to governor 2’s investment g2 . Both of these investment
response functions are increasing. The equlibrium lies at the intersection of these two lines.
To further highlight the interactions between the two governors’ investment choices, I
increase the incentive parameter

2

of governor 2 from the initial value of 2 to 3: Figure 3

illustrates the changes in the equilibrium by plotting the investment response curves of both
governors 1 and 2. Point a in the plot is the initial equilibrium with g1 = g2 = 3:77: As

2

rises from 2 to 3, governor 2 becomes more aggressive in his investment and debt choices,
and his best response curve, shown by the dashed line, moves up. If governor 1’s investment
choice g1 is kept at the initial value, governor 2’s investment choice will move up to point
b1 , which is accompanied by a corresponding increase in his debt choice not shown in the
…gure. However, with g2 increased, governor 1 would also respond to increase his investment
to a level given by point b2 , which in turn stimulates governor 2 to increase his investment
level further to b3 , and so on and so forth. This rat-race dynamic would eventually converge
and drive the equilibrium to point b, which has a substantially larger investment increase
for governor 2 than his initial increase if governor 1’s investment choice stays unchanged.
Through this rat race, the change in the career incentives of governor 2 also leads to a
substantial increase in the investment choice of governor 1:

Discussion

In this section, I summarize several stylized facts about local government leverage and GDP
overreporting across di¤erent provinces in China to show that they lend support to the
Mandarin model. A basic insight of the model is that career concerns lead local governors to
overinvest by using excessive leverage, which implies a negative correlation between return to
capital and local government leverage across regions. Furthermore, as career concerns lead
each local governor to not only use excessive leverage but also overreport regional output, one
would also expect a positive correlation between local government leverage and overreporting
of local output. I organize our discussions around these two key implications.
Local government leverage

As discussed earlier, the post-crisis stimulus led to a

leverage boom among local governments in China. Because local governments used LGFV
to raise debt from both banks and shadow banking, their debts were largely nontransparent
to the central government and the public. Based on the data released by the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) in 2015 (several years after the post-crisis stimulus program had ended) from
its national audit of the leverage of local governments, Figure 4 depicts the local government
debt-to-GDP ratio for all provinces (excluding Tibet due to its special economic status). The
average debt-to-GDP ratio is 27.5 percent. There is also substantial variation in this ratio,

28

Figure 5: Local government debt-to-GDP ratio versus return to capital
with some provinces in western China, such as Guizhou and Qinghai, having a leverage ratio
of over 50%.
Figure 5 provides a scatter plot of the local government debt-to-GDP ratio against each
province’s return to capital in 2015. The latter variable is from Bai et al. (2018), which o¤ers
systematic adjustments of potential misreporting in China’s provincial statistics. Consistent
with the common impression, this …gure shows that western provinces such as Ningxia and
Qinghai tend to have higher leverage and lower return to capital, while coastal provinces
such as Guangdong tend to have lower leverage and higher return to capital. Overall, local
government leverage is negatively correlated with return to capital with a t-statistic of 2.03.
This negative relationship supports the basic notion of our model that career concerns can
cause local governors to overinvest by using excessive leverage.
GDP overreporting Figure 6 depicts the gap between the sum of provincial GDP (reported by provincial statistics bureaus) and the national GDP (reported by the National
Bureau of Statistics) divided by the national GDP for each year in 2001–2016. Since 2004,
the sum of provincial GDP has been regularly higher than the national GDP by about 5
percent. One may argue that di¤erent provinces might have double-counted output made
by …rms with production across provincial borders. The …gure also shows the percentage
of provinces reporting a GDP growth rate higher than the national GDP growth rate. In
29

Figure 6: Provincial GDP over-reporting
a given year, over 80 percent of the provinces reported a GDP growth rate higher than the
national growth rate, except in 2006 and 2007. Taken together, Figure 6 reveals a compelling
pattern that provincial governments in China in aggregate overreport their GDP.5
Bai et al. (2018) provide an estimate of each province’s GDP overreporting for each year
after 2004. Speci…cally, they compare the sum of value-added of sectors as reported at the
provincial level with the same sectors at the national level. They …nd little discrepancy in
these two numbers for “above-scale” …rms, but large discrepancies for below-scale …rms as
well as sectors in which these numbers are based on local governments’administrative data.
They reestimate provincial GDP using alternative data sources, such as China Customs and
microdata from national value-added tax invoices. They assume that …nal consumption (at
both the national and provincial levels) and net exports (at the national level) are reliable.
They correct provincial GDP mainly through adjusting investment data.
Based on the provincial GDP overreporting estimated by Bai et al. (2018), Figure 7
provides a scatter plot of the ratio of provincial GDP overreporting to GDP and local government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2015. Interestingly, western provinces such as Guizhou and
5

Such over-reporting is not sustainable. In recent years, several provinces have publicly acknowledged
their GDP over-reporting in the past so that they can reset the GDP base for better performance in the
future years. In early 2017, provincial government of Jiaoning revealed in its annual report submitted to
its People’s Congress that it has systematically over-reported Liaoning’s economic statistics in 2011-2014.
In January 2018, the provincial governments of both Inner Mongolia and Tianjing also confessed that they
have also in‡ated their economic statistics in the previous years.

30

Figure 7: Provincial GDP over-reporting versus local government leverage
Qinghai again show both higher leverage and greater GDP overreporting. Overall, there is
an evident positive relationship between GDP overreporting and local government leverage
with a t-statistic of 5.4. This signi…cant relationship supports a key prediction of our model
that career concerns lead local governors to pursue excessive leverage and overreport local
output.

Conclusion

This paper develops the Mandarin model of growth to capture two key features of the Chinese
economy. First, the government takes a central role in driving the economy through its active
investment in infrastructure. Second, agency problems in the government system generate
a rich set of phenomena in the Chinese economy, including not only rapid economic growth
propelled by the tournament among local governors but also short-termist behaviors of local
governors, which directly a¤ect China’s economic and …nancial stability.

Thus, Git+1 = Witplanner : The infrastructure level is determined by

wealth, rather than the budget of the local government. This is because the social planner
also internalizes the welfare of the households in addition to that of the government.

These two equations jointly determine the two governors’debt choices and lead to rat-race
dynamics.
