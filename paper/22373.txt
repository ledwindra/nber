ABSTRACT
The minimum wage has increased in multiple states over the past three decades. We examine the
impact of the state minimum wage on infant health. Using data on the universe of births in the US
over 24 years, we find that an increase in the minimum wage is associated with an increase in
birth weight driven by increased gestational length and fetal growth rate. The effect size is
meaningful and plausible. We also find an increase in prenatal care use and a decline in smoking
during pregnancy, which are some channels through which minimum wage can affect infant
health.

1. Introduction
Changing the minimum wage is one of the most common ways that policymakers use to increase
income among low-skilled persons. It is also one of the most controversial. Recently, there has been
several relatively large increases in minimum wages. Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and
Washington DC all have $15 minimum wage laws on the books. These minimum wage rates are double
the current federal level minimum wage, and other states are contemplating similar increases. In 2014,
President Obama issued an executive order raising the minimum wage of federal contractors to $10.10.
The flurry of recent, legislative activity on the minimum wage and the size of recent minimum wage
increases have renewed, once again, the debate over the value of minimum wage statutes.
Proponents of increasing the minimum wage suggest that it would increase earnings and reduce
income inequalities. Opponents, however, argue that an increase in the minimum wage will raise
employers’ cost of labor, decrease employment and raise prices. The debate is fueled by the fairly mixed
evidence on the effects of the minimum wage on employment with some studies finding no significant
changes in employment, while others finding a modest decline (Congressional Budget Office 2014).
Findings related to earnings are more consistent and show that minimum wages raise wages for lowskilled workers.
Notably, potential effects of the minimum wage on non-labor market outcomes such as health are
not commonly considered in the debate, which is an oversight, as such effects are important for
understanding the full impact of minimum wage policies. Economic theory suggests that an increase in
the minimum wage may improve health among workers through an income effect. However, if a higher
minimum wage reduces employment for some individuals, this can result in an opposite effect for that
group. Effects of the minimum wage on health may be particularly relevant for infants because of the
short, but critical period of gestation that influences infant health. Increases in income around the time of
pregnancy can affect both maternal health, for example, because of better nutrition and less financial
stress, and their babies’ health, for example, because of greater amounts of prenatal care and improved
maternal health. Indeed, there is growing recognition that improving women’s health prior to conception
3

is key to decreasing rates and disparities in adverse birth outcomes (Atrash et al., 2008; Johnson et al.,
2006). Evidence from other income-enhancing policies including the earned income tax credit (EITC)
indicates a positive effect on infant health among poor mothers. Therefore, understanding how minimum
wage changes affect infant health is essential for understanding not only short-term consequences, but
also potentially long-run impacts on health given the importance of early life status for long-term
wellbeing.
We provide one of the first studies of the effects of minimum wages on infant health.
Specifically, we evaluate how state-level minimum wages affect birth weight, gestational age, and fetal
growth among births of low-educated women in the US between 1989 and 2012. We also examine two
potential mechanisms, prenatal care and maternal smoking, that plausibly link the minimum wage to birth
outcomes. We use data from birth certificates and a difference-in-differences research design to obtain
estimates of the effect of minimum wages on outcomes that are plausibly interpreted as causal.
Results from the study indicate that a $1 increase in the minimum wage during the two-years
prior to a birth increases birth weight significantly, but by a very small amount: approximately 4 grams
(0.1 percent) among low-educated mothers. However, this average effect masks heterogeneous effects
between demographic groups. Effect sizes are larger for younger and/or married mothers than for older
and/or unmarried mothers, but all estimates are still quite small relative to the mean. These small
estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on birth weight also imply small effects of a change in
earnings on birth weight. Our minimum wage estimates suggest that a $1000 change in annual earnings in
the two-years prior to birth is associated with an 8.5 gram (0.3 percent) increase in birth weight, which is
smaller than, but in the same general magnitude as estimates reported in a study of the effect of the EITC
on birth weight (Hoynes et al. 2015). Consistent with these beneficial effects of the minimum wage on
birth weight, we also find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage in the two-years prior to birth is
associated with significant, but very small improvements in other measures of infant health; a decline in
low-birth weight, an increase in fetal growth, and a decline in pre-term birth. In terms of mechanisms, we
find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage in the two-years prior to birth is associated with a
4

significant, but small (2 percent) increase in prenatal care and a small (5 percent) decrease in maternal
smoking.
2. Related Literature
2.a. Effects of Minimum Wages on Employment and Earnings
The effects of minimum wages on labor market outcomes has been an actively researched topic.
Findings, however, are not uniform. A number of studies find evidence that minimum wages have no
effect on employment (e.g., Addison, Blackburn, & Cotti, 2012; Dube, Lester, & Reich, 2010; Card &
Krueger, 1994). In contrast, others find evidence of a decrease in employment (Neumark, Salas, &
Wascher, 2014; Neumark & Wascher, 1992). The Congressional Budget Office (2014)
(https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995) summarized the literature and concluded that past evidence
suggests that an increase in the minimum wage will reduce employment slightly—an increase in federal
minimum wage to $10.10 from its current level of $7.25 would decrease employment by 0.3 percent.
While the evidence for effects of minimum wages on employment remains mixed, there is
consistent evidence suggesting that minimum wages increase earnings for workers. 1 Positive effects on
earnings have been reported in several studies for low-educated and low-income individuals and for both
males and females (Belman, Wolfson, & Nawakitphaitoon, 2015). The evidence of a positive effect of
the minimum wage on income is stronger for females for whom the majority of studies find positive
effects on earnings (weekly or hourly). Other research suggests that the increase in earnings among the
lowest wage workers, who are the ones most affected by increasing minimum wage rates may not
necessarily offset the potential decline in work hours or employment status, and that minimum wage
increases may have a net negative effect on average income for this group (Neumark, Schweitzer, &
Wascher, 2004). The CBO (2014) report, however, concluded that an increase in the minimum wage to
$10.10 would substantially increase wages for approximately 20 million workers and this increase in

(2007); Reich and Hall (2001).

income would greatly outweigh the loss in earnings associated with decreased employment. 2 Overall, the
evidence on the labor market effects of the minimum wage suggest that minimum wages will raise
income.
2.b. Effects of Minimum Wages on Health
The literature studying the effects of the minimum wage on health is sparse. Meltzer and Chen
(2011) examined the effect of the minimum wage on body mass index (BMI). They reported a negative
association; increases in the real minimum wage between 1968 and 2007 were associated with a decrease
in BMI. A paper by Horn, Maclean, and Strain (2017) that used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS) reported mixed evidence. For men, they found that minimum wages were
associated with an increase in self-reported fair/poor health, but a decline in the number of days with poor
mental health. For women, they found a marginally significant decline in number of days in poor mental
health and no other significant effects. McCarrier et al. (2011) also used the BRFSS and found that higher
minimum wages were associated with lower levels of unmet medical needs.
There is also some international evidence suggesting positive health benefits for workers. A
recent paper by Lenhart (2017a) studied the effects of the introduction of the national minimum wage in
the UK in 1999. Estimates indicated that the minimum wage was associated with improvements in selfrated health and reported health conditions, with reductions in financial stress and improved financial
well-being implicated as a potential pathway. Exploiting variation in the minimum wage within 24
OECD countries over time and within US states over time, Lenhart (2017b) also reported that higher
minimum wages was associated with improved population health.
There are two studies that we are aware of that study the association between minimum wages
and infant health. Strully, Rehkopf, and Xuan (2010), which focused on the effects of the EITC on birth
weight, also included the minimum wage in the regression analyses. These authors reported that that a $1

There is also some evidence that prices will rise, which will reduce real purchasing power: Aaronson (2001);
Basker and Khan (2013); Dube, Naidu, and Reich (2007); MacDonald and Aaronson (2006); MaCurdy (2015);
Powers (2009).

increase in the minimum wage was associated with a 3-gram increase in birth weight and 7% decline in
the odds of smoking. However, these results were not robust with estimates differing by time period (e.g.,
significant effect pre-1988 but not post-1998) and samples (excluding California, Indiana, Louisiana,
Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Washington). In addition, the significance of the
estimates is not clear because standard errors were calculated ignoring likely non-independence of
observations within states (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan, 2004). 3
The second study is by Komro et al. (2016). This study used data from vital statistics aggregated
to the month-state level and a difference-in-differences design to obtain estimates of the effect of the
minimum wage on low-birth weight and neonatal mortality. The sample included all births. Estimates
indicated that a $1 increase in minimum wage was associated with a 0.07 percentage point (7/100th of a
percentage point) decline in low-birth weight.
As the brief summary of the previous literature has shown, there is relatively little research on the
effects of the minimum wage on health. This is an important gap in knowledge because earnings
increases associated with the minimum wage are comparable to those from other policies that have been
more thoroughly studied. Indeed, studies on the EITC suggest that modest increases in income among
low-income families can improve children’s health. Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2015) reported that a
$1000 increase in net after-tax income, from expansions in the federal EITC, was associated with a 2% to
3% decline in low birth weight. They also find that this positive income effect from the EITC expansion
was associated with an increase in prenatal care use and a decline in maternal smoking, which are
potential mechanisms for the increase in birth weight. The EITC has also been shown to be correlated
with a decline in maternal smoking (Averett & Wang, 2013; Cowan & Tefft, 2012). Strully et al. (2010)
found that living in a state that has its own EITC was related to nearly a 15 gram increase in birth weight
and 5% decline in smoking odds using 1980-2002 natality data. The state EITC has also been linked to

The study also had other limitations. The regression model included several variables on the causal pathway
between minimum wage and infant health such as unemployment rate and poverty indicators.

improved overall child health rating later in childhood including ages 6 to 14 (Baughman & Duchovny,
2016). Positive effects on maternal health including self-reported health rating as well as biomarkers have
also been reported (Evans & Garthwaite, 2014), providing further evidence for a potential mechanism
through maternal health and health behaviors.
To summarize, we extend the literature on the effects of the minimum wage on health. We focus
on infant health because of the critical nature of the prenatal period, which is short and easily linked to the
potential income effects of the minimum wage. We use data spanning a 25-year period in which there was
substantial variation in minimum wages. We examine multiple infant health and maternal behavioral
outcomes, consider multiple measures of the minimum wage, and allow for cumulative effects of the
minimum wage effect. Furthermore, while focusing on low-educated mothers who are most likely to be
affected by the minimum wage, we examine several subgroups within this population by age, education,
race, and marital status.
3. Mechanisms Linking Minimum Wage and Infant Health
Conceptually, an increase in the minimum wage can improve infant health through a positive
income effect on maternal health and health behaviors that can have effects on fetal health. As noted
above, the majority of studies examining earnings report an increase in hourly or weekly wages following
a rise in the minimum wage, with larger effects among women than men (Belman et al., 2015;
Congressional Budget Office, 2014). Greater income from an increase in the minimum wage will increase
consumption and can have positive or negative effects on health, for example by improving nutrition or
increasing consumption of unhealthy goods such as alcohol. Greater income may also increase medical
care such as prenatal care services, particularly among those who are in low-paying jobs, likely to be
affected by the minimum wage and likely to be without health insurance. Finally, increased income may
increase financial security, which may reduce maternal stress, a factor linked to fetal growth (Camacho,
2008). There may be additional effects stemming from these changes, for example, greater financial
security, less stress and improved mental health may reduce health behaviors such as smoking that are
often used to treat stress (Byrne & Mazanov, 2016; Saffer & Dave, 2005).
8

On the other hand, the generally positive effects of the minimum wage through increased
earnings among workers may be offset by potential declines in employment. Two studies reported
employment declines when focusing on low-educated women (Pinoli, 2010; Sabia, 2008). If the
minimum wage affects employment, this may also lead to reallocation of time use due to the easing of
time constraints and an increase in non-work/leisure time. Greater availability of time, ceteris paribus,
may lead to an increase in time-intensive activities, including certain health-promoting behaviors such as
preparing healthy meals at home and exercising or obtaining preventive healthcare. However, given the
evidence of an increase in earnings relative to the decline in employment it is reasonable to hypothesize a
net positive income effect on infant health among low-income women.
An increase in the minimum wage may also reduce reliance on welfare programs such as food
stamps (SNAP). There is evidence of a decline in enrollment and expenditures on the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with increasing minimum wage rates (Reich & West, 2015).
However, there is no evidence for effects on other welfare program participation such as the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Medicaid enrollment, housing
assistance programs, and cash assistance programs including Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) and Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) (Sabia & Nguyen, 2015).
Finally, price effects related to the minimum wage may result in reduced consumption, some of
which may have adverse effects on maternal and infant health such as food consumption, grocery
shopping and housing improvement. However, evidence suggests very modest increases in prices with the
largest effects on restaurants (MaCurdy, 2015).
Overall, the evidence on the effects of the minimum wage on employment, earnings, participation
in social welfare programs and prices suggest that the minimum wage will have salutary effects on
maternal and infant health. This is because the dominant effect of the minimum wage is to raise incomes
of workers. There are small offsetting effects related to employment loss and higher prices, although
higher prices may reduce consumption of unhealthy goods as well as healthy products. Thus, we expect
that the minimum wage will be positively associated with infant health.

4. Research Design
Our empirical analysis is motivated by the mechanisms just described linking the minimum wage
to infant health. We estimate a reduced-form model that directly links the state-level minimum wage to
infant health outcomes. The research design is a difference-in-differences approach focusing on the
“intention-to-treat” effect of increasing the minimum wage. For each measure of infant health, we
estimate the following regression specification:
(1)

𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾𝑚𝑚 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛤𝛤 + 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝛹𝛹 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

In equation (1), H denotes a specific measure of infant health (e.g., birth weight) or maternal
behavior (e.g., prenatal care) for a given birth i occurring in state s, month m, and year t. MW is the
average minimum wage two years prior to delivery in the given state and birth month and year. We use a
two-year window prior to birth because the effects of the minimum wage may accumulate and may be
particularly important because of the growing recognition that preconception health of the mother, which
would be influenced by the minimum wage prior to birth, is an important determinant of infant health
(Atrash et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2006). Equation (1) includes time (year θ and month γ) and state fixed
effects (α). The vector X represents individual characteristics of the mother such as age, education, marital
status, and race/ethnicity; and Z represents a vector of time-varying, state-level factors matched to the
birth year. These capture concurrent policy shifts affecting low-educated mothers over the sample period,
which prior studies have linked to maternal behavioral health and/or infant health, most notably
expansions in the state’s earned income tax credit, expansions in Medicaid eligibility, welfare reform, and
cigarette taxes (Baughman, 2012; Corman et al., 2013; Currie & Gruber, 1996; Dave et al., 2008; Dave et
al., 2010; Evans & Garthwaite, 2014; Howell, 2001; Hoynes et al., 2015; Kaestner & Lee, 2005). 4

Expansions of the federal earned EITC were also underway over this period. Specifically, an EITC expansion that
passed in 1993 and became effective in tax year 1995 raised the maximum credit for all qualifying families and
further increased the differential in maximum benefits between families with two or more children relative to those
with only one child. In 2001, the income level at which the EITC began to phase out for couples was further
increased. These federal expansions, along with shifts in the national price level and other trends, are captured by the
year and month (θ and γ) fixed effects

10

In order to control for other time-varying, state-level unobservable variables, we also include the
state-year specific mean of the dependent variable for college-educated, married pregnant women
between the ages of 25-44. These women earn wages that make it likely that they would be unaffected by
minimum wage policies. Note that this does not amount to using college-educated married pregnant
women as a comparison group since we are not constraining the coefficient to be one (as would be the
case in a difference-in-difference-in-differences context). We include this variable to control for timevarying, state-specific changes in the outcomes proportionally affecting low- and higher-educated
mothers. However, we can assess whether this proportional effect is one-to-one, thereby assessing
whether the higher educated group is a valid control within a difference-in-difference-in-differences
(DDD) specification. Except for a subset of models for prenatal care and prenatal smoking, we generally
reject this restriction, and therefore do not utilize college-educated mothers as a direct comparison group.
The parameter of interest is δ, which captures the reduced-form effect of the increase in the
state’s effective minimum wage. This effect is identified from the substantial variation in the minimum
wage within states over this period (see Figure 1). As noted, we measure the minimum wage as the
average minimum wage in the two year period prior to delivery. In some analyses, we allow for separate
effects of the minimum wage effective during pregnancy and the minimum wage in the one- or two-year
period prior to conception. We think it appropriate to use a longer window than pregnancy to measure the
minimum wage because an increase in the minimum wage prior to pregnancy may affect maternal
preconception health, as well as allowing families to have more savings and smooth consumption during
pregnancy.
We estimate equation (1) for all low-educated women and for several demographic groups
defined by age, marital status and education because there may be heterogeneous responses and because
different demographic groups are more or less likely to be affected by the minimum wage. Table 1
provides some evidence as to which demographic groups may be more or less affected by the minimum
wage. In Table 1, we present the average number of what we refer to as “affected hours” for different
demographic groups of low-educated mothers. “Affected hours” are the number of annual hours of work
11

for a family that will be affected by an increase in the minimum wage. It is intended to measure the
annual change in family income from a $1 increase in the minimum wage and is a reasonable
approximation of exposure to the treatment, which is a change in the minimum wage. To calculate
“affected hours”, we estimate for each demographic subgroup the average annual work hours for families
of that subgroup (e.g. low-educated females aged 18-44 years) including all family members who work
and earn an hourly wage that is 1.25 times the minimum wage. 5 This yields an estimate of the change in
annual family income that is likely from a $1 increase in minimum wage. It assumes no employment
effects, which is reasonable given existing evidence (CBO 2014).
For the full sample of low-educated women, “affected hours” are 477, which implies that a $1
increase in minimum wage would increase annual family income by $477. We also show two alternative
measures that calculate affected hours using different rules about who is likely to be affected by the
minimum wage: those who earn 1.33 times the minimum wage and those who earn $1 above the
minimum wage. The “affected hours” using these alternatives are similar ($558 and $441, respectively).
Figures in the first row of Table 1, show that there is some heterogeneity in “exposure” but not that much.
Younger women and married women are more likely to be affected by an increase in the minimum wage
than older women and single women. This is because young women earn lower wages than older women
and married women are more likely to have spouses that may be affected. Thus, young married women
have the highest number of “affected hours” and older, single women have the lowest number of
“affected hours”, and the difference between the two groups represents a $380 difference in the change in
annual income from a $1 increase in the minimum wage. We note that we calculated “affected hours” as a
rough approximation to measure exposure to an increase in the minimum wage. Besides this differential
exposure to minimum wage, there may be heterogeneous responses in infant health and behavior

5
We use the Current Population Survey (CPS) outgoing rotation files to measure hourly wage and estimate average
weekly work hours across all family members earning less than 1.25 times the minimum wage. Then, we multiply
the weekly work hours by average annual work weeks from the CPS March files to measure annual “affected
hours”. For deriving average annual work weeks, we include all family members with implied hourly wage (based
on reported annual wage income and annual work hours) less than 1.25 times the minimum wage.

12

behaviors to income changes across demographic groups so it is not necessarily the case that we expect
effect sizes to align with exposure, as measured by “affected hours”.

5. Data
5.a. Natality Files
Our data come primarily from information on individual birth records from the Vital Statistics,
Natality Files. Detailed information on all individual births occurring in the 50 states and DC are
submitted by hospitals to state vital registration offices, which is then reported to the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS). Information on each birth includes date and place of birth along with the
demographic characteristics of the mother, such as age, race, education, marital status, and parity. We use
data for the years 1989 through 2012 that cover pregnancies from 1988 through 2012. We begin our
analysis in1989 because earlier years did not contain information on certain prenatal behaviors. Given
that changes in the minimum wage affect mostly low-educated workers, the primary sample is limited to
women with a high-school degree or less between the ages of 18 to 44 (at time of pregnancy). This yields
approximately 46 million births for the main analytical sample.
We measure two categories of infant health: 1) birth weight; and 2) gestation. Birth weight is
measured as a continuous outcome (grams) and alternately as an indicator for low birth weight (infant was
born weighing less than 2,500 grams). Gestational age is measured continuously in weeks, and also as an
indicator for whether the infant was born preterm (gestation < 37 weeks). 6
In order to assess potential mechanisms linking the minimum wage to infant health, we also study
key measures of prenatal inputs available in the birth certificate data. First, we use two measures of

6

Prior to 2014, gestational age of a newborn was based on the date of the last normal menses (LNM). Beginning in
2014, there has been a transition to a new standard based on the obstetric estimate due to some concerns that the
LNM measure may have weaker validity due to issues with imperfect maternal recall and other forms of
misinterpretation. Martin, Osterman, Kirmeyer, and Gregory (2015) nevertheless find that the two measures were in
agreement for the 2013 birth certificates. The obstetric estimate was within 1 week of the LNM estimate for a total
of 83.4% of records, and within 2 weeks for 91.4% of all 2013 records.

13

prenatal smoking: smoking participation and smoking more than 5 cigarettes daily during pregnancy. 7
Birth certificates are generally thought to provide a reasonably reliable source of data on prenatal
smoking status for large observational studies (Nielsen et al., 2014), although underreporting of smoking
status has been suggested for as much as one-fifth of smokers (Tong et al., 2013). While underreporting
can inflate our variance estimates, it is unlikely that it is systematically correlated with the minimum
wage, which would bias our estimates of the effect of the minimum wage. We utilize three measures of
prenatal care: the number of prenatal care visits, an indicator for whether there were fewer than five
prenatal visits over the pregnancy, and the number of months that prenatal care was delayed since the start
of pregnancy. 8
5.b. Minimum Wage
The effective minimum wage in a state is the higher of the state’s legislated minimum wage or
the federal minimum wage. We obtain these data from the US Department of Labor. 9 Figure 1 shows the
considerable variation in the minimum wage across states and over time. Over our sample period (19882012), the federal minimum wage increased from $3.35 to $7.25. Among states, which had set a
minimum wage that superseded the federal level, the average minimum wage increased from $3.74 to
$7.92. Currently, there are 29 states plus DC with minimum wage rates set higher than the federal
minimum wage of $7.25/hour, compared with 10 states in 1988. For our main analyses, we use the real
($2012) minimum wage, which is the nominal wage deflated by the consumer price index, but we report
results for several other measures in the Appendix and note that estimates are not sensitive to how we
measure the minimum wage. Specifically, in some analyses we use the nominal minimum wage and we
also follow Card (1992) and Clemens (2015) and normalize the minimum wage by the median wage rate

7

These outcomes are not reported by some states (for instance, CA, IN, NY, SD, OK) over all or part of our sample
period. We exclude births occurring in these states when analyzing these behaviors. Limiting all analyses to those
states with consistent information on smoking does not materially alter our results or conclusions.
8
We also used other measures of prenatal care, such as first trimester intiation and the Kotelchuck index (estimates
not reported in text). Results using these alternative measures are highly similar to those reported in text, in terms of
relative magnitudes, significance, and direction of effects.

in the state, and refer to this as the “relative minimum wage”. The motivation underlying this relative
measure is to capture the “bite” of the minimum wage; if the median hourly wage in the state is
substantially higher than the minimum wage, then the minimum wage is less binding, and increases in the
minimum wage may elicit smaller responses on labor outcomes (Lee, 1999). Therefore, we take the ratio
of the nominal minimum wage in the state to the prevailing state-specific median “hourly” wage. The
median wage is estimated from annual earnings and work hours from the March CPS. The larger is this
ratio, the more binding is the effective minimum wage in the state.10
We match the average minimum wage to the birth records by state and over the two-year period
prior to the year and month of birth. 11 Specifically, we take the average of the real minimum wage across
3 time points: birth month, 12 months before birth, and 24 month before birth. All other time-varying
state variables are matched based on state and year of pregnancy.
5.c. Policy Controls
In addition to the minimum wage, our regression model includes controls for other state policies
that may affect infant health. We follow the standard in the welfare reform literature (see for instance
Dave, Corman, & Reichman, 2012; Blank, 2002; Kaushal and Kaestner 2001; Schoeni & Blank, 2000)
and include dichotomous indicators for whether a given state in a given year had a statewide waiver in
place that substantially altered the nature of AFDC with respect to time limits, sanctions, or work
requirements. We also include a dichotomous indicator for whether the state had implemented TANF in
time period t. 12 Data on whether states had waivers and when they enacted TANF come from U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services (1997; 1999). We control for state EITC legislation via three
measures: 1) an indicator for whether the state had an EITC program; 2) an indicator for whether this
state’s EITC is refundable, which means that the state will refund the credit if no taxes are owed; and 3)

10
To address any potential endogeneity concerns from the minimum wage concurrently affecting the median wage
rate in the state, we use the one-year lag of the median wage. In practice, whether we divide by the median wage at
time (t) or time (t-1) does not make much of a difference.
12

For states which implemented an earlier waiver to their AFDC programs, the AFDC indicator is set to 0 when
these states later implement TANF.

state EITC as a percentage of federal credit. In the late 1980s through the early 1990s, about one-third to
half of the states which offered a tax credit made it refundable. In 2012, virtually all states’ (20 out of 24)
EITC’s were refundable. We obtain information on states’ EITC programs from Tax Credits for Working
Families, Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, and the National Conference
of State Legislatures. 13 We also control for the Medicaid income eligibility expansions for pregnant
women which occurred during the late-1980s through mid-1990s by including the fraction of women who
would be eligible for Medicaid in a given state during each period. 14
5.d. Sample Description
Table 2 presents sample means for births occurring in 1989 through 2012 for subgroups defined
by age and marital status. On average, the sample is 26 years old and two-thirds have a high school
degree (one-third less than high school). Approximately half the sample is White, 30% Hispanic, 18%
Black and the remaining of other racial groups. Birth outcomes (birth weight, low birth weight, preterm
birth) are significantly worse among single mothers, particularly older single mothers. The average real
minimum wage over this period was $6.97.
6. Results
6.a. Full Sample of Low-educated Mothers
Table 3 presents estimates of the effect of minimum wages on infant health and maternal
behaviors. Several measures of infant health are used: birth weight in grams, indicator of low birth weight
(<2500 grams), gestational age in weeks, fetal growth (birth weight divided by gestational age) and preterm birth. Three measures of prenatal care are used: number of visits, an indicator for fewer than 5 visits,
and an indicator for first trimester care. Two measures of maternal smoking are used: any prenatal
smoking and an indicator of whether mother smoked more than 5 cigarettes daily. Each cell in Table 3
represents the effect of a $1 increase in the real minimum wage.

Estimates in Table 3 indicate that a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 4.04
gram (0.1%) increase in birth weight; a 0.09 percentage point (1%) decrease in low-birth weight; and a
0.075 unit (0.1%) increase in fetal growth. All estimates are statistically significant. 15 To provide an idea
of what these effects imply in terms of the expected change in annual income, we use the “affected hours”
calculations in Table 1 to derive the effect of a $1000 increase in annual family income on outcomes. In
Table 1, the “affected hours” for the full sample is 477, or $477 of annual family income. Therefore, we
scale the estimates in Table 3 for the full sample by 2.1 ($1000 divided by $477). After scaling estimates
in this way, results suggest that a $1000 increase in annual family income is associated with an 8.5 gram
(0.2%) increase in birth weight; a 0.2 percentage point (3%) decrease in low-birth weight; and a 0.16
(0.2%) unit increase in fetal growth.
One way to view these scaled estimates is that they are instrumental variables (IV) estimates of
the effect of a change in income on infant health. This approach assumes that the earnings effect from a
higher minimum wage represents the only causal pathway linking the minimum wage to infant health.
Treatment effects calculated this way should be interpreted with caution because small changes in the
denominator, which in this case is “affected hours”, can lead to large changes in implied IV estimates.
Nonetheless, it is a useful exercise to place our minimum wage effect in context and compare it to effects
derived from another major income transfer program, namely the federal EITC. Hoynes et al. (2015)
examined the effects of expansions in the federal EITC, which also increased income (and employment)
among eligible households, on infant health outcomes. They estimate that the effect of a $1000 increase

15

Appendix Table A1 reports the coefficients for the full models for birth weight. These estimates generally imply
effects consistent with expectations and prior studies. Birth weight increases with the educational attainment of the
mother, and is higher among mothers who are white (relative to black or other race), Hispanic, and married. An
increase in the state’s EITC generosity is positively associated with infant health. We do not find any evidence that
expanded Medicaid eligibility is significantly associated with increases in mean birth weight; prior studies have been
generally mixed on the effectiveness of these expansions in improving infant health (Currie and Gruber 1996;
Howell 2001; Dave et al. 2008). The coefficient of mean birth weight among higher educated mothers is significant
with confidence intervals that do not include one, suggesting that higher educated mothers would not be a valid
counterfactual within a DDD framework.

17

in income induced by the EITC expansions on birth weight was 6.4 grams (0.2%) among low-educated
single mothers. Thus, our estimate of 8.5 grams (0.2%) for low-educated mothers is very similar.
Higher birth weight may reflect either an improvement in fetal growth and/or an increase in
gestational age (reduction in preterm birth), or both. We show estimates of the effect of the minimum
wage on gestational age (measured in weeks) and preterm birth in Table 3. Estimates indicate that a $1
increase in the minimum wage is associated with an insignificant and very small increase in gestational
age and an insignificant and very small decrease in pre-term birth. Comparing these estimates to those for
birthweight suggest that the main explanation of the increase in birth weight is fetal growth, although the
increase in birth weight is quite small.
Estimates in Table 3 suggest that the minimum wage is associated with a small improvement in
infant health. While several causal channels may underlie these effects, many of which are not observed
in the data available, we are able to assess whether the improved infant health is consistent with effects on
prenatal care and maternal smoking. Estimates in Table 3 indicate that a $1 increase in the minimum
wage is associated with a significant: 0.17 (2%) increase in prenatal care visits; a 0.0034 (5%) decrease in
probability of having less than 5 prenatal care visits; and a 1 percentage point (1%) increase in the
probability of obtaining care in the first trimester. Estimates also indicate that an increase in the minimum
wage is associated with a reduced likelihood of any prenatal smoking and smoking more than 5 cigarettes
daily. Effect sizes are modest: a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 1.4 percentage
point (7%) decline in maternal smoking and a 0.9 percentage point (6%) decline in the probability of
smoking greater than five cigarettes per day.
Estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on prenatal care and smoking are also consistent
with the estimates from the EITC literature. Hoynes et al. (2015) also finds that the federal EITC
expansion reductions in prenatal smoking and expansions in prenatal care. They find that a $1000
increase in income (associated with the EITC expansion) reduced the likelihood of prenatal smoking by
about one percentage point (4.1% relative to the mean). Our estimates suggest that a $1000 increase in
income (associated with the higher minimum wage) also reduced the probability of smoking during
18

pregnancy among low-educated mothers by about three percentage points (16%). Averett and Wang
(2013) also find that the income effect induced by the federal EITC expansion reduced maternal
smoking. 16
Appendix Table 2 presents estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on infant health and
maternal behaviors from several alternative model specifications that differ by whether we include timevarying, state-specific controls, the mean outcome of college-educated women, and the specifications of
year-by-month fixed effects, year-by-demographic factor fixed effects, and state-by-year fixed effects.
These additional specifications account for potential identification threats related to non-linear year-bymonth trends, differential time trends across demographic groups, and most importantly for our design,
differential time trends between states. Estimates from these alternative models are very similar to those
in Table 3 and provide evidence that the difference-in-differences design seems valid.
6.b. Heterogeneity of Effects Across Demographic Groups
As suggested in Table 1, there is some differences in “exposure” to a minimum wage increase. In
Table 4, we present estimates for different groups of low-educated mothers stratified by age and marital
status. Estimates in Table 4 reveal a very noticeable pattern: effect sizes are larger for young (ages 18 to
29) and married mothers and the largest for young, married mothers. This pattern of estimates is
consistent with the pattern for “affected hours”—estimates of the effect of the minimum wage are larger
for demographic groups with more “affected hours”. The one exception is for older (ages 30 to 44)
married mothers.
Effect sizes remain quite small even for the groups with larger and statistically significant
estimates. Among young (18 to 29) mothers, a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with: a
5.41 grams (0.2%) increase in birth weight; a 0.1 percentage point (1%) decrease in probability of having

16
The implied negative relationship between smoking and income that we and others found suggests that smoking is
an inferior good, which is an issue still debated in the literature (e.g., Kenkel, Schmeiser, & Urban, 2014). However,
as we described earlier there are other causal mechanisms besides income that links minimum wage to infant health
and maternal health behaviors. For example, the increases in prenatal care we observe may decrease maternal
smoking because of greater contact with physicians.

19

a low-birth weight infant; and a 0.1 unit (0.1%) increase in fetal growth. For this group, an increase in the
minimum wage is not significantly related to gestational age or pre-term birth. In contrast, estimates in
Table 4 indicate that among older (30 to 44) mothers, an increase in the minimum wage has no
statistically significant or clinically significant effect on infant health. Among married mothers, a $1
increase in the minimum wage is associated with: a 3.82 grams (0.1%) increase in birth weight; a 0.1
percentage point (1%) decrease in probability of having a low-birth weight infant; a 0.05 unit (0.1%)
increase in fetal growth; and a very small (0.014 weeks) increase in gestational age. Finally, as noted
earlier and consistent with the estimates just described, the largest estimates in Table 4 are found for
younger, married mothers, but effect sizes are relatively similar to those discussed.
In Table 5, we report estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on prenatal care and maternal
smoking. For prenatal care, we find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with a small
increase in the number of prenatal care visits and most estimates are statistically significant. There is less
heterogeneity across demographic groups in effect sizes than for birth weight and low-birth weight.
Estimates suggest that a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with between a 0.15 (1%) and
0.25 (2%) increase in the number of prenatal care visits. Estimates also indicate that a higher minimum
wage is associated with similarly small improvements in the other two measures of prenatal care. For
maternal smoking, estimates show that a higher minimum wage is associated with less smoking. In this
case too, estimates are relatively similar across demographic groups and are quite small; a $1 increase in
the real minimum wage is associated with approximately a 1.5 percentage point (7%) decrease in
maternal smoking.
6.c. Additional Specifications
We conducted additional analyses to assess whether alternative measures of the minimum wage
and alternative specifications of the minimum wage yield similar estimates as those reported above. In
Appendix Table 3, we report estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on infant health and maternal
behaviors using the nominal minimum wage and relative minimum wage (minimum wage divided by
median wage). Estimates in Appendix Table 3 are similar to those reported in Table 3. For example, a $1
20

change in the nominal minimum wage, which represents a 20% increase, is associated with a 5.6 gram
increase in birth weight. In Table 3, estimates indicate almost the exact same result: a 20% increase in the
real minimum wage is associated with a 5.6 gram increase. Other estimates in Appendix Table 3 are also
similar to the analogous estimates in Table 3. In sum, the way the minimum wage is measured does not
affect estimates.
In Appendix Table 4, we present estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on infant health
and maternal behaviors for models that allow the minimum wage to have different effects prior to and
during pregnancy. We show results for two specifications that differ by whether we measure the
minimum wage during one-year or during two-years prior to pregnancy. Estimates in Appendix table 4
show an interesting pattern. The minimum wage during pregnancy is significantly and positively
associated with birth weight, gestational age, and fetal growth and negatively associated with pre-term
birth. The minimum wage prior to pregnancy has little effect on these outcomes. For these outcomes,
estimates associated with the minimum age during pregnancy are approximately the same as those
reported in Table 3. In the case of low-birth weight, however, the minimum wage during pregnancy and
the minimum wage prior to pregnancy have approximately the same effect. This implies that the estimate
of the effect of the minimum wage in Table 3 reflects a cumulative effect of the minimum wage on lowbirth weight. For prenatal care, the minimum wage during pregnancy is positively and significantly
associated with the number of visits. In contrast, it is the minimum wage prior to pregnancy that is
negatively associated with maternal smoking. While we do not have ready explanations for this pattern of
results, as there are a variety of explanations that are consistent with these findings, the upshot is that it is
not only the contemporaneous minimum wage that can influence infant health, but also the cumulative
and prior minimum wage that can affect maternal health and maternal financial status that can have
lasting effects on infant health.
6.d. Compositional Changes and a Falsification Analysis
In this section, we address two issues: whether the minimum wage is associated with changes in
the composition of mothers and whether we find any effect of the minimum wage on infant health and
21

maternal behaviors of college educated women who are arguably unaffected. We examine potential
composition selection by directly estimating whether the minimum wage has affected maternal
characteristics. Specifically, using the individual-level data, we estimate regressions testing
whether the minimum wage affected the probability that a given birth occurs to a mother who is lower vs.
higher educated, married vs. single, white, black or other race, and younger vs. older. We find a slight
increase in the probability (about 2 percentage points) of married mothers and slight decline in probability
(0.4 percentage points) of age 25-29 years with higher minimum wage. The estimates however do not
point to any substantial changes in the composition of births. We continue to find improvements in infant
health even when we stratify based on marital status and/or age (as discussed above).
The final analysis we discuss is a falsification test. We re-estimated the models underlying Table
3 using a sample of college educated mothers ages 25 to 44. We restricted the sample to those 25 and
older because we required mothers to have a college degree to be included in the sample. This group of
women is largely unaffected by the minimum wage, for example, the “affected hours” for this group is
189 (Table 1), and therefore, we expect to find no association between the minimum wage and infant
health and maternal behaviors. Estimates for this sample of college educated mothers are shown in Table
7. All estimates but one in Table 7 are statistically insignificant and all are very small both relative to the
mean for the sample and relative to estimates in Table 3. Overall, estimates in Table 7 provide evidence to
support the validity of the difference-in-differences research design and are consistent with estimates in
Appendix Table 2 that show that our primary set of estimates is not materially affected by model
specification.
7. Conclusion
The debate over the merits of a minimum wage and over the level of the minimum wage have
been frequent and ongoing for decades. Most of that debate is focused on the labor market effects of the
minimum wage with employment being the most oft debated outcome. However, the increase in income
associated with the minimum wage, which is widely acknowledged for all but the least skilled persons,

22

may have benefits in other domains. Here we examined whether the minimum wage affected infant
health.
Our results suggest a small, significant and beneficial effect of a minimum wage increase on birth
weight and the probability of low-birth weight. Estimates suggest that an increase in the minimum wage
that causes a $1000 increase in annual household income is associated with a 8.5 gram (0.3% relative to
the mean) increase in birth weight and 0.2 percentage point (2.5%) decrease in low birth weight. We
found similar effect sizes for other demographic groups with slightly larger effects observed for younger
and married mothers. Results also identified two potential pathways that are consistent with the beneficial
effect of the minimum wage on infant health: greater prenatal care and reduced maternal smoking. Again,
the effect of the minimum wage on these health behaviors is relatively small, but significant. For
example, an increase in the minimum wage that causes a $1000 increase in income increased the number
of prenatal care visits by 3%.
Our findings are broadly consistent with estimates of the effect of the EITC on infant health,
which is another policy that affects incomes of low-wage workers. Thus, there is a growing body of
evidence that labor market policies that enhance wages can affect wellbeing in broader ways than often
considered. These “other” effects of the minimum wage should enter the debate over its merits.

Notes: “Affected hours” represents the average annual work hours that will likely be affected by an increase in the minimum wage in each group.
These hours were calculated using the CPS Earner Study data based on the following steps. First, we identified all census families including at least
one low- educated female aged 18-44 years. Second, for each of these census families, we identified all family members (paid on an hourly basis or
not) whose reported or estimated hourly wage was less than 1.25 times the state minimum wage in a given year (or alternatively less than
1.33*minimum wage; or less than minimum wage plus $1). Third, we derived a family-level weekly affected hours by summing the weekly work
hours across all those family members identified in the prior step (0 week hours assigned for other family members). Fourth, we averaged familylevel affected weekly work hours across families and multiplied that average by average annual work weeks which estimated from the CPS March
Supplement data (following to the first and second step for weekly hours). For each demographic subgroup, a family was selected if there was at
least one female with these demographic characteristics.

Notes: Estimates from OLS regressions are reported in column 1. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary
correlation in the errors across observations within each state, and reported in parentheses in column 2. Each
estimate in column 1 represents the effect of a $1 increase in the real minimum wage in 2012 dollars averaged over
2 years prior to birth. Regression models include state, year, and month of birth fixed effects. Models also include
the following individual-specific covariates: dummy variable indicators for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and
educational attainment; and the following state-specific covariates: employment-to-population ratio,
unemployment rate, mean wage rate for males, mean wage rate for females, indicator for state EITC, indicator for
refundable state EITC, state EITC as a % of federal EITC, indicator for AFDC waiver, indicator for TANF, fraction
of pregnant women eligible for Medicaid, and the mean outcome rate among married college-educated mothers
ages 25-39. Sample sizes range from 41.42 million to 43.94 million observations. Asterisks denote statistical
significance as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤ 0.05

Observations

Notes: Coefficients from OLS models are reported. Each cell represents the effect of a $1 increase in the real minimum wage in 2012 dollars. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary
correlation in the errors across observations within each state, and reported in parentheses. The models control for the state, year, and month of birth fixed effects. Models also include the
following individual-specific covariates (when different from dependent variable): indicators for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment; and the following state-specific
covariates: employment-to-population ratio, unemployment rate, mean wage rate for males, mean wage rate for females, indicator for state EITC, indicator for refundable state EITC, state EITC
as a % of federal EITC, indicator for AFDC waiver, indicator for TANF, fraction of pregnant women eligible for Medicaid, and the mean outcome rate among married college-educated mothers
ages 25-39. Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤ 0.05.

Estimate of Effect of
Minimum Wage
Birth weight (grams)

Notes: Estimates from OLS regressions are reported in column 1. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation in the errors
across observations within each state, and reported in parentheses in column 2. Each estimate in column 1 represents the effect of a
$1 increase in the real minimum wage in 2012 dollars averaged over 2 years prior to birth. Regression models include state, year, and
month of birth fixed effects. Models also include the following individual-specific covariates: dummy variable indicators for age,
race, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment; and the following state-specific covariates: employment-to-population
ratio, unemployment rate, mean wage rate for males, mean wage rate for females, indicator for state EITC, indicator for refundable
state EITC, state EITC as a % of federal EITC, indicator for AFDC waiver, indicator for TANF, fraction of pregnant women eligible
for Medicaid, and the mean outcome rate among married college-educated mothers ages 25-39. Sample sizes range from 19.63
million to 20.44 million observations. Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤
0.05

Notes: Estimates from OLS regressions are reported in column 1. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary
correlation in the errors across observations within each state, and reported in parentheses. Regression models
include state, year, and month of birth fixed effects. Models also include the following individual-specific
covariates: dummy variable indicators for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment; and the
following state-specific covariates: employment-to-population ratio, unemployment rate, mean wage rate for males,
mean wage rate for females, indicator for state EITC, indicator for refundable state EITC, state EITC as a % of
federal EITC, indicator for AFDC waiver, indicator for TANF, fraction of pregnant women eligible for Medicaid,
