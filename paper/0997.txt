Adjustment to Expected and Unexpected Oil Price increases

ABSTRACT

For

oil importers, differences in economic performance after the

1973—74 oil price increase and after the 1979—80 increase can be
attributed to a number of factors, including the fact that the 1973-74

oil price increase was unexpected whereas the 1979—80 increase was
largely expected.

In this paper, we analyze how an economy's adjustment to expected
oil price increases might differ from its adjustment to unexpected

increases. By expected oil price increases, we shall mean ones that
were anticipated in the past, and by unexpected oil price increases,
we shall mean those that were not anticipated in the past but occur

unexpectedly in the present. We model this distinction using a three—
period model, where the periods are called the past, present and future.

Introduction

For many oil—importing developed economies, the adjustment to the
1973—74 oil price increase and to the 1978—79 increase differed markedly,
even though the magnitude of increase relative to the size of their

economies was roughly the same in each period.1 While countries often
experienced recession and an acceleration of inflation after each oil
price increase, there were noteworthy differences in degree between the

two periods. For some, such as Japan, the adverse consequences of the
second major oil price increase were much less severe, particularly in
the areas of consumer prices, industrial production and employment.2
Differences in economic performance in the two periods have been
attributed to cyclical factors, industrial restructuring, policy actions,
and the willingness of industry and labor to accept the cost of the

terms—of-trade decline brought about by higher oil prices.3 Less
attention has been given to the role of expectations as a contributing

factor. While there has been some work on the role of expectations in
the adjustment process, it has focussed on how adjustment differs when

oil price increases are expected to be temporary rather than permanent
(e.g. Sachs (1981), Bruno (1982), Svensson and Razin (1982), Svensson
(1981), Marion (1981) and Marion and Svensson (1981, 1982)).

In comparing

the 1973—74 and 1978—79 experience, another distinction merits
examination —

that

between expected and unexpected oil price increases.

By expected oil price increases, we shall mean ones that were anticipated
in the past, and by unexpected oil price increases, we shall mean those
that were not anticipated in the past but occur unexpectedly in the

present.4 The different economic performance after each oil price

2

increase may be due, in part, to the fact that the 1973-74 oil price
increase was unexpected, whereas the 1978—79 increase was largely
expected.

In this paper, we present a theoretical model which enables us to

analyze how an economy's adjustment to expected oil price increases might
differ from its adjustment to unexpected increases.

A priori, it seems that with expected oil price increases, the
adjustment can start in the past and

be spread out over time. With

unexpected increases, there can be no adjustment in the past, so all of

the adjustment must take place in the present and the future. Nevertheless, while the need to adjust in the present may be larger for unexpected
price increases, the capacity to adjust may be less, since we might
expect more rigidity and less substitution possibilities in the present
in the face of unexpected price increases.

We shall model some of these aspects rigorously in a three—period

model, where the periods are called the past, present and future. We
shall calculate changes in output, oil imports, consumption, investment,
welfare, the trade balance and the current account of a small oilimporting economy when there are present and future oil price increases,
in one case when these are anticipated in the past, in the other when
they are not.

The following results are derived under the assumption that oil and
capital are "cooperative" factors:

First, if wages are flexible and there is full employment, current
domestic product falls less for unexpected oil price increases than for

expected increases. The reason is that with unexpected oil price increases,

3

firms have no opportunity to reduce past investment and hence they operate

in the present with a relatively larger capital stock. This outcome
illustrates that firms have less substitution possibilities in the short
run.

Both present consumption and investment fall more with unexpected
oil price increases, loosely speaking because the necessary downward

adjustment of consumption and investment takes place only in the present
and future but not in the past.
It follows that unexpected oil price increases cause a smaller

deterioration in the trade balance than expected increases. However,
they don't necessarily cause a smaller current-account deficit. This
is because expected oil price increases stimulate greater saving in the
past and hence lead to a larger service—account surplus in the present.
Second, if real wages are predetermined so that full employment

results if previous expectations are fulfilled, then full employment will

be maintained only for expected oil price increases. For unexpected
increases, there will be a fall in present employment if labor and oil

are cooperative factors. This drop in employment causes an additional
drop in present domestic product. It no longer follows that the fall
in present domestic product is unambiguously smaller or that the trade
deficit deteriorates less for unexpected oil price increases than for

expected increases. In fact, if the employment effect is large enough,
the opposite may be true. This case may be more in keeping with the
experience of 1973—74, when real—wage adjustment was sluggish.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the model.
Section 3 compares the economy's response to expected and unexpected

4

oil price increases. Section 4 shows how the comparative results are
modified when there are predeteinined real wages and the possibility

of less than full employment. Section 5 contains concluding remarks
and possible extensions.

2. The Model
Consider a small open economy in an intertemporal framework. There
are three periods, indexed t =

0,

1 and 2, called the past, present and

future, respectively. In each period the economy produces final goods,
using domestic capital and labor and an imported intermediate input

called oil. There is no domestic oil production. Oil and final goods
are traded on the world market in each period at given relative prices.

There is a world credit market where the country can borrow and lend at
given world rates of interest.
Let the production function in period t,be

x = ft(ktzt)

where x

is output of final goods, kt is the capital stock, and z is imported
oil We suppress the labor input, implicitly assuming full employment
of a fixed supply of labor. In Section 4 we relax this assumption in
order to deal with predetermined wages and variable employment. We assume
that the production function is strictly concave in the two remaining

arguments. We define the Domestic Product (DP) function for each period

asYt(, qt, kt)= max{xt —

qtzt: x = ft(kt,zt)},

where qt is the spot

price of oil in terms of final goods in period t. The first argument of
the DP function, the price of final goods, is set equal to unity since

we shall use final goods as nunieraire. The DP function has the standard
properties that equilibrium final goods output and oil imports are given
by

This completes the discussion of the supply side. Let us now deal
with demand. With regard to welfare and consumption, the economy is

where c denotes

consumption of final goods in period t. The corresponding (present value)

expenditure function is defined as E(c50,

U(c°, c1, c2) > u}. Equilibrium consumption is given by

(2.5)

c = Et,

0,

t =

1 and 2,

where Et denotes the partial of the expenditure function with respect to
the present value price of goods in period t.
The intertemporal budget constraint of the economy can now be
expressed as

where the capital stocks fulfill

(2.7)

kt = kt+

1tqt+l kt) for t =

0 and 1.

Equation (2.6) states that the present value of expenditure on consumption

and investment equals the present value of domestic product. It can be
taken as expressing the welfare level u as an implicit function of the initial
capital stock, k°, the oil prices in the three periods, q°, q1 and q2,

and the present value factors, S° and .

The level of welfare can be

substituted into (2.5) to give the equilibrium levels of consumption. The
equilibrium level of final goods output, oil imports and investment are

given by (2.1) and the investment functions. Hence for a predetermined
past capital stock and exogenously given oil prices and discount factors,
the equilibrium of the small open economy is fully determined.

The equilibrium can be interpreted as a perfect foresight equilibrium

over time. Equivalently, it can be viewed as a sequence of temporary

8

equilibria, where variables referring to later periods are perfect

foresight expectations and plans. We shall examine how the perfect
foresight equilibrium varies with a change in oil prices.
First, we consider an initial equilibrium (over time), with given

oil prices q°, q1 and q2. Next, we consider the effects of an oil
price increase in the present and the future, i.e. a permanent oil

price increase, with dq1, dq2 > 0. We assume initially that this

oil price increase is anticipated in the past. We analyze howthis
expected increase changes the endogenous variables relative to the

initial equilibrium. In particular, we are interested in how expected
oil price increases affect the small economys welfare and how they
change domestic product, oil imports, investment and consumption in

the present period. We are also interested in how the present trade
balance and current account respond. To calculate these changes,
we merely differentiate the equilibrium conditions.

We also wish to compare these changes to those which occur when
oil price increases are unexpected, i.e. not anticipated in the past.
In this case, agents in the past expect present and future oil prices

to equal qt1 t = 1, 2.

As they enter the present, they learn that

dqt > 0, t = 1, 2. We represent this case by a temporary equilibrium
in the present, conditional upon past values of production, investment

changes in the endogenous variables relative to the initial equilibrium
can now be derived by differentiating the relevant equilibrium conditions.

In

the next section, we examine the changes in various endogenous

variables for the case where oil prices are expected and for the case
where they are not, and we compare the two cases.

3. Expected versus Unexpected Oil Price Increases
In this section, we compare the effects of expected and unexpected
oil price increases on domestic product, output, oil imports, investment,

welfare and consinnption. We also compare their effects on the present
trade balance and current account.

10

Domestic product, output and

oil

inputs

First, let us compare the response of current domestic product

to expected and

unexpected

oil price increases. Differentiating the

DP function, we find that the change in domestic product given an expected increase in oil prices is

dY1 =

(3.1)

-dq1

+

YdI0

<

The first term on the right—hand side of (3.1) represents a negative
oil terms

of

trade effect. The second

term is

the

effect of a change

in past investment on present domestic product, with
(3.2)

dI° =

Assuming

the partial 1° is negative; firms desire a smaller present capital

in light of higher oil prices and reduce their past investment plans

accordingly. The drop
of

in

trade effect cause a

past investment as well as the negative terms

fall in present domestic product.

The change in current domestic product due to an unexpected

oil

price increase is

(3.3) d =

—z1dq1

<

0,

where tildes over .fferentials or partials denote that they are conditional
upon given past variables. Now the drop in domestic product is due to
the negative terms of trade effect only. Since firms
the oil price increase prior to

period 1,

did

not anticipate

they had no opportunity to

reduce past investment. It follows that the fall in current domestic

11

product is less for unexpected oil price increases, i.e.

dY1 < dY<

(3.4)

0.

Of course, this outcome depends on three factors. First, oil
and capital are cooperative inputs, so that firms

will

reduce past

investment if they anticipate oil price increases. Second, firms utilize
the entire inherited capital stock in production even if for unexpected

oil price increases the ex post marginal product of capital, Y, is less
than the real interest rate, r0. Since firms have already purchased the
present capital stock, they will find it optimal to fully utilize it as

long as its marginal product is positive. Third, full employment of
labor is maintained. In Section 4 we find that pre—set wage contracts
introduce employment effects which modify the outcome in (3.4).

We next compare the responses of current output and oil inputs to

expected and unexpected oil price increases. From (2.1) we get the
change in present output and oil inputs given an expected oil price
increase:

(3.5)

The first term on the right-hand side of each equation represents the
11/

negative substitution effect of higher oil prices.—' The second term
is the negative effect of lower past investment.
When oil price increases are unexpected, there is no change in past

investment. The fall in present output and oil inputs reflects only the

12

negative substitution effect, with

Although firms find themselves in the present period with
than they would have liked had they known

of

more

capital

the forthcoming oil price

increases, they nevertheless find it optimal to utilize it fully. Therefore they end up producing relatively more output and using relatively
more oil inputs in the present when oil price increase are unexpected.
Essentially firms have less room for substitution in the present, given
the capital stock inherited fran the past.

Investment
For expected oil price increases, the change in present investment
is

(3.7)

d11 = 11dq2 +

Idk1

= 11dq2

-

dI°

0.

The first term represents the change in present investment due to an in-

crease in future oil prices. When oil and capital are cooperative in
future production, firms will desire a smaller future capital stock and

so invest less today; i1dq2 <

0.

The second term represents an increase

in present investment due to an increase in present oil prices. Since the
increase in present oil prices lowers past investment but does not change

the optimal future capital stock, it leads to an equal and offsetting

change in present investment, i.e. I = —1.

It appears that present

investment may either increase or decrease in response to expected

oil price increases, of

course,

on net, investment falls over

13

the past and present, since dI° + d11 < 0, and the smaller the adjustment
in the past, the more likely that investment will have to fall in the
present.

For unexpected oil price increases, the change in present investment
is

= 11dq2 <
q

(3.8)

0.

Present investment unambiguously falls.

There is no offsetting change in

past investment, in contrast to the case with expected oil price increases.
Comparing (3.7) and (3.8) we see that if present investment falls

in both cases, it falls relatively less when oil prices are expected. This
is because firms can react to expected increases by spreading the drop in

investment spending over the past and present. With unexpected oil price
increases, firms must make all of the adjustment in the present.

Welfare

We now compare the welfare effects of expected and unexpected oil

price increases. Differentiating (2.6) and making use of (2.1), (2.3)—(2.5)
and (2.7), we get du, the change in welfare for an expected oil price in-

crease. We find that

(3.9)

Edu =

—z1dq1 — cS2z2dq2 <

0,

where E is the partial of the expenditure function with respect to the
welfare level and represents the inverse of the marginal utility of wealth.

Equation (3.9) indicates that the small country faces a negative oil terms
of trade effect in the present and in the future and consequently suffers
a welfare loss when oil prices increase.

14

The change in welfare brought about by an unexpected oil price
increase, dii, can

(3.10)

be

calculated by differentiating (2.8), which gives

dii = —z'dq1

-

52z2dq2 < 0.

As before, the welfare effect consists of the oil terms of trade effects,
although the inverse of the marginal utility of wealth is evaluated

conditional upon a given past consumption. It turns out that
the inverse is the same in both cases, i.e.

=

E,]-.a" so the

first—order

effects on welfare are the same for expected and unexpected oil price

increases. That is,

(3.11)

du =

dii

<

0.

The second—order effects on welfare are different, of course, and inclusion of the second—order effects would make the total welfare loss from

unexpected oil price increases larger than for expected oil price increases. However, taking these second—order effects into account would not

Consumption

When

oil

price increases are expected, the change in present consumption

is

(3.12)

dc1 = C1E du <

Wu

0,

which is equal to the welfare effect (3.9) times the marginal propensity to

consume present goods out of wea1th.-" Since oil prices reduce welfare,
they lower present consumption.

15

For unexpected oil price increases, we find

(3.13)

d& =

<

0.

Comparing (3.13) with (3.12) and recalling that Edu =

(3.14)

d1 - dc1

=

we find that

( - C)Edu.

In the absence of any particular reason for households to favor consump-

tion in any one period over any other, the conditional marginal propensity
to consumer should be larger than the unconditional since with the former,
households had no opportunity to adjust their spending in the past.

It follows that C >

C and

the fall in consumption is greater for unex-

pected oil price increases. Although we shall take this to be the case,

the opposite outcome is certainly plausible. For instance, if consumption
adjusts with some inertia, then the fall in present consumption could be
less with unexpected oil price increases.

The Trade Balance and the Current Account
Since we have already compared the effects of expected and unexpected
oil price increases on domestic product, investment arid consumption, it is

a straightforward exercise to compare their effects on the present trade
balance and current account.
The present trade balance is simply

(3.15)

difference between domestic product and expenditure on consumption and

investment.

If we add to both sides of (3.15) net interest income from abroad earned

16

during the past, r0T0, we get the present current account,

(3.16)

- q1z1

b1 = T1 + r0T0 =

which is the difference between national product,

absorption, c1 + i1, or equivalently, the difference between national

saving [(x — q z ÷ r T )

.1

I

and investment, i

To calculate the change in the present trade balance when there

are expected oil price increases, we differentiate (3.15). We get

(3.17)

dT1 = dY1 —

dE1

— d11,

where dY1, dE1 and d11 are given by (3.1), (3.12) and (3.7), respectively.

Expected oil price increases reduce present domestic product, which worsens
the trade balance, but they also reduce present consumption and may, under

previously specified circumstances, reduce investment as well. Any drop
in absorpti'on improves the trade balance.hul'

For unexpected oil price increases, we again differentiate (3.15) in
order to calculate the trade balance response,

(3.18)

d& =

d'

-

where d'1, dE1 and

d1

-

d,

are given by (3.3), (3.13) and (3.8), respectively.

Comparing the trade balance response for expected and unexpected oil

price increases, we find that

(3.19)

dT1 - dT1 =

-YdI° -(ã - C)Edu

-

dI°

> 0,

Equation (3.19) indicates that, under full employment, the present trade
deficit (surplus) is unambiguously smaller (larger) for unexpected oil

17

price increases than for expected oil price increases. The first term
on the right—hand side of (3.19) is the investment effect on domestic

product. With unexpected oil price increases there is no fall in past
investment, so present domestic product is relatively higher. This helps
make the trade deficit smaller for unexpected oil price increases.
The second and third terms are the consumption and investment effects,

respectively, and we have already noted that present consumption and investment fall more for unexpected oil price increases since there was no adjust-

ment in the past. Since unexpected oil price increases reduce domestic
product less and reduce absorption more than expected oil price increases,
they cause a smaller deterioration in the trade balance.
The same

cannot

be said for the current account. While unexpected

oil price increases cause a smaller deterioration in the trade balance,

expected oil price increases generate more improvement in the service
account.

Therefore

unexpected oil price increases may cause either a

larger or smaller current—account deficit (surplus) than expected oil price
increases.

Specifically, oil price increases which occur inthe present and the
future have no effect on past output, but if they are expected, they do
permit households and firms to begin reducing their consumption and in-

vestment in the past. Hence the country saves more in the past and receives
a greater inflow of interest income in date

These

additional interest

income inflows do not take place if oil price increases are unexpected.
Comparing the current-account response in the two cases, we find that

As (3.15) makes clear, expected oil

price increases cause relatively greater trade deficits but relatively
greater service—account surpluses, so we cannot say anything definitive
about the relative current-account response to expected versus unexpected
oil price increases without more information on specific parameter values.

Table 1 summarizes our results. It shows that the small economy
responds differently to expected and unexpected oil price increases. All of
the comparisons are made on the assumptions that oil and capital are cooperative factors and that labor is fully employed.

In the next section,

we show how the existence of pre—set wage contracts can modify these re—
suits.

4. Predetermined real wages and employment effects
We shall now consider a situation in which a period's real wage
is set in the previous period so as to equate expected labor demand to

19

labor supply. This modification does not change our prior analysis
concerning the effects of expected oil price increases since full em—
ployment of labor results when the previous period's expectations about

oil prices are fulfilled. However, for unexpected oil price increases,
the

predetermined real wage for period 1 ensures full employment only

if oil prices are unchanged. When oil prices unexpectedly increase,
employment in date 1 falls. This employment effect leads to a greater
drop in domestic product, output, oil inputs, welfare and consumption. It is

then no longer true that unexpected oil price increases cause a smaller
drop in output, oil inputs and the trade balance than do expected increases.

More precisely, let the production function be x =

where the labor

supply. The DP function will be yt(1 qt, kt, 9.t) and

(4.1) can be used to solve for the labor input as a function of the other
variables,

in

giving the

employment function Lt(1, qt, kt, wt).

Actual employment

period t is now a function of the actual oil price in period t.
For unexpected oil price increases, the present employment level will

fall by

is negative if labor and oil are cooperative factors.2.2/'

20

There is no reduction in employment in the future since future oil
price increases are anticipated when wage contracts are negotiated in

Conclusions

We have rigorously modeled the adjustment of a small oil—importing

country to expected and unexpected oil price increases. For expected
present and future oil price increases — expected in the sense of being
anticipated in the past - we have seen that the adjustment of investment
and consumption begins in the past, whereas with unexpected oil price
increases, all adjustments must take place in the present and future.
Regarding output and oil inputs, we have seen that there are less

substitution possibilities with unexpected oil price increases than with
expected, since firms must operate with a predetermined, larger—than—
desired capital stock when faced with unexpected oil price increases.

Consequently, output and oil inputs fall less with unexpected oil price

increases. However, with predetermined real wages, unexpected oil price
increases lead to a fall in employment which adds to the drop in output

and oil inputs. With regard to the present trade balance, we have seen
that under full employment it deteriorates less for unexpected oil
price increases since domestic product falls less and consumption and

investment may have to fall more. With predetermined wages, unexpected
oil price increases reduce employment and hence cause a greater

deterioration in the trade balance. If the employment effect is large
enough, unexpected oil price increases can now cause a larger fall in

the trade account than expected price increases. With respect to the
present current account, we have seen that both under full employment
and variable employment the current account balance may change more or
less with unexpected oil price increases than with expected increases.

But if the employment effect is sufficiently large, unexpected oil price

23

increases will cause the greater deterioration in the current account.

Let us add some qualifications of these results. First, it is
clear than an oil—producing economy, or an economy producing investment
goods for the (world) oil industry, would react differently, even if it

imported some of its oil. The boom in the oil industry or the oilinvestment industry brought about by higher oil prices could dominate
the fall in output in sectors that use oil as an input only.
Second, we have generally assumed that the present period's marginal

propensity to consume conditional upon unchanged past consumption is
larger than the unconditional one, which makes present consumption fall

more for unexpected oil price increases. If, as previously mentioned,
consumption adjusts with some inertia, the present conditional propensity

to consume would be smaller than the unconditional one. This ordering
would occur if, for instance, household consumption is complementary
with some household investment in the previous period, a situation which
could be modeled using a consumption technology with a household production function.

Third, with respect to predetermined real wages, we have assumed
that the lead time in wage determination is the same as the information
lead, so that full employment is maintained for expected oil price

increases. If the lead time in wage determination is longer, unemployment
would occur with expected oil price increases as well as with unexpected

ones. A rigorous analysis would require more periods on continuous time.
Finally, we have modeled a small economy facing given world rates

of interest. A world equilibrium analysis with endogenous rates of
interest could easily be undertaken along the lines of Marion and

24

Svensson (1981) in order to examine the general-equilibrium effects of
expected vs. unexpected oil price increases. One issue that might be
of interest is whether the present rate of interest is depressed more or
less by unexpected than expected oil price increases and whether any
fall in the rate of interest is temporary or permanent.

Following R. Solomon (1980), we may take the size of the OPEC

increase in the OPEC surplus from 1978-80 was about the same magnitude,

relative to the GNP of the industrial world, as the $60 billion increase

from 1973 to 1974. Alternatively, one can calculate the percentage
increase in the average dollar price of a country's crude oil imports

between 1973—75 and between 1978—80 and calculate the increase in a
country's petroleum imports as a fraction of GNP to see

The implication is that expectations held in the past are no

Let rt, t=0, 1, denote the final goods rate of interest

between period t and t+1. Then the present value factors 6 and 62

a "capitaliza-

We disregard any corner solutions. Equation (2.3) says that

the value of the present marginal product of capital, Y, plus the
present value of the future marginal product of capital, 62y=1, equals
the present value of past investhient goods, 50• Equation (2.4) says
that the present value of the future marginal product of capital equals
the present value of present investment goods.

to the usual definition of complements/substitutes in terms of the cross

derivatives of the factor demand functions. With only one capital good
and one kind of oil, it is equivalent to positive cross partials of

the production function, i.e. f > 0.
