ENDOCENOUS ELECTION TIMINGS AND POLITICAL BUSINESS CYCLES IN JAPAN

ABSTRACT

This paper constructs a theoretical model of political
business cycles in a Parliamentary system and tests predictions

and hypotheses of a theoretical model against the post-war
Japanese data. Unlike in a presidential system, the timing of a

general election is an endogenous policy variable in a
parliamentary system. Thus, one of the interesting questions in a

parliamentary system is whether elections cause business cycles
or economic expansions trigger general elections.

Empirical analyses of the post—war Japanese experience
strongly indicate that the Japanese government did not manipulate

policies in anticipation of approaching elections as political

business cycle theories in a presidential system indicate.
Instead, general elections were usually held during times of
autonomous economic expansion.

In other words, the Japanese

government opportunistically manipulated the timing of elections
rather than the economy.

I. Introduction

This paper constructs a theoretical model of political
business cycles in a parliamentary system and tests against the
postwar Japanese data predictions and hypotheses derived from the
theoretical model. Unlike in a presidential system, the timing of

a general election is an endogenous policy variable in a
parliamentary system. Prime Minister in Japan may dissolve the

House of Representatives anytime during its four-year term''
Thus, one of the interesting questions in a parliamentary system
is whether elections cause business cycles or economic expansions
trigger general elections.

Empirical analyses of the post-war Japanese experience
strongly indicate that the Japanese government did not manipulate

polidies in anticipation of approaching elections as political
business cycle theories in a presidential system could indicate.

Instead, general elections were usually held during times of
autonomous economic expansion.

In other words, the Japanese

government opportunistically manipulated the timing of elections
rather than the economy.

Models of political business cycle theories with myopic
voters start from the underlying premise that the electorate has

preferences among economic outcomes that are reflected through
its voting behavior.

Low unemployment, low inflation and high

output garner more votes for an incumbent partyo However, voters

are also presumed to be myopic: In evaluating the general state

—1—

of the economy, they take into account only recent past
experiences without any future expectations.

Politicians, only

interested in winning elections without much regard for the
welfare of the society, thus stimulate an economy before the
election at the cost of post-election inflation. As politicians
try

to

exploit the trade-off in the short-run Phillips curve

every four years, business cycles are created.

The literature in this strand can be classified along two

lines: The traditional theory by Nordhaus (1975) and Tufte
(1978); and the partisan theory by Hibbs (1977, 1987), Beck
(1982), and Alesina and Sachs (1988).'2 According to Nordhaus,
an incumbent party generates expansions near elections and then
induces contractions to control the overheated economy after the
election. Hibbs and his followers, on the other hand, emphasizes

the partisan nature of politics.

He argues that parties with

different core constituencies pursue different economic policies.
The change in parties cause the change in social priorities.

Recently, models with rational voters have been developed,
with two lines of thoughts.

Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) and

Rogoff adn Sibert (1988) considered a model in which political

parties, whose objective is to maximize the probability of
staying the power, faces rational voters who rationally expect
how political parties possibly manipulates the economic policies

for elections.

Alesina (1987) and Alesina and Sachs (1988)

investigated models with two parties with different social objec-

tives play repeated games and test against the U.S. postwar data.

Most of these works have been conducted in the framework of
the U.S. presidential system, in which elections come once every
four years. Careful applications of the idea to other countries,
taking into account a different political system, are scarce. In

fact, in the parliamentary system like one in Japan, the timing
of elections is not fixed, but subject to a discretion of Prime

Minister. Instead of manipulating an economy in an attempt to
line up the peak of business cycles to the fixed election timing,

the incumbent party may opportunistically wait for a business
cycle peak which is generated by autonomous forces of private
sectors.

An investigation on political business cycles in Japan is
important in several aspects.\-1 First, the Parliamentary nature
of the Japanese government requires us to construct a model which

allows for endogenous election timings. Although political
business cycles in Britain, as a part of cross-country studies,
have been investigated earlier, no rigorous theoretical framework

for a parliamentary system was proposed. In section 3, I will

propose a general model which describe interaction between
election (timing) and business cycles.

Second, election timings are chosen by policy makers
depending on the course of the economy, while the policy is
conducted in expectation of elections.

This implies that the

simultaneity bias becomes a problem in estimating effects of

—3-.

economic performance on election timing and effects of expected
election on policy manipulation. We will empirically answer the
question whether elections cause booms or booms trigger elections
in Japan, correcting for the simultaneity bias.

Inoguchi (1983)

was the first to emphasize endogeneity of election timing in
Japan. He concluded that it was more likely that the Japanese
government seized the opportunity of good economic performances
to call a general election. He attributed his finding in part to

a strong bureaucratic system independent from political
influences. Although his insight was novel, his conclusion was

not based on rigorous estimation procedures and hypothesis
testings. \

Ito and Park (1988) devised an econometric test of the

endogeneity of election timings. They investigated whether

economic variables influenced the probability of election
timings, given the time elapsed from the last election.

They

found a significant effect of unexpected better performance of
the economy on the probability of election. They have also tested

whether monetary and fiscal policies were manipulated in the
expectation of electjons.

They did not find an evidence that

economic policies were manipulated.

Cargifl and Hutchison (1988) also investigated whehter the
probability of elections was influenced by economic performances.

They came down to an opposite conclusion from Ito and Park: "the

incumbent party does not appear to systematically use generally

—4-.

good economic conditions (or news of these conditions) in its
decisions to call elections early."

In the subsequent paper,

Cargill and Hutchison (1989) examined whether the reaction

of monetary policy (captured by the interest rate or the
money supply) of Bank of Japan was influenced by the election
function

timings

(dummy variable), and found that after 1975, the Bank of

Japan a systematic downward shift in the interbank rate preceding

Lower House elections. Moreover, the effect is. tempered by the
strength of the incumbent party..

The rest of this paper is. organized as follows.

Next

section will make . an informal observation at the relationship

between the growth rate and the, election timing. Section 3 will

present a theoretical. model in which the election timing is
optimally chosen by the government. An empirical analysis of the
traditional theory (effects of elections on policy manipulations)

will be carried out in section 4. A hypothesis that election
timing is endogenously chosen will be tested in section 5.

II. Casual Observations

Suppose, as uaual, that the government tries to call an
election in a quarter with good economic performances, say, the
growth rate. Then we should expect to find that the growth rate

tends to be higher in election quarters.

Now recall the

Constitutional constraint that the general election has to be
called before the end gf four-year (16 quarter) term.

Suppose

also that the government cannot manipulate economic performances

—5—

with certainties. Under uncertainty, the government would call
an election near the end of the four-year term even if the growth

rate is only moderately high, because time may run out on the
incumbent

without a quarter of a very high• econmic

growth rate.

In sum, we expect that the probability of election tends to

increase with growth rate and to increase as the number of

an election called relatively early in the term is accompanied by

a very high economic growth rate and an election called near the
end, of the term may be accompanied by a moderately high economic

growth rate.Hence, when we plot the growth rate of each election

cycle (y-axis) against the number of quarters

elapsed' (x—axis),

the end of election cycles (election timing) tend to be downward

samples are divided into two periods, before and after the first

oil crisis.

Samples before 1955 are not used, because the

formation of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) via merging two
parties in 1955 changed the political structure.
Insert figures 1 and 2 here

In Figure 1, the downward-sloping election threshold is
evident. Elections called between 10th and 11th quarters since

—6—

last elections are accompanied by growth rates exceeding 4
percent. When the term went into the 4 year (13th quarter), the

election was called at the growth rate as low as 2 percent.
However, in each case, the growth rate of each election quarter

is higher than the preceding quarter. Moreover, the plot of
election quarters (marked by dots and quarter identifications)

show the downward-sloping property predicted in the earlier
discussion in this section.

In Figure 2, the downward-sloping property is not evident.
The first election cycle after the first oil crisis went to the
full four—year term for the first time.

It is likely that the

government did not realizes that the structural change had
occurred so that the growth rate is permanently lower. The
government waited for a high growth quarter, and waited. But it
never came. In retrospect, the government should have called an

election in the 10th quarter, when the growth rate was 2.4
percent, which was much lower than the election threshold of the

pre-oil shock phase (Figure 1), but which turned out to be much
higher than the subsequent quarters. The election cycle started

in 1980:1 lasted only a half year. Clearly this was not a good
time to have an election: it was a low growth rate and too early

in the election cycle. However, this early dissolution was due
to an "accidental" passage of the nonconfidence vote on the hira

cabinet. Hence, this election cycle is an outlier from our
viewpoint of political business cycles.

III. Endoqencus election tining: An Example

In the preceding section, an observation was made that an

election was called at a lower growth rate if the number of
quarter since last electiOn was greater. In this section, I will

develop an theoretical example in which an optimal decision of
the government produces the choice of election timings with the
observed characteristics.

Suppose that the full term of House of Representatives are

four periods (years). The number of periods elapsed since last
election is denoted bys. Suppose that the economic growth rate,
is the only relevant variable for voters in the election, and

there are only three possible states with regard to g, High

moderate growth, gM, and low growth gt, with an equal

rate,

g5,

If the government

calles an election in a period with the growth rate g, the
political value of the election is the expected value of being
the power in the next election cycle. Let us denote by V(g5) the

political value of calling an election in a period with growth
rate g5. The value will be calculated later as a value functiOn

of dynamic programing problem. An election

Elections in a

moderate growth rate would make an incumbent party to win with a

small margin, yielding the political value of m: V(gM)nm. ir an
election is held in a low growth period, the incumbent party is
assumed to lose a majority, and the opposition takes over a

government with a moderate margin.

The fixed value, -k,

represents the agony of defeat and the discounted sum of expected
political values being as an opposition party: V(gL) = -ic.

If the incumbent party decides not to call an election, the

party extracts political utility to be in the power, b(g0, s).

The utility is a compoSite of psychic satisfaction and the
financial donation from the private sector to the party.

The

utility is an increasing function of g0 since the maintaining a

wide margin gives an easy management of the govenment and the
House of Representatives. The utility is decreasing function of
s, because the returns to be in the power will deminish.

Thus, let us assume the utility of staying power in the speriod after the election is,
s) =

b1/s,

s= 1,2,3: and b(gM, s) = bM/s,

s= 1,2,3.

Note that the election with the low growth rate ga implies the

loss of majority. ThéreiS no b assigned for this case, since
the fixed political value of election, -k, already takes into
account the value being outside the power.

1: The last election at

Suppose that the last election was held in a high growth
period. We calculate the polical value of the last election by
calculating the value backwards.
In the fourth period since the last. election (s=4), another

election must be held, so that the expected (period 3) value for
the fourth period is

h/3 + m/3 -

5=4)

k/3 = (h-I-m-k)/3.

In the third period, if an election is not held, the utility of

staying in power b/3 is earned in that period and the expect
value EV(g4, h) is also earned: the sum being (b+m+h-k)/3. If an

election is chosen, the political value of election V(.) is
earned depending on the state of economy. The election decision
is made. Let us assume, for example,

h >

m

(bM+h+m-k)/3

>

>

-k.

(1)

This implies that in the .third period after election1 thehigh or

moderate economic growth would trigger an election. But the low
growth will. not. Given this condition, the expected value of the
-

third period is

EV(g0=g, s=3) = h/3 + m/3 + (bH+h_k)/9
= (bH+4h+4m_k)/9

The second period decision problem is similar: Knowing g2, the
government calls an election if V(g2) >

b/2

+ EV(g0=gM, s=3).

The right hand side of this inequality is the sum of the value of

staying in power during the second period and the expected value
of going into the third period. Let us assume, for example,

h >

(llb0

+ 8h ÷ 3m —

2k)/18

>

n

>

-k

(2)

Then, an election option is chosen only if high growth is
achieved in the boom in the second period.

Moderate and low

growth will make the incumbent government to wait and see, while
the government enjoys commanding the power. The expected value is

then

EV(g0=g, s2) = h/3 + (2/3) (lib + 8h + 3m - 2k)/lB
=

(llb

The decision problem at the beginning of the first period is to
compare bH + EV(g0=g1 s=2) with V(g1). Assume that
(38b1 + ]7h + Sm — 2k)/27 > h

(3)

Then, an election is not called even with high growth in the
first period after the last election.

Therefore, the expected

value is
EV(g0=g11, s=l) =

Now the value of V(g'1)=h is endogenously solved by equating the

Suppose that the last election was held at a moderate growth

Case 1:

In the third period, if an election is not carried out, the

utility of staying in power bM/) and the expect value EV(g0=gM,

If an

and comparing V(g) with (bM+h+m_k)/3, the

election decision is made. Let us assume, for example,

(5)

This implies that in the third period after elections the high or

moderate economic growth would trigger an election, as was in
Case 1. With this decision rule being known, the expected value
is

EV(g0=gM, s=3) = (bM+4h+4m_k)/9.

In the second period, the no—election option would produce

Then in the second period, the election is called unless growth
is in the low state. Then, the expected value is
EV(g0=gM, s=2) =

(1/3)*(llbM+8h+8m_2k)/ls.

(ll,54)bM

=

In the period 1, the value of no election is bM + EV(g0=gM, s=2).
Let us assume

Therefore, if growth is high, an election is called even in the

Case 3: The last election at
If an election is called in the low growth period, the party

loses the majority, and the opposition party takes over as a
moderate winner.

Solution
The political values of calling an election in high and
moderate are thus calculated endogenously and simultaneously by

equations (l to (9). The solution to the above problem is said
to exist, if we find parameter values, bH, bM, b', h, m, k, and

c, satisfying all inequalities (l)-(3), (5)-(7), and (9) and
equalities (4) and (8).

A simulation program to find such a solution can be easily

constructed by first assigning values to bH, bM, k, and c, and
second, solve from (4) and (8) for h and m. Then check whether
inequalities- (l)—(3), (5)—(7), (9') are satisfied. For example,

the following values satisfy all the conditions (l)—(8), and
(9'):

c=5, k=30, bH=20, iiLio; then (4) and (8) are solved for h and n;

h =

258.373...,

m — 252.3413

It is easily verified that inequalities (1)—(3), (5)—(7), (9')
are satisfied.
Election decisions, solving an example of dynamic programing

problem described above, are illustrated in Figure 1.

Call an

election (0) or No election (x) is indicated as a function of the

growth rate g and the elapsed time since last election s. From

this figure the following two properties in analogy of search
theory

are observed.

In period s, if an election is called for g5, then it would

These properties were evident in Figures 1 and 2, especially

the former. Now we have just shown that a simple theoretical

model will yield the same properties. Of course, the above
theoretical framework has a lot of simplifying assumptions.
However, it remains my conjectures that these properties will

hold in a generalized framework.

IV. Empirical Results: Traditional Political Business Cycles

A. Popularity Punction

The first step of traditional political business cycles
theory is to find economic variables which voters are watching to

judge the competence of the incumbent party. Natural candidates

of relevant economic variables include, among others, the
economic growth rate, and the inflation rate. The unemployment

rate has been used in the U.S. study, but we do not use this

variable, since the Japanese unemployment rate has been
insensitive to business cycles. An additional dummy variable is
used to distinguish House of Representatives elections that were

held at the same time with Mouse of Councillors elections. They

were called the Dojitsu (same day] elections, or the double
elections.

It has been widely believed that a Dojitsu election

helps the LDP draw its passive supporters to the polling place,

because voters recongnize a higher significance and feel a
greater satisfaction from voting, given the transaction costs to
the poll.

Now, the popularity function is specified as a percentage of

seats captured in a general election as a function of the GNP

growth rate, g, and the inflation rate, p,

dummy, D)

+ b2pt + 4

where v denotes the percentage of seats won by the incumbent
party (LDP), and T denotes the trend. Theory predicts that b1 is

positive and

is negative.

If voters' memory for policy

evaluation is extremely short then the use of quarter—to-quarter

growth (and inflation) rate is appropriate. Cases with the oneyear, two—year and three—year memory are also examined.
Table 1 about here

Results are shown in Table 1. All signs are consistent with

priors and theory. There is a long-term decline in LDP support
and the Dojitsu election really helps the LOP gaining votes. An

influence of the GNP growth rate on votes is positive and
significant in short-memory versions up to two years and an
influence of Inflation rate on votes is always negatively and
significant. These findings are consistent with a popular thesis

of the traditional political business cycle theory (with myopic
voters).

The horizon of voters' evaluation seems to be less than two

years. Although we do not conduct a formal test of length of

memory due to a lack in the degree of freedom, it is not
inappropriate to assume that evaluation include variables in the
past year only. The finding of short memory justifies the use of
a theoretical model in the preceding section.

B. Policy manipulation

In this section we examine whether any visible changes
(beyond seasonal and demand factors) exist in monetary and fiscal

policy occurred around the election time.
elec-3.cxt

.

18

An idea is to test

whether an election would cause the government to conduct
expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.

As policy tools, we selected the money supply (M2+CD) growth

rate, and the ratios of government consumption and expenditures

to GNP. The choice of M2+CD is natural, because Bank of Japan
watches M2+CD as opposed to Ml as an important monetary aggregate

after 1975 (See Ito (1988)). The dummy variable for the regime
change will be introduced.

The government consumption or investment represents a fiscal

side of government discretion. Political favors in Japan often

take a form of bringing public projects for constituents.
Moreover, government transfers, which have been used in the
literature, are a difficult figure to obtain in Japan, since many

relevant transfers are done in the local level rather than the
central government level.

The Japanese government investment

share of ON? is much higher than the United States, and it is an

important policy variable. The tax burden and transfer payments

do not adequately reflect the fiscal policy being pursued.

Hence1 only government investment (GI) and consumption
expenditures (GC) are included in our fiscal reaction functions.
The GI/GNP or GC/GNP ratio is adopted as the fiscal measure.

First, a naive approach of including an election dummy on
the right hand side will be estimated. If the election quarter
is exogenously determined and perfectly known to the monetary and:

fiscal authorities, then the use of election dummy variable is
elec-3.txc

-

19

justified. If there is a lag between policy manipulation to the
result of an economy, then manipulation may occur in the period

preceding to the election quarter4 Hence, the election dummy,
ELEC(t) or ELEC(t-l) is used in the estimation.

However, the naive approach of using an election

dummy

would suffer from the simultaneity problem, if the (result of)
manipulation affect the election timing.

The simultaneity bias

can be avoided if we use exogenous variables which would predict
the (unconditional) probability of elections.

Namely, the time

(in number of quarters) elapsed since last election (TSLE) can be

used for this purpose. Alternatively, the ga post probability
distribution of post—war elections (PREL) as a function of TSLE
can be used, when voters are assumed to have a knowledge of such
a probability distribution.

In

other words, the insignificant coefficient of the value of
election dummy, E, casts a doubt on monetary manipulation in
Japan.

Table 2 about here
(ii) Fiscal Policy

The fiscal policy in Japan has gone through a significant

regime change just as the monetary policy did.

The Japanese

government pursued balanced budget principle until 1965.
Although deficit financing became legal in 1965, it was not until

the mid-l970s that the debt-GNP ratio had skyrocketed in an
attempt to combat contractions due to the first oil crisis. Yet,

the government budget share of national income remained at a
relatively low level compared to those of other countries.

We

the first oil crisis dummy (1 after 1974:1); and other right—

hand-side variables are the same as the monetary manipulation
equation.

The estimation results are summarized in Table 2, panels B.

Again, there is no evidence to the hypothesis that the
probability of an upcoming election, represented by ELEC, TSLE or
PRE1, influenced the government consumption or investment.

In sum, we do not detect any influences of election
(probabilities) perceived by a function of the elapsed time since

last election on the conduct of either monetary or fiscalpolicy
in Japan.

V. Opportunistic Government Hypothesis
Section 2 and 3 provided the casual observation and a simple

theoretical model for a hypothesis that election timings are
endogenous, or, to put simply, booms trigger elections, while the

evidence in section 4 suggests us that the traditional causality
in the literature, namely election causes booms, is not detected

in Japan. In this section, we will develop an econometric test
to nest the two hypotheses in the same equation.

A. Preliminary Investigation

It is our hypothesis that an election timing depends on
economic growth, g, inflation, p, and the number of quarters
elapsed since last election, TSLE. However, due to the possible

missing variables, such as political events, the relationship

elec-3.txt

-

-

between an election timing and the three variables is not
deterministic.

In this section, The election probability is

estimated as a function of the three variables:
PEt

a +

b1g

+ b2p + b3TSLEt +

where PEt is the probability of election; and 4

is

the

distrubance term due to the missing observation, which are
assumed to be independent of economic variables and TSLE.

The estimation resuts, using LOGIT and PROBIT, are shown in
Table 3, panel A.

The positive and significant coefficient on

economic growth implies that economic booms trigger an election.
An inflation tends to lower the probability of election.
Insert Table 3 about here
So far, it has been shown that economic conditions influence

the probability of election. When combined with the results in

Section 4 (that is policies are not responding to the
anticipation of elections), it shows that booms cause elections,

and not vice versa.

However, it may be desirable to nest two

hypotheses in one equation.

B. Econotuetric Test
In order to clarify what I mean by a elections-cause-booms

hypothesis and a booms-trigger-elections hypothesis, the
following two hypotheses are introduced.

First, the manipulative cabinet hypothesis.

The election

timings are determined in advance by (non-economic) political

reasons, which econometricians do not know. Although the length
of election cycle in a parliamentary system does vary, it works

like the presidential system if the timing is known to the
government in advance.

The government manipulates the economy

through monetary and fiscal policies in an attempt to cause a
boom without inflation at the time of election.

Second, the opportunistic cabinet hypothesis. The incumbent

government does not use monetary or fiscal policy- in order to

influence the economy, just because of an election.

The

incumbent waits for a timing in that some non-government, septor

shocks cause high growth and low inflation. The Japanese
incumbent cabinet has four years to grab a right moment.

The

threshold of calling an election as a function of economic
performance would change as the full term approaches.

The proposed test of manipulative vs. opportunistic
government requires the econometrician to decompose growth and

inflation into policy-induced parts and non—government sector
shocks.

We assume that the former is captured by the expected

component of actual growth and inflation, while the latter is

captured by the unexpected part.

Each of the growth and

inflation equations is regressed on the constant, trend, money

growth (1 to 6 lags), government consumption and government
investment.

manipulations, and residuals, as the effect of non—government

Footnotes
1.

A general election could be called in three different

reasons. First, a general election must be held, if not earlier,

at the end of a four—year term of Lower House members. Second,
an election can be called if Prime Minister voluntarily dissolves

the Lower House.

Prime Minister could find some excuses to

dissolve the Lower House if he thinks that the timing is
politically advantageous.

Third, if the Lower House passes a

non-confidence resolution against the cabinet, then the Prime
Minister has to either disesolve the Lower Rouse or resign.

If

the latter, the Lower House elects new Prime Minister without a
general election.

The Japanese Parliament or the Diet, which closely resembles

the British system, is divided into two houses; the Rouse of
Representatives (Lower House) and the House of Councilors (Upper

Rouse). The head of the government, Prime Minister, is elected

by the election among the member of the Lower House.
Traditionally, the head of a majority party (or a coalition of
parties) becomes Prime Minister.

Also a majority of Cabinet

members are required to be selected from the Lower House.

On

occasions when the two houses are in conflict, the Lower House
usually commands more power. TherEfore, the Lower House carries

more political power than the Upper House. The election of the
Lower House members, the general election, is the most important
political event.

The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has dominated both houses

since its creation by merging the Liberal and Democratic parties

in 1955. The ruling party has an incentive not only to achieve
the majority but also maximize the number of seats in the House,

since the management of the House is much easier with a wider
margin.

Therefore, although the LDP has maintained a majority

most of the time, it is reasonable to assume that the party has
pursued an objective of maximizing the seats in the House.

2. Golden and Poterba (1980) and Frey and Schneider (1978) have

estimated the so-called popularity function in order to test

whether the President's popularity depends on economic
conditions.

Golden and Poterba also models how the government

uses fiscal and monetary instruments to produce political
business cycles and rejects Nordhaus' theory.

Similarly,

MoCallum (1978) finds no support for the hypothesis.

MacRae

(1977) enalyzes whether the electorate is myopic or not.

To

examine the welfare consequences of the traditional hypothesis,

Chappell and Keech (1983) construct a complete macroeconomic
model and concludes that the six—year presidential term generally
entails less social welfare loss.

3. Japan is an excellent testing ground for the theory of
political business cycles, since the business and government are
said to enjoy much closer relationship than in the United States.
Management of business cycles (either creating one or taming one)
is presumably easier in Japan than the United States.

sector shocks, from these equations are used in the probit and
logit equations of election timings. If the manipulative cabinet

hypothesis is the case, then the coefficients on the policy—

induced growth and inflation are significant; if the
opportunistic government hypothesis is correct, then the
coefficients on the non-government sector shocks are significant.

Results of this test is reported in Table 3, panel B.

The

results strongly suggest that the demand and supply shocks,

independent from policy, tend to trigger elections.

In

particular, there is more likely to be an election (i) when the
surprise growth rate is higher: (ii) when the surprise inflation

rate is lower; and (iii) as the number of quarters elapsedsince
last elections increases.

In sum, the Japanese government opportunistically chose the

election timings rather than manipulated the economy. This
result signals a warning against any simple—minded applications
of presidential—system models to a parliamentary system country.

6. concluding Remarks

The starting point of this research was a point that the
election timing is endogenous in a parliamentary system. A boom
may trigger an election. In this paper, how endogenous election
timings can be investigated theoretically and empirically.

We

found that the Japanese government (the LDP) has chosen the
timing of elections at or near the local peak of business cycles.

elec-3.txt

-

An influence of election anticipation on the monetary and fiscal

policies was not in general detected.

In sum, the Japanese

government was found to be opportunistic in choosing the timing
of' election, rather than to be actively creating policy—induced
booms just for elections.

As concluding remarks, some social welfare implications may

be discussed. If a manipulation of an economy is harmful and if
the government is induced to exercize a power, the presidential

system gives a wrong incentive from the viewpoint of smoothing
business cycles. Instead, by allowing the government to choose a

timing of elections, the government's incentive to distort a
'usiness cycle is mitigated.

However, the opportunistic hypothesis, as modeled in this
paper, has a different danger. The incumbent's right to choose

election timings tend to perpetuate the popularity of the
incumbent party, other things being equal.

Moreover, the

incumbent would prefer to have a business cycle more volatile
than otherwise if the voters' memory is short, and prefer to have

a shorter cycle to insure that the peak arrives within the four

years. Of course, these arguments can be denied if voters are
fully rational and capable of seeing through how much of business

cycles are policy-induced and how much are exogenous shocks.

However, constructing a model with fully rational (forward—
looking) voters ma parliamentarly sytem is out of the scope of
this paper and left for future research.

Some researchers, however, night question at an outset the
applicability of political business cycles in Japan, claiming the
folláwing points.

First, there was practically one party that

ruled the post-war Japan.

The Liberal Democratic Party (LOP)

would not have an incentive to boost an economy, if they knew
that they would get a majority anyway. Second, it is well-known
that the Japanese economy had a low and inflexible unemployment

probability of getting a majority, the LOP had every incentive to

pursue a maximization of seats in the House.

The larger the

margin, the earsier the management of Parliament.

However, the

one-party domiance basically eliminates the applicability of the

partisan theory (unless a research successfully identifies a
leftist and rightist factions withing the LDP). The second point

is valid, but it only means that we have to look for other
variables which reflect voters' concern.

4. Inoguchi (1983; chapter 5) analyzed how the policy (captured

by the change in the official discount rate) responded to
economic variables and policy variable (Table 5-5), and how the

popularity (captured by the surveyed approval ratio of the
cabinet) responded to economic and policy variables (Table 5—6).

Policy decision regressions (Table 5—5) suffered from extremely
low Durbin—Watson statistics and sample—selection. Moreover, his
insight that the government does not manipulate economic policies

is not based on any econometric regressions or hypothesis
testing.

This paper can be regarded as one to develop a

theoretical model and econometric tests of Inoguchi's insight.
