Paternalism and Pseudo-Rationality

JEL No. D61,E70,H00
ABSTRACT
Resource allocations are jointly determined by the actions of social planners and households. In
this paper, we highlight the distinction between planner optimization and household optimization.
We show that planner optimization is a partial substitute for household optimization and that this
is still true when households have private in- formation about their preferences. We illustrate a
novel identification problem: some aggregate equilibrium properties that are implied by
household optimization are also implied by planner optimization. A rational utilitarian planner
enacts policies that cause the Euler equation to hold on average in a population of non-optimizing
households, which we refer to as pseudo-rationality. Hence, widely studied allocative optimality
conditions also arise in an allocatively inefficient economy with a rational planner, who uses tools
such as default savings and Social Security to influence the consumption choices of myopic and
passive households. Accordingly, aggregate classical optimization tests implemented with data
from economies with paternalistic governments cannot reveal whether households would make
optimal decisions on their own.

Introduction

Resource allocations are jointly determined by many actors, including households,

rms,

and governments. In this paper, we study the interaction between households and a wellintentioned government, which we will refer to as the social planner.1 We analyze the case in
which (i) the social planner is a (benevolent) rational utilitarian, (ii) households are heterogeneous in their degree of rationality, and (iii) the social planner has some scope to intervene
 e.g., default savings and mandatory savings, which mirror institutions like 401(k) autoenrollment and Social Security.2 We show that in equilibrium, planner optimization is a
(close) substitute for household optimization. This is true even when there are information
asymmetries, so that households know more about their preferences than planners.
Our analysis illustrates a novel identi cation problem. Are seemingly optimal allocations
caused by optimizing households, or are such allocations caused by planners who paternalistically inuence household behavior? We nd that some widely studied classical tests for
household optimization, which rely on the Euler equation and its variants, do not identify the
causal source of the (average) allocative optimality. Equilibrium properties that are implied
by household optimization are also implied by planner optimization. The actions of rational planners may result in pseudo-rational allocations by endogenously causing the Euler
equation to hold on average in a population of non-optimizing households, including myopic
and passive households, even though the Euler equation does not hold for each individual
household.
To demonstrate these mechanisms, we study a classic life-cycle model in which agents
earn labor income during working life and can save a fraction of their earnings for retirement
consumption. The planner has two policy levers: mandatory retirement savings (similar to
Social Security or de ned bene t pensions), and voluntary retirement savings with a default
1
Naturally, many governments are not (even approximately) well-intentioned. They are not trying to
maximize the well-being of their citizens. These cases can also be studied using the framework in this paper,
but we leave those cases for future work.

De ned bene t (DB) pensions are another example of a mandatory savings scheme. DB pensions have
fallen in popularity in the U.S., though they remain commonplace in other developed economies.

savings rate (similar to 401(k) accounts).3 We consider an economy with three types of
households: optimizing households, who behave optimally throughout their life-cycle, myopic
households, who opt out of the default and consume their entire disposable income in each
period, and passive households, who accept the planners default and consume their residual
income. We include myopes  an extreme type  to emphasize that our results hold even
when the deck is stacked against social e¢ciency. Additionally, we allow for agents to have
privately observed preference parameters of arbitrary structure. Our planner jointly chooses
a default level of savings within the system of voluntary savings accounts and designs a Social
Security system in order to maximize total social welfare, taking into account the behavior
of optimizing households and the suboptimal behavior of myopic and passive households.
We show that, in equilibrium, average marginal utility before retirement is equal to average marginal utility after retirement for any distribution of optimizing, myopic, and passive
households. Such marginal utility smoothing applies to all concave utility functions with a
general class of taste shocks. Accordingly, Euler equations, which characterize an economy
with only optimizing households, also arise in an economy with institutions that are optimally
designed by a planner for non-optimizing households. As such, aggregate Euler equations do
not di¤erentiate between household optimization and planner optimization.
Marginal utility smoothing is closely related to consumption smoothing, which is among
the most common tests for household optimization. The precise form of consumption smoothing depends on the curvature of the utility function and the structure of taste shocks. We
show that when exact aggregate consumption smoothing arises in a world comprised only
of optimizing households, it also arises in our economy with an optimizing planner and any
distribution of optimizing, myopic, and passive households. Moreover, in some leading cases,
exact consumption smoothing does not arise with optimizing households, but does arise with
an optimizing planner and non-optimizing households. These results imply that exact aggregate consumption smoothing is a more robust property of the model without optimizing
households, in contrast to the common view.
3

Later in the paper we show that this restriction to only two policy levers is without loss of generality.
This generalization occurs in Section 6.

3

Although we show that the average Euler equation and average consumption smoothing
are not generally diagnostic of household optimization, we demonstrate that other types of
economic information  both from the cross section and from time series  identify the extent
of household optimization. For example, bunching (i.e., a mass point) at the default savings
level identi es passive households. In the time series, only passive households change their
consumption when the default savings rate changes. Such tests are not confounded by the
equilibrium link between household and planner optimization. As such, they provide ways
to overcome the mis-attribution problems that we highlight. We provide a range of methods
for identifying the mass of optimizing, myopic, and passive households.
Our choice of the particular framework for illustrating our arguments  namely, savings
over the life-cycle  is motivated by the seemingly contradictory ndings of the recent research
on household savings. Some papers

nd evidence that is consistent with optimal savings

while others highlight savings anomalies. See Skinner (2007) and Poterba (2014) for reviews
of this literature and Section 7 of our paper for a speci c discussion of how our model
reconciles the di¤erent sets of ndings. For example, our model implies that household-level
sub-optimization, arising from passivity and myopia, will be partially o¤set by paternalistic
policies, like defaults and Social Security. Hence, the economy that our model describes will
simultaneously feature both household-level mistakes and many characteristics of aggregate
optimality. In equilibrium, the Euler equation is satis ed on average across all households,
though it is not satis ed for some, or potentially even all, individual households.
Our paper is also related to the behavioral economics literature on optimal paternalism. In
our setting the planner chooses policies that dramatically improve the welfare of myopic and
passive agents, while relatively weakly distorting the choices and welfare of rational agents
(whose behavior would be optimal under laissez faire policies). The social desirability of policies that disproportionately a¤ect non-rational consumers was rst highlighted by Camerer,
Issacharo¤, Loewenstein, ODonoghue, and Rabin (2003) in their paper on asymmetric paternalism. Our analysis incorporates defaults, which preserve freedom of choice while still
inuencing behavior. Sunstein and Thaler (2003) and Thaler and Sunstein (2003, 2008) re-

4

fer to such choice-preserving nudges as libertarian paternalism. Our analytic framework also
includes mandates (like Social Security), which fall outside the domain of libertarian paternalism. Our paper derives socially optimal paternalistic policies for households with behavioral
biases, which follows a line of related papers: Diamond (1977), Kotliko¤, Spivak, and Summers (1982), Feldstein (1985), Gruber and Köszegi (2001), Choi et al. (2003), ODonoghue
and Rabin (2003, 2006), Carroll et al. (2009), Fang and Silverman (2009), Loginova and
Persson (2012), Bubb and Pildes (2014), Alcott and Taubinsky (2015), Bubb, Corrigan and
Warren (2015), Chetty (2015), Moser and de Souza e Silva (2015), Farhi and Gabaix (2015),
Bubb and Warren (2016), and Lockwood (2017). Another closely related literature studies self -binding policies, in other words, self-directed paternalism: e.g., Ashraf, Karlan and
Yin (2006), Gine, Karlan, and Zinman (2010), Bryan, Karlan, and Nelson (2010), Amador,
Werning, and Angeletos (2006), Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger (2015), Kaur, Kremer
and Mullainathan (2015), and Schilbach (2015).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our baseline
model in which the population is comprised of three types of households: optimizers, myopes,
and passives. We describe the general (privately observed) taste shocks that these households
experience. We also describe the policy levers available to the government. Finally, we characterize the equilibrium behavior of the households (holding xed the behavior of the social
planner). Section 3 derives the equilibrium behavior of the social planner. In this section we
show that the classical aggregate Euler equation holds, regardless of the proportions of optimizers, myopes, and passives (as long as the social planner is a rational utilitarian). In Section
4, we study several special cases  multiplicative taste shocks, quadratic utility, and constant
relative risk aversion. Using these special cases and our earlier Euler equation results, we derive equilibrium consumption dynamics, which are related to but distinct from the dynamics
of marginal utility. We show that consumption smoothing is a robust feature of our model.
Indeed, the forces that produce consumption smoothing only grow stronger as the fraction
of the population that is myopic and passive increases. In Section 5, we discuss the issue of
identi cation  how can the distribution of optimizing, myopic, and passive households be

5

identi ed? In Section 6, we derive an isomorphism between our analysis and the associated
mechanism design problem. Speci cally, we show that the equilibrium of our model, with a
restricted policy space using only default savings and mandatory savings, exactly matches
the equilibrium that arises when the governments policy tools are maximally generalized and
the problem is treated as a mechanism design problem. Section 7 explains why our model
reconciles several tensions in the empirical consumption literature. Our framework explains
why a population that is comprised of a mix of optimizing, myopic, and passive households
will have relatively smooth average consumption dynamics, although signi cant deviations
from optimality will arise at the level of individual households, including sensitivity to default
savings. Section 8 concludes.

Baseline Model

Setup. We consider a two-period model, where period t = 1 is working life and period t = 2
is retirement. Real output during working life is y1 = y and real output during retirement is
0. Real consumption is denoted c1 and c2 : We assume that the real interest rate, r, is xed
and let R  1 + r: The life-time budget constraint household i faces is

c1 +

c2
 y:
R

Preferences. Consider a household with consumption fc1 ; c2 g and a general taste shifter,
vector : Total life-time utility is given by

U (c1 ; c2 ; ) = u1 (c1 ; ) + u2 (c2 ; );
where  is a discount factor.4 The taste parameter  2  varies across households and is
independently drawn from a common cumulative distribution function F () over a compact
4

The case in which  is heterogeneous across households is embedded in our model. To illustrate this point,
a special case of our model is
b 2 );
U (c1 ; c2 ; ) = u(c1 ) + u(c
where b = :

6

space .5 We assume that  is known to the households at time 0, but not known to the
government. Finally, we assume that u0t ( ; ) > 0 and u00t ( ; ) < 0 for all  and for t = f1; 2g:
To simplify notation, we suppress the i index, and simply refer to households by their
taste shock .
Institutions. There are two kinds of institutions: a voluntary savings account and a forced
retirement savings account. We assume that the planner sets a default level of savings in the
voluntary savings account, sD . The households are able to opt-out of this default at zero
cost. In addition, the planner sets forced retirement savings (a minimum level of savings
from labor income) of sF , which is deposited into the forced savings account during working
life.6 Because sF is de ned as the minimum level of savings, passively following the default
must engender a level of savings at least as great as sF : In notation, sF + sD  sF : Hence,
an operational default requires
sD  0:

(1)

In section 6, we show that the institutional restrictions described in the previous paragraph
are made without loss of generality. In other words, even if the planner solves a completely
general mechanism design problem (for this economy), the solution is the same as the solution
that we characterize for the institutionally restricted model.
Household types. There are three types of households (indexed on a continuum from 0 to
1): Optimizers, Myopes, and Passives. We explain each of these in turn.
Optimizers (notated O) choose the optimal level of consumption in all time periods,
taking into account their private information about  and the institutional constraints that
they face. Optimizing households may not be able to achieve their rst best allocation if
their optimal level of savings is lower than the forced level of savings. Formally, optimizing
5

This common distribution assumption for  can be relaxed. As long as we maintain the assumption
that the government holds rational expectations, we can allow households to have preference parameters that
are drawn from (ex-ante) heterogeneous distributions. To simplify notation, we adopt the assumption of a
common iid CDF, F ():

This is essentially what has been adopted by Australia, Israel, and Singapore, and has similarities to
Social Security in the US.

The rst constraint is the budget constraint. The second constraint is the period-one liquidity
constraint because sF is the level of mandatory savings  i.e., the minimum level of savings.
To characterize the equilibrium behavior of optimizers, fc1 (); c2 ()g, we rst consider the
unconstrained problem  that it, we focus on optimizing households that are unconstrained
during their working life. In this case, the standard Euler equation holds for each household:
u01 (c1 (); ) = Ru02 (c2 (); ):
By contrast, for the constrained optimizing households c1 () = y sF = c1 and c2 () = RsF :
This completes our discussion of optimizers. We now turn to the second and third types
of households.
Myopes (notated M ) opt out of the default and consume as much as possible in every
period. Hence, myopes are constrained only by the forced savings, so that they consume

sF = c1 and cM

Equilibrium with Optimal Institutions

We begin by analyzing the basic Euler equation. First, consider the benchmark of an economy in which all households are optimizers, so that u01 (c1 (); ) = Ru02 (c2 (); ) for each
household. In principle, if an econometrician knew each households value of , then it would
be possible to test this equation at the household level. However, ; which is a taste shock, is
not observable. Moreover, in practice most variables are measured with noise, which prevents
equations from holding exactly. Accordingly, empirical analysis tends to focus on whether the
Euler equation is satis ed on average, that is, whether:




E u01 (c1 (); ) =RE u02 (c2 (); ) :
9

Naturally, this holds in the benchmark economy of optimizing households. Our rst proposition proves that this last equation also holds in our economy, in which optimizing households
can represent any fraction of the economy (i.e., O 2 [0; 1]).
We now characterize the equilibrium allocation in our economy with a rational social
planner. We prove that some basic equilibrium features that are commonly attributed to
household optimization also appear in our partially passive and partially myopic economy as
a result of the planners intervention.
Proposition 1 Assume a rational planner. Then for any distribution of optimizing, myopic,
and passive households, a classical Euler equation will hold on average in the population:




E u01 (c1 ; ) =RE u02 (c2 ; ) :

(3)

Proposition 1 establishes that the aggregate Euler equation (3) holds for any mass vector
 characterizing the fraction of optimizing, myopic, and passive households. The results in
the rest of the paper all have the property that a classical optimality condition holds on
average in the population regardless of the fraction of optimizing households.
The proof of this rst proposition uses three steps that correspond to the following three
lemmas.
Lemma 1 (cD
1 ) At the planners optimum, the default consumption in period 1 is strictly
1 <c
less than maximal consumption in period 1:
cD
1 y

sF

sD < y

sF  c1 :

Equivalently, sD > 0:
The social planner uses the sum sF +sD to pin down total savings for passives. The social
planner recognizes that mandatory savings, sF ; has a negative externality on optimizers, some
of whom are constrained by sF : Note that sD has no negative externality because it only
a¤ects the choices of passives. Accordingly, the social planner sets the default savings rate,
10

sD , strictly greater than zero, which implies that myopes save less than passives: sF < sF +sD :
This rst lemma (sD > 0) is proved in the appendix.
Our second lemma describes a change of variables for the planners optimization problem.
Lemma 2 (Change of Variables) With the institutions we have assumed, the planners
problem is isomorphic to jointly choosing the optimal level of two variables:

In summary, Proposition 1 implies that a standard classical Euler equation characterizes
equilibrium allocations in the economy, regardless of the proportions of optimizers, myopes,
and passives. Note that the Euler equation holds in expectation across all households, but it
does not hold at the level of each individual household. Some households consume too little
in period 1 (optimizers and myopes who have a taste shifter, , that would imply an optimal
level of c1 > c1 ; and passives who have a taste shifter, , that would imply an optimal level
of c1 > cD
1 ). Some households consume too much (myopes who have a taste shifter, , that
would imply an optimal level of c1 < c1 ; and passives who have a taste shifter, , that would
imply an optimal level of c1 < cD
1 ). The Euler equation is only satis ed on average across
the population of households.

3.1

When could an econometrician reject the Euler equation?

Proposition 1 establishes that an Euler equation is satis ed on average in the economy that
we study despite the existence of non-optimizing households. However, as we have explained,
an analogous Euler equation will not be satis ed household-by-household (though it will be
satis ed for all unconstrained optimizers). An econometrician with full information  i.e., an
econometrician who knows household preferences, including each households taste shifter, 
 would be able to test the Euler equation household-by-household,
u01 (c1 ; ) = Ru02 (c2 ; )

for c1 < c1

u01 (c1 ; )  Ru02 (c2 ; )

for c1 = c1 ;

and would nd that it is not universally satis ed. More generally, the econometrician will nd
that the Euler equation holds when she uses the same coarse information that the planner
has, and the econometrician will nd that the Euler equation does not hold when she uses
private, household-level information about the value of  (which is not directly available to
the planner).

Special Cases

We now study the special case in which household life-time utility is given by

u1 (c1 ; ) + u2 (c2 ; ) = u(c1 ) + u(c2 ):

This is a commonly studied case of multiplicative taste shocks (c.f., Atkeson and Lucas 1992;
Amador, Werning, and Angeletos 2006; and Beshears et al. 2015). Without loss of generality
and to simplify notation, we assume that R = 1: We maintain these assumptions throughout
this section.
We rst study the mean of the ratio of marginal utilities before and after retirement,

Accordingly, averaging across all households yields

ratio of marginal utilities equals one, i.e., E uu0 (c

In the next proposition we prove that these relationships hold in our economy as well.

4.1

Consumption Smoothing

The degree of consumption smoothing is widely used as an indicator of household optimization. The mapping from marginal-utility smoothing to consumption smoothing depends
on the curvature of the utility function. In this subsection, we work out this mapping for
quadratic utility and constant relative risk aversion.
For quadratic utility we get exact results. When there are no taste shocks ( = 1 for all
households), we show that E [c2

c1 ] = 0 regardless of the distribution of optimizing, myopic,

and passive households. On the other hand, when there are household-level taste shocks but
no taste shocks on average (E [] = 1), we show that E [c2

c1 ] = 0 only if there are no

optimizing households. Surprisingly, the presence of optimizing households causes average
consumption to fall at retirement: E [c2

c1 ] < 0:

For the case of constant relative risk aversion, we get analogous results studying the rate
of change of consumption at retirement (using a rst-order approximation).
Together, these results imply that consumption smoothing is a more robust property of
the model without optimizing households. In other words, there are leading preference and
taste-shock cases in which consumption smoothing arises without optimizing households but
16

does not arise with optimizing households (and not vice versa).
We now introduce our notation. We study the cases of: (i) quadratic utility, i.e., u(c) =
b 2
2c ,

c

where b > 0, and (ii) constant relative risk aversion, i.e., u(c) =

For each case, we analyze consumption moments under two assumptions:

Lemma 4 demonstrates that when there are no taste shocks, our economy is characterized
by mean consumption smoothing for any distribution of optimizing, myopic, and passive
households. Therefore, in this commonly studied case, consumption smoothing is not a
diagnostic test for household optimization. In addition, with no average taste shocks, the
covariance expressions in Lemma 4 are weakly positive and proportional to the mass of
optimizing households. This introduces some counter-intuitive properties. First, the average
change in consumption (entering retirement) will be exactly zero only when the fraction of


optimizing households is zero (since cov (; c2 ) = cov ; cc12 = 0 if and only if O = 0).
Second, with a positive share of optimizing households, the consumption drop at retirement


increases (since O > 0 implies that cov (; c2 ) > 0 and cov ; cc12 > 0). That is, not only
are consumption smoothing tests not conclusive for analyzing household optimization, but in
the commonly studied case of E [] = 1; exact aggregate consumption smoothing is actually
inconsistent with the null hypothesis of household optimization.
However, the latter qualitative observation turns out to be quantitatively small in the
sense that (calibrated) variance in the taste shock () produces relatively little aggregate
decline in consumption. To see an example of the magnitude of this e¤ect, assume that all
agents are optimizers, have constant relative risk aversion, and that  = exp("
18

 2 =2); where

" is distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of  2 . Then we have

u0 (c1 ) = u0 (c2 );
for all households, which implies that average consumption growth between working life (c1 )
and retirement (c2 ) will be
E ln
If we assume that  = 0:25 and

c2
=
c1

2
:
2

= 2; then the average decline in consumption between

working life and retirement is 1.6%. To gain intuition for this calibration, a one-standarddeviation realization causes a household to prefer a

ln


c2

 2 =2

growth rate in consumption between working life and retirement. With  = 0:25; a onestandard-deviation realization implies either an 11% desired growth rate in consumption or
a -14% desired growth rate in consumption, depending on the sign of the preference shock.

Identi cation of Optimizers, Myopes, and Passives

While the average Euler equation and average consumption smoothing cannot generally reveal
the distribution of household types, tests that rely on other moments of households economic
behavior do reveal the mass of optimizing and non-optimizing households.
Consider the cross-sectional distribution of savings. We characterize the distribution of
overall savings assuming that the distribution of taste shocks, F (), is continuous.
The rst type of test for household optimization relies on the cross section. One indicator
is bunching (excess mass) around the combined levels of forced and default savings, sF + sD .
A discrete jump in the savings cumulative distribution function at this point identi es the
mass of passive households.
Another type of test employs quasi-experiments and relies on behavioral responses to

19

policy variations,9 which can be measured by changes in the distribution of savings (or by
household-level elasticities). First, if there are passive households, a change in the default
level of savings from sD to s0D will engender (new) bunching around sF + s0D . A di¤erent
measure for testing the same hypothesis is the change in average (or overall) savings. If all
households are optimizers, then a change in defaults will keep the distribution of savings,
and hence average savings, unchanged. Any change in average savings would reject the
hypothesis of perfect household optimization, and in our world, would reveal the share of
passive households.
Second, changes to the level of forced savings can shed light on the presence and fraction
of myopic households and of optimizing households. To see this, consider a change in the
level of mandatory savings and evaluate the change in the mass of households that continue
to save no more than the mandatory savings level, sF :
d
d Pr( 2 (
c1 ))
d Pr(s = sF )
=
[O  Pr( 2 (
:
c1 )) + M ] = O 
dsF
dsF
dsF
This change in the mass of households at the forced savings level is positive if and only if
there are optimizing households on the boundary. Indeed, if the observer knows the utility
function and the distribution of ; F (); then the derivative

of optimizing agents, 0 : Once 0 is known, the econometrician can also calculate the mass
of myopes:
M = Pr(s = sF )

c1 )):
O  Pr( 2 (

A related global test can be developed by studying average savings. Consider a decrease
in the forced savings level. If this engenders a one-for-one decline in average economy-wide
savings, then all households are either myopic or passive. However, if the decline is less than
one-for-one, then there is a strictly positive measure of optimizing households: parametric
assumptions on the utility function (and the distribution of taste shifters ) would be needed
9

For instance, policy changes might arise as the government learns about the e¢cacy of new policies (e.g.,
the research that led to passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006).

20

to impute the population mass of optimizers.
The tests that we highlight here are derived from our positive model. However, the
broader point is that an analysis of cross-sectional distributions of economic outcomes and
how they change in response to variation in the economic environment can provide tests for
household optimization that are not confounded by the presence of a rational social planner.

Generalization as a Mechanism Design Problem

In this section, we show that the equilibrium of our model above (which has a restricted policy
space) exactly matches the equilibrium that arises when the governments policy tools are
maximally generalized and the problem is treated as a mechanism design problem. To recap,
the problem posed in Sections 2 and 3 is to choose the two policy variables sF (mandatory
savings) and sD (additional default savings) to maximize the social planners objective

fc2 ()g2 ; cP1 ; and cP2 to maximize the objective in equation (10), subject to the budget
constraints and incentive compatibility constraints in equations (11)-(16). In this mechanism
design problem, optimizers report their type (truthfully in equilibrium), myopes always report
the type that has the highest immediate consumption in the mechanism, and passives follow
the defaults cP1 and cP2 : With this set-up, we can now present our third proposition.
Proposition 3 (Characterization as a Mechanism Design Problem) The mechanism
design problem and the constrained problem (i.e., maximizing equation (10) by choosing arguments sF and sD ) generate the same equilibrium allocation.
This implies an immediate corollary.

the (second-best) optimal allocation is characterized by a maximum consumption rule for

optimizers, which we will de ne after describing an unconstrained allocation. For every type

c2 () = R(y

and the rst order condition
u0 (c1 (); ) = Ru0 (c2 (); ):
Next, consider a di¤erent allocation that assigns consumption (c1 (); c2 ()); for all  2 :
We now de ne a maximum consumption rule.
De nition: Consider an unconstrained allocation (c1 (); c2 ()); for all  2 . Now consider
an alternative allocation (c1 (); c2 ()); for all  2 : This alternative allocation is a maximum
consumption rule if and only if two conditions are both satis ed:
(i) every type with c1 ()  sup2 c1 () obtains c1 () = c1 () and c2 () = c2 () in the
allocation; and
(ii) every type with c1 () > sup2 c1 () obtains c1 () = sup2 c1 () and c2 () = R(y
sup2 c1 ()) in the allocation.
To prove that an optimal mechanism generates an allocation that is a maximum consumption rule for optimizers, consider a candidate allocation given by fb

Note that this new allocation is a maximum consumption rule for the optimizers. This

23

new allocation is incentive compatible for optimizers and myopes: households either achieve
their rst-best allocation or they obtain (
c1 ; R(y

c1 )), which is their most preferred con-

sumption pair in the set of all o¤ered consumption pairs (because of the concavity of u). The
new allocation improves welfare weakly for every agent compared to their welfare in the candidate allocation: agents that achieve their rst-best allocation in the new allocation obtain
a weak improvement in welfare (because they are now at their unconstrained optimum), and
agents that obtain the maximum level of consumption obtain a weak improvement in welfare
(because they previously had b
c1 ()  c1 and they now also have an allocation that uses their

entire endowment). Because the original allocation was not a maximum consumption rule
for optimizers, the new allocation generates a strict improvement in welfare for at least one
type of optimizer.10
Hence, only allocations that are maximum consumption rules for optimizers can be solutions to the mechanism design problem. It follows that the planners problem can be reduced
to the choice of a maximum consumption rule for optimizers  i.e., the choice of c1  and the
choice of cP1 (note that cP1 = cD
1 ). By Lemma 2, the mechanism design problem (choosing
fc1 ()g2 ; fc2 ()g2 ; cP1 ; and cP2 to maximize the objective in equation (10) subject to
the budget constraints and incentive compatibility constraints in equations (11)-(16)) and
the constrained problem (maximizing equation (10) by choosing sF and sD ) are isomorphic
optimization problems. Accordingly, they have the same equilibrium allocation. 

Related Empirical Literature

Our choice of the particular framework for illustrating our ideas  namely, consumption
dynamics over the life-cycle  is motivated by the tension between research that nds relatively
smooth average life-cycle consumption dynamics (consistent with rational consumer behavior)
and research that nds that individual households are highly sensitive to savings defaults
10

There are two ways for an allocation to fail to be a maximum consumption rule. Either (i) there is a type
with c1 ()  c1 ; and that type fails to obtain c1 () = c1 () and c2 () = c2 () in the mechanism; or (ii) there
is a type with c1 () > c1 ; and that type fails to obtain c1 () = c1 and c2 () = R(y c1 ()) in the mechanism.
If case (i) applies, the type is made strictly better o¤ by construction. If case (ii) applies, the type is made
strictly better o¤ because u is strictly concave.

24

(which is inconsistent with rational consumer behavior).
Analyzing life-cycle consumption dynamics, many papers nd evidence that is consistent
with optimal retirement savings. For example, using a structural life-cycle analysis and
accounting for government transfers and Social Security bene ts, Scholz et al. (2006) estimate
that less than twenty percent of households in the Health and Retirement Study under-save
for retirement. Moreover, Scholz et al. (2006) nd that the wealth de cits are generally
a small fraction of life-time wealth. Bernheim, Skinner, and Weinberg (2001) report that
expenditure on food drops at retirement, but Aguiar and Hurst (2005) report that the drop
in food expenditure at retirement is illusory, in the sense that caloric consumption and other
measures of meal quality do not change when households enter retirement.11 Studying overall
nondurable expenditure, Aguila et al. (2011) do not nd a statistically signi cant drop in
consumption at retirement.
Another body of research studies employer retirement savings plans, and shows that
automatic enrollment and other institutional nudges have a large e¤ect on household savings.
Many households do not deviate from the default contribution rate as well as the default asset
allocation, and are largely unresponsive to government- or employer-subsidies for retirement
savings contributions (Madrian and Shea 2001, Choi et al. 2004, Beshears et al. 2009, and
Chetty et al. 2014). A related body of research nds that consumers have a high marginal
propensity to consume out of both anticipated and unanticipated windfalls (e.g., Soulelos
1999, Parker 1999, 2017, Stephens 2003, Stephens and Unayama 2011, Parker et al. 2013),
which is consistent with the existence of subpopulations of myopic (e.g., highly impatient)
and passive households.
Our model is consistent with these seemingly contradictory sets of ndings. Our framework explains why a population that is comprised of a mix of optimizing, passive, and myopic
households will have relatively smooth average consumption dynamics around retirement and
will satisfy an aggregate Euler equation. We show that a benevolent government will set pol11

However, in a recent working paper, Stephens and Toohey (2018) revisit the analysis in Aguiar and Hurst
with a broader set of data sources and methodologies and report that caloric consumption does decline on
average around the time of retirement.

icy that elicits this aggregate (second-best) e¢ciency property, although signi cant deviations
from optimality will arise at the level of individual households, including sensitivity to default
savings.

Conclusion

We study a simple setting that illustrates the interactions between optimizing social planners
and heterogeneous households, some of whom are optimizers, some of whom are myopic, and
some of whom are passive. In this setting, planner optimization is a partial substitute for
household optimization. This substitution arises because the social planner has the ability to
design institutions  e.g., default savings and Social Security  that inuence the consumption
pro les of households. In equilibrium, classical Euler equations hold on average in the crosssection of households (but not for each household). These Euler equation properties arise
generally, whether or not households are optimizers.
These results imply that Euler equation tests and related consumption-smoothing tests 
e.g., the lack of an average drop in consumption at retirement  do not di¤erentiate between
an optimizing social planner and optimizing households. However, even in the economy that
we have studied, planner optimization is distinguishable, in principle, from household optimization. Under the assumption of household optimization, the Euler equation will hold for
each household, but, with planner optimization (and without universal household optimization), it will only hold on average in the cross section. Although household-by-household
tests are theoretically determinative, such ne-grained analysis is practically problematic if
data are measured with noise or if some variables are unobservable (e.g., household-level
taste shocks). Still, other tests do distinguish between planner optimization and household
optimization. Exogenous changes in policy (e.g., a default change at the level of a rm, or a
natural experiment in the Social Security system), reveal more about household rationality
than averages of observational data in the cross section.
Our conclusions depend upon the assumption that the government is a fully rational utilitarian. It is likely that esh-and-blood governments fall short of this benevolent benchmark,
26

despite (or because of) the pressures that they face to get re-elected. This leads to a natural
follow-up question: how would our results change if the government is not utilitarian, but
is instead a self-interested political party? The answer depends on two key considerations:
what is the voting frequency of di¤erent types of households and to what degree do altruistic
motives inuence voting? These are important extensions, which we leave for future research.

Proof of Lemma 1 (cD
1 ; i.e., sD > 0):
1 < c

First, we break the planners problem down into two separable sub-problems. In the rst
c1 and ignore the passives. In the second sub-problem, we

sub-problem, we solve for sF = y
solve for sF + sD (holding sF

xed from the rst sub-problem) and ignore both the myopes

and the optimizers. This separation of the two problems is only admissible if the resulting
optima, sF and sD ; satisfy an incentive compatibility (IC) constraint,
cD
1 ;
1 c

(IC)

which can also be expressed as

y

sF

sD  y

sF :

This constraint follows from the constraint sD  0 (equation (1)). At the end of this proof
we con rm that an even stronger condition applies: sD > 0; which is the claim in the lemma.
To summarize our strategy, we characterize optimal policy for the myopes and optimizers
 the minimum savings level sF  without taking account of optimal policy for the passives.
Then we characterize optimal policy for the passives  the sum sF + sD  holding xed the
policy parameter that inuences the myopes and optimizers, sF . At the end of the analysis
we verify that the constraint sD  0 is satis ed at the solution.
In the separated problem, the optimal level of c1 is given by the following Euler equation:

Z 
dc1 ()

We can rearrange this by grouping together the optimizer terms and the myope terms:
