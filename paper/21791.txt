A New Dilemma: Capital Controls and Monetary Policy in Sudden Stop Economies

NBER Working Paper No. 21791

JEL No. E44,E58,F38,F41
ABSTRACT
The dangers of high capital flow volatility and sudden stops have led economists to promote the use
of capital controls as an addition to monetary policy in emerging market economies. This paper studies
the benefits of capital controls and monetary policy in an open economy with financial frictions, nominal
rigidities, and sudden stops. We focus on a time-consistent policy equilibrium. We find that during
a crisis, an optimal monetary policy should sharply diverge from price stability. Without commitment,
policymakers will also tax capital inflows in a crisis. But this is not optimal from an ex-ante social
welfare perspective. An outcome without capital inflow taxes, using optimal monetary policy alone
to respond to crises, is superior in welfare terms, but not time-consistent. If policy commitment were
in place, capital inflows would be subsidized during crises. We also show that an optimal policy will
never involve macro-prudential capital inflow taxes as a precaution against the risk of future crises
(whether or not commitment is available).

Introduction
Recent experience of financial crises in many countries has altered the traditional support for fully

open international capital markets. Many emerging market economies have opened up their financial
markets in the last two decades and moved away from rigidly pegged exchange rates (see for instance LevyYeyati and Sturzenegger, 2005; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2008). Despite this move toward openness, these
countries have been subject to extremely volatile capital flows and crises associated with ‘sudden stops’ in
capital inflows (Bacchetta and van Wincoop, 2000; Kaminsky et al., 2005; Reinhart and Reinhart, 2009;
Fratzscher, 2012; Broner et al., 2013b). A new view has emerged suggesting that monetary policy alone
cannot adequately manage the external shocks facing small emerging economies and must be supplanted
with some type of capital control or macro-prudential policy (Farhi and Werning, 2012, 2014; Rey, 2015).
The central logic behind this recent consensus is that the welfare case for fully open capital markets
rests on a set of assumptions that fail to apply in contemporary international financial markets, so that
capital controls may constitute a second best optimal policy response. This new ‘orthodoxy’ promotes the
combination of capital controls and monetary policy as part of an optimal policy toolkit for open economies
(The Economist, 2013).
Our paper revisits the case for capital controls in open economies with both financial frictions and
nominal rigidities. We employ a simple model of a small open economy subject to occasional ‘sudden
stops’. Monetary policy and capital controls are potentially useful as macroeconomic instruments. We
ask two simple questions: first, how useful is monetary policy in responding to financial crises associated
with ‘sudden stops’ in capital flows, ; and second, what are the benefits of capital controls in addition to
monetary policy?
The combination of sticky prices and financial constraints that depend on asset prices offer the possibility that monetary policy and capital controls may be used in tandem as part of an optimal policy. A
substantial empirical and theoretical literature makes the case that financial frictions render conventional
monetary policy tools less effective (see Cespedes et al., 2004; Devereux et al., 2006; Gertler et al., 2007;
Braggion et al., 2009).1 At the same time, as we noted, a series of recent papers have noted the possibility that taxes on capital flows can correct pecuniary externalities associated with occasionally binding
borrowing constraints (Bianchi, 2011; Benigno et al., 2013; Bianchi and Mendoza, 2010, 2013; Jeanne and
1

Korinek, 2010). In principle, we might expect that these two policy levers would support each other as
part of an optimal policy package.
Before answering these questions, however, we place one further requirement on the policy design - we
assume that policymakers lack commitment ability, so that both monetary and macro prudential policies
have to be ‘time-consistent’ in the sense that previous policy promises will only be kept if they are in
the interests of current decision makers (Klein et al., 2008). Subject to this requirement, we explore the
combination of optimal monetary and capital controls policies in an environment with financial frictions
and a combination of both internal and external shocks.
The central results of the paper are two-fold and quite striking. First, we find that there is a role for
monetary policy to depart from the conventional optimal rule of maintaining strict price stability in face
of ‘sudden stop’ crises which lead to binding borrowing constraints in the baseline model. In such states
of the world, it is optimal for policy makers to provide some monetary stimulus and to allow a jump in
domestic inflation. The degree to which monetary policy can usefully respond to sudden stops depends
on how extensive are nominal rigidities - with sticky prices and wages, a highly active monetary policy is
both effective and optimal. Second, we find that in a time-consistent optimal policy equilibrium, policy
makers will find it optimal to impose capital inflow taxes in face of sudden stop crises. Such taxes will
relax the external borrowing constraint and partly cushion the economy from the negative impact of the
crises. But despite this positive effect, we find that capital controls are in fact welfare reducing. The time
consistent equilibrium in which policy makers apply capital controls leads to excessively low asset prices
and inefficiently low levels of net external debt accumulation by the small economy, relative to a policy
outcome without capital controls.
In an environment where the policymaker lacks commitment, there is no guarantee that optimal policies
maximize welfare, even if the policy-maker is purely benevolent. This observation is the same point that
was first made by Kydland and Prescott (1977), but is implicit in a vast literature on dynamic public
finance and macroeconomic models of monetary and fiscal policy.2 In our case, the key element underlying
the problem of time-consistency is attributable to the nature of the borrowing constraints facing the
small economy. As in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Iacoviello (2005), we assume that the collateral
constraint on borrowing is tied to the value of assets that obtains when the debt comes due. As a result,
2

For instance see time-consistent monetary policy in Calvo (1978) and Barro and Gordon (1983); time-consistent fiscal
policy in Benhabib and Rustichini (1997), Klein et al. (2008), Farhi et al. (2012) and others.

a policymaker who is concerned with macro prudential tools must focus on easing borrowing constraints
by targeting future asset prices. With full commitment in policy-making, this targeting would be done by
promising to take actions in the future. But in the absence of commitment, the only tool available is to
impose capital controls on current inflows in times of crises. In an equilibrium where all policymakers take
these actions, capital controls are excessive and the economy undertakes too little borrowing.
The message of the paper is clear. Capital flow controls present an appealing additional policy lever
for emerging market countries, particularly because they directly attack the sources of inefficiency in
international capital markets. But without commitment in policy making, capital controls involve a severe
problem of time inconsistency, leading to an outcome with excessive capital inflow taxes which is worse
than an outcome with unregulated (and inefficient) capital flows. While the new orthodoxy suggests that
in principle, capital controls may be a beneficial addition to policy, we argue that once we recognize the
strategic setting in which policy is made, capital controls are not desirable.
How would the analysis differ if policy-makers had the ability to commit to an optimal policy? While
we do not fully characterize the solution to the model under commitment, we show that an optimal policy
with commitment should imply a subsidy to capital inflows during a crisis. But without commitment, as
we have noted, capital inflows are taxed during a crisis.
Our analysis also has implications for the role of capital taxes as ‘macro-prudential’ policy. Should
capital inflows be taxed during normal times in order to reduce the severity of crises when the crisis
eventually hits? A number of recent papers have made the case for such macro prudential policy (see
for instance Korinek, 2011, Bianchi and Mendoza, 2013). In our model, surprisingly, we find that macro
prudential policy is never optimal, whether or not policy commitment is available.
This paper contributes to two growing branches of literature. First, it is related to the literature on
the remedies for pecuniary externalities. During a financial crisis, the collateral constraint binds, which
reduces the value of collateral, leading to an even tighter constraint, but private agents do not internalize
this effect when issuing debt. This may lead to over borrowing in competitive equilibrium, relative to a
social planner’s outcome (Bianchi, 2011).3 Bianchi and Mendoza (2010) show that state-contingent capital
inflow taxes will prevent overborrowing, which can be interpreted as a form of Pigouvian taxation (Jeanne
and Korinek, 2010). When there exist ex post adjustments of production between tradable and nontradable
3

The overborrowing result is relative to the allocation chosen by a constrained social planner or regulator that faces the
same borrowing constraint; relative to an unconstrained or first-best allocation, the economy in Bianchi (2011) generates
severe underborrowing.

3

sectors, the economy could exhibit underborrowing relative to the constrained efficient outcome (Benigno
et al., 2013). Korinek (2011) provides a comprehensive review on borrowing and macroprudential policies
during financial crises. As for optimal capital controls, Bianchi and Mendoza (2013) and Benigno et al.
(2012, 2014) explore time-consistent macroprudential policy.4
The most closely related paper to ours is Bianchi and Mendoza (2013). They also investigate the role
of optimal, time consistent capital controls in a model with occasionally binding constraints. Our paper is
distinguished from Bianchi and Mendoza (2013) in two dimensions. First of course we incorporate a useful
role for monetary policy. Second but more importantly, in our model, the constraint on borrowing depends
upon the expectation of the future (resale) value of assets, following the tradition of Kiyotaki and Moore
(1997) and Iacoviello (2005), whereas Bianchi and Mendoza (2013) use the current value of assets.5 The
different constraints lead to quite different incentives facing policymakers. Bianchi and Mendoza (2013),
identify an important role for a macro prudential tax; a capital inflow tax that is levied in good times, when
there is a positive probability of a binding constraint in the next period. Once a crisis occurs however,
the capital inflow tax is set close to zero. Moreover, this time consistent policy will always raise welfare in
their model. The reason is that a policymaker in their model needs to restrict capital inflows on the edge
of a crisis in order to sustain current asset prices, the value of collateral and access to international capital
market. By contrast we find that the policy maker will never use macro-prudential taxes - it is never
optimal to tax capital flows outside of a crisis. But when there is a sudden stop, the policy maker imposes
capital inflow controls to prop up the value of collateral assets in the future. But in an equilibrium, where
capital inflow controls are always used in a crisis, the price of capital and external borrowing are pushed
down so much that welfare is lower than that with unregulated capital markets.
Our paper is also related to recent studies exploring monetary policy in the context of financial crises.
Rey (2015) and Passari and Rey (2015) present evidence that the global financial cycle constrains monetary
policy even under the flexible exchange rate regime when capital flows are unrestricted, and recommend
the use of capital flow management. Bruno and Shin (2015a,b) provide a linkage between cross-border
bank capital flows and global factors, particularly US monetary policy. Farhi and Werning (2012, 2014)
4

Korinek and Simsek (2013) study an aggregate demand externality at the zero lower bound, wherein the inability of the
nominal interest rate to drop below zero when needed to stimulate consumption creates a positive role for macroprudential
policy. Since their paper is in a closed-economy setting the particular policies they advocate are quite different from ones that
would arise in our model. In any case, our economy does not encounter the ZLB given a reasonable inflation target, so we can
safely abstract from the issues they raise.
5
Either constraint can be motivated by an underlying microeconomic model of lending with limited enforcement. It is an
open question what type of constraint fits the data best.

investigate optimal capital controls and monetary policy in a Gali and Monacelli (2005) type of small open
economy model with risk premium shocks, and show that capital controls help restore monetary autonomy
in a fixed exchange rate regime and work as terms of trade manipulation in a flexible exchange rate regime.6
The most related papers on exchange rate policy are Fornaro (2015) and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2015).
Fornaro (2015) considers a small open economy similar to ours but focuses on simple policy rules, whereas
our paper investigates the optimal monetary policy and optimal capital controls. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2015) study a model with fixed exchange rates, downward nominal wage rigidity, and free capital mobility.
In their paper, a correctly scaled devaluation can eliminate the effects of wage rigidity. In contrast, our
paper starts with a standard small open economy New Keynesian model with sticky prices and/or wages.
The pecuniary externality arises from collateralized borrowing, which cannot be completely undone by
monetary policy. This opens the possibility of exploring the combination of monetary policy and capital
controls in our paper. The novel result of our paper is that while the case for the benefits of capital controls
as a supplement to monetary policy is present in our model, the end result is that the use of capital controls
leads to worse outcomes in equilibrium.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the baseline model with sticky prices and
characterizes the competitive equilibrium under a certain set of policy. Section 3 characterizes allocations
under optimal monetary policy and optimal capital controls. Section 4 provides a simplified finite-period
model and discusses the time-inconsistency problem in optimal capital controls. Section 5 calibrates the
model and section 6 quantitatively conducts the positive and normative analysis of the baseline model.
Section 7 extends the baseline model by allowing sticky prices and sticky wages. The last section concludes.

The model
We consider a monetary version of a small open economy akin to Mendoza (2010) and Cespedes, Chang

and Velasco (2004). There exist infinitely lived firm-households with a unit measure in a small country.
Competitive domestic firms import intermediate inputs and hire domestic labor and physical capital to
produce wholesale goods. These wholesale goods are differentiated into various varieties by domestic
monopolistically competitive final goods producers, which are then aggregated by competitive bundlers
into consumption composites. These composites either are consumed by domestic households or exported

only foreign currency denominated, non-state contingent bonds with foreigners.
Wholesale good production takes a form of Cobb-Douglas production

Similar to Mendoza (2010), households can borrow from abroad to finance consumption and imported
intermediate inputs. Borrowing must be undertaken in foreign currency.8 Borrowing from abroad requires

stands for domestic savings in dollar terms at the end of period t. The term τN,t captures the presence

of a fiscal tax on intermediate imports, which is discussed below. Hence YF,t PF,t
N,t ) represents the

total expenditure on intermediate inputs in terms of the foreign good, and ϑ measures the fraction of
imported inputs YF,t which are financed in advance. Qt+1 denotes the nominal capital price in domestic
currency units, and kt+1 is the capital that the household accumulates in period t. The parameter κt
characterizes the loan-to-value ratio in the spirit of Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). The interpretation of (5)
is that the collateralized expected foreign currency value of the capital stock brought into the next period
must be at least as great as the foreign currency value of household intertemporal borrowing plus the
working capital loans that households take out within period t to finance intermediate imports.
Firm-households are equal owners of domestic firms and consequently they make identical consumption
and borrowing decisions. We write the decisions for the wholesale good producer explicitly. The determination of other factors and products can be obtained from the maximum of the representative firm’s profits
in the corresponding competitive factor and product markets, which are omitted in the firm-household’s
budget constraint. The representative firm-household faces the budget constraint

Empirical evidence shows that emerging economies borrow primarily in foreign currency from international investors (for
instance see, Jeanne, 2003) and do so using short term bonds (see Broner, Lorenzoni and Schmukler, 2013a). In the literature
this situation is called ‘liability dollarization’ and plays an important role in the financial accelerator that leads to sudden
stops in our model. If bonds were denominated in local currency, during a sudden stop the value of outstanding debt would
fall and mitigate the effects of the crisis.

The left-hand side of the equation displays consumption expenditures Pt ct , purchases of capital Qt kt+1 ,

and in dollars Bt+1

Farhi and Werning, 2014), we assume that the government subsidizes foreign bond purchases at the rate of
τc,t . Hence τc,t > 0 is equivalent to a tax on foreign borrowing (if τc,t is negative this represents a subsidy
to foreign borrowing). The right-hand side shows various income sources, including labor income Wt lt ,
(Wt is the nominal wage) gross return on capital kt (RK,t + Qt ), (RK,t is the marginal product of capital)
gross return on domestic bond holdings Bt , foreign savings Bt∗ Et , lump-sum transfers from government

other firms Dt . As noted above, we assume that wholesale producers are taxed by the fiscal authorities on
their purchases of imported intermediate inputs at rate τN,t . This tax is designed to exploit the country’s
implicit monopoly power in its export good, and is explicitly derived in the Appendix C.9 The wholesale
good production Mt is given by equation (1). We assume that working capital loans incur no interest rate
payments as in Bianchi and Mendoza (2013).
Let µt et be the Lagrange multiplier associated with the collateral constraint (5). Let a lower case price
variable denote the real price, i.e., qt = Qt /Pt , wt = Wt /Pt . The consumer price index inflation rate
is defined as πt = Pt /Pt−1 and the real exchange rate (also the terms of trade) et = Et Pt∗ /Pt . Higher
et implies depreciation of the real exchange rate. We can derive the first order conditions for household
optimality as follows. The optimality condition for labor supply reads

wt = χltν .

We see this assumption as essentially technical, designed to isolate the terms of trade externality from the pecuniary
externality specific to the borrowing constraints. In the analysis below, τN,t will be set at a level so that in normal times, the
policy authorities have no further incentive to manipulate the economy’s terms of trade.

where Uc (t) denotes the marginal utility of consumption. Condition (8) says that in choosing to acquire
an additional unit of capital, the household trades off the cost of the capital against the expected benefit
in terms of the returns and capital gains next period, adjusted by the stochastic discount factor, and in
addition, there is a current benefit in terms of a looser borrowing constraint when µt > 0, which depends
on the expected next period price of capital. Condition (10) indicates that the cost of purchasing a foreign
∗
currency bond (1 − τc,t )/Rt+1
must be weighed against the expected benefit next period in terms of the

discounted return, plus the additional benefit which comes from a looser borrowing constraint when µt > 0.
The optimal demand for intermediate inputs, labor, and capital for the wholesale firm-household is
given implicitly by

Note that (11) implies that the cost to the household-firm of importing intermediate inputs is increasing
in the real exchange rate (which is also equivalent to the terms of trade in this setting) and also increasing
in the multiplier on the collateral constraint µt . Since intermediate inputs must be partially financed by
borrowing, a tightening of the collateral constraint increases the real cost of importing for the firm. wt
denotes the real cost of labor faced by a firm.

Final good producers

There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive final good producers with measure one, each of
which differentiates wholesale goods into a variety of final goods. Varieties are imperfect substitutes, and

9

final good producers have a monopoly power over their varieties. All consumption varieties are aggregated
into a consumption composite via a CES aggregator with elasticity of substitution θ.
Let Pt (i) be the price of variety Yt (i). Cost minimization implies that the price for the consumption
composite can be written as

Firms set prices in terms of domestic currency (whether for domestic sales or export). They can reset
their prices each period but suffer an asymmetric price adjustment cost. Profits per period gained by firm

In a symmetric equilibrium, all firms choose the same price, Pt (i) = Pt , when resetting their prices.

Market clearing conditions

The labor market clearing condition implies that lt = Lt . Per capita consumption must equal total
consumption, so that ct = Ct . If we assume that foreigners don’t hold domestic currency denominated
bonds, then the domestic bond market equilibrium requires bt+1 = 0.
The capital stock is in fixed supply. The domestic capital market clearing condition yields Kt+1 =

Competitive equilibrium

A competitive equilibrium consists of a sequence of allocations {Lt , Ct , YF,t , Yt , Kt+1 , b∗t+1 }, and a
sequence of prices {wt , qt , µt , Rt+1 , rK,t , et , πt , pM,t }, for t = · · · , 0, 1, 2, · · · , given fiscal subsidies τH
and τN,t , monetary policy Rt+1 and capital inflow policy τc,t chosen by the fiscal authority and monetary
authority, such that (a) allocations solve households and firms’ problem given the public policy and (b)
prices clear corresponding markets. The full set of conditions for a competitive equilibrium is set out in
Appendix A.

Optimal policy

3.1

Optimal monetary policy

We first explore the environment where the policy-maker’s options are restricted solely to monetary
policy. The monetary authority solves a Ramsey planner’s problem to maximize a representative household’s lifetime utility. The optimal policy is implemented only by a monetary policy instrument; e.g. the
nominal interest rate, within a regime of flexible exchange rates. Here we focus on the time-consistent
optimal policy under discretion and look for a Markov-perfect equilibrium.11 The current planner takes as
given the decisions of future planners but internalizes how those choices depend on the future debt level
b∗t+1 chosen today.
Assume that the constant subsidy rate τH is set at τH = 1/(θ − 1) to undo the monopoly power of
differentiated producers in an economy without uncertainty. Likewise, we assume that the export tax is
set at the rate τN,t = 1/(ρ − 1) to offset the terms of trade monopoly.12 The monetary authority chooses
the paths for inflation rates πt to maximize a representative household’s life-time utility. Let the value
function for a representative domestic firm-household be V (b∗t , Zt ) where Zt represents the set of exogenous
state variables. The problem faced by the government reads,
V (b∗t , Zt ) = max U (C̃t ) + βEt V (b∗t+1 , Zt+1 ), with C̃t ≡ Ct − χ

subject to the set of competitive equilibrium conditions from Appendix A.

3.2

Optimal monetary and capital control policies

We now contrast the above problem with an expanded policy menu where the policy maker chooses
both monetary policy and a policy for capital flow taxes. Again assume that the constant subsidy rate τH is
set at τH = 1/(θ − 1) to undo the monopoly power in an economy without uncertainty and that an optimal
export tax τN,t = 1/(ρ − 1) is in place. Focus again on the time-consistent optimal Markov/Ramsey policy
11

under discretion. But we now allow the optimal policy to be implemented both by a monetary policy
instrument and a capital inflow tax τc,t . The problem facing the planner with the option of capital taxes
is equivalent to the optimal monetary policy problem except that the Euler equation for foreign bonds is
omitted as a constraint. Then, given the solution to the extended planners problem, the optimal capital
inflow tax τc,t can then be inferred from the condition

A simplified example
Before we present the solution to the full model, it is instructive to examine a simple finite-horizon

example to build intuition for the results in the quantitative model. We assume a common world good,
so there is no terms of trade movement, all prices are perfectly flexible, so there is no scope for monetary
policy, and no monopolistic competition in domestic retail production, allowing us to ignore the distortion
due to markup pricing. Our focus is solely on the comparison of capital inflow taxes/subsidies with and
without commitment, when borrowing is restricted by collateral constraints.
There are only four time periods t = 0, 1, 2, 3. In period t = 0, 1, household borrowing has to be
collateralized by domestic physical capital, whose values are endogenously determined by domestic markets.
In period t = 2, borrowing also is restricted by a collateral requirement but the value of collateral is
exogenously given. In period t = 3, no borrowing is undertaken, so there is no collateral constraint.
The advantage of allowing an exogenous credit limit in period t = 2 is that the ‘financial accelerator’
operates only in the first two periods t = 0, 1. In the last period t = 3, households repay all outstanding debt
and consume all remaining income, so production, imports, labor supply and production are determined
independently of credit conditions, and given production income, consumption only depends on the the
level of debt inherited from period t = 2. Physical capital depreciates completely after production in
the last period. The structure of the model implies that decisions in the last two periods pin down the
capital price in period t = 1. Finally, the policy instrument available to a social planner is a capital inflow
tax/subsidy τc,t .
The model here is a finite period special case of the main model of section 2. The representative

14

firm-household has utility defined by

t=0

The budget constraints for periods t = 0, 1, 2 are given by

qt kt+1 + ct +

b∗t+1
(1 − τc,t ) = qt kt + b∗t + [AF (kt , lt , YF,t ) − p∗F YF,t ] + Tt , t = 0, 1, 2
R∗

and budget constraint in the last period t = 3 is
c3 = b∗3 + [AF (k3 , l3 , YF,3 ) − p∗F YF,3 ]

The household faces a collateral constraint in the first two periods analogous to those described in the
main model.
κt Et (qt+1 kt+1 ) ≥ −b∗t+1 + ϑp∗F YF,t , t = 0, 1
In period t = 2, the collateral constraint is described by:
κt q̄ ≥ −b∗t+1 + ϑp∗F YF,t , t = 2
where q̄ is constant and defined in Appendix B. The initial debt condition b∗0 is fixed.
The social planner chooses a capital flow tax/subsidy τc,t and returns the revenue accrued to the
household with a lump-sum transfer. In period t = 2, there is no benefit to a capital tax, so the planner
will choose τc,2 = 0.
We compare outcomes where policymakers can commit to a sequence of capital flow taxes/subsidies at
t = 0 to one where policy is made with discretion recursively at times t = 1 and t = 0. It is also revealing
to define a first-best outcome where borrowing may be undertaken without any financial frictions at all.
The Appendix B describes the detailed conditions which define each policy outcome.
We assume that households have an incentive to front-load consumption; i.e. βR∗ < 1. In addition,
assume perfect foresight, so all shocks are known at time t = 0. In the first best equilibrium, production,
income and employment are constant because of GHH preferences. Any pre-existing debt is paid down
over time. Since βR∗ < 1, in the first-best equilibrium, household consumption decreases over time as well.
In the competitive equilibrium, with zero capital taxes, κt and initial debt are set so that the borrowing
15

constraint binds for period t = 0, 1, 2.

13

Figure 1 illustrates the solution to the finite period model in the competitive equilibrium with zero
capital taxes, compared to the first best outcome. The economy begins with initial assets b∗0 = −0.2, and
debt must be zero at the end of period t = 3, so in all cases, debt must be drawn down before the end
period. In the first best case, labor supply, imported intermediates and output are constant across periods,
and effective consumption has a slight downward sloping profile. Debt is reduced evenly across periods
and is zero at the end of period t = 3. The price of capital starts high and falls smoothly over time, since
capital is worth nothing in the last period.
In a competitive equilibrium, households cannot issue new debt in the amount required to sustain the
first-best consumption path. As a result, the collateral constraints become binding, effective consumption
is constrained, and labor supply and output are below the first-best level. The binding collateral constraint
reduces the household’s equilibrium discount factor, and pushes down the profile of asset prices, leading to
a further tightening of the debt constraints through the debt-deflation process. Figure 1 shows that in the
competitive equilibrium with binding constraints, the consumption profile is sharply upward sloping, the
Lagrange multiplier on the collateral constraint is positive and falling over time, leading to an inefficiently
low level of labor supply, imported intermediates, and output. Since the collateral constraint is gradually
relaxed, output and both inputs rise over time until at t = 3 they attain their first-best level. The asset
price falls below that of the first-best in all periods.14
With commitment, the planner in period t = 0 can choose a sequence of consumption, borrowing,
employment and imported inputs to maximize household utility for t = 0, 1, 2, 3, constrained by the
collateral constraints, the firm-households profit maximization conditions, and the pricing equation for the
capital stock. This last equation can be represented as follows for periods t = 0, 1 and t = 2, respectively:

Uc (t + 1)
(rK,t+1 + qt+1 ) + µt κt Et {qt+1 } , t = 0, 1

We set the leverage parameter to κt = 0.4 for t = 0, 1, 2 and initial assets b∗0 = −0.2. Structural parameter values
are the same as those in the infinite-period model (see table 3) except that αF = 0.16 and ϑ = 0.5, which will be described
in detail later. The parameter governing the share of working capital is set to ϑ = 0.5, which is much lower than that in
the infinite-period model. The reason is that the capital price in the four-period model is much lower than that in the full
dynamic model. The import share is set to αF = 0.16, and αK = 1 − αF − αL , to make the graphs more visible. Alternative
parameterizations do not change the qualitative results.
14
Katagiri, Kato and Tsuruga (2013) show that in this model the optimal policy is to intervene to set the multiplier equal
to zero in any period in which it would otherwise be positive; that policy is time-consistent and implements the first-best
allocation. The size of the required interventions may be prohibitive for real economies where other constraints on policymakers
may become relevant; the size of the required transfers gets larger as the economy approaches the natural debt limit.

The planner attempts to relax the collateral constraint so as to flatten the time profile of effective
consumption, relative to that of the competitive equilibrium. To achieve this goal, the planner needs to
raise q1 , since this is the asset price governing the first period collateral constraint. This can be done
by raising the equilibrium discount factor for t = 1, through a capital inflow subsidy applied in period
t = 1. The easing of the collateral constraint leads to a fall in the Lagrange multiplier for t = 0, which
encourages increased period t = 0 consumption, relative to period t = 1 consumption. Since the optimal
policy requires maintaining high period t = 1 consumption relative to t = 2 consumption, the planner
balances the capital inflow subsidy in period t = 1 with an inflow tax in period t = 0 (see the upper panel
of table 1).
Figure 2 describes the full response of the economy in the commitment outcome. The pattern is nonmonotonic. Since an optimal policy to ease collateral involves subsidizing period t = 1 consumption, the
collateral constraint binds more tightly at t = 1 relative to the competitive equilibrium, while it is relaxed
in period t = 0 (relative to the competitive equilibrium). As a result, output and inputs rise relative to the
initial competitive equilibrium in the first period, but fall in the second period. But the policy is successful
at moving the consumption profile more in the direction of the first best outcome and leads to a uniformly
higher price of capital.
Under discretion, the planner sets the capital control conditional on the state in each period (here
the level of borrowing and exogenous shocks). Unlike the case with commitment, the planner ignores the
impact of current policy on past planner decisions. Given debt levels at period t = 1, the planner will
choose allocations to maximize the representative agent’s welfare from t = 1 onwards. Then, taking the
policy functions implied by the planner’s decisions at t = 1 as given, the planner in t = 0 will choose an
optimal allocation for t = 0.
Figure 2 describes the time path of the relevant variables under the discretionary policy as described
above. Again, the planner would like to maximize welfare of the representative agent by tilting the
effective consumption profile more to the present, relative to that in the competitive equilibrium. But
without commitment, the time t = 1 capital flow policy cannot be credibly determined by the planner at
time t = 0. Rather, the time t = 1 policy is chosen by the planner at time t = 1, taking the time t = 1
level of external debt and the currently binding collateral constraint as given. From the perspective of

Notes: The collateral constraint takes a form of κt qt kt+1 ≥ −b∗t+1 + ϑp∗F YF,t
with t = 0, 1 as in Bianchi and Mendoza (2011, 2013). Welfare is measured by
the certainty equivalence of effective consumption.

time t = 1, the planner wishes to relax the t = 1 constraint. Any policy which targets the q1 price will not
directly affect the time t = 1 collateral constraint. Rather, the planner at time t = 1 attempts to increase
the asset price q2 by imposing a capital inflow tax, reducing the level of debt brought into period t = 2.
By increasing the equilibrium discount factor, for any initial level of debt −b∗1 that the time t = 1 planner
is faced with, she can raise q2 by reducing the debt level brought into period 2. So, instead of subsidizing
capital inflows in period 1, as the full commitment policy would do, the time consistent planner taxes
inflows at time 1.
The time t = 0 policy can then be computed from the perspective of the planner at time 0, taking as
given the actions of the time t = 1 planner. Again, the optimal policy for the t = 0 planner is to attempt
to raise q1 . But she cannot do raise q1 now by committing to a capital subsidy in time t = 1, since she
doesn’t have this commitment ability. The optimal time consistent policy is to impose an even slightly
higher capital inflow tax in time t = 0 than that under commitment, which again by raising the equilibrium
discount factor, increases the the asset price q1 .

20

When we put together the time path of capital taxes in the time consistent policy profile, we see,
remarkably, that the optimal policy under discretion leads to an effective consumption profile which is in
fact steeper than that of the untaxed competitive equilibrium, with a profile of borrowing for t = 0 and
t = 1 that is lower than the competitive equilibrium. The optimal policy under discretion exacerbates the
degree to which the collateral constraints restrict the household’s borrowing profile. Another way to see
this result is to note that the asset price at time t = 1, which determines the initial borrowing level, and
the time profile of consumption, is lower than that under commitment and also (marginally) lower than
that in a competitive equilibrium.
Hence, a lack of commitment can lead to a capital control policy outcome that is not just ineffective,
but is perverse, resulting in a time profile of consumption, asset prices and debt that is further away from
the efficient level than would be a constrained competitive equilibrium without any policy at all. The
bottom panel of table 1 establishes this result in terms of welfare: relative to the competitive equilibrium,
welfare is higher under commitment and lower under discretion.
It is instructive to compare these results to those that would apply if collateral were valued at the
current price qt (as in Bianchi and Mendoza, 2013, for instance), rather than the expected price tomorrow
Et [qt+1 ].15 . Table 2 presents the results for optimal capital taxes with this alternative collateral constraint.
Capital controls and welfare under discretion are almost the same as those under commitment in this case.
Under discretion, the policymaker at period t = 1 wants to relax the credit constraint by increasing the
asset price in that period, q1 . Subsidizing capital inflows can increase consumption in that period, which
in turn leads to a higher current asset price. This capital inflow subsidy is essentially equivalent to that
which would be chosen in period t = 0 under commitment.16

parameters are quite standard and taken from the literature. In normal times without a binding constraint,

The fact that kt rather than kt+1 serves as collateral in Bianchi and Mendoza (2013) does not make a significant difference,
since the only difference is whether a particular term is multiplied by β.

Note that Bianchi and Mendoza (2013) primarily focus on macroprudential policy, which requires capital flow taxes
applied in periods before financial distress occurs. We discuss the relevance of macroprudential taxes in our model below.

optimal inflation equals its target. Therefore, domestic nominal interest rates reflect domestic real interest
rates. We set the subjective discount factor β = 0.975, in line with the literature for emerging economies
(Uribe and Yue, 2006; Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007), implying an annual real interest rate of 10%. Relative
risk aversion is set to σ = 2 and the inverse of Frisch labor supply elasticity is ν = 1.
The leverage shock κt determines the borrowing capacity in a country. We take a two-state Markov
chain to capture the leverage shock: κL = 0.35 and κH = 0.5. These two states are consistent with the
leverage change from pre-crisis period to crisis period for US nonfinancial corporations (Graham, Leary and
Roberts, 2014) and the corporate leverages in Asian emerging economies (IMF, 2014).17 The transition

We set pL,L = 0.775 and pH,H = 0.975 such that the duration of a high leverage regime equals 40 quarters
and the unconditional probability of a low leverage regime is 10% (Bianchi and Mendoza, 2013), implying
that a typical leverage crisis will happen every ten years.
Parameters in the production function are set to match imports share (15% of GDP, see Hanson,
2012), labor share (65% of GDP, see Mendoza, 2010) and the external debt-GDP ratio (40%) in emerging
economies before the Global Financial Crisis.18 Given the leverage specification above and relevant ratios,
we set αF = 0.13, αL = 0.57 and αK = 0.03. Parameter ϑ is set to 1.3, implying a share of working
capital 20% of GDP (Mendoza, 2010).19 The equilibrium labor supply in normal times (without credit
constraints) is normalized to be one, which implies that χ = 0.4.
Nominal rigidity is introduced through a Rotemberg price adjustment cost. Price adjustment takes
around four quarters. We set φP = 76 as in Aruoba, Cuba-Borda and Schorfheide (2013), and assume a
small downward price rigidity γ = −100.20 Following the new Keynesian literature (Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 2005; Gali, 2015), we set the elasticity of varieties in both domestic and foreign con17

Mendoza (2010) uses a similar leverage κt = 0.2 and κt = 0.3 in his analysis.
Data from World Development Indicators show that, just before the onset of the Global Financial Crisis, many emerging
economies accumulated a large amount of external debt stocks, around 40% of Gross National Income. Data source: World
Development Indicators with indicator code: DT.DOD.DECT.GN.ZS.
19
Note that ϑ captures the role of working capital only when credit constraints bind. This value is higher than Mendoza
(2010) and Bianchi and Mendoza (2013), but is consistent with Uribe and Yue (2006).
20
The Rotemberg price adjustment cost relates the Calvo price stickiness via φP = α(θ −1)/((1−α)(1−αβ)) in an economy
without collateral constraints (Khan, 2005). 1 − α measures the probability of Calvo style price adjustment in each period.
Empricial evidence shows that prices rise faster than fall (Peltzman, 2000) and small price increases occur more frequently
than small price decreases for price changes (Chen, Levy, Ray and Bergen, 2008).

The real exchange rate is normalized to be one in a deterministic steady state when the collateral
constraint binds, which requires ζt∗ = 0.101. Domestic productivity and the foreign interest rate each
follow an AR(1) process:
ln(At+1 ) = (1 − ρA ) ln(A) + ρA ln(At ) + A,t+1
∗
ln(Rt+1
) = (1 − ρR ) ln(R∗ ) + ρR ln(Rt∗ ) + R,t+1

where mean productivity is normalized to be one A = 1 and the world quarterly real interest rate R∗ = 1.015
(Mendoza, 2010). We assume that the local productivity shock is uncorrelated with the global liquidity
shock.21 Following the literature (i.e., Backus, Kehoe and Kydland, 1992), we set the standard deviation
of the productivity shock to σA = 0.008 and its persistence to ρA = 0.95. The standard deviation of the
foreign interest rate is set to σR = 0.00623 and its persisence ρR = 0.60 (Rudebusch, 2002, 2006). We
then discretize the continuous AR(1) process into a two-state Markov chain based on Tauchen and Hussey
(1991) in the computation of the model.22

5.2

Solution method

We solve the model using time iteration, as in Coleman (1990) and Benigno et al. (2013). When
necessary, we use a homotopy algorithm to solve the system of nonlinear equations (Eaves and Schmedders,
1999; Devereux and Yu, 2014). To solve the Ramsey problems we follow Benigno et al. (2012, 2014) and
solve the nonlinear optimization problem using feasible sequential quadratic programming.23 All functions
are approximated using B-splines. The Appendix G provides details about the algorithms solving the
model.

21

Allowing for correlated shocks would slightly change households’ precautionary savings but would not alter the main
messages in this paper.
22
Adding additional states into the Markov chain alters the quantitative answers but not the qualitative ones.

specifically, we use the NLPQLP routine developed by Schittkowski (2014), who we thank for providing the code.

Results

6.1

Competitive equilibrium with strict inflation targeting

We first assume a simple policy rule whereby the central bank sets inflation equal to the target: i.e.
a price stability rule. This rule is equivalent to the Taylor rule described above with a very high weight
on inflation deviations from target.24 In order to put the policy comparisons on an equal basis, we also
assume that in the competitive equilibrium with strict inflation targeting, the fiscal authority imposes the
constant taxes described above to correct the distortions due to monopoly power and the terms-of-trade
manipulation.25
The model exhibits the characteristics of Fisherian debt-deflation described in previous literature. A
leverage shock that causes the collateral constraint to bind leads to a spike in µt , forcing debt to fall,
leading also to a fall in import demand, output, and current and expected future asset prices. This in turn
exacerbates the shock by further tightening the collateral constraint.
These responses to a leverage shock are described in the Figure 3, which illustrates the policy mapping
from initial debt levels to the endogenous variables of the model, conditional on different shock outcomes.
The Figure illustrates the effect of a shift from the best shock to the worst shock, given the existing level
of assets b∗t .26 The panels of the Figure show the outcomes for current asset prices, the real exchange rate,
the Lagrange multiplier and borrowing. We see that both qt and Et (qt+1 /et+1 ) declines sharply when b∗t is
in the region where the constraint binds. In each panel we see that the collateral constraint is substantially
more likely to bind, for given b∗t , for the worst shock states. As the collateral constraint becomes binding,
there is a kink in the policy function. For instance, given the realization of κt a fall in b∗t which precipitates
a binding constraint causes the mapping b∗t+1 (b∗t ) to become flatter, as the collateral constraint reduces the
borrowing capacity of the economy. By contrast, the mapping from b∗t to production and output becomes
steeper, as the binding collateral constraint increases the effective cost of imports.
What role does the real exchange rate play in the dynamics? From Figure 3, we see that as debt
24
While not optimal as defined by the time-consistent Ramsey problem, this rule is useful as a comparison since it represents
an optimal monetary policy in a wide variety of modern new Keynesian settings both in closed and open economies (e.g. Gali,
2015)
25
Thus, we are not considering the incentive to use monetary policy to substitute for these taxes, as is done by Costinot,
Lorenzoni and Werning (2014). It seems clear that such a substitution is welfare-reducing, since the nominal interest rate is
being put to a task it is not suited ideally to perform; instead, it is optimal to give the government an additional tool.

The ‘best shock’ refers to scenarios when domestic households face low foreign interest rate, high domestic productivity
and high domestic leverage, while the ‘worst shock’ is the case with high foreign interest rate, low domestic productivity and
low domestic leverage.

increases, for a given exogenous state, the economy experiences continued real exchange rate depreciation.
Intuitively, given higher initial debt levels, the path of consumption must be lower and lower, and in
order to replace this fall in demand for domestic goods, the real exchange rate must depreciate. This is
associated with a gradual fall in intermediate imports, employment and output. As debt rises above the
threshold where the collateral constraint binds, there is a sharper fall in consumption, and a much steeper
relationship between debt and the real exchange rate. The real exchange rate depreciation leads to a larger
fall in imported intermediates, exacerbating the negative impact of the binding borrowing constraint.
But the real exchange rate plays an additional role with respect to the borrowing constraint. As we
noted above, the one period ahead expected value Et (qt+1 /et+1 ) begins to decline sharply as external debt
approaches the point where the collateral constraint is likely to bind. An expectation that the collateral
constraint will bind in the immediate future must also imply an anticipated sharp future real exchange
rate depreciation (as explained below), which leads to a tightening of the present collateral constraint.
We can see the dynamics of a crisis in Figure 4, which presents a consecutive five-period window
of ‘event analysis’, where the event is defined in the following way: collateral constraints don’t bind in
the first two periods t = −2, −1, only bind at period t = 0 and there are no restrictions on collateral
constraints in the last two periods t = 1, 2. As the constraint binds in period 0 there is a sharp rise of the
Lagrange multiplier µ0 , which precipitates a persistent decline in foreign debt and a steep fall in imported
intermediates, labor, output, and consumption. The price of capital also falls sharply, and as noted, there
is a substantial real exchange rate depreciation.

6.2

Optimal monetary policy

The analysis so far assumed that monetary policy follows a strict inflation targeting rule, whether the
economy is in crisis or not (whether the collateral constraint is binding or not). We now explore the time
consistent Ramsey optimal monetary policy in the model with occasionally binding collateral constraints.
As described in sub-section 3.1 above, for now, we focus attention solely on the use of a monetary policy
instrument (e.g. the nominal interest rate), assuming no possibility for a capital flow tax.
Figures 5 describe the equilibrium policy functions for the time consistent Ramsey equilibrium (we also
include the competitive equilibrium with strict inflation targeting for contrast). Again the Figure describes
the equilibrium mapping from net foreign assets to the endogenous variables, conditional on different values
for the leverage shocks, but now rather than representing the competitive equilibrium, this represents the
28

mapping implied by the optimal monetary rule. When the collateral constraint is not binding (in the
Figure this requires that b∗t ≥ −0.217(−0.385) for the worst (best) shock) the optimal monetary rule is
identical to the strict inflation targeting competitive equilibrium. The inflation rate is maintained strictly
equal to the target rate independent of the realization of the leverage shock.27
As debt rises above the these thresholds however, so that the collateral constraint is binding, we see
that monetary policy does diverge from the strict inflation targeting rule. Figure 5 shows that in the case
of the worst (best) shock realization, as b∗t falls below −0.217(−0.385) the policy maker raises the inflation
rate above zero, and inflation rises monotonically with the level of external debt. Given the aggregate
Philips curve implied by the price setting equation (17), the rise in inflation provides a stimulus offsetting
the negative aggregate demand effects of the leverage shock. As Figure 5 shows, intermediate imports,
employment, and total output fall by less under the optimal monetary policy than under the strict inflation
targeting policy.
In the event analysis, which is not reported here, we compare the events under an optimal monetary
policy and under the strict inflation targeting policy. The main difference between the two is that output,
employment and intermediate imports fall by less under an optimal monetary policy. But since the crisis
is not persistent, this difference has a negligible effect of the response of domestic consumption relative
to the inflation targeting policy. Likewise, the real exchange rate and the price of capital respond almost
identically under an optimal monetary policy as under the inflation targeting rule. We conclude from this
result and from the fact that outside the crisis period optimal monetary policy adheres to strict inflation
targeting that, under this specification for price nominal rigidities, while optimal monetary policy should
depart from inflation targeting during a crisis, it does so simply to provide an aggregate demand stimulus.
Monetary policy plays no clear macro-prudential role, neither by attempting to tighten so as to reduce
debt accumulation before the crisis, nor to ease the degree to which the borrowing constraint is binding
during the crisis (to see this last point note that the Lagrange multiplier response under strict inflation
targeting is essentially equivalent to the response under an optimal monetary policy during the crisis).

This statement is not trivial. Although the leverage constraint does not bind when b∗t satisfies the conditions stated in the
previous sentence, the shocks are persistent, and it could be the case that a severe leverage shock combined with a debt level
close to the threshold would precipitate a response of monetary policy designed to reduce the risk future binding constraints.

Optimal monetary and capital controls

We now combine monetary policy with capital controls, where the policy-maker may employ capital
inflow controls with monetary policy responses. Before analyzing the full solution to the time-consistent
Ramsey problem with capital controls, we ask what incentive would the planner have to employ capital
inflow controls, in addition to utilizing optimal monetary policy as described above. To understand these
incentives, we display one of the first order conditions from the Ramsey problem without nominal rigidities
as follows (see Appendix D):

1 = βEt

∂(qt+1 /et+1 )
−1 + (ρ − 1)κt Et
.
ρ
∂b∗t+1

The first condition may be interpreted as follows. The left hand side measures the cost of increasing
saving this period (accumulating net foreign assets) in terms of the foreign good. The right hand side
measures the benefits which are three-fold. First, there is the increase in net wealth brought into the next
period, which increases utility through an increase in consumption. Second, there is the benefit to private
households in terms of relaxing the current collateral constraint, measured by the second expression on
the right hand side. The third expression, denoted τc,t , decomposed in the second equation, captures the
net additional benefit to foreign assets perceived by the planner, and thus represents the incentive for the
planner to intervene directly in capital flows. We see this comprises of two parts, one negative, and one
positive. Thus, in principle, the planner may wish to set a negative or positive tax on capital inflows, or
equivalently, to subsidize or tax foreign borrowing. Moreover, the relative strength of the two components
depends on the foreign elasticity of demand for home exports ρ. With a very low elasticity, it is more likely
that τc,t < 0, so that foreign borrowing is subsidized. But as ρ rises, given that Et (∂(qt+1 /et+1 )/∂b∗t+1 ) > 0,
it is more likely that τc,t > 0.
To understand the logic behind these two components, take the first component. This arises due to
the presence of the constant import tax 1 + τN designed to offset the terms of trade externality. With a
constant import tax, private households face a different marginal benefit of an additional unit of borrowing
than does the planner. When the collateral constraint binds, private households perceive an additional

31

unit of debt has an excess cost µt /et in terms of domestic consumption. But the planner facing the same
calculation takes into account that an additional unit of debt will increase consumption by et (1 + τN ),
which is the marginal product of intermediate imports in production. So the planner’s excess cost of debt
is evaluated as µt /(et (1 + τN )), which is less than that of the private sector. For this reason alone, the
planner would wish to subsidize borrowing. The lower is ρ, the elasticity of foreign demand for domestic
exports, the higher is τN , and the higher is the motivation to subsidize foreign borrowing.
Against this, however, is the fact that when the collateral constraint binds, the planner will wish to
take actions to relax the constraint. She can do this by increasing net foreign assets brought into the next
)/∂b∗t+1 > 0. This effect depends on the
period, thereby increasing period t + 10 s capital price, since ∂( eqt+1
t+1
planner explicitly taking account of the equilibrium mapping from net foreign assets to future asset prices,
which is implicit in the time-consistent policy choice. These choices in turn relax the collateral constraint
in the current period. Since this margin is not taken into account by private households, the desire to raise
period t + 1 capital price through this channel leads the planner to impose a capital inflow tax when the
period t collateral constraint binds.
In the calibrated model below, we find that the second factor is always dominant, so that the time
consistent planner will always impose a capital inflow tax, when µt > 0.28
We now summarize the outcome under optimal capital controls under discretion in the following proposition.
Proposition 1. When ρ is large enough, τc,t > 0 if µt > 0 under discretion.
Note that the planner ignores the impact of a capital tax on the current asset price qt , since this has
no direct bearing on the planner’s problem.29 . We can formally show that the planner will never impose a
tax at time t unless the constraint is currently binding, even under commitment; that is, capital controls
are never prudential in the sense of Jeanne and Korinek (2013).
Proposition 2. If µt = 0, then τc,t = 0 .
Proof. See Appendix E.
28

With nominal rigidities, the expression for τc,t becomes more complicated; nevertheless, the quantitative results show that
optimal inflation is essentially equal to its target and price stickiness doesn’t matter for optimal capital controls. Therefore,
τc,t defined in the main text can capture the driving forces in the baseline model with nominal rigidities. When both wages
and prices are sticky, as in section 7 , the issue becomes more complex. Nevertheless, the quantitative solutions still lead to
capital inflow taxes in states where the collateral constraint binds.

33

The intuition for this result depends on whether the planner has commitment or not, but the result
holds in either case. Suppose the constraint is not binding today µt = 0 but will bind in some state
tomorrow. Under discretion, a capital inflow tax will reduce current consumption by reducing borrowing;
since the constraint is not binding there is no direct current collateral effect and so there is no offsetting
increase in borrowing capacity that would allow higher current consumption. Moreover, the effect of a
current capital inflow tax on qt+1 through the indirect mechanism in equation (8) above has no direct
benefit in terms of relaxing next period’s constrained borrowing. What the planner would like to do is to
increase qt+2 but that is infeasible, since this depends on the next period’s planner’s actions. Hence, when
the current collateral constraint does not bind, there is no benefit to a capital inflow tax. This implies
that there is no scope for using capital taxes as ‘macro-prudential’ instruments - unlike much of the recent
literature, we find that capital taxes will not be used to reduce the risk of future crises.
Surprisingly, this result also extends to the case with policy commitment. Under commitment, the
current government can increase qt+2 , but it does so by using τc,t+1 ; there is no reason to ‘move early’ since
the current level of consumption does not need to be distorted and the future level of consumption only
needs to be adjusted if the constraint actually turns out to bind.30 We show this in Appendix E.

31

This result would change if collateral is valued at qt , for the reasons we discussed in the four-period
finite horizon model – the planner now can influence the constraint in the next period directly via changing
the level of debt, and so will engage in ex ante interventions even if µc,t = 0. That is a macro-prudential
tax is then used actively in cases where a crisis is likely in the future.
Figure 6 describes the policy functions implied by the following experiment. Imagine that all future
planners follow the time-consistent optimal monetary policy alone, without capital control policy. But
then we allow the current planner to choose an optimal capital flow tax in addition to optimal monetary
policy, which will be conditional on the net debt level and the exogenous state of the world. Note that
this is not an equilibrium policy setting, since we are assuming that the current planner has a policy menu
wider than do future planners. Nevertheless, the experiment illustrates the incentive to use capital inflow
taxes. Figure 6 shows that the planner will raise the capital inflow tax from zero, but will keep inflation
equal to the target in all states. The rise in the capital tax raises net foreign assets, increases expected
30
In Jeanne and Korinek (2013), collateral is valued at the worst asset price that obtains tomorrow; ex ante policy arises in
their model because the government lacks sufficient instruments to deal with the binding constraint tomorrow. Imposing their
constraint in our model would not change our results, but would substantially complicate the solution due to the possibility
of discontinuities in the decision rules.
31
Note however that we do not characterize the full quantitative solution to the problem under policy commitment.

34

next period capital price, relative to that in the Ramsey optimal monetary policy. The relaxation of the
collateral constraint implies that intermediate imports, labor and output fall by less in the crisis than under
the Ramsey optimal monetary policy. Nevertheless, Figure 6 also shows that the current capital price will
fall relative to that in the Ramsey optimal monetary policy case. The time t planner ignores this decline,
since the collateral constraint at time t is unaffected by the time t capital price.
But Figure 6 does not represent the equilibrium policy functions. In equilibrium, the planner in every
period will have access to the capital inflow tax. How do the results change in an equilibrium where the
capital tax is utilized in all periods? Figure 7 illustrates the results for the equilibrium policy game. Here
we see a striking difference from Figure 6. Both the price of capital and the expected capital price to real
exchange rate ratio (which governs the degree to which the collateral constraint binds) are systematically
lower than that of the optimal Ramsey monetary policy, even in states where the collateral constraint
does not bind. As a corollary to this, net debt is everywhere below that of the Ramsey optimal monetary
policy; the economy has systematically lower borrowing in the time-consistent equilibrium with capital
taxes. Since the capital price is lower in the economy with inflow taxes, the threshold debt level which
causes the collateral constraint to bind is lower in this equilibrium also.
How can the outcome with optimal capital inflow taxes differ so starkly from the economy with optimal
monetary policy alone? The key feature is that in this setting, time-consistent optimal taxes are deployed in
any state where the collateral constraint is binding, taking into account their ability to influence expected
future asset prices, but ignoring their impact on current asset prices. In an equilibrium, this lowers asset
prices uniformly, since financial markets are forward looking, and the possibility of future crisis events
which trigger a rise in capital inflow taxes will reduce the equilibrium price of assets at any given period.
With lower asset prices on average, at any given level of debt, the collateral constraint is more likely to be
binding, conditional on the state of the world. But this in turn leads households to increase precautionary
saving, and the average debt level for the economy falls.
In the out-of-equilibrium experiment discussed above, we noted that the capital inflow tax cushioned
the impact of a crisis on the real economy, leading to a higher level of output, labor and intermediate
imports conditional on a given level of debt, and state of the world. But in the equilibrium with time
consistent inflow taxes, this situation is no longer necessarily the case. Figure 7 shows that, since the crisis
is triggered at lower levels of debt, output, employment and imports may be lower than in the Ramsey
monetary policy equilibrium conditional on the level of debt and the state of the world. Likewise, the real

exchange rate is systematically higher, given a lower level of consumption and aggregate demand.
These results show that an equilibrium where optimal capital taxes are chosen without commitment
may have undesirable side effects. In subsection 6.4 below we translate these differences into welfare terms.
There we see that welfare may be lower in the Ramsey equilibrium with capital control policy, without
commitment, than in the competitive equilibrium without optimal policy. This result is quite different than
the existing literature, where capital controls, even if not fully optimal, are at least welfare-improving.32
Figure 8 illustrates the crisis event analysis in the equilibrium with capital controls, and compares this
to the outcome of the competitive equilibrium and the Ramsey optimal monetary policy. The definition of
a crisis is equivalent to that of Figure 4. With capital taxes, the policy maker completely eschews active
monetary policy, and maintains a strict inflation targeting at all times. Instead, as described above, when
the collateral constraint binds, the policymaker imposes a capital inflow tax. The tax leads to a fall in net
external debt, which allows for a relaxation of the collateral constraint (the Lagrange multiplier rises by
less than in the Ramsey equilibrium with optimal monetary policy). As a result the average crisis is less
severe with the capital inflow tax.33

A related result can be found in Young (2012), where it is optimal to ‘tie the hands’ of the current government by giving

33
Note that this statement is not inconsistent with the discussion above indicating that the impact of a binding constraint
may be more severe with capital inflow taxes than without, since in that case we were comparing outcomes with equal levels
of net external assets. In the average crisis event of Figure 8, net external assets are always higher in the economy with capital

Figure 9 shows the welfare gains for the “best” and “worst” states as previously described.34 The
Figure shows welfare relative to that in the competitive equilibrium with strict inflation targeting, and as
before, the evaluation is conditional on net external assets. The first point to note is that welfare for the
Ramsey optimal monetary policy, is almost identical to that of the competitive equilibrium. This is not
exactly true, since it is possible to show that the Ramsey equilibrium raises welfare very slightly relative
to the competitive equilibrium, particularly for very high levels of net external debt, where crises are more
likely. But the welfare gains for the optimal Ramsey monetary policy relative to strict inflation targeting
are extremely small.
By contrast, the Figure shows that welfare is unambiguously lower in the time-consistent Ramsey
equilibrium with both optimal monetary and capital control policy. Moreover, the welfare losses are
greater, the higher is the level of net external debts.
Welfare gains are similar in shape across states, but are a bit larger in bad times. Furthermore, the
relative welfare losses associated with capital controls are much larger in the bad state than in the good
one.

Moment analysis

Table 4 illustrates the moments for a series of variables in the model across the different regimes, including the frequency with which crises occur. A crisis scenario is defined as a binding collateral constraint.
The occurrence of crisis doesn’t change much across various monetary and capital control policy regimes.
Compared to the competitive equilibrium with strict inflation targeting but without any capital controls,
optimal monetary policy alone slightly reduces the volatility of fundamentals. With capital controls in
place, the economy has a lower debt and higher consumption in the stationary equilibrium since households increase their precautionary savings. A lower debt is associated with a less severe financial crisis,
which can be seen from the lower value of external finance premium. Note that capital price under capital

control is also lower than that without controls.

Policy under commitment: an example

The previous sections show that without commitment, capital inflow taxes will be imposed in a crisis,
and welfare will be lower relative to a regime of optimal monetary policy without capital controls. An
obvious question is what happens if there is some commitment device which binds policymakers to stick to a
particular policy prescription? A full characterization of optimal policies under commitment is beyond the
scope of this paper.35 Nevertheless, we know from the finite-period example in section 4 that a policymaker
would subsidize capital inflows in the second period when the credit constraint binds since this will have the
effect of relaxing first period credit constraints.36 Following a similar argument, we ask whether subsiding
capital inflows during a crisis could improve welfare in the full dynamic model. We conjecture a simple but
operational capital inflow subsidy, τc,t = −ςµt , for a small positive constant ς. This capital inflow subsidy
35
Solving for the optimal policy under commitment involves a large increase in the number of state variables required for
the solution for policy functions.
36
Farhi and Werning (2014) study optimal capital controls under commitment in a world economy of many small open
economies akin to Gali and Monacelli (2005) but with risk premium shocks. They find that dealing with a sudden stop requires
a temporary subsidy on inflows and a tax on outflows.

is tied to the severity of a crisis. A deeper crisis requires a larger subsidy to restore borrowing capacity
and therefore to maintain a higher consumption than that without subsidy. We assume that policymakers
honor this capital control policy in each period. Although it is in effect only in a crisis, the capital inflow
subsidy affects households’ borrowing and consumption both in crises and in normal times.
Figure 10 displays policy functions under commitment with ς = 0.2 when monetary policy maintains
inflation strictly equal to the targets, and the exogenous shocks lead to the worst possible state.37 Subsiding
capital inflows in a crisis increases effective consumption for every given level of debt. Higher effective
consumption leads to a higher current capital price and expected ratio of future capital price to future
real exchange rate, which in turn expands borrowing capacity and increases the cutoff debt level that
triggers the binding collateral constraint. Compared with the competitive equilibrium without capital
inflow tax/subsidy, imports, employment and output are higher when capital inflow subsidy is in place.
Therefore, a higher borrowing capacity and a higher effective consumption implies higher welfare for
domestic households (see figure 11).

Sticky Wages
A broad message of this paper is that in open economies with financial frictions but without policy

commitment monetary policy should not be combined with capital controls. But in Figure 5 above, we
noted that the effect of an optimal monetary policy, relative to strict inflation targeting, was minimal.
Although the optimal monetary policy calls for a sharp deviation from inflation targeting during a crisis,
the crisis response under strict inflation targeting and the optimal monetary policy was relatively small.
A similar message comes from the welfare evaluation. The reason for this is familiar from the literature
on New Keynesian models. Nominal rigidities in prices can be relatively easily overcome by strict inflation
targeting - we find that this message extends to the response to crises to a substantial extent.
But with more extensive nominal rigidities, the role for monetary policy can be much greater. Here,
we illustrate this briefly, by extending our model of nominal rigidities to include both price and wage
stickiness.38 The model details are delegated to the Appendix F.
37

We do not explore the optimal level of ς. For smaller or larger than ς = 0.2 capital inflow subsidies, we obtain the same
qualitative results.
38
A number of papers have documented the role of rigid wages, in particular downwardly rigid wages, for emerging economies
during financial crises (for instance, Card and Hyslop, 1997, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2015); it is also the case that the
importance of optimal monetary policy is enhanced if wages are sticky (the quantitative deviations from pure inflation targeting
were quite small in the previous section and the welfare consequences were negligible).

Figure 11: Welfare gains in the optimal monetary policy without capital controls (M), optimal monetary and
capital controls (M and C), and a competitive equilibrium with strict inflation targeting and an ad hoc statecontingent capital inflow subsidy τc,t = −0.2µt (CE with subsidy), relative to the competitive equilibrium with strict
inflation targeting (CE). Welfare gains are measured by the percentage changes of certainty equivalence of effective
consumption across policy regimes. The ‘best shock’ refers to policy functions when domestic households face low
foreign interest rate, high domestic productivity and high domestic leverage, while the ‘worst shock’ shows the case
with high foreign interest rate, low domestic productivity and low domestic leverage.

Figure 12 reports variables of interest in a typical event analysis and figure 13 shows the welfare gains
across policy regimes. With downward nominal wage rigidity, the competitive equilibrium with strict
inflation targeting suffers a large decline in employment and output. Under optimal monetary policy, the
monetary authority creates inflation and devalues the domestic currency to restore domestic employment
and output. The effect of monetary policy is substantial compared to the case without downward nominal
wage rigidity. Figure 12 shows that output losses can be reduced by one half under the optimal monetary
policy in crisis.39 When output is less depressed under optimal monetary policy, households repay a larger
amount of debt in order to smooth consumption. In terms of welfare, households are significantly and
uniformly better off than in the competitive equilibrium with strict inflation targeting (see panel (a)-(b)
in figure 13).
When both monetary policy and capital controls are in place, again without commitment, the policy
maker sets a positive capital inflow tax, 9.5%, in the peak period of a crisis and imposes zero capital
controls out of crisis. However, unlike the previous case, where active monetary policy was not combined
39

Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2015) and Na, Schmitt-Grohé, Uribe and Yue (2014) also show that depreciating domestic
currency can significantly reduce unemployment and output losses in crisis when nominal wages are downwardly rigid.

capital controls (M) and optimal monetary and capital controls (M and C), relative to the competitive equilibrium
with strict inflation targeting (CE). Welfare gains are measured by the percentage change of effective consumption
equivalence across policy regimes. The vertical axis is the past real wage wt−1 and the horizontal axis stands for
debt level b∗t . Panel (a)-(b) are for M policy relative to the CE with strict price inflation targeting under the worst
and best state respectively, and (c)-(d) for M and C policy relative to M policy under the worst and best state
respectively. The ‘best shock’ refers to policy functions when domestic households face low foreign interest rate, high

with capital controls in a crisis, the optimal monetary now combines both capital controls and monetary
policy to react to a crisis. Monetary policy generates inflation and currency devaluation to dampen the
adverse shocks to the economy (see figure 12). Again, due to the time consistency problem, higher capital
controls lead to a lower welfare for households (see panel (c)-(d) in figure 13).

Conclusion
This paper has studied the optimal conduct of monetary policy and capital controls during a ”Sudden

Stop” engineered by a binding collateral constraint. We highlight several main results here in the conclusion. First, inflation targeting is optimal outside Sudden Stops, but during a financial crisis it is optimal
to generate some domestic inflation; this result comes from the absence of a tool designed specifically
to deal with the underlying causes of the crisis (the financial accelerator). Second, capital controls are
suboptimal but will be used in a time-consistent equilibrium, and therefore should not be placed under
the control of the monetary authority. Third, the case for ex ante intervention is heavily dependent on
arbitrary choices regarding the valuation of collateral and therefore could be related to the optimal choice
of financial regulation.
There are many extensions that we plan to consider going forward. In particular, we plan to use the
model to study the optimal use of monetary and capital control policy in the presence of a fixed exchange
rate – the ‘dilemma-not-trilemma’ argument currently playing out in the literature states that monetary
policy is severely weakened by the absence of capital controls even if exchange rates are fixed. Exactly
what this statement means is unclear – does it mean that interventions must be larger to achieve the same
goals, or does it mean that the optimal adjustment is smaller, or perhaps something else entirely? Since a
fixed exchange rate may inhibit some of the adverse movements in the value of collateral, our model may
imply that pegs are occasionally useful.

Equilibrium conditions in the simplified model

This appendix describes the equilibrium conditions under various policy regimes in the four-period simplified
model. We first discuss the competitive equilibrium, then the first best allocation. Allocations under full commitment
and under discretion are in the last two subsections.

54

B.1

The competitive equilibrium

In the competitive equilibrium, firm-households at each period choose consumption, borrowing, capital stock,
labor and imports, given capital price and capital control policies. Observe that there’s no financial friction in the
last period. Labor supply, imports and output are exogenously-determined in period t = 3

given the initial state b∗0 and government policy τc,t . Other variables can be solved based on the remaining equations.

B.2

The first best allocation

The only friction in this simplified model is the collateral constraint and the only uncertainty comes from leverage
shocks. Both of these originate from the financial sector. If there were no financial frictions, leverage shocks would
not affect aggregate variables and financial variables at all. As a benchmark, we first consider an economy without
financial frictions, where collateral constraints are always slack in every period. Note that without credit constraints,
labor, imports and production are completely exogenous and the economy collapses to an endowment economy. In
the current case with only leverage shocks, firm-households’ labor income and profits in all periods are constant as
in period t = 3. The optimality conditions read

B.3

Equilibrium under commitment

We now turn to the optimal capital control policies. Under commitment, policy makers in each period can
commit themselves to a policy path τc,t with t = 0, 1, specified at the initial period t = 0. They choose such a policy
path to maximize the lifetime utility of a representative household subject to the implementability constraints. The
social planner under commitment is defined as follows.

Equilibrium under discretion

Under discretion, the planner at each period will reset the level of capital control to maximize the lifetime utility
of a representative agent conditional on the information up to that period, here the level of borrowing and exogenous
shocks. The planner will ignore the impact of current policy on the past households’ decisions, while policy makers
take such impact into account under commitment.

YF,t (b∗1 ; κ1 ), µt (b∗1 ; κ1 ), b∗t+1 (b∗1 ; κ1 ), Lt (b∗1 ; κ1 ), ct (b∗1 ; κ1 ), rK,t (b∗1 ; κ1 ), c̃t (b∗1 ; κ1 ) for t = 1, 2, and V1 (b∗1 ; κ1 ).

Once the policymaker at period t = 0 solves problem (B.10), the allocations across all periods can be pinned
down completely.

B.5

Specification of shocks

The only exogenous disturbance is the leverage shock κt . For simplicity, we assume that uncertainty is resolved
in the very beginning of period t = 0. The leverage parameter is fixed at κt = 0.4 for t = 0, 1, 2. Parameter q̄ is
chosen such that the credit constraint at period t = 2 is binding when it also binds at period t = 1, say q̄ = q2F B /1.35,
where superscript F B denotes the first-best. This specification makes the ‘financial accelerator’ work in the first two
periods t = 0, 1.

C

Derivation of import tax

In the baseline infinite-period model, domestic policy maker has an incentive to manipulate terms of trade
and pecuniary externality simultaneously. In order to focus on the role of capital controls for fixing pecuniary
externalities, we put an exogenous import tax to correct the terms of trade manipulation in normal times. To
simplify the derivation, we assume that the policymaker faces a collateral whose value is exogenously determined.

There is a constant export markup ρ/(ρ − 1) in the social planner’s optimality conditions. To be consistent with
this allocation and also following the literature, we impose a constant import tax τN,t ≡ 1/(ρ − 1) in the competitive
equilibrium. With this constant tax, capital controls do not target the terms of trade manipulation in normal times.

D

Optimal capital controls under commitment

This section derives the optimality conditions faced by a Ramsey planner under commitment. For simplicity, we
consider a perfect foresight model, but the arguments in the perfect foresight model go through unchanged for the
stochastic infinite horizon model.
Assume that the exogenous shocks are realized at the very beginning of the initial period t = 0. The planner
chooses a sequence of state-contingent capital inflow tax {τc,t }+∞
t=0 at period t = 0 to maximize a representative
household’s lifetime utility and commits to honor this policy profile at every following period. Equivalently, the

59

planner chooses a sequence of allocations and prices subjective to the implementability constraints. The inflow
tax τc,t is then backed out from the household’s bond Euler equation. We consider first a model without nominal
rigidities.

Under commitment, the Ramsey planner takes into account of the effects of future allocations and prices on the
past allocations and prices, which works through Lagrange multipliers λ2,t−1 and λ9,t−1 . The logic in this model is
the same as that in the simplified finite-period model.
Now consider a model with nominal rigidities. Policy instruments are monetary policy and capital controls. Note
that nominal rigidities are introduced through price adjustment costs deviating from a constant inflation target. Any
deviation from the target in normal times (non-crisis episodes) will reduce total output available to private agents
and distort factor prices in the economy. If monetary policy were in place, the monetary authority would completely
neutralize nominal rigidities through strict price stability period by period. This optimal monetary policy holds both
under discretion and under commitment in normal times. With both monetary policy and capital control instruments
at hand, monetary policy can completely stabilize domestic prices to offset nominal rigidities both in normal times
and in crisis, and the optimal capital controls are laid down as above.

61

D.1

Optimal capital controls under discretion

Under discretion, a Ramsey planner has a chance to re-optimize her problem at every period and does not take
into account of the effects of current policy on the responses of past endogenous variables. Therefore, the only
endogenous state variable inherited from the previous planner is borrowing b∗t+1 . The optimality conditions under
discretion are the same conditions as those in period t = 0 (equation D.9-D.17), λ2,t−1 = λ9,t−1 = 0, implying
λ2,t = λ8,t = 0, and λ12,t = Uc (t).
First notice that when the collateral constraint binds at period t µt > 0, equation (D.14) implies that λ6,t = 0.
From equation (D.16), λ13,t = λ12,t et ρ/(ρ − 1). Combining equation (D.11) and (D.10) yields λ7,t = 0 and λ10,t =
λ12,t . The bond Euler equation (D.17) can then be written as

When the elasticity ρ is large and the value of collateralized assets qt+1 /et+1 is steep with respect to borrowing b∗t+1 ,
the Ramsey planner under discretion always taxes capital inflow τc,t > 0 whenever the collateral constraint binds.
Similarly, when the collateral constraint does not bind at period t, one can show that λ6,t = 0, λ7,t = 0, λ9,t = 0,
λ10,t = λ12,t and λ13,t = λ12,t et ρ/(ρ − 1).

Proof of Proposition 2

We state the proof explicitly for a deterministic finite horizon case based on the optimality conditions derived
from Appendix D, but the results go through unchanged for the stochastic infinite horizon model.
Consider first the Ramsey planner decisions in periods t = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} in a perfect foresight model where
constraints do not bind in t = {0, 1} and bind with certainty in t = {2, 3}. Note that the Lagrange multipliers
for the capital Euler equation λ2,t and the collateral constraint λ9,t carry the constraints under commitment into
period t + 1. In the optimality conditions under commitment, only (λ2,t−1 , λ9,t−1 ) and (λ2,t , λ9,t ) appear, and not
the multipliers (λ2,t+1 , λ9,t+1 ). Therefore, capital controls are not ‘macro-prudential’ in our model economy.
When µ0 = 0 in period t = 0, we have λ2,0 = λ9,0 = 0 whenever λ2,−1 = λ9,−1 = 0. In period t = 1, we still have
λ2,1 = λ9,1 = 0 if µ1 = 0 both under commitment and under discretion, although constraints will bind at t = 2 with

62

certainty. We then have τc,0 = τc,1 = 0.
Second, consider a more general case. In the case without commitment, λ2,t = λ9,t = 0 as long as µt = 0
for any period t as shown in Appendix D.1, even though the collateral constraint binds next period, and thereby
τc,t = 0. In the case with commitment, when the collateral constraints don’t bind for many periods to the extent
that λ2,t−1 = λ9,t−1 = 0, the argument starting from period t = 0 above still goes through and τc,t = 0 if µt = 0.
Note that the crisis is rare and isn’t persistent, the statement that τc,t = 0 when µt = 0 holds most of time under
commitment.
The argument goes through unchanged if the constraint binds only with some probability in the next period.

A model with sticky prices and sticky wages

We detail here only the model equations that change, rather than present the entire model again. We interpret
households now as being endowed with a specific type of labor, lt (j), for which they are the monopoly supplier to
the market. These labor services are aggregated into a labor composite

and the demand for labor of type j is

For simplicity, we permit trade in a full set of contingent securities to eliminate differences across types.
Labor income for a household with type j labor now has a new term. In the budget constraint labor income is
reduced by a fraction ψt (j), which will reflect resources lost in the adjustment of individual nominal wages. Following
Varian (1975) and Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009), we permit asymmetric adjustment:

ϕ captures indexation of nominal wages to inflation, φW captures the convexity of adjustment costs, and γW controls
the asymmetry (specifically, γW < 0 implies it is costlier to reduce than increase nominal wages).
We consider only symmetric equilibrium where nominal wages do not depend on j, leading to the wage Phillips

There are three more parameters to be calibrated, φW , θW and γW , in the this extension. We set φW = 32,
θW = 3.5 as in Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2009), and focus on a small downward wage asymmetry γW = −20 for the
illustrative purpose. The wage indexation parameter is set as ϕ = 0 to study the nominal wage rigidity.

The solution algorithm for the competitive equilibrium

We solve for policy functions in the competitive equilibrium based on the first-order necessary conditions in
Appendix A. First, the following transformation is used to take care of the occasionally binding constraints:

Second, the endogenous state variable b∗t is discretized into 300 grid points. Combining with 8 grid points for

the three exogenous shocks Zt ≡ (At , Rt+1

iteration to find a fixed point of the model.
Note that the following five variables, representing inputs, total output, the return on capital, and consumption

grid point (b∗t , Zt ) from the system of equilibrium conditions by using a Newton-type nonlinear solver. Whenever
the nonlinear solver fails to find a solution, we then apply a homotopy path-following algorithm to find a good initial
guess for the nonlinear solver (Eaves and Schmedders, 1999). When policy functions in two consecutive periods are
close enough, say, the maximal difference is below  = 10−5 , the iteration stops; otherwise redo the iteration starting
from new policy functions obtained at period t.

The solution algorithm for the Ramsey problems

We solve the Ramsey planner’s problem based on value function V (b∗t , Zt ) directly, subject to the implementability
constraints, which are defined in the main text. Similarly to the competitive equilibrium, the occasionally binding
constraint and its Lagrange multiplier are replaced by two smooth functions (G.1-G.2). We use time iteration to
find a fixed point of the model.

pM,t+1 (b∗t+1 , Zt+1 ), πt+1 (b∗t+1 , Zt+1 ), and value function Vt+1 (b∗t+1 , Zt+1 ), we can find b∗t+1 , Lt , C̃t , Yt , YF,t , qt , ηt ,
rK,t , et , pM,t and πt to maximize the current value function Vt (b∗t , Zt ), subject to the implementability constraints,
at each grid point (b∗t , Zt ), by using a feasible sequential quadratic programming (Schittkowski, 2014). When policy
functions and value function in two consecutive periods are close enough, say, the maximal difference is below
 = 10−5 , the iteration stops; otherwise redo the iteration starting from new policy functions obtained at period t.
