Estimating Life-Cycle Parameters from Consumption Behavior at Retirement

NBER Working Paper No. 11163

JEL No. E21, D11, D12
ABSTRACT
Using pseudo-panel data, we estimate the structural parameters of a life--cycle consumption model
with discrete labor supply choice. A focus of our analysis is the abrupt drop in consumption upon
retirement for a typical household. The literature sometimes refers to the drop, which in the U.S.
Consumer Expenditure Survey we estimate to be approximately 16%, as the “retirement-consumption puzzle.” Although a downward step in consumption at retirement contradicts
predictions from life--cycle models with additively separable consumption and leisure, or with
continuous work-hour options, a consumption jump is consistent with a setup having nonseparable
preferences over consumption and leisure and requiring discrete work choices. This paper specifies
a life--cycle model with these latter two elements, and it uses the empirical magnitude of the drop
in consumption at retirement to provide an advantageous method of identifying structural parameters
--- most importantly, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

Estimating Life—Cycle Parameters from
Consumption Behavior at Retirement

1. Introduction
The life—cycle saving model is a cornerstone of modern economic policy analysis. Researchers use the framework to study, among other topics, economic growth, business
cycles, social insurance, and trade and tax policies (e.g., Diamond [1965], Auerbach and
Kotlikoﬀ [1987], Lucas [1990, 2003], Hubbard et al. [1995], Altig et al. [2001], and many
others). In a number of applications, both the model’s ability to match data and the answer
it gives to economic questions depend critically on values of its parameters, especially the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption. For example, see Woodford [2003,
ch.4] on macroeconomic implications, Weil [1989] on the risk free rate puzzle, Lucas [2003]
on the welfare costs of business cycles, and Jones et al. [2003] on the relationship between
volatility and growth. The importance of the model’s parameters naturally generates interest in credible and precise estimates of their magnitudes (e.g., Hall [1988], Campbell
and Mankiw [1989], and Attanasio and Weber [1993]). Controversy about parameter values nevertheless persists, in part due to data limitations. We believe, however, that the
recent literature documenting the drop in average household consumption expenditure at
retirement – the “retirement—consumption puzzle” – suggests a new avenue for progress.
With the goal of enhancing the life—cycle model’s usefulness for current and future policy
research, this paper reconciles the model with empirical evidence on the change in households’ expenditure at retirement and then uses the magnitude of that change as a novel
and, we argue, advantageous source of identification in estimating parameters.
A number of recent papers describe a substantial drop in household expenditures at
retirement.1 Some authors view the sudden change in expenditures as a puzzle. Indeed,

a central prediction of the life—cycle model is that agents should smooth marginal utility
across ages, and, in the simplest formulations of model, this prediction maps into an
optimal life—cycle path of consumption that is itself smooth. When, for example, retirement
is anticipated, and when utility is an additively separable function of consumption and
leisure, consumption should change continuously with age.
However, preferences over consumption and leisure may not take an additively separable form.2 Furthermore, a number of economists argue that opportunities for market—work
hours are not continuous. We show formally below that a tractable life—cycle specification with intratemporal utility that is nonseparable in consumption and leisure, with work
options that are discrete, and with a retirement age that emerges from household choice,
predicts a discontinuous consumption change at retirement.
We then show that if one is willing to treat the change in household consumption at
retirement as a consequence of purposeful behavior, the magnitude of the change provides
useful information for estimating life—cycle model parameters. Consider the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution (IES). Suppose that consumption and leisure are complements
(i.e., that we have intratemporal nonseparability) and that a household anticipates a discrete increase in leisure upon retiring. In that case, the household will want to change its
consumption abruptly at retirement; moreover, the direction and magnitude of the desired
change will depend on the household’s taste for smoothing utility over time, that is, on its
IES for consumption/leisure services. In particular, if a household’s taste for intertemporal
smoothing is high, it may choose to decrease its consumption at retirement so that lost
utility from consumption oﬀsets gains from additional leisure. If, on the other hand, it has
and Stephens [2004], and Aguiar and Hurst [2004]. The decline estimated in these papers
ranges from 7% to 35%.

Indeed Attanasio and Weber [1993] and Meghir and Weber [1996] argue that allowing
for nonseparability is crucial for fitting the data.

a lower desire for intertemporal smoothing, a household might increase its consumption
at retirement – to take advantage of the complementarity of consumption and leisure.
The size, and sign, of the consumption change registered in the data can thus help us to
estimate households’ IES.
By oﬀering an alternative method for identifying life—cycle parameters, especially the
IES, this paper contributes to a literature that has formed two basic strands. The first
calibrates the life-cycle model from (macro) data and various existing studies (e.g., Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987], Cooley and Prescott [1995], and Altig et al. [2001]). This strand
tends to favor a moderate IES for consumption, usually between 0.2 and 1.0. The second
strand of the literature typically identifies the IES for consumption with the coeﬃcient
on the, properly instrumented, rate of return on assets in a consumption Euler equation.
This strand includes analyses of macro data, which sometimes estimate an IES very near
zero (e.g., Hall [1988], Campbell and Mankiw [1989]), and analyses of micro data, which
typically estimate an IES between 0.5 and 0.8 (e.g., Attanasio and Weber [1993] and Banks
et al. [1998]). Our approach can contribute evidence on the robustness of IES estimates
to variation in method of estimation and decision domain.3
Furthermore, our method has the advantage that it estimates the IES from changes
3

Other papers have provided alternative methods for estimating and IES parameter.

For example, Barsky et al. [1997] use the responses to hypothetical questions to estimate the
IES. Estimating fully specified structural models, Rust and Phelan [1997] identify an IES
from the labor supply and Social Security application decisions of older males; and Keane
and Wolpin [2001] identify an IES for services from the decisions of young men concerning
schooling, work and saving. Using aggregate data, Basu and Kimball [2003] implement a
model with nonseparable consumption and leisure and with income and substitution eﬀects
on labor supply that cancel. Their method indicates an IES of 0.5 since the 1980s, but it
is unstable for earlier data from the postwar period.

associated with a highly predictable and consequential life event, namely, retirement. The
standard strategy of instrumenting for asset returns in period t+1 using economic variables
known in period t suﬀers from two limitations. First, the relevant variation (anticipated
changes in real rates of return) is modest in size, in practice perfectly correlated across
individuals in a cross section and, therefore, seems unlikely to produce changes in behavior
that are large enough to be precisely estimated from available data. Second, changes in
asset returns are notoriously diﬃcult to predict. As a result, problems of weak instruments arise.4 This paper’s identification strategy, in contrast, depends on a phenomenon
that is economically substantial, mostly anticipated, and independently repeated within
cross sections of data. In addition, our method has the advantage that it does not rely on
unmodeled sources of variation. Interpreting rate—of—return estimates may require a specification with household decision making under uncertainty, household prediction of the
distribution for future shocks, and even transactions costs – all elements beyond the scope
of many policy—simulation models. Our procedure, on the other hand, straightforwardly
employs a model designed for policy experiments.
Our approach relies on interpreting the change in expenditure at retirement as intentional. Haider and Stephens [2004] test an alternative idea that consumption declines
on average at retirement because retirement is often unexpected. Using subjective predictions about retirement age as an instrument for anticipated retirement, they find that the
expenditure decline remains statistically and economically significant (though one—third
smaller than with non—IV estimates). In a related study, Hurd and Rohwedder [2003] use
novel survey questions about expectations and show that households anticipate that their
consumption will dip about 20% at retirement. Similarly, Laitner [2001] points out that
4

See Yogo [2004] for a thorough discussion. An advantage, nevertheless, of using an-

ticipated changes in asset returns to estimate the IES is that the validity of the estimate
does not depend on a particular functional form for the utility function.

financial advisors have long said that retirees should plan for less consumption than working people: he quotes a TIAA—CREF brochure stating that “you’ll need 60 to 90 percent
of current income in retirement, adjusted for inflation, to maintain the lifestyle you now
lead,” and he cites a popular press article writing that “many financial planners say it will
take 70 to 80 percent of your current income to maintain your standard of living when
you retire.” These sources suggest that households anticipate a drop in consumption at
retirement and, therefore, that this change is intentional.
We employ two data sets. We use pseudo—panel data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey 1984-2001 to estimate a consumption-Euler equation. The estimated
coeﬃcients are composites of underlying parameters from a life—cycle model with nonseparable consumption and leisure. As in previous studies, we find a substantial average drop in
household expenditure at retirement. Combining the consumption coeﬃcients, a life—cycle
model, and lifetime earnings profiles from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) panel
data, we use an equation measuring the model’s predicted optimal retirement age against
HRS data on retirement to extract estimates of structural parameters. We estimate, quite
precisely, intertemporal elasticity parameter values that are on the higher end of those
found and used in the literature: our IES for services is approximately 0.67, and we estimate an IES for consumption of 0.87. We then assess the model’s “out-of-sample” fit
by comparing its prediction of average household wealth at retirement with HRS data on
middle class net worth (data which did not inform the estimation). Despite the inclusion
of a drop in consumption at retirement, our model matches the wealth data remarkably
well.
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses several of our key
assumptions. Section 3 presents our model and estimation strategy. Sections 4—5 discuss
our data and present our estimates. Section 6 compares simulations from our model with
HRS data on household net worth. Section 7 concludes.

2. Assumptions
In this paper’s model, every household chooses its saving and labor supply to maximize
its utility subject to a lifetime budget constraint. Our analysis assumes that (1) the
work day is indivisible, (2) private—pension formulas do not aﬀect workers’ retirement
age, (3) household preference orderings may be intratemporally nonseparable with respect
consumption and leisure, and (4) perfect markets exist for annuities, health and disability
insurance. Our rationale for assumptions (1)—(3) is as follows.
Assumption 1: The work day is indivisible.
Households in our analysis must either work full time or retire. While in practice
employers do oﬀer part—time jobs, the rate of pay is, on average, substantially lower than
that for full—time work.5 As Rust and Phelan [1997, p.786] write,
The finding that most workers make discontinuous transitions from full—
time work to not working, and the finding that the majority of the relatively
small number of ‘gradual retirees’ reduce their annual hours of work by taking on
a sequence of lower wage partial retirement ‘bridge jobs’ rather than gradually
reducing hours of work at their full-time pre-retirement ‘career job’ suggests the
existence of explicit or implicit constraints on the individual’s choice of hours of
work.
An indivisibility assumption is also consistent with the fact that U.S. data show little trend
in male work hours or participation rates after 1940, except for a trend toward earlier
retirement 1940-80 (e.g., Pencavel [1986], Blundell and MaCurdy [1999], and Burkhauser
5

Reasons for the wage penalty for part-time work include daily fixed costs of startup

and shutdown, scheduling and coordination problems, employer concern for timely return on training investments, and the fixed—cost nature of some employee benefits (e.g.,
Hurd [1996]).
8

et al. [1999]).
Assumption 2: Pension formulas do not aﬀect retirement ages.
Although some analyses stress the importance of workers’ private pension plans as
determinants of retirement behavior (e.g., Gustman and Steinmeier [1986], Stock and
Wise [1990]), we assume that a worker chooses an employer whose pension plan matches
his requirements; thus, in this paper, private pensions form a part of private wealth accumulation and do not require separate attention. Arguments in favor of explicitly modeling
the distinct features of private pensions seem most applicable to defined benefit plans;
however, in practice defined contribution plans have become more important. Even in the
past, many of the features of defined benefit plans originated at union initiative or during
collective bargaining, and thus presumably reflected worker preferences.
Assumption 3: Utility is intratemporally nonseparable in consumption and leisure.
Although, for the sake of simplicity, this paper’s analysis assumes household preference
orderings are intertemporally separable, it makes consumption and leisure intratemporally
nonseparable. Since intratemporal nonseparability is central to this paper’s focus, we
examine its implications in detail.
To see the restrictions imposed by intratemporal separability, consider a specific example. A single—person household lives from t = 0 to t = T , choosing to retire at t = R.
The household’s time endowment at each age is 1; when the household works, its leisure
falls to ¯ ∈ (0, 1). According to assumption (1), indivisibilities force ¯ to be a fixed parameter. The wage is w; the interest rate is r. A household’s consumption ct yields utility
flow u(ct ); its leisure

t

yields utility flow v( t ); and, its assets (net worth) are at . The

household’s behavior solves

ȧt = r · at + (1 − t ) · w − ct ,

a0 = 0 = aT .
As utility depends on the sum u(c) + v( ), this is the separable case.
Provided u(.) is concave, specification (1) predicts that, even with a discrete increase
in leisure at retirement, there should be no abrupt change in consumption at that time.
To see this note that, along an optimal consumption path, the additional utility at date
s from one extra dollar’s consumption, u (cs ), must equal the additional utility from the
dollar if it were saved until later date t, by which time it will have grown to an amount
er·(t−s) . That is,

u (cs ) = er·(t−s) · u (ct ) ,

(2)

the so—called “Euler equation” for consumption. Letting ct− be consumption the instant
before t, and ct+ the instant after, condition (2) yields

u (ct− ) = u (ct+ ) .

(3)

With u (.) continuous, equation (3) is inconsistent with a jump in consumption at any age,
including at the age of retirement.
While intratemporal additivity is the most common specification for utility in the
life—cycle literature, a number of authors instead assume nonseparable preferences. A
10

well—known example is Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987].6 We can easily modify example (1)
to accommodate their alternative. Let a household have a constant returns to scale “neoclassical” production function f : R2 → R1 that combines current consumption and leisure
to generate a flow of services, the latter yielding a flow of utility, say, u(f ). The first line
of (1) changes to

max
R,ct

T

D
i
u f (ct , t ) dt ,

(4)

though constraints can remain the same. Because a bivariate constant—returns—to—scale
neoclassical production function has f12 (.) > 0, inputs are complementary in the sense
that more leisure (consumption) raises the marginal product of consumption (leisure).
If u(.) were linear, this complementarity would make the household want to increase its
consumption at (and after) retirement to take advantage of the increased marginal utility
of consumption that derives from higher leisure. If, on the other hand, u(.) is suﬃciently
concave, the household would strongly desire a smooth flow of services at diﬀerent ages;
hence, it would plan more consumption prior to t = R to counterbalance its abundant
service flow from leisure later. In the end, with nonseparability, rational behavior may
lead to an age profile of consumption which discontinuously changes in either direction at
retirement.
A specific parameterization with nonseparable consumption and leisure makes clear
the connection between the change in consumption at retirement and the structural parameters of the life—cycle model, and it will form the framework for our empirical analysis
later. Let the intratemporal household production function f (.) be Cobb—Douglas:

f (c, ) = [c]α · [ ]1−α ,
6

α ∈ (0, 1) .

See also King et al. [1988], Hurd and Rohwedder [2003], Cooley and Prescott [1995].
11

Let u(.) take the familiar isoelastic form

u(f ) =

[f ]γ
,
γ

γ < 1.

Recalling that changes from ¯ ∈ [0, 1) to 1 at retirement, condition (3) at retirement date
t = R is

([cR− ]α · [ ¯]1−α )γ−1 · α · [cR− ]α−1 · [ ¯]1−α = ([cR+ ]α )γ−1 · α · [cR+ ]α−1 ⇐⇒
[cR− ]α·γ−1 · [ ¯](1−α)·γ = [cR+ ]α·γ−1 ⇐⇒
[cR− ] · [ ¯]−

γ·(1−α)
1−α·γ

= [cR+ ] .

(5)

Equation (5) shows that the change in consumption at retirement provides useful
information for estimating the parameter γ, which determines the IES. Specifically, given
α and ¯, the change in consumption at retirement pins down γ. It is straightforward to
show that the change in consumption at retirement is strictly increasing in γ. In particular,
if γ is nearly 1, u(.) is nearly linear; and we have noted that in this case consumption jumps
up at retirement. More generally, whenever 0 < γ, consumption discontinuously rises at
retirement:

cR− < cR+

if [ ¯]−

γ·(1−α)
1−α·γ

> 1 ⇐⇒ −

γ · (1 − α)
< 0 ⇐⇒ γ > 0 .
1−α·γ

On the other hand, the preceding algebra indicates that

cR− > cR+ ⇐⇒ γ < 0 .
Thus, whenever γ < 0, the model predicts a discontinuous drop in consumption at retirement and, because (cR+ − cR− ) is increasing in γ, the decline in consumption at retirement
grows larger as the taste for intertemporal smoothing increases (γ decreases).
12

To summarize, our analysis illustrates that an abrupt adjustment in consumption
at retirement is consistent with rational behavior. Equation (5) also shows that data
on the size of change in consumption can help us to identify the taste for intertemporal
substitution. We now turn to this task of estimation.
3. Model
This section presents the model that is the basis for our empirical analysis. We first
elaborate the framework above to facilitate comparisons with data as follows: we allow for
changes in household size and composition that may influence households’ preferences for
consumption; and, we consider the possible role of liquidity constraints. Then we lay out
our estimation strategy.
Equivalent Adults. To confront data, we take into account the fact that households gain
and lose members over their life spans, and presumably desire greater consumption at ages
when their membership is larger.
Following Tobin [1967], let the number of “equivalent adults” per household of age t
be nt . Let nt satisfy

nt = 1 + ξ S · nSt + ξ C · nC
t ,

(6)

where the household’s head constitutes one equivalent adult, nSt is 1 if there is a spouse
S
C
and 0 otherwise, nC
t is the number of children in the household, and ξ and ξ are equiv-

alency weights (relative to the head’s weight of 1). If a household’s age—t expenditure on
consumption is ct , let the household’s corresponding flow of utility be
D ct
i
nt · u f ( , t ) .
nt

(7)

The idea is that households internally allocate their lifetime resources “fairly.” To understand the outcome, consider a household facing interest and subjective discount rates
13

of zero and suppose that

s

=

t.

Then in our framework, the household would want to

allocate budget x between periods s and t to solve

is concave, a solution requires cs /ns = ct /nt ; so, utility maximization

ct =

nt
· cs .
ns

In other words, if the household consists of the head alone at s, five members at t, and the
latter constitute two equivalent adults, the household will allocate twice as much budget
for consumption at t as at s. If there are scale economies to household operation or public
goods that household members can share, the weights on spouse and children will be less
than 1. The smaller are ξ S and ξ C , the larger the advantages of scale. We will estimate
ξ S and ξ C .
Liquidity Constraints.

A large literature studies the potential eﬀects of liquidity con-

straints on life—cycle saving (e.g., Mariger [1986], Zeldes [1989], Hubbard and Judd [1986]).
To analyze actual behavior, we separately consider two cases. In the first, financial markets
are unwilling to extend loans without collateral; thus, if at is household net worth at age
t, we incorporate into our model a constraint

at ≥ 0 all t .

(8)

In the second case, we allow at take any value (provided only that a0 = aT = 0). For
example, it is conceivable that unsecured credit—card debt has, at least in the last several
14

decades, enabled U.S. households to carry negative net worth balances. Or, inter vivos
transfers from parents to their grown children might largely eliminate the eﬀects of liquidity
constraints.
Model. The life—cycle maximization model upon which we base our empirical analysis is
as follows: for household i,

ai0 = 0 = aiT ,
where ρ is the subjective discount rate, and equivalent adults, nit , come from (6). Household i supplies eit “eﬀective hours” in the labor market per hour of work time; hence, if w
is the economy wide average wage rate, the household earns eis ·w per hour of market work
at age s. Earnings include both the wages of the head and those of the spouse, if present
and working in the labor market. We assume a proportional income tax τ on earnings,
interest, and one half of Social Security benefits, ssbit . The real interest rate r is given
in net—of—tax terms. There is also a proportional Social Security tax τ ss . As above, we
take f (.) to be Cobb—Douglas and u(.) to be isoelastic. In our first case, we incorporate
15

liquidity constraint (8), as shown. In a second case, we analyze (9) omitting the constraint
ait ≥ 0 all t.
The isoelastic utility function u(.) is standard. Our Cobb—Douglas specification for
f (.) has a number of advantages over a more general CES function that is sometimes used
in the literature: it does not imply secular trends in the average retirement age due to
technological progress; it is consistent with our aggregative approach in the sense that it
does not lead households of diﬀerent earning ability (i.e., diﬀerent eit in (9) at the same age
t) to behave diﬀerently; and, it allows exact identification below without disaggregative
data, time series variation in tax rates, etc.
Identification. This paper estimates two equations based on model (9). The first is the
Euler equation from utility maximization with respect to consumption; the second stems
from utility maximization with respect to retirement age. The parameters of ultimate
interest form a vector

θ ≡ (α, γ, ρ, ξ S , ξ C ) .
With both estimating equations together, the elements of θ are exactly identified.
Euler equation. Suppose for a given retirement age Ri that we solve (9) for the utility—
maximizing life—cycle time path of consumption. We then face a concave maximization
problem with a convex constraint set. Liquidity constraint (8) introduces complications,
but Mariger [1986] provides an algorithm. The algorithm divides a lifetime [0, T ] into a
sequence of closed intervals Ii . On alternate intervals either the liquidity constraint binds,
in which case ct equals the household’s current resource inflow, or the constraint does not
bind, in which case the Euler equation, described next, holds. In practice, in every case
that we consider, the algorithm finds at most two intervals. In the last, the Euler equation
holds; if there are two, the liquidity constraint binds in the first. For simplicity, henceforth

Thus, ψiS reflects a household’s entire life course – including its earning ability, number
of children, and retirement age.
Our empirical specification takes logarithms of both sides of (10) and appends a term
νis to the right side to reflect consumption measurement errors. From (6),

ln(nis ) ≈ ξ S · nSis + ξ C · nC

Writing (10) at s ≥ S and again at s + 1, taking logs, and diﬀerencing, we have

0, if s < R,
1, if s ≥ R.

Diﬀerencing eliminates ψiS from (11). Removing the influence of, among other things,
varying earning abilities, is extremely convenient in practice – our Health and Retirement Study data provide lifetime earning records for only one cohort of households, and,
although we have Consumer Expenditure Survey consumption data for many cohorts, the
latter data’s overlap with the cohort having complete earning information is short. Section 4 estimates (11) as a linear regression equation.
Optimal retirement age. The four coeﬃcients of diﬀerence equation (11) are composites
of the five structural parameters of the underlying model: letting the vector β denote the
coeﬃcients of (11), we have
18

β ≡ (β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 ) ≡ (

r−ρ
γ · (1 − α) · ln( ¯)
, ξS , ξC , −
).
1−α·γ
1−α·γ

(12)

Even if we have estimated β, we need one more condition to identify α, γ, and ρ separately.
To complete our identification, we turn to a second equation stemming from maximization
of (9) with respect to retirement age Ri .
For any parameter vector θ, one can solve model (9) for a household’s optimal retirement age. After maximizing (9) with respect to consumption – our Euler—equation step
above – call the criterion V (Ri ). Our next step chooses the R which maximizes V (R).
Although V (.) may not be concave, our numerical calculation maximizes V (R) by trying
every monthly retirement age from 0 to T .7 Denote the optimal retirement age as g(θ).
Given our functional forms, even if households have diﬀerent wage rates, reflecting diﬀerent
inherent earning abilities, their desired retirement ages are the same. Preferred retirement
ages could, nevertheless, diﬀer in practice because households anticipate diﬀerences in
longevity due to heredity; households have diﬀering numbers of children; occupations differ in their physical and emotional stress, leading to occupational diﬀerences in eit at
advanced ages; households have diﬀerent health status; households have diﬀering tastes
for leisure; etc. To model possible variations in preferences, health, and demography, we
could modify the lifetime utility function of (9) to

preference for leisure. The optimal retirement age is then

Ri = g(θ) + ηi ,

(13)

where Ri is the household’s actual retirement age, and ηi is a random error reflecting
deviations from average in ϕi .
Estimating the Structural Parameters Suppose our Euler equation generates an estimate
β̂ of vector β. We calibrate ¯ below. Letting x ≡ −β4 / ln( ¯), the fourth term of (12) yields

x=

If we knew α, (14) would determine γ. The first term in (12) would then pin down ρ.
Our strategy is as follows. We estimate β̂ from consumption Euler equation (11). Then
expression (14) shows that θ = θ(α , β̂). Combining the latter with (13), we estimate α
from a regression of
D
i
Ri = g θ(α , β̂) + ηi .

(15)

Fortunately, one can expect to be able to match any retirement age Ri with an α ∈ [0, 1].
For example, if α = 0, leisure but not consumption yields utility; so, households would
choose never to work at all. If α = 1, on the other hand, consumption but not leisure
yields utility; so, households would choose never to retire.
4. Consumption
We estimate the parameter composites of expression (12) from a GLS linear regression
on equation (11). This section describes our data and results.
CEX Data. The primary data source for this section is the U.S. Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CEX). It is the most comprehensive source of disaggregate consumption data for
20

the U.S. The CEX obtains diary information on small purchases from one set of households; for a second set of households, it conducts quarterly interviews that catalog major
purchases. The survey also collects demographic data and data on value of the respondent’s house. At any given time, the sample consists of approximately 5,000 (7,000 after
1999) households each of which remains in the survey for at most 5 quarters. The survey
was conducted at multi—year intervals prior to 1984, and annually thereafter. This paper
uses the CEX surveys from 1984-2001.8
Table 1 compares National Income and Product Account (NIPA) personal consumption for 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000 with weighted totals from the CEX.9 We exclude
household expenditures on pensions and life insurance from the CEX: the former constitute saving, and our concept of earnings is net of insurance. Looking at the last row of
Table 1, total consumption measured in the CEX is only about 50-70 percent as large as
the NIPA equivalent, with the discrepancy higher in later years.10 This paper assumes that
the NIPA numbers are accurate; that item—nonresponse and other measurement errors of
the survey typically make CEX totals too low; and, that the relative magnitude of survey
errors does not systematically vary with age. Thus, for each year we scale CEX consump-

books, etc., for the CEX. This paper uses raw CEX data from the ICPSR archive, and

We abstract from the empirical diﬀerence between consumption and expenditure (e.g.,
Aguiar and Hurst [2004]). Except in the case of housing, this paper draws no distinction
between consumer durable stocks and flows.
10
There is a particularly large gap for “apparel” in 1985. The 1984 and 1985 data
files omit a number of apparel subcategories. We assume this does not create biases with
respect to age – so that our scaling procedure below is suﬃcient to eliminate the problem.

Section 2, Table 2.4.

Deflating with the NIPA personal consumption deflator, we derive an adjusted consumption amount for each age i and year t. This is our measure of cit . Due to the
construction of the CEX from separate interview and diary surveys, we do not have consumption figures for individual households; however, we can form a pseudo panel of average
household consumption for each age and year. The number of interviewed households per
cell that we use below varies from 127 to 981. The left—hand side variable for our Euler
22

equation is

∆ ln(cit ) ≡ ln(ci+1,t+1 ) − ln(cit ) .
We organize the data so that a household’s age is the age of the wife for a married couple,
and the age of the single household head in other cases.
The CEX provides information on whether the household is married. The latter
provides our regressor nS ∈ {0 , 1}. Although the CEX also reports number of children
ages 0-17, we are interested in the consumption of older children; hence, we construct our
own measure of children per household as follows. Using Census data on births per woman
at age i, i ∈ {15, ..., 49}, in year t ∈ {1920, ..., 2001}, we simulate the number of children
of each age for women of separate ages i in 1984,...,2001.11 As stated, our data set assigns
household observations to each age cell according to the age of the adult woman for all
but single male households. We append numbers of children to each cell on the basis of
the ages and birth dates of women.
Similarly, the CEX survey questions on retirement are not ideal for our purposes.
The CEX interview questionnaire (e.g., http://stats.bls.gov/cex/csxce30201.pdf) only asks
whether the respondent is “retired” if he or she had zero weeks of work in the last twelve
months; therefore, we turn to the March Current Population Survey 1984-2001 for our

χs (Ri ) variable.12 , 13 We consider a household retired if the head is at least 50 years old
and answers that he or she is out of the labor force at the time of the March survey. For
male-female couples, the household is retired for our purposes if the male is at least 50 and
out of the labor market (in the March survey). We focus on male behavior because males
were more attached to the labor force in the cohorts of our data that reach retirement age,
and because our analysis abstracts from a detailed model of decision making within dual
earner households and home—work/market—work choices.
Regression Results. Tables 2-3 present regression results for (11). We use households of
age 20-80 for 1984-2001, so that our diﬀerences ∆ ln(cit ) cover ages 20-79 and years 19842000. Each regression includes separate time dummies for 1984, 1985,..., 1999. The other
independent variables are a constant; presence of a spouse, nS ; retirement status, χ(R);
and, number of children 0-22, nC .
Table 2 provides our estimates of β = (β1 , ..., β4 ). The first column includes households
as young as 20, but we worry that liquidity constraints may bind at the early ages. When
constraints bind, household consumption grows at the same rate as earnings – and faster
than the Euler equation dictates. Columns 2-4 successively exclude ages under 25, 30, and
35. The estimates in columns 2-4 diﬀer substantially from those of column 1 but not from
one another.
Table 3 considers liquidity constraints more systematically. It incorporates all age
groups, but it includes separate dummy variables for ages 20-34. If liquidity constraints
bind in practice at a given age, we expect the corresponding dummy variable to have a

diﬀerent from zero; however, the eﬀect seems to run its course by age 25.
In the end, we restrict our attention to Euler—equation estimates from columns 2-4 of

use column 1, our estimates will be inconsistent.

rate for per capita consumption of 2.6%/yr. That suggests that between, say, ages 25 and
62, in the absence of retirement a household’s consumption per equivalent adult would
rise by a factor of 2.62. In Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987], for instance, the corresponding
factor is about 1.54; in Gokhale et al. [2001], it is 1.74; in Tobin [1967], it is 13.33. For
an infinite—lived representative agent model (e.g., Cooley and Prescott [1995]), the growth
rate of consumption in a steady—state equilibrium would, of course, match the growth rate
26

of GDP.
We estimate that the addition of a spouse raises household consumption by 44 percent.
This closely agrees with the U.S. Social Security System’s award of 50 percent extra benefits
for a spouse. Our estimate implies substantial returns to scale for larger households. Many
papers in the literature set ξ S = 1.0, and Table 2 suggests that such a calibration may be
misleading.
Column 3 estimates a 16 percent drop in consumption at retirement. This is consistent
with, though at the smaller end of, estimates in Bernheim et al. [2001], Banks et al. [1998],
and Hurd and Rohwedder [2003] and the retirement brochures cited in Laitner [2001].14
While our estimate of the decline in expenditure at retirement is relatively modest, it may still represent an overestimate if the timing of retirement is, to some extent,
unanticipated and disproportionately driven by shocks that decrease lifetime income. Our
certainty equivalent model assumes that the relevant risk is fully insured and therefore
does not aﬀect the shape of the age—consumption profile. In reality, however, there may be
uninsured shocks. Unanticipated retirements driven by positive shocks to health or asset
returns, and therefore lifetime income, would likely be associated with discrete increases
in consumption. These cases would tend to bias our estimate of the anticipated change in
consumption at retirement upwards. Conversely, retirements driven by negative, uninsured
shocks would likely be associated with discrete decreases in consumption. To the extent
that retirement is unanticipated, and disproportionately driven by shocks that lower expected lifetime income, our estimates would overstate the degree to which the decline in
consumption at retirement derives from the nonseparability of consumption and leisure.
The non—zero coeﬃcient and large t statistic on “Retired” in Table 3 reject intratem14

Earlier drafts of this paper with less disaggregate treatment of medical expenditures

(recall Appendix I) implied declines of 20 percent or more, but we believe that our current
specification is more accurate.
27

poral additive separability of consumption and leisure – and Section 2 shows that the
rejection does not heavily depend upon the form of our production function.
Table 3’s fourth row indicates an increase in household consumption of 14 percent
for each child age 0-22. Since two parents correspond to 1.44 “equivalent adults,” a child
adds about 20 percent as much as each parent. Mariger [1986] estimates that children
consume 30 percent as much as adults; Attanasio and Browning [1995, p. 1122] suggest
58 percent; Gokhale et al. [2001] assume 40 percent; most of the analysis in Auerbach and
Kotlikoﬀ [1987] implicitly weights children at zero; Tobin [1967] assumes teens consume
80 percent as much as adults, and minor children 60 percent.
One would expect that estimating the coeﬃcient for children would be diﬃcult. Although the date at which a child enters a household is precise, in practice diﬀerent children
leave home at diﬀerent ages. Unfortunately, liquidity constraints may bind exactly when
many children are born (recall that our Euler equation only perceives changes in numbers
of children). Nevertheless, our estimated coeﬃcients on “Child 0-22” have small standard
errors and large t statistics. Our treatment does not, of course, measure reductions in
parental market work hours due to children. Although this omission surely aﬀects one’s
interpretation of our coeﬃcients, Section 5’s earning profiles do reflect women’s actual labor force participation and hours – so this margin of choice enters our analysis in another
way. It may be true as well that parents spend a great deal on children but simultaneously
reduce expenditures on themselves, vicariously enjoying their children’s consumption. The
latter would not invalidate our analysis, but it might, again, suggest a diﬀerent interpretation of the “cost” of children.
One might worry that economywide shocks could aﬀect both general retirement behavior and consumption. Our regressions include year dummies – and they have little
eﬀect on the coeﬃcients of primary interest. Because macroeconomic shocks conceivably
aﬀect consumption diﬀerently at diﬀerent ages, we also perform GLS on a version of (11)
28

in which we average every variable at each age over all years. Although the t statistics
drop because the number of degrees of freedom falls almost 95 percent, the coeﬃcient estimates reconfirm Table 2: for ages 20-79, the new coeﬃcient estimates are, for the constant,
spouse, retired, and child variables, respectively, 0.0276, 0.8398, -0.0698, 0.1367; for ages
25-79, they are 0.0258, 0.4481, -0.1625, 0.1332; for ages 30-79, they are 0.0253, 0.4318,
-0.1589, 0.1298; and, for ages 35-79, they are 0.0230, 0.3025, -0.1507, 0.1137.

5. Retirement
We employ equation (15) to complete the estimation our model’s structural parameters. To determine the utility—maximizing retirement age for (15) from our model, we
need to specify earnings profiles, taxes, and interest rates; for the dependent variable of
a regression of (15), we need empirical retirement ages. For both earning profiles and
empirical retirement ages, this section turns to our second major data source, the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS).
Life Cycle Details. We assume a constant gross—of—income tax real interest rate of
5%/yr.15
15

Our real interest rate comes from a ratio of factor payments to capital over the market

value of private net worth. For the numerator, NIPA Table 1.13 gives corporate business
income, indirect taxes, and total labor compensation. The first less the other two is our
measure of corporate profits; the ratio of profits to profits plus labor remuneration is
“profits share.” We multiply the latter times corporate, noncorporate, and nonprofit—
institution income less indirect taxes. We add household—sector income (NIPA Table
1.13) less indirect taxes and labor remumeration. Finally, we subtract personal business
expenses (brokerage fees, etc. from NIPA Table 2.5.5, rows 61—64). The denominator
is U.S. Flow of Funds household and non—profit institution net worth (Table B.100, row
19), less government liabilities (Table L106c, row 20). We average beginning and end
29

We disregard government transfer payments besides Social Security. Our income tax
rate τ comes from government spending on goods and services less indirect taxes (already
removed from profits, and implicitly absent from wages and salaries below). Dividing by
national income, the average over 1952—2003 is 14.28%/year.16
We assume a payroll tax of 15.3% per year. One—half of Social Security benefits are
subject to the income tax. In the calculations below, the Social Security benefit formula,
including the ceiling on taxable annual earnings, follows the history of the U.S. system.
We assume that adults work 40 hours per week until retirement and 0 hours per week
after retirement. With 16 × 7 waking hours per week, we set17
¯ = 16 × 7 − 40 = .6429 .
16 × 7
Our retirement—age calculation uses a representative household consisting of a husband, wife, and two children. The wife reaches age 65 in the year 2000; the husband is 2
years older; the husband starts work at age 22 and marries at 24, with the latter being the
time at which the household begins; both children are born two years after the marriage;
and, both children leave home at age 22.18 Following U.S. mortality tables, the husband
dies at the end of age 74; the wife dies at the end of age 80. All of our calculations use
2000 dollars; our price index is the NIPA consumption deflator.
of year figures. The average ratio 1952—2003 is .0504. For comparison, Auerbach and
Kotlikoﬀ [1987] use 6.7%/year, Altig et al. [2001] 8.3%/yr., Cooley and Prescott [1995]
7.2%/yr., and Gokhale et al. [2001] use post—tax rates of 4%/yr. and 6%/yr.
16
Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987], for example, use 15%/year.
17
See also Cooley and Prescott [1995] – who, on the basis of time—use studies, determine
that households devote 1/3 of waking hours to work.
18
Notice that assuming two children per household produces a rough match with recent,
slow U.S. population growth.
30

We derive earnings profiles and retirement ages from the original HRS survey cohort,
consisting of households in which the respondent is age 51-61 in 1992. A majority of participant households signed a permission waiver allowing the HRS to link to their Social
Security Administration (SSA) earnings history. Each history runs 1951-1991; the HRS
itself covers 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002. In this paper, we use the HRS and
linked SSA records. For men, we estimate a so—called earnings dynamics model regressing
log earnings on a quadratic in age and dummy variables for time. Our regression error has
an individual eﬀect as well as a random term. The data is right censored at the Social
Security tax cap prior to 1980 and the Medicare tax cap 1980-1991, and our likelihood
function takes this into account. Assuming full—time work until retirement (and no work
thereafter), we predict an average earnings profile for a man who reaches 65 in 1998. Table A1, Appendix II, presents predicted annual earnings. For women, we use the same type
of statistical model to predict earnings above the censoring limit. To allow for women’s
part—time work and absence at some ages from the labor force, we compute average earnings in all other cases from the actual data. We then use the regression time dummies to
deduce an average earnings profile for women who reach 65 in 2000. Again, see Table A1.
Finally, since HRS earnings are net of employer benefits (including health insurance, pension contributions, and employer Social Security tax), we multiply household earnings for
each year by the ratio of NIPA total compensation to NIPA wages and salaries.
We derive Social Security benefits after retirement from the statutory benefit formula
for 2000. Table A1, Appendix II, shows household benefits if the male retires at age 62
and his wife retires simultaneously, at age 60. Given our treatment of consumption, we
must also incorporate a stream of Medicare benefits after age 65, less participant SMI
cost. To do this, for each adult 65 and older, we add to household resources Medicare
benefits equaling the SMI annual premium for 2000 (i.e., $546) multiplied by the ratio of
HI and SMI total expenditures to SMI premiums for 2000 (i.e., 10.7282, less 1). Again,

(male) age of retirement for this cohort is not entirely straightforward because the retirement date of many respondents is not observed. Even in the 2002 wave of the HRS, not
all men have retired, and many men die or leave the survey before retiring. It follows that
an average of the retirement ages among only those observed to have retired will yield a
biased estimate of the population mean.
We use a censored regression to extract an unbiased estimate. Of the 6214 men who
appear in one or more waves of the HRS, 727 retire before age 50 or provide insuﬃcient
information for our analysis. Excluding these, the sample is 5487. Among the latter, 3661
retire by the last available HRS wave, 2002. Their mean retirement age is 60.25. The
remaining 1826 men either (i) died before retiring, (ii) left the survey before retiring, or
(iii) continued to work as of the last interview in 2002. Our analysis treats the 1826 men
as right—censored at their age of death or last interview. The regression equation is

Ri = µ + ηi ,

(16)

with dependent variable and error as in (15). Table 4 presents our estimate of the average
retirement age, µ̂ = 62.57.
Structural Parameter Estimates. Although the preceding discussion might seem to suggest that we need to estimate (15) using a Tobit likelihood function, we can achieve exactly
the same outcome with a two—step procedure as follows: estimate µ̂ from (16); then solve
for the alpha, α̂, that satisfies

Our estimate of theta is θ̂ = θ(α̂ , β̂). The so—called delta method – which uses the
estimated covariance matrix for β̂ and the estimated variance for µ̂ – yields an estimate
of the asymptotic covariance matrix for θ̂.
Table 5 presents our estimates of the structural parameters, with and without liquidity
constraint (8). The estimates of gamma vary from -.49 to -.58; the estimates of alpha vary
from .27 to .28. These correspond to estimates of an IES for services, 1/(1 − γ), of 0.63 to
0.67 and an IES for consumption itself, 1/(1 − α · γ), of 0.86 to 0.88. The estimates of the
subjective time discount rate, ρ, fall between .0117 and .0139. All are statistically diﬀerent
from zero at the 5 percent significance level. As explained above, we favor Euler—equation
estimates that employ data only for ages 25 and beyond; consequently, Table 5 presents
results based on Table 2 coeﬃcients for samples with ages 25-79, 30-79, and 35-79. The
bottom panel of Table 5 shows that liquidity constraint (8) makes little diﬀerence to our
estimation.
As noted in the introduction, our estimates of gamma, alpha, and rho are similar to
a number of calibrations in the literature. For example, Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ’s [1987]

favorite calibration has γ = −3, α (roughly) = .4, and ρ = .015; Altig et al. [2001] use
γ = −3, α (roughly) = .5, and ρ = .004; and, Cooley and Prescott [1995] set γ = 0,
α = .36, and ρ = .053.
Our results may be compared with estimates that have identified the IES from expected changes interest rates. Using aggregate consumption data Hall [1988], Cambell
and Mankiw [1989], and Patterson and Pesaran [1992], for example, estimate the IES for
consumption to be very nearly zero. Micro studies tend to estimate larger intertemporal
elasticities. Banks et al. [1998], for instance, estimate the average IES for consumption to
be approximately 0.5. In another example, Attanasio and Weber [1993] estimate an IES for
consumption of approximately 0.75 from micro data.19 Although we use a very diﬀerent
source of variation to identify the IES, our estimates are similar to, if on the larger end
of, those obtained in micro studies from the change in consumption growth with expected
changes in interest rates.
As a check of the validity of the model, we note that if our a priori beliefs imply that
the subjective rate of time discount must be non-negative (ρ ≥ 0), our constant term in
Table 3 alone puts a lower bound on γ (c.f. Weil [1989]). In particular, suppose that ages
s and t fall before retirement but after liquidity constraint (8) has ceased to bind and that
household composition is the same at both ages. As in (2),

u (cs ) = e(r−ρ)·(t−s) · u (ct ) ;
19

Barsky et al. [1997] use hypothetical questions to estimate an IES distribution for

their sample. They find an average IES of 0.2, with less than 20% of respondents having
an IES greater than 0.3. Others who have attempted to estimate a distribution of intertemporal elasticities of substitution find evidence that the IES is increasing with wealth
(e.g., Blundell et al. [1994]).
35

so, if β1 is our estimated constant from Table 2, we have

u (cs ) = e(r−ρ)·(t−s) · u (cs · eβ1 ·(t−s) )

⇐⇒

r−ρ
= β1 .
1−α·γ

If ρ ≥ 0, it follows that
r
− 1 ≥ −α · γ .
β1
With r = .05 · (1 − .1428), β1 = .0261 from Table 3, and α about .25, we then expect
γ ∈ [−2.56, 1.0]. All of the estimates of Table 5, in fact, fall comfortably within this
interval, though the derivation of Table 5 in no way imposes ρ ≥ 0.
As stated, our estimate of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is closer to
1.0 than many in the literature. Haider and Stephens [2004] argue that earlier—than—
anticipated retirement on the part of some households may bias one’s estimate of the average decline in consumption at retirement upward by one third. Aguiar and Hurst [2004]
argue that the decline tends to be overstated because increases in home production, including shopping time, allow retirees to obtain more consumption per dollar of expenditure.
On the one hand, the latter may be interpreted as somewhat similar in spirit to increased
time for leisure in our model. On the other hand, a smaller empirical decline in consumption at retirement would tend to move our estimated IES even closer to the zero—change
logarithmic case, where the IES is 1.0. For example, if we diminish our consumption drop
by one third in the middle column at the top of Table 5, our point estimates for gamma and
alpha become -.37 and .28, respectively; thus, our point estimate of the IES for consumption/leisure service flows rises from .63 to .73, and our estimate of the IES for consumption
alone rises from .86 to .91.
Finally, we believe that our analysis suggests a coherent description of the practical role
of liquidity constraints in the life—cycle model. Ostensibly, our results seem contradictory:
36

Tables 2-3 show evidence of binding liquidity constraints only through (female) age 22, but
Table 5 finds binding constraints through (female) age 30. One pattern in all solutions of
our model, however, is that constraint (8) binds, if at all, only at the beginning of life. If it
binds then, the reason is that future earnings are high in youth relative to current earnings
– making young households wish they could borrow against their future prosperity. In
comparing our diﬀerent tables, notice that the simulations of Table 5 apply to a cohort
that began working in the mid 1950s. At that time, especially in the 1960s, technological
progress was unusually fast, causing exceptionally rapid earnings growth. The young
households of Tables 2-3, in contrast, began working in the mid 1980s and the 1990s. The
time dummy variables from the male earnings regression generating Table A1 suggest an
average annual rate of technological progress 1960-1970 about 3 percent per year faster
than over 1980-2000. If we fix preference parameters from the middle column of Table 5 but
lower household earnings growth for 1960-69 annually by 2 percent, renormalizing the level
over all years to keep average lifetime earnings the same as before, we find that liquidity
constraint (8) binds only through (female) age 27. If we reduce the growth rate 1960-69
by 3 percent using the same steps, the liquidity constraint never binds at all. Evidently,
having the constraint bind in youth is a knife—edge phenomenon heavily dependent upon
the general rate of earnings growth at the time. In the end, we believe that Tables 2-3 and
5 are fully consistent: according to the model, peak growth rates over the period 1950-2000
can cause young households to hit liquidity constraints for almost their first decade; more
normal macroeconomic growth can make constraint (8) virtually irrelevant.

6. Household Net Worth
In each wave, the HRS collects data on household net worth. This section compares
simulated net worth from our model with the survey data. As preceding sections make
no reference to wealth data, the reader can view the new comparisons as providing an
37

out—of—sample evaluation of our model and parameter estimates. There is a second reason
the new comparisons are interesting: in contrast to many existing studies, our framework incorporates “consumption paradox” behavior, which should tend to decrease wealth
accumulation prior to retirement.
Table A2, Appendix III, presents summary statistics on HRS net worth. Survey “net
worth” consists of financial assets, equity in own business, real estate, and automobiles
– less debt. Our model focuses on married couples, and the table shows that they have
more wealth than average. Although our model implicitly includes private—pension equity
in household net worth, pre—retirement HRS net worth excludes defined—benefit pension
plans; thus, we further specialize our attention to married couples who are retired, and
we capitalize the pension flows that they report. Row 3 of the table shows that retired
couples are somewhat wealthier than couples in general; row 4 shows that private pensions
augment other wealth by about one quarter. Row 5 capitalizes Social Security Benefits as
well, which provides a measure of net worth that is nearly always positive.
We then regress log comprehensive net worth on year, male age, and years since
(male) retirement – see Table A3, Appendix III. The regression restricts the sample to
couples whose male retired at age 59-65, and for each such couple, it uses the first valid
net worth observation. We use log net worth as our dependent variable (omitting the five
observations for which net worth is zero or negative – see Table A2) because we believe the
regressors should register percentage changes. Section 5 estimates an average retirement
age of 62.5; thus, we use the regression of Table A3 to predict comprehensive net worth at
male ages 62 and 63. We make the predictions for households in which the wife (assumed
two years junior to her husband) reaches 65 in the year 2000. In the case of retirement
age 62, for instance, if the standard error for our new net worth regression is s, the new
regression coeﬃcients are (ζ1 , ..., ζ22 ), v ≡ (1, 0, .5, .5, 0, ..., 0), and the matrix of regressors
in Table A3 is X, predicted net worth is

Using maximum likelihood estimates of the covariance matrix for (ζ , s), the delta method
provides a confidence interval.

b. Omitting negative and zero values, we regress log total net worth on a constant,

retired couples whose male retired age 59-65. Assuming wives are two years younger
than their husbands, we predict net worth for households whose wife turned 65 in 2000.

Table 6 compares our model’s simulated net worth at retirement to our corresponding
estimates from the HRS. The estimates of comprehensive net worth at retirement ages 62
and 63 from the data, $719,000 and $736,000, respectively, closely match the corresponding
values from simulations with liquidity constraint (8) – with simulated values from the
39

model being about 5 percent lower than estimates from the data. Simulations based on
formulations of the model without the liquidity constraint are about 10 percent lower than
values from the data. Household heterogeneity, and perhaps measurement error, make the
95 percent confidence intervals for our predictions from the data extremely wide (as the
coeﬃcient of variation in Table A2 foreshadows).
In the end, our simulations quite closely agree with point estimates of comprehensive
net worth from the HRS. We should note, however, that, as is the case with most surveys,
the HRS does not pay special attention to the wealthiest families. The best known survey
that provides a high income sample is the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF
2001 (e.g., Aizcorbe et al. [2003, Table 3]) seems to show noticeably more net worth than
Table A2.20 We think of our model as being calibrated to the U.S. population excluding the
extreme upper tail of the wealth distribution – with an analysis of the latter presumably
requiring a description of intentional bequests (e.g., Modigliani [1986], Laitner [2001], and
others).

7. Conclusions
A number of recent papers describe a substantial drop in household expenditures at
retirement, a drop that some argue demonstrates the limits of a strictly rational life—cycle
model. This paper reconciles the life-cycle saving model with the “retirement-consumption
puzzle,” and then uses the empirical change in expenditure at retirement to provide a new
and, we believe, attractive source of identification for parameters of the life—cycle model.
We show that a tractable life—cycle specification with nonseparable intratemporal
20

We can compare the mean of $342,000 and median $143,000 from row 1 of Table A2

with SCF family net worth (see Aizcorbe) for head 55-64 (2001 dollars): 1995, mean
$442,000 and median $133,000; 1998, mean $579,000 and median $139,000; 2001, mean
$727,000 and median $182,000.
40

utility, and with work options that are discrete, predicts a discontinuous change in consumption at retirement. We then show that if one is willing to thus treat the change in
household consumption at retirement as a consequence of purposeful behavior, the magnitude of the change provides useful information for estimating life—cycle model parameters,
especially the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Intuitively, if a household’s taste for
intertemporal smoothing is suﬃciently high, it will choose to decrease its consumption at
retirement so that lost utility from consumption oﬀsets gains from additional leisure. If it
has a lower desire for intertemporal smoothing, on the other hand, the household might
want to increase its consumption at retirement to take advantage of the complementarity
of consumption and leisure. The size, and sign, of the consumption change play a crucial
role in our estimation of households’ IES.
Our strategy of using the consumption-retirement puzzle to estimate life-cycle parameters provides information about the robustness of existing IES estimates to variation in
method of estimation and decision domain. In addition, our method has the advantage
that it estimates the IES from changes associated with a highly predictable and consequential life event – retirement. The standard approach, which instruments for asset returns
in period t + 1 using economic variables known in period t, suﬀers from the problems of
weak instruments. We argue that, in this sense, changes in consumption at retirement
oﬀer a more robust and credible source of variation from which to estimate this critical
parameter.
We implement our identification strategy using pseudo—panel data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey 1984-2001 to estimate a consumption-Euler equation. The estimated coeﬃcients from that equation provide composites of the structural parameters
of our life—cycle model. As in previous studies, we find a substantial average drop in
household expenditure at retirement. Combining the consumption coeﬃcients with lifetime earnings profiles from Health and Retirement Study panel data, we use the model’s
41

prediction of the optimal retirement age, together with HRS data on retirement, to extract
estimates of the structural parameters of the model.
Despite our distinctive method, we estimate intertemporal elasticity parameters that
are consistent with, if on the higher end of, those found and used in the literature. We
estimate, with considerable precision, an IES for services of approximately 0.67 and an
IES for consumption of 0.87.
Our estimated model performs well when we compare its predictions about retirement
wealth holdings with actual wealth data from the HRS (which did not inform our estimation), and the model interestingly suggests that liquidity constraints may play a role in
determining the path of consumption at young ages. Because the model is especially well
suited for studying retirement behavior, our future work will use our estimates to perform
policy experiments to obtain quantitative predictions of, for example, the eﬀects of possible
Social Security reforms on the labor supply of older Americans.

Appendix I: Three Further Adjustments of the CEX Data
1. We subdivide “shelter” into “services from own house” and “other.” We scale
the latter as we do other categories, but we drop the CEX “services from own house”
and impute a substitute that allocates the annual NIPA total service flow from residential
houses to the CEX in proportion to CEX reported house values.
2. CEX medical expenditures omit employer contributions to health insurance and
services that Medicare covers. We annually, proportionately, and for every age adjust
CEX expenditures on private health insurance to match the Department of Health and
Human Services total for all premiums for private health insurance; and, we adjust out—
of—pocket health spending from the CEX to match annual DHHS totals.21 Turning to
21

See http://www.cms.hhs.gov/statistics/burden-of-health-care-costs/table01.asp. The

annual figures cover 1987-2000. We extrapolate to 1984-86 and 2001 using the growth rate

Medicare, funding for the benefits comes from a hospital insurance (HI) tax on wages
and salaries, monthly premiums for supplementary medical insurance (SMI) from people
currently eligible for benefits, and contributions from general tax revenues to SMI. The
CEX registers only SMI premiums from participants; so, we allocate the yearly total of
Medicare benefits (both HI and all SMI expenditure) to the CEX sample in proportion to
SMI premium payments (principally for people over 65).22
3. The NIPA “personal business” category includes bank and brokerage fees, many
of which are hidden in the form of low interest on saving accounts, etc., and hence absent
from expenditures which CEX households perceive. We assume that bank and brokerage
fees make their way into the life—cycle model in the form of lower—than—otherwise interest
rates on saving; therefore, we normalize annual personal business expenditures measured
in the CEX to match the corresponding NIPA amount less bank and brokerage fees, and
omit bank and brokerage fees from our measure of consumption.

of NIPA total medical consumption.
