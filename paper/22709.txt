ABSTRACT
One of the key terms in contracts between hospitals and insurers is how the parties apportion the
financial risk of treating unexpectedly costly patients. “Prospective” payment contracts give
hospitals a lump-sum amount, depending on the medical condition of the patient, with limited
adjustment for the level of services provided. We use data from the Medicare Prospective
Payment System and commercial insurance plans covering the nonelderly through the Health
Care Cost Institute to measure the extent of prospective payment in 303 metropolitan statistical
areas during 2008-12. We report three key findings. First, commercial insurance payments are
less prospective than Medicare payments. Second, the extent of prospective payment in
commercial insurance varies more than in Medicare, both across hospitals and geographic areas.
Third, differences in prospective payment across hospitals are positively associated with the
extent of hospital competition, the share of the hospital’s commercially insured patients covered
by managed-care insurance, and the share of the hospital’s patients covered by Medicare’s
Prospective Payment System.

Introduction
One of the key terms in contracts between hospitals and insurers is how the
parties apportion the financial risk of treating unexpectedly costly patients. At one
extreme are contracts that pay on a unit-price basis, depending on the treatments that the
hospital and its affiliated physicians determine are medically necessary at the point of
service. These payment systems are sometimes described as “fee-for-service” or “lowpowered.” At the other extreme are contracts that pay on a lump-sum basis, independent
of the level of services provided, depending only on the medical condition of the patient.
These payment systems are sometimes described as “prospective” or “high-powered.”
In practice, payment systems are neither purely fee-for-service nor purely
prospective, but some mix of the two. The optimal mix of fee-for-service and
prospective payment in any particular case involves a tradeoff. On one hand, more
prospective payment gives hospitals incentives to contain costs; on the other hand, it
creates incentives to skimp on the care of and avoid patients who are difficult to treat
(Newhouse 1996; Ellis 1998).
Prospective payment has been extensively studied in the context of the Medicare
program, which has paid hospitals according to its own Prospective Payment System
(PPS) since 1984. However, much less attention has been given to the use of prospective
payment by commercial insurance plans. This is not surprising. The terms of
commercial insurance contracts are the result of confidential bargaining, and until
recently, even the most basic information about these contracts was unknown to most
researchers.
This paper seeks to fill this gap. We use data from the Health Care Cost Institute
(HCCI) on more than 5 million claims from 1,288 hospitals to construct a measure of the

2

extent of prospective payment for inpatient hospital services supplied to nonelderly
commercially-insured patients in 303 metropolitan statistical areas for 2008-12. For each
hospital in each year, we estimate a regression of the log of the hospital’s allowed
amounts (including patient copayments) on a set of Diagnosis-related Group (DRG) fixed
effects; the R2 from these regressions are the hospitals’ commercial insurance
“prospectivity.” We also construct an analogous measure of the extent to which PPS
pays hospitals prospectively; because PPS is the largest single hospital payment system in
the U.S., it is a natural benchmark against which commercial prospectivity can be
compared.
Then, we examine the empirical relationship between our measure of
prospectivity and factors that economic theory suggests might affect the terms of
incentive contracts. One class of models predicts that competition among hospitals can
affect the use of prospective payment, because it may be in the interest of a party with
bargaining power to demand changes to contract terms in addition to high prices (Choi
and Triantis 2012). Economic theory also predicts that preferred-provider (PPO)
insurance products with broad networks, which give insurers less bargaining power with
hospitals, can have the same effect. Finally, research on “spillovers” shows how payment
systems can influence the care of patients other than those to which they apply (e.g.,
Chernew, Baicker, and Martin 2010). For this reason, the share of patients at a hospital
paid by PPS could affect the extent of prospective payment by commercial insurance.
We test the validity of these theories by matching to our prospectivity indices
information on hospital competition, patient insurance mix, and patient demographic and
hospital characteristics. We estimate the effect of these factors on our commercial and

3

Medicare prospectivity indices, holding constant hospital- and time-fixed effects. We
evaluate the economic importance, as well as the statistical significance, of these factors.
Our paper proceeds in four parts. Part I discusses the fundamental rationale behind
prospective payment and the literature on the extent of variation in and the determinants
of contract structure in markets for health care. Part II explains how we use data from
HCCI on commercial insurance claims from Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare to
characterize the extent of prospective payment, and how we supplement the HCCI data
with other information on hospitals and the concentration of their markets. Part III
presents models of the determinants of hospital payment systems and our results, and Part
IV concludes.

I.

Previous research on prospective payment systems and determinants of
contract structure
A large body of theoretical work, summarized by Newhouse (1996), explains the

fundamental tradeoff associated with prospective payment for hospital services. Models
of hospital payment systems generally assume that the unit prices of treatments are
greater than marginal cost, hospital and physician efforts toward cost control are
unobservable, and contracts that specify what treatments are appropriate are incomplete.
Under these assumptions, purely fee-for-service payment encourages treatments that
provide minimal clinical benefit and too little cost control. However, purely prospective
payment encourages hospitals to avoid and skimp on the care of those who are costly to
treat. The conclusion from these models is that the optimal payment system will be
mixed, making hospitals responsible for some, but not all, of the risk of treating
unexpectedly costly patients.

4

The empirical effects of prospective payment have been extensively studied in the
context of the Medicare program, which has paid hospitals according to the Medicare
PPS since 1984. As McClellan (1997) points out, although PPS is prospective in name,
in practice PPS reflects the mixed approach suggested by economic theory.

A hospital’s

PPS payments are primarily based on its patients’ DRGs, but many DRGs are related not
to diagnoses but to the performance of specific intensive procedures. In addition, PPS
provides for additional “outlier” payments that compensate hospitals directly, at least in
part, when a patient has unexpected need for costly additional services. Both of these
factors lead PPS to have some fee-for-service aspects.
Economists and health policy researchers have generally concluded that PPS has
been a success, relative to the almost purely fee-for-service payment system it replaced.
According to a review of the literature by Pauly (2000, p. 557), PPS is widely
acknowledged to have reduced hospitals’ lengths of stay, profit margins, and cost growth
without significant adverse consequences for patient health outcomes. In Europe, public
insurers have been gradually replacing both global budgets and fee-for-service payment
for hospital services with DRG-based systems like PPS (Charlesworth, Davies, and
Dixon 2012).
Fewer papers have studied commercial health insurance payment systems.
Clemens, Gottlieb, and Molnar (2015) find that the schedule of payments for physician
services used by Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Texas is benchmarked to Medicare’s
Resource Based Relative Value Scale for 65 percent of spending. In an analysis of the
hospital payment systems used by four large national insurers in selected metropolitan
areas, Ginsburg (2010) finds that commercial insurance payments to hospitals are less
prospective than PPS. According to him, commercial insurers pay hospitals by DRGs

5

(either with or without outlier payments) in approximately one-third of cases, ranging
from 6 percent in Los Angeles to 44 percent in Milwaukee; the remainder of payments
are made on a per diem or pure fee-for-service basis.
As Ginsburg (2010) observes, this presents a puzzle. In interviews, insurers
expressed a preference for DRG-based payment, and because Medicare and almost all
Medicaid programs pay in this way, its adoption for commercially-insured patients would
reduce hospitals’ transaction costs. Previous research on PPS is consistent with this
anecdotal evidence: there appears to be unclaimed gains from commercial insurance
payment system reform that could be divided among the parties.
One possible explanation is that hospitals with market power can earn higher
profits by demanding not only higher prices but also fee-for-service contracts. Although
this proposition is inconsistent with standard models in which sellers extract rents purely
through higher prices (also known as the “one monopoly profit” hypothesis), these
models may not capture the complexities of markets for health services. For example, if
people who value health services more would prefer their insurer used lower-powered
contracts with providers, then a provider with market power could increase profits by
offering a menu of contracts to price discriminate among insurers. And even if people’s
valuations of health services are homogeneous, it may be in a monopoly seller’s interest
to offer contract terms that would differ from the competitive ones if doing so affected
the price elasticity of demand. Both of these examples can be viewed as special cases of
a market for a good with two attributes where the demand for the attributes is interrelated
(Spence 1975). If this explanation is correct, then failures of competition in hospital
markets might lead not only to high prices – as previous research (e.g., Cooper et al.

6

2015) has shown – but also to fee-for-service payment that may discourage efficient
production and contribute to health care cost growth.
Economic theory also suggests that PPO insurance with broad networks will be
more likely to use lower-powered payment approaches. An insurer designing a broadnetwork product has less bargaining leverage with hospitals, thereby enabling them to
exercise what market power they have more fully. In addition, by reducing any single
hospital’s patient volume, broad-network products increase both the risk and the
transaction costs to the hospital of payment reform. For these reasons, understanding the
extent to which commercial insurance hospital payment systems are prospective, and the
determinants of commercial payment systems’ prospectivity, are important health policy
issues.
Two empirical papers present evidence consistent with this explanation. Gift,
Arnould, and DeBrock (2002) analyze 1995 data on contract form from a large insurer in
Washington state, matched with data on hospital characteristics from the Washington
Department of Health, for 83 acute-care facilities. They found 34 of the 83 hospitals
used some form of prospective payment, and that the number of hospitals within 10 miles
was positively associated with the probability of prospective payment. Town, Feldman,
and Kralewski (2011) analyze data from 83 medical groups that contracted with
Minnesota Blue Cross’s “Blue Plus” plan in 2001, matched with data on medical group
characteristics from the Community Tracking Survey. They found that share of revenue
from capitation was positive associated with the number of physicians in the practice
relative to the total number of physicians within 15 km, and with physicians’ selfreported assessment of their practice’s market power.

7

Although these papers are suggestive, both have significant limitations. Both are
based on selected small samples of facilities or practices from a single geographic area,
and data from an earlier time period in which markets for health services were different
from today. The research design of both is cross-sectional, leaving open the possibility
that the observed association between payment system and competition may be due to
other, unmeasured characteristics of hospitals or areas. Finally, neither study provides a
general way to quantify the extent of prospective payment in commercial insurance and
compare it to a practical benchmark like PPS.
Our paper seeks to address these limitations. We use nationwide data on
payments to hospitals from HCCI to characterize the payment systems used by Aetna,
Humana, and UnitedHealthcare. The HCCI data includes information on the inpatient
hospital claims for approximately 40 million individuals from all 50 states from 20082012, accounting for 27% of the nonelderly population covered by commercial insurance,
making it one of the largest data bases on the privately insured ever assembled. We also
use data from the Medicare program in order to compare the extent of prospective
payment in HCCI to the extent of prospective payment in PPS, and investigate whether
prospective payment is correlated with hospital market competition and patient insurance.
We hold constant hospital fixed effects, in order to control for all time-invariant
characteristics of hospitals and geographic areas, as well as patient insurance type and a
set of time-varying hospital characteristics.

8

II.

Data
We use data from three sources: HCCI, the American Hospital Association

(AHA) Survey, and the Medicare program. Each HCCI hospital claim includes the
Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and the “allowed amount,” representing the actual
amount paid to the facility by the plan plus any deductibles or copayments. The HCCI
data also contain information on each patient’s age, gender, and type of insurance (health
maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), or point-ofservice (POS)).
We follow McClellan (1997) and characterize the extent of each hospital’s
prospective payment by the share of its payments’ variance that is explained by its
patients’ DRGs. This approach has several strengths. First, contracts between hospitals
and insurers share costs of treating difficult patients in many ways. Although some cost
sharing occurs through outlier payments, cost sharing also occurs other terms such as allinclusive per diem rates. This approach aggregates these different forms of cost sharing
into a single index proportional to revenues governed by each. Second, our commercial
insurance claims contain information on the DRG of each patient’s admission, even for
claims not paid on a DRG basis. Because DRGs are the basis for PPS (as well as most
states’ Medicaid hospital payment systems), they have become a standard claims
characteristic. Third, for the same reason, DRG-based payment is a practical option
against which commercial insurance contracts can be evaluated.
For each hospital in each year 2008-2012, we calculate two prospective payment
indices: one for commercial insurance and one for PPS. For each hospital in each year
2008-2012, we estimate two regressions of payments (including deductibles and
copayments made by beneficiaries) on a set of DRG fixed effects. The R2 from the

9

regression of the log of commercial payments is the hospital’s commercial prospectivity;
the R2 from the regression of the log of PPS payments is the hospital’s PPS prospectivity.
To each index, we match data on the distribution of the hospital’s patients’ age,
gender, and insurance type; on hospital characteristics from AHA; and on hospital
markets derived from Medicare claims. AHA hospital characteristics include teaching
status, ownership (private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public), number of beds (<100,
100-300, >300), system status, and vertical integration with physicians. Following
previous work (Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler 2014), we divide vertically integrated
hospitals into four groups: fully integrated organizations, closed physician/hospital
organizations, open physician/hospital organizations, and independent practice
associations. We use Medicare inpatient hospital claims from 2008-2012 to construct a
measure of hospital market competitiveness, equal to the patient-flow-weighted average
of the Hirschman-Herfindahl indices of admissions in each patient residential zip code
served by the hospital, according to the method in Kessler and McClellan (2000). We
limit our analysis to general medical/surgical, non-federal hospitals in metropolitan
statistical areas outside of Maryland1 with at least 100 HCCI admissions in all of the
years 2008-2012.
Tables 1 and 2 report the mean, standard deviation, and percentiles (for selected
variables) of the variables used in analysis. All of these variables are measured at the
hospital level; all descriptive statistics are weighted by the number of admissions. Table
1 shows that the extent of prospectivity in commercial insurance payments to hospitals is
lower and more variable than the extent in PPS. In 2008, for example, the average R2

1

Hospitals in Maryland are exempt from Medicare PPS. Medicare and commercial insurance hospital
reimbursement schedules in Maryland are determined by an all-payer system governed by the Maryland
Health Services Cost Review Commission.

10

from a regression of commercial claims’ allowed amounts on a set of DRG indicator
variables is 0.747; by comparison, the average R2 from a regression of total payments
under Medicare PPS on DRG indicators is 0.952. Even those hospitals with the most
prospective commercial payments were not paid by commercial insurers as prospectively
as they were paid by PPS: the 90th percentile of commercial prospectivity across
hospitals is 0.841, whereas the 10th percentile of PPS prospectivity is 0.939. This is not
surprising: Medicare uses a single nationwide reimbursement system that is based on
DRGs, whereas commercial insurers use multiple reimbursement systems which may or
may not be DRG-based. By 2012, the level of commercial prospectivity had increased by
almost one-half of a standard deviation, to 0.776; this occurred primarily because of
increases in prospectivity at the bottom of the distribution.
Table 1 also reports the 2008 and 2012 distributions of the hospital HirschmanHerfindahl index; the share of commercial admissions attributable to HMO, POS, and
PPO enrollees; the share of Medicare admissions (the number of Medicare admissions
divided by the total as reported to AHA); and the number of commercial and Medicare
PPS admissions per DRG. The most striking trend in these variables is the shift among
the commercially insured from HMO and PPO to POS insurance. The prevalence of POS
insurance increased by 11.5 percentage points, whereas the prevalence of HMO and PPO
insurance each decreased by around 6 percentage points. Table 2 reports 2012 means and
standard deviations of the other independent variables, including the characteristics of
commercial and Medicare PPS patients and of hospitals.
Table 3 shows that the extent of prospectivity in hospital reimbursement varies
not only across hospitals but also across geographic areas. The table reports selected
characteristics of the five largest CBSAs, in terms of commercial admissions, in each

11

quartile of the prospectivity distribution. The table shows that the weighted-average
share of hospital payment variance explained by DRG dummies ranges from 70-73% in
low-prospectivity areas (such as Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL) to 8084% in high-prospectivity areas (such as Minneaspolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN). The
table also shows that Medicare PPS prospectivity is roughly constant across areas,
ranging from 94-96% nationwide. Finally, the table shows that the extent of
prospectivity is not obviously related to the average commercial price of a hospital
admission. According to the fourth column, some CBSAs in both the lowest and the
highest prospectivity quartiles have high commercial prices, and some have low
commercial prices. However, this simple, cross-sectional bivariate analysis does not
account for variation across areas or over time in insurance types or the characteristics of
patients, hospitals, or hospital markets, and so does not indicate whether there is an
association between hospital competitiveness and the extent of prospective payment.

III.

Models and Results
For this reason, we model the commercial payment prospectivity of hospital i in

year t, Yit, as linear functions of the following variables, weighting each observation in
the regression by the number of commercial admissions:
Yit = αi + θt + HHIitβ + Xitγ + Vitδ1 + Witδ2 + Zitδ3 + εit,
with
αi

hospital fixed effects;

θt

time fixed effects;

HHIit Hirschman-Herfindahl index;

12

Xit

insurance mix -- the proportion of commercial patients with HMO, POS, or PPO
insurance (reference category is proportion PPO) and the proportion of all patients
who are Medicare PPS2;

Vit

age and gender mix -- the proportion of patients aged 0-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44,
45-54, and 55-64 years (reference category is proportion aged 55-64) and female;

Wit

hospital characteristics (described above);

Zit

number of admissions per DRG3; and

εit

an error term which we allow to be arbitrarily correlated within each hospital over
time.
We also estimate the parameters in the equation above substituting hospitals’ PPS

prospectivity for their commercial prospectivity as a placebo test. If the estimates of the
effects of HHIit and Xit from the commercial models are causal, then those variables
should have no impact on PPS prospectivity: PPS is a single, national program that is
defined by statute, so market factors should not affect it. In the models that use PPS
prospectivity as the dependent variable, we omit the proportion of commercial patients
with HMO, POS, or PPO insurance; substitute the proportion of patients aged 65-69, 7074, 80-89, and 90-99 years in Medicare (reference category is proportion aged 75-79) for
the commercial patient age mix; and weight each observation by the number of PPS
admissions.
Table 4 presents estimates of the hospital HHI, insurance type, and time on the
extent of commercial and PPS prospectivity. According to the leftmost two columns,

2

We include the proportion of patients who are Medicare PPS to test for the presence of spillovers from
Medicare to commercial insurance.
3
We include the number of admissions per DRG to account for the possibility of a mechanical relationship
between our measure of prospectivity and the concentration of admissions across DRGs within a hospital,
which could bias our results if the concentration of admissions across DRGs within a hospital were
correlated with the concentration of admissions across hospitals.

13

hospital market competition is significantly associated with increases in commercial
prospectivity, holding constant hospital- and time-fixed effects, insurance type, and the
characteristics of patients and hospitals. In particular, moving a hospital from the 75th to
the 25th percentile of the 2012 HHI would lead to an increase in commercial prospectivity
of 1.2 percentage points.4 Insurance type also has a statistically significant effect on
commercial prospectivity. For plausible shifts in the mix of a hospital’s commercial
payors, the effect of insurance type is small: moving half of the average hospital’s 2012
PPO patients to HMO or POS insurance (i.e., 6 percentage points) would lead to an
increase in commercial prospectivity of 0.4 percentage points.5 The effect of the
proportion of patients paid under PPS is somewhat larger. For example, increasing the
proportion of PPS patients from the 25th to the 75th percentile (i.e., by 10 percentage
points) would lead to an increase in commercial prospectivity of 1 percentage point.6
Taken together, these three factors explain an economically important (although not a
majority) of the differences in prospectivity across hospitals. In 2012, for example,
plausible shifts in hospital market competitiveness and insurance type could account for
approximately 2.6 percentage points of the 8.9-percentage-point difference between the
25th and 75th percentile of the prospectivity distribution, or approximately 30 percent.
By contrast, according to the rightmost two columns of Table 4, hospital HHI and
the proportion of patients paid under PPS do not have a statistically significant or
economically important effect on PPS prospectivity. This is consistent with a causal
interpretation of the estimated effects of HHI and insurance type on commercial
prospectivity; the observed correlation between these variables in the commercial context

0.012 ≈ (0.408 – 0.235) * -0.068.
0.004 ≈ 0.06 * 0.060.
6
0.010 ≈ 0.10 * 0.097.

is not due to an artifact of our prospectivity measure, or to differential trends in case mix
or hospital payments across hospitals over time, at least insofar as these trends would be
reflected in Medicare PPS payments.

IV.

Conclusion
Health economists have analyzed extensively the implications of “prospective” or

“high-powered” payment for hospital services. A vast literature has modeled
theoretically the tradeoffs associated with prospective payment, and many studies have
investigated the empirical consequences of Medicare’s adoption of its own particular
Prospective Payment System (PPS). Wide agreement in the health policy community
that PPS successfully lowered relatively unproductive health spending has led researchers
to propose extending the principles underlying it, in the form of “bundled payment”
systems (Miller et al. 2011).
Despite this, much less attention has been given to the determinants, or even the
extent, of prospective or high-powered payment by commercial insurance plans. This
gap is important. There is some evidence that commercial plans make less use of highpowered payment incentives than Medicare, and theoretical reasons to believe that this is
due at least in part to failures in markets for hospital services or health insurance. Yet,
little work has sought to test whether these hypotheses are correct, or even to assess the
extent of prospective payment in commercial insurance at all.
In this paper, we use data from HCCI, the Medicare program, and the American
Hospital Association survey to investigate the association between the extent of
prospective payment in commercial insurance, patient insurance mix, and hospital market
competitiveness. We report three key findings. First, the extent of prospectivity in

15

commercial insurance payments to hospitals is lower and more variable than the extent in
PPS, although the extent of commercial insurance prospectivity has been slowly
increasing over time. Second, the extent of prospectivity in payment systems varies not
only across hospitals but also across geographic areas. Third, differences in hospitallevel payment prospectivity is positively associated with three factors: the extent of
hospital competition, the share of the hospital’s commercially insured patients covered by
managed-care insurance, and the share of the hospital’s patients covered by PPS. We
show that plausible differences in these three factors can explain around 30 percent of the
variation in hospital-level prospectivity that we observe.
Our results have important implications for economic theory and public policy.
The fact that hospitals facing less competition are more likely to be paid on a fee-forservice basis means that the “one monopoly profit” hypothesis does not accurately
characterize markets for hospital services. This result also indicates a channel other than
price through which hospital market power may affect social welfare: the terms of
contracts with insurers. Although (as we discuss below) we are not able to say
definitively whether the reduction in commercial payment prospectivity in uncompetitive
hospital markets is harmful to consumers, the fact that even in competitive markets
commercial payment prospectivity is significantly below that of PPS – which is widely
viewed as a success – is cause for concern.
We also find that insurance mix significantly affects the extent of commercial
payment prospectivity. Hospitals serving patients with HMO or POS insurance have
higher-powered incentives than do those serving patients with PPO insurance. This
finding is consistent with both economic theory and anecdotal evidence. PPOs generally
have broader hospital networks than do HMO or POS products, which gives each

16

participating hospital less patient volume, thereby reducing insurers’ bargaining power
and increasing transaction and risk-bearing costs to hospitals. Recent analysis of a
demonstration project to implement higher-powered payment incentives in commercial
insurance contracts in California cited inadequate patient volume as the single largest
reason the project did not succeed (Ridgely et al. 2014). In addition, we find that
hospitals with a higher proportion of patients paid by PPS have higher-powered
commercial payment incentives. This is consistent with evidence that changes to
incentives for treatment of one patient population “spillover” to outcomes of other
populations (e.g., Chernew, Baicker, and Martin 2010), and that changes in Medicare
payment systems can facilitate private payment reform (Clemens and Gottlieb,
forthcoming).
Our analysis has at least three limitations. First, we do not observe any actual
contracts between insurers and hospitals; our analysis is based on a measure of contracts’
payment incentives that we construct from claims data. Although there are strong
reasons to believe that our measure is correlated with the terms of the underlying
agreements, this is an assumption that we cannot test. Second, because our analysis is
observational in nature, the association we observe between prospectivity, hospital
market competition, and insurance mix may be due to an unobserved factor rather than a
causal connection. To address this concern, we control for hospital- and time-fixed
effects and the time-varying characteristics of hospitals and patient populations;
nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of an unobserved time-varying
characteristic of hospitals or geographic areas that is correlated with both prospectivity
and market structure. Third, because we do not examine patient health outcomes or
health spending, we cannot make a definitive welfare assessment of the reduced

17

prospectivity we observe in uncompetitive hospital markets. Although previous
empirical work on PPS suggests that the use of low-powered payment in commercial
insurance is inefficient, future research should consider this hypothesis directly.
