Financial Protectionism: the First Tests
Andrew K. Rose and Tomasz Wieladek
NBER Working Paper No. 17073
May 2011
JEL No. F36,G21
ABSTRACT
We provide the first empirical tests for financial protectionism, defined as a nationalistic change in
banks’ lending behaviour, as the result of public intervention, which leads domestic banks either to
lend less or at higher interest rates to foreigners. We use a bank-level panel data set spanning all British
and foreign banks providing loans within the United Kingdom between 1997Q3 and 2010Q1. During
this time, a number of banks were nationalised, privatised, given unusual access to loan or credit guarantees,
or received capital injections. We use standard empirical panel-data techniques to study the “loan
mix,” domestic (British) loans of a bank expressed as a fraction of its total loan activity. We also study
effective short-term interest rates, though our data set here is much smaller. We examine the loan
mix for both British and foreign banks, both before and after unusual public interventions such as nationalisations
and public capital injections. We find strong evidence of financial protectionism. After nationalisations,
foreign banks reduced the fraction of loans going to the UK by about eleven percentage points and
increased their effective interest rates by about 70 basis points. By way of contrast, nationalised British
banks did not significantly change either their loan mix or effective interest rates. Succinctly, foreign
nationalised banks seem to have engaged in financial protectionism, while British nationalised banks
have not.

1. Introduction
The “Great Recession” which engulfed the world in 2008-09 is frequently compared
to the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Many economists blame trade protectionism for
deepening, spreading, and/or lengthening the Great Depression. This time around, there is
only muted evidence of traditional trade protectionism, at least thus far.3 But the public
sector has made substantial interventions in financial markets around the world, particularly
in the banking sector, while cross-border bank lending has fallen. In this study we ask if
government support for banks has reduced foreign lending and resulted in a new type of
protectionism: financial protectionism.
We think of financial protectionism as a nationalistic change in banks’ lending
behaviour, as the result of public intervention, which leads domestic banks either to lend
less or at higher interest rates to foreigners. While the idea of financial protectionism has
been discussed informally for some time, to the best of our knowledge no other work has
ever formally tested for the presence of financial protectionism in bank lending behaviour.4
The lack of previous empirical work is not surprising to us, as publicly available data are
typically aggregated and do not provide sufficient information to test this hypothesis
rigorously. In this study, we take advantage of a panel data set on bank activity collected by
the Bank of England. This data set covers all banks, both foreign and domestic, which
operated in the UK, a rich country with a large international financial sector. Our data
spans 1997Q3 through 2010Q1, a period characterized by the most significant international
financial crisis in decades, during which a number of British and foreign banks were
nationalised or supported with capital injections and/or loan guarantees. Concurrently, most
British and foreign banks did not need to rely on explicit state support for their survival. As
such, this heterogeneity means that our data set is ideally suited to testing for financial
protectionism.

1

We use a standard panel data model with period- and bank-specific fixed effects to
search for financial protectionism. Our main focus is the fraction of domestic (British) loans
a bank makes as a fraction of its total loan activity, a ratio we refer to as the “loan mix,”
though we also investigate interest rates. Our key finding is that after nationalisation,
foreign banks reduced British as a share of total lending by about eleven percentage points,
and increased interest rates on new loans to UK residents by 70 basis points. By way of
comparison, nationalisation does not seem to affect either the lending or interest rate
decisions of British banks. These results are robust to a variety of perturbations to the
underlying empirical model. Succinctly, foreign nationalised banks seem to have engaged in
financial protectionism, which British nationalised banks have not.

2. Data and Methodology

2.1 The Data Set

Strategy. Our objective in this study is to test for financial protectionism in an
unabashedly empirical fashion.5 The aggregate data series lends at least prima facie
plausibility to the idea that lenders cut back more dramatically on their cross-border activity
than on their domestic activity. Figure 1 plots the growth of lending to British business over
the past few years. The superficial impression one gets is that during the Great Recession,
foreign lenders (taken to mean banks with headquarters outside the UK) contracted their
activity more dramatically than British lenders (banks with headquarters in the UK). But
such aggregate evidence provides at most indirect support for the presence of financial
protectionism.6 Only if foreign public institutions contracted their British loans more than
foreign private institutions, would we have strong prima facie evidence of financial
protectionism.
We are interested in examining if public interventions, such as bank privatisation or
nationalisation, skew either the prices that banks charge for foreign (as opposed to domestic)
loans, or their quantity. Most publicly available data sets provide insufficient information to
answer this question rigorously. For instance, the BIS provides two data sets on cross2

border bank lending, “locational” (e.g., Buch, 2003) and “consolidated” (e.g., Rose and
Spiegel, 2004). However, neither allows one to differentiate domestic from foreign lending,
let alone lending for e.g., nationalised as opposed to private banks. Laeven and Valencia
(2010) study systemic banking crises and provide data on bank nationalisations during these
crises. However, these authors use aggregated data and are also unable to differentiate the
effects of public intervention on domestic as opposed to foreign financial activity. Since
aggregation may thus mask the effects of financial protectionism, it is best to test for this
phenomenon using data at the institution specific level. For such reasons, it seems natural
to test for financial protectionism at the level of individual institutions. However, publicly
available disaggregated databases such as BankScope do not provide information on
individual institutions’ external claims.7 A good test for financial protectionism requires
data on both external and domestic lending at the level of individual institutions, some of
which were affected by public interventions during the sample period.

Source of Financial Data. Fortunately, for the purposes of this investigation, the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Division at the Bank of England have kindly provided us
with an appropriate data set. It includes quarterly data with a host of information for all
banks resident in the UK.8 London’s status as a major international financial centre means
that the banking system of the UK has considerable diversity, enabling us to search credibly
for indications of financial protectionism in the behaviour of both British and foreign banks.
This rich dataset is substantially better suited to test for financial protectionism than
publicly available datasets. Unfortunately, it has a substantive disadvantage for academic
research; for obvious reasons, the data set is confidential.
The data set provides us with a complete set of balance sheet data for every
institution in the UK banking sector, as all banks operating in the UK must provide this
information to the Bank of England under the present regulatory regime.9 Internally, the
Bank of England uses this confidential data set to help carry out its financial and monetary
stability objectives. Externally, the data is passed on the FSA for the purposes of bank
regulation and to the Office of National Statistics, where it features as one of the building
blocks of the UK’s national accounts. Since the accuracy of this data set potentially affects a
3

host of economics spheres, there is every reason to believe that the Bank of England takes its
measurement seriously.
Reporting institutions must provide the data to the Bank of England in several
“forms.” The “AL” form of the dataset provides disaggregated loans and advances granted to
UK residents (including monetary and financial institutions). The “CC” form provides
disaggregated series on a reporting institution’s total claims on non-residents.10 We combine
AL and CC series to derive our key regressand, the “loan mix” ratio. The loan mix measures
the ratio of British to total bank lending, and is our dependent variable of choice. The data
set on loan mix is available quarterly from 1997Q3 until 2010Q1 for a total of 487 banks (not
all of which have complete series). As of May 2010, 56 of these banks are British according
to the Bank of England, while the rest are foreign. Further details on the construction of
our variables are available in the data appendix.
British banks seem naturally to lend more inside the UK, at least compared with
foreign banks. This is clear from Figure 2, which provides histograms of the loan mix for
British and foreign banks. The behaviour of the loan mix ratio suggests that British banks
tend naturally to lend relatively more at home (the distribution is skewed towards one),
while foreign banks lend more abroad (the distribution is skewed towards zero). This does
not necessarily indicate financial protectionism, since Figure 2 combines data from publiclyowned, privately-owned banks, and a number of banks whose ownership switched. The
question we ask is whether a bank’s behaviour – that is, its loan mix – changes following a
large public intervention. Regression analysis of the loan mix permits us to explore whether
or not a bank changes its preferences for domestic, as opposed to foreign, lending, following
events like nationalisation.
Data on loan rates provides us with an alternative, inferior, way to test for financial
protectionism. In particular, the “ER” form provides information on disaggregated effective
interest rates on new loans, weighted by loan size.11 Unfortunately, these data are available
over a shorter span of time (only from 2004Q1), and only for the largest institutions (though
these collectively make up three-quarters of total lending to any particular sector).12

4

We also take advantage of data provided by the “BT” and “PL” forms, which contain
in-depth information of the reporting institution’s balance sheet and income/expenditure
statement, respectively. The additional data from these forms are used to construct several
control variables such as the non-performing loan ratio and measures of capital adequacy,
liquidity, and profitability.

Source of Public Intervention Data. Which of the (487) banks in our sample have
been affected by public interventions during the sample period? In early August 2010, we
conducted bank-by-bank Google searches for ‘ “bank name” nationalisation nationalise
privatize’ where “bank name” was the precise name of the individual bank in question
(according to the Bank of England data set). The clues we discovered from these searches
lead us to investigate approximately 150 banks in detail. As we found convincing evidence
of public interventions, we constructed suitable binary dummy variables (which take on the
value of one at the time of and after public intervention, and are otherwise zero).
Subsequently we discovered a number of disaggregated data sets on public interventions in
banks; we have used these to check and corroborate our classifications.13
We gathered data on four types of public intervention: 1) nationalisations, 2)
privatisations, 3) injections of public capital, and 4) unusual access to loans, guarantees or
liquidity. We focus on bank nationalisations in our empirical work. When a bank receives
a public capital injection, it is difficult to measure the government’s effective influence on
the bank, since private bank capital is difficult to measure during the very times of crisis
when capital is injected. Some banks received capital injections that were minor compared
with their existing capital; they remained, for the most part, private institutions. Other
banks were essentially nationalised when they received capital injections. For this reason, it
seems unwise to assume that all banks treat capital injections similarly. Access to unusual
liquidity facilities or loan guarantees is even more problematic, since these forms of
assistance are quite heterogeneous.14 Further, capital injections and other forms of public
assistance can occur repeatedly; the effect of such assistance is also likely to be
heterogeneous, especially since repeated rescues are sometimes implicitly guaranteed in
advance. Nationalisation, by way of contrast, is a more clear-cut and discrete event.
5

Nationalisation is also more discrete than bank privatisation (which is often spread over
period of time). Since bank privatisation tends to occur during periods of tranquillity, the
associated effects on lending decisions are not likely to be “the opposite” of bank
nationalisation, which occurs in times of crisis. For all these reasons, bank nationalisation
seems like the most obvious measure of public intervention likely to result in detectable
financial protectionism. Figure 3 provides a set of four histograms for British banks; three
present public interventions and the last presents “tranquil” observations (i.e., those without
any intervention). Each histogram graphs the number of relevant observations, organized
into bins corresponding to the loan mix.

2.2 Methodology
We begin to explore our data set with a simple panel data model. We start by
estimating the following regression equation:

Domi,t/(Domi,t+Fori,t) = αi + βt + γNati,t + γUKNatUK,i,t + δPrivi,t + δUKPrivUK,i,t
+ ζCapi,t + ζUKCapUK,i,t + θLLi,t + εi,t

(1)

where:


Domi,t is lending to domestic (British) residents by bank i at time t;



For is lending to foreign residents;



{αi} is a comprehensive set of bank-specific fixed effects;



{βt} is an analogous set of time fixed effects;



Nati,t is a dummy variable which takes a value of one when a British bank i is
nationalised at or before time t, minus one if a foreign bank is nationalised at or
before time t, and is otherwise zero;



NatUK,i,t is a dummy variable which takes a value of one when British bank i is
nationalised at or before time t, and is otherwise zero;
6



Priv, Cap, and LL are analogues for banks that are privatised, the recipients of public
capital injections, and receive unusual access to liquidity, or loan guarantees;



ε is a well-behaved disturbance term;



{γ}, {δ}, {ζ}, and {θ} are coefficients.

The coefficients of greatest interest to us are γ and γUK . They measure the permanent effect
of bank nationalisation on the loan mix. We note in passing that our loan mix regressand is
unaffected by changes in total lending.
Financial protectionism might be expected to result in British banks increasing the
share of British loans in their loan portfolios following a public intervention like
nationalisation; symmetrically, foreign banks might be expected to reduce the British share
of their loan mix.15 That is, we have constructed our dummy variable such that financial
protectionism, if it exists, would be manifest in a positive and significant γ coefficient. Of
course, British and foreign responses to nationalisation may not be similar quantitatively.
Accordingly, we check whether the behaviour of public interventions is the same for British
and foreign owned banks. We also do not assume but instead check for the equality of
responses to different public interventions (like nationalisation, capital injections, and so
forth).
We estimate our equation with least squares, though we provide a variety of
alternative estimators below to ensure the robustness of our results. We present robust
standard errors that are clustered by time, though again we also check that our results are
not sensitive to this assumption. We cluster by time since public interventions in our
sample are in practice temporally concentrated. Table 1 provides some relevant evidence; it
tabulates the proportion of different interventions in particular periods of time. Half of all
bank nationalisations in the sample took place during the second half of 2008 when the
financial crisis was at its peak. Other interventions (such as public capital injections) are
even more concentrated.

7

3. Results
3.1 Lending
Estimates of equation (1) are presented in Table 2. Our interest in this table is
mostly in checking for two types of symmetry: a) between different types of public
interventions (nationalisations, capital injections and so forth); and b) between British and
foreign bank responses to public interventions. Since there were no British bank
privatisations during our data sample, we can only test the symmetry between British and
foreign responses to nationalisations, public capital injections, and unusual access to loan or
liquidity facilities. We begin with that task.
The results in Table 2 indicate that there is a statistically negligible difference
between British and foreign access to both capital injections and unusual loan or liquidity
facilities. Both δUK and ζUK are not only statistically insignificant at conventional levels but
have the same signs as δ and ζ. When we test the restriction δUK=ζUK=0, the restriction is
consistent with the null hypothesis at better than the .2 confidence level. The same cannot
be said of the British and foreign responses to bank nationalisation; the loan mix of British
banks responds much less to a degree that is both economically and statistically significant.
Accordingly, we impose the reasonable restrictions (of symmetric responses to British and
foreign capital injections and unusual access to loan/liquidity facilities) and re-estimate our
equation; these estimates are presented in the right-hand column. The results are tabulated
in the column at the right of Table 2.
Our chief interest is the effect of bank nationalisation on the loan mix.
Nationalisation seems to have a significant effect on the loan mix; foreign bank reduce their
proportion of British to total lending by over ten percentage points. This is a large economic
effect, which is also highly statistically significant; the t-statistic for the hypothesis of no
effect is 5.3. It is also interesting to note that the coefficient on the British nationalisation
dummy variable is of almost identical magnitude but opposite sign; that is, British bank
nationalisation appears to have no economically (or statistically) significant effect on the
loan mix. The substantive evidence of financial protectionism after foreign bank
8

nationalisation is our most striking finding, especially when combined with the absence of
any indication of a comparable reaction by British banks.
The results of Table 2 indicate that other public interventions also have effects on the
loan mix. These effects differ by the type of intervention. Banks that are granted unusual
access to loan or liquidity facilities seem to engage in financial protectionism; British banks
raise the proportion of British loans in their portfolios by almost three percentage points
(foreign banks lower their British loan mix by the same amount). Capital injections have a
smaller effect which is curiously negatively signed, indicating that foreign banks which
receive public capital actually increase the proportion of British loans in their portfolios,
though only by a small amount (just over one percentage point). Privatised foreign banks
reduce the proportion of British loans by over ten percentage points, a statistically and
economically significant amount. Unfortunately, some of these results are sensitive to
minor econometric assumptions, as we now show.
3.2 Sensitivity Analysis
Table 3 checks the robustness of our key results in twelve different ways; each row in
the table represents a separate least squares regression. Since a) there are no British bank
privatisations during the sample and b) foreign British and foreign bank nationalisations
have separate effects, we replace our “symmetric” (+1 British/0/-1 Foreign) dummy variables
with conventional (+1/0) dummy variables.
We begin by using an alternative definition of our dependent variable; specifically,
we replace CC15 (Total external claims on non-resident customers) in the denominator with
CC1 (Loans and advances to non-residents). Our key nationalisation results using the two
ratios are very similar, though coefficient estimates for other interventions vary somewhat
in significance. Next we check that our standard error assumptions are not critical by
providing two alternatives; robust standard errors that are not clustered, and traditional
standard errors. The statistical significance of our nationalisation results is unaffected,
though different standard errors do affect the significance of other public interventions.

9

Next, we weight our least squares regressions in two different ways: by the natural
logarithm of total bank loans (the denominator of our loan mix dependent variable), and by
the log of total assets. Neither of these checks appears to affect the results much. Adding
these variables as controls (instead of weighting by them) also seems to affect the results
little. Since the loan mix is a limited dependent variable, we also estimate our equation with
an appropriate censored technique (Tobit), but again this does not affect our results much.16
We also cut our sample of data in a number of different ways. First, we divide the
sample into big and small banks, using the median bank loan portfolio (the denominator of
our dependent variable) as the dividing point. The results differ by bank size; bigger banks
that are nationalised seem to engage in more financial protectionism, as seems intuitive.
The responses of smaller banks to public interventions are not statistically significant from
zero. Next, we check whether our results are sensitive to the inclusion of particular
observations. Our results are little affected by dropping the earlier part of our sample, ,
though the privatisation effect drops by an order of magnitude. Our last test in this vein is
to drop all observations with a residual which lie more than two standard errors from the
mean. However, this does not have a major effect on our key coefficient, indicating that
outliers are not responsible for our results.
To summarize: the effects of unusual access to loans or liquidity, and public capital
injections are not always robust when we investigate minor perturbations to the basic
econometric methodology. However, both foreign bank nationalisations and privatisations
seem consistently to lower the proportion of British loans in the portfolios of foreign banks.
These effects are usually economically large (around ten percentage points), and statistically
significant. While there have been no British bank privatisations during our sample period,
the British bank nationalisations have had no consistently large effect on the loan mix, from
either an economic or statistical perspective.
3.3 Adding Extra Controls
So far we have shown that our default results seem fairly robust to various model
specifications. However, omitted variable bias remains a serious concern even though we
10

have included both time- and bank-specific fixed effects. Accordingly, we construct a set of
nine other control variables which have been used in microeconometric studies of bank
lending (e.g., Ehrman, Gambacorta, Martinez-Pages, Sevestre and Worms, 2001, and
Kashyap and Stein (2000)). The variables we consider are: a) loan growth; b) asset growth;
c) two variants of the capital adequacy ratio; d) two measures of leverage; and e) a measure
of a banks dependency on the wholesale market (the precise definitions of these variables
are in the data appendix).
We add the nine extra control variables one by one to our default model, and present
the results in Table 4a. It turns out that our key estimates seem to be robust to the inclusion
of the controls we consider. Regardless of which extra control variable we include, the
coefficients suggest that foreign nationalisations have a statistically significant effect on the
domestic share of lending of around ten percentage points, while the effect of British
nationalisations is not statistically significantly different from zero. Including the control
variables also does not substantially change the effects of the other public interventions we
consider.
At the bottom of Table 4a we successively add two sets of dummy variables to the
default specification. The first set isolates the periods after a bank switches its regulatory
status. There are three types of banks in our sample. UK-owned banks have their
headquarters in the UK and are regulated by the FSA. There are also subsidiaries of foreign
banks which operate in the UK and can take deposits; they are therefore subject to FSA
capital requirements. Finally, there are branches of foreign banks which operate in the UK
and can only lend without taking deposits; these are not subject to FSA regulation. Banks
sometimes switch from one category to another, as for instance when Santander Bank
purchased Abbey National in 2004. For each of the (seventeen) banks that switched
regulatory status in the sample, we add a dummy which is one for the bank during the
period after the switch in regulatory regime, and zero otherwise. As can be seen, adding
these controls has little impact on our results.
The final set of controls we add are interactions between a bank’s nationality and
time-specific fixed effects (we note in passing that 51 banks in the sample switched their
11

nationality). These fixed effects allow us to ignore any shocks that are common to the banks
from a particular country at any point in time (e.g., national business cycle or foreign
exchange rate shocks). Adding this (large number of) fixed effects also has little impact on
our key results.
We can add a number of other control variables of interest if we limit our data
sample. In particular, the “PL” form allows us to construct a number of potentially relevant
ratios: a) the ratio of non-performing loans to total assets; b) three variants of the profit rate
(profits as a proportion of assets); and c) the dividend to asset ratio. We add these ratios one
by one, and report the results in Table 4b. Since the PL form has only been available since
2004, the number of observations used for each of the regressions (reported in individual
rows of Table 4b) is 3,742, less than 40% of the sample used to generate the estimates of
Table 4a. However, despite the smaller sample size, our results still seem robust. There is
one exception; when we add the non-performing loan ratio, the size of the foreign
nationalisation effect approximately halves and is only significantly different from zero at
the 7.3% confidence level.
Our results do not change much when we include a number of the extra control
variables simultaneously (instead of one at a time). We divide the extra controls into two
groups, and present the results in Table 5. The first set contains the controls of Table 4a:
loan growth; asset growth; log total assets; capital adequacy; assets/capital (leverage); and
wholesale market dependence. The second set includes the controls included in Table 4b:
the non-performing loan ratio; the dividend ratio; and the profit ratio. Our base-line results
are confirmed when we include all of the controls in the first group. As expected, when
include the second set of controls and the number of observations is reduced accordingly,
our results are weaker.
3.4 Interest Rates
If the banking sector is perfectly competitive, banks are price-takers and the effects
of financial protectionism on a bank’s behaviour might only be observable in the quantity of
lending, but not in interest rates charged on new loans. With imperfect competition on the
12

other hand, standard bank lending models predict that banks can charge interest rates
which are above their cost of capital (Freixas and Rochet, 2008). Since previous work has
rejected the hypothesis of perfect competition in the UK banking system (Claessens and
Laeven, 2004), it seems worthwhile to explore whether we find evidence of financial
protectionism in individual banks’ interest rate decisions. If banks engage in financial
protectionism following nationalisation, we would expect foreign banks to raise interest
rates on British loans following nationalisation and mutatis mutandis. Accordingly, we
repeat our analysis, but substitute interest rates for the loan mix as our dependent variable.
Table 6 is an analogue to Table 3, but uses the effective interest rate on new private
non-financial corporation loans of less than one year maturity as the dependent variable
(instead of the loan mix). We measure interest rates this way since a larger group of banks
lends to the private non-financial corporation sector than to any other sector.
Unfortunately, interest rate data are only available since 2004Q1 for a relatively small
number (less than forty) of the largest banks active in the UK. Still, while the estimates of
Table 6 are based on a small sample of data, they corroborate the results we obtained above
with the ‘loan mix’. In particular, foreign banks seem to demand interest rates on loans to
British companies that are about seventy basis points higher after nationalisation. By way of
contrast, nationalised British banks do not seem to lend at lower rates to UK resident nonfinancial private companies, as the financial protectionism hypothesis would suggest. There
is also weaker evidence that unusual access to loans or liquidity results in financial
protectionism manifest in interest rates.
Of course, it could still be the case that British banks charge higher interest rates
abroad following nationalisation. Unfortunately we do not have the data to test this
proposition. The same is true for nationalised foreign banks’ interest rate behaviour abroad.
It is, on the other hand, reassuring that the difference in the behaviour of foreign and
British nationalised banks is robust to whether we use the ‘loan mix’ or interest rates as the
dependent variable.

13

3.5 A Note on Endogeneity
Are there reasons to believe that our key regressors – massive public interventions
like nationalisations – are simultaneously determined with the bank’s choice of loan mix?
Alternatively, is there any reason to believe that reverse causality is a problem, with a
bank’s loan mix driving public interventions? We think it unlikely; it unclear to us that
bank nationalisations and the like are much affected by the domestic/foreign loan ratio, at
least in our data context. While many British loans did sour during the “Great Recession” of
2008-09, so did many loans abroad; the crisis was a global phenomenon.
Furthermore, bank nationalisations are rare events, and often occur because of
inadequate risk management. In rich countries like the UK, it seems unlikely that the loan
mix is a significant source of such risk. We nevertheless tried a series of instrumental
variables, consisting of the controls used in Tables 4 and 5, but none of them produced
statistically significant results for the coefficients of interest to us.17 This is probably because
the variables we considered are weak instrumental variables, as they are not significantly
correlated with our dummy variables for public interventions (nationalisation, and the like).

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we have provided the first rigorous evidence of financial protectionism.
We take advantage of a uniquely suitable confidential bank-level panel data set collected by
the Bank of England which includes the activities of all banks operating in the UK from
1997Q3 through 2010Q1. Our methodology consists in a plain-vanilla “difference in
difference” panel data regression model, which controls for time- and bank-specific fixed
effects. We find that foreign banks which have been nationalised reduce their proportion of
British to total lending by about eleven percentage points; they also raise loans rates for
British companies by about 70 basis points. But financial protectionism is not universal. In
contrast to their foreign counterparts, there is no evidence that nationalised British banks
changed their lending behaviour in any substantive way.

14

Our main message from this study is that the behaviour of foreign banks operating in
the UK seems to be consistent with financial protectionism. Both the microeconomic causes
of this behaviour and its macroeconomic consequences (if any) remain unknown. We leave
those important issues for future research.

4 For instance, the topic is ignored by e.g., La Porta et al (2002) and Megginson (2005).
5 To the best of our knowledge, there is no theory of relevance in this area.
6
This aggregate evidence is supported by the disaggregated work of Aiyar (2011) who find “Foreign subsidiaries
and branches reduced lending by a larger amount than domestically owned banks”.
7 Even if this were the case, work by Ehrman, Gambacorta, Martinez-Pages, Sevestre and Worms (2001)
shows, in the case of Euro-Area countries, that BankScope data can suggest very different answers than more
complete data available at national central banks.
8
This data set is only available on a locational, as opposed to a consolidated, basis. This difference in reporting
may be important for some questions regarding cross-border lending, but it is irrelevant for ours. Consolidated data
records ‘pure’ cross border lending at the banking group level as an external claim, netting out within-banking
group transfers. In our analysis of the loan mix we are interested in whether domestic claims change with respect to
the sum of domestic and external claims, regardless of composition. The distinction between consolidated and
locational data seems to be therefore irrelevant. Furthermore, the results with the ‘loan mix’ are confirmed by the
effective interest rate data, suggesting that this distinction is probably not affecting our results.
9
To maintain transparency, we do not try to adjust the data for mergers and acquisitions. If one bank is bought by
another, then the former drops out of our sample, while the latter’s lending artificially expands by the acquired
institution. If as a result of nationalization, a foreign bank in Britain needs to sell its domestic operations, its UK
lending would thus shrink artificially. In other words, our methodology would pick up this sale of domestic UK
operations as financial protectionism. However, our data on bank ownership does not suggest that foreign
nationalised banks systematically sold off their operations in the UK.
10 The CC item captures lending to all non- residents. But strictly speaking, a test of the proposed financial
protectionism hypothesis requires data on external lending to a given banks’ country of ownership. A finer
geographical decomposition of this item is available. But claims on the country of ownership miss any lending
that is directed at the home country, but sent via branches and subsidiaries in third countries. The aggregate
CC item includes these third country transfers, which is why it is our preferred measure in this study.
11 The Bank of England uses this data to monitor the transmission of changes in the policy rate through the
British banking sector to the broader economy (see
http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/reporters/defs/def_er.pdf).
12 See http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/mfsd/iadb/notesIADB/effective_int.htm
13 For instance, our classification turns out to be consistent with the database on policy interventions in the
current crisis (including bank nationalisations), provided by Ait-Sahalia, Andritzky, Jobst, Nowak and Tamirisa
(2009).
14
By unusual access to liquidity we refer to the case where banks received larger amounts of liquidity against
assets of lower quality than in normal times. It is important to point out that not all banks chose to access these
facilities during the crisis (in some countries the degree of access was public information; in these countries, the
associated stigma led to a degree of adverse selection among the institutions accessing central banks liquidity
facilities). In other words, unusual liquidity provision was not always universal.
15
For this reason we construct our nationalisation variables with opposite signs for British and foreign banks
after nationalisation.
16
Our Tobit model controls for both the lower (0) and the upper (1) bound of the “loan mix”.
17
Asides from our control variables, we tried an additional instrument on the liabilities side of the balance sheet,
namely the ratio of interbank and financial market to total sight deposits. Banks with a large fraction of this ratio
are dependent on very short-term funding and are likely to have a business model that is probably more vulnerable
to sudden funding stops. But it is not clear why this ratio would determine a banks “loan mix”. We used this
variable as an instrument for foreign nationalisation and found that the coefficient keeps the same sign and is
statistically significant, but that the size increases by a magnitude of 4 to -38.08. Unfortunately data on this variable
is only available since October 2007, but this does suggest that our results are robust to concerns about
endogeneity.
