Testable Implications of Affine Term Structure Models

NBER Working Paper No. 16931
April 2011
JEL No. E43,G12
ABSTRACT
Affine term structure models have been used to address a wide range of questions in macroeconomics
and finance. This paper investigates a number of their testable implications which have not previously
been explored. We show that the assumption that certain specified yields are priced without error
is testable, and find that the implied measurement or specification error exhibits serial correlation in
all of the possible formulations investigated here. We further find that the predictions of these models
for the average levels of different interest rates are inconsistent with the observed data, and propose
a more general specification that is not rejected by the data.

Introduction.

Aﬃne term structure models have become a fundamental tool for empirical research in macroeconomics and finance on the term structure of interest rates. The appeal of the framework
comes from the closed-form solutions it provides for bond and bond option prices under the
assumption that there are no possibilities for risk-free arbitrage (Duﬃe, Pan and Singleton,
2000).

ATSM have been used for purposes such as measuring risk premia (Duﬀee, 2002;

Cochrane and Piazzesi, 2009), studying the eﬀect of macroeconomic developments on the
term structure (Ang and Piazzesi, 2003; Beechey and Wright, 2009; Bauer, 2009), the role
of monetary policy (Rudebusch and Wu, 2008), explaining the bond-yield “conundrum” of
2004-2005 (Rudebusch, Swanson and Wu, 2006), inferring market expectations of inflation
(Christensen, Lopez and Rudebusch, 2010), and evaluating the eﬀects of the extraordinary
central bank interventions during the financial crisis (Christensen, Lopez and Rudebusch,
2009; Smith, 2010; Hamilton and Wu, 2010a). Gürkaynak and Wright (2010) and Rudebusch
(2010) provide useful surveys of this literature.
Clive Granger’s primary interest was not in a model’s theoretical elegance, but instead
in its practical relevance. He would always want to know whether the framework generates
useful forecasts, and whether the properties of those forecasts could be used to test some of the
model’s implicit assumptions. To be sure, forecasting interest rates has been one important
goal for many users of ATSM. Improved forecasts are cited by Ang and Piazzesi (2003)
as an important reason for including observed macroeconomic factors in the model, and by
Christensen, Diebold and Rudebusch (forthcoming) as an advantage of their dynamic Nelson-

Siegel specification.1

And comparing the fit of a broad class of diﬀerent models has been

attempted by Dai and Singleton (2000), Hong and Li (2005) and Pericoli and Taboga (2008).
However, as implemented by these researchers, making these comparisons is an arduous process
requiring numerical estimation of highly nonlinear models on ill-behaved likelihood surfaces.
As a result, previous researchers have overlooked some of the basic empirical implications of
these models that are quite easy to test empirically.
In a companion paper (Hamilton and Wu, 2010b), we note that an important subset of
ATSM imply a restricted vector autoregression in observable variables.

These restrictions

take two forms: (1) nonlinear restrictions on the VAR coeﬃcients implied by the model, and
(2) blocks of zero coeﬃcients. In this paper we test the first class of restrictions using the
χ2 test developed by Hamilton and Wu (2010b), and note that the second class of restrictions
often take the form of simple and easily testable Granger-causality restrictions, and indeed
provide an excellent illustration of Granger’s (1969) proposal that testing such forecasting
implications can often be a very useful tool for evaluating a model.
We apply these tests to the data and find that the assumptions that are routinely invoked
in these models can in fact be routinely rejected. We show that the assumption that certain
specified yields are priced without error is testable, and find that the implied measurement
or specification error exhibits serial correlation in all of the possible formulations investigated
here.2 We further demonstrate that the predictions of these models for the average levels of
diﬀerent interest rates are inconsistent with the observed data. We find that a specification

On the other hand, Duﬀee (2011) found that the ATSM cross-section restrictions don’t and shouldn’t help
with forecasting.
2
Duﬀee (2011) has also noted the substantial serial correlation of measurement errors.

in which (1) the term structure factors are measured by the first three principal components
of the set of observed yields , (2) predictions for average levels of interest rates are relaxed,
and (3) measurement error is serially correlated, can be reconciled with the observed time
series behavior of interest rates. We illustrate how Granger-causality tests can also be used
to determine the specification of complicated macro-finance term structure models.

Such

tests suggest that a strong premium should be placed on parsimony.

Aﬃne term structure models.

Let Pnt denote the price at time t of a pure-discount bond that is certain to be worth $1
at time t + n. A broad class of finance models posit that Pnt = Et (Mt+1 Pn−1,t+1 ) for some
pricing kernel Mt+1 . Aﬃne term structure models suppose that the price Pnt depends on a
possibly unobserved (m × 1) vector of factors Ft that follows a Gaussian first-order vector
autoregression,
Ft+1 = c + ρFt + Σut+1
with ut an i.i.d. sequence of N (0, Im ) vectors.

(1)

The second component of ATSM is the

¡
¢
assumption that the pricing kernel is characterized by Mt+1 = exp −rt − 12 λ0t λt − λ0t ut+1 for

rt the risk-free one-period interest rate and λt an (m × 1) vector that characterizes investors’

attitudes toward risk; λt = 0 would correspond to risk neutrality. Both this risk-pricing vector
and the risk-free rate are postulated to be aﬃne functions of the vector of factors: λt = λ+ΛFt
and rt = δ0 + δ 01 Ft . The risk-free rate rt is simply the negative of the log of the price of a

4

one-period bond,
rt = log(P0t /P1t ) = log(1) − log(P1t ) = −p1t ,
for pnt = log(Pnt ). After a little algebra (e.g., Ang and Piazzesi, 2003), the above equations
imply that
0

pnt = an + bn Ft
where the values of bn and an can be calculated recursively from

0

0

bn = bn−1 ρQ − δ 01

(2)

ρQ = ρ − ΣΛ

an = an−1 + bn−1 cQ + (1/2)bn−1 ΣΣ0 bn−1 − δ 0

(4)

cQ = c − Σλ

starting from b1 = −δ 1 and a1 = −δ 0 . The implied yield on an n-period bond, ynt = −n−1 pnt ,
is then characterized by
ynt = an + b0n Ft

(6)

bn = −n−1 bn

(7)

an = −n−1 an .

(8)

Suppose we observe a set of N diﬀerent yields, Yt = (yn1 ,t , yn2 ,t , ..., ynN ,t )0 , and collect (6)

5

into a vector system
Yt = A + BFt

(9)

for A an (N × 1) vector whose ith element is ani and B an (N × m) matrix whose ith row is
b0ni . If m < N and Σ has rank m, then the model (9) is instantly refuted, because it implies
that a regression of any one of the yields on m others should have an R2 of unity. Although
such an R2 is not actually unity, it can be quite high, and this observation motivates the claim
that a small number m of factors might be used to give an excellent prediction of any bond
yield. One common approach is to suppose that there are m linear combinations of Yt for
which (6) holds exactly,
Y1t = A1 + B1 Ft

(10)

where the (m × 1) vector Y1t is given by Y1t = H1 Yt for H1 an (m × N ) matrix, A1 = H1 A, and
B1 = H1 B. The matrix H1 might simply select a subset of m particular yields (e.g., Chen and
Scott, 1993; Ang and Piazzesi, 2003), or alternatively could be interpreted as the matrix that
defines the first m principal components of Yt (e.g., Joslin, Singleton and Zhu, forthcoming).
The remaining Ne = N − m yields are assumed to be priced with error,

Y2t = A2 + B2 Ft + u2t

(11)

for u2t an (Ne × 1) vector of measurement or specification errors, Y2t = H2 Yt , A2 = H2 A,
and B2 = H2 B for H2 (Ne × N ). The measurement errors have invariably been regarded as
serially and mutually independent, u2t ∼ i.i.d. N (0, ΣeΣ0e ) for Σe a diagonal matrix, and with

6

the sequence {u2t } assumed to be independent of the factor innovations {ut } in (1).

3

Testable implications when only yield data are used.

In this section we consider the popular class of models in which the entire vector of factors Ft
is treated as observed only through the yields themselves. We first describe the implications
for the underlying VAR in Yt , and then investigate tests of the various restrictions.

3.1

VAR representation.

As in Hamilton and Wu (2010b), we premultiply (1) by B1 ,

B1 Ft+1 = B1 c + B1 ρB1−1 B1 Ft + B1 Σut+1 .

Adding A1 to both sides and using (10),

Y1,t+1 = A∗1 + φ∗11 Y1t + u1,t+1

(12)

A∗1 = A1 + B1 c − B1 ρB1−1 A1

(13)

φ∗11 = B1 ρB1−1

(14)

u1,t+1 = B1 Σut+1 .

(15)

7

Similar operations on (11) produce

Y2t = A∗2 + φ∗21 Y1t + u2t

(16)

A∗2 = A2 − B2 B1−1 A1

(17)

φ∗21 = B2 B1−1 ,

(18)

for u2t the identical error as in (11).
Under the assumptions made above for ut and u2t , the error u1,t+1 in (12) is uncorrelated
with {Yt , Yt−1 , ...}, and u2t in (16) is uncorrelated with {Yt−1 , Yt−2 , ...}. Hence although the
nonlinear recursions that define the ATSM are quite complicated, the fundamental structure
is very simple— the ATSM is simply a vector autoregression for (Y1t0 , Y2t0 )0 that is subject to a
variety of restrictions. A number of these restrictions are quite simple to test without using
the core equations (2) and (4), as we now discuss.

3.2

Granger-causality tests: Y1.

Equations (12) and (16) are a special case of a VAR(1), whose first block in the absence of
restrictions would take the form

Y1t = A∗1 + φ∗11 Y1,t−1 + φ∗12 Y2,t−1 + u1t .

(19)

In other words, the ATSM implies that the yields priced with error Y2 should not Grangercause the yields priced without error Y1 . Since the coeﬃcients of this unrestricted VAR can
8

be estimated by OLS equation by equation, this is an extremely straightforward hypothesis
to test.
We test this implication using end-of-month constant-maturity Treasury yields taken from
the daily FRED database of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, using maturities of 3
months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years and 10 years. All the in-sample
estimation was based on the subsample from 1983:M1 to 2002:M7, with the subsequent 60
months (2002:M8 to 2007:M7) reserved for out-of-sample exercises.3
For our baseline example, we use m = 3 factors and suppose that 3 yields— namely the
6-month, 2-year, and 10-year yields— are priced without error (Y1t = (y6t , y24t , y120t )0 ), while
the other yields are priced with error (Y2t = (y3t , y12t , y36t , y60t , y84t )0 ). The first row of Table 1
reports tests for Granger-causality from Y2 to Y1 for this specification. An F -test of the null
hypothesis that the first row of φ∗12 is zero (in other words, that Y2,t−1 does not help predict
the 6-month yield) leads to strong rejection with a p-value of 0.006. Analogous tests that the
second and third rows of φ∗12 are zero (Y2,t−1 does not predict y24,t or y120,t ) fail to reject with
p-values of 0.198 and 0.204. A likelihood ratio test with Sims’ small-sample correction4 of the
null hypothesis that all 15 elements of φ∗12 are zero leads to very clear rejection (last column
of row 1).
This test makes apparent that the specification of which yields are assumed to be priced
3

We have also repeated many of these calculations reported below using the alternative measures of interest
rates developed by Gürkaynak et al. (2007) and came up with broadly similar results.

likelihood ratio tests reported in this paper use this small-sample correction, with the exception of Table 9, in
which there are diﬀering degrees of freedom across equations.

without error is not an arbitrary normalization, but instead is a testable restriction. If Y2t is
priced with error, it should contain no information about the factors beyond that contained
in Y1t , and therefore should not help to predict Y1,t+1 . If some maturities are more helpful
than others for forecasting, those are the ones we’d want to include in Y1t for the ATSM to
be consistent with the data. In the subsequent rows of Table 1 we report analogous F -tests
and likelihood ratio tests for each of the

¡8¢
3

= 56 possible choices we could have made for

the 3 yields to include in Y1t . It turns out that every single possible specification of Y1t is
inconsistent with the data according to the likelihood ratio test.
Granger (1980) expressed the view that one wants with these tests to consider true predictive power, which may be diﬀerent from the ability to fit a given observed sample of data.
For this reason, Granger stressed the importance of out-of-sample evaluation. In this spirit,
we estimated (19) for t = 1, 2, .., T and used the resulting coeﬃcients and values of Y1T and
Y2T to predict the value of Y1,T +1 , whose ith element we denote ŷi,T +1 and associated forecast
error ε̂i,T +1 . We also estimated the restricted regressions with φ∗12 = 0 to calculate a restricted

forecast ŷi,T
+1 and error ε̂i,T +1 . We then increased the sample size by one to generate ŷi,T +2

and ŷi,T

for i corresponding to the first, second, or third element of Y1t for each of the 56 possible choices
of Y1t . For example, inclusion of Y2,t−1 leads to a 25% out-of-sample improvement in forecasting

10

the 6-month yield and an 8% improvement for the 2-year yield for Y1t = (y6t , y24t , y120t )0 .
Clark and West (2007) discussed the statistical significance of such post-sample comparisons, noting that even if the null hypothesis is false (that is, even if Y2,t−1 actually is helpful in
predicting Y1t ) we might expect the above statistic to be negative as a result of sampling uncertainty. They proposed a test statistic that corrects for this which, while not asymptotically

whether the Clark-West statistic leads to rejection based on the N (0, 1) approximation to a

one-sided test.5 For 51 out of the 56 possible specifications of Y1t , the out-of-sample evidence
that Y2,t−1 helps forecast Y1t is statistically significant at the 5% level for at least one of the
elements of Y1t .6
One might think that perhaps the issue is that there may be more than 3 factors in Y1t . We
repeated the in-sample tests of whether Y2 Granger-causes Y1 for each of the

¡8¢
4

= 70 possible

ways that a 4-dimensional vector Y1t could be chosen from Yt . For 66 of these possibilities, the
likelihood ratio test leads to rejection, and the 4 that are not rejected by this test turn out to
be inconsistent with the Y2 Granger-causality tests reported in the next subsection. If we let
Y1t be a 5-dimensional vector, 52 of the 56 possibilities are rejected, and again the 4 that are

That is, * indicates a value of C above 1.645 and ** a value above 2.33.
One might note that the biggest out-of-sample improvements come from yields of 1-year maturity or less.
We attribute this to the fact that over the post-sample evaluation period (2002:M8 to 2007:M7), short rates
exhibited a dramatic swing down and back up while long rates remained fairly flat— there is simply more for
the regression to forecast with short rates than long rates on this subsample.

not rejected here will be rejected by the tests below. Twenty-three of the 28 possible choices
for a 6-dimensional factor vector are rejected. And even if we say that 7 of the 8 yields in
Yt are themselves term-structure factors, for 5 of the 8 possible choices, we find that the one
omitted yield Granger-causes the remaining 7.
Even if no single choice for the yields to include in Y1t is consistent with the data, is there
some other linear combination of Yt that satisfies the Granger-causality restriction?

One

popular choice is to use the first 3 principal components of Yt as the value for Y1t , that is,
use Y1t = (z1t , z2t , z3t )0 for zit = h0i Yt and hi the eigenvector associated with the ith largest
eigenvalue of
T −1

T
X

Ỹt Ỹt0

(20)

t=1

where elements of Ỹt are obtained by subtracting the mean of the corresponding elements of
Yt . The first row of Table 3 reports p-values for tests that the first 3 principal components can
be predicted from the last 5, both individually (first 3 columns) and as a group (last column).
For example, we just fail to reject (p = 0.061) that α4 = α5 = · · · = α8 = 0 in the regression

z1t = α0 +

8
X

αj zj,t−1 + ε1t ,

j=1

(row 1, column 1) and likewise just fail to reject the joint hypothesis that {z1t , z2t , z3t } cannot
be predicted on the basis of {zj,t−1 }8j=4 (row 1, last column). Notwithstanding, these tests
are quite close to rejection, and one might wonder whether 3 principal components may not
be enough to capture the dynamics.

But an interesting thing happens when we let Y1t be

a (4 × 1) vector corresponding to the first 4 principal components.
12

As seen in the second

row of Table 3, the evidence for statistical predictability is stronger when we use 4 principal
components rather than 3.

Indeed, we’d also reject a specification using 5, 6, or even 7

principal components.
Table 4 investigates the predictability of principal components out of sample7 . While the
contribution of {z4,t−1 , ..., z8,t−1 } is not quite statistically significantly helpful for forecasting
z1t within sample (first row and column of Table 3), it is statistically significantly helpful out
of sample (first row and column of Table 4). Indeed, for all but one choice of the number of
principal components to use in constructing Y1t , there is at least one element of Y1t that can
be forecast statistically significantly out of sample on the basis of Y2,t−1 .
Why does the consistency with the data become even worse when we add more principal components?

The assumption behind the ATSM was that, if we use enough principal

components, we can capture the true factors, and whatever is left over is measurement or
specification error, which was simply assumed to be white noise. But the feature in the data
is that, even though the higher principal components are tiny, they are in fact still serially
correlated. One can see this directly by looking at the vector autoregression for the elements
of Y2t alone,
Y2t = c2 + φ22 Y2,t−1 + ε2t .
Suppose we let Y2t = (zm+1,t , zm+2,t , ..., zNt )0 be the smallest principal components and test
whether φ22 = 0, that is, test the null hypothesis that Y2t is serially uncorrelated.

This

hypothesis turns out to be rejected at the 1% level for each choice of m = 3, 4, 5, 6, or
7

Note that we keep hi the same for each r, that is, hi is based on (20) for the original sample through T,
so that for each T + r we are talking about forecasting the same variable.

13

7.

Moreover, cross-correlations between these smaller principal components are statisti-

cally significant, which explains why even though it may be hard to forecast {z1t , z2t , z3t }
using {z4,t−1 , z5,t−1 , z6,t−1 , z7,t−1 , z8,t−1 }, it is in fact easier to forecast {z1t , z2t , z3t , z4t } using
{z5,t−1 , z6,t−1 , z7,t−1 , z8,t−1 }.

3.3

Granger-causality tests: Y2.

We turn next to testable implications of (16), which embodies two sets of constraints. The
first is that the m linear combinations of Yt represented by Y1t are suﬃcient to capture all
the contemporaneous correlations.
(n)

dimensional vector Y2t and Y2t

Specifically, if ynt is any element of the Ne = (N − m)

denotes the remaining Ne − 1 elements of Y2t , then in the

regression
(n)

ynt = c0 + c01 Y1t + c02 Y2t + unt ,

(21)

we should find c2 = 0. The first row of Table 5 reports in-sample p-values associated with the
test of this null hypothesis when Y1t is specified as the 6-month, 2-year, and 10-year yields. For
ynt the 3-month yield, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (p = 0.139) that c2 = 0. However,
for each of the 4 other yields in Y2t (namely, the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year, and 7 year), the null
hypothesis is rejected at the 0.1% significance level, as reported in the remaining entries of the
first row of Table 5. Subsequent rows of Table 5 report the analogous tests for every possible
selection of 3 yields to include in Y1t . For every single choice, at least 4 of the resulting 5
elements in Y2t are predictable, at a significance level less than 1%, by some of the other yields
in Y2t for both in-sample tests (Table 5) and out of sample (Table 6).
Nor can this problem obviously be solved by making Y1t a higher-dimensional vector. For
14

the

¡8¢
4

= 70 possible 4-dimensional vectors for Y1t , in every single case at least one of the

elements of Y2t is predictable at the 0.1% significance level by the other 3. For the

¡8¢
5

= 56

possible 5-dimensional vectors, all but 8 have at least one ynt for which the null hypothesis of
no prediction is rejected at the 1% level. If we go to m = 6, of the 28 possible specifications
of the 2-dimensional vector Y2t , for 15 of them we find evidence at the 5% level that one is
predicted by the other.
Note that when Y1t and Y2t consist of selected principal components, the elements are
orthogonal by construction so that the specification would necessarily pass the above test.
A separate implication of (16) is that, if we condition on the contemporaneous value of
Y1t , lagged values of Yt−1 should be of no help in predicting the value of any element of Y2t .
That is, in the regression
0

ynt = c0 + c01 Y1t + c2 Yt−1 + unt ,
we should find that the 8 elements of c2 are all zero if ynt is any element of Y2t . For each of
the 56 possible choices for the 3-dimensional vector Y1t , this hypothesis ends up being rejected
at the 1% level for each of the implied 5 elements of Y2t on the basis of both the in-sample F
test and the out-of-sample Clark-West test.
Using a higher-dimensional Y1t or principal components does not solve this problem. For
example, let zjt denote the jth principal component and consider the regression

zjt = c0 +

m
X

c1i zit + c02 Yt−1 + ujt

i=1

for some j > m. The first row of Table 7 shows that, for m = 3, we strongly reject the

15

hypothesis that c2 = 0 for each j = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Subsequent rows show that the same is true
for any choice of m. Table 8 confirms that the statistical contribution of Yt−1 to a forecast of
any of the smaller principal components is statistically significant out of sample as well.
Our conclusion from this and the preceding subsection is that the assumption that there
exists a readily observed factor of any dimension that captures all the predictability of Yt
is not consistent with the behavior of these data.

At a minimum, a data-coherent specifi-

cation requires the assumption that the measurement or specification error must be serially
correlated.

3.4

Tests of predicted values for nonzero coeﬃcients.

Up to this point we have been testing the large blocks of zero restrictions imposed by equations
(12) and (16) relative to an unrestricted VAR. We now consider the particular values predicted
by an ATSM for the nonzero elements in these two equations.

Duﬀee (2011) used mean-

squared-error comparisons to conclude that these nonlinear restrictions are typically rejected
statistically. Here we use the minimum-chi-square approach to test overidentifying restrictions
developed by Hamilton and Wu (2010b). First we will develop some new extensions of those
methods appropriate for the case in which the factors Ft are treated as directly observed in
the sense that the value of B1 in (10) is known a priori; the alternative case of latent factors
(that is, when B1 must be estimated) is discussed in Hamilton and Wu (2010b). Note that
the tests described in Sections 3.2-3.3 are perfectly valid regardless of whether the factors are
treated as latent or observed.
The values of φ∗11 in (12) and φ∗21 in (16) are completely determined by the matrix ρ and the

sequence {bn }, where the latter in turn can be calculated as functions of ρQ and δ 1 using (2) and
(7) . The resulting value for B1 , along with the structural parameters Σ and Σe, determine the
variance-covariance matrix of the innovations in (12) and (16). The sequence {bn } and values
of Σ, cQ , δ 0 , c and ρ can be used to calculate the constants A∗1 and A∗2 in (12) and (16). Thus
the likelihood function is fully specified by the structural parameters {c, ρ, cQ , ρQ , δ1 , Σ, Σe , δ 0 }.
As discussed in Hamilton and Wu (2010b), some further normalization is necessary in order
to be able to identify these structural parameters on the basis of observation of {Yt }Tt=1 .
If we assume that m linear combinations of Yt are observed without error, Joslin, Singleton
and Zhu (forthcoming) suggest that a natural normalization is to take the (m × 1) vector Ft
to be given by these particular linear combinations, Ft = H1 Yt , for H1 a known (m × N)
matrix. For our base case specification in which Yt = (y3t , y6t , y12,t y24,t , y36,t , y60,t , y84,t , y120,t )0
and Y1t = (y6t , y24,t , y120,t )0 we would have

Premultiplying (9) by H1 , and substituting the condition Ft = H1 Yt gives

H1 Yt = H1 A + H1 BH1 Yt ,

requiring H1 A = 0 and H1 B = Im . These conditions turn out to imply a normalization similar
to that of Joslin, Singleton and Zhu (forthcoming) in which the (m × m) matrix ρQ is known

and Σ, as the following proposition demonstrates.
Proposition 1. Let ξ = (ξ 1 , ..., ξ m )0 denote a proposed vector of ordered eigenvalues of
ρQ . Let ι denote an (m × 1) vector of ones and H1 a known (m × N ) matrix. Define

Suppose we assume that the factors are directly observable in the form of some known
linear combination Y1t = H1 Yt , and define those linear combinations observed with error to be
Y2t = H2 Yt for H2 a known (Ne ×N ) matrix with Ne = N −m. Then Proposition 1 establishes
that the likelihood function of {Yt }Tt=1 can be parameterized in terms of {c, ρ, ξ, Σ, Σe , δ 0 }.
While the conventional approach to parameter estimation would be to choose these parameters
so as to maximize the likelihood function directly, Hamilton and Wu (2010b) argue that
there are substantial benefits from estimating by the minimum-chi-square procedure originally
developed by Rothenberg (1973).

The procedure is asymptotically equivalent to MLE but

19

often substantially easier to implement. The approach is to first estimate the reduced-form
parameters in (12) and (16) directly by ordinary least squares:

The minimum-chi-square approach is to let these simple closed-form OLS formulas do
the job of maximizing the unrestricted likelihood for {Y1 , ..., YT |Y0 }, and then find estimates
of the structural parameters {c, ρ, ξ, Σ, Σe , δ 0 } whose predicted values for these reduced-form
coeﬃcients are as close as possible to the OLS estimates.

Closeness is defined in terms of

minimizing a quadratic form with weighting matrix given by a consistent estimate of the
information matrix:

satisfying Dm vech (Ω) = vec(Ω).
Note that since the information matrix is block diagonal with respect to the elements of
Ω∗2 , and since Ω∗2 are the only reduced-form parameters aﬀected by the measurement error
parameters Σe , MCSE for the latter can be obtained directly from the OLS estimates Ω̂∗2 ,
namely Σ̂eΣ̂0e = Ω̂∗2 , and this does not aﬀect estimates of any other structural parameters.
Moreover, this result still holds even when restrictions are imposed on Σe. For example,
for the usual specification in which the measurement error is taken to be contemporaneously
uncorrelated, the MCSE is obtained by setting diagonal elements of Σ̂e equal to the square
roots of the corresponding diagonal elements of Ω̂∗2 , with oﬀ-diagonal elements of Σ̂e set to
zero, and again with no consequences for other parameter estimates.
Similarly, no matter what values might be chosen for the other parameters, as long as B1
is invertible, from equation (13) we can always choose ĉ so as to match Â∗1 exactly, and from

21

∗

(14) we can choose ρ̂ so as to match φ̂11 exactly, so that the first block of π̂ contributes zero
to the objective function (24).8 Thus the numerical component of MCS estimation amounts
to choosing {ξ, Σ, δ 0 } so as to minimize

In addition to being asymptotically equivalent to and often easier to compute than the
MLE, minimum-chi-square estimation has the further benefit that the optimized value for the
objective function (26) has an asymptotic χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom given by
the number of overidentifying restrictions. Hence an immediate by-product of the estimation
is an evaluation of the validity of the kinds of restrictions considered in this section. There
are m(m + 1)/2 elements in Ω̂∗1 and (N − m)(m + 1) elements in Π̂∗2 , or 26 parameters in the
unrestricted reduced form for the case when m = 3 and N = 8. On the other hand, there are
m elements in ξ, m(m + 1)/2 elements in Σ, and 1 element in δ 0 , or 10 structural parameters
for the above example. The model then imposes 16 overidentifying restrictions, or particular
ways in which the parameters in regressions of the elements of Y2t on a constant and Y1t should
be related to each other and related to the residual variance-covariance matrix for a VAR(1)
for Y1t itself.
8

Joslin, Singleton and Zhu (forthcoming) derived a similar result for maximum likelihood estimation.

22

We first apply this procedure to our base-case specification in which m = 3 and Y1t is taken
to be the 6-month, 2-year, and 10-year yields. The resulting χ2 (16) statistic is 633.58, leading
to overwhelming rejection of the null hypothesis that the ATSM restrictions are consistent
with the data. The procedure also provides an immediate check on which elements of π̂ 2 are
most at odds with the predictions implied by g2 (θ̂ 2 ). The biggest positive contributions to
(26) come from the constant terms Â∗2 .
This claim might be surprising to many researchers, since it is often asserted that a standard
ATSM does a good job of capturing the cross-section distribution of returns, precisely the
claim being tested by the above χ2 test.

The usual basis for the claim is the observation

that 3 linear combinations of yields can account for an overwhelming fraction of the variances
and covariances of yields. However, the high R2 from such regressions only summarize the
comovements between the variables as distinct from their individual average levels.

The

ATSM also has testable implications for the latter, which we have just seen are inconsistent
with the values observed in the data.
We can consider relaxing this feature of the ATSM by adding to each an an unrestricted
constant kn . This causes the parameter δ 0 to be no longer identified, in eﬀect replacing
the original single parameter δ 0 for purposes of describing the average values of the diﬀerent yields with N − m new constants.

The minimum value for (26) achieved by choice of

{ξ, Σ, km+1 , ..., kN } turns out to be 132.75. Although this is a substantial improvement over
the original specification, it is still grossly inconsistent with a χ2 (12) distribution.
Although the MCS χ2 statistic is not directly testing the separate zero restrictions that we
investigated earlier, some of those restrictions are maintained auxiliary assumptions that can

23

influence the outcome of the χ2 test. In particular, we saw above that there is very strong
evidence that the error term in the Y2t regression is serially correlated. We now investigate
MCS estimation of an ATSM when this restriction is relaxed.
Suppose that (16) holds, with φ∗21 given by the structural parameters B2 B1−1 but A∗2 unrestricted and the error term correlated with lagged yields:

u2t = ψ2 Yt−1 + ε2t .

(27)

Substituting (27) into (16) results in

Y2t = A†2 + B2 B1−1 Y1t + ψ 2 Yt−1 + ε2t

for which the corresponding unrestricted reduced form is

Y2t = A†2 + ψ †1 Y1t + ψ †2 Yt−1 + ε2t

whose unrestricted estimates are again easily obtained by OLS. We then choose {ξ, Σ, A†2 , ψ †2 }
so as to minimize9

For this case, there are m(m+1)/2+Ne (1+m+N) = 66 unrestricted reduced-form parameters
and m+m(m+1)/2+Ne (N +1) = 54 structural parameters for 12 overidentifying restrictions.
The χ2 (12) statistic turns out to be 78.52, which still leads to strong rejection.
One could relax additional restrictions to try to arrive at a specification that is not rejected.
However, even if a specification were found that is consistent with the observed value for Π2 ,
the model would still have to contend with rejection of the many separate zero restrictions
documented above. Based on those earlier tests, the most promising specification was when
Y1t corresponds to the first 3 principal components, that is, Y1t = H1 Yt for rows of H1 corresponding to the first three eigenvectors of (20), and Y2t the remaining 5 principal components.
When we calculate the MCS statistic (26) for the original specification, we arrive at a χ2 (16)
statistic of 650.47. Relaxing the constraint on the intercepts by introducing the km+1 , ..., kN
parameters brings this down to χ2 (12) = 145.05. Allowing for serial correlation in u2t yields
a χ2 (12) statistic of 13.48 (p = 0.335), fully consistent with the data.
We conclude that representing the term structure factors by the first 3 principal compo25

nents oﬀers more promise of fitting the data than using any subset of m yields. However, it
is necessary to acknowledge that the measurement or specification error is serially correlated.
One furthermore needs to relax the predictions of the ATSM for the average levels of the
various yields in order to describe accurately what is found in the data.

ATSM with observable macroeconomic factors.

Up to this point we have been discussing models in which the only data being used are the
yields themselves. There is a substantial literature beginning with Ang and Piazzesi (2003)
that also incorporates directly observable macroeconomic variables such as output growth and
inflation, collected in a vector fto . In our empirical investigation of these models, we will take
fto to be a (2 × 1) vector whose first element is the monthly Chicago Fed National Activity
Index and second element is the percentage change from the previous year in the implicit
price deflator for personal consumption expenditures from the FRED database of the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
These observable macro factors fto are then thought to supplement an (m × 1) vector of
conventional yield factors ft in jointly determining the behavior of bond yields. The standard
assumption is that the P -measure dynamics of the factors could be described with a VAR:10
10
The fact that only a single lag on ft is used is without loss of generality. If ft is a latent vector, one could
always stack a higher-order system for these latent variables into companion form, as we do below with the
observed macro factors. However, if one wanted to take this interpretation of the dimension of ft literally,
one would want to impose corresponding additional restrictions on ρ.

Elements of the (m + 2k) × 1 vectors λ and δ 1 and of the (m + 2k) × (m + 2k) matrix Λ
27

corresponding to zero blocks of Σ are set to zero.

We can then calculate predicted yields

using (2) through (6) as before.
Among the choices to be made are the dimension of the latent vector (m), number of lags
to summarize macro dynamics (k), and whether the macro factors and latent factors can be
regarded as independent (as represented by the restrictions ρo = 0, ρ 1 = · · · = ρ k = 0,
and Σ o = 0). Pericoli and Taboga (2008) conducted comprehensive investigations of this
question through the arduous process of estimating assorted specifications subject to the full
set of nonlinear restrictions imposed by the theory. Once again, however, it is possible to use
Granger’s suggestion of choosing among the possible specifications on the basis of extremely
simple tests of the underlying forecasting relations, as we now illustrate.
Suppose as in (10) that there is an (m × 1) vector of yields Y1t for which the predicted
pricing relations hold exactly, and as in (11) that there is an (Ne × 1) vector Y2t priced with
error. Then similar algebra to that used earlier produces the reduced form implied by the
system:

= A∗2 + φ∗2o Fto + φ∗21 Y1t + u∗2t .
(Ne ×2k)

(31)

(2×m)

(33)

(Ne ×m)

If the macro and finance factors are independent, then the coeﬃcient φ∗o1 in (31) must be zero.
Thus an immediate testable implication of independence of the macro and latent factors is
whether the yields in Y1t Granger-cause the observed macro factors. Furthermore, the choice

28

o
of k ends up determining the number of lags of ft−j
that are helpful for forecasting fto , Y1t ,

and Y2t (dimensions of φ∗oo , φ∗1o , and φ∗2o in (31) through (33)). All of these can be tested by
simple OLS without having to estimate the ATSM at all.
To illustrate this possibility, we focus on the choice in lag length between k = 1 or k = 12
and on whether one wants to model the latent factors and macro factors as independent.
We further specify that m = 3 and that the 6-month, 2-year, and 10-year securities are
priced without error.

Row 2 of Table 9 indicates that we would reject the null hypothesis

of independence under the maintained assumption of 12 lags, while row 3 indicates we would
reject the null hypothesis that only 1 lag is needed under the maintained assumption of
dependence.
Despite the superior in-sample fit, the least restrictive specification in row 1 of Table 9
is richly parameterized, with 28 to 30 regression coeﬃcients estimated per equation. While
the model selection criterion11 suggested by Akaike reaches the same conclusion as the insample F test, the Schwarz criterion favors the most parsimonious specification with k =
1 and independence of the macro and latent factors.

Table 10 reinforces this conclusion

from Schwarz, finding that the out-of-sample, one-month-ahead forecast of yields generated
by the k = 1 specifications always beat k = 12. On the other hand, a specification that
allows dependence between the macro and latent factors usually dominates the independent
specification in terms of out-of-sample performance. These results suggest that a parsimonious
1-lag specification that still allows for interaction between the factors might be preferred.

Conclusion.

A number of previous researchers have discussed related shortcomings of ATSM. Cochrane
and Piazzesi (2009) documented that the linear combinations that describe the contemporaneous correlations among yields are diﬀerent from those that are most helpful for forecasting.
Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2002) found that lagged volatilities as well as lagged levels of
yields contribute to forecasts, while Ludvigson and Ng (forthcoming), Cooper and Priestly
(2009), and Joslin, Priebsch and Singleton (2010) concluded that macro variables have useful forecasting information beyond that contained in current yields.

Duﬀee (forthcoming)

suggested that these results could be explained by near-cancellation of the forecasting and
risk-pricing implications of certain factors, causing these factors to be hidden from any collection of contemporaneous yields and yet still useful for forecasting future yields.
However, the results in our paper go beyond any of these claims. We find that for Y1t a
collection of m yields or principal components and Y2t the remaining yields or components,
the data consistently reject the hypothesis that Y2 does not Granger-cause Y1 , regardless of
how large one makes m, and further reject the hypothesis that the residuals from a regression
of Y2t on Y1t are serially uncorrelated.

These results could not be attributed to hidden or

omitted factors in the sense of Duﬀee (forthcoming) or Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2002),
since our explanatory variables are direct functions of the yields themselves. Instead we find
that the data speak conclusively that the specification or measurement error in the system
must have its own important dynamic structure.
As noted by Duﬀee (2011, forthcoming), the specification error could be broadly attributed
to factors such as bid/ask spreads, preferred habitats of particular investors, interpolation
30

errors, and liquidity premia. None of these factors would a priori be expected to be white
noise, and it should not be surprising that we find the measurement error terms in these models
to be quite predictable. Furthermore, it is not a defense to argue that this serial correlation
can be ignored because the errors themselves are small— this form of model misspecification
makes conventional standard errors unreliable and invalidates standard hypothesis tests about
any parameters of the system.
In this paper we suggested one approach to dealing with these problems, which is to
postulate as a primitive that the specification errors have their own mean and serial dependence
structure, and estimate these separately from the parameters of the core ATSM. We illustrated
estimation of a system of this form that seems to be consistent with the data.

A more

satisfactory approach would be to try to understand the features of these specification errors
in a more structural way, for example, trying to model liquidity eﬀects directly. This seems a
particularly important task if one’s goal is to understand the behavior of the term structure
during the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, for which Gürkaynak and Wright (2010) showed
that even the most basic arbitrage relations appeared to break down.
Apart from these issues, our paper illustrates that many of the key underlying assumptions
of ATSM are trivially easy to test. Clive Granger’s perennial question of whether the model’s
specification is consistent with basic forecasting relations in the data seems a particularly
helpful guide for research using ATSM.
