ABSTRACT
We integrate the housing market and the labor market in a dynamic general equilibrium model with
credit and search frictions. The model is confronted with the U.S. macroeconomic time series. Our
estimated model can account for two prominent facts observed in the data. First, the land price and
the unemployment rate tend to move in opposite directions over the business cycle. Second, a shock
that moves the land price is capable of generating large volatility in unemployment. Our estimation
indicates that a 10 percent drop in the land price leads to a 0.34 percentage point increase of the unemployment
rate (relative to its steady state).

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

1

I. Introduction
A striking feature of business cycles is that land prices and unemployment comove (Figure 1). Never is this feature more true than in the recent recession, when the collapse in the
housing market was followed by sharply rising unemployment. The comovements between
land prices and unemployment, along with other key business cycle variables, are quantified
by a Bayesian vector autoregressions (BVAR) model. As shown in Figure 2 (solid lines and
shaded areas), a negative shock to the land price leads to a simultaneous rise in unemployment and a decline in the land price, consumption, investment, total hours, and vacancies.
A structural analysis of these stylized facts is essential for policy analysis as well as for
understanding business cycles in general.
The goal of this paper is to deliver a structural analysis of dynamic links between land
prices and unemployment and to establish the empirical relevance of this analysis. We
focus on land prices because fluctuations of house prices are largely driven by those of land
prices (Davis and Heathcote (2007)). To establish the links between the land price and the
unemployment rate, we combine the housing market and the labor market in one unified
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) framework. To fit the U.S. macroeconomic
time series, we introduce both financial and search-matching frictions in the model.
The model consists of three types of agents: households, capitalists, and firms. The
representative household consists of a continuum of workers—some are employed and others
are not. All workers consume the same amount of goods and housing services, so that
unemployment risks are pooled within the household. The representative capitalist owns all
firms, each of which employs one worker and operates a constant-returns-to-scale technology
that transforms labor, land, and capital into final consumption goods.
Capitalists’ consumption, investment, and land acquisition require external financing. We
assume an imperfect contract enforcement that limits the amount of loans by not only
capitalists’ capital value but also their land value (Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Iacoviello,
2005; Liu, Wang, and Zha, 2013). We model the labor market within the framework of
Diamond (1982), Mortensen (1982), and Pissarides (1985) (DMP hereafter).
Econometric estimation of our structural model shows that a negative housing demand
shock generates large and persistent comovements among the land price, the unemployment
rate, consumption, investment, vacancies, and total hours, consistent with the styled facts
revealed in Figure 2. Moreover, a shock that moves the land price is capable of generating
large volatility in unemployment, as we observe in the data. These results are not only
empirically important but economically substantive in several dimensions.
An important challenge for business cycle models built on the DMP theoretical framework
is to generate a large volatility of the labor market (Shimer, 2005). To meet this challenge,

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) and Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2005) argue that the
volatility of unemployment (relative to that of labor productivity) in DMP models can be
obtained by making the replacement ratio parameter extremely high. By replacing the standard Nash bargaining problem with the “alternating offer bargaining” strategy, Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013) show that their model with a lower value of the replacement ratio can account for a high volatility in the labor market according to the statistic
considered by Shimer (2005)—the ratio of the standard deviation of labor market tightness
to the standard deviation of aggregate labor productivity. We call this ratio “the Shimer
volatility ratio.”
The original analysis of Shimer (2005) emphasizes the effects of a stationary technology
shock. Our analysis focuses on a housing demand shock because this is the shock that can
move the land price in a significant way. In the context of our model, therefore, the key
question is whether the dynamic responses to a housing demand shock, without relying on
an extremely high replacement ratio of income for unemployed workers, can account for not
only the observed persistent fluctuations of standard macroeconomic variables but also the
observed high volatility of labor-market variables. The answer is provided by Figure 2 in
which the estimated responses from our DSGE model are consistent with the styled facts
evinced by the BVAR model. These estimates indicate that a 10% drop in the land price
would lead to an increase of the unemployment rate by 0.34 percentage points, relative to
its steady state value of 5.5%.
Equally important is our finding that the dynamic responses to a housing demand shock
can account for the observed high Shimer volatility ratio. In our data, the Shimer volatility
ratio is 24.91; in the data used by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013), the ratio
is 27.6 (see Section 6.4 and Table 6 in their paper). Using the simulated data from our
estimated DSGE model with housing demand shocks, we obtain a volatility ratio of 27.47.
The transmission of housing demand shocks to fluctuations in the land price and the
unemployment rate works through both the credit channel and the labor channel. The
credit channel embodies the dynamic interactions between the collateral value and the value
of a new employment match. A decline in housing demand lowers the equilibrium land
price and thus the collateral value of land. As the borrowing capacity for the capitalist
shrinks, investment spending falls as well. The decline in investment lowers future capital
stock. Since capital stock and workers are complementary factors of production, a decrease
in future capital stock lowers future marginal productivity of each employed worker and thus
reduces the present value of a new employment match. The firm responds by posting fewer
vacancies, leading to a fall in the job finding rate and a rise in the unemployment rate.
The labor channel represents endogenous wage rigidities in response to a decline in housing
demand. Our model has a non-separable utility function between consumption of goods and

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

3

housing services (Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel, 2007). Although consumption declines
following a negative shock to housing demand, the marginal utility of consumption also
declines because the shock has a direct impact on the marginal utility of consumption.
Ceteris paribus, a reduction in the marginal utility of consumption implies an increase in
the worker’s reservation value when the worker bargains with the firm for a wage rate. In
equilibrium, the bargained wage rate does decline because the economy contracts, but the
decline is substantially dampened because of this labor channel. This leads to large responses
of vacancies and unemployment.
The combination of the credit channel and the labor channel provides a statistically and
economically significant mechanism that explains not only the persistent comovement between the land price and the unemployment rate but also the resultant large volatility in the
labor market.

II. Literature review
Our work draws on two strands of literature: one on financial frictions and the other on
labor-market frictions. Since the recent recession, there has been a large and rapidly growing
strand of literature on the role of financial frictions and asset prices in macroeconomic fluctuations within the general equilibrium framework. The literature is too extensive to discuss
adequately. A partial list includes De Fiore and Uhlig (2005), Iacoviello (2005), Piazzesi,
Schneider, and Tuzel (2007), Gilchrist, Yankov, and Zakrajsek (2009), Iacoviello and Neri
(2010), Del Negro, Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Kiyotaki (2010), Hall (2011a), Jermann and
Quadrini (2012), Liu, Wang, and Zha (2013), Liu and Wang (Forthcoming), and Christiano,
Motto, and Rostagno (Forthcoming) (see Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) for a survey). This literature typically builds on the financial accelerator framework originally studied by Kiyotaki
and Moore (1997) and Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999).
The recent literature on labor-market frictions is also too large to list exhaustively. Examples are Gertler, Sala, and Trigari (2008), Lubik (2009), Justiniano and Michelacci (2011),
Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin (2011), and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt
(2013). Recent studies on potential links between financial factors and unemployment fluctuations are Chugh (2009), Davis, Fisher, and Veracierto (2010), Hall (2011b), Kocherlakota
(2011), Petrosky-Nadeau (2011), Monacelli, Quadrini, and Trigari (2011), Miao, Wang, and
Xu (2012), and Petrosky-Nadeau and Wasmer (2013).
Our paper places a different emphasis than the existing literature. We provide a first study
that integrates the housing market and the labor market within the DSGE framework and
uses the estimated structural model to account for the strong connections between land-price
dynamics and large unemployment fluctuations we observe in the data.

III. The Model
The economy is populated by three types of agents: households, capital producers, and
firms. Each type has a continuum of agents. The representative capital producer (i.e., the
capitalist) derives utility from consuming a final good produced by firms. The capitalist
has access to an investment technology that transforms consumption goods into capital
goods. The capitalist finances expenditures by both internal and external funds. Limited
contract enforcement implies that capitalists’ borrowing capacity is constrained by the value
of collateral assets—the land and capital stocks held by capitalists. Capitalists own firms. A
firm in an employment match hires one worker from the representative household and rents
capital and land from the representative capitalist to produce the final good.
The representative household consumes both goods and housing services (by owning the
land) and saves in the risk-free bond market. There is a continuum of workers within
the representative household. A fraction of workers is employed and the other fraction
(unemployed workers) searches for jobs in the frictional labor market. Firms post vacancies
at a fixed cost. An employment match is formed according to a matching technology that
combines searching workers and job vacancies to “produce” new employment matches.

where E [·] is the expectation operator, Cht denotes consumption, Lht denotes the household’s
land holdings, ht denotes labor hours (the intensive margin), and Nt denotes employment
(the extensive margin)—the fraction of household members who is employed.
The parameter βh ∈ (0, 1) denotes the subjective discount factor, χ denotes the weight
on labor disutility, ηh measures the household’s habit persistence, and γ is the risk aversion
parameter. Since consumption of goods grows over time while land supply and employment
do not, we scale consumption by the growth factor Ztp (i.e., the permanent component of the
technology shock) to obtain balanced growth. The variable ϕLt is a housing demand shock
that follows the stochastic process
ln ϕLt = (1 − ρL ) ln ϕL + ρL ln ϕL,t−1 + εLt ,

(2)

where ρL ∈ (−1, 1) is the persistence parameter and εLt is an i.i.d. white noise process with
mean zero and variance σL2 .
In the limiting case with γ = 1, the utility function (1) reduces to the standard separable

Following Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007), however, we find that maintaining nonseparability in the utility function helps generate the comovement among the land price,
consumption, and investment.
The household is initially endowed with Lh,−1 units of land and has no initial saving
Bh,−1 = 0. The household chooses consumption {Cht }, land holdings {Lht } , and saving
{Bht } to maximize the utility function in (1) subject to the sequence of budget constraints
Cht +

Bht
+ Qlt (Lht − Lh,t−1 ) = Bht−1 + Wt ht Nt + bZtp (1 − Nt ) − Tt ,
Rt

∀t ≥ 0,

(4)

where Bht denotes the saving, Rt denotes the risk-free interest rate, Qlt denotes the land
price, Wt denotes the wage rate, Nt denotes the fraction of workers employed, b denotes the
unemployment benefit, and Tt denotes lump-sum taxes. We follow Hall (2005) and scale the
unemployment benefit by Ztp , so that the unemployment benefit relative to labor income
remains stationary.
The household does not unilaterally choose ht or Nt . Instead, as we describe below, these
variables are determined in the labor market equilibrium with search and matching frictions.
III.2. Capitalists. The representative capitalist has the utility function
E

X

βct ln (Cct − ηc Cct−1 ) ,

(5)

t=0

where βc ∈ (0, 1) denotes the capitalist’s subjective discount factor, Cct denotes consumption,
and ηc is the habit persistence parameter.
The capitalist is initially endowed with K−1 units of capital and Lc,−1 units of land, with
no initial debt. The capitalist faces the flow-of-funds constraint
Cct + Qlt (Lct − Lc,t−1 ) + It + Φ (et ) Kt−1 + Bc,t−1 =

Bct
+ Rkt et Kt−1 + Rlt Lc,t−1 + Πt , (6)
Rt

where Lct , It , et , Kt , Bct , Rkt , Rlt , and Πt denote the capitalist’s land holdings, investment,
the capacity utilization rate, the end-of-period capital stock, the debt level, the rental rate
of capital, the rental rate of land, and dividends collected from firms, respectively.
The cost of capacity utilization Φ(e) is an increasing and convex function given by
Φ (et ) = γ1 (et − 1) +

γ2
(et − 1)2 ,
2

(7)

where the slope and curvature parameters, γ1 and γ2 , are both non-negative.
The capitalist finances consumption, acquisitions of new land, and investment expenditures by both internal funds and external credit. We assume that βc < βh and the amount
the capitalist can borrow is limited by a fraction of their collateral value. This assumption ensures that the borrowing constraint for the capitalist binds in a neighborhood of the
deterministic steady state.

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

Denote by Qkt the shadow price of capital (i.e., Tobin’s q). The collateral constraint is
given by
Bct ≤ ξt Et (ω1 Ql,t+1 Lct + ω2 Qk,t+1 Kt ) ,

(8)

where ω1 and ω2 are the parameters that determine the weight of land and capital in the
collateral value. The collateral constraint here is motivated by the limited contract enforcement problem emphasized by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). If the capitalist fails to repay the
loan, the lender can seize the collateral. Since liquidation is costly, the lender can recoup up
to a fraction of the value of collateral assets, which is denoted by ξt . We interpret ξt as a
collateral shock and assume that it follows the stochastic process
ln ξt = (1 − ρξ ) ln ξ + ρξ ln ξt−1 + εξt,

(9)

where ρξ ∈ (−1, 1) is the persistence parameter and εξt is an i.i.d. white noise process with
mean zero and variance σξ2 .
The capitalist has access to an investment technology that transforms consumption goods
into productive capital. In particular, given the beginning-of-period capital stock Kt−1 , the
capitalist can transform It units of consumption goods into Kt units of new capital. Thus,
the law of motion of the capital stock is given by

(10)

where δ ∈ (0, 1) denotes the depreciation rate of capital, Ω > 0 is the adjustment cost
parameter, and γI denotes the steady-state growth rate of investment.
III.3. The labor market. At the beginning of period t, there are ut unemployed workers
searching for jobs and there are vt vacancies posted by firms. The matching technology is
described by the Cobb-Douglas function
mt = ϕmt uat vt1−a ,

(11)

where a ∈ (0, 1) is the elasticity of job matches with respect to the number of searching workers. The variable ϕmt is an exogenous matching efficiency shock that follows the stochastic
process
ln ϕmt = (1 − ρm ) ln ϕm + ρm ln ϕm,t−1 + εmt ,

(12)

where ρm ∈ (−1, 1) is the persistence parameter and εmt is an i.i.d. white noise process with

mean zero and variance σm

The probability that an open vacancy is matched with a searching worker, the job filling
rate, is given by
qtv =

The probability that an unemployed and searching worker is matched with an open vacancy,
the job finding rate, is given by

the number of employed workers at the beginning of period t. Before
qtu =

matching takes place, a fraction ρ of workers lose their jobs. The number of workers who
survive job separations is (1 − ρ)Nt−1 . Thus, the number of unemployed workers searching
for jobs in period t is given by
ut = 1 − (1 − ρ)Nt−1 ,

(15)

where we have assumed full labor-force participation. After matching takes place, the number
of jobless workers who find jobs is mt . Thus, aggregate employment evolves according to the
law of motion
Nt = (1 − ρ) Nt−1 + mt .

(16)

Following Blanchard and Galı́ (2010), we assume that newly hired workers start working
within the same period. Thus, the number of productive workers in period t is given by Nt .
At the end of period t, the number of unemployed workers equals those searching workers
who fail to find a match. Thus, as in Blanchard and Galı́ (2010), the unemployment rate is
given by
Ut = ut − mt = 1 − Nt .

(17)

III.4. Firms. A firm can produce only if it can be successfully matched with a worker.1 A
firm with a worker rents capital kt and land lct from the capitalist. It produces the final

Ztp and a transitory (stationary) component Ztm such that Zt = Ztp Ztm . The permanent

Denote by JtF the value of a new employment match. A firm matched with a worker
obtains profits in the current-period production. In the next period, if the match survives
(with probability 1 − ρ), the firm continues to receive the match value; otherwise, the firm
receives the value of an open vacancy (Vt ). Thus, the match value is given by

JtF = πt − Wt ht + Et

Λct

(21)

where πt denotes profit prior to wage payments, Wt denotes the wage rate, ht denotes the
hours worked, and Λct denotes the marginal utility of consumption for capitalists who own
the firm.
The profit πt prior to wage payments is obtained by solving the production problem

If the firm posts a job vacancy, it pays a vacancy cost κ. If the vacancy is filled (with
probability qtv ), then the firm obtains the value JtF . Otherwise, the firm carries the vacancy
to the next period. The value of an open vacancy Vt satisfies the asset-pricing equation
Vt = −κZtp + qtv JtF + (1 − qtv ) Et

βc Λc,t+1
Vt+1 .
Λct

(23)

We scale the vacancy cost by the growth factor Ztp to keep stationary the ratio of this cost
to output.
Free entries imply that Vt = 0 for all t. It follows from Equation (23) that
JtF =

κZtp
.
qtv

(24)

This condition characterizes optimal vacancy posting decisions. If the firm posts a vacancy,
it needs to pay the flow cost κZtp . In each period, the vacancy is filled with probability qtv .
Thus, the expected duration of the vacancy before it is filled is 1/qtv . The optimal vacancy
posting decision (24) equates the benefit of a new employment match to the expected cost
of posting and maintaining a vacancy.
III.5. Nash bargaining. When a job match is formed, a firm and a worker bargain over
wages and hours in a Nash bargaining game. The worker’s surplus is the difference between
the value of employment and the value of unemployment. The firm’s surplus is just the value
of the firm JtF because the value of an open vacancy Vt is driven to zero by free entries. We
have specified the match value in the preceding section. We now describe the worker’s value
function.
If employed, the worker receives a wage payment in the current period, although suffers
disutility from working. In the next period, the worker may lose the job with probability
u
ρ and cannot find a new job with probability 1 − qt+1
(recall that q u is the job finding

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

rate). In that event, the worker obtains the present value of unemployment. Otherwise, the
worker continues to have a job and receives the employment value. Specifically, the value of
employment (denoted by JtW ) is given by

ln ϑt = (1 − ρϑ ) ln ϑ + ρϑ ln ϑt−1 + εϑt ,

(28)

where ρϑ measures the persistence of the bargaining shock and εϑt is an i.i.d. normal process
with mean zero and variance σϑ2 .
It is straightforward to show that the bargaining solutions for the wage rate and labor
hours satisfy the following two equations:

The last equation implies that the value of the marginal product of hours is equal to the
marginal rate of substitution between leisure and consumption. This condition is exactly the
same as in the competitive labor market in the real business cycle literature. The condition
obtains because the correct measure of the cost of hours to the firm is the marginal rate of
substitution. Unlike the real business cycle literature, however, the wage rate is no longer
allocative for hours due to the search and matching frictions.

III.6. The government. The government finances unemployment benefit payments through
lump-sum taxes. We assume that the government balances the budget in each period so that
bZtp (1 − Nt ) = Tt .

We abstract from government spending for the clarity of our analysis.
III.7. Search equilibrium. In equilibrium, the markets for bond, housing, capital, and
consumption all clear.
The bond market clearing condition is given by
Bct = Bht ≡ Bt ,

(32)

where Bt denotes the equilibrium level of debt for capitalists.
The land market clearing condition is given by
Lct + Lht = 1,

(33)

where we normalize the supply of land to 1.
The capital market clearing condition is given by

The aggregate resource constraint clears the goods market:

and labor hours determined from the bilateral bargaining between firms and workers, and
(v) the land market, the capital market, the bond market, and the goods market all clear.

IV. Estimation
To fit the model to the data, we first log-linearize the stationary equilibrium conditions,
reported in Appendix B, around the deterministic steady state in which the collateral constraint is binding. The model with six shocks is then confronted with six quarterly U.S. time
series from 1975Q1 to 2012Q4: the real land price, per capita real consumption, per capita
real investment, the vacancy rate, the unemployment rate, and per capita total hours. We
provide a detailed descriptions of the data and the model shocks in Appendix C.
We apply the Bayesian method to estimation of the model. Since shocks to housing
demand drive almost all the fluctuations in the land price and since our paper is to study the
dynamic links between the land price and the unemployment rate, our subsequent discussions
revolve around understanding the macroeconomic and labor-market effects of a shock to
housing demand.2
Some parameter values are fixed prior to estimation, because they are not identified within
the model. Appendix D discuss what these parameters are and how they are calibrated. One
parameter we highlight here is the risk aversion parameter. As the labor channel discussed in
the introduction works through non-separability of the household’s utility function between
consumption and housing services, we set the relative risk aversion parameter γ = 2 as a
benchmark to be in line with the literature (Kocherlakota, 1996; Lucas Jr., 2003).
Table 1 reports the estimated posterior mode and the 90% probability interval of each
structural parameter (the last 3 columns), along with the prior distributions for comparison.
The table shows that capitalists have a much stronger habit formation than households (0.98
vs. 0.22). Strong habit formation for capitalists helps smooth their consumption and amplify
fluctuations in investment following a shock to housing demand. Since firms are owned by
capitalists, strong habit formation implies high volatility in the stochastic discount factor for
firms, which allows the model to generate large fluctuations in the value of a new employment
match. Fluctuations in the match value in our model are key to generating large volatilities
in job vacancies and unemployment.
The estimated value of the investment adjustment cost parameter (Ω = 0.14) is very small
compared to the DSGE literature without financial frictions. A small adjustment cost parameter implies low volatility in the shadow price of capital (Tobin’s q). Thus, the collateral
channel works mainly through interactions between debt and land value. Consistent with
this finding, the estimated weight on capital value in the collateral constraint is considerably
smaller than that on land value (ω2 = 0.14 vs. the normalized value of ω1 = 1).

2Appendix

D provides a detailed description of prior distributions for the structural parameters and

Appendix E discusses some estimation issues.

The estimated parameter values for the capacity utilization function imply a large elasticity
of the capital rental rate with respect to capacity utilization (the elasticity γ2 /γ1 is about
16 in magnitude). Since the capital rental rate does not fluctuate much in our model, the
large elasticity implies small fluctuations in capacity utilization. Thus, the model does not
rely on variable capacity utilization to fit the data.
The estimated curvature parameter of the disutility function of labor hours is small
(ν = 0.027). This finding, however, does not contradict the microeconomic evidence of
a small Frisch elasticity of labor hours. In particular, in a model with credit constraints and
adjustment costs, there is in general no direct mapping from the preference parameter ν to
the intertemporal labor supply elasticity (Keane and Rogerson, 2011). In our model, a small
value of ν allows necessary fluctuations in labor hours (the intensive margin) to prevent the
model from “overshooting” the volatility of unemployment. We discuss the overshooting
phenomenon in Section VI.2.
The estimates of the remaining structural parameters, δ, βh , βc , φ, λz , and ϕL , are broadly
in line with those obtained in the literature (Iacoviello, 2005; Liu, Wang, and Zha, 2013).
Table 2 shows the prior and posterior distributions of shock parameters. We follow the
DSGE literature and assume that the prior for the persistence parameters takes the beta
distribution and the prior for the volatility parameters takes the inverse-gamma distribution.
We select the hyperparameters for these prior distributions to obtain a reasonably broad
90% probability interval for each parameter. The posterior mode estimates indicate that
the housing demand shock process is most persistent and volatile. This shock process, as
we show in Section V, is most important in driving the persistent comovement between the
land price and the unemployment rate as well as large fluctuations in unemployment.

V. Dynamic interactions between the land price and the labor market
We now use the estimated model to assess the empirical importance of dynamic interactions between the land price and labor-market variables. We begin with a discussion of
the macroeconomic effects of land-price dynamics. We then analyze how the labor market
fluctuates with changes in the land price. We conclude by quantifying the large volatility of
labor-market variables.
Figures 3 reports the impulse responses of standard macroeconomic variables in response
to a negative housing demand shock. The error bands for the impulse responses are generated
according to the methodology suggested by Sims and Uhlig (1991) and Sims and Zha (1999).
The shock leads to a persistent decline in the land price. The decline in the land value tightens
capitalists’ borrowing capacity, which in turn reduces their land acquisition, labor hours for
employed workers, and business investment.

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

13

Figure 4 reports the impulse responses of labor-market variables in response to a negative
housing demand shock, along with the error bands. As investment falls, the future capital stock declines and the resultant marginal product of employment (the output value of
additional employment) falls. Hence, the present value of a new employment match falls,
reducing the benefit of forming an employment match. Firms respond by posting fewer job
vacancies. Consequently, the job finding rate for unemployed workers declines, leading to
higher equilibrium unemployment as the land price declines.
To see how our structural model fits to the data, we reproduce in Figure 2 the dynamic
responses to a negative housing demand shock in the estimated DSGE model (asterisk lines)
against the 90% probability bands for the BVAR estimated impulse responses (shaded areas).
The DSGE results fit the stylized facts surprisingly well in both dimensions: comovement and
volatility. Not only does the estimated DSGE model generate the observed comovements
between the land price and the standard macroeconomic and labor-market variables, but
more importantly the model generates the observed large volatility in the labor market as
well. Given how restrictive our DSGE model is, these results are remarkable.
Consistent with the data, fluctuations of labor-market variables in our DSGE model are
large in magnitude relative to those in the land price and the standard macroeconomic
variables. In particular, our impulse responses indicate that a 10% drop in the land price
leads to a rise in the unemployment rate (relative to its steady state) by 0.34 percentage
points.
Shimer (2005) emphasizes a special statistic for measuring the volatility of the labor market: the ratio of the standard deviation of labor market tightness (vacancies divided by
unemployment) to the standard deviation of aggregate labor productivity. To compute the
Shimer volatility ratio, we use the estimated model to simulate a long sequence (100,000 periods) of series. Following Shimer (2005) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013),
we first HP-filter both the simulated series and the actual data and then compute the Shimer
volatility ratio. For the data set used for this paper, the ratio is 24.91. For the data set used
by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013), the ratio is 27.6 (Table 6 in their paper).
The Shimer volatility ratio for our simulated series is 27.47.
Both the estimated impulse responses and the computed Shimer volatility ratio evince
our model’s ability to account for the dynamic links between the land price and the unemployment rate as well as the large volatility of unemployment. In Section VI we explore the
economic intuition behind these results.

VI. Understanding the economic mechanism
In this section we analyze the economic mechanism behind our estimated results. We
identify two key channels for the transmission and amplification of housing demand shocks
to the aggregate economy and the labor market.
VI.1. The credit channel. As shown both in the data (Figure 2) and in our structural
estimation (Figure 3), the fall of the land price is driven by a negative housing demand shock.
Due to the credit constraint, this fall directly reduces capitalists’ land value and borrowing
capacity, resulting in the fall of business investment (Liu, Wang, and Zha, 2013).
We now illustrate a transmission channel through which the value of a new employment
match, JtF , declines as a result of declining investment. We call this transmission the “credit
channel.” Recall the optimal equation for the value of a new employment match:

α
βc Λct+1
φ 1−φ
F
(1 − ρ) Jt+1
.
JtF = (1 − α)Zt1−α+αφ lct
kt
h1−α
− Wt ht + Et
t
Λct

(37)

The first term on the right-hand side is derived from equation (22) and can be interpreted as
the marginal productivity of employed workers. Because a reduction in capitalists’ investment leads to a reduction in future capital stocks, future marginal productivity of employed
workers falls. For any given real wage and labor hours, the decline in future marginal productivity reduces the present value of a new employment match.3
How the fall of the new employment value is transmitted into the labor market is illustrated
in Figure 5. The figure plots the Beveridge curve (the inverse relation between vacancies and
unemployment derived from the matching function) and the job creation curve (the positive
relation between vacancies and unemployment derived from the free-entry condition).4 The
Beveridge curve (BC), derived from the matching function (11), implies that
 1

1 − u 1−a
ρ
,
v=
ϕm (1 − ρ) uα
where we have imposed the steady-state relations that m = ρN and 1 − u = (1 − ρ)N. The
job creation curve (JCC) derived from the free-entry condition (24) implies that

1
JF a
v = ϕm

where we have used the relation q v = ϕm uv
derived from the definition of q v and the
matching function. Thus, the slope of the JCC depends positively on matching efficiency
and the value of a new employment match, and negatively on vacancy costs.
3For the clarity of our argument,

we postpone discussions of how the dynamics of wages and hours influence

the equilibrium outcome until Section VI.2.
4This illustration draws from Pissarides (2000, Chapters 1 & 2). A similar graph is used by Leduc and
Liu (2012), who study the macroeconomic effects of uncertainty shocks.

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

15

The intersection of the BC and the JCC determines the equilibrium vacancies and unemployment. Consider the initial equilibrium at point A, corresponding to the steady state.
As discussed in the earlier part of this section, a fall of business investment in response to
a negative housing demand shock causes the present value of a new employment match to
fall. The decline of the match value JtF rotates the job creation curve downward as shown
in Figure 5. The economy moves along the downward-sloping Beveridge curve to a new
equilibrium, with fewer job vacancies and a higher unemployment rate (point B).
To assess the full impact of this credit channel on the labor market, we consider a counterfactual economy in which the amount of credit capitalists can obtain does not vary with
their land and capital value such that their borrowing capacity remains at the steady-state
level. By construction, therefore, the credit channel is muted. The dynamic responses of the
key macroeconomic and labor-market variables to a negative housing demand shock in this
counterfactual economy are displayed Figure 6, along with those from the estimated model.
The figure shows starkly different impulse responses to the housing demand shock between the counterfactual economy (solid lines) and the estimated economy (asterisk lines).
In the counterfactual economy, capitalists’ borrowing capacity is not affected by the decline
in the land price driven by the housing demand shock. As land becomes cheaper, capitalists’ effective resources available for purchasing investment goods actually rise. Thus, the
counterfactual economy fails to generate business-cycle comovements because investment,
output, and labor hours all rise whereas consumption (not shown) and the land price both
decline. The effects on the value of a new employment match and thus on unemployment
are muted by the absence of the credit channel.

VI.2. The labor channel. A negative shock to housing demand, through the credit channel, sparks off a simultaneous decline in the land price and business investment, which in turn
reduces the value of a job match, discourages firms from posting vacancies, and thus leads to
higher unemployment. But a decline in business investment alone is insufficient to produce
a significant rise in unemployment. The reason is that, without wage rigidities, a drop in
the wage rate would partially offset the effects of lower investment on the match value. One
prominent example is a negative stationary technology shock. As Figure 7 shows, this shock
in the estimated model (solid lines) leads to a large decline in business investment but fails
to produce a large increase in unemployment. The result is not surprising as it confirms
the finding of Shimer (2005) and others. The intuition is that real wages fall considerably,
blunting the shock’s impact on unemployment.
A negative shock to housing demand is capable of generating large increases in unemployment because it is channeled through a second transmission route that produces endogenous
wage rigidities. We call this transmission the “labor channel.” To explain how the labor

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

channel works, we rewrite the Nash bargained wage equation (29) as

A negative technology shock reduces the value of an employment match and the number of
vacancy postings. The decreased job finding rate raises the unemployment duration, which
weakens the workers’ bargaining position and reduces the equilibrium wage rate. As shown
in the Nash bargaining wage equation above, the wage rate decreases when the match value
(JtF ) falls or when the unemployment duration (1/q u ) rises. To be sure, a negative housing
demand shock raises the unemployment duration with similar logic. But the impact works
indirectly through the credit channel discussed in the preceding section.
The main difference, however, stems from the household side. Households’ reactions to
a housing demand shock differs from their reactions to a technology shock. A negative
technology shock reduces consumption substantially, as shown in Figure 7. The resultant
sharp increase in households’ marginal utility (Λh ) reduces the worker’s reservation value
and reinforces the effect of the increase in the unemployment duration. Consequently, the
worker is willing to accept a lower wage offer. In equilibrium the decline in real wages limits
firms’ desire to contract employment, rendering the impact on unemployment small.
By contrast, a negative housing demand shock makes land less desirable for households so
that they prefer to increase consumption. In the mean time, interactions between the land
price and business investment amplify the impact of a housing demand shock on the land
price, leading to sharp declines in the land price. As land becomes cheaper, the household
would like to purchase more land and to reduce consumption. These two effects offset each
other, leading to small fluctuations in consumption and in the marginal utility of consumption
(Figure 7). When the utility function is non-separable, moreover, a negative housing demand
shock directly lowers the marginal utility of consumption, thereby raising the workers’ threat
point in wage bargaining. The resultant decline in the marginal utility offsets the effect of
the increase in the unemployment duration, creating less incentives for workers to accept
lower wages.
As shown in Figure 7, the response of households’ marginal utility to a housing demand
shock (asterisk line) is an order of magnitude smaller than that to a technology shock (solid
line). Consequently, the real wage does not change much following a housing demand shock
while the value of a job match falls substantially. This leads to large responses of vacancies
and unemployment.
While wage rigidities are crucial to the dynamic connections between the land price and
the unemployment, how labor hours per employed worker (the intensive margin) adjust to
changes in housing demand plays another important but different role in determining the
effectiveness of the labor channel on unemployment dynamics. To see this point, consider a

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

17

counterfactual economy in which the supply of labor hours is inelastic so that equilibrium
labor hours do not respond to any shocks. We compare the dynamic responses to a negative
housing demand shock in this counterfactual economy to those in the estimated economy
in Figure 6. In the counterfactual economy with inelastic supply of labor hours (dashed
lines), the land price falls along with investment and output as in the estimated economy
(asterisk lines). But both the match value and unemployment in the counterfactual economy
overshoot the responses in the estimated economy. Since firms cannot reduce labor hours (the
intensive margin), they rely more on adjusting employment (the extensive margin).5 Because
firms cannot cut costs by reducing hours, the value of an employment match declines more
than in the estimated economy so that firms reduce vacancy postings more aggressively. As
a consequence, the responses of unemployment overshoot those in the baseline economy.
The above analysis demonstrates that the credit and labor channels reinforce each other
to transmit the fluctuations in the land price into a large volatility in the labor market that
is consistent with the data.

VII. Conclusion
The dynamic relationships between the land price and the unemployment rate are strong
in the data. We construct and estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model to account
for these relationships as well as those with other key macroeconomic variables. The estimated dynamic responses to a housing demand shock generate these comovements among
the macroeconomic variables. More significant is our empirical finding that the dynamic
response of the unemployment rate is large enough, relative to the output fluctuation, to
achieve a high volatility ratio of the market tightness to labor productivity as stressed by
Shimer (2005).
To understand how the DMP labor market interacts with the housing market, we focus on obtaining a transparent economic mechanism that drives our empirical results, and
thus abstract from a host of other features which we could incorporate in future research.
Miao, Wang, and Zha (2013), for example, provide a deeper interpretation of the housing
demand shock and decompose it into three structural shocks for the purpose of explaining
the wedge between the house (land) price and the rental price. Galı́, Smets, and Wouters
(2011) take an explicit account of labor participation dynamics in their general equilibrium
model. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013) offers an alternative framework for
wage negotiations and focus their analysis on how the labor market responds to technology
shocks as well as monetary policy shocks. It is our hope that the economic analysis provided

the counterfactual economy, the decline of total hours is entirely driven by the decline of employment

since labor hours per employed worker are fixed.

Appendix A. An equivalent setup with the large representative firm
In this appendix, we show that our model in the text is equivalent to an alternative setup
with one large representative firm as in the real business cycles (RBC) literature.6 In this
alternative setup, the decision problems for households and capitalists are identical to those
in the baseline model presented in the text. The environment for firms is different. Instead
of the one-firm one-worker setup in the baseline model, we assume that there is one large
representative firm. The firm employs Nt workers in each period, combined with capital
and land to produce output. The firm bargains with the marginal worker who is seeking
for a job to determine the wage rate and average hours. Once the wage rate and hours are
determined, they apply to all active workers. We continue to assume that capitalists own
the firm.
We begin with the representative household’s problem. Denote by Vht (Nt−1 ) the value
function of the household. It satisfies the Bellman equation:

as
StH ≡

.
Λht
∂Nt

(A1)

This is the marginal value to the household when a new member is employed. Note that we
consider a marginal change in Nt because a newly hired worker immediately starts working
as in Blanchard and Galı́ (2010).
By the envelope condition,
∂Vht (Nt−1 )

where marginal utility of consumption Λht is equal to the Lagrange multiplier associated
with the budget constraint (4).
Note that
Nt = (1 − ρ)Nt−1 + mt

= (1 − ρ)Nt−1 + qtu [1 − (1 − ρ)Nt−1 ] .

Since the household takes the job finding rate qtu as given when an additional worker is hired,
one can compute that
∂Nt
= (1 − ρ) − qtu (1 − ρ) = (1 − qtu ) (1 − ρt ) .

Now, consider the representative firm’s problem. The firm chooses capital and labor inputs

Wages and hours are determined by Nash bargaining between the marginal worker and
the representative firm. As in the standard DMP framework, when an additional worker is

Appendix C. Data and shocks
C.1. Data description. All data are constructed by Patrick Higgins at the Federal Reserve
Bank of Atlanta. Some of the data are taken directly from the Haver Analytics Database
(Haver for short). This section describes, in detail, how the data are constructed.
The model estimation is based on six U.S. aggregate time series: the real price of land
(QData
), real per capita consumption (CtData ), real per capita investment (ItData ), vacancies
lt
(vtData ), the unemployment rate (UtData ), and per capita total hours (HtData ). All these series
are constructed to be consistent with the corresponding series in Greenwood, Hercowitz, and
Krusell (1997), Cummins and Violante (2002), and Davis and Heathcote (2007). Since the

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

34

earliest date for the land price data to be available is the first quarter of 1975, the sample
period used for this paper range from the first quarter of 1975 to the fourth quarter of 2012.
These series are defined as follows:

The original data, the constructed data, and their sources are described below.
LiqLandPricesSAFHFACoreLogicSplice87: Liquidity-adjusted price index for residential land. The series is constructed as follows. We seasonally adjust the FHFA
home price index (USHPI@USECON) for 1975Q1-1991Q1, spliced together with
Haver’s seasonally adjusted CoreLogic home price index (USLPHPIS@USECON)
for the third month of the first quarter of 1987 to present. We then use this home
price index to construct the land price series with the Davis and Heathcote (2007)
method.7 The adjustment methods of Quart and Quigley (1989, 1991) are used to
take account of time-on-market uncertainty. The CoreLogic home price index series
provided by Core Logic Databases is similar to the Case-Shiller home price index but
covers far more counties than the Case-Shiller series.
The CoreLogic land price, as well as the Cash-Shiller land price, shows much larger
fluctuations than the FHFA land price. The large difference comes mainly from home
price indices. The FHFA home price series includes only conforming/conventional
mortgages insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and excludes subprime or expensive homes with mortgages above the conforming loan limit ($417,000 in 2008
for example). The FHFA series is an equally weighted home price index so that
expensive homes receive the same weight as inexpensive homes. The CoreLogic and
Case-Shiller series are both value-weighted so that a home’s weight in the index is
(roughly) proportional to its price. The FHFA series is perhaps representative of the
home price before 1987. But in the 1990s and 2000s, subprime or un-conforming
mortgages were so popular that an exclusion of the prices of such homes would bias
against the actual volatility of home/land prices. The volatility of our CoreLogic land
price series is similar to the land price series constructed in other studies (Sirmans
and Slade, 2012; Nichols, Oliner, and Mulhall, 2013).

C.2. Shocks. We include six shocks in the model: a housing demand shock (ϕLt ), a credit
shock (ξt ), two technology shocks (the permanent shock λzt and the stationary shock Ztm ),
and two labor market shocks (the matching efficiency shock ϕmt and the bargaining shock
ϑt ). Housing demand shocks are shown to be an important driving force of house-price (landprice) fluctuations in DSGE models without labor search frictions (Iacoviello and Neri, 2010;
Liu, Wang, and Zha, 2013). Credit shocks are important for macroeconomic fluctuations in
a DSGE model with financial frictions (Jermann and Quadrini, 2012). Technology shocks
are typically considered as important sources of business cycles in an RBC model.
The matching efficiency shock and the bargaining shock are useful to fit our model to
the labor-market data. The matching function describes a reduced-form aggregate relation
between the number of hires on one hand and the number of searching workers and job
vacancies on the other. There is no presumption that this reduced-form relation holds
exactly in the data. In fact, frequent deviations to this relation have been observed. For
examples, in our sample, there have been important shifts in the Beveridge curve relation (a
relation between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate derived from the matching
function). Shifts in the Beveridge curve can be captured by variations in the matching
efficiency (i.e., the residuals in the matching function).
Recent studies find that incorporating matching efficiency shocks is important for fitting
a DSGE model to the labor market data (Lubik, 2009; Justiniano and Michelacci, 2011;
Sala, Söderström, and Trigari, 2012). Other studies find that introducing shocks to the
relative bargaining power in a DSGE model with search frictions helps fit the data for labor
market variables (Gertler, Sala, and Trigari, 2008; Christoffel, Kuester, and Linzert, 2009;
Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin, 2011). We are aware of the legitimate criticism that
these shocks do not offer a deeper understanding of the labor market. Since our focus is on
the dynamic links between the land price and the unemployment rate, we use these shocks
to be consistent with the existing literature as well as for the purpose of fitting the model
to the data without insisting on interpretation of these shocks’ effect on the labor market.
Appendix D. Prior distributions for structural parameters
We categorize the structural parameters in three groups. The first group of parameters are
calibrated because they are difficult to identify by the model. These parameters are a, the
elasticity parameter in the matching function; b, the flow benefit of unemployment; ϑ, the
Nash bargaining weight; α, the income share of capital input; γ, the relative risk aversion;
ξ, the average loan-to-value ratio; ρ, the job separation rate; ω1 , the fraction of land value
that can be used as collateral; and Z m , the mean of the stationary technology shock.
We set the match elasticity parameter to a = 0.5 as suggested by Hall and Milgrom (2008)
and Gertler and Trigari (2009), which is in the range estimated by Petrongolo and Pissarides

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

37

(2001). Following Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013), we set the replacement
ratio to

b
W

= 0.75, where W is the steady-state real wage.10 We set the value of ϑ such

that the worker’s bargaining weight is

ϑ
1+ϑ

= 0.3 as estimated by Christiano, Trabandt, and

Walentin (2011). We set α = 0.33, consistent with the average labor income share of about
two-thirds. We set the risk aversion parameter to γ = 2, in line with in the macroeconomics
and finance literature (Kocherlakota, 1996; Lucas Jr., 2003). Following Liu, Wang, and Zha
(2013), we set the mean value of the loan-to-value ratio to ξ = 0.75. We set the job separation
rate to ρ = 0.12 as suggested by Blanchard and Galı́ (2010), which is broadly consistent with
the average monthly job separation rate of 0.034 reported in the Job Openings and Labor
Turnover Survey (JOLTS). We normalize the values of ω1 and Z m to unity.
The second group of structural parameters are estimated. They are ηh and ηc , the habit
persistence parameters for households and capitalists; ν, the curvature parameter of the
dis-utility function of labor hours; γ2 , the curvature parameter of the capacity utilization
cost function; Ω, the investment adjustment cost parameter; λz , the mean growth rate of
technology; ω2 , the fraction of capital value in the collateral constraint; λz , the mean growth
rate; and all the parameters for shock processes. The complete prior specifications are
reported in Tables 3 and 4. Tables 1 and 2 reproduce some of the prior information for
comparison with the estimated posterior distributions.
We first discuss Table 3. The prior for the technology growth rate λz is such that the
90-percent probability interval for the annualized growth rate lies between 0.4% and 6%.
We assume that the priors for ηh and ηc follow the beta distribution with the hyperparameters taking the values of 1 and 2. This particular specification allows the possibility of no
persistence at all for the habit parameters. Clearly, the 90% probability interval covers most
of the calibrated values of habit persistence parameters in the literature (Boldrin, Christiano,
and Fisher, 2001).
The priors for the remaining parameters to be estimated follow gamma distributions, all
of which allow the possibility of zero value. The 90% probability interval for Ω and γ2 ranges
from 0.17 to 10, covering most of the values considered in the DSGE literature (Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Evans, 2005; Smets and Wouters, 2007; Liu, Waggoner, and Zha, 2011).
The hyperparameter values for the prior distributions of ν and ω2 are selected so that the
90% probability intervals for these parameters cover a wide range of values.
We now discuss Table 4. The selected hyperparameters for the prior distributions of all
the persistence parameters allow the possibility of zero persistence and at the same time
give a wide range of values as shown by the 90% probability intervals. The priors for the
standard deviations follow the inverse gamma distribution with the 90% probability interval
10Our

estimated results are insensitive to the value of the replacement ratio. For example, the results

hold if we lower the ratio to

b
W

= 0.4 as suggested by Ravenna and Walsh (2008) and Hall (2005).

LAND PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

38

given by [0.0001, 2]. The priors for all these shock process parameters are very agnostic and
in fact much looser than those used in the DSGE literature.
The third group of structural parameters are determined by the deterministic steady
state, conditional on calibrated and estimated values of the first two groups of parameters.
These parameters include δ, the capital depreciation rate; βh and βc , the subjective discount
factors for households and capitalists; φ, the land income share; γ1 , the slope parameter in
the capacity utilization function; ϕL , the steady-state level of the housing demand shock; χ,
the scale parameter for the disutility of working; and κ, the vacancy cost parameter.
The values of these parameters are obtained so that the model’s steady-state equilibrium
matches the following first-moment conditions in the data: (1) the investment-output ratio
is 0.26; (2) the average loan interest rate is 4% per year; (3) the average ratio of commercial
land value to annual output is about 0.625 (Liu, Wang, and Zha, 2013); (4) the average ratio
of capital stock to annual output is 1.25;11 (5) the average ratio of the vacancy cost to output
is 0.005 (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt, 2013); (6) the steady-state unemployment
rate is 0.055; (7) the average quarterly job filling rate is about 0.7 (den Haan, Ramey, and
Watson, 2000).
Given the calibrated parameter values, the prior distributions of the first two groups of
parameters, and the steady state equilibrium, we simulate the prior distributions for the
third group of parameters. The 90% probability intervals for these parameters are reported
in the bottom panel of Table 3.
Appendix E. Estimation issues
We use our own algorithm to estimate the structural model. One natural question is
why we do not avail ourselves of Dynare. There are two layers of problems. First, as
one can see from Appendix B, the steady state is too complicated for Dynare to solve it
efficiently. Second, the posterior distribution is full of thin winding ridges as well as local
peaks, finding its mode has proven to be a difficult task. More than often Dynare either
terminates prematurely in finding the peak or stops because of the failure of solving the
steady state. At the premature solution, one would conclude with a misleading result that
land-price dynamics have very small effects on unemployment.
Our own optimization routine, based on Sims, Waggoner, and Zha (2008) and coded in
C/C++, has proven to be both efficient and able to find the posterior mode. The routine
relies in part on the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) updates of the inverse
of the Hessian matrix. When the inverse Hessian matrix is close to be numerically illconditioned, our program resets it to a diagonal matrix. Given an initial guess of the values of
the parameters, our program uses a combination of a constrained optimization algorithm and

an unconstrained BFGS optimization routine, to find a local peak. We then use the local peak
to generate a long sequence of Monte Carlo Markov Chain posterior draws. These simulated
draws are randomly selected as different starting points for our optimization routine to find
a potentially higher peak. We iterate this process until the highest peak is found. The
computation typically takes four and a half days on a cluster of five dual-core processors.
We are in the process of collaborating with the Dynare team to incorporate our estimation
software into the Dynare package.
