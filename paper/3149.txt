DOES PERFORMANCE-BASED MANACERIAL COMPENSATION
AFFECT SUBSEQUENT CORPORATE PERFORMANCE?

ABSTRACT
An effective performance-based compensation system must increase the probability of
high performance corporate outcomes in order to justify the incremental expense relative

to a straight salary system.

A positive relation between current performance and current

compensation indicates that the pay system is performance-based in practice,

explicitly.

if not

This study considers whether increasing the sensitivity of current

compensation to current performance is associated with higher performance in the future.

For accounting-based performance measures, there is only weak evidence that greater
performance-based compensation is associated with improved future performance.

for economic and market performance measures, there is stronger evidence.

However,

Payment of an

incremental 10' bonus for good economic performance is associated with a 30 to 90 basis

point increase in the expected after tax gross economic return in the following fiscal

year.

Payment of an incremental raise of 10' following a good stock market performance is

associated with a 400 to 1200 basis point increase in expected total shareholder return.
These results are comparable in magnitude when compared to the intrinsic variability of
the performance measure considered.
