           HOW COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED THE    WAGE   STRUCTURE:
                  EVIDENCE FROM MICRODATA,    1984-89


                                 ABSTRACT


     This paper examines whether employees who use a computer at

work earn a higher wage rate than otherwise similar workers who

do not use a computer at work.      The analysis primarily relies on
data from the Current Population Survey and the High School and

Beyond Survey.     A   variety of statistical models are estimated to
try   to correct   for unobserved variables that might be correlated
with both job-related computer use and earnings.        The estimates
suggest that workers who use computers on their job earn roughly
a 10 to 15 percent higher wage rate.  In addition, the estimates

suggest that the expansion in computer use in the l980s can
account for between one-third and one-half of the observed

increase in the rate of return to education,        Finally,
occupations that experienced greater growth in computer use
between 1984 and 1989 also experienced above average wage growth.

         Several researchers have documented that    significant changes   in the

structure of wages took place in the United States in the 1980$.l          For

example, the rate of return to education increased markedly since 1979,

with     the   earnings advantage of college graduates relative to high school

graduates increasing from 38 percent in 1979 to 55 percent in 1989.          In

addition, wage differentials based on race have expanded while the male-

female wage gap has narrowed,      and the reward for experience appears to have

increased. These changes in the wage structure do not appear to be a

result of transitory cyclical factors.

       In contrast    to the near consensus   of opinion regarding the scope and

direction of changes in the wage structure in the 1980s,       the root causes of

these changes are more controversial, The two leading hypotheses that have

emerged to explain the rapid changes in the wage structure in the 1980s
are: (1) increased international competition in several industries has hurt

the economic position of low-skilled and less-educated workers in the U.S.

(e.g., Murphy and Welch, 1991);      (2) rapid,   skill-biased technological

change    in the 198Dm caused profound changes in the relative productivity of

various types of workers (e.g., 8ound and Johnson,       1989, Mincer, 1991, and

Allen,    1991).    Unfortunately, the evidence that has been used to test these

hypotheses has been mainly indirect, relying primarily on aggregate

industry-levelor time-series data.

       This paper explores the impact of the 'computer revolution" on the

wage structure using three microdata sets.        The 1980s witnessed

unprecedented growth in the amount and type of computer resources used at



     1Excellent examples of this literature include: Blackburn, Bloom, and
Freeman (1990), Murphy and Welch (1988), Katz and Revenga (1989), Katz and
Murphy (1991), Bound and Johnson (1989), Levy (1989), Mincer (1991), and
Davis and Haltiwanger (1991).
work,    and the cost of oompuring power fell dramatically over the deoade.

For example,    in   1984 fewer then 10 percent of establishments reported that


they had personal oomputers, while this figure was over 35 peroenr in 1989

(see Figure 1)        Berndt and Orilirhes (1990) estimate that the quality-

adjusted    real price of   new   microcomputers fell by   28   percent per year
between 1982    and 1988.    Several authors who have come to view technological

change as a promising explanation of changes in the wage structure have

highlighted the computer revolution as the prototypical example of such

rechno1ogcal change,2

        It is important to stress that the effect of technological change on

the relative earnings of samious categories of workers is theoretically

ambiguous.     The new computerzechnology may be a cozsplemene€or e substitute

with skilled workers.3       In the former case, the computer revolution       is


likely to lead to an expansion in earnings differentials based on skill,

and in the latter case it is likely to lead to compression in skill-based

differentials. This caper focuses on the narrow issue of whether employees

who use computers at wprk earn more as a result of applying their computer

skills,    and whether the premium for using     s   computer can account for much

of the changes in the wage structure, The analysis pris4arily uses data

from Current Pcpulstion Surveys (CPS) conducted in October of 1984 and

1989.     These surveys contain supplemental questions on computer use.             Since


     2For example, Bound end Johnson (1990) write that one explanation
"attributes wage structure changes to changes in technology, brought on in
large part by the computer revolution." They conclude that this
explanation "receives a great deal of support from the data."

manufacturing industries that suggest that skilled labor is a complement
with new technclcgy. For related evidence see Welch (1970) and Oriliches

CPS data spanning this time period wete widely used to document the trends

in wage diffetentials noted previously,          these dsts sets ste particularly


germane.    In addition to the CPS,    I    also examine data from the High School

and Beyond Survey (HSBS), which contains information on cognitive skills

and family background, as well as on computer use at work.

     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.          Section I

presents a brief descriptive analysis of the workers who use computers at

work and details trends in computer utillzation in the U.S. in the 1950s.

Section II seeks to answer the question:         Are workers who use computers at

work paid more ss a result of their computer skills?          Section III sddresses

issues of possible omitted variable bias,          Section IV anslyzes the impact

of computer use on other wage differentials, Finally,          Section V concludes

by speculating on the likely future course of the wage structure in light

of the new evidence regarding the payoff to computer use.

     To preview the main results       I    find that workers are rewarded more


highly if they use computers at work.         Indeed, workers who use a computer

earn roughly   lOlS percent higher pay than otherwise similar workers.

Although the analysis is by necessity nonexperimenral, I tentatively

conclude that a causal interpretationof the effect of computer use on

earnings may be appropriate. This conclusion is reached by fitting a

variety of models to adjust for nonrandom selection, and by controlling for

computer   use off the job.   I   further   find that because higher educated

workers are more likely to use computers at work, and because computer use

expanded tremendously throughout the lSBOa, computer use can account for a

substantial share of the increase      in the rate of return to education.

I,   Descriptive Apslysi

     In spite of     the wide sptead belief that computers have fundamentally

altered the wotk environment, little desctiptive information exists

concetning the chatacteristics of workers who use computers on the job.

Table   1   summarizes the probability of using a compurar at work for several

categories of workers in 1984 and 1989.        The rabularions are based on

October CPS data.     These surveys asked respondents whether rhey have

"direct or hands on use of computers" at work.4        Compurer use is broadly

defined, and includes programming, word processing, E-mail, computer-aided

design, etc.      For one-quarter of the sample, informarion on earnings was

also collected.

        Between 1984 and 1989 the percentage of workers who report using a

computer at work increased by over 50 percent,       from 24.6 ro   374   percent of

rhe work force.      Women,   csucssisns, and highly educated workers are more

likely to use computers at work than men, African Americans, and less-

educated workers.      Furthermore, rhe percentage gap in computer use between

these groups     grew between 1984 snd 1989.    For example,   in 1984 college

gradusces were 22 points more likely to use computers sr work than high

school graduates; In 1989 this differential was 29 points.

        Surprisingly, workers age 40-54 ste more likely ro use computers at

work than workers age 18-25, snd the growth in computer use between 1984

and 1989 was grestest for middle age workers.        A linear probability

regression of a computer-use dummy on experience and its square, education,

and demographic variables indicates that the likelihood of using s computer

    An establishment survey by the Gartner Group provides some additional

information on the diffusion of computers      among establishments, Figure       1


presents a graph of the percent of deskworkers (i.e.           white collar workers)

with PC's, and of the percent of establishments that have PC's, each year

from 1984-1989. Although this variable differs from the CPS measure of

computer use     a steady upward trend is apparent.

     The following table summarizes the relationship between the prevalence

of personal computers and establishment size, again using data from the

Gartner survey.       Except for very small establishments, computer use is not

strongly related to establishment size.       And the growth in personal

computers per worker between 1984 and 1989 is        riot   strongly related to

establishment size for establishments with more than 20 employees.

       I   have earimated   a variary of staristcal         models to     rry to   answer rhe

question: Do employees who         use compurers ar work raceive a higher wage rare

as a resulr of rbeir compurer skills?              I begin by summarizing some simple

ordinary least squares (OhS) estimates.              The analysis is based on data from

the October 1984 and 1989 CPS,             The sample consists of workers age 18-65.

(See Appendix     A for further details of the          sample.)

Notes:  Standard errors are shown in parentheses. Sample size is 13,335 for
1984 and 13379 for 1989.   Columns 2,3,5,and 6 also include 3        region dummy
variables,
(exp(.325)-i) in 1989.         In columns (2) and (5) several covariates are added

to the regression equation,        including   educatico,, potential experience and

its square,     gander,    and union status.      Including these variables reduces

the computer premium to 18.5 percent in 1984 and to 20.6 percent in 1989.

Even after including these covariates,            however,   the computer dummy variable

continues to have a aicable and statistically significant effect on wages,

with t-rarios of 21.3 in 1984 and 23.1 in 1989.

         It is nor ricer whether occupation dummies are appropriate variables

to include in these wage regressions because computer skills may enable

workers to qualify for jobs in higher paying occupations end industries.

For example,     one would probably not want to control for whether a worker is

in the computer programming occupation while estimating the effect of

computer use on earnings.         Nevertheless,     columns (3) and (6) include a set

of   8   one-digit occupation dummies.     These models still show a sizable pay

differential for using a computer at work.             In 1989,   for example,   employees

who use computers on the job earn 17.6 percent higher pay than employees

who do nor use computers on the job, holding education, occupation, and

other cherecterstics constant.          If 44 two-digit occupmtion dummies are

included in the model in column (6) instead of one-digit occupation

dummies,     the computer use wage differential is 13.9 percent, with e t-rario

of 15.5.


a.       Employer characteristics

         Although   I   em mainly concerned about bias because of omitted employee

characteristics that etc correlated with computer use at work,              it is

possible that characteristics of employers            are correlated with the


provision of computers and the generosity of compensation. Such a
relationship might exist in a rent-sharing model        in which employees are

able to capture some of the retutn to the employer's capital stock.

Unfortunately there is only a limited amount of informatiun about employer

characteristics in the CFS.      However,   if 48 two-digit industry dummies are

included in a model that includes     two-digit occupation dummies and the

covatiates in column (6), the compoter use wage diffetential is 11.4

percent,   with a t-ratio of l3.O.

     Information on employer size is not available in the October CPS, but

two findings soggest that the computer differential is not merely

reflecting the effect of (omitted) employer size.       First, establishment-

level surveys do not show a strong relationship between computer use and

establishment size (e.g., Hitschorn, 1991).       Second,   in a recent paper

Reilly (1990) uses a sample of 607 employees who worked in 60

establishments in Canada in 1979 to investigate the relationship between

establishment size and wages.      Reilly estimates wage regressions including

a dwmsy variable indicating access to a computer. Without controlling for

establishment size, ha finds that employees who have access to a computer

earn 15.5 percent (t—S.7) higher pay.       When he includes the log of

establishment size the computer-wage differential is 13.4 percent (t—3.9).

     Finally,   I   have estimated the model in column (5) separately for union

and nonunion workers.      The premium for computer use is 20.4 percent

(t-rario—23) in the nonunion sector, and just 7.8 percent (t—4.3) in the

union sector.       Since unions have been found to compress skill differentials

(see Lewis, 1986 and Card, 1991), this finding should not be surprising.


     5Results for 1984 are similar: the wage differential falls to 11.3
percent if 44 occupation dummies are included, and to 9.0 percent if 48
two-digit industry dummies are included.
However,    if one believed that the premium for work-related Computer use is

a result of employees oapturing firms' oaptal rents rather than a return

to a skill,    it is diifioult to explain why the premium is so muoh larger in

the nonunion seotor than in the union seotor.


                              Time

        The results in Table 2 indioate   that, if anything,   the estimated

reward for using a oomputer at work inoreased slightly between 1984 and

1989.     got example,   based on the models in oolumns (3) and (6), between

1984 and 1989 the oomputer (log) wage premium inoreased        by   .022.   The

standard error of this estimate is .011, so the inorease        is on the margin

of statistioal signifioanoe. There is oertainiy no evidenoe of a deoline

in the payoff for oomputer skills in this period,

        This finding is of interest for two reasons.      First, given the

substantial expansion in the supply of workers who have coaputer skills

between 1984 and 1989 one might have expeoted a deoline in the wage

differential assooiated with Computer use at work, oeteris paribus.           The

failure of the wage differeotial for oomputer use to deoline suggests that

the demand for workers with oomputer skills may have shifted out as fast

as,   or faster   than, the outward shift in the supply    of oomputer-literate

workers.     This hypothesis is plausible givem the remarkable deoline in the

prioe of Computers and the expansion in uses of oomputers in the 1980s.

        A seoondreason why the slight     inorease   in the wage differential

assoofated with oomputer use is of interest oonoerns the effeot of possible

nonrandom seleotion of the workers who use Computers. Companies are likely

to provide Computer training and equipment first to the workers whose

produotivity is expeoted to inorease the most from using a Computer.              This
                                                      10

would pose a problem for the interpretation of the Ohs estimates if these

workers would have earned higher wages                 in   the absence   of    computer   use,   The

large     increase in the number of workers who used coeputers at work between

1984 and 1989 was iiaely to have reduced the average quality of workers who

work with computers,        wnich would be expected to drive down the average wage

differential associated with computer use.                   However, the slight increase in

the computer wage premium between 1984 and 1989 suggests that nonrandom

selection of the workers who use computers is not the dominant factor

behind the positive association between computer use and wages.

        The other variables in Table           2   generally have their typical effects on

wages, and their coefficients are relatively stable between 1984 and 1989.

One notable exception is the rate of return to education, which increased

by   ,g   percentage points between 1984 and 1989, even after holding computer
use constant.        And the black-white wage gap increased while the wage gap

between whites and other races declined in these years.



c.    Sperifir      compurer tasks

        The 1989 CPS asked workers what tasks they use their computer for.

Individuals were allowed to indicate multiple tasks.                      I   have estimated the

model in column 6 of Table            2   including    a set of computer-task dummy

variables. (These estimates are available on request.)                          Interestingly,

rhese     results    show that   me    most highly rewarded task computers are used

for is electronic mail, probably reflecting the fact that high-ranking

executives often use E-mail,              On the other hand,      these       results   show no

premium for lndivdoals who use a computer for playing computer games.                             And

book keeping, desk top publishing, and inventory control have slightly
lower rewards than the average task.




III.    Is the Computer Wage Differential Real or Illusory?

       A critical concern in interpreting the              OLI regressions reported above

is that workers who use computers on the job may                be more able   workers,   and

therefore    may have earned higher wages even in the absence of computer

technology.     Further,        the finding that the computer-wage differential is

attenuated when covariates are included in the OLS regressions suggests

that important variables may be omitted that are positively correlated with

both computer use and earnings.                I have tried four empirical strategies to

probe whether the computer-pay differential is a real consequence of

coaputer use or is spurious.


a.     Computer use at home and work

        The 1984 and 1989 October CPS surveys collected information on

computer use at home as well as at work.                 This enables a more general

specification of the wage equation.                 In particular, I have estimated

parameters of the following log-wage equation:


            ln W —
                               Cwel + Chn2 +
                     xfi   +                              + C
(2)                                            CCha3

where                  variable           that equals one if a worker uses a computer
         tw is a dummy
at work and zero otherwise, Ch                 is   a dummy variable that equals one if a

worker uses a computer at home and zero otherwise, and                  wh
                                                                        C 'C    is an

interaction between            computer use    at home and at   work.

        To some extent, workers who possess unobserved              characteristics that
are    associated with           at home may be selected by employers to
                               computer use
use computers at work on the baste of those same characteristics. In this
                                                      12

case       controlling for whether workers use a computer at home would capture

at least some of the unobserved variance in the error term that is

cortelared with tunpurer ,se at work.                    If the positive association between

computer use at wotk and nay is spuriously reflecting correlation between

computet use and omitted variables we would expect 01                                  —
                                                                             02 and 01
           Table   3    presents OIS estimates of equation (2) using CFS data for 1984

and 1989.          The results suggest that computer use at work is the main

determinant of earnings,            not computer use generally. For example,             in 1989

individuals who used a computer                      wqxkonl' earned approximately 17.7

percent mote pet hour than those who did not use a computer at all, whereas

individuals who used a computer at               hnsie     only earned 7 percent mote than

those who did not ume a computer at                  alL6 On the other      hand,   individuals

who used a computer at home and at work earned about                   9   percent mote than
individuals who used a computer at work only.                    Similar results hold for 1984.


            isa res for     nammcv cc cc a t ion s

           As a   second approach, I limit the         OPS sample to homogeneous groups of

workers,          The   largest narrowly-defined occupational group in the CPS is
secretaries -           In 1984 some 46 percent of secretaries used computers at
work; by 1989           this figure rose to 77 percent. Not surprisingly, three-
quartets      of    the secretaries who report using computers             on their job use

computers for word processing. Table 4 contains                    estimates of wage

regressions for samples of secretaries in 1984 and 1989.                     The wage premium

for secreraries who use computers on the job is 6 percent (r—2,5)                      in 1984

and    9   percenr (t—3.l) in 1989,          If the sample is further restricted to


        6The effect of home computer use on pay may be biased upwards because
some individuals say use computers    at home for work-related tasks,

secretaries with exactly a high school education, the wage premiums is 9.2

percent (t—33) in 1984 and 8.6 percent (t—21) in 1989.

     The large premium secretaries appear to receive for using a
                                                                 computer

                                                            employers place
on computer   skills.     First,   I   conducted a small phone survey of temporary

employment agencies in New York City             San Francisco, Cleveland, and Dallas,

and asked several questions concerning the computer use and
                                                            pay of the
secretaries they place.       141 temporary       agencies were contacted, and    at

least partial responses were received from 83 (58.9 percent) agencies.7

Interestingly, 84 percent of surveyed firms currently give job applicants a

written or hands-on test of computer skills.            One of the questions we asked

the placement firms was:      "In your experience,      are employers willing to pay

secretaries more if they have computer skills than if they don't have

computer skills?"       Ninety-eight percent of agencies responded yes.

     We also asked the placement firms: "What is the typical
                                                             hourly pay
rate a secretary is paid who does not have computer skills?",            and "What is

the typical hourly pay rate a secretary is paid who is otherwise identical

but does have computer skills?" The mean hourly rate for a secretary with

computer skills was $12.77 (std. error —$0.43), and the mean hourly rate

for a secretary without computer skills was $9.14 (std. error —            $0.25).
The difference in the mean log wage for computer vs. noncomputer use in

this sample is .33 (std.     error —      02),   which is much greater than the

estimated log-wage differential for computer use derIved for secretaries


     7Employment agencies in the survey were selected from the yellow pages
of the phone books for these four cities. The survey was conducted in
August 1991, and the questions were addressed to "someone who is
knowledgeable about placement." More information on the sample frame and
questionnaire is available on request.

using CPS data,

     Lastly,   we asked the employment agencies whether they provide computer

training to the workers they place, and who pays for the training                 Some 62

percent of employment agencies responded that they provide up-front

training for the workers they place.         And in 96 percent of the instances        in

which training is provided       the employment agency pays for the training.

In the remaining 4 percent the employee pays for training;          none of the

firms responded that the firm where the worker is placed pays for training.

The finding that employment agencies pay for computer training for

temporary employees is quite surprising because the training is likely to

be of general use.    Moreover, this phenomenon differs from on-the-job

training since temporary workers cannot pay for training by taking a lower

initial wage because they receive        the training before they start work, and

they are under no obligation to subsequently work.          The fact that temporary

agencies seem to find it profitable to provide computer training to the

workers they place suggests      there   is a substantial return to computer skills.

     Second,   a survey of 507 secretaries employed by large firms conducted

by Kelly Services    (1984, p. 13) provides some additional evidence         on
whether employers truly pay a wage premium to secretaties with computer

skills. This survey found that 30 percent of secretaries received a pay

raise as a result of obtaining word processing skills.

     Although the estimated wage premium for secretaries who use computers

at work based on CPS data may appear to be large by economic standards

(e.g., at least   as important   as one year of additional schooling), it does

not seem implausible given this external evidence.          In fact, the phone

survey of temporary employment agencies       suggests   that the CI'S may
underestimate the premium for computer use.     From a practical perspective,

the large wage differential for secretaries who are ptoficent at operating

computers suggests that public-sector training programs might profitably

concentrate on providing trainees with computer skills.

       I have estimated the computer wage differential for six additional
                        8
white collar occupations.     To summarize these results    the estimated

computer differential (a) and standard error for these occupations in 1989

are:   .137 (.035) for managers;   .101 (.044) for registered nurses; .060


(.038) for school teachers;    .185 (.046) for sales   supervisors;   -   .052   (.073)

for sales representatives; and .089 (.062) for book keepers.      Further

analysis indicates that the computer premium mends to be smaller in thtee-

digit occupations that have a greater proportion of wctkers using

computers.


c.     Remested cross-section methods

       Thus far, we have treated the 085 data sets as independent cross-

sections.     We can also take advantage of the repeated nature of the 085

data sets by linking cohorts over time.     Specifically, write the wage

equations for 1984 (indicated by subscript I) and for 1989 (indicated by

subscript 2) as:


(3)         in W.1       + CilOl +   cii

 (4)        In W,. —     + 0il°2 +



      8The occupations were selected on the basis of sample size: three-
digit occupations wfth 180 or more observations were selected.   (Elementary
school, secondary school, and special education teachers were combined.)
The regressions included the same variables as in column (5) of Table 2.
See Appendix A for further details.

and 1989, we can estimate the computer-use wage differential using repeated

cross-section/multiple cohort models.9 This estimator takes advantage of

the fact that the proliferation in computer use was not constant across

cohorts.     Because the same set of indivLduals are in thesecohorts over

time (ruling out labor force participation issues)                    computer use is not

correlated with unobservables at the cohort level,                    In principle, this

approach yields a consistent estimate of a even if    and                          are correlated.

      Specifically, define               (j—l929             1959)   as a set of cohort dummy

variables    that equal one if an individual is born in year                j   and zero

otherwise, and define Ti as a period dummy variable that equals one if an

individual is observed i0 1989 and zero if observed in 1984,                       Under the

assumptions listed above, we can estimate the following equation for a

pooled sample of individuals drawn from the 1984 and 1989 October CPS's:

Sume birth cohorts clesrly experieoced greater expansion in computer ose

than others,     Further,    the scatter diagram displays an opward sloping

relarionshtp between earnings growth and the growth in computer use for

these birth cohorts.        However, the upward sloping relationship exhibited   in

the figure is largely a result of slower wage growth icr older workers,

Equation (5) Includes a set of unrestricted cohort dummies and a year dummy

to control for differences in age.

        Table 5 reports estimates of equation (5).     The sample has been

narrowed to individuals born between 1929 and 1959 to avoid major

life-cycle changes in labor force participation. The model in column (1)

simply reports the Ohs estimate of equation 5.        Columns (2) and (3)

identify the computer differential from cohort variation in the growth in

oompurer use between 1984 and 1989.       Notice that the models differ insofar

as which of the X-vmriables are free to have varying coefficients over

time,    The model in column (2) is the least restrictive specification: all

of the X-variables are allowed to have time-varying coefficients, but the

cohort dummies and computer dummy are restrIcted to have constant effects

over time.    Column (3) only frees up the gender, race, and education

variables over time,

        The TSLS models in columns (2) and (3), which rely on the repeated

cross-sections for identification, show that the wage differential for

using a computer on the job is about 29 percent,      about twice as large as

their standard errors.       Although the TSLS estimate is larger than the OhS

estimate,    the difference between them is not statistically significant.

However,    both 2SLS models fail a test of error-instrument orthogonality at

conventional levels of significance.       Futhermore, the estimates are

 extremely sensitive to minor changes in the specification. For example                    if

 experience and experience-squared are included instead of the 30 cohort

 duacies,      the computer (log) wage differential increases        to   045    (t—48).

 d.   Estimates      based on the Rich Srhool and Beyond Survey

      To    control for a more comprehensive sot of personol characteristics, I

have examined data from the High School and Beyond                        This
                                                   Survey.

 longitudinal data act contains information on comparer use, achievement

test scores, and school performance for individuals who were high school

sophomores or seniors in 1980.               The 1984 wave of the survey asked about

earnings       and work experience.      I   restrict the sample to workers with

exactly a high school education because anyone with additional schooling

would   riot   have spent much time in the labor market by 1984.             Further

description of the sample and variables is provided in Appendix B.

      Unfortunately,       the computer use question in the HSBS is not ideally

suited for my purposes.         Information on computer use at work was collected

only in the 1984 wave of the survey.              In that year, individuals were asked

whether they ever used a computer on a job.               Some individuala may have used

a computer on an earlier job but not on their present job.                Consequently,

computer use and earnings are not perfectly aligned.               Nevertheleaa, the
USES provides another data aet with which to examine the robuatneaa of the

effect of computer utilization at work on earnings.

      Table     6   presents several OLS estimates of the effect of computer use

at work    on wages using the    USgS.        The first column simply reports the

difference in the mean log wage rate in 1984 for workers who have used a

computer at work and those who have not.               The differential of    11 log

points is lower than the estioare derived from the October 1984 CFS.

Column (2) adds several demographic variables, column (3) adds several

variables measuring the kind of high school the individual attended, and

column (4) adds the worker's self-reported high schuol grado puirit average,

a composite test score measuring reading and mathematics skills,          aid

additional background characteristics (eg ,          parents'   education),

Including these variables has little effect on the magnitude of the wage

premium for work-related computer use.

     Interestingly, in the HSBS data there is a statistically significant,

positive association between a worker's propensity to use a computer at

work and both his achievement test score and grade point averege.             For

example,   a one standard deviation increase       in the cognitive test measure is

associated with a 2.7 percentage point increase         in the likelihood of

computer use at work,11 A possible concern about the estimates in colwn

(4) is that the test score variable     has a negative effect on earnings, Tu

explore this further,   in other estimates     I   have used workers' 1982

achievement test score, which is available otly for sophomores, as an

instrumental variable for their 1980 test score.         However, these estimates

continue to show a negative relationshipbetween achievement test scores

and wages,

     The 1984 wave of the HSBS also inquired about individuals'

"recreational"use of computers; that is, whether they have used a cuo.putcr

outside of work and school.    I   have used this infurmation to est,,mace

equation (2) for the Hill sample, where "home" computer use denotes



     11The association between "recreational"computer use (i.e , computer
use that is unrelated to work or school) and test scores is even higb'c'.
For example, a one standard deviation increase in the test score taises
probability of recreational computer uae by 9.6 percentage points.
                                              20

"recreational'         use,   These results are reported in column (5).   Similar to

the   estimates from the OPS, the results indicate         that computer use at work

is    an   important    determinant of earnings, whereas computer use at home does

not aignficantly affect earnings.



IV. The Effect of the Commuter Revolution           o   Other Wage   Dijjp,isls
       The       previous sections  tentatively establish that workers who use
computers on          their jobs earn more as a result of their computer skills.     A

natural         question to raise is:   thfl.sffecthas the proliferatio,,st

c2p2Mters..Eatk1.Qn...therelatjpnship between earnings and ojg.
variables, auth as education? This issue is particularly relevant because

computer use, and the expansion of computer use, has not been uniform

across       groups.     Here I only estimate the direct effect of holding computer

use constant on other earnings differentials;            potentially important spill

over effects of computer use on non-computer users (e.g., the effect of a

secretary using a computer on his or her boss) are not taken into account.

           To explore the effect of computer use on other wage differentials,
                                                                                and
Table       7   presents OLS estimates of wage equations in 1984 and 1989, with

without including the computer use dummy variable.             Columns (2) and (5)

simply reproduce estimates in Table          2.    Columns (3) and (6) teport an

alterative specification, which includes both a computer dummy and an

interactionbetween the computer dummy and years of education. This

specification indicates          that the computer differential is greater for more

highly educated workers.

           Notably,    the table shows that the rate of return to education

 increased        by one point between 1984 and 1969 if the computer dummy is not

included    in the regressions; if the computer dummy iS included the return

to sducstion increased by 0.6 points.     To further investigate the    time-

series trend in the return to education,      Figure 3 plots estimates of the

return to education for the full sample and for three subsamples, based on

dets from the Outgoing Rotation Group (OGRG) Files of the CPS each ymet

from 1979l99O.l2     The figure indicates that the log-linear estimate of the

return to education increased steadily between 1979-1988, although the

upward tend appears to have levelled off in 1989-90.

     I   have examined the effect of computer use on the retutn to education

In several other samples.    These results ate summarized in Tables 6 and        9.

First consider Table 8, which reports estimates of the rate of return to

education (times 100), with and without including a dummy indicating

computer use at work.    The first subsample is private sector wockets)3

8etween October 1984 and 1989 the conventional 01.5 estimate of the return

to education in the private sector incteesed by .96 points.        If, however,

computer use is held constant,    the return to education is estimated to have

increased by .56 points. Thus, it appears that increased computer use can

"account"   for 41.6 percent (—   100•(.96-.56)/.96) of   the increase in the

return to education in the private sector.

     Turning to the other samples,    the return to education increased    by
less fot women than for men between 1984 and 1989.        Holding computer use

constant accounts fot over half the increase in the return to education


     12The sample and covariates were defined to be similar to the samples
used in column (1) of Table 7. Further details are available on request.

     13Katz ond Krueger (1991) find that the increase in the return to
education was much greater for private sector workers than for public
sector workers.

observed fat female              workers,   and nearly 40 percent for male workers.                   Also?

it appears that although the return to education increased by more for


younger wotkets than for older workers, controlling for computer use

accounts for a larger share of the increase                    for older workers.

      Table 9 reports results with and without including both a computer use

dummy and an interaction between computer use and years of education.

Specifically,         I   estimate the equation:


(6)        In   W         Xifi
                                 +   Ep   ÷ P.o +   C.E.1 + c.

where In W. represents the log hourly wage rate,                         education, C. a

computer use dummy variable,                 and      a set of covariates. I am interested

in the question:             What would the return to education be if computer use

remained constant at its 1984 level?                     This is given by         p +   q..266   ,   where

.246 is the proportion of workers that used computers in 1984.

      Because    -y       > 0 for most      subsamples    and has increased over time (compare

columns (3) and (6) of Table 7), the specification that includes the

interaction between the computer use dummy and education tends to account

for a somewhat greater share of the increase                     in the return to education.

Fur example,        the augmented specificationaccounts for 50.5 percent of the

increase    in the return to education for the entire sample, and neatly two-

thirds of the inctease for private sector workers.                           For women,    increases in

computer use appear to account for more than the total obsecved increase in

the return to education. For older workers,                      however,        the wage differential

for using a computer declines with education                     (y <   0)   ,   so more of the

increase    in the return to education for this sample is accounted for by

computer use in the duassy variable specification in Table 8.

        To summarize the estimates from                        these    twa specifications, it would

appear that the increase in computer use can account for between one-third

and one-half of the increase in the return to education between 1984 and

1989.     Even the lower bound suggests                        that the proliferation of computers at

work may be an important component of the increase in the return to

education.


a.     Occupational wage structure

        Lastly,    I   examine how the growth in computer use has affected the

occupational wage structure. Specifically,                               I   used the 1984 and 1989

October CFS's to calculate                       the proportion        of workers who use a computer at

work for 485 three-digit occupations, and I used the 1984 and 1989 outgoing

rotation group files of the CPS to calculate the mean log wage for the same

set    of occupations.               t    then regressed the change in mean log wage an the

change    in   computer     use,            The   coefficient        estimates, with standard errors in

parentheses, are as follows:


 (7)               lnJ           —        .152     +    .105    C                  —   03
                                         (.004)        (.029)

where    tln11.   is the growth in mean log hourly earnings in occupation                              ,j   and
is the    growth       itt the   proportion of workers who use computers at work in

occupation J.          The equation was estimated by weighted least                         squares,        using

the number     of workers                in occupation j        in 1989      as weights.    These results

indicate that computer growth is positively associated with wage growth in

an occupation.

V.   Conclusion

      This paper presenrs a derailed investigation of whether employees who

use computers at work earn a higher wage as a consequence of their hendo-on

compurer   use..    A variety of   estimates     suggesr that employees who directly

use a computer at work earn a 10 to 15 percent higher wage rare.

Furthermore, because more highly educated workers are more likely to use

compurers on rhe job, rhe estimates            imply that the proliferation of

computers   car,   account for between one-rhrd and one-half of the increase             in

the rate of return to education observed between l9g4 and 1969.               Although

it is unlikely thet a single explanation ran adequately account for all the

wage structure changes that occurred in the 1980a, these results provide

support for the view that technological change -- and in particular the

spread of computers at work        -   - has   significantly contributed to recent

changes in the wage structure.

      One frequent objection to the conclusion that the computer revolution

is   an important cause of recent         changes     in the wage structure is made by

Blmckburn, Bloom, and Freeman (1991): "U.s. productivity during the 1990s

showed only sluggish growth, not the rapid advance one might expect if

technological change were the chief cause of the changing structure of

wages.     Although there may be some merit to this view, there are two

reasons to question its importance.             First, Griliohes and Seigel    (1991)

find a positive relationship between total factor productivity growth and

the prevalence of computers among industries.

       Second,     technological change may cause changes in the dstributon of

earnings without a dramatic effect on aggregate productivity growth or

aggregate wage growth.       For example,       suppose the advent of computers has
                                          25

increased the productivity of workers who use them by 10-15 percent,            but

has not changed the productivity of other workers at all.        And suppose that

the computer premium is a return to general human capital.        flecause roughly

35 percent    of workers directly use a   computer   on the job, we would only

expect wage growth of 3.5 to 5.3 percent from the spread of computers.

Furthermore, since the growth in computers wss gradual over a perrud of at

least    a decade, the annual increment to aggregate productivity and income

due to computers could easily be masked by other factors.

        An important question   is whether the wage structure changes observed

in the last decade will persist in the future.        The estimates in this paper

suggest that, at least io part,     the evolution of the wage structure is tied

ro future developmeots in technology.      In the five years between 1984 and

1989 there was neatly a 50 percent increase      in the percentage of workers

who use computers on rhe job, yet the estimated payoff to using a computer

at work did nor fall.     An obvious explanation for    this finding is rhar

employers' demand for computer-literateworkers increased even faster than

the supply of such workers in the 1980s.       On the other hand, a measure of

caution should probably be used In interpreting these results in terms of

shifts   of both supply and demand curves because,     with only two

observations, movements in both supply and demand are capable of explaining

any observed pattern of changes in prices and quantities

     Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to speculate rhat the supply of

workers who are proficenr at operating computers        is likely to continue to

demand for computer-literate workers will continue to expand as rapidly as

it has in the past decade.       If   these conjectures hold,   one would   expect
that   the wage differential for using a computer at work will fall in the

future.   On the other   hand,    there   is little evidence that the value of


computer skills has declined in recent years.         Thus,   computer training may,

at least in the short run,       be a profitable investment for public and

private job training programs.

     The   CI'S   data uaed in Table      I   ate ftom all totation gtoups of tha

October 1984 and 1989 UPS.          The   CI'S   data used in the test of the paper ate

limited to the outgoing rotation groups because only these individuals are

asked about their weekly wage.            The sample is further restricted to

                                                                    were
individuals between age 16 and ii who were working or had a job but

not at work.       The "usual hourly wage" is the ratio of usual weekly earnings

to usual weekly hours.         Individuals who earned less than $1.50 per hour or

more than $250.00 per hour are deleted from the sample.

     The weekly wage variable in the 1984                 CI'S   is top coded at $999, whereas

the weekly wage      in   the 1989 survey is top coded at $1,923.                To make the

wage variables comparable over time,              I   calculated an estimate of the mean

                                                     1984 as follows.                        I

topcoded in the 1984        CI'S.   If the shape of the wage distribution remained

     The "uses computer at work" dummy equals one if the employee

currently   married.   The "pert-time" dummy variable equals one if the worker

usually wotks less than 35 houts per week.      "Potential experience" is age

minus education minus 6.

     The wage data used to estimate equation (7) are from all outgoing

rotation groups of the 1984 and 1989 OPS files.     Computer utlizarion for

three-digit occupations is derived from all rorarion groups of the 1984 and

1989 October 085 files.

               Appendix 5:   flush   School and Seyond Survey Sample

       The High School and Seyond Survey consists        of a base-year survey

conducted in 1960, and follow-up waves conducted in 1982, 1984 and 1986,

The sample used here consists of individuals who were sophomores or seniors

in 1980 and who graduated from high       school   by   1986, but did nor receive any

additional education. The sample is further restricted to individuals who

responded to all waves of the survey. were employed in 1984, earned between

$1.50 and $100.00 per hour, and had valid responses to the computer use

questions, Many of the variables used in the analysis,           such as race and

sex,   are defined in a standard fashion and are not described here.         For a

detailed description of the HSBS, including the sample design,

questionnaire, and tabulations of variables, see Sebring,          et al. (1987).

       The variable "used computer at work" is derived from the 1984 survey

wave.    If the worker reports ever having used a computer at work, he or she

is assigned a one for the computer use dummy variable.           Computer use may

involve using a microcomputer, minicomputer, or mainframe computer.           The

variable defined as "used computer at home" equals one if the worker used a

computer terminal microcomputer, minicomputer, or mainframe computer for

"recreational" purposes (i.e., nonwork and nonschool related use).

       The hourly wags rate pertains to the worker's current job as of l98,

and is derived from the reported pay schedule and reported weekly hours,

The variable called "Senior in 1980" equals one for individuals who          w,'re


high school seniors in 1980, and zero for individuals who were sophomores

in 1980.    The variable called "union member" indicates whether the worker

was a member or active participant in a union, farm, trade or professional

association in 1985 or 1986.         There are three categories of high school
                                                30


types in the survey; general,         academic,      and vncarinnal. Vocatinnal high

schools are the omitted dummy category.               "Utban" measures whether the

worker attended a school in an urban atea.

     Patent's   education consists of       5   dummy vatah1es for the mnther and

for tho fathet,    indicating whether each patent's education is missing,             high

school,   some college,    college,    or post college.      <Less than high school is

the base group.)     In ipso all      students were given a 73 minute cognitive

test of vocabulary, readtng,      and mathematics.         The students' score on the

1982 test is the variable called "achievement test score'.              The sophomores

were given a similar test again in 1982.               "Grade point average" is the

student's self-reported grade point average in 1982.               "Disciplinary

problem" is a   dum.'sy   variable that indicates whether a student reports

having had a disciplinary problem in high school in rhe last year.

"Disability limits work" is a dummy variable that equals one if a student

reports having a physical disability that limits the             kind or amount of work

that ha or abe can do on a job, or that effects his or her chances for more

eduction.
