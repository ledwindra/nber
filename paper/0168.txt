—2—

it increasingly difficult to discriminate in the form of differential pecuniary

wages. Employers would raise the observed wage for blacks while at the same
time decreasing the unobserved (or more difficult to observe) human capital

component and thereby keep the true differential constant. Since most government programs concentrate on entry level job discrimination, and since differential on—the—job training does not show up until later, examinIng the pecuniary

wage rate for young workers may greatly distort the true wealth differential.
Indeed, almost any conceivable model of optimal law evasion would suggest that
employers would respond to legislation requiring equal pecuniary wage rates
across non—whites and whites at least in part by altering non—pecuniary aspects

of the wage. On—the—job training is, at least for young workers, a large part
of the non—pecuniary component. Both Welch and Freeman would miss this by
their techniques. Indeed, this may help explain why Freeman finds a narrowing
of the differential for young workers that is absent among older cohorts.

Since older workers have flatter profiles, there is less room to take back in

wage growth what has been given in pecuniary wage levels. Employer resistance to
elimination of pecuniary differentials is likely to be greater with respect to
older workers.
This paper will employ a method (devised in Lazear (1976) )

to

estimate

the unobserved component of wages. The size of this component will be calculated
for non—whites and whites separately and then compared. Since, as it turns out,
the component is larger for whites than non—whites, observed wage differentials

understate true differentials. Furthermore, comparison of the period between
1966—1969 with the 1972—1974 period reveals that this unobserved differential

Theory8

and

evidence tell us that investment in human capital,

in the form of forxnai. schooling and on—the—job training, is larger for

younger individuals than it

is

for older ones. Age—earnings profiles are

generally observed to be steeper in the early part of life so that f'(t)
is

a decreasing function of

(t) .

Therefore differences between measured

wages and "true" wages are likely to be greatest during the first years of
work

experience. For this reason, the two data sets to be used provide

information exclusively on young individuals. The 1966—1969 period is
analyzed with the use of the National Longitudinal Survey on Young Hen,

14—24 years of age in 1966. The 1972—1974 period makes use of the National

Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of l92. The first part of
this section will be devoted to examination of the 1966—1969 NLS. In the
second part we will compare results from this earlier period to those
obtained for the later 1972—1974 period.

One point should be made. The t in equations (1) through (4) refers

to experience time rather than chronological time. That is the f'(t) that
is relevant is that wage growth which occurs as the result of job experience

per se. It is only this component of growth that can be couited as part of

The interpretation of these coefficients is provided elsewhere [see Lazear (1976)1.

Basically, they suggest that positive changes in the stock of human capital

positively affect wage growth. Thus, the coefficient on tS (changes In the
stock of schooling) is positive and substantial. For the mean individual,

The measured wage differential between white and non—white young men in 1966

was $2.14 — $1.56 = $.58

.

The estimate of the true wage differential, on

the other hand, is a much larger $423 — $2.84 = $1.39.

Even in relative

terms, the ratio of white to non—white observed wages is 1.37. The ratio
of white to non—white true wages is 1.48. Thus, neglecting the value of
different experience—earnings profiles between whites and non—whites leads to

serious understatement of true wage differntia1s.

—11—

Even the above calculation is likely to understate the true differential
for two reasons, both of which have to do with differences in labor force

behavior between whites and non—whites. First, since whites are less likely
to suffer unemployment than are non—whites and since they typically retire at

a later date° the time period over which (12), (14), and (16) are integrated

should be longer for whites. Thus, the assumption that T —

t

45 for all

individuals is likely to cause the estimate of the value of wage growth for
whites relative to non—whites to be understated.
Second, since in any given year a white worker is more likely to be

employed than a non—white worker (once he begins full—time participation

in the labor force) (t)I1 and

earnings. (This is simply the

of the diminishing marginal rate of substitution between leisure and

goods as leisure increases). The amount by whIch it is smaller depends upon
the utility function itself. Without information on the parameters of that
function it is impossible to choose correct weights for white vs. non—white

wages. This notwithstanding, the estimates of wage differentials obtained
above are lower bounds to the true differentials since both of those labor
force participation effects work in the direction of increasing the true
differential.

—12—

2. Decomposition of wage growth

It is useful to consider the individual components of the unobserved wage

differential. From (11), it is clear that differences in

w69

between whites

and non—whites result either from differences in the average wage levels across

groups (i.e.,

W66[exp(80

+ ....+

W69) or from differences in the

effect of experience itself on growth rates (i.e., 86+ 88TJ69

+

312S66+ 13D)

it turns out, the most important determinant of differences in wage growth is
the grade of schooling completed, S66 .

This variable operates in three ways.

First, it causes there to be differences in the initial wage level, W66, since

is itself dependent upon schooling level. Second, changes in S66 affect
the difference between

and

since W69 W66 exp (Bo+.. .+811S66+812S6E
S66 affect the degree to which job

experience affects wage growth since S66 interacts with LE in the wage
growth equation. Let us consider each in turn.
One cannot infer directly the effect of schooling on the wage level in 1966 from

eq. (9). However, elsewhere (Lazear [19761) an analogous wage level equation
was estimated for the NLS young men. There, it was found that

one obtains that exp(80 +

negative effect of increased schooling through 811 exceeds the positive

effect of 812E .)
Third, and most important, is that the effect of job experience itself

depends upon schooling level. Adjusting this for the higher level of

schooling yields (86 + 88U69 + 812S66) = .0795

For whites, the proportion was .243.

It should be noted that the coefficient on D(E) for this early period
is close to zero. The differential experience—induced wage growth between
whites and non—whites during this early period is the result of differences

In initial conditions. This is not the case in the later period analyzed

below. There, the coefficient a D(EXE) is large and positive. Other things
constant, whites enjoy larger experience—induced wage growth than do nonwhites in 1972—1974 although this is not true during the early period.

—15—

A final

point

on white—non—white differences in wage growth are in order.

Despite all that has been said above, it is not the case that during 1966—1969

white young men's wages grew at a more rapid rate than that for non—white

young meti.

On the contrary,

This difference is reflected in the coefficient on D which is negative,

although insignificant. This is quite consistent with the scenario outlined above. If firms have responded to government pressure to reduce white —

non—white wage differentials by reducing the wage growth component for non—
ybites relative to whites, initial observed wages will rise relatively for

non—whites. That is, since the group in question consists of young men who
are predominantly at entry level jobs, pecuniary wages of non—whites will

rise on these jobs at a more rapid rate for non—whites than whites. This
is reflected in the negative coefficient on D. Yet once those initial jobs
are obtained, non—whites' experience will have a differential effect on wage

The question then is, do the coefficients of primary interest with

respect to f', namely 86 8' 8I2 and l3' differ significantly across years.
To test this, theestimates of these coefficients obtained from eq. (9) were
jnserted into the 1966—68 and 1966—67 equations. Then after constraining the
coefficients to take on these values, the regressions were rerun and the

of

squared residuals were compared to those obtained in the unconstrained

versions. For 1966—68, it was found that F(4,904)

Given that some of these individuals are currently enrolled in school,

it is interesting to perform the analysis on non—students. Eq. (5) was

therefore rerun, deleting the S and ST terms on the non—student subsample.

as expected. However, the primary findings remained the same: (l966) 'Dl = $4.46

wage rates were f(1966)IDl — $2.65 and f(1966)ID...0 = $1.74 so that the
observed differential was 9l per hour.
B. The NLS High School Class of 1972:

1. Estimation
In this section, longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal
Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLSHS) will be used to estimate
the unobserved on—the—job training component of earnings during this

later period. This sample, although similar to the NLS for 1966—1969,

has some important differences. The major difference is that all individuals in this sample were enrolled in twelfth grade in 1972 so no early

high school drop—outs are contained. This also implies that the age
distribution of respondents is much more tightly centered around the
mean age in 1972 than was the 1966—1969 sample (although the difference

in mean ages is not that substantial). Furthermore, there is virtually
no variation in initial schooling levels during October, 1972, the date

of the initial wage rate. These differences imply slight differences in
the forms of the wage growth equation (obvious ones are deletion of

initial

schooling and age variables), but the basic form is the same.

The NLSHS is a national probability sample of about 22,000 high

school seniors. A survey was taken during the Spring of 1972 and two
follow—ups were conducted in October of 1973 and 1974. For the purposes
of this analysis, a sub—sample of males who had wage rates reported and

-18-

complete information on the other relevant variables was

s2lected. (2393 individuals fit this category.) The basic estimating
equation for this period was:

What is important to note is that although there was virtually no wage differential
observed (whites earned on average $2.57/hour while non—whites earned $2.55 in 1972),

the on—the—job training differential was substantial: It equalled $5.97 — $3.37
or $2.60 per hour. In real terms, the true differential in 1966 ($1.39 per hour)
inflated for six years at a rate of 6% is equal to $1.99 per hour. Thus, there

—20—

is, if anything, an increase in the true differential for 1972. The major
distinction is that the pecuniary differential narrowed substantially while
the unobserved on—the—job training differential expended by a greater amount.

This may be a response to government pressure to reduce pecuniary wage differentials.

It should be noted that in this equation the coefficient on D(E) is
positive and relatively large (although its standard error is also quite

large). This was not the case during the first period analyzed. There it
appeared that, initial conditions the same, experience—induced wage growth
was not larger for whites than for non—whites. The difference there arose
from differences in mean initial conditions. Here, even holding all else
constant (including initial wage), the experience induced wage growth is

larger for whites than for non—whites. The difference of the coefficients
on D(tE) between 1966 and 1972 is equal to .0950 with a standard error of

.0694. Thus, although there is a somewhat large standard error, there
appears to be some evidence for a change in the coefficient on D(E) over
—

time, as well as evidence for changes in the difference

2. Some useful comparisons
Before reaching the firm conclusion that whatever narrowing of the pecuniary
ditferential has occurred has been offset by increases in the OJT differential,
some points should be made.
First, it is important to note that 1966—1969 was a period of rapid
economic activity while 1972—1974 was a recession. (The unemployment rate for
white males 16 years of age and older averaged 2.6% between 1966—1969 and

4.2% between 1972 and 1974.) This has major implications for the estimates
obtained.

—21—

Note, for example, that the coefficient on initial experience (E66 and

E ) bounces

from negative to positive. The negative coefficient on E

is

explained elsewhere (see Lazear 1976) as reflecting the fact that OJT

acquired during the first years at work. The positive coefficient on

is

E72

is likely to capture the fact that given initial wage rates, more senior
workers are less affected by recessions than are their more junior counterparts.
If this is the explanation, the effect is sufficient to offset the tendency to
invest more during early years. Similarly, DII had a positive sign in the

1966—69 regression, but a negative, one later. The reversal may be due to

simultaneity bias brought on by recessionary changes. If the recession lovers
the wages of some workers, in the short run they may increase their hours worked.

This finding has shown up in past work.13 Thus, the negative coefficient or 1ii
might reflect the fact that those individuals who experience relative
declines in wages also iicrease their hours worked during recessions.
(.

Another difference across periods which may result from differences
in business activity relates to the levels of the on—the—job training com-

ponent. The absolute magnitude of this compensation is much larger
between 1972 and 1974 than it was in the earlier period. There are at
least two possible explanations. First, along the lines of Butler and
Heckman (1976), the differential attractiveness of welfare payments to
low v. high income individuals will tend to cause only the most able workers

to remain. This is especially the case during recessions (since more drop
below the point at which this alternative source of income is acceptable)

so that the 1972—1974 sample of individuals who are working is of higher

average ability than the sample of workers during 1966—1969. (They are
also more able in that they all have attended school through grade twelve.)

If, as is likely to be the case, the more able invest more in on—the—job

—22—

taining, this would show up as a higher OJT componrtt for the mean working
individual between 1972 and 1974. Second, I have argued elsewhere, (Lazear
(1974) ),

that

it is rational to acquire OJT to a greater extent during

recessions than during expansions. If so, the difference between the
two periods would be a manifestation of this phenomenon.
The point raised by Butler and Heckman (1976) has other implications

for this analysis. For example, it helps explain the total disappearance

of a pecuniary wage differential y 1972. Since non—whites are more likely
to be pulled out of the labor force by alternative welfare payments, those

who remain will be of higher average quality than the working whites. This
would result in a narrowing of the differential. It cannot, however, account
for the finding of this paper that the non—whites' gains in pecuniary wages

were offset by losses in OJT compensation. In fact, the effect works in
the opposite direction. Since during recessions, non—white males exit
the employment force to a larger extent than do whites, the 1972—1974

period has relatively high quality non—'hites. Since they are the individuals most likely to invest in OJT, the white—non—white OJT differential

would narrow between 1966 and 1972 on this score. It does not. Selectivity
effects are not sufficiently large to disguise the substitution from
pecuniary differentials to OJT differentials.

The fact that pecuniary wage differentials have narrowed to a greater

extent for the highly educated can be explained by these findings. Since
education and OJT were found to be complementary, highly educated non—whites

had a larger OJT component in 1966 than did the less educated. If, say,
the same proportion of OJT was reduced for all non—whites, pecuniary wages

would rise by more in absolute terms for the highly educated. This would
imply a greater narrowing of the differential for this group. Note that
the narrowing of wage differentials to a larger extent for educated groups

—23—

is inconsistent with Butler and Heckman (1976). This explanation reconciles
thair story with the observed result since true differentials do not seem
to have narrowed at all.

A final point is that the R2 on the 1972—1974 regression is considerably
lower than the

for 1966—1969. The later data set deals with a much more

homogeneous group than the former. (There is no variation in initial schooling
and very little in age and previous experience.) Thus, regressions on the
NLSHS are asked to perform a much more difficult task than are those on the
original NLS.

3. More details
In this section, some of the points considered for the 1966—1969 analysis
are examined for the 1972—1974 period.

First, the 1972—1974 regression was performed for the non—student sub-

sample. Again tS, ST, and (LS)(E) were deleted. Standard errors increased,
but the coefficient on D(E) was still positive and substantial at .09002
(.07988)
—
—
= $6.46 yielding a true
Furthermore, F(1972)IDl = $10.06 and F(1972)
differential of $3.60 per hour. The observed differential was only $2.64 —

$2.56 or 7 per hour. It should also be noted that the $2.52 differential
obtained for the non—student group in 1966, when inflated at six per cent

per year, becomes $3.61 in 1972 dollars. This compares quite favorably
to the estimated $3.60 differential for 1972.

Again, the test for an (Age)(E) interaction was performed. Neither

age, age(E), nor the two taken jointly entered significantly. Nor did
stratification of the sample into two separate groups on the basis of age
yield significantly different results.

Summary and Conclusion:

This paper suggests that calculations of white — non—white wage differentials
which are based on observed monetary wage rates understate true differentials

by a substantial amount. This is the result of differences in the steepness
of the age—earnings profiles across groups, the value of which should be

capitalized and added to current earnings. For young men, for whom the
effect is likely to be strongest, the normally measured wage differential was

found to be 58 per hour in 1966. The "true" differential, which includes
the capitalized value of wage growth, was two and one half times as large. For

1972, the observed differential was 2 per hour. The true differential was
$2.62 per hour. Even in terms of relative wage differentials the point
remains valid. The observed relative wage rate was 1.37 in 1966 and l.Ol
in 1972. The true relative wage rates were 1.48 in 1966 and 1.44 in 1972.
This implies a much smaller narrowing than appears from examination of
pecuniary wages.
The most important conclusion is that although white — non—white pecuniary

wage differentials were eliminated between 1966 and 1972, the true differential,
which includes the value of on—the—job training, remained approximately the same.
This may reflect a national response on the part of employers to government
pressure to narrow pecuniary wage differentials, especially for young workers.

It was found that about 95 percent of the unobserved differential in
1966 could be eliminated by bringing the average level of non—whites' school-

ing, currently at 10.088 years, to that for whites, at 11.464 years. This
results primarily from the fact that on—the—job training seems to be complementary with level of schooling attainment so that, other things equal,
highly schooled individuals have steeper age—earnings profiles.
Finally, this paper has considered only one aspect of unobserved earnings,

namely payment In the form of human

capital.

For young men, this is substantial,
