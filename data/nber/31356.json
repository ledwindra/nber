    "abstract": "\n\nThe local availability of credit shaped whether, and how, farmers adapted to the long 1950s US drought. Investment in irrigation increased substantially more in drought-exposed areas with greater access to bank finance. Overall, these areas suffered significantly less population decline, both in the short- and long term. Thus, enhancing local access to finance can enable communities to adapt to large adverse climatic shocks, limiting outmigration.\n\n",
