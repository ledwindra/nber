    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore workers\u2019 valuation of job flexibility, using a field experiment conducted on a Chinese job board. Our experimental job ads differ randomly in offering jobs that are flexible regarding when one works (time flexibility) or where one works (place flexibility), and offering different salaries. Application rates are higher for flexible jobs, conditional on the salary offered, providing evidence that workers value job flexibility. Moreover, under some plausible conditions our evidence is informative about job seekers\u2019 willingness to pay for flexible jobs of the types offered in the experiment, and points to fairly high valuation of the most flexible jobs.\n\n",
