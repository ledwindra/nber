Unions and Equal Employment Opportunity
ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes differences in the growth of minority and female
employment between union and non-union manufacturing plants in California

during the late l970's, In this sector, unionized plants do not exhibit any
more gross employment discrimination than do non—union plants against black or
Hispanic men, or against black or white women, despite the recessions of the

1970's that displaced low seniority workers. Black males actually enjoy faster
growth of employment share in unionized plants, suggesting that Title vii has
been effective in increasing opportunities for blacks.

This may help explain

why unionization, though decreasing in the private sector, has been increasing

among blacks. The role played by unions in mediating affirmative action
regulations is also examined.

There are significant differences across particular unions, especially
between craft and industrial unions, within industries that correspond with

each union's public record on EEO. Black employment increases most rapidly in
industries with a long history of black employment, in plants organized by
unions that take a liberal position towards EEO, and in industries with a large

union wage effect. As least in California manufacturing during this period,
the belief that unions have hindered minority and female employment does not
seem to hold true for industrial unions.

How harmful or helpful have unions been to the employment interests of minorities and females? In the political sphere, the AFL-CIO has often joined with blacks and

females in a familiar coalition. In the workplace, these groups have not been able to
forge a unity of interest. Open conflicts, including litigation and demonstrations, have
often emerged at the local level.

This paper asks one main question: what impact have unions had on the employment of minorities and females in manufacturing? To determine whether minority and

female employment has been helped or hindered by unionism, the change during the
late 1970's in the employment of male and female Hispanics, blacks, whites and Asians

is compared across union and non-union plants.

Two secondary issues are also addressed. First, how have unions mediated
affirmative action pressure? The success of federal policies to improve employment

opportunities for minorities and females depends not only on the response of
employers, as this problem has usually been modeled, but also on that of unions. The
study of the impact of federal anti-discrimination and affirmative action regulation is

still young, and has yet to seriously address the role played by unions in mediating
regulatory pressure1. Union seniority provisions came into sharp conflict with equal

employment opportunity policy during the stagnant seventies. While this provoked

many anecdotes and law cases, the actual impact on employment of this conflict
involving federal, corporate, and union policy has never been studied with the attention it deserves.

Second, why has unionization increased so dramatically among blacks at the
same time that private sector unionism is in decline? The study design here isolates
from the confounding eflects of regional, industry or establishment growth, directly
controls for affirmative action pressure, and attempts to separate individual union,
establishment and demographic group effects in explaining this growth.

This study analyzes a new and detailed longitudinal set of data on 1273 California

-2manufacturing establishments between 1974 and 1980. The ethnic diversity of this
state provides informative contrasts across Hispanics, Asians, blacks and whites. The

analysis proceeds in five stages. First, we establish the expected roles played by
unions, firms, demographic groups, and the government within the framework of a
model of the supply and demand for union and non-union labor. Second, we estimate
the mean difference in demographic changes in employment between union and nonunion plants using both T-tests across means and weighted log-odds regressions, and

find that in the late 1970's blacks' employment share increases faster in the union
sector. Third, to isolate a general proclivity toward unionism among minorities or
females from the behavior of unions themselves, we exploit the distribution of unions

across establishments and industries to estimate differences across individual unions
in minority and female employment growth. Fourth, to test for spillover and omitted
variable bias, employment patterns among white-collar workers are also studied. The
interaction of affirmative action with unionism is analyzed in the fifth section, and our
conclusions are summarized in the final section.

The goal here is to open a new level of empirical research on the question of the

impact of unionization on minority and female employment. The central finding is
that unions have not been a significant detriment to the employment of minorities or
females.

Section 1. Background

Why should the unionized sector in manufacturing be any different than its nonunion counterpart in its employment of Hispanics, blacks, Asians, and women? In

broadest terms, there are four major actors whose policies and preferences are of
immediate concern. These are the unions, the companies, the demographic groups,
and the federal government. In this section, we shall first place each of these actors
within a model of minority and female employment, and then proceed to discuss their
expected roles.

-3The demand for labor may usefully be thought of as:

L=f(USF5,D,w5)

(1)

where

demand for labor of demographic group j by firm i

U=

unionization

S=

F=

W=

The supply of labor is given by:

L=F(G5,S.,71,)

where

G = geographic commuting cost

S = skill availability
T = average group preferences
This model is presented chiefly to structure the following discussion of expected

impact and paths. We shall return to it again at the end of this section to set up
empirical tests that isolate union, demographic group, establishment, and government
e tTe ct s.

The Role of Unions

The first impulse is to ascribe diflerences between the union and non-union sec-

tors to the policies and practices of the unions themselves. The most obvious way

unions can aect the demographic composition of the workforce is by directly

-4controlling hiring. The key distinction here is between craft and industrial unions, or

more precisely and tautologically, between referral and non-referral unions. Under
Landrum-Griffin, construction unions have what is in practice a closed shop with the

union often controlling who may be hired. The broad scope this gives to discrimination is revealed in studies which show evidence of discrimination against blacks in the
unionized construction trades, but not in other unionized occupations. As the history

of the construction, longshoring, maritime and printing trades shows, the legal restrictions on unions control of hiring are not always honored in practice. In California
manufacturing, typically thought of as non-referral, it is not uncommon to find
modified referral clauses in collectively bargained contracts. Typically, the company
agrees to notify the union first when a job opens2. The question of referral practices

in the unions is an empirical one that cannot be resolved by reference to contractual
provisions or labor law. While the substantial differences between construction craft
unions and others is universally acknowledged, there is no evidence that rules out the

power of unions in the manufacturing sector to influence the hiring decisions of
employers.

If, as seems reasonable, we grant the unions in manufacturing some influence,

then their attitudes become important, and these attitudes are strongly shaped by
circumstances3. To bargain effectively an industrial union must organize enough of
its industry to reduce the elasticity of demand. for union labor. Unions faced with an
industry employing substantial numbers of blacks or females have typically found it in

their hearts to take a more liberal stand toward the employment and organizing of

such potential competitors. (Ashenfelter 1973, Fogel, Marshall). But these crossindustry patterns cannot easily explain the relative prevalence of blacks, for example,
in union plants within an industry. Differences are relative, so an egalitarian union

may appear angelic next to a discriminating non-union sector. But the historical
record shows unions following, and forced to adapt to the relative lack of discrimina-

-5tion in the non-union sector. (Marshall, Fogel).

Seniority is one of the ruling principles of industrial unionism. It is well known

that quit rates are much lower in the union sector, in response to strong seniority
benefits, high compensation, and the union voice mechanism. (Block, Freeman). This
in itself will tend to freeze the workforce and slow the entry of any previously discrim-

inated against group, a point we shall return to in Section 5. So even in the absence of

current discrimination, we would expect minorities and females to make slower progress in increasing their share of employment in the union sector.

Since 1965 the courts have often struggled with the problem raised by facially
neutral seniority systems that lock in the effects of past discrimination. The conflict
between union seniority clauses and federal anti-discrimination and affirmative action

policy has been painfully exposed by recent recessions when last-in first-out union
seniority clauses have helped undo years of federal pressure to increase minority and
female employment. The problem has been exacerbated by the unionized sector's tendency to resort to layoffs during a downturn. (Medoff). The Supreme Court in its 1977

Teamsters decision overruled a series of lower court decisions in which seniority systems had come under attack for freezing out a generation of blacks.4 This ruling gave

greater weight to Section 703(h) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, largely insulating

seniority units that are created and administered in a non-discriminatory fashion
from charges of locking in pre-1965 discrimination. An employer who might be suc-

cessfully sued under Title VII for his low representation of females or minorities is
largely immunized from such suit if this underrepresentation is due to the functioning

of a seniority system that has been non-discriminatory in intent and administration
since 1965.

We would expect then that during the late seventies minorities and females would
make smaller employment gains in the union sector, both because union seniority sys-

tems reduce workforce turnover, and because such systems tend to insulate the firm

-6from Title VII damages.

Unions' attitudes toward minorities and females may also be influenced by their
desire to maintain one rate of pay for each job no matter who holds it, and by the con-

tingencies of liberal coalition politics at the national level. But it is a long road down

to the locals, which respond more closely to their own local problems than to the
noble words of their national leaders. (Marshall). While the nationals have some con
cern with maintaining the union's share of an industry, the locals have typically taken
a more exclusionary stand.
The Role of the Federal Government

The protection afforded unionized plants under Section 703(h) of Title VII has
already been noted. The other arm of federal policy in this arena is affirmative action

regulation under Executive Order 11246 and its successors. This pressure is directed

towards federal contractors, not directly against unions in the manufacturing sector.
The legal limits of such compulsion are largely circumscribed by reference to Title VTI,

so the same judicial interpretations that immunize unionized establishments under
Title VII tend also to insulate them from affirmative action pressure.

Unionized establishments are more likely than their non-union counterparts to
be federal contractors in the study sample. A more important finding is that among
contractors, union plants are not any more likely to undergo a compliance review, the

chief affirmative action enforcement procedure. While there are major cases in the
past of the government setting out after construction unions, most notably in the Philadelphia Plan and its progeny, the government appears to be largely neutral between
the union and non-union sectors of manufacturing.
The Employers

There seems little reason to expect unionized employers to act dierently, ceteris

paribus, in their employment of minorities and females for reasons other than the

indirect influence of the unions or the government mentioned above, or the direct
impact of the union wage effect. Unions have been estimated to raise wages by 15 to
20 percent in the manufacturing sector, (Lewis). This will tend to reduce employment

in the unionized sector and may work against minorities or females in hiring if they

are less skilled. But it is not clear that these groups are any less productive than
whites in ways that are material to manufacturing. (Leonard). In addition, unionized

plants tend to be larger, and are more likely to be part of a multi-plant corporation.
These two factors, along with the fact of unionization itself, contribute to more for-$
malized personnel procedures that may reduce discrimination.
Demographic Group Differences

The relative employment of blacks may be greater in the union sector than in the

non-union sector not because of the preferences of the unions, the government, or

the employers, but rather because of the preferences of blacks themselves. In a
number of studies during the 1970's, blacks are reported to have much stronger
preferences than whites for unions. (Farber and Saks, Freeman and Medoff, Kochan).
The evidence is less clear on preferences among women and Hispanics. This need not

imply that blacks have different utility functions, but rather that blacks face a
different set of constraints and so value unions more highly. It is in this latter sense

that preferences shall be referred to here. This preference is usually attributed to
the relative freedom from discrimination afforded blacks and others by unions' egalitarian policies. For example, a recent study found no evidence of a racial differential

in the impact of unions on opportunities for occupational advance or on job tenure.
(Leigh, 1979). This explanation must be tempered by the abundant litigation charging

unions with maintaining discriminatory seniority units, although it cannot be denied

that unions tend to protect workers from arbitrary treatment at the hands of the
employer. Both the NLRB and the courts have upheld the responsibility of unions as

exclusive bargaining agents to fairly represent minority and female employees. The

-8relative egalitarianism of the union sector has probably diminished over time as condi-

tions have improved in the non-union sector. Recent studies of racial wage discrimination in CPS samples find that the difference between the union and non-union sector has narrowed, largely because of the overriding equalizing force of Title VII. (Freeman and Medoff).

Of greater importance perhaps in explaining black preferences is the union wage

effect. in 1967, this was greater for black males and for white females than for white
males, although black females lagged behind the others. (Ashenfelter, 1973). At this
time, black males and white females had more to gain from working in a union plant.
The higher return for blacks among experienced men is still observed when probability of selection into the union sample is controlled for. (Leigh, 1980). During the 1974

recession, as the union wage effect for white males increased, this difference nar-

rowed. The ratio of black male to white male union wage effects dropped from a
remarkable 2.24 in 1967 to 1.38 in 1975. (Ashenfelter, 1979). Just as striking, during
this stagnant period for white male unionization, the proportion of black males org an-

ized increased from .32 in 1965 to .37 in 1975, and the proportion of black females
unionized increased from .13 to .22. (Ashenfelter, 1979). The substantial increase in
black unionization is concentrated between 1970 and 1975, and cannot be explained

by changes in the distribution of blacks across occupations or industries. (1-loizer).
This growth may give some measure of the strong impact of Title VII of the Civil Rights

Act of 1964 in allowing blacks to realize their preferences in the job market, a question we hope to shed some light on here.

Empirical Strategy

To summarize these countervailing forces briefly, the question to be addressed

empirically in the next section is whether blacks' stronger preferences for unions
outweighs the impact of unions in slowing change in the composition of the workforce.

The government's role is expected to be essentially neutral across sectors, and is

-9directly controlled for since we know which establishments are federal contractors
subject to affirmative action, and which have undergone a compliance review. Bias due

to the possible impact of individual establishment effects is guarded
against in two
ways. First, all regressions control for past establishment employment patterns, and
so essentially difference out time invariant individual effects. Secondly white-collar
employment patterns in which the unions have little say, are compared to blue-collar

patterns, with the difference attributed to unions. Union effects, as distinct from
a
generalized preference for unions by any particular demographic group, are tested
both by differentiating the union impact on blacks, Hispanics, and females;
and by
estimating the impact of individual unions.
Section 2. Unions and the Employment of Hispanics, Blacks, and Females

Unionized establishments exhibit strikingly different employment patterns than
non-unionized establishments in the same industry and SMSA. In light of the fact
that
unions in the manufacturing sector
cannot legally control hiring and in light of the
prevalent view that they do not directly influence hiring, this is a remarkable finding
made more so by the direction of the effect.

Table 1 presents T-tests of the equality across union and non-union establishments of the levels and changes in the racial and sexual composition of the blue-collar
workforce between 1974 and 1980 in a longitudinal sample of 1273 California
manufac-

turing establishments with at least one hundred employees each. The characteristics
and construction of this new sample are described in the appendix.
Unionized establishments start out in 1974 with a higher representation of black
males, 6.6% compared to 4.9% for the non-union establishments. More
importantly,
black males' employment share grows faster in the union sector5. It reaches 7.7% in
1980, compared to 5.3% among the non-unionized. The rate of change in
means is 17

percent in the union sector in just six years, far greater than the 6 percent in the
flOfl-Ufljon sector. The mean rates of change in both sectors are even greater,

- 10 -

suggesting

that growth in employment share has been relatively greater where that

share was initially low6.

Comparing the changes in employment patterns of black males to that of Hispanic
males, black females, or Hispanic females warns that there can be no simple monol-

ithic explanation of the higher level and faster growth rate of black male employment
share in the union sector. Whatever process preferentially sorts black males into

union jobs has not similarly affected black females, Hispanic males, or Hispanic
females.

Hispanic males do start out with higher representation in the union sector but
faster non-union growth renders this difference insignificant by 1980. Female Hispan-

ics are initially significantly more heavily represented in non-union jobs, and this
differential grows over time. Black females also start out with greater employment
share in the non-union sector, but their growth rates do riot differ significantly across
sectors. In both sectors, the greatest proportional employment gains are enjoyed by

Asians of both sexes, because they begin with such small shares. Asian growth has
been significantly greater in the non-union sector. It is also remarkable that between
1974 and 1980 whites lost their majority position in California manufacturing. Their
share dropped by 21 percent from .61 to .48 of blue-collar employment. White females

share fell faster in the non-union sector. For white males, there is no significant
difference in the decline across sectors.

It is important to note that total employment has not increased in the union sector, although smaller plants have grown. Absolute minority and female employment in
this sector has grown while white male employment has clec].ined. This finding stands
out in view of the commonly held belief about the impact of union seniority ladders on

minority and female employees. Last-in first-out would be expected to reduce minor-

ity and female share during a recession because these groups typically have lower
seniority than white males. The explanation may simply be that California manufac-

-11turing did not suffer from a great recession between 1974 and 1980. In the

study sam-

ple, employment in the union sector was stable. According to the Department
of
Labor, total employment in California manufacturing increased by 18 percent between
1974 and 1980, with an insignificant decline between 1979 and 1980, and

a 6 percent

decline between 1974 and 1975. (Employment and Training Report of the
President
1981, Table d-2, p. 230).

California serves as a strong warning against the facile identification of

minority
with black. Hispanics are the largest minority group in California, onstituting
38 percent of blue-collar employment in manufacturing in 1980. This compares with black's

9 percent and Asians' 8 percent, and is not far behind white's 48

percent. Moreover,
Hispanics have grown the fastest, increasing their share fully 10 percentage
points in

just six years from .28 in 1974. This sharp growth has not been accommodated
without conflict. The California State President of the Mexican-American
Political

Association, Julio Calderon, has said that the:

"[Civil Rights movement] has pitted the black community against the
Mexican-American community. This may be unspeakable, but to deny that it
exists is to put blinders on oneself" (Oakland Tribune 3/24/83 p. A-14)

It must at once be recalled that the dominant pattern we find here is an increase
in Hispanic share and a corresponding decrease in white share, alongside
a smaller
increase in black share.
Log-Odds Estimates

The basic results found in the means above stand up well in more rigorous tests.
The definitions and sample statistics of the variables used in this analysis
are given in
Table 2. Table 3 presents our central regression results. These
are estimates of logodds models, weighted by the establishment's total blue-collar employment,
and controlling for past employment share, two or three digit SIC industry, SMSA, and the
percent of blue-collar workers who are craft workers. The essential findings here
are in

- 12 -

control for
general not significantly changed by weighting. These regressions also
establishment size and growth rate, and whether or not the establishment was union-

ized, part of a multi-plant company, a federal contractor subject to affirmative action
in 1974, or reviewed for compliance with affirmative action between 1974 and 1980.

With these extensive and detailed controls, black male share still increases
significantly faster in the union sector. As can be seen in equation 2 of Table 3, this
difTerence of 1.3 percentage points is not small. It amounts to 19 percent of their initial share.

The relative size of the union impact here can best be appreciated by comparing
it with that of affirmative action. Equation 2 also shows that the increase in black

male employment share is significantly larger among federal contractors subject to
affirmative action, and among contractors that are reviewed for compliance7. The

impact of unionization is just slightly less than that of undergoing a compliance
review, and actually greater than that of being a federal contractor. Before entering
into the question of causality, it is remarkable that in the case of California manufacturing unionization appears to act as a more powerful affirmative action program for
black males than does the federal affirmative action program itself.

It has often been argued that black males' employment is limited by their lack of

skills. It is then worth noting that in this sample their share of blue-collar employment among all males has increased most in craft-intensive work-forces. In addition,
the overall importance of growth in facilitating the entry of minorities and females

into manufacturing can be seen in the significant negative impact of establishment
growth on white male employment, a summary measure.

In contrast to the faster increase in black male employment in the union sector,
unionization has had no significant impact on Hispanic male employment, nor on that
of black females, white females, or Asian males8. If black males' improved employment

under unionism were due only to blacks' attitudes toward unions or proximity to

13 -

unionized establishments, or to unionized establishments' employment
practices, one

might reasonably expect similar patterns among blacks of both sexes, but we find no
significant evidence of such a pattern for black females. Black males not only differ
from black females, they also differ from Hispanic males. The theory of discrimination

that explains why predominantly white unionized establishments should favor the
employment of black males, while treating Hispanic males indifferently at best, cannot
be a simple one9.

The salient finding in this section is that black male employment share has
increased faster in the union sector. In the following sections we turn to questions of

causality and attempt to determine how much of this difference can be explained by
union policy, or by differences in employer or government behavior across sectors.
Section 3. Differences Across Unions

Unions are not undifferentiated in either their attitudes or their policies toward
affirmative action, or in their actual minority and female membership. Because many

large unions have organized plants across a number of industries, and because most
industries have been organized by a number of unions, it is possible to separate out
the impact of individual unions. If there were no significant differences across unions
once industry, SMSA, and plant occupational structure were controlled for, that would
constitute strong evidence that the swifter expansion of black male employment share

in the unionized sector was primarily due to black males' stronger preference for
union jobs, rather than to any policy or practice of any individual unions. That does

not appear to be the case here. There are significant differences in minority and
female employment growth across unions that in a number of cases correspond
closely to differences in these unions' public statements on discrimination and
affirmative action.

Here only the most striking cases can be alluded to. Union A, long noted for its

liberal stance, has been among the most outspoken proponents of equal rights for

- 14 blacks. In contrast to most AFL unions, Union A accepted and integrated

blacks into

existing locals as blacks entered this union's primary industry during the depression.

In these early years the union was among the pioneers in formally establishing an
internal fair employment practices department. While taking a strong stand on civil
rights at the national level, Union A has also been a co-defendant in a plethora of Title

VII litigation charging that it maintained discriminatory seniority ladders at the local
level. It would seem the union had reached only partial accommodation with its black
members.

in 1982, Union A held contracts in eight dierent two-digit SIC industries in California manufacturing. Table 4 shows that both black and Hispanic males have aug-

mented their share of blue-collar employment significantly more in the twenty-five
plants organized by Union A than in most other unionized plants. However discrimina-

tory union seniority ladders may have been, they have not discouraged black or
Hispanic males from gaining employment. While the average union impact is to raise
black male employment share by 1.3 percentage points, the corresponding increase in

plants organized by Union A is 2.8 percentage points. For Hispanic males the
diflerence is even greater. Their employment share grows slower, insignificantly, in
the union sector as a whole, but grows by 4.1 percentage points in Union A plants. In
fact, Union A is the only union with a significant positive impact on Hispanic employ-

ment. This reinforces the interpretation of these patterns as directly influenced by
union policy rather than just reflecting ethnic group preferences.
Union B's history has been similar in many ways to Union A's. While blacks have

long been employed in large numbers in Union B' primary industry, the union has
been the target of a large number of Title VII cases charging discriminatory seniority
ladders. But once again, black male employment share has grown significantly faster,
by two percentage points, than elsewhere in the union sector.

One explanation advanced for blacks' strong preference for union employment is

- 15 -

that egalitarianism within most unions limits the
scope for any discriminatory treat-

ment, including racial discrimination. The multitude of Title VII charges concerning

discriminatory promotion ladders at both Union A and B would seem to belie this
thesis, but one must consider the alternative. Blacks may prefer a unionized plant not

because discrimination is absent, but simply because it is weaker. Moreover, these
discrirninatory seniority systems have been frequently and successfully attacked in
the courts since 1965. At the same time, members of both Union A and B are among
the most well paid industrial workers in America. The substantial union wage efTect in

these unions are likely to be even larger for blacks, and may well outweigh the finer
costs of occupational segregation within the plant. Better to ride second class than to
walk.

While minority male employment gains at Union A correspond to the union's long
liberal history, Union C was prominently known before 1965 for its racially segregated

locals. By the late seventies things had changed. Black male employment share in the
57 plants organized by Union C significantly increased by 2.3 percentage points, more

than the average of other unions.

At the other extreme are a number of craft oriented unions in which minority and
female employment has fallen relative to other union or non-union plants. The exclu-

sionary ethic of these unions appears to carry over and influence employment patterns in manufacturing, where their referral rights are not so strongly established.

The evidence here suggests that an important part of the explanation for the
observed patterns of minority and female employrrient in general, and of the growth of

black male share in the union sector in particular, is to be found in the policies and

practices of individual unions. This stands out in the contrast between the craftoriented unions which appear to retard minority and female employment, and Union A

which increases black and Hispanic male employment share more so than do other
unions.

Section 4. White Collar Workers in Unionized Establishments

Establishments hire both white and blue collar workers, but typically it is only the
blue collar workers who are unionized, a difference which will be exploited in this sec-

tion. This institutional fact allows us to test whether the union effect found above is
really an establishment effect. The establishments that are unionized may differ in
some ways, such as location or skill requirements that are uncontrolled for, but
correlated with unionization. This is a priori unlikely because our controls are quite

detailed and include two or three digit SIC industry, SMSA, establishment size and
it
growth, and the proportion of craft workers among the blue-collar. Nevertheless,
cannot be entirely ruled out. While unionization may influence blue-collar employment it is difficult to see how unionization in itself can affect white-collar demographic s10.

It does. Black males share of white-collar jobs increases significantly faster in
unionized establishments, as seen in Table 5. Tn absolute terms the effect is small, less
than a quarter percentage point. However, relative to blacks males' 1974 share of 1.5
percent this is a substantial increase. The interpretation of this estimate is compli-

cated by the further findings in Table 5 that Hispanic males' share also increases
significantly faster in the union sector, while white females share increases
significantly less11. The result for white-collar Hispanic men may be due to stronger
affirmative action pressure in favor of Hispanic men in the union sector, particularly
for white-collar jobs.

Unionization affects white- collar employment demographics both directly and
indirectly through its impact on blue-collar demographics. The tests in Table 5 expli-

citly control for the indirect path by holding fixed past blue-collar employment share.
In every case higher past blue-collar share is significantly correlated with subsequent
white-collar share. even conditioning on past white-collar share, SMSA, and industry.
This suggests either strong spillover from blue-collar to white-collar or an omitted

- 17 -

variable such as proximity to minority neighborhoods.
The spillover hypothesis is con-

siderably strengthened by observing the same pattern for females, who do not live in
ghettos. Taken together, this evidence of spillover and tipping accords with the

essentially tribal model of the labor market that informs many of the arguments in favor

of

affirmative action.

The tests in Table 5 may then qualify the previous findings for black male

production workers because the union effects on white-collar demographics persist
even
when indirect paths through blue-collar employment are controlled for. In other

words, black male employment share in unionized establishments has increased in
white-collar jobs as well as in blue-collar jobs. It is important to remember that the
union effect among white-collar workers is less than that among the blue-collar.
Nevertheless, it is possible that unionization is correlated with some Uncontrolled for
establishment characteristic that favors the growth and not simply the level, of black
male employment12.

This section has shown that unionized

establishments not only employ more black

males in blue-collar jobs, to a lesser extent they also employ more black males in
white-collar jobs. Part of this effect may be accounted for by spillover from bluecollar demographics, but part remains and may suggest establishment specific effects.
Section 5. Unions and Affirmative Action

Under most circumstances, unions should retard the progress of minorities and
females under affirmative action for reasons that have much to do with unions but lit-

tie to do with current discrimination. It is well known that unions reduce quits. Lower
turnover will in itself reduce the rate of penetration of minorities and females into the
workplace, as we shall now prove.

An increase in black's share of hires or terminations has a greater impact on black's
share of stock the greater is the hire or termination rate respectively.
In theory the impact of affirmative action on protected groups' share of flows and

stock could be hidden by disparate turnover rates between union plants and nonunion plants. If a and b are both small (or of similar magnitude), then A is close to 1
and A is close to 1. In this case P changes only slowly from Pg_n. By the same token,
firms characterized by high turnover rates can show large improvements in minorities'
and females' employment share without large changes in hiring and firing policy. Thus

if affirmative action requires equal efTort from all firms, rather than equal results,
then high turnover firms should be held to higher employment goals along an adjustment path13.

For our purposes here, the important point to remember is that the seniority

sys-

tems that are part and parcel of unionism will tend to freeze the workforce at a plant,

a fact which the Supreme Court in its 1977 Teamsters decision has come to accept.
When this is combined with the fact that unionized employment did not grow in the
study sample, one would expect affirmative action to appear less successful in union-

ized establishments for two reasons that have nothing to do with discrimination: low
turnover and low growth.

On the other hand, we have already seen that while other protected groups have
not progressed significantly faster in the union sector, black males have. Black males

also start with a higher 1974 share in the union sector. Similarly, while other
protected groups have not significantly benefited from affirmative action in California
manufacturing, blacks have. One might then reasonably expect two such positives to

interact in a larger positive, but this would embody an oversimplified conception of

2D -

how affirmative action works.

The pressures under affirmative action are to remedy underutilization of minorities and females. If black males are relatively overrepresented in the union sector,

affirmative action can act to increase black males' overall share while bringing no
direct pressure to bear in the union sector. But of course, with a limited supply of
blacks, the non-union sector's gain may well be the union sector's loss. This is especially likely to occur if at the same time Hispanics are relatively underrepresented in
the union sector. The combined impact of the contract compliance program may then
be to substitute Hispanic males for black males in the union sector,

Table 6 tests for such interactions between unionization and affxmative action
pressure and finds significant evidence of a negative interaction only for black males.
Black males' employment share increases 3.1 percentage points more in unionized

non-contractors than in non-unionized non-contractors. By contrast, this share
increases by just 1.1 percentage points in unionized contractors compared to nonunionized contractors. This is balanced by changes in the employment of Hispanic
men, where there is a positive interaction between union and contractor status. In

the union sector, black males' share decreases by .004 among contractors, while
Hispanic males' share increases by .021. Affirmative action does not always and every-

where lead to increases in black employment, nor is it intended to. These estimates
suggest that while Hispanic male employment has increased faster under affirmative
action in the contractor sector, black male employment has increased slower, if at all.
This may reflect to some degree the relative abundance of black males in the union

sector, and correspondingly less affirmative action pressure to increase their share.
In 1974, 6.6 percent of all employees in the union sector were black males, compared
to only 4.9 percent in the non-union sector. While Hispanic males were also relatively
abundant in the union sector, the proportionate disparity was not so great, .21 in the

union sectors compared to .19 in the non-union sector. A plausible explanation of the

- 21 observed interactions is not in terms of the

way Unions mediate affirmative action pre-

sures, but rather in terms of the different immediate goals toward which that pressure

is directed in the union sector14. Judged on the evidence
among contractors, the
union sector appears more concerned with increasing Hispanic male
employment than

that of black males.
Section 6. Summary and Conclusion

This paper has presented four main findings.

(1) Black males share of blue-collar employment has increased faster in union
plants than in non-union plants in California manufacturing between 1974 and 1980.

This indicates that the growth in unionization among blacks is not due
simply to
different regional or industry growth rates. We find a positive union effect even when
industry, region, size, growth, and affirmative action pressure are controlled for. This

suggests that the wide precedents set by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has
opened doors for blacks to express their preferences in employment.
(2) While union seniority systems force the layoff of low-tenure workers during a
recession, the recessions of 1974 and 1979 did not harm minorities and females
any

more in the union than the non-Union sectors, judging on the basis of growth in
employment share between 1974 and 1980.

(3) Unionization has no significant impact on blue-collar employment share of

other groups, with the exception of a significantly negative impact on Hispanic
females. The notion that industrial unions as a whole are any more or less discriminatory is belied by the absence of significant effects for Hispanic males, black females,
and whites.

(4) There are significant differences across particular unions within industry and

region that correspond with each unions public record of EEO policy and practice.
Black male employment increases most in industries with a long history of black
employment, in unions that take a liberal position towards EEO, and in industries with

- 22
a large

-

union wage efcct. Craft type unions have a negative impact.

Changes in employment share among Hispanics, blacks, Asians, whites, and women
are a response to forces on both the supply arid demand sides of the market. Union-

ized establishments in California manufacturing do not exhibit any more discrimination than do non-union establishments against black or Hispanic men, or against black

or white women. Title VII appears to have been efective in increasing employment
opportunities for blacks, allowing them to obtain the union jobs they prefer.

Appendix. Data
A new and detailed set of information at the
establishment level of disaggregation

was assembled for this study. EEO-i reports detailing establishment level demographics were matched for the years 1974 and 1980 to produce a longitudinal file. All of
the
data on establishment demographics,
occupational structure, employment growth,

industry, location, and contractor status comes from this file. This was in turn
matched with OFCCP administrative records made available by the OFCCP's Division of

Program Analysis to determine which establishments had undergone an affirmative
action compliance review. These reviews essentially count only those performed by
the Department of Defense, and so are concentrated in the durable goods manufac-

turing industries. The characteristics of this EEO sample are discussed in greater
detail in other work. From this national longitudinal file, the 1273 establishments in
the manufacturing sector in California with more than 100 employees were selected.
California, while interesting in its own right, also accounted for 8.9 of all U.S.

manufacturing employment in 1977. For comparison, the 1977 Census of Manufactures counted 3278 California manufacturing establishments with at least 100
employ-

ees. Since all of these plants are required by law to file IEEO forms, the undercount is
significant. Roughly half the EEO sample is lost in the construction of the longitudinal

file. A careful study of similar sample attrition by Ashenfelter and Beckman
concluded that non-matches were largely random. The remaining undercount is unexplained. While one might imagine that plants with poor EEO records simply do not
report, this in itself should not bias our union/non-union comparison.

The union status of each of these establishments was determined by
examining
the 1982 collective bargaining contract collection of the California State Department
of Industrial Relations. The Department has more than 3,400 private-sector agreements on file, and makes intensive efTorts to obtain all contracts covering 50 or
more

employees. In 1982 this file included 1,364 contracts in the manufacturing sector,

- 24 in
covering 450,310 employees. Since unions never achieve contracts in many plants

which they are certified as exclusive bargaining agents, only plants with collective
bargaining agreements will be referred to as unionized in this paper.
The coverage of this file is extensive, especially for contracts covering more than
50 employees. According to the US Department of Labor there were 2,001,000 employ-

ees in California manufacturing in 1980. (Employment and Training Report of the
President, 1980, table d-2. p. 230). Applying the 1977 California average of 35 percent
non-production workers in manufacturing yields 1,300,650 production workers. (U.S.
Census of Manufactures, 1977, Vol. III, Geographic Area Series-California, Part I, Table

2b, pp. 5-8.) In a pooled 1973-1975 CPS sample of 6022 private-sector production
workers in California, Freeman and Medoff estimate the proportion unionized at .35,
close to the national average of .36. (Freeman and MedofT, 1979, p. 166, Table 4).
Nationally, Freeman and MedofT report that 49% of production workers in manufactur-

ing were union members. On this basis, we would expect to find 637,320 union
members among production workers in California manufacturing.
88 percent of all employees covered by collective bargaining agreements covering
at least 100 workers in California manufacturing are subject to union shop or modified

union shop security clauses. (California Department of Industrial Relations, 1982,
Table 1). So the contract file then includes about 396,000 union members, or 62 percent of the number we would expect to find by applying the Freeman-Me dofT estimates

of percent unionized to BLS totals. Part of this discrepancy may be due to the striking decline in unionism in California. Union members as a proportion of all production
workers in California manufacturing dropped from .56 in 1975 to .42 in 1979. (Califor-

nia Department of Industrial Relations, 1980, p.2, Table 1). If we adjust Freeman and
MedofT's 1973-1975 benchmark downwards by the same 25% to .37, then we would

expect 481,240 union members in California manufacturing. On this basis the con-

tract file includes 82% of all union members in California manufacturing. The

- 25 -

remainder are likely to be in establishments of less
than 100 employees which

are

excluded from the study sample. To the extent that some unionized
establishments
are still not identified as such, this measurement error will bias our results
against
finding any difference between the union and non-union sectors.

NOTES

See

2.

Brown for a discussion of recent work in this area.

Of coursc, these clauses are carefully worded to comply both with the closed-shop
prohibition and with Title VII, but there is no law against discriminating in favor of

friends of union members per se. Obviously, if it happens that all these friends
are white males, Title VII comes into play.

3. Note that minorities and females can undercut the union grievance system by
taking their case directly to the courts or the EEOC, as established in the case of
Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Company, and this internal political consideration
may influence unions' attitudes.

4. The law in this area is still developing, and was undergoing significant changes
during the period studied. Before 1977 the lower federal courts, most notably in
the case of Quarles v. Phillip-Morris, had judged seniority systems that perpetuated the eects of past discrimination to be illegal, and these early decisions
may have influenced some of the companies studied here. The blunt edge of
these court decisions gave rise in a number of cases to difficult negotiations to
reassign seniority rights and redraw seniority units. (Ichniowski). While the EEOC
has argued that 703(h) should only apply to collectively bargained seniority systems, one district court has recently extended it to non-union cases. (EEOC vs.
E.I. duPont De Nemours & Co. [D. Del. 1978]).
5.

Despite the increase in black male share in the union sector, the percentage of
black males who are unionized in the study sample faIls slightly from .72 in 1974
to .70 in 1980 because of the faster growth of total employment in the non-union

sector. While the number of black males employed in the union sector increased
by 17 percent, the number employed in the non-union sector increased by 27

percent.

Concerning the impact of affirmative action, in California manufacturing the

prc

gram has significant impacts on blacks and on white males. Both female and male

black employment shares increase significantly faster in establishments that
are

federal contractors, and at establishments that undergo a compliance review.
Although white males' share of total blue-collar employment does increase
significantly at contractor establishments, the increase in proportion to initial
1974 share is larger for black males, 19% compared to 14%, so black males' share

of male employment does increase among contractors. The observed pattern for

white males is not obviously compatible with an effective affirmative action

program, and is anomalous in the sense that it is not generally observed in the economy as a whole. A possible explanation is that since the union and defense con-

tractor sectors tend to be high-wage sectors, white males are relatively slower to
leave these sectors than others within
manufacturing. The largest minority in
California, the Hispanics, have not been greatly affected by affirmative action.
Their employment share grows slower at contractors and faster at reviewed

con-

tractors, but the effects are not significant. At the same time, white females
gained under affirmative action, but not significantly. Blacks may benefit by
being both small and vocal. It is more difficult to make room for a large protected

group, such as Hispanics or females, and the pressure to accommodate a quieter

8.

group may not be great. Questions concerning the impact of affirmative action
are the focus of a companion paper.
The distribution of each minority group in California is markedly different,
and
provides useful test variation. These regressions include five SMSA dummies,
whose coefficients and selection reflect
population demographics. The areas are
the Los Angeles SMSA, containing 47 percent of the sample; the combined San

- 28 -

Jose SMSA,
Diego, Anaheim, and Riverside SMSAs; the San Francisco SMSA, the San

all other Northern California counties, and all other Southern California counties.

Reflecting their respective population concentrations, black employment share
increases faster in Los Angeles and San Francisco than elsewhere in California.
Hispanic increases faster in Los-Angeles and San-Diego, and Asian increases fas-

ter in San Francisco and San Jose.
9.

In this regard. there are two factors that may help explain the observed pattern

for Hispanic males. First, compared to blacks, Hispanics are on average more
recent immigrants to California, and a large but unknown fraction are here iiC
gaily. They may well be further back in line for union jobs, and the illegals may
have greater trepidation and difficulty in obtaining employment at the larger and
more formal union establishments. Second, most studies of Hispanic-white earnings ratios have found little evidence of discrimination once language and educa-

tion are controlled for, (Reimers). If black males are attracted to union shops by
the insulation from discrimination they enjoy under the umbrella of union egalitarianism, it is possible that Hispanics may not feel as acute a need for such pro-

tection, but this is doubtful. It helps to compare Hispanics with blacks among
females. While unionization has had an insignificant positive impact on black
females, Hispanic female employment grows significantly slower in the union sector. This is more consistent with the view that Hispanics, as more recent immigrants, are further back in the queue for union jobs. A more closely knit Hispanic
family cannot explain the difference in employment across sectors.

10. There are, of course, indirect paths such as the company that promotes from the
ranks, or that hires supervisors who match the race or sex of its production

workers, who we have found are more likely to be black in the union sector.
Alternatively, this could come about through the clustering of blacks in establish-

ments that already employ many blacks. Plants, like neighborhoods. may tip. In

- 29 -

fact, one of the major arguments in favor of affirmative
action rests upon just

such externalities: the costs of searching for and obtaining a job are lower if
merribers of one's group are already employed at a given plant. Firms are
required to reach out to potential minority and female employees to counteract

such clustering among predominant white males. Leaving these indirect, but
potentially important, paths aside, we would not expect the presence of a collective bargaining contract among the production workers of a plant to have
any
impact on the demographic composition of the non-production work-force.
11. These last two patterns for white-collar workers are reversed among blue-collar

workers, although the coefficients in the latter case are insignificant. This sign
reversal on the union efTect between white-collar and blue-collar workers sug-

gests that a simple omitted variable bias story is not likely to explain the union
efTect on Hispanic males and white females.

12. Since SMSA is controlled for, this would require, for example, that the unionized
plants in Los Angeles be closer to Watts and other concentrations of black popula-

tion than are non-union plants. Since the sample of plants is longitudinal, this
cannot simply be due to the establishment of new plants in the suburbs after
1974. Also note that this within SMSA geographic proximity cannot explain why

white-collar Hispanic males are more heavily represented at union plants at the
same time relative gains for their blue-collar brothers are nowhere to be seen.

Moreover, while black male employment has increased relative to that of white
males in the union sector, no such efTect was observed in Tables 3 among blue-

collar females. Unionisni is associated with a 5 percent greater employment
share for black females, which is less than the 9 percent for white females. It is
also interesting to note that a pioneering study of Chicago establishment demographics between 1967 and 1970 also found a positive union effect on growth of

black male share even after controlling for distance from black residence area.

- 30 -

(Burman).

To t' othe example, since two arid sometimes three digit SIC

inductry is controlled for, along with the percent of craft workers among bluecollar, arid the percent of clerical workers among white-collar, this omitted vari-

able bias argument would require that the skill requirements of union plants
diner in very fine ways that favor blacks not only in blue-collar jobs, but also in
white-collar jobs, yet at the same time hinder Hispanic employment. While possible, in my opinion these scenarios are unlikely. The question of geographic proxiruity is addressed in detail in a companion paper. In a sub-sample of Los Angeles
and Orange County establishments, the union eflect on both white and blue-collar
workers persists even when distance from the ghetto is controlled for. The sim-

plest explanation is that many of the white-collar workers in this sample are in
fact unionized, as fully 29 percent of all black male managerial workers were
reported to be in 1967. (Ashenfelter, 1973).

13. Affirmative action might be successful in increasing blacks' share of hires, H, and
reducing their share of terminations, T, at union establishments. But since these

establishments typically have lower turnover rates a and b than non-union estab-

lishments, the change in stock

is expected to be lower, masking the impact of

affirmative action. Unionized plants are characterized by relatively stable work
forces of long tenure. Unless long-tenure jobs are themselves the product of an
intention to discriminate, which is unlikely, it is appropriate to judge affirmative
action in such stable industries by its impact on minorities' and females' share of

new hires and terminations rather than their share of employment. Since the
workforces turnover slowly, a positive change in flow shares will have to cumulate
for years before it has a significant efTect on employment stock shares

14. Absent strong demonstration etTects, that pressure should be most obvious in the
case of compliance reviews but here the interactions terms are insignificant and
the evidence inconclusive.
