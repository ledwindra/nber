RIVALRY AND CROWDING-OUT IN THE NONPROFIT FIRM'S

ABSTRACT

This paper extends previous research on Individuals' supply of charitable
donations to the behavior of nonprofit firms.

Specifically, we study

of charity care by private, nonprofit hospitals. We demonstrate

that In the absence of large positive income effects on charity care supply,

convex preferences for the nonprofit hospital imply crowding out by other
private or government hospitals. Extending our model
heterogeneity

to include patient

and impure altruism (rivalry) provides a possible explanation

for the previously reported empirical

result that Q.th crowding out and

income effects on indigent care supply are often weak or insignificant.
Empirical

analysis of data for hospitals

in Mary1and provides strong

evidence of rivalry on the supply of outpatient plus inpatient charity care,
but not when the analysis is confined to inpatient care.

We

also allow for the possibility that the hospital receives a subsidy payment
from the government for providing care to the indigent based on the volume
of such care provided; we assume the per unit amount of this subsidy is
below both marginal cost and the price paid by nonindigent patients so that

of this care represents a "charitable contribution' on the

part of the hospital.

91n the hospital field, private nonprofit institutions are referred to
as 'voluntary.'
The classification of hospitals as voluntary was based on
information published by the American Hospital Association in its annual
Guide to the Health Care Field. Some general acute care hospitals
classified as voluntary during at least one year of the study period were
excluded from our study sample because they were major teaching hospitals
(Johns Hopkins, Francis Scott Key, and University of Maryland) or because
they were newly opened or changed ownership status to voluntary during the
period (Shady Grove Adventist, Memorial of Cumberland, Wyman Park, Greater
Laurel, Prince Georges).

Figures for Prince Georges General and

the American Hospital Association as voluntary in 1983 and 1984, because the

was expected to be low, we also estimated

in which a single set of charity-care-supply

variables

(aggregated across ownership categories) was included (ALLUCEQUA and
ALLSPCDIS).

In addition, some regressions were run with a dummy variab]e

indicating that a hospital was the only one in its county (ONLYHOS).
Three variables were included as proxies for the level of need (T):
the estimated number of persons with no public or private health insurance

coverage (NOINS),13 the number of births to residents of the county
(RBIRTHS), and the number of deaths in the county due to external causes
(accidents, homicide, etc.)

(EXDEAD).

The rationale for including RBIRTHS

and EXDEAD is that obstetrical deliveries

and accident cases account for a

very large fraction of inpatient admissions of self-pay and charity cases;
one recent estimate puts this fraction at about one half (Sloan, Valvona,
and Muliner,

1986).

The applicability

of this fact to Maryland may be

and 1981), and Baltimore City. Harford and Prince Georges were the only
counties with for-profit hospital beds.
