The following conclusions emerge: rules which performed best for some shocks performed poorly for others; monetary policy was ineffective in limiting movements in real exchange rates; unconstrained use of fiscal policy was quite powerful in influencing real variables; and dynamic instability was a potentially serious problem. Robustness to different specifications and to constraints on instruments remains to be examined.\n\n",
