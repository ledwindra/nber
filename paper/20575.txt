Dynamic Prediction Pools: An Investigation of Financial Frictions and Forecasting Performance

ABSTRACT
We provide a novel methodology for estimating time-varying weights in linear prediction pools, which
we call Dynamic Pools, and use it to investigate the relative forecasting performance of DSGE models
with and without financial frictions for output growth and inflation from 1992 to 2011. We find strong
evidence of time variation in the pool's weights, reflecting the fact that the DSGE model with financial
frictions produces superior forecasts in periods of financial distress but does not perform as well in
tranquil periods. The dynamic pool's weights react in a timely fashion to changes in the environment,
leading to real-time forecast improvements relative to other methods of density forecast combination,
such as Bayesian Model Averaging, optimal (static) pools, and equal weights. We show how a
policymaker dealing with model uncertainty could have used a dynamic pools to perform a counterfactual
exercise (responding to the gap in labor market conditions) in the immediate aftermath of the Lehman
crisis.

Introduction

Many macroeconomists paid scant attention to financial frictions models before the recent
Great Recession. As a consequence, most of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) models used by monetary policy-making institutions at the onset of the recession
in 2007 were variants of the Smets and Wouters (2007) (henceforth, SW) model. The SW
model augments the neoclassical stochastic growth model by price and wage rigidities as well
as various adjustment mechanisms, but it has no credit market frictions. The only financial
time series that is used in the estimation of the SW model is the short-term nominal interest
rate, which serves as the monetary policy instrument in the model. Yet financial frictions
mechanisms, e.g. Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Bernanke et al. (1999), that could be built
into estimable DSGE models were available long before the Great Recession. Christiano et al.
(2003) was the first paper to incorporate a credit market friction into a large-scale DSGE
model suitable for prediction and policy analysis. Building on the work of Christiano et al.
(2003) and others, Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013) and Del Negro et al. (Forthcoming)
show that an enlarged SW model with financial frictions (henceforth SWFF) as in Bernanke
et al. (1999) would have done a much better job forecasting the dynamics of real GDP growth
and inflation in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in the fall of 2008.
The left panels of Figure 1, which is taken from Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013), show
real-time forecasts of real GDP growth and GDP deflator inflation obtained in the aftermath
of the Lehman crisis using our version of the SW model without financial frictions (henceforth
SWπ). The figure highlights that this model was blindsided by the subsequent drop in output
and inflation in the last quarter of 2008. The right panels show forecasts obtained using
the financial frictions model SWFF, which is designed to account for real-time information
coming from financial market spreads. The figure suggests that DSGE models with credit
market imperfections might have provided policymakers with a reasonable outlook for the
economy in the aftermath of the crisis. To our knowledge, however, these models were not
used. Why not?
We document that the forecasting performance of the SWFF model is better than that
of the SWπ model during financially turbulent times, but it is worse during tranquil times,
where our measure of forecasting performance throughout the paper is the log predictive
density score for a joint forecast of average output growth and inflation over a period of four

Notes: This figure is taken from Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013). The panels show for each model real time
data on real GDP growth (upper panel) and inflation (GDP deflator, lower panel) (black line); multi-step
(fixed origin) posterior mean forecasts (red line); credible bands from the predictive distributions (shaded
blue areas; these are the 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 percent bands, in decreasing shade); Blue Chip forecasts
(blue diamonds); and the actual realizations according to the May 2011 vintage (black dashed line). All the
data are in quarter-on-quarter percent.

quarters. This evidence is consistent with Stock and Watson (2003), who find using reduced
form models that asset prices are not particularly useful on average in forecasting output and
inflation, and may provide a partial justification for the reliance on DSGE models without
financial frictions prior to the Great Recession. The time-variation in the relative forecasting
performance of these two models, which is a feature more broadly encountered by forecasters
and policymakers dealing with the issue of model uncertainty, raises an important question:
How should the models be combined for real time predictions and policy analysis?
To address this question, we develop a new method of combining predictive densities from

This Version: October 3, 2014

recursively estimated econometric models using time-varying weights. This dynamic linear
prediction pool relies on a sequence of weights that follow an exogenous process, respecting
the constraint that the model weights have to lie on the simplex. Throughout the paper
we focus on the combination of two models (SWπ and SWFF), which means that the timevarying weights correspond to a process λt on the unit interval. Our setup takes the form
of a state-space model, in which a nonlinear state-transition equation determines the law
of motion of λt and the linear combination of the predictive densities obtained from the
two DSGE models provides the measurement equation. A particle filter is used to track
the evolution of λt conditional on the observed data. The law of motion of λt is indexed
by some hyperparameters, which can be integrated out under their posterior distribution at
each forecast origin. Our empirical analysis focuses on the sequence of model weights as well
as the forecast performance of the dynamic prediction pool.
Our paper builds on the growing literature on density forecast combination, and specifically on the work by Hall and Mitchell (2007) and Geweke and Amisano (2011).1 These
authors use the sequence of predictive densities, which measure the likelihood of ex-post outcomes from the perspective of a model’s ex-ante forecast distribution, to construct optimal
linear pools. The pools are optimal in the sense that the weights are chosen to maximize
the pool’s historic forecast performance. If one thinks of models as stocks, and of predictive
densities as returns, the optimal-pool approach can be seen as choosing the weights so to
optimize the portfolio’s historical performance. Because this optimization is performed under the assumption that “in population” the optimal combination weight does not vary over
time, we refer to the resulting prediction pool as static.
Waggoner and Zha (2012) extend the Geweke and Amisano (2011) approach to a setting
in which the combination weights follow a Markov switching process. While Waggoner and
Zha (2012) also emphasize the importance of time-variation in the combination weights, our
approach differs from theirs in several dimensions: First, we are using a smooth autoregressive process for the evolution of the pool’s weights instead of using a Markov-switching
process, allowing for potentially slow (depending on the hyperparameter settings) rather
than drastic changes in the combination weights. Second, Waggoner and Zha (2012) emphasize the joint estimation of model parameters and combination weights, which implies that
1

Our paper is also loosely related to the large body of work on the combination of point forecasts dating

back to a seminal paper by Bates and Granger (1969), and more specifically to the strand of that literature
using time-variation in the weights, e.g., Terui and van Dijk (2002) and Guidolin and Timmermann (2009).

This Version: October 3, 2014

observations in periods in which a model receives little weight, should be heavily discounted
in the estimation of that model’s parameters. While this joint estimation is conceptually
interesting and potentially desirable, we think that it is impractical in the DSGE model
applications that we have in mind. In a typical setting at a policy institution, we think that
it is unrealistic (the candidate models may be maintained by different divisions or modeling groups within the institution) that DSGE models are re-estimated when being pooled.2
Third, and most important, the Waggoner and Zha (2012) approach requires that all models
under consideration share the same set of observables, a requirement that is not met when
the key difference across models is the set of observables, as is the case in many interesting
applications including the one considered here. To justify our inference procedure for the
model parameters we propose a principal-agent framework in which the policymaker has to
aggregate predictive densities that she receives from two DSGE modelers.
We obtain a non-linear state space model and conduct inference about the weights using
a particle filter. As such, our approach bears many similarities to that proposed by Billio
et al. (2013), who discuss time-varying model convolutions. Where we differ from Billio et al.
(2013) is in the specification of the law of motion of the weights. Our setting is designed
to encompass Hall and Mitchell (2007)’s and Geweke and Amisano (2011)’s static pools: as
the hyperparameter characterizing the persistence in the law of motion of λt our procedure
specializes to theirs (except that we determine the combination weight as the mean instead
of the mode of the posterior distribution). Thus, we let the data determine the degree of
time-variation in the weights, via the posterior distribution on the persistence parameter, as
opposed to imposing it a priori as in Billio et al. (2013). In addition, our approach allows
for a prior distribution of the weights that is uniform over [0, 1], thereby making inference
about the pool’s weights arguably more informative about the models’ relative forecasting
performance.
Throughout this paper we focus on linear prediction pools, albeit with time-varying
weights. There also exists a literature on nonlinear pools. For instance, Gneiting and
Ranjan (2013) take beta transformations of cumulative densities from univariate prediction
pools to ensure that the predictive density of the pool is well calibrated. Fawcett et al. (2013)
2

This is certainly the case for medium-scale DSGE models, the application considered here, which in

some cases are not even re-estimated every quarter. For models that are not estimated using full information
methods, e.g. the FRB/US model used at the Board of Governors, the requirement that the model is
re-estimated in light of the information coming from the pool’s weights is simply unfeasible.

let the combination weights depend on the variable that is being forecast and use sieves to
approximate the variable-dependent weights. Exploring these generalizations is beyond the
scope of our paper.
Our empirical application focuses on forecasts of four-quarter-ahead average output
growth and inflation obtained from combinations of the SWπ and the SWFF model. We
compare the weight evolution implied by our dynamic pools to that implied by the static
pool approach and Bayesian model averaging (BMA). We find that after prolonged periods
in which one model performs better than the other, all three approaches – quite naturally –
put more weight on the best-performing model. BMA often goes to the extreme of assigning
weights of 0 and 1 to the competing models, while both the static and the dynamic pool tend
to maintain the benefits of model diversification. BMA and the static pool are characterized
by a slow reaction to reversals in the relative forecasting performance, however. Because
they are caught flat-footed when the environment changes, these procedure perform worse
in terms of real-time accuracy than naive combination procedures such as equal weights.
Conversely, dynamic pool weights can change rapidly, implying limited losses relative to the
equal weights approach when reversals occurs. Because these reversals tend to be persistent,
the dynamic pool eventually outperforms equal weights in our application.
The posterior distribution of the dynamic pool’s hyperparameters is consistent with these
findings. It shows that the data favor the dynamic relative to the static pool, but also that
discrepancies in the forecasting performance tend to be persistent. We also allow for the
unconditional mean of the distribution to be different from equal weights, which is the case
if one model were to be on average better than the other, but the data offer little evidence
in favor of this hypothesis. Finally, the data favor a specification in which the weights’
distribution may shift rapidly away from the unconditional mean.
In terms of the substantive questions motivating this paper, we find that the posterior
distribution of the weights tends to be tilted toward the model without financial friction
during tranquil times, but shifts rapidly in the other direction once financially turbulent
times start. In particular, we show that by the time the Lehman crisis struck the real-time
distribution of λt was putting considerable mass on the SWFF model. We conclude that while
macroeconomists had some reason for not relying exclusively on this model before the crisis,
they had no reason for not relying on it at all. We also perform a counterfactual policy
exercise using the real-time weight distribution available in the aftermath of the Lehman

crisis. We show that a policymaker would have had reasons to switch from the historical
policy Taylor-type rule to a policy that strongly responds to measures of gaps in the labor
market, had she used dynamic pools to address the issue of model uncertainty.
Our findings beg the question of whether they are the consequence of using linearized
DSGE models. A non-linear model with financial friction may look (and forecast) very
much like one without friction in tranquil times, but have very different dynamics when the
financial constraints become binding (e.g., see Brunnermeier and Sannikov (Forthcoming),
Dewachter and Wouters (2012), or the estimated DSGE model of Bocola (2013)). Work
by Alessandri and Mumtaz (2014) on forecasting with regime switching models provides
complementary evidence on the presence of non-linearities.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the pricipal-agent
setting which we use to describe the model combination environment. Section 3 provides a
unified framework for characerizing static model combination procedures such as Bayesian
model averaging and static pools, and sets the stage for the introduction of dynamic pools,
which are described in Section 4. Throughout the paper we focus on the combination of two
DSGE model and leave the extension to more than two model for future research. Section 5
describes the models, the data on which they are estimated, and the evolution in their
forecasting performance for output and inflation over time. Section 6 presents the results
and Section 7 concludes.

A Stylized Principle-Agent Framework

Estimation of large-scale DSGE models can be tedious and computationally costly. In central
banks, this task is typically delegated to (groups of) expert modelers. Each modeling group
builds, estimates, and maintains their model and generates model output that can be used
in the policy-making process, e.g., an account of current and historical events, forecasts, and
policy scenarios. Individuals involved in making policy decisions typically face the problem
of aggregating or pooling the output from different models. In this paper, we focus on
the pooling of density forecasts from two DSGE models. Our general approach is neither
restricted to DSGE models applications nor to the combination of only two models and we
comment on these generalizations in the conclusion.

This Version: October 3, 2014

To characterize the density forecast combination problem, we consider a stylized principleagent framework. In this setting each agent is an econometric modelers who estimates a
DSGE model and uses it to generate density forecasts. We assume that there are two modelers, M1 and M2 , who each maintain their own DSGE model.3 The principal is a policymaker
who aggregates the density forecast of the modelers. The modelers are rewarded based on
the accuracy of their prediction. Both modelers generate predictive densities of the form
m
p(yt |It−1
, Mm ) for a vector yt , t = 1, . . . , T of variables of interest. Let y1:t denote the sem
quence {y1 , .., yt } and note that for each of the two models the information set It−1
may,

in general, be larger than y1:t−1 . For instance, the (model-specific) information sets may
m
m
m
include additional variables z1:t−1
such that It−1
= {y1:t−1 , z1:t−1
} and
m
m
p(yt |It−1
, Mm ) = p(yt |y1:t−1 , z1:t−1
, Mm ).

(1)

In the application in Section 6, yt includes output growth and inflation, zt includes consumption, investment, hours per capita, real wage growth, the federal funds rate, long-run
inflation expectations, for both models, and, in addition, spreads for one of the two models.
m
We assume that the agents are rewarded based on the log predictive score ln p(yt |It−1
, Mm ).

The log predictive score is a proper scoring rule that induces truth telling, i.e., the agents
maximize their expected payoff by reporting the actual predictive density associated with
their model. Moreover, Agent 1’s payoff is independent off the accuracy of the forecast of
Agent 2 (and vice versa) which eliminates strategic interactions. This assumption reflects
the observation that modeling groups in policy-making institutions typically do not take into
account that the output of their model may be combined with the output of other models.
They simply strive to provide the best characterization of the economy obtainable within
their particular modeling framework.
In every period t, the principal receives the predictive densities p(yt+1 |Itm , Mm ) and
combines them using a linear prediction pool
p(yt+1 |ItP , P) = λ̂t p(yt+1 |It1 , M1 ) + (1 − λ̂t )p(yt+1 |It2 , M2 ).

(2)

The remainder of this paper focuses on the construction of the sequence of weights λ̂t . We
assume that the principal’s information set ItP contains the following objects: (i) the sequence

t+1
of actual observations y1:t ; and (ii) the sequence of predictive densities p(ỹτ |Iτm−1 , Mm ) τ =1 ,
3

Because each modeler maintains only one model we use the notation Mm for both modelers and models.

This Version: October 3, 2014

where ỹτ denotes the generic argument of the predictive density function. Based on this

t
information, the principal can evaluate the first t predictive densities p(ỹτ |Iτm−1 , Mm ) τ =1
at the realized value ỹτ = yτ and generate a density forecast for the future (and thus far
unobserved) yt+1 by pooling the modelers’ density forecasts.
In this paper, we propose to compute the weights λ̂t using a method that we refer to as
dynamic prediction pool. Before doing so, we review the computation of λ̂t using Bayesian
model averaging (BMA) and a static prediction pool. For now, we will consider sequences of
one-step-ahead forecasts and postpone the discussion of multi-step forecasts until Section4.3.

Bayesian Model Averaging and Static Pools

The idea of BMA (Section 3.1) is to assign discrete prior probabilities to each model under
consideration and then to update these probabilities based on Bayes Theorem in light of the
data. Predictive distributions for future observations are then generated as a weighted average of the predictive distributions of the individual models. BMA was advocated by Leamer
(1978) as a way to account for model uncertainty. Hoeting et al. (1999) provide a review
of BMA techniques. Forecasting applications in the econometrics literature include, among
others, Min and Zellner (1993) and Wright (2008). Static prediction pools (Section 3.2) can
be viewed as an extension of the classic Bates and Granger (1969) approach of combining
point forecasts to the combination of density forecasts. The basic idea of the Bates-Granger
approach is to construct a linear combination of point forecasts and to use past data to
determine the combination weight that minimizes the mean-squared forecast error of the
combined forecast assuming that the optimal weight is constant over time. (Linear) static
pools are linear combinations of predictive densities with weights estimated by maximizing
the predictive performance of the pool on past observations.
To simplify the exposition, we will start from the assumption that neither modeler includes additional variables ztm in his model and the information sets of the modelers are
simply Itm = y1:t , m = 1, 2. A generalization to larger information sets Itm that might differ
across modelers is provided in Section 3.3. Starting point for both BMA and the static pool
is the assumption that the policymaker combines the predictive densities provided by the
modelers using the following mixture:
p(yt+1 |λ, ItP , P) = λp(yt+1 |y1:t , M1 ) + (1 − λ)p(yt+1 |y1:t , M2 ),

(3)

This Version: October 3, 2014

The main difference between BMA and static pools lies in the assumption about the domain
of λ. Under both approaches, the policymaker has to infer λ based on past observations.

3.1

Bayesian Model Averaging

In the context of our principal-agent setup, the premise of BMA is that the policymaker
believes that one of the two DSGE models is correctly specified but she does not know which
one. Thus, the domain of λ is restricted to take one of the following two values:
λ ∈ {1, 0}.
From the policymaker’s perspective M1 (M2 ) is correct if λ = 1 (λ = 0). In this setup
the joint density of a sequence of observations y1:T , which is called marginal likelihood in
Bayesian analysis, is given by


The policymaker can conduct inference on λ by sequentially updating the probability that

the unknown λ we obtain

Static Pools

Strictly speaking, a policymaker engaging in Bayesian model averaging operates under the
belief that the model space is complete in the sense that one of the two models is correct. He
uses the data to infer which of the two models is the correct one. Alternatively, and probably
more realistically, the policymaker may be concerned that the model space is incomplete and
neither model is correctly specified. This case is depicted in a stylized manner in the top
panel of Figure 2. The figure shows the two DSGE models, represented by p(y1:T |Mm ) and
a generic data generating process (DGP), represented by the density p(y1:T ). The length
of the arrows depicts the Kullback-Leibler (KL) discrepancy between the DGP and two
A
models. The posterior model probability λ̂BM
recursively defined in (6) has the property
T

that under a stable DGP it converges to one almost surely if M1 is closer (in terms of the
A
KL discrepancy) to the DGP than M2 . Vice versa, if M2 is closer to the DGP, λ̂BM
T

converges to zero as T −→ ∞. This basic result have been proved in the literature under
various conditions, e.g., Dawid (1984) or Geweke and Amisano (2011), and it implies that

This Version: October 3, 2014

11

BMA assigns all the weight to a single model.
The optimal static prediction pool approach advocated by Hall and Mitchell (2007) and
Geweke and Amisano (2011) extends the domain of λ from the set {0, 1} to the unit interval
λ ∈ [0, 1], which allows for a convex combination (rather than a selection) of the onestep-ahead predictive densities p(yt |y1:t−1 , M1 ) and p(yt |y1:t−1 , M2 ) in (3). This approach
generalizes (4) to
p(y1:T |λ, P) =

{λp(yt |y1:t−1 , M1 ) + (1 − λ)p(yt |y1:t−1 , M2 )} ,

λ ∈ [0, 1].

A stylized representation of this extension is depicted in the bottom panel of Figure 2. The
dots connecting the end points p(y1:T |M1 ) and p(y1:T |M2 ) represent the models associated
with the likelihood function given in (8). Hall and Mitchell (2007) interpret this approach as
an extension of the Bates and Granger (1969) point forecast combination method to the case
of density forecasts, whereas Geweke and Amisano (2011) view it as a way of implementing
Bayesian inference on an incomplete model space.
To conduct Bayesian inference about the unknown weight λ the policymaker can start
from a prior density p(λ|P) and recursively update the believes about λ based on Bayes

We use the abbreviation BSP for Bayesian static pool. The key difference between BMA
and the static pool is the updating rule for λ̂t . In the former case it is given by (6), whereas
in the latter case it is given by (9) and (11).4
Instead of weighting the model-based predictive density by the posterior mean of λ the
approach proposed in Hall and Mitchell (2007) and Geweke and Amisano (2011) amounts
to defining λ̂t as the mode of p(λ|ItP , P) under a uniform prior distribution p(λ|P), which is
also the argmax of the likelihood function (8). We refer to the resulting pool of densities as
SP
to denote the estimate of
maximum (likelihood) static pool (MSP). Accordingly, we use λ̂M
t

λ and pM SP (yt+1 |ItP , P) to denote the resulting linear prediction pool. Geweke and Amisano
(2011) show that the sequence of pooling weights has the property that it converges to
the value of λ that minimizes the KL distance between the DGP p(Y1:T ) and the family of
distributions p(y1:T |λ, P). Unless, the DGP is identical to either M1 or M2 , the sequences
SP
λ̂BSP
and λ̂M
do not converge to either one or zero as T −→ ∞.

Modelers’ Use of Larger Information Sets

The policymaker may only care about a subset of variables, e.g., output growth and inflation
as in our application, that are used by the modelers to estimate their DSGE models. In other
words, the modelers may use additional variables ztm (in addition to yt ) in their econometric
analysis and these additional variables may differ across modelers. In this case, the formula
in (6) could be justified as follows. In slight abuse of notation, define the vector zt = zt1 ∪ zt2
as the union of the variables contained in zt1 and zt2 and let It = {y1:t , z1:t }. Moreover, assume
that the DSGE models are specified such that additional information through variables in
zt that are not included in the original model specification, do not change the predictive
density in the sense that
m
p(yt |It−1
, Mm ) = p(yt |It−1 , Mm ).

(12)

In our empirical application yt is composed of output growth and inflation, zt1 includes
interest rates, hours worked, consumption growth, investment, and real wage growth. zt2
comprises the zt1 as well as a measure of interest rate spreads. The assumption stated in (12)
4

Of course, in any period t (11) could still be interpreted as observation being generated by

p(yt+1 |y1:t , M1 ) with probability λ̂BSP
and by p(yt+1 |y1:t , M2 ) with probability 1 − λ̂BSP
where these
t
t
probabilities follow a complicated nonlinear law of motion.

implies that modeler M1 would not change his forecast in view of the interest rate spread
series, because she is using a model that is not designed to incorporate this information.
Suppose now that the policymaker’s beliefs about the evolution of zt take the form of
P
a density p(zt |yt , z1:t−1 , It−1
, P). That is, let us say that the policymaker uses “her own”

model to obtain projections for the zt variables because she believes that neither M1 or M2
is suitable for forecasting them (e.g., spreads). Then we can write
P
p(yt , zt |z1:t−1 , λ, It−1
, P)
(13)


P
= λp(yt |y1:t−1 , z1:t−1 , M1 ) + (1 − λ)p(yt |y1:t−1 , z1:t−1 , M2 ) × p(zt |yt , z1:t−1 , It−1
, P).
A
Under BMA, if we let λ̂BM
be the probability of λ = 1 conditional on the extended infort

mation set (z1:t , ItP ), then we can generalize (6) to
A
λ̂BM

.

(14)

Note, however, that the policymaker never explicitly uses the additional information z1:t ,
P
because the density p(zt |yt , z1:t−1 , It−1
, P) does not depend on λ and cancels out in the
A
calculation of λ̂BM
. Thus, as long as the policymaker’s beliefs about the evolution of the
t

zt ’s are independent of whether model M1 or M2 is correct, she could update posterior
probabilities for M1 and M2 based on the predictive densities that she receives from the
models and the information set ItP which excludes z1:t . There is no need to evaluate a
conditional density for zt . A similar argument applies to the static pool, which extends the
P
domain of λ to the unit interval. The information set It−1
in (9) can be replaced by (z1:t , It )

and the density p(zt |·) appears in both the numerator and denominator of (9) and therefore
cancels and does not affect p(λ|z1:t , ItP , P) = p(λ|ItP , P). In other words, if the policymaker
has her own model to forecast zt , then she will use only information from yt to discriminate
between M1 and M2 .

Dynamic Pools

In view of structural changes in the macro economy over the past six decades it is plausible to
let the pooling weight λ evolve over time. Thus, in the remainder of the paper, we focus on a
model combination procedure in which the fixed λ is replaced by a sequence λt , t = 1, 2, . . ..

To simplify the exposition we assume again that It = Itm = y1:t , that is, neither modeler
uses additional variables ztm to estimate the DSGE model. Following the same arguments
as in Section 3.3, everything goes through when the information set is expanded to include
ztm . The policymaker’s likelihood function takes the form
p(y1:T |λ1:T , P) =

4.1

A Stochastic Process Prior for the Model Weights

Expecting the optimal combination weights to exhibit some degree of persistence, we follow
the literature on Bayesian non-parametric function estimation (see, e.g., the survey by Griffin
et al. (2011)) and impose a stochastic-process prior on λ1:T that implies a “smooth” evolution
over time. This prior is indexed by three hyperparameters: ρ controls the persistence of λt , µ
its long-run mean, and σ the shape of the density associated with the marginal distribution
of λt . Let
xt = (1 − ρ)µ + ρxt−1 +
λt = Φ(xt ),

p
1 − ρ2 σεt ,

εt ∼ iid N (0, 1),

x0 ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ),

(16)

This Version: October 3, 2014

15

where Φ(.) is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a N (0, 1) random variable
The law of motion for λt nests several interesting special cases. Suppose that µ = 0 and
σ = 1. In this case the marginal distribution of xt is N (0, 1) and the marginal distribution
of λt is U [0, 1] for each t. The hyperparameter ρ controls the persistence of the xt and
λt processes. The closer ρ is equal to one, the more slowly the weights on the two DSGE
models change. In the limit, if ρ = 1, the dynamic pool reduces to the static pool: λt = λ
for each t and λ ∼ U [0, 1]. Choosing a positive (negative) value of µ shifts the mean of the
unconditional distribution of the model weight λt from 1/2 to one (zero). Finally, if σ < 1,
then the variance of xt is less than one and the probability integral transform based on the
N (0, 1) cdf generates a density for λt with an inverted-U shape, increasing the probability that
both models receive equal weight. Vice versa, values σ > 1 generate a U-shaped density for
λt , increasing the probability that λ is either close to one or to zero. In sum, the process (16)
generates a sequence of priors p(λt |λt−1 , θ, P), where θ stacks the hyperparameters (ρ, µ, σ).

4.2

Posterior Inference

To conduct inference about the sequence of weights λt the policymaker has to combine the
likelihood function (15) with the prior (16). The dynamic pool can be viewed as a nonlinear
state-space model in which λt is the hidden state, (16) describes the state transition, and
the convex combination of time t predictive densities in (3) with λ replaced by λt is the
P
measurement equation. Let p(λt−1 |θ, It−1
, P) denote the posterior distribution of λt−1 given
P
the policymaker’s time t − 1 information set It−1
(which includes y1:t−1 ). The time t fore-

casting step of a nonlinear filter for the state-space model generates the the one-step-ahead
predictive density for λt :

, P)

Z

P

p(λt |θ, λt−1 , P)p(λt−1 |θ, It−1

(17)

The application of Bayes Theorem leads to the policymaker’s posterior distribution of λt and
corresponds to the updating step of a nonlinear filter:
p(λt |θ, ItP , P) =

P
[λt p(yt |y1:t−1 , M1 ) + (1 − λt )p(yt |y1:t−1 , M2 )]p(λt |θ, It−1
, P)
.
P
p(yt |θ, It−1 , P)

(18)

Because of the nonlinearity of the state-space representation of the dynamic pool, we use a
bootstrap particle filter described in detail in Appendix C to approximate the sequence of

densities p(λt |θ, ItP , P ).5 Based on the posterior distribution of λt , we can define

t+1|t (θ)p(yt+1 |y1:t , M1 ) + (1 − λ̂t+1|t )p(yt+1 |y1:t , M2 ).

(20)

The dependence on the hyperparameter θ can be eliminated by integrating out θ using the
posterior distribution p(θ|ItP , P), which is discussed in more detail below.

4.3

Multi-Step Forecasting

Our application focuses on multi-step forecasts of output growth and inflation. Policy makers
are generally more interested in forecasts of average output growth or inflation over the next
h period rather than the growth rates between period t + h − 1 and period t + h. Accordingly,
we define

h

ȳt+h,h =

1X
yt+s
h s=1

(21)

and assume that the policymaker receives the densities p(ȳt+h,h |Itm , Mm ) from the modelers.
To the extent that the policymaker is concerned about the misspecification of the h-step
predictive densities that she receives from the modelers, it is reasonable to adopt a lossfunction-based approach and estimate the sequence of combination weights λt separately
for each horizon h. As is common in the literature on predictive regressions and multi-step
estimation, e.g., Schorfheide (2005) and the references cited therein, we ignore the overlap
between ȳt,h , ȳt−1,h , etc. and assume that the policymaker conducts inference based on a
pseudo-likelihood function of the form

using the same prior distribution as in (16).
In period t the information set ItP of the policymaker consists of the following objects:
(i) the sequence of actual observations ȳ1:t,h ; and (ii) the sequence of predictive densities

{p(ỹτ |Iτm−h , Mm )}tτ =1 at the observed value ỹτ = yt . This leads to a sequence of pseudoposterior distributions p(h) (λt |θ, ItP , P), which are updated according to Bayes Theorem:

manner, using the corresponding pseudo-likelihood function.

and the updating step (23). In order to generate draws from the pseudo-posterior we use
a particle-MCMC technique (see, Andrieu et al. (2010)) that combines a bootstrap particle
filter with a random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and is described in Appendix C.

Further Discussion

We motivated the prediction pool as a linear combination of two predictive densities. Alternatively, the prediction pool could be reinterpreted as a two-state regime switching model.
In fact, Waggoner and Zha (2012) start directly from such an interpretation. To simplify
the exposition, we focus on the case h = 1, µ = 0, and σ = 1. If st = 1 then the yt is given
1
2
by p(yt |It−1
, M1 ) and if st = 2, then p(yt |It−1
, M2 ). The probability of being in state st = 1

is determined by the hidden process xt , and conditional on xt is equal to λt = Φ(xt ). Under
the assumption that µ = 0, and σ = 1 the unconditional probability of being in state st = 1
is

Z
P(st = 1) =

Φ(xt )ϕ(xt )dxt = 1/2,

(30)

where ϕ(·) is the probability density function (pdf) of a N (0, 1) random variable. Conditional
on xt−1 the regime probability is
Z
P(st = 1|xt−1 ) =

Φ(ρxt−1 +

p
1 − ρ2 + t )ϕ(t )dt .

(31)

We can also calculate the probability of staying in regime 1. Using Bayes theorem
Φ(xt−1 )ϕ(xt−1 )
p(xt−1 |st−1 = 1) = R
= 2Φ(xt−1 )ϕ(xt−1 ).
Φ(xt−1 )ϕ(xt−1 )
Therefore,
Z Z
P(st = 1|st−1 = 1) =


p
2
Φ(ρxt−1 + 1 − ρ + t )ϕ(t )dt 2Φ(xt−1 )ϕ(xt−1 )dxt−1 . (32)

However, unlike in the Hamilton (1989)-style Markov regime-switching framework considered
by Waggoner and Zha (2012), our setup does not have a first-order Markov structure in terms
of st , that is, P(st = 1|st−1 , st−2 , . . .) 6= P(st = 1|st−1 = 1). In our setting, higher-order lags
of st provide additional information about the hidden process xt and the probability of
transitioning to st = 1 depends on the entire regime history.6
6

Chang et al. (2014) proposed a regime switching model with an autoregressive factor in which the hidden

state st is directly tied to the latent factor xt through a threshold rule of the form st = I{xt ≥ τ }. Their

Two DSGE Models: Specification, Estimation, and
Forecasting

Our empirical analysis is based on two DSGE models. The first DSGE model, M1 , is a
modified version of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model. The SW model is based on earlier
work by Christiano et al. (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2003). It is a medium-scale DSGE
model, which augments the standard neoclassical stochastic growth model with nominal price
and wage rigidities as well as habit formation in consumption and investment adjustment
costs. We modify the SW model by introducing a time-varying inflation target and including
long-run inflation expectations into the set of observables that is used to estimate the model.
A justification for this modification is provided in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013). We
call the resulting specification SWπ model.
The second DSGE model, M2 , is obtained by adding financial frictions to the SWπ model
and builds on work by Bernanke et al. (1999), Christiano et al. (2003), De Graeve (2008), and
Christiano et al. (Forthcoming). In this DSGE model, banks collect deposits from households
and lend to entrepreneurs who use these funds as well as their own wealth to acquire physical
capital, which is rented to intermediate goods producers. Entrepreneurs are subject to
idiosyncratic disturbances that affect their ability to manage capital. Their revenue may
thus be too low to pay back the bank loans. Banks protect themselves against default
risk by pooling all loans and charging a spread over the deposit rate. This spread various
exogenously due to changes in the riskiness of entrepreneurs’ projects and endogenously as
a function of the entrepreneurs’ leverage. We refer to the second DSGE model as SWFF
model. All ingredients of the SWFF model were publicly available prior to 2008. As such,
the model does not include some of the features that may have been found to be relevant
following the crisis. The formal specification of the two models is presented in Appendix A
The SWπ model is estimated based on quarterly data on U.S. output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, real wage growth, hours worked, inflation, the federal funds
rate, and ten-year ahead inflation expectations. The history of these series generates the information set Itm . The estimation of the SWFF model is based on nine variables: the same
eight time series used for the SWπ model and an additional time series for spreads. In the
empirical analysis we will assume that the policymaker is interested in output growth and
model (unlike our model) is isomorphic to Hamilton’s regime switching model if xt evolves exogenously.

inflation forecasts, which means that the vector yt includes those two series. The remaining
series are part of the vectors zt1 and zt2 , respectively. Precise data definitions are provided in
Appendix B.
Our empirical analysis is based on the real-time data set constructed in Del Negro and
Schorfheide (2013). This data set reconstructs the actual information sets available to modelers on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st of each year, accounting for the
fact that the macroeconomic time series have subsequently been revised by the statistical
agencies. Due to the real-time analysis, the definition of the information sets Itm requires
some care. We consider four forecasts per year, corresponding to the information set available to the modelers on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st of each year. An
example of the timing convention for 2009 is given in Table 1. For instance, on January
1st 2009, the modelers have NIPA data available until 2008:Q3. At this point in time, a
preliminary estimate for 2008:Q4 has not yet been published.
When plotting results over time we use the convention that t equals the quarter corresponding to the latest NIPA data. Thus, t would correspond to 2008:Q3 for forecasts
made on January 1st 2009. In turn, the horizon h = 1 corresponds to a “nowcast” of the
fourth quarter of 2008. While NIPA data for our forecast origins are only available with
a one-quarter delay, financial data are available in real time. In our empirical analysis we
will distinguish between unconditional and semi-conditional forecasts. The unconditional
forecasts are based on the information set Itm that use financial data only up to the same
quarter (t) for which NIPA data are available. The semi-conditional forecasts are based on
the information set Itm+ , which includes the t + 1 federal funds rate and spreads in addition to
Itm . For instance, on January 1st 2009, the semi-conditional forecasts use financial variables

from 2008:Q4. All of the subsequent results are based on the semi-conditional forecasts, if
not otherwise explicitly indicated, because that is the natural information set for a forecaster.
Both DSGE models are recursively estimated using Bayesian techniques. A summary of
the prior distribution is provided in Table A-1 of Appendix A. A detailed discussion of the
prior can be found in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013). Each estimation sample starts in
1964:Q1. Our forecast origins (and hence the endpoints of the estimation samples) range
from 1992:Q1 to 2011:Q2. In order to pool the DSGE model forecasts, the policymaker
needs to receive the predictive densities p(ȳt+h,h |Itm , Mm ) (or p(ȳt+h,h |Itm+ , Mm )) from the
modelers. The computation of these densities is described in Appendix C.
Figure 4 depicts the log scores p(ȳt+h,h |Itm+ , Mm ) (semi-conditional forecasts) for the
predictions of four-quarter-ahead (h = 4) average output growth and inflation for the SWπ
(blue) and the SWFF (red) model. The forecast origins range from 1992:Q1 to 2011:Q2.
These scores are subsequently used as the inputs for the policymaker’s density combination.
Two features of Figure 4 are apparent. First, the financial frictions model grossly outperform
the SWπ model during the recent financial crisis, which is not surprising in light of Figure 1.
Second, the relative forecasting performance of the two models varies over time, with the
SWFF outperforming the SWπ model during periods of financial turmoil, such as the early2000s dot-com bust and the Great Recession, and the opposite occurring during more tranquil
periods. Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013) report similar findings using 12-periods moving

Results from the Dynamic Prediction Pool

We now apply the dynamic pools methodology discussed in Section 6 to the forecasts of
four-quarter-ahead average output growth and inflation obtained from the SWπ model and
the SWFF model. We ask the following questions: How do the weights assigned to the two
DSGE models by the Bayesian dynamic pool (DP) procedure evolve over time and how do
the DP weights compare to those obtained from BMA or the static pool (MSP) (Section 6.1)?
In particular, do the DP weights change rapidly enough when estimated in real time to offer
useful guidance to policymakers and/or forecasters? How do the hyperparameters of the
DP procedure affect the speed of reaction to changes in the relative forecasting performance
of the component models (Section 6.2)? How do the various pooling procedures perform
in terms of real-time forecasting accuracy (Section 6.3)? Finally, how can a policymaker
use the DP procedure to perform a counterfactual policy analysis (Section 6.4)? While we
use the semi-conditional forecast to compute the forecast accuracy statistics as well as in
the estimation of the combination weights, we sometimes drop the ‘+’ superscript in t+ to

Pooling Weights

We documented in Section 5 that there is no dominant model in the race between SWFF and
SWπ, and that there are medium-frequency swings in the relative forecasting performance
of the two models. Arguably, this is a common situation in model-based forecasting. How
do the various model combination techniques described in Sections 3 and 4 deal with these
features? To what extent does the weight given to a model approach one after a fairly long
period in which this model has been dominant? And how quickly does this weight change
as the relative performance reverses?
7

Similarly, Kolasa and Rubaszek (2013) show that in normal times DSGE models without financial

frictions perform better than models with frictions in normal times. However, they also find that models
with frictions in the housing market perform better in forecasting during the Great Recession than models
with standard financial frictions like the one considered here – a result that deserves further study.

Figure 5: Weights in Real Time: Dynamic Pool, BMA, and Static Pool

Notes: The figure shows the weight on the SWFF model in forecast pools, computed using real time information only, over the period 1992:Q1-2011:Q2 for three different pooling techniques: dynamic pool (λ̂DP
t+h|t
SP

– black), (maximum likelihood) static pool (λ̂M
– purple), and BMA (λ̂BM
– green). Prior 1 is used for

Figure 5 shows the weight on the SWFF model in forecast pools over the period 1992:Q12011:Q2 obtained from the proposed dynamic pooling technique (λ̂DP
t+h|t – black) as well as the
SP
A
static pool (λ̂M
– purple) with weights estimated by maximum likelihood, and BMA (λ̂BM

– green). All of the weights and the hyperparameter estimates for the DP are computed in
real time, based on information that would have been available to the policymaker at the
time of the combination of the model forecasts. The DP weights reported in the figure are
based on the following prior distribution for the hyperparameter vector θ:
Hyperparameter Prior 1: ρ ∼ U[0, 1],

µ = 0,

σ = 1.

(33)

Under this prior distribution, the marginal distribution of λt is also U[0, 1].
By construction, the DP weight of the SWFF model starts close to 0.5 at the beginning of
the sample. The weight falls through the 1990s because the SWπ model forecasts better than
SWFF, but the drop is not very rapid because the log score differential is not substantial. As
soon as the relative forecasting performance of the SWπ and the SWFF model flips around
1999 (see Figure 4) the DP weight starts rising rapidly. The weight on the SWFF model
peaks in 2003 after a five year period in which the financial friction model outperformed the
SWπ model. From 2004 to 2006 the relative ranking of the forecasts is reversed and the

This Version: October 3, 2014

24

weight on the SWFF model from around 0.7 to 0.4. Due to the poor forecast performance
of the SWπ model during the Great Recession, the weight of the SWFF model increases to
0.8 by 2010 and stayed there until the end of our sample period in 2011:Q2.
The MSP weights of the static pool evolve markedly different from the DP weights in the
first half of the sample and exhibit a bang-bang behavior for the first ten years. In part this
is the consequence of using the model rather than the mean of the posterior distribution of
SP
λ to form the combination weights. After 2002 movements in the static pool weights λ̂M
t
DP
M SP
mirror those in λ̂DP
. For
t+h|t with two differences. First, λ̂t+h|t moves more rapidly than λ̂t

example, starting in 2008 λ̂DP
t+h|t drifts upwards toward the SWFF model faster than the SP
M SP
weight. Second, movements in λ̂DP
. As
t+h|t tend to exhibit less inertia than those in λ̂t
SP
the difference in forecasting performance narrows by the end of 2009, for example, λ̂M
t

continues to rise while λ̂DP
t+h|t has stopped increasing. In general the MSP weights react more
sluggishly to new information because the assumption of constant weights implies that the
historical forecast performance is not discounted as strongly as in the dynamic combination
approach.
The BMA weight behaves as expected from the discussion in Section 3.1: as soon as
enough information accumulates in the tranquil 1990s that the SWπ model fares better
than its competitor, the SWFF weight approaches zero and remains there for almost four
years. Around 2002, after almost two years in which SWπ was outperformed by SWFF,
the weight rapidly shifts to the opposite extreme, reaching one by the end of 2002. Except
for a small drop in 2006, the BMA weight of the SWFF stays close to one until the end
of the sample. As a robustness check, we also compute the evolution of the BMA weights
for the unconditional forecasts that do not use any current quarter information about the
A
financial variables. Under this scenario, λ̂BM
is close to zero before the financial crisis, in
t

spite of the fact that the log scores of the two models are not very different than those shown
in Figure 4. This finding illustrates the well known lack of robustness of BMA weights:
minor changes in model or data specification can lead to very different outcomes in terms
of marginal likelihood comparisons. Figures A-2 and A-3 in Appendix D provide further
details.
In order to understand the difference between the behavior of the combination procedures,
it is instructive to look at the entire posterior distribution of the weights. The two panels
(h)

(h)

of Figure 6 show the posterior distributions pDP (λt |ItP , P) and pBSP (λ|ItP , P), respectively.

Notes: The two panels show the posterior distributions pDP (λt |ItP , P) (dynamic) and pBSP (λ|ItP , P), respectively, for t =1992:Q1-2011:Q2. Prior 1 is used for the DP specification: ρ ∼ U[0, 1], µ = 0, σ = 1.

There is no separate panel for BMA, because, in a nutshell, BMA takes the posterior mass
(h)

of pBSP (λ|ItP , P) and allocates it to the endpoints λ = 0 and λ = 1. Under both posterior
distributions the probability mass is fairly uniformly allocated to the unit interval prior to
M SP
1997. During this period the main difference in the weights λ̂DP
stems from
t+h|t and λ̂t

the fact that the former is computed as posterior mean, whereas the latter is computed as
(h)

posterior mode. The mode of pBSP (λ|ItP , P) exhibits a large swing from λ = 1 to λ = 0 in
1996. After 2000, two features of the SP distribution emerge. First, the mass is rather tightly
(h)

concentrated around the mode. For instance, at the end of the sample pBSP (λ|ItP , P) puts
(h)

virtually no mass on {λ ≤ .5}. Second, the distribution pBSP (λ|ItP , P) moves sluggishly over
time: under static pools, new information has only a small effect on the overall distribution.
Starting in 1998, the posterior distribution of λt (dynamic pool) looks very different
from the posterior of λ (static pool). While the latter is concentrated around the mean,
the former is characterized by a “sloshing” of the mass from one side to the other mirroring
the alternations in the relative forecasting performance shown in Figure 4. In all periods
but those of transition, the marginal distribution of λt is similar to that depicted in Figure
3, in that it tilts in one direction or another (the mode distribution is either one or zero)
depending on which model has been the best forecaster in recent periods. Loosely speaking,
we can think of the distribution as a seesaw, whose slope depends on the recent gap in log
scores between the two models. A narrowing of the gap leads to a flattening of the seesaw,

This Version: October 3, 2014

26

shifting the mean toward equal weights, and a reversal of the gap causes the seesaw to tilt
in the opposite direction. The frequency and speed of the oscillations in the seesaw, and
its fulcrum, depend on the hyperparameters ρ, µ, and σ introduced in Section 4.1, whose
posterior distribution we are going to discuss next.

6.2

How Dynamic Is the Dynamic Pool? A Look at the Hyperparameter Estimates

The law of motion for λt is based on three hyperparameters: ρ, σ, and µ. We will now
discuss the role of these hyperparameters and their posterior estimates, starting with the
most important one: ρ. To continue with the seesaw analogy, ρ affects the frequency of the
seesaw oscillations. If ρ is close to zero, the seesaw’s slope is only determined by the disparity
in log scores in the current period. As ρ increases, the changes in relative performance of
the two models have to become persistent in order to alter the seesaw’s inclination. In other
words, ρ determines the “forgetting factor” of dynamic pools. As ρ approaches one, there is
no discounting of past information and dynamic pool turns into a (Bayesian) static pools.
The first set of results is based on the prior in (33). The left panel of Figure 7 shows
the end-of-sample (t = T ) posterior p(h) (ρ|ITP , P) (histogram) together with the U[0, 1] prior
for ρ (red line). As one might have expected, the posterior distribution concentrates around
relative high values of ρ, indicating that the distribution of the weights does not react much
to temporary changes in log scores. The mode of the posterior is between 0.8 and 0.9, with
most of the mass being in the [0.75, 0.95] interval. Importantly, the mass drops rapidly as
ρ approaches one, suggesting that the data do not favor a static pool over the proposed
dynamic pool. The posterior distribution p(h) (ρ|ItP , P) evolves over time. Until 1998 the
posterior of ρ is fairly flat, but subsequently most of the probability mass shifts toward the
interval [0.75, 0.95]. After 2004 the general shape of the posterior stays very similar but
the concentration of probability mass continues until the end of the sample as shown in
Figure A-4 in Appendix D. The Appendix also documents the effect of shifting prior mass
toward one by considering Beta distributions for ρ with (mean, standard deviation) of (0.8,
0.1) and (0.9, 0.2), respectively.
The center panel of Figure 7 focuses on the hyperparameter σ 2 , which affects the shape
of the marginal distribution of λt . As discussed in Section 4.1, σ = 1 implies a uniform

ρ ∼ U[0, 1], µ = 0, σ = 1 (left panel); Prior 2 is ρ ∼ B(0.8, 0.1), µ ∼ N (0, Φ−1 (0.75)), σ 2 ∼ IG(2, 1) (center
and right panel).

prior for the weight λt (regardless of ρ, as long as µ = 0). Values of σ less than one imply a
unimodal (inverse-U shaped) prior for λt that peaks at equal weights (or Φ−1 (µ) if µ 6= 0).
Values of σ greater than one, on the other hand, generate a prior that is U-shaped. The Ushaped prior leads to a convex posterior density (as opposed to the linear posterior obtained
by combining a uniform prior distribution with the linear likelihood function depicted in
Figure 3). The convexity of the posterior implies that the mean is shifted toward one of the
endpoints (λt = 0 or λt = 1). In the context of the seesaw metaphor, σ < 1 is equivalent to
putting weight on the fulcrum, thereby limiting oscillations. Vice versa, σ > 1 favors sharper
changes in the posterior mean of λt .
The center panel of Figure 7 is based on the hyperparameter prior distribution8

favor a parameterization in which the posterior mean is more sensitive to the arrival of new
information.
Finally, the hyperparameter µ determines the location of the seesaw fulcrum, which
corresponds to equal weights on both models if µ = 0. The right panel of Figure 7, which is
also based on Prior 2 in (34), shows the prior and posterior distributions of Φ(µ) – that is, µ
mapped into the space of the model weight λ. The prior is µ ∼ N (0, Φ−1 (0.75)): translated
into the unit interval, this prior is centered at equal weights on both DSGE models and
assigns a probability of approximately 68% to the interval [0.25, 0.75] Interestingly, in spite
of the disparity in log scores between the two models during the Great Recession, the data
are not very informative as to whether one model is better than the other on average. The
end-of-sample t = T posterior of Φ(µ) is slightly shifted toward one relative to the prior, but
nonetheless assigns substantial probability to weights less than 0.5.
Figure 8 shows the effect of estimating the hyperparameters µ and σ on the evolution
of the posterior mean λ̂DP
t+h|t . The figure compares the weight on the SWFF under Prior 1
in (33) and Prior 2 in (34). The swings of λ̂DP
t+h|t are more pronounced under Prior 2 than
under Prior 1. As discussed above, under Prior 2 the posterior distribution of σ assigns most
of its mass to values greater than one, which amplifies the movements in the evolution of
the model weights.

The Dynamic Pool’s Forecasting Performance

After examining the evolution of model weights under dynamic pooling, static pooling, and
BMA, we now turn to the real time forecast performance. Does the dynamic pool of DSGE
models generate more accurate density forecasts than the static pool or the posterior weighted
model average? The answer is a qualified yes in our application: the dynamic pool fares
significantly better than the static pool (with maximum likelihood weights) and BMA. The
dynamic pool is also more accurate than a model average with time-invariant equal weights,
but the accuracy difference is smaller. Throughout, we measure forecast accuracy in terms
of log predictive score differentials.
The left panel of Figure 9 compares the log score of the dynamic pool (black line) over time
to that of its two components: the SWFF model (red) and SWπ model (blue). Recall that the
forecasts are generated based on an information set that includes current interest rates and
(h)

spreads (denoted by ItP+ ). The log predictive score of the dynamic pool, ln pDP (ȳt+h,h |ItP+ , P),
lies in between the score of the two DSGE models. Importantly, in most time periods the
dynamic pool’s log score is in close proximity to that of the best performing DSGE model.
In particular, during the Great Recession, when SWπ performs poorly in terms of forecast
(h)

accuracy, ln pDP (ȳt+h,h |ItP+ , P) closely tracks the log predictive score of the DSGE model
with financial frictions.
How does the dynamic pool compare to other forecast combination methods? The right
panel of Figure 9 shows the log predictive score differences between the dynamic pool and the
following alternatives: BMA (green area), maximum likelihood static pools (purple area),
and equal weights (black line). Positive differentials favor the dynamic pool. A comparison
of the left and right panels is very instructive to understand the forecasting performance
of the various procedures. In the early part of the sample there are no major differences
in forecasting performance. However, around the time of the dot-com bust in early 2000,
large forecast performance differentials arise. Following the long period in which SWπ is
the dominant model both BMA and MSP are caught off guard by the change in regime.
DP is caught off guard as well, as evidenced by the fact that it is forecasting worse than
equal weights, but not as much and most importantly for not as long, given that it reacts
quickly by increasing the weight on the financial friction model (recall Figure 5). In fact,
DP performs better than equal weights in the last part of the dot-com bust period.

BMA (ln pBM A (ȳt+h,h |ItP+ , P), green area), maximum likelihood static pool (ln pM SP (ȳt+h,h |ItP+ , P), purple

σ 2 ∼ IG(2, 1).

This episode offers two lessons for model combination. First, static approaches are not
robust to regime changes, which is perhaps a key reason for why they have been found to
perform worse than equal weights (see Amisano and Geweke (2013)). Second, the equal
weights approach can be outperformed as long as there are persistent periods where one
model is dominant. During these periods the dynamic pool adjusts to put more weight on
the dominant model, and therefore performs better than equal weights. This is precisely
what happens also at the end of the Great Recession period, when DP outperforms equal
weights. During this period BMA gains an advantage from the fact that its weight on the
SWFF model is close to one (but as we discussed earlier, this result is not robust to a
switch from semi-conditional to unconditional forecasts). The log score difference between
the dynamic and the static pool during the recession is relatively modest.
Table 2 shows the cumulative log scores for three specifications of the dynamic pool, as
well as the difference between the dynamic pools cumulative log scores and that of equal
weights, BMA, and the (maximum likelihood) static pool, respectively. These results can be
summarized as follows. First, there is not a major difference among the three dynamic pool
specifications. Estimating σ 2 leads to a roughly one log point improvement in forecasting

performance (recall that the weights react faster to a change in the environment because the
estimated σ is greater than one). On the other hand, the parameter µ – that is, allowing
for the fact that one of the model can be better on average than the other – does not seem
to improve the forecast performance. The dynamic pools outperform both BMA and the
static pool by a substantial margin: the differences are larger than four log points. The
gain relative to the combination based on equal weights, however, is modest. The log score
differentials range from 1.3 to 2.3 log points.

Policy Experiments Under Model Uncertainty

Forecasting is not the only reason to study model combination. Models in general, and
DSGE models in particular, can be used for counterfactual policy analysis. To the extent
that projected outcomes differ across models, the question arises on how to best combine
these projections. Our dynamic pool provides a natural framework for the combination of
models in a counterfactual analysis. In this section we provide an illustrative example of
how the dynamic pool could have been used to study the effect of switching to a different
monetary policy rule during the financial crisis.
In both the SWFF model and the SWπ model monetary policy is represented by an

including the policy rule coefficients.
Our counterfactual experiment studies the effect on output and inflation of replacing the
estimated policy rule (35) by the following rule:
Rt = ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) (ψ1 (πt − πt∗ ) + 0.2Lt ) + rtm .

(36)

Here Lt is hours worked in deviation from steady state. Under this alternative rule, the central bank responds directly to labor market conditions instead of indirectly through aggregate
output. In the counterfactual analysis, we use the posterior estimates for the coefficients ρR
and ψ1 and fix the response to hours worked at 0.2. The rationale for considering (36) is
that in 2012 the policymakers did make the policy instrument explicitly contingent on the
state of the labor market.9 We therefore ask what would have happened to output and inflation had the policymaker immediately after the Lehman crisis considered targeting labor
market conditions. Specifically, we use January 1, 2009 (i.e, the information set includes
NIPA data until 2008:Q3 as well as financial data from 2008:Q4) as the forecast origin for
this counterfactual.
Actual and counterfactual predictions for output growth and inflation are depicted in
Figure 10.10 Each panel shows two predictive densities: one of them is obtained under the
estimated policy rule (blue) and one obtained under the counterfactual policy rule (red).
A comparison of the first and second row of the figure indicates that the SWFF model
and the SWπ model generate vastly different output growth and inflation forecasts based
on the 2008:Q3 macroeconomic data. The actual values of output and inflation during
the forecast period are depicted with vertical dashed lines. Under the SWFF model the
actual outcomes, depicted with vertical dashed lines, are not too far from the mode of the
predictive distribution, as shown by the blue distributions in the top row of Figure 10. Under
the baseline monetary policy, the financial friction DSGE model only slightly overpredicts

According to the December 2012 FOMC statement: “If the outlook for the labor market does not

improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed
securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context
of price stability.” The policy instruments considered in this quote was large scale asset purchases, whose
effects we do not incorporate in the models considered here. For this reason we consider the short term rate
as the policy instrument for this experiment.

We do not show the projections for the federal funds rate, but we note that for both models the interest

four-quarter average output growth and inflation after the Lehman crisis. The SWπ model,
on the other hand, generates a forecast that severely overpredicts the actuals. For instance,
while the posterior predictive distribution of output growth peaks at about 4.5% actual
output growth was less than -3% over the forecast period.
The predicted effect of the counterfactual policy on output growth is qualitatively similar
across the two models: output growth increases and the predictive distribution becomes a bit
more diffuse. The shift of the predictive distribution is more pronounced under the financial
frictions model than under SWπ. The effect of the change in policy rule on inflation, however,
is quite different. Under the SWFF model inflation rises by about 100 basis points, but the
dispersion of the predictive density remains roughly constant. The SWπ model, on the other
hand, predicts that inflation might fall relative to the baseline policy rule, but the outcome
is much more uncertain, i.e., the predictive density is much more spread out. In the SWπ
model, both price and wage markup shocks are important determinants of inflation in the
(see Smets and Wouters (2007) and King and Watson (2012)). Policies that respond very
strongly to the level of the gap in economic activity fare very poorly in terms of controlling
inflation when faced with markup shocks (see Chung et al. (2014)), as these shocks move
activity and inflation in opposite directions. The counterfactual policy (36) is one such
policy, which explains the diffuse predictive distribution of inflation. Conversely, in the
SWFF model markup shocks do not play as large a role as in the SWπ model, as discussed
in Del Negro et al. (Forthcoming), and therefore the predictive distribution of inflation is
not nearly as dispersed.
How can a policymaker aggregate such disparate predictions arising from multiple models? The bottom row of Figure 10 plots predictive distributions for our proposed dynamic
prediction pool. By the end of 2008, the weights on the two DSGE models in the dynamic
pool are approximately 50% each. At the end of 2008, the dynamic pool generates a bimodal predictive distribution for output growth and inflation, which is a reflection of the
the rather different predictive densities obtained from the component models. Because both
DSGE model predict a stimulative effect on output, under the counterfactual policy the
predictive distribution for output growth shifts to the right and the right tail of the distribution lengthens. More interestingly, the predictive distribution for inflation turns from
being bimodal under the estimated policy rule to being unimodal (centered around 1.5%)
and fat-tailed under the counterfactual policy. Given a loss function that is specified in terms

This Version: October 3, 2014

35

of output growth and inflation, the policymaker could use the predictive distributions from
the dynamic pool to choose between the two policy rules.

Conclusion

This paper provides a methodology for estimating time-varying weights for linear prediction
pools. In our application we combine predictive densities from two DSGE models, with
and without financial frictions. However, the same method could be used to combine other
classes of time series models and it could be extended to the combination of more than two
models. We introduce an informational friction to justify not estimating the combination
weights and DSGE model weights jointly. Given the computational difficulties with generating draws from posterior distributions of large-scale DSGE models as well as the institutional
arrangements within central banks, we think that this framework is attractive.
In our empirical analysis we find that the model weights in the dynamic pool vary substantially over time. In times without financial distress the SWπ model forecasts output
growth and inflation more accurately than the DSGE model with financial frictions. This
ranking changes, however, in more turbulent times such as the dot-com bust in early 2000
and the Great Recession in 2007-09. The model weights of the dynamic pool adjust accordingly and the resulting model mixture forecasts (almost) as well as the best (among
the two) DSGE model. These results suggest that our dynamic pool may be viewed as an
approximation of a more elaborate nonlinear DSGE model that inherits the dynamics of the
SWπ model during financial tranquility and the dynamics of the financial frictions model
during turbulent financial times.

Detailed Description of DSGE Models

A.1

Model 1: The Smets-Wouters Model with Time-Varying Inflation Target (SWπ)

Model Specification. We use a slightly modified version of the Smets and Wouters (2007)
model. Following Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013), we detrend the non-stationary model
variables by a stochastic rather than a deterministic trend. This approach makes it possible
to express almost all equilibrium conditions in a way that encompasses both the trendstationary total factor productivity process in Smets and Wouters (2007), as well as the
case where technology follows a unit root process. Let z̃t be the linearly detrended log
productivity process which follows the autoregressive law of motion
z̃t = ρz z̃t−1 + σz εz,t .

(A-1)

1

We detrend all non stationary variables by Zt = eγt+ 1−α z̃t , where γ is the steady state growth
rate of the economy. The growth rate of Zt in deviations from γ, denoted by zt , follows the
process:
zt = ln(Zt /Zt−1 ) − γ =

1
1
(ρz − 1)z̃t−1 +
σz z,t .
1−α
1−α

(A-2)

All variables in the following equations are expressed in log deviations from their nonstochastic steady state. Steady state values are denoted by ∗-subscripts and steady state
formulas are provided in the technical appendix of Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013). The
consumption Euler equation is given by:
ct = −

where ct is consumption, Lt is labor supply, Rt is the nominal interest rate, and πt is inflation.
The exogenous process bt drives a wedge between the intertemporal ratio of the marginal
utility of consumption and the riskless real return Rt −IE t [πt+1 ], and follows an AR(1) process
with parameters ρb and σb . The parameters σc and h capture the degree of relative risk
aversion and the degree of habit persistence in the utility function, respectively. The following
condition expresses the relationship between the value of capital in terms of consumption qtk
and the level of investment it measured in terms of consumption goods:

qtk = S 00 e2γ (1 + β̄) it −

(A-4)

which is affected by both investment adjustment cost (S 00 is the second derivative of the
adjustment cost function) and by µt , an exogenous process called the “marginal efficiency
of investment” that affects the rate of transformation between consumption and installed
capital. The exogenous process µt follows an AR(1) process with parameters ρµ and σµ . The
parameter β̄ = βe(1−σc )γ depends on the intertemporal discount rate in the utility function
of the households β, the degree of relative risk aversion σc , and the steady-state growth rate
γ.
The capital stock, k̄t , evolves as

(A-6)

where rtk is the rental rate of capital, r∗k its steady state value, and δ the depreciation rate.
Given that capital is subject to variable capacity utilization ut , the relationship between k̄t
and the amount of capital effectively rented out to firms kt is
kt = ut − zt + k̄t−1 .

(A-7)

The optimality condition determining the rate of utilization is given by
1−ψ k
r = ut ,
ψ t

(A-8)

Appendix

A-3

where ψ captures the utilization costs in terms of foregone consumption. Real marginal costs
for firms are given by
mct = wt + αLt − αkt ,

(A-9)

where wt is the real wage and α is the income share of capital (after paying markups and
fixed costs) in the production function. From the optimality conditions of goods producers
it follows that all firms have the same capital-labor ratio:
kt = wt − rtk + Lt .

(A-10)

The production function is:
yt = Φp (αkt + (1 − α)Lt ) + I{ρz < 1}(Φp − 1)

(A-11)

z̃t drops out if

are proportional to the trend. Similarly, the resource constraint is:

consumption and labor, and is given by:
wth =

1 − he

(A-15)

where νl characterizes the curvature of the disutility of labor (and would equal the inverse
of the Frisch elasticity in absence of wage rigidities). The mark-ups λf,t and λw,t follow
exogenous ARMA(1,1) processes
λf,t = ρλf λf,t−1 + σλf ελf ,t + ηλf σλf ελf ,t−1 , and
λw,t = ρλw λw,t−1 + σλw ελw ,t + ηλw σλw ελw ,t−1 ,
respectively. Finally, the monetary authority follows a generalized feedback rule:


Rt = ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) ψ1 πt + ψ2 (yt − ytf )


+ ψ3 (yt −

ytf )

− (yt−1 −

f
yt−1
)



+ rtm , (A-16)

where the flexible price/wage output ytf is obtained from solving the version of the model
without nominal rigidities (that is, Equations (A-3) through (A-12) and (A-15)), and the
residual rtm follows an AR(1) process with parameters ρrm and σrm .
In order to capture the rise and fall of inflation and interest rates in the estimation
sample, we replace the constant target inflation rate by a time-varying target inflation. The
interest-rate feedback rule of the central bank (A-16) is modified as follows


Rt = ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) ψ1 (πt − πt∗ ) + ψ2 (yt − ytf )


f
+ψ3 (yt − ytf ) − (yt−1 − yt−1
) + rtm .

(A-17)

The time-varying inflation target evolves according to:
∗
πt∗ = ρπ∗ πt−1
+ σπ∗ π∗ ,t ,

(A-18)

where 0 < ρπ∗ < 1 and π∗ ,t is an iid shock. We model πt∗ as following a stationary process, although our prior for ρπ∗ will force this process to be highly persistent. A detailed
justification of this modification of the policy rule is provided in Del Negro and Schorfheide
(2013).

Appendix

A-5

Model Solution and State-Space Representation. We use the method in Sims (2002)
to solve the log-linear approximation of the DSGE model. We collect all the DSGE model
parameters in the vector θ, stack the structural shocks in the vector t , and derive a statespace representation for our vector of observables yt . The state-space representation is
comprised of the transition equation:
st = T (θ)st−1 + R(θ)t ,

(A-19)

which summarizes the evolution of the states st , and the measurement equation:
yt = Z(θ)st + D(θ),

(A-20)

which maps the states onto the vector of observables yt , where D(θ) represents the vector of
steady state values for these observables.
The measurement equations for real output, consumption, investment, and real wage
growth, hours, inflation, and interest rates are given by:
Output growth = γ + 100 (yt − yt−1 + zt )
Consumption growth = γ + 100 (ct − ct−1 + zt )
Investment growth = γ + 100 (it − it−1 + zt )
Real Wage growth = γ + 100 (wt − wt−1 + zt ) ,
Hours = ¯l + 100lt

(A-21)

Inflation = π∗ + 100πt
FFR = R∗ + 100Rt
where all variables are measured in percent, where π∗ and R∗ measure the steady state level
of net inflation and short term nominal interest rates, respectively and where ¯l captures the
mean of hours (this variable is measured as an index). To incorporate information about
low-frequency movements of inflation the set of measurement equations (A-21) is augmented
by

where πtO,40 represents observed long run inflation expectations obtained from surveys (in
percent per quarter), and the right-hand-side of (A-22) corresponds to expectations obtained

Appendix

A-6

from the DSGE model (in deviation from the mean π∗ ). The second line shows how to compute these expectations using the transition equation (A-19) and the measurement equation
for inflation. Z(θ)(π,.) is the row of Z(θ) in (A-20) that corresponds to inflation. The SWπ
model is estimated using the observables in expressions (A-21) and (A-22).

A.2

Model 2: Smets-Wouters Model with Financial Frictions (SWFF)

Model Specification. We now add financial frictions to the SW model building on the
work of Bernanke et al. (1999), Christiano et al. (2003), De Graeve (2008), and Christiano
et al. (Forthcoming). In this extension, banks collect deposits from households and lend to
entrepreneurs who use these funds as well as their own wealth to acquire physical capital,
which is rented to intermediate goods producers. Entrepreneurs are subject to idiosyncratic
disturbances that affect their ability to manage capital. Their revenue may thus be too low
to pay back the bank loans. Banks protect themselves against default risk by pooling all
loans and charging a spread over the deposit rate. This spread may vary as a function of the
entrepreneurs’ leverage and their riskiness. Adding these frictions to the SW model amounts
to replacing equation (A-6) with the following conditions:
h
i

k
Et R̃t+1
− Rt = bt + ζsp,b qtk + k̄t − nt + σ̃ω,t

R̃tk − πt =

k
rtk + k
qtk − qt−1
,
k
r∗ + (1 − δ)
r∗ + (1 − δ)

(A-23)

(A-24)

where R̃tk is the gross nominal return on capital for entrepreneurs, nt is entrepreneurial
equity, and σ̃ω,t captures mean-preserving changes in the cross-sectional dispersion of ability
across entrepreneurs (see Christiano et al. (Forthcoming)) and follows an AR(1) process with
parameters ρσω and σσω . The second condition defines the return on capital, while the first
one determines the spread between the expected return on capital and the riskless rate.11
The following condition describes the evolution of entrepreneurial net worth:


(A-25)

Note that if ζsp,b = 0 and the financial friction shocks σ̃ω,t are zero, (A-23) and (A-24) coincide with

(A-6).

The corresponding measurement equation is
h

Spread = SP∗ + 100IE t R̃t+1

(A-26)

where the parameter SP∗ measures the steady state spread.

A.3

Prior Distribution

The prior distributions for the SWπ and the SWFF model are summarized in Table A-1.
The joint prior distribution is obtained as the product of the marginals listed in the table.
This prior is then truncated to ensure that for each parameter in the support of the prior
the linearized DSGE model has a unique stable rational expectations equilibrium.

Notes: Smets and Wouters (2007) original prior is a Gamma(.62, .10). The following parameters are fixed
in Smets and Wouters (2007): δ = 0.025, g∗ = 0.18, λw = 1.50, εw = 10, and εp = 10. In addition, for the
model with financial frictions we fix the entrepreneurs’ steady state default probability F̄∗ = 0.03 and their
survival rate γ∗ = 0.99. The columns “Mean” and “St. Dev.” list the means and the standard deviations for
Beta, Gamma, and Normal distributions, and the values s and ν for the Inverse Gamma (InvG) distribution,

where pIG (σ|ν, s) ∝ σ −ν−1 e−νs /2σ . The effective prior is truncated at the boundary of the determinacy

Data

Real GDP (GDPC), the GDP price deflator (GDPDEF), nominal personal consumption
expenditures (PCEC), and nominal fixed private investment (FPI) are constructed at a
quarterly frequency by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and are included in the
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Average weekly hours of production and
nonsupervisory employees for total private industries (AWHNONAG), civilian employment
(CE16OV), and civilian noninstitutional population (LNSINDEX) are produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at the monthly frequency. The first of these series is obtained
from the Establishment Survey, and the remaining from the Household Survey. Both surveys are released in the BLS Employment Situation Summary (ESS). Since our models are
estimated on quarterly data, we take averages of the monthly data. Compensation per hour
for the nonfarm business sector (COMPNFB) is obtained from the Labor Productvity and
Costs (LPC) release, and produced by the BLS at the quarterly frequency. All data are
transformed following Smets and Wouters (2007). Let ∆ denote the temporal difference
operator. Then:
= 100 ∗ ∆LN ((GDP C)/LN SIN DEX)

Output growth

Consumption growth = 100 ∗ ∆LN ((P CEC/GDP DEF )/LN SIN DEX)
Investment growth

= 100 ∗ ∆LN ((F P I/GDP DEF )/LN SIN DEX)

Real Wage growth

= 100 ∗ ∆LN (COM P N F B/GDP DEF )

Hours

= 100 ∗ LN ((AW HN ON AG ∗ CE16OV /100)/LN SIN DEX)

Inflation

= 100 ∗ ∆LN (GDP DEF ).

The federal funds rate is obtained from the Federal Reserve Board’s H.15 release at
the business day frequency. We take quarterly averages of the annualized daily data and
divide by four. In the estimation of the DSGE model with financial frictions we measure
Spread as the annualized Moody’s Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield spread over the 10Year Treasury Note Yield at Constant Maturity. Both series are available from the Federal
Reserve Board’s H.15 release. Like the federal funds rate, the spread data is also averaged
over each quarter and measured at the quarterly frequency. This leads to:
FFR

= (1/4) ∗ F EDERAL F U N DS RAT E

Spread = (1/4) ∗ (BaaCorporate − 10yearT reasury)

survey and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) available from the FRB Philadelphia’s Real-Time Data Research Center. Long-run inflation expectations (average CPI inflation over the next 10 years) are available from 1991:Q4 onwards. Prior to 1991:Q4, we use
the 10-year expectations data from the Blue Chip survey to construct a long time series that
begins in 1979:Q4. Since the Blue Chip survey reports long-run inflation expectations only
twice a year, we treat these expectations in the remaining quarters as missing observations
and adjust the measurement equation of the Kalman filter accordingly. Long-run inflation
expectations πtO,40 are therefore measured as
πtO,40 = (10-YEAR AVERAGE CPI INFLATION FORECAST − 0.50)/4.
where 0.50 is the average difference between CPI and GDP annualized inflation from the
beginning of the sample to 1992. We divide by 4 because the data are expressed in quarterly
terms.
Many macroeconomic time series get revised multiple times by the statistical agencies
that publish the series. In many cases the revisions reflect additional information that
has been collected by the agencies, in other instances revisions are caused by changes in
definitions. For instance, the BEA publishes three releases of quarterly GDP in the first
three month following the quarter. Thus, in order to be able to compare DSGE model
forecasts to real-time forecasts made by private-sector professional forecasters or the Federal
Reserve Board, it is important to construct vintages of real time historical data. We follow
the work by Edge and Gürkaynak (2010) and construct data vintages that are aligned with
the publication dates of the Blue Chip survey. A detailed description of how this data set is
constructed is provided in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013).

model. The transition equation
st = T (θ)st−1 + R(θ)t , t ∼ N (0, Q)

(A-27)

summarizes the evolution of the states st . The measurement equation:
yt = Z(θ)st + D(θ),

(A-28)

maps the states onto the vector of observables yt , where D(θ) represents the vector of steady
states for these observables. To simplify the notation we omit model superscripts/subscripts
and we drop Mm from the conditioning set. We assume that the forecasts are based on the
It−1 information set. Let θ denote the vector of DSGE model parameters. For each draw θi ,
i = 1, . . . , N , from the posterior distribution p(θ|It−1 ), execute the following steps:
1. Evaluate
T (θ), R(θ), Z(θ), D(θ).
2. Run the Kalman filter to obtain st−1|t−1 and Pt−1|t−1 .
3. Compute ŝt|t−1 = st|It−1 and P̂t|t−1 = Pt|It−1 as
(a) Unconditional forecasts: ŝt|t−1 = T st−1|t−1 , P̂t|t−1 = T Pt−1|t−1 T 0 + RQR0 .
(b) Semiconditional forecasts (using time t spreads, and FFR): after computing ŝt|t−1
and P̂t|t−1 using the “unconditional” formulas, run time t updating step of Kalman
filter using a measurement equation that only uses time t values of these two
observables.
4. Compute recursively for j = 1, .., h the objects ŝt+j|t−1 = T st+j−1|t−1 , P̂t+j|t−1 =

Dynamic Prediction Pool

In each period t, the principal has to conduct inference about λt to generate λ̂DP
t+h|t (θ), where
θ = (ρ, µ, σ)0 is the vector of hyperparameters. Some of the results that we are reporting
in the main part of the paper are conditional on a particular value of θ, while others are
obtained by integrating out θ under the relevant pseudo posterior distribution.
We use a bootstrap particle filter to update the sequence of pseudo posteriors p(h) (λt |θ, ItP , P).

By ≈ we mean that under suitable regularity conditions (see, for instance, Chopin (2004))
the Monte Carlo average satisfies a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem.
An initial set of particles can be generated by iid sampling from x0 ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ), letting
sj0 = [xj0 , Φ(xj0 )], and setting W0j = 1. The bootstrap particle filter involves the following
recursion:
1. Propagate particles forward:

Notes: Figure depicts results from Nr ep runs of the particle filter. θ is given by ρ = 0.9, µ = 0, and σ = 1.

In Figure A-1 we graphically examine the Monte Carlo variance of our estimate of
p(h) (λt |θ, ItP , P). The figure is based on N = 1, 000 particles and Nrep = 100 independent runs of the particle filter. We set ρ = 0.9, µ = 0, and σ = 1. The accuracy deteriorates
somewhat as ρ approaches one, because the innovation in state-transition equation decreases
and do does the degree of particle mutation. For the limit case ρ = 1 filtering becomes unnecessary because λt = λ.

(A-40)

In order to generate draws from pseudo-posterior p(h) (θ|ItP , P), we embedd the particlefilter approximation of the pseudo-likelihood function in an otherwise standard random-walk
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. A theoretical justification for this procedure is provided in
Andrieu et al. (2010). The random-walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) algorithm is identical
to Algorithm 1 in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013). Due to the low dimensionality of the
hyperparameter vector θ and the high degree of accuracy of the particle filter approximation,
the posterior sampler is very efficient. All results reported in the main text are based on
5,000 particles and 10,000 draws from the RWMH algorithm.
