    "abstract": "\n\nAccess to microcredit has been shown to generate only modest average benefits for recipient households. We study whether other financial market frictions\u2014in particular, lack of access to a safe place to save\u2014might limit credit's benefits. Working with Kenyan farmers, we cross-randomize access to a simple savings product with a harvest-time loan. Among farmers offered a loan, the additional offer of a savings lockbox increased farm investment by 11% and household consumption by 7%. Results suggest that financial market frictions can interact in important ways and that multifaceted financial access programs might unlock dynamic household gains.\n\n",
