Why Don't Women Patent?

NBER Working Paper No. 17888
March 2012
JEL No. J7,O31
ABSTRACT
We investigate women's underrepresentation among holders of commercialized patents: only 5.5%
of holders of such patents are female. Using the National Survey of College Graduates 2003, we find
only 7% of the gap is accounted for by women's lower probability of holding any science or engineering
degree, because women with such a degree are scarcely more likely to patent than women without.
Differences among those without a science or engineering degree account for 15%, while 78% is accounted
for by differences among those with a science or engineering degree. For the latter group, we find
that women's underrepresentation in engineering and in jobs involving development and design explain
much of the gap; closing it would increase U.S. GDP per capita by 2.7%.

Women patent much less than men. Only 10.3% of U.S. origin patents granted in
1998 are estimated to have had at least one female inventor (United States Patent and
Trademark Office 1999). Adjusting for co–authorship, Frietsch et al. (2009) estimate
that women accounted for 8.2% of patents filed by Americans at the European Patent
Office in 2005, a decrease from the 8.8% peak of 2001. The highest shares were for Spain
and France (12.3% and 10.2% respectively), while the lowest shares were for Austria and
Germany (3.2% and 4.7% respectively).1 Scholars use patents as a proxy for technological progress, an unmeasurable driver of productivity and ultimately economic growth.
While a patent represents a specific invention, patenting may be correlated with other
unpatented innovations, including those embodied in tacit knowledge and disseminated
by inter–firm worker mobility. The magnitude of the gender gap in patenting raises the
concern that, rather than reflecting comparative advantage or differing tastes by gender,
the gap reflects gender inequity and an inefficient use of female innovative capacity.
In this paper, we examine the reasons for women’s underperformance in patenting using a representative sample of U.S. college graduates, the 2003 National Survey of College
Graduates. Earlier studies investigating the question have been confined to samples of
PhDs, generally academic scientists and engineers.2 Such samples provide only limited
information about patenting generally, since our data show that PhDs hold only 29% of
patents, and academics only 7% of patents. The earlier studies focus on the gender gap
conditional on covariates, but the unconditional gender gap appears smaller than in the
general population, with men between 50% and 2.5 times more likely to patent, while the
covariates appear to explain little of the gender gap.
In our data, 7.5% of patents granted are granted to women, while only 5.5% of patents
commercialized or licensed, presumably those more important for economic growth, are
commercialized or licensed by women. We find that the patenting rate of women with
science or engineering degrees is sufficiently low that increasing women’s representation in

science and engineering would have little effect absent other changes. For commercialized
or licensed patents, only 7% of the gender gap is accounted for by the lower share of
women with any science or engineering degree, while 78% of the gap is explained by lower
female patenting among holders of a science or engineering degree. The remaining 15%
of the gender gap is explained by lower female patenting among those without a science
or engineering degree.
For holders of science and engineering (S&E) degrees, two thirds of the gender gap
reflects a gap in the probability of holding any commercialized patent. We are able to
explain 61% of this probability gap, with specific fields of study within S&E accounting
for 31% of the gap, and the degree to which respondents’ jobs involve particular tasks
accounting for at least another 13%: women are underrepresented in electrical and mechanical engineering, the most patent–intensive fields, and in development and design, the
most patent–intensive job tasks. Women’s education, in particular their lower share of
doctorates, accounts for another 10%. The gender gap in the number of commercialized
patents conditional on holding any has slightly different determinants. We are able to
explain almost half this gap, with job tasks explaining 40% of the gap, women’s younger
age 29%, and certain other characteristics working to increase the gap. The influential
job tasks are design and development.
The results make clear that the first steps towards increasing female patenting rates
must be to increase women’s representation in electrical and mechanical engineering,
relative to life sciences, and in jobs involving design and development. Current trends
are changing the patenting gap only slowly. For example, the share of women in the
sample with a bachelor’s degree in engineering is increasing only 0.9 percentage points
per decade in our sample, and the trend is slowing. The gender patenting gap is of
economic significance: eliminating the patenting shortfall of female holders of science and
engineering degrees would increase GDP per capita by 2.7%.

Data

We use individual–level data from the 2003 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG),
data collected under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. The data may be
downloaded at sestat.nsf.gov/datadownload. These data are a stratified random sample
of people reporting having a bachelor’s degree or higher on the long form of the 2000
census. All respondents who had ever worked were asked whether they had applied for
a U.S. patent since October 1998, whether they had been granted any U.S. patent since
October 1998, and if so, how many, and how many had been commercialized or licensed.
The survey will not capture patents by those with less than a college degree, but we
assume that most patents are captured. The data contain a rich set of variables describing
respondents’ education and job, including job tasks. We count as holders of S&E degrees
respondents with bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degrees in science (excluding social
sciences) or in engineering, as well as those who minored in science or engineering in
college.3 We exclude from our sample respondents 65 or older (the youngest respondent is
24, but few are younger than 26) and respondents who live outside the United States or in
U.S. territories. The sample of potential patentors we work with has 88,094 observations,
representing 2070 patents granted and 1299 patents commercialized or licensed.

Method

We first decompose the gender patenting gap so as to highlight the importance of women’s
lower representation among those with any degree in science or engineering. If P (SE) is
the probability of having a degree in science or engineering, we may write
E(N ) = P (SE)E(N |SE) + [1 − P (SE)]E(N |non SE),
or
N = P S N̂ S + (1 − P S )N̂ O ,
3
Three quarters of those who minored in S&E also majored in S&E, so including those with minors
expands the sample only slightly.

3

where the hat denotes the average conditioning on science and engineering degree status,
and O indexes non–S&E. The gender gap is therefore
S
O
N m − N f = [PmS N̂m
+ (1 − PmS )N̂m
] − [PfS N̂fS + (1 − PfS )N̂fO ],

where m and f subscripts denote gender. This may be rewritten as
S
O
N m − N f = (PmS − PfS )(N̂fS − N̂fO ) + PmS (N̂m
− N̂fS ) + (1 − PmS )(N̂m
− N̂fO ).

(1)

The first term on the right hand side represents the share of the gap due to the gender
gap in having a science or engineering degree; the second represents the share due to
the gender patenting gap among those with a science or engineering degree; the third
the share due to the gender patenting gap among those without a science or engineering
degree.4
The same equation may be used to decompose the gender gap in the probability of
patenting, P , by replacing N̂ with P̂ , the probability of patenting conditional on science
and engineering degree status, on the right hand side. The gender gap in the number
e , may be decomposed by replacing N̂
of patents conditional on having any patent, N
e
with N̂ , the average number of patents conditional on having a patent and on science
and engineering degree status, and P S with PeS , the probability of having a science or
engineering degree conditional on having a patent.
In the same spirit, we investigate the degree to which the gender patenting gap is
caused by the gender difference in the probability of having any patent, and the gender
difference in the number of patents conditional on having any. If N is the number of
e , where the tilde
patents, E(N ) = P (Any patent) × E(N |Any patent), or N = P N
denotes the average conditioning on having a patent. The gender gap is therefore
em − Pf N
ef .
N m − N f = Pm N
4

The decomposition is sensitive to the choice of this variant rather than its dual. We consider this
one more appropriate in a context where the counterfactual of increasing the share of women in S&E is
of interest: the additional women would presumably experience a patenting boost equal to the current
female S&E/non–S&E differential, so the weight on the S&E representation gap (the first component in
equation 2) should be the female S&E/non–S&E patenting differential, not the male as in the dual.

4

This may be rewritten as
em − N
ef ) + N
ef (Pm − Pf ),
N m − N f = Pm (N

(2)

with the first term on the right hand side reflecting the share of the gap due to the gender
gap in the number of patents conditional on having any patent, and the second term
reflecting the gap in the probability of having any patent.
Having performed these decompositions, we run regressions on separate samples of
science and engineering degree holders and other degree holders, and we separately examine the probability of patenting and the number of patents conditional on having any, as
the determinants may differ. We focus on patents commercialized, given their probable
greater contribution to economic growth, but results for patents granted are similar. For
the full samples of all those who have ever worked, we report linear probability coefficients
(probit marginal effects are similar) from regressions of the form:
P (Any commercialized patent)i = α0 + α1 Fi + α2 Xi + i ,

(3)

where the coefficient of interest is α1 , the coefficient on the female dummy. For the
samples of commercialized patent holders (whom we sometimes refer to as inventors) we
report coefficients from least squares estimation of
log(Commercialized patents|any)i = β0 + β1 Fi + β2 Xi + νi ,

(4)

where β1 is the coefficient of interest. Finally, for the samples of patent holders (commercialized or not), we report linear probability coefficients from regressions for the probability of commercializing a patent conditional on any patent being granted:
P (P atent commercialized|patent granted)i = γ0 + γ1 Fi + γ2 Xi + ηi .

(5)

All regressions are weighted with the survey weights, and robust standard errors are
calculated in all cases. In all regressions, we gradually add covariates to assess how much
of the gender gap is due to gender differences in particular characteristics. The controls
include demographics, detailed fields of study, highest degree, employment and student
5

status, whether a bachelor’s degree level knowledge of science or engineering was necessary
for the job, the degree to which the work on the job is related to the field of highest degree,
and controls for whether at least 10% of time on the job is spent in activities we judged
likely to be associated with patenting: basic research, applied research, development,
design, computer tasks and management. Job–related covariates are interacted with a
dummy for employed.

Descriptive statistics

Table 1, based on samples where an observation is a patent, shows that 7.5% of patents
granted were reported by female inventors (column 1), while only 5.5% of commercialized
or licensed patents, were reported by female inventors (column 4). The lower figure
for commercialized patents is due to the fact that while overall 77% of patents granted
were commercialized (column 1), only 62% of patents granted to female inventors were
commercialized (column 3), compared to 79% for men (column 2). 74% of patent holders
hold S&E degrees (column 1), a share that is slightly higher for women than men and
lower among holders of commercialized patents, especially men (68%, column 4).
Table 2 shows statistics based on the full sample of respondents (those who have ever
worked), split by gender and S&E degree status. S&E degree holders patent more than
others, and within both degree categories men patent more than women. For example,
4.4% of men with S&E degrees report being granted a patent, and 2.9% report commercializing a patent (column 2), compared to 1.0% and 0.6% respectively for women (column 3).
The male–female disparity is larger for the (unconditional) number of patents, indicating
that male inventors have more patents than female inventors.
In Table 3, we take a first step towards investigating the reasons for higher patenting
rates for men among S&E degree holders (panel A), and among non–S&E degree holders
(panel B), by showing the distribution of fields of study by gender and the patenting
intensity of each field. Columns 1 and 2 show the highest degrees of women with any S&E
degree are concentrated in the life sciences: 27% of their highest degrees are in this field,
6

compared to 14% for men. Consequently, women with S&E degrees are underrepresented
in most other S&E fields, with the largest gaps in the relatively large (for men) fields of
electrical and mechanical engineering.
The consequences of these different fields of study may be seen in columns 3–6: respondents reporting a highest degree in life sciences report only 0.06 patents on average
(column 4), compared with 0.28 in electrical engineering, the most patent–intensive field,
and 0.18 in mechanical engineering. Women with S&E degrees are also slightly underrepresented in the other patent–intensive fields of physical sciences and chemical engineering.
The disparity between more female and more male fields is higher for commercialized
patents (columns 5 and 6), since, as column 7 shows, only 39% of patents granted in life
sciences are commercialized, compared to 62% in electrical engineering and mechanical
engineering.
The lower panel examines the sample of respondents with no degree in S&E. We follow
the NSF’s classification of “technology” fields (which include computer programming, as
distinct from computer science) as “S&E–related” rather than as S&E. For this sample,
the most common S&E–related fields other than technology are science education fields.
Women without an S&E degree are underrepresented in technology (compare columns 1
and 2), which not surprisingly is the most patent–intensive of these fields. However, with
only 0.04 patents granted per person (column 4), technology is not very patent intensive
compared to S&E fields, and it represents only a small fraction of non–S&E degrees.
Most technology patents are commercialized (67% in column 7), yet technology’s average
number of commercialized patents is only half the S&E average of 0.06 (column 6).
In Tables 4 and 5, we similarly examine a set of job characteristics, for those working
at the survey date. In Table 4, we consider the sample of respondents with an S&E degree.
The first panel shows that men and women are equally likely to have a job closely related
to the field of study of highest degree (columns 1 and 2), and that not surprisingly, those
working in jobs closely related to science and engineering study have more patents than
others (columns 3 and 4). Women are slightly more likely to be working in an unrelated
field, which should tend to reduce their patenting. The second panel shows that men are
7

much more likely to work in a job for which a knowledge of science and engineering at at
least a bachelor’s level is required: 72% of men do so, compared to 59% of women, and
there is a sharp divide in patenting between respondents who have jobs requiring such
knowledge (0.079 commercialized patents per person) and those who do not (0.009).
The third panel shows similar statistics according to whether respondents reported
spending at least 10% of their time on various tasks likely to be related to patenting.
Women are slightly underrepresented in basic and applied research, somewhat underrepresented in computer tasks, and very underrepresented in development and design, as well
as management. At the same time, there are large patenting disparities between those
that do and do not do applied research, development and design (columns 3 and 4).
Table 5 shows statistics for the sample of respondents without an S&E degree. The job
characteristics which are most closely associated with patenting and in which women are
most underrepresented are design and development, with a similar but much less marked
pattern in management. Appendix Tables 1 and 2 show means of other variables used in
estimation.

Results

We decompose the gender patenting gap before running regressions, focusing on commercialized patents, to establish the determinants of the gender gap among those with S&E
degrees, and among those without. Finally, we estimate the probability of commercializing
a patent for those who have been granted a patent.

4.1

Decomposition results

Table 6 presents results based on the decomposition of equation (1). The means underlying
the decomposition are presented in Appendix Table 3. The first column shows that for
commercialized patents, 5.6% of the gender gap is owing to the smaller fraction of women
with an S&E degree, 62% is owing to a gender gap among holders of an S&E degree, and
32% is owing to a gender gap among holders of other degrees.
8

This decomposition is heavily influenced by one observation, however: a male with a
degree in communications reporting having 70 commercialized patents, an outlier among
those without an S&E degree (the next highest tally is 15), and second most prolific
patenter in the sample. There does not seem to be an error: the respondent reports that
his work is unrelated to the field of his highest degree, that his main task is development,
and that his occupation is manager. Nevertheless, we feel more comfortable with the
decomposition dropping this observation, and this is reported in column 2. Now the
share of the gap within S&E degree holders dominates more clearly at 78%, compared to
7% due to the smaller fraction of women with an S&E degree, and 15% for the within
non–S&E component. Columns 3 and 4 shows the decompositions of the probability of
any patents and the number of patents per inventor are similar.
Simulations provide a different way of representing the components of the gender gap.
If the share of women in S&E were increased to that of men, patents per woman would
rise by a factor of 1.9. This would increase women’s share of commercialized patents to
10.0%, rather than 5.5% as currently, increasing the number of commercialized patents
by 5.0%.5 On the other hand, if female patenting in S&E were instead raised so as to
eliminate the within–S&E patenting gap, patents per woman would rise by a factor of 5.3,
resulting in women contributing 23.5% of commercialized patents. This would increase
the number of commercialized patents by 23.6%.
We can make a crude calculation of the benefit of the additional patents using the
results of Furman, Porter and Stern (2002), who find that the elasticity of a country’s
GDP with respect to its patent stock is 0.113, controlling for capital and labor. Closing the
S&E representation gap would therefore increase GDP per capita by 0.113 × 5.0 = 0.6%,
and closing the S&E patenting gap would increase GDP per capita by 0.113×23.7 = 2.7%.6
It is useful in interpreting the regressions that follow to use equation (2) to assess
how much of the gender patenting gap in commercialized patents is due to a gap in
5

The outlier’s patents are included in this calculation.
The elasticity applies to all patents, rather than to commercialized patents, but the simulations
based on patents granted yield similar increases in GDP per capita: a 0.8% increase from increasing
women’s representation in S&E, and a 2.7% increase from closing the S&E patenting gap.

the probability of having any commercialized patent versus the gap in the number of
commercialized patents conditional on having any. For holders of S&E degrees, 66% is
attributable to the gap in the probability of patenting, and the figure of 63% for holders
of non–S&E degrees (without the outlier) is very similar.

4.2

Probability of patenting

We now estimate the regressions of equation (3) to explain the gender gap in the probability of patenting, the more important component of the patenting gap. In Table 7 panel A,
for S&E degree holders, we examine the probability of commercializing a patent, beginning with only the female dummy in column 1: S&E women are 2.3 percentage points
less likely to patent than S&E men. Adding dummies for race, ethnicity and nativity in
column 2 changes little, but adding 142 dummies for field of study of highest degree and
29 dummies for field of study of bachelor’s degree in column 3 reduces the coefficient to
1.5 percentage points, a decrease corresponding to 31% of the original effect in column 1.
The covariates added in columns 4–8 cumulatively explain more of the gap, with
education controls explaining 10% of the gap (column 4), but the dummies for how closely
related one’s work is to one’s highest degree, and whether one needs knowledge of a science
or engineering bachelor’s degree for the job (column 8) having little effect. The effect of
the education controls reflects the lower share of women with doctoral degrees. Only
when the dummies for whether at least 10% of the respondent’s time is spent in specific
tasks does the coefficient fall again appreciably: from 1.2 percentage points in column 8
to 0.9 percentage points in column 9, or 13% of the original gap. This is likely to be an
underestimate of the contribution of job tasks, since tasks are measured at the survey
date, while patents are measured over a five year window. Unreported regressions reveal
that while each task control individually reduces the gender gap, those with the strongest
effects are design and development. Altogether, the covariates explain 61% of the raw
gender gap.
In panel B, we repeat the exercise for the sample of non–S&E degree holders. Women

10

are 0.32 percentage points less likely to commercialize a patent than men. Only the
controls for job tasks in column 8 make much of a difference to the coefficient, reducing
it from 0.25 to 0.21 percentage points, or 16% of the raw gender gap. Altogether, the
covariates explain only 34% of the raw gap.

4.3

Patents per inventor

We next turn to examining the number of commercialized patents, conditional on any
having been commercialized, and present results of estimating equation (4) for the S&E
sample in Table 8 panel A. Female inventors commercialize 17 log points fewer patents
than men (column 1), and controlling for detailed field of study in column 3 increases
the gap to 24 log points. Although this suggests women’s choice of field is beneficial to
patenting, the effect is outweighed by the opposite effect of field on the more important
gap in the probability of patenting at all (Table 7 panel A).
Controls for age and years since highest degree are important for the gap in patents
per inventor, reducing the conditional gender gap from 24 log points in column 5 to 18 log
points in column 6, or by 29% of the raw gender gap. Job tasks are again important in
column 9, accounting for 40% of the raw gender gap. Unreported regressions indicate that
design tasks influence the gender gap the most, followed by development and management.
Basic research and computer tasks do not affect the gap. The covariates together explain
49% of the raw gender gap.
In panel B, we examine the gender gap in the number of patents per inventor among
those without an S&E degree. We are unable to explain this gender gap, with most
covariates only deepening the puzzle. The raw gap is a large 37 log points, statistically
significant at the 10% level, while the conditional gap in column 8 is 61 log points, though
statistically insignificant. Only job tasks (column 8) make a non–trivial contribution to
understanding the raw gap, explaining 27% of it.
The panel B regressions are sensitive to the outlier mentioned above, so in panel C, we
present the coefficients from regressions on a sample with the outlier dropped. The raw

11

gap is smaller, at 21 log points (column 1), statistically significant at the 10% level. Fields
of study deepen the puzzle, while doing work requiring science or engineering knowledge
(column 7) and job tasks (column 8) appear to explain a lot of the gap, though the
estimates are very imprecise.

4.4

Probability of commercializing a granted patent

We have focused on commercialized patents, as these are likely to be those contributing more to economic growth. Table 1 indicated that conditional on being granted any
patent, female inventors are less likely to commercialize a patent than male inventors.
We examine this conditional probability explicitly in Table 9, by estimating equation
(5). For S&E degree holders, in panel A, there is a 9.7 percentage point raw gender gap
(column 1), statistically significant at the 10% level, which may be compared with the
overall commercialization rate of 77%. 70% of this gap is explained by detailed field of
study (column 3); age and years since highest degree explain another 24% (column 6),
while other covariates either explain little or increase the puzzle. Together the covariates
explain 86% of the gap.
Due to the small sample size of only 202 patents, we are less successful in understanding
this outcome for those without an S&E degree (panel B). The raw gender gap is 8.8
percentage points, but it is statistically insignificant. The point estimates indicate that
most covariates deepen the puzzle, while job tasks make a large contribution to explaining
the raw gap, with an additional contribution of age and years since highest degree. The
column 9 point estimate is the same as in column 1.

Conclusions

Women are much less likely to be granted a patent than men, and are somewhat less
likely to commercialize or license the patents they are granted. Because women with a
degree in S&E patent little more than other women, increasing the share of women in
S&E would not greatly increase patenting. Only 7% of the gender gap in commercialized
12

patents is owing to women’s underrepresentation in S&E, compared to 78% owing to the
patenting gap among holders of S&E degrees. Results for all patents granted are similar.
The gender patenting gap is economically very significant: closing the gap among S&E
degree holders would increase commercialized patents by 24% and GDP per capita by
2.7%.
The most important determinants of the gender gap among S&E degree holders are
women’s underrepresentation in patent–intensive fields of study, especially electrical and
mechanical engineering, and in patent–intensive job tasks, especially development and
design. Women’s lower share of doctoral degrees plays a minor role, reducing their probability of patenting at all, while women’s younger age plays a minor role by reducing the
number of patents for those who have any. Hunt (2010) finds that pay and promotion
issues cause women to be more likely than men to leave engineering (compared to other
fields). As similar patterns are found in other male–dominated fields, she recommends
improving women engineers’ mentoring and networks, and addressing possible discrimination by managers and co–workers. Such measures might also encourage more women
to enter engineering.
It is also useful to note factors found to be unimportant among S&E degree holders.
Conditional on age and years since highest degree, current employment status and years
since last employment do not affect the gender gap. Though women in the sample are
closely attached to the labor force, the effect of actual experience may be larger than captured by these measures anchored on the survey date. Other variables with little effect on
the conditional gender gap include the extent to which the respondent’s job is related to
the field of study of highest degree and whether the respondent’s job requires science or
engineering knowledge at the level of a bachelor’s degree or higher. This is despite a large
gender gap in the S&E knowledge requirement variable, and a large unconditional patenting differential between respondents in jobs requiring and not requiring S&E knowledge:
these gaps reflect different choices of field of study.
The results highlight the importance of distinguishing between science and engineering
in research on the choice of field of study. Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2011) study
13

the decision to major in science and math in a liberal arts college where engineering
is not an option; Zafar (2008) uses data from a university at which engineering school
students must declare their engineering major on entering college, and therefore drops
these students. The necessity for potential engineering majors of being well–informed in
high school might not be unrelated to the low share of women in engineering. Further
research is also required on movements into and out of design and development jobs.

Note: Coefficients from least squares regressions weighted with survey weights; robust standard errors. The panel A sample has 35,175 observations,
the panel B sample 52,919. Race and ethnicity controls are dummies for Asian, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic any race and mixed race non-Hispanic.
Immigrant controls are dummies for born abroad non-citizen, born abroad as U.S. citizen, born in U.S. territories. Fields of study controls are 142 (83
in panel B) dummies for field of study of highest degree, and 29 (14 in panel B) dummies for field of study of bachelor’s degree. Highest degree
controls are dummies for master’s, doctoral and professional degrees. Level of S&E degree comprises four dummies for bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral
and minor degrees in science or engineering. Potential experience is controlled with six age dummies and five dummies for years since highest degree.
Labor force status comprises a dummy for employed, the number of years since last employment interacted with employment, and dummies for
fulltime master’s student, fulltime doctoral student, and other student. Need S&E knowledge is a dummy for whether the respondent reported that
bachelor’s degree level knowledge of science or engineering was necessary for the job. Study/job relatedness controls are two dummies for the current
job is closely or fairly closely related to the field of study of highest degree. Jobs tasks are dummies for whether the respondent spends more than 10%
of work time on basic research, applied research, development, design, computer tasks or management. Job covariates are interacted with an
employment dummy. S&E denotes science and engineering.
