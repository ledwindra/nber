Capital Flow Management with Multiple Instruments
Viral V. Acharya and Arvind Krishnamurthy
NBER Working Paper No. 24443
March 2018
JEL No. E44,F3,G01,G18
ABSTRACT
We examine theoretically the role of reserves management and macro-prudential capital controls
as ex-post and ex-ante safeguards, respectively, against sudden stops, and argue that these
measures are complements rather than substitutes. Absent capital controls, reserves to be
deployed ex post are partially undone ex ante by short-term capital flows, a form of moral hazard
from the insurance provided by reserves in sudden stops. Ex ante capital controls offset this
distortion and thereby increase the benefit of holding reserves. Thus, these instruments are
complements. With foreign investment flows into both domestic and external borrowing markets,
capital controls need to account for the possibility of regulatory arbitrage between the markets.
Through the lens of the model, we analyze movements in foreign reserves, external debt, and the
range of capital controls being employed by one large emerging market, viz. India.

Introduction

Emerging markets (EMs) are affected by a global financial cycle originating in developed economies
(Rey (2013)). An increase in risk appetite of developed economies, perhaps spurred by easy monetary policy, leads to a surge in capital flows to EMs. These foreign capital flows, especially foreign
portfolio investments (FPI) in debt and equity markets (as against foreign direct equity investments or FDI), can reverse quickly, leading to a sudden stop and sharp macroeconomic slowdown. Managing this capital flow cycle is a central concern for EM governments (as discussed by
De Gregorio (2010) and Ostry et al. (2010)) and is the focus of this paper.
These points are evident in events of the last 10 years. Figure 1 plots as an example Foreign
Domestic Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) flows into India over the period
2004 to 2017. FPI flows (in blue) drop sharply in the global financial crisis, before rising in the
post-crisis period when developed economy interest rates are low. They reverse again in the taper
tantrum of 2013, when investors feared that the Federal Reserve may tighten monetary policy
(see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2013)). When these fears ease in 2014, capital flows
resume, before falling again in late 2015 as the Fed indeed raises rates. The figure also plots FDI
flows, which are far more stable.

The capital flow reversal in the taper tantrum episode led to a sharp depreciation of the Indian
Rupee. Figure 2 plots the exchange rate (red line) from 2004 to 2017, with the shaded region
indicating the taper tantrum period. The Rupee depreciated by over 30% against the US Dollar in
the summer of 2013, more so than other EMs on average (blue line in graph).

In response to such capital flow volatility and attendant consequences on exchange rates, EMs
have adoped two main strategies: hoard foreign reserves and impose capital controls. Reserves
can act as a buffer against a sudden stop. See Obstfeld et al. (2010)’s discussion of the intellectual
history and underpinnings of the role of foreign reserves as a buffer against sudden stops. Capital
controls that reduce external debt limit the vulnerability of an EM to sudden stops. The IMF study
by Ostry et al. (2010) provides a comprehensive examination of the motivation behind capital
controls as well as the effectiveness of such controls in practice.
This paper revisits the topic of capital flow management, and particularly the interaction between two commonly deployed instruments to achieve it, viz., foreign reserves policies and capital
controls. In practice as well as in much of the literature on capital flow management, capital controls and reserves management are cast as alternative instruments which can both reduce sudden
stop vulnerability. Our principal theoretical result is that these policies interact and should be
seen by central banks as complementary instruments. Better capital controls enable more effective
reserve management. Likewise, a higher level of foreign reserves dictates stronger capital controls.

3

Jeanne (2016) is another study that examines the complementarity between these instruments in a
somewhat different setting than ours.
The intuition for our key result is simply stated. One way of interpreting the sudden stop is as
a state of the world in which foreign creditors refuse to rollover both external (foreign currency)
short-term debt and domestic (local currency) short-term debt. This can trigger both a currency
crisis and a rollover/banking crisis. Borrowers with external debt will fire-sale domestic assets
to convert to foreign currency to repay foreign creditors. Foreign holders of domestic debt will
convert repayments from this debt into foreign currency. The liquidation of domestic assets for
foreign currency triggers a currency crisis. The rollover problem triggers defaults and a banking
crisis. Thus our model embeds the twin-crisis nature of sudden stops in EMs (Kaminsky and
Reinhart (1999)). The crisis is worsened if the aggregate quantity of external and domestic shortterm debt is higher as this results in more fire-sales. On the other side, in the extremis, central
bank reserves can be used to reduce currency depreciation as well as borrower defaults. Thus,
reserves reduce the magnitude of the fire-sale discount in prices. But ex ante, they induce greater
undertaking of short-term liabilities by borrowers, a form of moral hazard from the insurance
effect of reserves in case of sudden stops: the greater the reserves, the lower is the anticipated firesale discount in prices, and in turn, greater the undertaking of short-term liabilities. Hence, unless
the build-up of reserves is coincident with capital controls on the growth of short-term liabilities,
the insurance effect of reserves is undone by the private choice of short-term liabilities. In other
words, reserves and capital controls are complementary measures in the regulatory toolkit.
With capital flows into both foreign currency and domestic currency denominated assets, there
arises a further complementarity result. If capital controls can only be introduced on one margin,
say foreign currency debt, then they cannot be too tight. Otherwise, there is the prospect of arbitrage of capital controls between the two markets: borrowing short-term will switch to domestic
currency assets, even if domestic borrowing is costlier in a spread sense as it enjoys weaker capital
controls. We show that with an additional instrument, say capital controls on domestic currency
debt, capital controls as a whole can be more effective, which then makes reserve polices also more
effective. We show that the design of capital controls in such a setting where the emerging market
currency is internationalized to an extent requires careful weighing of the gains from attracting
capital flows, typically in the form of lower cost of borrowing abroad relative to domestically,
against the cost of sudden stops and the cross-market regulatory arbitrage of capital controls. The
main thrust of our analysis prevails though that central banks should not design reserves management and capital control policies as substitutes; they are in fact complements enhancing each
others effectiveness.
Our paper contributes to the large literature on the role of reserves and capital controls in
managing sudden stops. Ostry et al. (2010) provides a comprehensive examination of the moti-

4

vation behind capital controls as well as the effectiveness of such controls in practice. Obstfeld
et al. (2010) discusses the intellectual history and underpinnings of the role of foreign reserves as
a buffer against sudden stops. Aizenman and Marion (2003) rationalize the build-up of reserves
in Asia as a response to precautionary motives. Jeanne and Ranciere (2011) provides a quantitative analysis regarding how much reserves a central bank should hold, shedding light on the
well-known Greenspan-Guidotti rule (Greenspan (April 29 1999)). In this literature, typically both
reserves and capital controls are viewed as precautionary tools to buffer against sudden stops (see,
for example, Aizenman (2011)). Thus the literature typically takes the perspective that these tools
are substitutes, whereas our main result is that they are complements. Our paper is also related
to the classic analysis of Poole (1970) studying the optimal choice of instruments. The principal
difference between our analysis and Poole’s is that in his model the instruments are substitutes
while in our case they are complements. We discuss this further in the conclusion.
Section 2 presents empirical evidence suggestive of the complementarity perspective. Section
3 builds a model to analyze reserves and capital controls jointly. Finally, as a case study for the
analysis, we discuss in Section 4 how capital controls have been used in India and how they map
into the model’s economic forces and implications.

over the period 1999 to 2015.1 . There is a dramatic increase in foreign reserves after the global
financial crisis. From 2006 to 2015, reserves increase from $0.78 trillion to just over $1.7 trillion.
Indeed, many policy-makers and academics have described the reserve accumulation as a proactive capital flow management strategy. Carstens (2016) documents the dramatic increase in the
volatility of capital flows after 2006 (see Chart 3 of his paper). He notes that the accumulation
of international reserves is the primary policy tool EMs have used to manage this capital flow
volatility.
The right panel of Figure 3 graphs the aggregate external short-term debt of these EMs. As is
well understood in the literature, reserves can act as a buffer against withdrawals of these flows
in the event of a sudden stop. External creditors may choose not to rollover their short-term
debt, indicating a liquidity need for the country that is partially covered with foreign reserves.
The so-called Greenspan-Guidotti rule (Greenspan (April 29 1999)) is a prescription that EMs hold
reserves equal to external debt less than one-year in maturity. It is apparent that as foreign reserves
have grown, short-term debt has also grown.
Figure 4 below graphs India’s forex reserves, showing that they rose steadily after the global
financial crisis until 2011, dipping slightly by 2012 and then remaining relatively flat until the taper
tantrum. In an absolute sense, India’s reserves had accumulated by the 2013 taper tantrum to
exceed the level in the crisis of 2008 levels, suggesting greater external sector resilience. However,
the net capital outflow after the Federal Reserve’s taper announcement led to a sharp depreciation
in the exchange rate as evident from Figure 2. The culprit is short-term debt: the diagnosis of
resilience is reversed if one accounts for the build-up of external debt in India.
Figure 5, Panel A plots the time-series of India’s external debt, which rose steadily and was
at close to 25% relative to GDP around the taper tantrum. Equally importantly, the short-term
component of this debt (with residual maturity less than one year) is seen in Figure 5 Panel B to
have also risen steadily (to around 20% short-term debt) by the 2013 taper tantrum.
Let us define liquidity (or external-sector resilience) metric at the country level:
Liquidityi,t =

Reservesi,t − ST Debti,t
.
GDPi,t

(1)

Figure 6 shows that the liquidity measure had been steadily declining for India from a peak of
above 20% prior to the global financial crisis to a low of below 10% by the taper tantrum, thus
more accurately capturing the loss of resilience as witnessed during the period from May-August
of 2013.
To summarize, the case of India in the build up to the taper tantrum suggests that forex re1 The countries are Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru,

Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela. Note that we exclude China in this calculation, primarily
because the movement in China’s reserve holdings are so large relative to the rest of the EMs. China’s foreign reserves
rise by about $2.4 trillion from 2006 to 2015.

serves, per se, were not adequate in measuring external sector resilience against sudden stops. The
model we develop in this paper studies the linkage between reserves and short-term debt. We
will argue theoretically that reserve adequacy is contingent upon the quantity and quality of debt,
and in particular, the extent of short-term external debt. Our theoretical analysis also points to
the mechanism whereby the increase in reserves in part likely drove the rise in short-term external debt, although it is difficult to causally identify this economic force from the data we have
presented.
We next investigate the linkage between reserves and short-term debt more broadly across
EMs, asking how well the liquidity metric in (1) discriminates among countries in their exposure
to the global financial cycle.
Figure 7 plots country liquidity as of 2013, as in (1 with t =2013), against asset price changes,
for a group of emerging markets. We consider asset price changes from June 2013 to October 2017.
We begin in June 2013 to include the start of the taper tantrum. Over this period, the global financial cycle turns back towards developed economies, so that on average EM currencies depreciate
(see Panel C). The figure reveals that the liquidity metric discriminates between the EMs that are
more and less sensitive to the financial cycle. From Panel C we see that countries that are more
liquid see their currencies depreciate less. Likewise, more liquid countries see sovereign bond
yield spreads rise less (Panel A) and experience higher domestic stock market returns (Panel B).
That is, in all cases, higher liquidity is associated with a more favorable EM asset price outcome.

We next turn to in high frequency data. The relation in Figure 7 reflects a correlation over a
long time window, where the global shock is negative for EMs. At a high frequency, we can hope
to uncover more shifts in the global cycle and hence better document a relation between liquidity
and EM performance. Our approach builds on the literature and particularly Rey (2013), who
notes the importance of VIX for the global cycle. We proxy for the global factor using the VIX
multiplied by -1 (i.e., the negative of the VIX). Our normalization is that when the global factor
is high we say that capital flows are favorable to EMs. Using the AR(1) innovations to the global
factor, we estimate the heterogenous effect of the global financial cycle on countries with different
degrees of liquidity.
Table 1 reports the results of panel data regressions. In Panel A, the dependent variable is the
daily change in the sovereign bond spread of a given country. The independent variables are the
global factor innovations in columns (1) and (2), and the global factor innovations interacted with
liquidity, as well as liquidity by itself, in columns (3) and (4). We include country and year fixed
effects in all regressions. Columns (2) and (4) restrict the data to observations with large global
shocks, defined as those in the 5% tails of the distribution of daily global innovations to check for
non-linearities. The independent variables have been normalized by dividing by their standard
deviation, so that the coefficients can be interpreted as the effect of a one-sigma change.
We see that the global factor innovation comes in with a negative coefficient in all four columns.
There is no discernible difference between the cases where we restrict the observations to large
shocks, indicating no evidence of non-linearities. The negative coefficients are to be expected as
the global factor is defined in terms of good news for EMs (hence, for instance, sovereign bond
spreads fall). The more relevant covariate for our analysis is the second row which is the global

factor innovation interacted with liquidity. Higher liquidity dampens the impact of innovations
in the global factor on changes in sovereign bond spreads. The regression results are consistent
with the pattern evident in Figure 7.
Panel B reports results for the domestic stock market return. Stock returns load positively
on the global factor. The interaction term has a negative sign, indicating dampening, but the
coefficient is not statistically different from zero.
Panel C is for the EM currency appreciation. As expected, the coefficient on the global factor
innovation is positive. Again we see evidence of the dampening effect as the coefficient on the
interaction is negative and significant.2
These results from our data analysis indicate that asset price changes in EMs depend on the
global shocks, consistent with a number of papers in the literature (see Calvo et al. (1996) and Rey
(2013)). We also see that the impact of the global factor depends on the liquidity of the EM, which
in turn depends on the foreign reserves of the central bank and the external short-term debt of
the EM, as we may expect from the literature on international reserves as a buffer against sudden
stops. The next section builds on these observations to construct a model to study the management
of capital flows when there are multiple policy instruments, viz., reserves management and capital
controls.
2 We

have experimented with specifications where we include reserves and short-term debt separately in these regressions for Panels A-C. We would expect that the coefficients on these measures will have opposite signs, when
interacted with the global factor. However, there is not enough variation in the data to detect this pattern.

Model of Macro-prudential Management of Capital Flows

This section lays out a model of emerging market firms, more generally, banks or governments,
that borrow from foreign investors to fund high return investments. The model is closest to Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001) and Caballero and Simsek (2016). Foreign investors are “fickle”
in the sense of Caballero and Simsek (2016): they may receive a shock that requires them to withdraw funding from the emerging market. The loss of funding leads to a fire-sale, depreciating the
exchange rate, and creating an external effect for all borrowers as in Caballero and Krishnamurthy
(2001). The central bank has foreign reserves that it can use to reduce the fire-sale and stabilize
the exchange rate. We study the connections between the central bank’s actions and private sector
borrowing decisions. We first lay out a model where all borrowing is via an external debt market,
i.e., dollar debt. We then introduce foreign lending in domestic currency debt.

Model with external debt market

The model has three classes of agents: domestic borrowers (B), foreign lenders (FL), and a central
bank (CB). There are three dates: t = 0, 1, 2. Date 0 is a borrowing and investment date, at date 1
there are shocks, and at date 2 there are final payoffs.
There is a continuum of borrowers with unit mass. Each B has a project that requires capital
and own labor. B’s utility is:
U B = E [ c 2 − l0 − l1 ]

c2 , l0 , l1 ≥ 0,

(2)

where c2 is date 2 investment and l0 and l1 are disutility from labor at date 0 and date 1.
The borrower has an investment project at date 0. B can create K units of capital by borrowing,
LF = K

(3)

goods from foreign lenders, and providing labor of l0 (K ), with l0 (·) increasing and convex. The
project pays (1 + 2R)K at date 2 and cannot be liquidated early.
FL are the only lenders at date 0. They have a large endowment of goods and are risk neutral.
FL’s required return in lending to the emerging market is 1 + r. A period in which developed
market interest rates are low corresponds to a period when r is low. Additionally, if risk appetite
for EM bonds is high, we can think of r as being low.
Our key assumption is that lenders are fickle. With probability φ they may receive a retrenchment shock at date 1 in which case they need to withdraw their funding. We assume that it is
not possible to write contracts contingent on this shock. Thus, the foreign lenders lend via oneperiod loans that may or may not be rolled over. It is clearest to think of these loans as in units of
”dollars.”
12

If a loan is not rolled over, borrowers owe foreign lenders L F (1 + r ) dollars. Loans must be
repaid; bankruptcy costs are infinite. To repay a loan, the borrower turns to domestic lenders to
borrow funds against collateral of K units of the project. We assume these lenders are present
at date 1 and are willing to lend against collateral of K at interest rate of r. The borrower raises

(1 + r )K domestic currency (”rupees”), with promised repayment of (1 + 2r )K, converts this to
e(1 + r )K dollars, so that the borrower raises a total of e(1 + r )K. Here e is the exchange rate in
units of dollars per rupee. A depreciated rupee corresponds to a low value of e. The shortfall to
the borrower, i.e., owed dollar debt minus funds raised from the domestic loan, is K (1 + r )(1 − e).
The borrower makes up this shortfall by working hard and suffering disutility,
l1 = β (K (1 + r )(1 − e)) ,

(4)

with β(·) increasing and convex. By doing so, and with funds from the domestic loan, the borrower repays (1 + r )K in full. β(·) is modeled as disutility of labor to keep the model concise
rather than to reflect realism. We think of β(·) as as the deadweight cost of bankruptcy. More
generally, it can reflect costly adjustments that must be made in order to meet debt payments.
The central bank has total foreign exchange reserves of X F which it can use to stabilize the
exchange rate. We assume that the exchange rate at all dates other than the retrenchment state is
one, and can fall to e < 1 in the retrenchment state. Henceforth, when discussing the exchange
rate e, this e refers to the exchange rate in the retrenchment state at date 1.
Given e we can write the borrower’s problem. The utility from choosing K = L F is,


U B = 2( R − r ) L F − l0 ( L F ) − φ × β L F (1 + r )(1 − e) .

(5)

Define ∆ ≡ R − r. The FOC is:


l00 ( L F ) = 2∆ − φ × (1 − e)(1 + r ) β0 L F (1 + r )(1 − e) .

(6)

Note that ∆ matters in the model, more so than the level of R or r. We henceforth set
r=0

(7)

to simplify some expressions. The term ∆ can be thought of as the carry offered by the EM.
In equilibrium in the retrenchment state, borrowers pledge K units of collateral to raise L F
rupees and exchanges these domestic funds for X F units of dollar. The exchange rate is then,
e=

XF
.
LF

(8)

Throughout out analysis we will assume that parameters are such that e < 1. The exchange
rate expression reflects the fire-sale externality in our model. When a borrower increases date
13

0 borrowing and investment, he pushes up K, which then implies that the date 1 retrenchment
exchange rate is more depreciated, increasing the debt burden (L F (1 − e)) to all borrowers.
Substituting from (8) into (5) above we can write the aggregate borrower utility as


F
F
F
F
2∆L − l0 ( L ) − φ × β L − X
.
This aggregate corresponds to a welfare function for borrowers who account for the effect of their
borrowing (L F ) on the exchange rate and hence the repayment ability of other borrowers.
The FOC for the aggregate is,


l00 (K ) = 2∆ − φ × β0 L F − X F

(9)

We compare (6) to (9) and see that,
Proposition 1. (Overborrowing)
1. Let L F,priv be the solution to the first order condition in (6), and L F,agg be the solution to (9). Since
1 > 1 − e, the private solution features overborrowing:
L F,priv > L F,agg .
The private choices of K and L F are larger than the coordinated choices.
2. Take the case where β is linear, or not too convex.3 Then, since e is increasing in X F , the private
sector over-borrowing (gap between private and coordinated solution) increases in X F . Central bank
reserves are a form of bailout fund. The larger the bailout fund, the greater is the private sector
borrowing.4
How can borrowers implement the coordinated optimum? In our model there are at least two
solutions. A planner can set a borrowing limit on L F which directly implements the optimum. Or,
the planner can set a tax rate on external borrowing, τ F , so that a borrower who raises L F pays
τ F L F to the planner, who then rebates the funds to the borrowers. With this tax, the borrower
would maximize:


2∆L F − l0 ( L F ) − φ × β L F (1 − e) − τ F L F + T

(10)

where τ F L F is the borrowing tax and T is the lumpsum rebated to the borrower. The optimal tax
is set so that the private FOC is equal to the social FOC. It is straightforward to see that,


τ F = φ × e β 0 L F (1 − e ) .

(11)

3 The caveat is necessary because if reserves are large enough that e approaches one, then the cost of bankruptcy goes

to zero.
4 If we do not assume r = 0, which we have for simplicity, then it can be shown that as r falls and hence ∆ rises, K

and L F rise. Since β (·) is convex, the term β0 L F − X F is increasing in K (and L F ). Thus a lower world interest rate, or
increase in foreign investors’ risk appetite, exacerbates the overborrowing problem. If bankruptcies create spillovers to
un-modeled sectors, via bank losses for example, that are increasing in the amount of bankruptcy, then β is increasing
in K, and the problem is reinforced.

14

The tax is increasing in the probability of the foreign run state, φ. It is also increasing in the

expected marginal deadweight cost of the retrenchment state, e × β0 L F (1 − e) , which we note is
itself increasing in L F . Our result that capital flow taxes on EM borrowers can beneficially correct
an over-borrowing problem is similar to Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2004) and Jeanne and
Korinek (2010).

3.2

Optimal reserve holdings and taxes

We next study the central bank’s holdings of reserves and consider how reserve holdings affects
welfare. Suppose that holding reserves for the central bank comes at a cost κ ( X F ), where κ is an
increasing and convex function of X F . We take this cost in reduced form. We can think there are
other forms of capital flows, say FDI or equity, that the central bank uses to accumulate foreign
reserves. In this case, κ is the opportunity cost of the alternative activity. Then, consider the
following welfare function:


W ( L F , X F ) ≡ 2∆L F − l0 ( L F ) − φ × β L F − X F − κ ( X F )

(12)

How much X F would a central bank choose knowing that the choice of X F affects L F ? We optimize
over X F given that L F ( X F ). The FOC is,
n

o


L F 0 ( X F ) 2∆ − l00 ( L F ) − φ × β0 L F − X F
+ φβ0 L F − X F − κ 0 ( X F ) = 0 .
The term in brackets {·} can be simplified using the private FOC, (6). We find:




− L F 0 ( X F ) × φ × e β0 L F − X F + φ × β0 L F − X F − κ 0 ( X F ) = 0
so that,


φβ0 L F − X F =

κ0 (X F )
.
(1 − eL F 0 ( X F ))

(13)

It is instructive to compare this expression to the case where the central bank can directly choose
L F . In that case, the term in the brackets {} goes to zero so that the FOC is,


φβ0 L F − X F = κ 0 ( X F ) .

(14)

In this latter case, the intuition for the choice of X F is clear. The marginal cost of reserves is
increasing in κ 0 and the marginal benefit of holding reserves is the reduction in expected default

cost φβ0 L F − X F . The optimal holding of reserves equates these two margins.
In the former case, when the private sector chooses L F , the cost of reserves is higher. Algebraically we can see it is higher since 1 − eL F 0 ( X F ) < 1 as e > 0 and L F 0 ( X F ) > 0. Intuitively, the
private sector chooses a higher L F in response to a higher X F . Thus, the effective cost of reserves is
increased from κ 0 to

κ0
.
1−eL F 0 ( X F )

The central bank recognizes that increasing X F provides beneficial
15

insurance but that the private sector will undo some of this beneficial insurance by overborrowing
and increasing L F . The central bank cuts back on its optimal reserve holdings as a result.
To summarize:
Proposition 2. (Complementarity between policy instruments I)
• If the central bank that can directly choose L F via a borrowing limit or external borrowing tax, then
F .
it chooses X F to solve (14). Call this maximized value X∗∗

• If the central bank does not have instruments to directly affect L F , then it chooses X F to solve (13).
Call this maximized value X∗F . We then have that,
F
X∗∗
> X∗F

• With two instruments, taxes and reserves, the central bank can do strictly better than with only one
instrument. The two instruments are complements in the sense that taxing ability allows for more
reserve holdings; likewise, more reserve holdings dictates higher taxes.5

3.3

Heterogeneity among borrowers

We extend the model to allow for heterogeneity. Suppose that in a retrenchment shock some firms
are more exposed than others. In particular suppose that the probability a given firm will suffer
loss of funding in the retrenchment shock is pi where i indexes borrowers. We can think of pi as
capturing the relative safety of a firm. We may expect that larger, more stable, or more exportoriented firms will be less exposed to the retrenchment shock.


l00 ( L F,i ) = 2∆ − φpi × (1 − e) β0 L F,i (1 − e) − τ F,i

The second term on the right-hand side is the externality term. Increased borrowing by i puts
pressure on the exchange rate in proportion to the borrower’s retrenchment exposure pi .
The optimal tax rate is chosen to equate the social and private margins. It is straightforward to
derive that:

the optimal tax rate for two borrowers, i and i0 , we find,
τ F,i
pi

τ F,i

j

p j eβ0 ( L F,j (1 − e))

L F,j

dj = p̄eB

so that,
τ F,i = φpi × p̄eB
which can be readily compared to (11) for the homogeneous borrower case. The optimal tax is
proportional to the pressure caused by borrower-i times the increase in expected bankruptcy cost
caused by the additional borrowing.
The central implication of this analysis is that in general capital flow taxes should be borrower
specific and depend on the fire-sale externality imposed by a given borrower. In many cases, such
contingency is hard to implement. But it is nevertheless the implication of the theory. Indeed, our
analysis implies that if taxes are set positive, but uncontingent on borrower-type, an across-firm
distortion rises. High pi borrowers will over-borrow, will low pi borrowers will underborrow, all
relative to the social optimum.

3.4

Domestic loan market

We return to the homogeneous borrower case but extend the model to introduce a domestic (rupee) loan/bond market at date 0. The market is for borrowing in local currency from either domestic or foreign lenders. Given our focus on foreign lending, we suppress domestic lenders, or
alternatively can think of our modeling as net of the loans from domestic lenders. The date 0 cost
of borrowing on domestic loans is r D > r. The higher rate stems from the possibility of a currency
depreciation, weaker legal protection in the domestic market, higher information requirements to
ensure sound collateral, etc. As noted earlier, we fix the currency to be worth one at date 0 and
in the non-retrenchment state. It may depreciate to e < 1 in the retrenchment state. Additionally,
the cost for a foreign lender to participate in the local market is s, covering the collateral issues
mentioned. Thus, the return to an external lender in the domestic bond market is,

(1 − φ)(1 + r D ) + φ(1 + r D )e − s .
Since foreign lenders can either buy domestic bonds or foreign bonds paying r, the domestic interest rate must satisfy:
r D − r ≈ s + φ (1 − e )

(20)

The domestic spread reflects the cost of lending in the local market, s, and the loss to foreign
lenders due to the exchange rate depreciation in the sudden-stop state. As noted, we set r = 0 so
that the required return on domestic borrowing simplifies to, r D = s + φ(1 − e). A borrower who
agrees to repay L D at date 1 raises
We have described the rate

rD

LD
1+ s + φ (1− e )

at date 0.

on borrowing at date 0. Next, consider date 1. We assume that

in the rollover market at date 1, the cost of domestic borrowing is r rather than r D . Although
asymmetric, this latter assumption serves to simplify some algebraic expressions.
Foreign lenders can lend domestically or externally, and run at date 1 against either type of
debt with probability φ. Define total borrowing as,
K = LF +

LD
1 + s + φ (1 − e )

(21)

where L F is external loans from foreign lenders and L D is domestic loans from foreign lenders.
At date 1, if there is retrenchment shock, borrowers have to come up with L F dollars to repay external debt. They raise L F (1 − e) via domestic loans, and pay for the shortfall via the
bankruptcy/adjustment costs of β(·)
In the domestic loan market, the retrenchment shock also leads to a need for funding. We
assume (symmetrically with the case of external debt) that other domestic lenders are able to step
in and rollover the borrower’s debts. However, the foreign lenders receive their local funds of L D

18

and convert them into dollars since they need to retrench into dollars. This potentially depreciates
the exchange rate:
e=

XF
for e < 1.
LF + LD

(22)

A larger outflow triggers a greater depreciation; and, the central bank can reduce the depreciation by intervening using foreign reserves of X F . Note our symmetric treatment of foreign and
domestic loans. Our model captures a sudden stop as a ”twin crisis” in the sense of Kaminsky
and Reinhart (1999) and Chang and Velasco (2001). A domestic debt crisis triggers an outflow of
capital which adds to a currency crisis.
Given e, the borrowers choose their investment and funding at date 0. They maximize,

This expression highlights the key difference between domestic and foreign borrowing. External
borrowing brings a potential bankruptcy cost of B × L F (1 − e). The borrower bears the retrenchment cost ex-post and accounts for it when making the ex-ante borrowing decision. Domestic
borrowing avoids this cost but requires the higher ex-ante spread of r D = s + φ(1 − e). The lender
bears the retrenchment cost ex-post, and charges for it ex-ante by increasing the domestic spread.




W ( L F , L D , X F ) ≈ 2∆ L F + L D − l0 L F + L D

that we can take

−φ × B × L F (1 − e) − (s + φ(1 − e)) L D − κ ( X F ) .
The central bank chooses ( L F , L D , X F ) to maximize W (·). Differentiating, we have that,

∂L
These two expressions give the marginal value of more domestic loans and foreign loans. Notice
from (22) that

∂e
∂L D

=

∂e
.
∂L F

That is, an extra unit of either domestic or foreign loans results in the

same pressure on the exchange rate and hence has the same fire-sale externality. This is because in
the case of an extra unit of foreign loans, the borrower worsens the fire-sale with the extra unit of
loans. In the case of domestic loans, the lender worsens the fire-sale with the extra unit of domestic
loans. But the marginal fire-sale impact does not depend on the denomination of the loan.6 Then,
the difference in these marginal values is,
∂W
∂W
− D = s + φ (1 − e ) − φ (1 − e ) B .
F
∂L
∂L
Foreign borrowing is socially preferable if the domestic spread s is high and the bankruptcy costs
B are low, otherwise domestic borrowing is preferred.
Next consider implementation of the optimum. Suppose that the spread s is high so that foreign borrowing is preferred to domestic borrowing. How can the central bank implement the
optimum via taxes? This case superficially appears similar to our early analysis. However, there
is a key difference. Increasing taxes on foreign borrowing decreases aggregate borrowing, but
also shifts borrowing to domestic markets. To see this, let us write the borrower’s objective with the
foreign debt tax:




U B ( L F , L D , e) = 2∆ L F + L D − l0 L F + L D − φ × B × L F (1 − e) − (s + φ(1 − e)) L D − τ F L F .
(25)
The derivative of

UB

with respect to the two forms of borrowing are:
∂U B
= 2∆ − l00 (K ) − φ(1 − e) B − τ F
∂L F

and,

∂U B
= 2∆ − l00 (K ) − (s + φ(1 − e)) .
∂L D

As taxes, τ F , increase, the borrower optimally chooses lower foreign borrowings L F . However if,
φ (1 − e ) B + τ F > s + φ (1 − e )
the borrower takes no external loans and shifts fully to domestic borrowing. At this point, the tax
policy is completely ineffective.
6 In our formulation L F and L D appear symmetrically in equation (22). But it is also plausible that a unit of external
borrowing applies more pressure on the exchange rate in the sudden stop state. In this case, the external borrowing
carries a higher externality than the domestic borrowing, analogous to our study of heterogeneity among borrowers.
We set this effect aside because it is not central to our conclusions. For an analysis of the issue, see Caballero and
Krishnamurthy (2003).

20

We account for this substitution effect by placing an additional constraint on the central bank.
The central bank maximizes (24) subject to a constraint on taxes:
τ F ≤ s + φ (1 − e ) − φ (1 − e ) B .

(26)

The final result of the analysis is that the tax constraint can be relaxed. Suppose that the central
bank can also tax domestic borrowing. Then, the tax constraint becomes,
τ F ≤ τ D + s + φ (1 − e ) − φ (1 − e ) B .

(27)

We highlight this result as:
Proposition 4. (Complementarity between policy instruments II)
Domestic borrowing taxes, external borrowing taxes and holdings of foreign reserves are complimentary
policy tools. With the ability to level a tax on domestic borrowing, the central bank can decrease aggregate
borrowing without distorting the balance between foreign and domestic borrowing, resulting in a higher
welfare for the economy.

Macroprudential measures deployed in India

India has deployed a range of macro-prudential measures to contain the impact of sudden stops
and reversals of foreign capital flows and the concomitant shocks to the financial and real sector.
Many of these measures had been in place prior to the taper tantrum; however, the taper tantrum
led to a further revision in their nature, as explained below. In this section, we discuss these
measures through the lens of our theoretical model of optimal capital controls.
India has three principal kinds of external debt once various forms of government debt from
multilateral agencies, as well as non-resident Indian deposits, are excluded (the latter have usually
been a source of stability for India during stress episodes): Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in
domestic debt (in both Government of India securities at center and state level, as well as corporate
bonds); External Commercial Borrowings (ECB), which are typically loans to Indian corporations,
quasi-government entities or private firms, denominated in foreign currency; and, introduced
most recently, the Rupee Denominated Bonds (RDB) or ”Masala bonds” issued overseas, again by
quasi-government entities or private firms, typically listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Net investments (stock in Panel A, flow in Panel B) in these various segments of external debt
are plotted over time in Figure 8. The ECB contributed to the bulk of such external debt flows
until the taper tantrum, after which time the FPI debt flows have overtaken as the most significant component. It is also worth pointing out the growth in the Masala Bond in 2017 as ECB
borrowings fall. This switch in the nature of external debt is also reflected in Table 2 which shows
that the foreign currency denominated external debt has steadily declined since 2014 while the
21

INR-denominated component has grown. We will discuss this substitution pattern in terms of
Proposition 4.
Macro-prudential capital controls with regard to these different forms of external debt are
briefly explained below, placing the various controls into broad categories so as to interpret them
in terms of our model’s normative implications:

Caps on exposure to global shocks

These are presently in the form of absolute size limits on (i) total FPI in domestic securities by
asset class, with separate limits for Government of India securities (G-secs), State Development
Loans (SDL), and Corporate bonds, amounting to around $39 billion, $6 billion, and $36 billion,
respectively, or a total of about $80 billion across the three asset categories; and on (ii) ECBs and
Masala bonds together, amounting to a total of about $130 billion.
From the standpoint of our model, the aggregate short-term external liability that cannot be
rolled over relative to the forex reserves of the country is what matters for macroeconomic outcomes in the sudden stop state. Moreover, the complementarity perspective of our model indicates
that borrowing limits should be closely tied to the central bank’s holdings of foreign reserves.
In practice, the limits discussed have either been set as a percentage of the underlying marketsize (as in the case of the G-sec and SDL limits), or set as an absolute number (as in the case
of corporate debt limits). In both cases, roll-out of the limits has been calibrated over quarters,
i.e., gradually, presumably based on considerations outside of our model such as implications of
capital inflows on the exchange rate. Our analysis suggests that optimal limits should depend on
stocks of debt rather than flows. They should also be contingent on central bank reserve holdings.
That being said, there are several aspects to these limits which conform to the model’s implications. In particular, there are limits by investor and by borrower- or issuer-type, as well as
restrictions on nature of the debt. These aspects have evolved over time given India’s experience
with external sector vulnerability. We discuss these aspects next.

Restrictions on investors by their horizon of investment

Within FPI limits for G-sec, SDLs and corporate bonds, there are sub-limits by investor type as
shown in Table 3, in particular, for Long Term versus General investors, where Long Term includes
Insurance firms, Endowments and Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Central Banks, and
Multilateral Agencies; whereas General covers all other qualified institutional investors. The Long
Term category has been added to the corporate bonds limit only since October 2017. Prior to July
2017, the unutilized portion of the Long Term category was transferred to the General category, a
feature that has since been removed.
These investor-specific investment restrictions can be understood in terms of Proposition 3. We
showed that limits should be type-dependent, where type referred to borrower. By extension, it
follows that limits should optimally depend on investor horizon to the extent that the immediacy
demanded by short-term investors (typically carry traders) creates a fire-sale externality in the
sudden stop state. There is no obvious rationale within our model, however, for the transfer of
unutilized long-term limits to short-term investors as this would over time increase the short-term
investor limit towards the overall limit, as indeed has been the case for India.
Interestingly, FPI restrictions in the past also included sub-limits for 100% debt funds as against
minimum 70:30 equity-debt investment ratio funds. In addition, there were minimum lock-in
periods of up to three years on investors once they purchased Indian debt securities. While such
restrictions would also find support under our model as ways to limit the type of short-term
external debt, these have over time been replaced entirely by investor categories based on horizon
(Long Term vs General) and minimum maturity restrictions (which we explain below).
Counter to our theoretical analysis, long-term investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds were not allowed by India to be eligible lenders in ECBs until
2015. There is, however, an indirect policy attempt to ensure that the sudden stop risk does not directly affect the domestic banks (who have significant deposit liabilities), a feature that our model
24

would support. This is achieved by disallowing the refinancing of ECBs by Indian banks as well as
preventing the underlying ECB exposure to be guaranteed by Indian banks, financial institutions
or non-bank financial companies (NBFCs).7

4.3

Restrictions on maturity of the underlying investment

Presently, FPIs are disallowed altogether from investing in liquid short-term money-market debt
instruments such as Treasury bills or commercial paper (CP). Prior to the taper tantrum however
(November 2013 to be precise), there was a carve-out for FPI investments in Treasury Bills and CP,
as shown in Table 4. Since the taper tantrum, India has introduced even tighter restrictions in the
form of residual maturity restrictions of investments by FPIs in debt holdings to be of minimum
three years of maturity at origination or purchase. If one assumes that the arrival of the sudden
stop state is exogenous, as in our model, then these restrictions are potentially effective ways of
limiting short-term external debt in case such a state materializes.8

A similar rationale for limiting the maturity of underlying external debt also exists for ECBs.
Following the taper tantrum, policies were revised in November 2015 to require that a borrower
could undertake an ECB of up to $50 million (foreign currency denominated under the so-called
Track-I of ECB, or INR denominated under Track-III of ECB) with minimum average maturity of
3 years; or up to $50 million if the maturity is 5 years. In contrast, no borrowing limits within the
overall ECB limit is imposed for borrowings meeting a minimum average maturity of 10 years
(for foreign currency denominated borrowing under Track-II of ECB). These maturity restrictions
were not as onerous prior to the taper tantrum.
7 These restrictions on domestic financial institutions were in part also to avoid the ever-greening of non-performing
loans.
8 Another possible rationale for requiring FPIs to hold longer-dated instruments is that it exposes them to greater
interest-rate risk, which could deter excessive presence of short-term investors looking for “carry” by arbitraging
interest-rate differentials with an early exit.

Restricting high liquidity demanders

Our model suggests a Pigouvian form of taxation, wherein borrowers who contribute more to the
fire-sale externality in the sudden stop state are charged a greater tax for taking on short-term
external debt (see Proposition 3). Indian capital controls ensure that only relatively high credit
quality borrowers tap into ECBs by (i) imposing coupon ceilings by debt issue, and (ii) carving
out sub-limits on investments in risky instruments such as unlisted corporate bonds and security
receipts (a form of distressed asset resolution instrument), as well as (iii) ruling out excessive
correlated liquidations by having investment sub-limits by sector. These restrictions limit ECBs
to high-rated borrowers, as suggested by our model. However, this form of differential taxation
does not exist for domestic debt issuances purchased by the FPIs, except to the extent that the
current market-practice in the domestic corporate debt market is to fund only relatively highrated investment-grade borrowers.

Closest to the model are the all-in-cost (AIC) issuance cost ceilings for ECBs which prescribe
that borrowers in the 3 year to 5 year range cannot issue ECBs at a coupon of 6-month LIBOR
+ ceiling as indicated in Table 5. A higher ceiling applies for issuances greater than 5 year maturity. These ceilings have evolved over time in a somewhat counter-cyclical manner relative to
the evolution of 6-month LIBOR (Figure 9): as global interest rates eased post the global financial
crisis, the coupon ceilings were raised, and with global rates tightening since 2015, the ceilings
were lowered.

4.5

Regulatory arbitrage between domestic and overseas external debt:

India permitted ECB borrowings denominated in Rupees (Track III) in September 2014. For macroprudential reasons and as ECBs were envisioned as bilateral loan arrangements, they faced various tenor and all-in-cost constraints, end-use requirements, and eligibility requirements on borrowers and lenders, etc., as explained above. Borrowings under Track III were, however, not
subject to cost caps that applied to other ECBs, as the borrowing was considered as not subject to
exchange rate risk. It is unclear as per our model if this is necessarily the correct distinction since

there is still the sudden stop risk on rollover of rupee-denominated ECBs. Nevertheless, the scope
of eligible borrowers and lenders remained similarly restrictive as for dollar ECBs.
To widen the international investor base for corporates, an additional route of Rupee Denominated Bonds (RDB), or, Masala bonds, was introduced in September 2015. Since these were intended to be bonds issued under market discipline, they were subject to a more relaxed regulatory
regime. Most important of these is the much wider scope of eligible borrowers (any corporate or
body corporate including real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and infrastructure investment
trusts, or InvITs), eligible investors (any investor from FATF compliant jurisdictions), and end-use
(no restrictions except for a small negative list). Masala bonds also had an advantage vis--vis the
FPI route in domestic bonds insofar as investors in Masala bonds did not have to register in India
and the bonds were issued in international finance centers such as London with well-established
financial and legal infrastructure. Further, there was no listing requirement for Masala Bonds. FPI
investments were subsequently allowed in unlisted instruments, but were subjected to a cap.
As noted, at the inception of this market, Masala bonds were viewed by regulators as bond
market borrowings similar to other FPI investments. They received a liberal regulatory treatment
under the presumption that these bonds would have transparent pricing and other forms of market discipline. In actual practice, many Masala bond issuances were essentially bilateral loans
issued as bonds, often to related entities. Coupon rates in many instances had no linkage with

27

market borrowing rates and varied from exttemely low rates (related party transactions to circumvent ECB and FDI restrictions) to high rates (to circumvent the all-in-cost ceilings under the
ECB route). Complicated structures using Masala bonds were also used to by-pass ECB cost caps.
The overall evidence from issuances suggested that many entities were exploiting the relaxed regulatory treatment of Masala bonds to bypass ECB norms on bilateral funding arrangements.
Recognizing this regulatory arbitrage between ECB and Masala bonds, and recognizing that
both were vulnerable to sudden stops because the source of capital was foreign creditors, India
chose to harmonise their regulations. In June 2017, the RBI prescribed cost caps (Treasury yield
+ 300 bps) as well as minimum maturity period for Masala bonds (3 or 5 years, depending on
the issue size). The minimum maturity period also harmonized the Masala bond investments by
foreign creditors to the restrictions on FPI in domestically issued debt. Masala bonds were also
not allowed to be issued to related entities. Such harmonization, and the observed regulatory
arbitrage by issuers and investors in the pre-harmonization period, reinforce the importance of
setting capital flow management policy based on the entirety of an EM’s tools.

Conclusion

We have analyzed the macroprudential use of reserves and capital controls to manage sudden
stops in EMs. Our principal conclusion is that these tools are complements. Hoarding reserves is
beneficial against sudden stops, but creates incentives for the private sector to undo the insurance
offered by reserve holdings. In this context, limits on borrowing increase the efficacy of reserve
holdings. Our complementarity perspective also implies that the optimal holding of reserves depends on the set of policy instruments available to affect private borrowings. Optimal reserve
holdings are increasing in the efficacy of such instruments.
In his classic analysis of policy instruments, Poole (1970) studies the use of the money supply
and interest rate as instruments to stabilize output. In his baseline, both money supply and interest rate are equally effective instruments: they are substitutes. This leads to the result that either
can be used as instrument. He then considers the case where there is some slippage in the transmission mechanism that varies across the instruments. In this case, he shows that the low slippage
instrument should be used more, while the high slippage instrument used less, to stabilize output.
The complementarity logic for managing capital flows turns this result around. We show that
the efficacy of one instrument (reserves) depends on the use of the other (capital flow taxes). Then
as the slippage in one instrument falls, both instruments should be used more, rather than just the
low-slippage instrument.
Where does this end? We have studied three instruments, but what if there 50 instruments
available to the central bank, some of which are more effective than others. Should the central

28

bank use all 50 of these instruments? Should it use some more than others? Suppose that the
central bank is only able to use three out of the 50 instruments; either implementation challenges
or slippage issues in the other instruments render them unusable. Our perspective implies that
it should use less of the three instruments than in the case where all instruments are used. Complementarity implies that the marginal effectiveness of an instrument is increasing in the use of
others. This is the main lesson from our analysis.
