Tax Multipliers: Pitfalls in Measurement and Identification

NBER Working Paper No. 18497
October 2012, Revised April 2015

ABSTRACT
We contribute to the literature on tax multipliers by analyzing the pitfalls in identification and measurement
of tax shocks. Our main focus is on disentangling the discussion regarding the identification of exogenous
tax policy shocks (i.e., changes in tax policy that are not the result of policymakers responding to output
fluctuations) from the discussion related to the measurement of tax policy (i.e., finding a tax policy
variable under the direct control of the policymaker). For this purpose, we build a novel value-added
tax rate dataset and the corresponding cyclically- adjusted revenue measure at a quarterly frequency
for 14 industrial countries for the period 1980-2009.
On the identification front, our findings favor the use of narratives à la Romer and Romer (2010) to
identify exogenous fiscal shocks as opposed to the identification via SVAR. On the (much less explored)
measurement front, our results strongly support the use of tax rates as a true measure of the tax policy
instrument as opposed to widely-used, revenue-based measures, such as cyclically-adjusted revenues.
While tax multipliers tend to be very small (in absolute value) or even positive when using cyclicallyadjusted revenues, they are significantly negative (i.e., tax policy is contractionary) when using tax
rates.

Introduction

In the aftermath of the global nancial crisis and ensuing recession triggered by the fall of Lehman
Brothers on September 15, 2008, many governments across the world implemented aggressive countercyclical scal policies. More recently, large scal de cits and concerns about debt sustainability
in industrial countries, particularly in Europe, have shifted the tone of the discussion from stimulus
to scal adjustment. Since then  and following the inuential paper by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990)
 there has also been a revival of studies suggesting the possibility that scal adjustments might
have no e¤ect on output, or be even expansionary, especially when driven by spending cuts.1 As
a result of the policy focus rst on scal stimulus and later on scal consolidation, there has also
been a ourishing of studies estimating scal multipliers, both on the spending and the taxation
side.
The main challenge and point of contention among researchers has been how to address the
possible endogeneity of scal policy or, to put it di¤erently, how to identify scal policy shocks (i.e.,
changes in scal policy variables that are not directly or indirectly related to output changes). Two
main approaches have been used to address these endogeneity problems:
1. One strand of the literature has followed the seminal contribution of Blanchard and Perotti
(2002) by imposing short term restrictions in the context of structural vector autoregressions
(SVAR). On the expenditure side, the Blanchard-Perotti approach assumes that discretionary
government spending requires at least one quarter to respond to news about the state of the
economy.

On the taxation side, the output elasticity of tax revenues is used to di¤eren-

tiate discretionary changes in taxation (also referred to as changes in cyclically-adjusted
revenues) from those driven by endogenous reactions of tax revenues to output uctuations.
The Blanchard-Perotti approach is by far the most popular identi cation strategy due to its
ease of implementation and data availability (e.g., Perotti, 2004; Favero and Giavazzi, 2007;
Mountford and Uhlig, 2009; Favero and Giavazzi, 2010; Ilzetzki, 2011; and Ilzetzki, Mendoza,
and Vegh, 2013). This strategy has been criticized on the basis that most changes in government spending and taxes are actually anticipated by agents (e.g., Ramey and Shapiro,
1998; Leeper, Walker, and Yang, 2008; Ramey, 2011; Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2011;
and Riera-Crichton, Vegh, and Vuletin, 2015).

(2010), and IMF (2010).

2. Another strand of the literature has developed around the so-called natural experiment
approach. This identi cation strategy assumes that some exogenous changes in scal policy
are, in fact, observable. On the spending side, studies have typically focused on particular
spending categories, such as military buildups, that are unlikely to respond to output uctuations (e.g., Barro, 1981; Ramey and Shapiro, 1998; Hall, 2009; Ramey, 2011; and Barro
and Redlick, 2011). On the taxation side, Romer and Romer (2010), hereafter RR, use the
narrative record  such as presidential speeches and congressional reports  to identify, on a
case-by-case basis, the nature of legislated federal tax changes in the United States from 1945
to 2007. RR identify tax changes exogenous to the business cycle, either because they were
passed for long-run growth reasons or involve increases seeking to reduce an inherited budget
de cit. On tax changes induced by long-run growth considerations, they argue that: [t]he
quintessential exogenous change might be a tax cut motivated by a belief that lower marginal
tax rates will raise output in the long run. Such an action is fundamentally di¤erent from
the countercyclical actions [...] because the goal is to raise normal growth, not to o¤set shocks
acting to reduce growth relative to normal. Regarding de cit-driven tax changes, they argue that [a]n inherited de cit reects past economic conditions and budgetary decisions, not
current conditions or spending changes. If policymakers raise taxes to reduce such a de cit,
this is not a change motivated by a desire to return growth to normal or to prevent abnormal
growth. So it is exogenous.
Our paper contributes to the literature on tax multipliers.

Building on the above discussion

on identi cation, we revisit the merits of the SVAR versus the natural experiment approach.2
To implement the latter, we use as our starting point the action-based scal consolidation episodes
identi ed by an IMF study in 15 industrial countries for the period 1980-2009 and then develop
our own narrative to ensure exogeneity. This strategy is in the spirit of RRs identi cation of tax
changes driven by inherited scal de cits.
Our main and novel contribution, however, is related to the much less explored issue of measurement of tax policy (i.e., nding a tax policy variable under the direct control of the policymaker).
As discussed in Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) and Vegh and Vuletin (2012), an obvious, yet
critical, observation is that policymarkers main tax instrument is the tax rate. While policymakers
control and legislate on tax rates, tax revenues are a policy outcome not under the policymakers
2

In this dimension, our paper is thus related to the recent contribution of Mertens and Ravn (2013).

direct control. To x ideas, de ne real tax revenues (R) as follows:
Rt = T AX RAT Et  T AX BASEt :
where T AX BASEt denotes the real tax base.

(1)

The policymaker controls T AX RAT E but not

T AX BASE and, hence, does not control R.3 Taking logarithmic changes, it follows from equation
(1) that
rt

rt

1

= (tax ratet

tax ratet

+ (tax baset

tax baset

1) ;

(2)

where r, tax rate, and tax base are the log of real tax revenues (R), tax rate (T AX RAT E), and
the real tax base (T AX BASE), respectively. Equation (2) indicates that the percentage change
in tax revenues (rt  rt

rt

1)

tax rate (tax ratet  tax ratet
baset  tax baset

tax baset

can be decomposed into the sum of the percentage change in the
tax ratet

1)

and the percentage change in the tax base (tax

1 ).

Given the lack of readily-available cross country data on tax rates, the standard measure utilized in the tax multiplier literature to capture discretionary changes in tax policy is the so-called
cyclically-adjusted revenues (e.g., Giavazzi and Pagano, 1990; Alesina and Perotti, 1997; Blanchard and Perotti, 2002; Alesina and Ardagna, 2010; Favero and Giavazzi, 2010; Perotti, 2011; and
Ilzetzki, 2011). The change in cyclically-adjusted revenues is typically calculated as:
cyclically-adjustedt = rt

rt

1

 (yt

yt

1) ;

(3)

where y is the log of real output and  is the historical (i.e., average) output elasticity of tax
revenues.

The

rst two terms on the right-hand side of (3) denote the percentage change in

tax revenues. The third term aims at capturing the percentage change in tax revenues associated
with GDP-driven changes in the tax base.

In principle, this cyclically-adjusted measure o¤ers

an intuitive way of dealing with the fact that the tax base moves endogenously with the business
cycle.

The idea is, of course, that once tax revenues are cyclically-adjusted, changes will reect

the discretionary action of policymakers. Indeed, assuming that tax baset =   yt , it follows that
cyclically-adjustedt = tax ratet .4;5 In other words, cyclically-adjusted revenue changes seem
to capture discretionary changes in tax policy (i.e. changes in tax rates).
3

This concern is particular to tax policy, since goverment spending is, in principle, the appropriate policy instrument
on the spending side.
4
Assuming that tax baset =   yt implies, of course, that  is the elasticity of the tax base with respect to GDP.
5
To see this, replace (2) in (3) and use the fact that tax baset =   yt .

4

While appealing at rst, revenue-based measures of tax policy, such as cyclically-adjusted revenues, su¤er from important measurement errors. Mirroring the discussion in the growth literature
on the Solow residual, the cyclically-adjusted measure implicitly attributes any change in revenues
not associated with the estimated change in the tax base to policymakers discretionary behavior.

This source of measurement error would include, among many others, structural breaks,

non-linearities and/or changes in agents behavior over the business cycle, changes in  over time,
changes in taxpayers willingness/possibility to evade taxes, and changes in income distribution.
In sum, there is no good substitute for obtaining data on tax rates themselves when it comes
to measuring changes in the tax policy instrument.

To this e¤ect  and to assess the practical

relevance of this measurement issue we build a novel tax rate dataset and the corresponding
cyclically-adjusted revenue measure and compare the implications in terms of the size of the tax
multiplier. Given the lack of readily-available data on average marginal individual and/or corporate
income tax rates for this group of countries, we focus our e¤orts on building a new quarterly VAT
rate series. Our sample includes 14 industrial countries for the period 1980-2009.6
Table 1 summarizes our analysis regarding the identi cation of exogenous scal policy shocks
(i.e., scal policy changes that are not the result of policymakers responding to output uctuations)
as separate from problems related to the measurement of tax policy (i.e., nding a tax policy variable
under the direct control of the policymaker).
IN SERT T ABLE 1 HERE
Our main results can be summarized as follows:
1. Identi cation of tax shocks (i.e., natural experiment versus SVAR): Our ndings clearly
suggest that the natural experiment approach is the more accurate strategy to identify
exogenous scal shocks.

As in RR, we show that when using SVAR as our identi cation

strategy, various tax series respond signi cantly to output uctuations. These results support
previous critiques of the Blanchard-Perotti identi cation, suggesting that the, presumably,
unanticipated changes in scal policy (at a one quarter horizon) may actually be anticipated
by agents. In contrast, when using exogenous scal consolidation episodes as the identi cation
strategy, we show that tax series do not respond to output uctuations.

These

ndings

validate the natural experiment approach since tax changes do not seem to be driven by

policymakers short-run reactions to GDP uctuations.
2. Measurement of tax policy (i.e., cyclically-adjusted revenues versus tax rates): Our ndings
strongly support the use of changes in tax rates as a measure of tax policy. Indeed, we show
that cyclically-adjusted revenues consistently fail to proxy for changes in tax rates. In fact,
in more than 70 percent of the countries, cyclically-adjusted revenue changes are negatively
autocorrelated at the quarterly frequency. This would indicate (under the common presumption that this measure proxies for changes in discretionary tax policy) that policymakers
discretionary policy changes are reversed every quarter!

Not surprisingly, these measure-

ment di¤erences have important implications for tax multipliers.

Multipliers based on tax

rate increases are always negative (i.e., tax policy is contractionary). In sharp contrast, tax
multipliers based on cyclically-adjusted revenues are close to zero or even positive.
3. Most recent tax studies (e.g., Favero and Giavazzi, 2010; Caldara, 2011; and Ilzetzki, 2011)
rely on SVAR and cyclically-adjusted revenue changes (bottom-right cell in Table 1). In line
with most of these papers, when using this identi cation strategy we nd that tax multipliers
are not negative. In fact, a one unit increase in tax revenues raises output by 0.19 on impact
and 0.80 after four quarters. When focusing on exogenous scal consolidation and cyclicallyadjusted revenue changes (top-right cell in Table 1), tax multipliers also tend to be positive
(i.e., tax policy is expansionary). When using SVAR and changes in tax rates (bottom-left
cell in Table 1), tax multipliers are negative (i.e., tax policy is contractionary). The multiplier
is -0.31 on impact and -1.17 after three quarters. When using exogenous scal consolidation
and tax rate changes (top-left cell in Table 1), tax multipliers are strongly negative. A one
unit revenue increase shock reduces output by 0.66 on impact and 3.56 after three quarters.
This wide range of results shows the importance of the strategy used to identify exogenous
scal shocks and, more importantly for our purposes, the measurement of tax policy.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses data and identi cation. Section
3 computes tax multipliers using exogenous scal consolidation episodes (to identify exogenous scal
shocks) and tax rates (to measure tax policy) and performs numerous robustness tests.

Section

4 examines the implications of alternative empirical strategies regarding the identi cation of tax
shocks and measurement of tax policy. Section 5 concludes.

Data and identi cation

After introducing our dataset on VAT taxation, this section discusses our main identi cation strategy.7 We close this section by presenting our cyclically-adjusted data and comparing it to our data
on tax rate changes.

2.1

VAT data

Our VAT dataset covers 14 industrial countries at a quarterly frequency for the period 1980-2009.8
Overall  and as depicted in Figure 1  we have 42 changes in the VAT rate (32 increases and 10
reductions). Excluding zeros, the median tax rate change is 1 percentage point and the average is
0.7 percentage points. The largest tax rate reduction and tax rate increase are 3.5 and 3 percentage
points, respectively. For the same group of countries (though sample periods di¤er depending on
data availability), we also obtained data for VAT revenues (for the purposes, as discussed below, of
computing cyclically-adjusted revenues).

2.2

Identi cation of exogenous scal consolidation VAT rate changes

Our narrative-based empirical strategy relies on the identi cation of scal consolidation episodes
carried out in the October 2010 World Economic Outlook by the IMF, which covers the period
1980-2009.

Examining a variety of documents (including OECD Economic Surveys, IMF Sta¤

Reports, IMF Recent Economic Developments reports, country budget documents, and additional
country-speci c sources), this IMF study characterizes a scal consolidation episode as a situation
in which the government implemented tax hikes, [...] or spending cuts [...] to reduce the budget
de cit and put public nances on a more sustainable footing (IMF, 2010, page 96).
As a rst approximation, it would seem natural to view changes in the VAT rate associated
with the scal consolidation episodes identi ed by the IMF (2010) as exogenous to the business
cycle (i.e., to quarterly changes in GDP in our case) since such tax changes are presumably part
of a scal package primarily designed to deal with chronic or inherited budget de cits. There are
two scenarios, however, in which this exogeneity assumption may not be valid (in which case the

See Appendix 6.1 for data sources and sample periods. The countries included are Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. We did
not include in the analysis other long-standing OECD countries because they are not included in the IMF (2010)
study that identi es scal consolidation episodes. This IMF study covers 15 countries (the 14 countries listed above
and the United States) for the period 1980-2009. We did not include the United States in our sample because it does
not have a federal VAT. The VAT rate for Canada corresponds to the federal VAT rate.

underlying identi cation strategy would not be correct). First, because of potential links between
the current scal balance and tax policy. Speci cally, it seems plausible that a sudden (i.e., within
the quarter) and large change in the scal balance may trigger a change in the VAT rate in the
same quarter.

This could take the form of a sudden deterioration in the scal balance caused

by a fall in economic activity that induces an increase in the VAT rate to close the

scal gap,

or a sudden improvement in the scal accounts that triggers a reduction in tax rates for political
economy considerations. Second, an increase in the VAT rate aimed at o¤setting other factor(s)
that would tend to move output growth away from normal. These factors may include (i) a cut
in other tax rates (e.g., a reduction in the employers contributions to social security) and/or (ii)
additional public spending (e.g., job creation programs).
In light of these two possible scenarios  and following the narrative approach  we further
analyze the nature of the 19 VAT rate changes that occurred in the episodes of scal consolidation
identi ed by the IMF (hereafter  scal consolidation tax rate changes).9 Bearing in mind the rst
concern raised above, we evaluate whether the narrative supports the idea of changes in VAT rates
triggered by a sudden scal deterioration (improvement) resulting from a downturn (upturn) in
economic activity, in which case we classify the change as endogenous. Regarding the second type
of concern, we evaluate whether the narrative supports the idea of increases in VAT rates intended
to o¤set the expansionary e¤ects of government spending or other tax cuts (not included in our set
of controls), in which case we also classify the change as endogenous. In contrast, when changes in
VAT rates during episodes of scal consolidation were motivated by inherited scal de cits and/or
medium and long term solvency problems, we classify them as exogenous.
Table 2 summarizes the results of our analysis for the 19 scal consolidation tax rate changes.10
The table indicates country name (Column 1), date of implementation of the tax change (Column
2), change (in percentage points) of the VAT rate (Column 3), a brief narrative and a binary classi cation into endogenous and exogenous (Column 4), Lastly, column 5 shows (only for exogenous
scal consolidation VAT rate changes) the date of passage of the law mandating the change in the
VAT rate, which will be instrumental in evaluating (in Subsection 3.4) the role of expectations in
the computation of tax multipliers.
IN SERT T ABLE 2 HERE
9
More precisely, we match our sample of VAT rate changes to the IMFs sample of scal consolidation episodes,
and look at the intersection of the two (i.e., scal consolidation episodes in which the VAT rate changed).
10
The detailed narrative underlying Table 2 can be found in Appendix 6.3.

8

Based on our narrative analysis, Table 2 identi es 75 percent (14 out of 19) of the scal consolidation VAT rate changes as exogenous to short-run output uctuations. Most of the endogenous
scal consolidation VAT rate changes (4 out of 5) correspond to cases where the VAT rate hike
was part of a scal consolidation package that was also intended to stimulate economic activity by
reducing other taxes, such as social security contributions. In one case (France in 2000), the VAT
rate reduction was triggered by the idea that low de cits made it possible to lower existing (and
high) tax rates.

In Section 3, we will use these 14 exogenous tax rate changes to compute tax

multipliers.

2.3

Cyclically-adjusted revenues

Figure 2 plots both the VAT rate and VAT cyclically-adjusted revenue changes for each of our 14
countries.11 The changes in VAT cyclically-adjusted revenues have been computed using expression
(3), quarterly VAT revenue, quarterly output growth data, and estimated values of  for indirect
taxation from van den Noord (2000).12 Three features are worth noting:
1. While VAT rate changes are discrete in nature and zero most of the time, VAT cyclicallyadjusted revenue changes show, by construction, a continuous-variable pattern.
2. The contemporaneous correlation between changes in cyclically-adjusted revenues and the tax
rate is very low (0.04) and not signi cantly di¤erent from zero.13 Even when tax rate changes
are not zero, the contemporaneous correlation between changes in cyclically-adjusted revenues
and the tax rate is rather low (0.21) and not signi cantly di¤erent from zero. If we restrict
our comparison to exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes, the correlation is -0.05 and
not signi cantly di¤erent from zero.
3. We complement our analysis by looking at some basic dynamic properties of the cyclicallyadjusted measure, which helps us in understanding some inherent weaknesses of this revenuebased measure. Speci cally, Figure 2 reports two statistics for each country (see bottom note
11

Note that Figure 2 has been plotted for the common sample period and hence may not coincide with the sample
period in Figure 1.
12
See Appendix 6.1 for details.
13
One possible source of low contemporaneous correlation may be di¤erences in timing. Suppose, for example, that
revenues are turned over to the government with a one-quarter lag. Then there might be a low correlation between the
contemporaneous changes in cyclically-adjusted revenues and the tax rate, but a high correlation between the change
in cyclically-adjusted revenues and the lagged change in the tax rate. This conjecture, however, is not warranted as
the correlation between cyclically-adjusted revenues and lagged tax rates changes (up to four quarters) ranges between
0.07 and 0.0005.

in each panel). The rst is the Ljung-Box test statistic, which tests the null hypothesis that
the data are independently distributed. The second is the autocorrelation coe¢cient ( ) that
results from estimating a simple AR1 process (i.e., cyclically-adjustedt = + cyclicallyadjustedt

1 ).

The rst statistic tells us that in almost 80 percent of the countries (11 out

of 14) the changes in cyclically-adjusted tax revenues are not independently distributed over
time. Moreover, the second statistic tells us that, in more than 70 percent of the countries (10
out of 14), cyclically-adjusted revenue changes are negatively autocorrelated at the quarterly
frequency. This would suggest (under the common presumption that this measure is a proxy
for changes in discretionary tax policy) that policymakers discretionary policy changes are
reversed every quarter!

Since this is clearly highly implausible, it calls into question the

usefulness of cyclically-adjusted revenue changes as a proxy for changes in tax policy.
In Section 4, we will use our full sample of 42 VAT rate changes and our cyclically-adjusted
measures in the context of the Blanchard-Perotti identi cation to argue that, regardless of the
identi cation strategy, cyclically-adjusted revenues are a bad proxy for tax policy.

The e¤ect of exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes on
output

This section studies the e¤ect of exogenous

scal consolidation VAT rate changes on economic

activity. Our two benchmark speci cations indicate that tax increases have a strong negative e¤ect
on output.

We then perform a myriad of robustness tests  alternative error structures, adding

time dummies, changing the timing assumption, controlling for other scal variables, and taking
into account the role of expectations  and conclude that our main results continue to hold in all
cases.

3.1

Benchmark speci cations

We begin our analysis by estimating the e¤ect of tax rate changes on economic activity using, as in
RR, the following basic speci cation:
yi;t =

+

J
P

j=0

j ti;t

10

j

i=1

i di

where J = 4, I = 14, y is the logarithm of real GDP (and y is thus the real GDP growth rate,
expressed as the di¤erence in logarithms), t is the change in tax rate in percentage point terms
and represents exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes,

is a constant term, d is a country

dummy, and  is the error term. In estimating equation (4), we include four lags (i.e., J = 4).14
This approach should yield unbiased reduced-form impact estimates of tax rate changes on
output (see top-left cell in Table 1) given (i) the exogenous nature of tax rate changes and (ii) the
tax variable used is a tax instrument (as opposed to a revenue-based one, such as the cyclicallyadjusted revenue).15
While conceptually appropriate, a drawback of using changes in tax rates as the independent
variable in equation (4) is that the estimated coe¢cients

do not correspond to the usual tax

multiplier for GDP (i.e., the response of GDP to a unit increase in tax revenues). In other words,
the coe¢cients

link the change in GDP to the change in the tax rate and not in tax revenue. To

think in terms of standard multipliers, we de ne the multiplier for time horizon J as
PJ

j=0 Yj

T ax multiplier (J)  PJ

j=0 Rj

16

:

(5)

We compute the tax multiplier de ned above by exploiting the typical relationship of tax revenues
to the tax rate.

Let R be real VAT revenue, Y real output, I implicit VAT rate (de ned as

R=Y ), and e the average relationship between I and t (i.e., e  I=t). Following Barro and Redlick
(2011, pp. 80-81), the tax multiplier at di¤erent time horizons J is then computed as
T ax multiplier (J) =

!J
;
e + ! J  IJ

17

(6)

where ! J represents the cumulative e¤ect on the growth rate of output of a one percentage-point
P
shock in taxes. In the case of speci cation (4), ! J = Jj=0 j . IJ measures the average implicit

14
The selection of four lags balances the need to account for a su¢ciently long structure of lags in order to study the
e¤ect of scal consolidations as well as the need to preserve most of our tax rate changes. Unfortunately, as we move
towards longer lag structures, we are forced to drop data points from an already small set of tax rate changes. Having
said that, our results for the case of eight and twelve lags remain almost the same as in the four quarter speci cation.
The main di¤erence is that the cumulative multiplier becomes more negative starting in the eight quarter. Figures
showing the multipliers for the eight and twelve lag estimations are not shown for the sake of brevity.
15
Given concerns about the non-normal distribution of tax rate changes (which are zero most of the time) and
small sample considerations, standard errors are computed using bootstrap techniques. In particular, standard errors
are calculated from the average of 10,000 draws of the coe¢cient vector from a multivariate normal distribution with
mean and variance-covariance matrix equal to the point estimates and variance-covariance matrix of the regression
coe¢cients.
16
No substantial di¤erence in our results would arise if we discounted by the median real deposit rate.

Figure 3 uses estimates from (4) to illustrate the tax multiplier together with one-standard-error

-3.69 after four quarters.19

As discussed in RR, including lagged growth helps in controlling for

corresponding tax multiplier.20;21 For comparison purposes, this gure also reports the ndings
from the speci cation without GDP growth lags (i.e., speci cation (4)).

Results are virtually

unchanged both in terms of point estimates and precision.

3.2

Robustness tests

We now perform several robustness tests that build upon the speci cation in equation (8).22
18

We use the sample average values of e (38 percent) and the implicit VAT rate (6 percent) for our tax multiplier
calculations. While there is some variation across countries, the variability is fairly small. The standard deviations of
e and the implicit VAT rate are 6 and 2 percent, respectively.
19
Results are virtually not a¤ected if country dummies are not included. Results are not shown for brevity.
20
As in the case of regression (4), standard errors in speci cation (8) are computed using bootstrap techniques.
21
The impulse response function of a shock in taxes in speci cation (8) includes both the direct impact of taxes on
output (captured by the coe¢cients j ) and the indirect cumulative e¤ect trough the lags of output growth (captured
by the coe¢cients n ).
22
Similar results are obtained if we use the rst benchmark speci cation, given by (4). Results are not shown for
the sake of brevity.

Alternative error structure

We rst assume an alternative error structure. Speci cally, Figure 5 shows the results when using
Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors, which allow the error term to be serially and crosssectionally correlated. Our results are not a¤ected.
IN SERT F IGU RE 5 HERE
3.2.2

Time dummies

We then allow for time dummies.

Figure 6 shows that, relative to our benchmark speci cation

with no time dummies, the impact multiplier is marginally larger (in absolute value) on impact,
but remains virtually unchanged afterwards.
IN SERT F IGU RE 6 HERE
3.2.3

Timing

We now look at the issue of timing. As is standard in the literature, our benchmark speci cation 
given by (8)  imputes the tax rate change to the quarter in which it was e¤ectively implemented
(independently of whether such a tax rate change was implemented at the beginning, middle, or
end of the quarter).

One may argue, however, that if the tax rate change was, for example,

implemented towards the end of the quarter, the impact on output should only be observed in the
following quarter. If so, this would bias the multiplier downwards (in absolute value).
Table 2 shows that while more than 70 percent (or 10 out of 14) of exogenous scal consolidation
tax rate changes were implemented in the very rst day of each quarter, more than 20 percent (or
3 out of 14) were implemented in the last month of each quarter.23 Only one tax rate change was
implemented in the second month of the quarter. To account for these instances, Figure 7 shows
the results of an alternative measure of tax rate changes in which tax rate changes implemented in
the last month of a quarter are imputed to the following quarter.24 As we see, the results remain
virtually unchanged.
IN SERT F IGU RE 7 HERE
23

In six episodes, the change in the VAT was implemented on January 1, reecting the start of the new calendar
year.
24
Virtually identical results are obtained if one also imputes the only tax rate change that was implemented in the
second month of a quarter to the following quarter.

13

3.2.4

Two-variable SVAR

Lastly  and following RR  we use a natural variation of speci cation (8): a two-variable pooled
SVAR with real GDP growth and exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes. In keeping with
the regression speci cations on the contemporaneous relationship between tax rate and output,
we allow tax rate changes to a¤ect output contemporaneously but not vice-versa. Of course, the
construction of a narrative identifying exogenous scal consolidation tax rate change makes the use
of an SVAR approach trivial. In other words, as long as the narrative is correct, one would not
need to run a system of equations and make any assumptions about the contemporaneous relation
between exogenous

scal consolidation tax rate changes and real GDP growth rate in order to

identify a scal shock.
Having said that, we follow RR and the literature more generally and still estimate an SVAR for
several reasons: (i) to provide some empirical evidence that will validate our narrative approach
for exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes (i.e., analyze whether exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes are, indeed, unrelated to recent past output uctuations); (ii) to help address
potential endogeneity concerns when including other controls variables, such as government spending; and (iii) to compare our exogenous tax measure with other measures of tax policy changes; in
particular with the commonly used cyclically-adjusted revenue changes.
We now address the rst item (the second will be addressed in Subsection 3.3 and the third in
Section 4). Figure 8 shows the tax multiplier when using the two-variable SVAR.25 We can see
that the multiplier is virtually identical to the one obtained using speci cation (8).26
IN SERT F IGU RE 8 HERE
To empirically validate our narrative approach, Figure 9 shows the impulse response function
of the tax series to a shock in GDP. After a one percent innovation in output, tax rates barely
uctuate between 0.002 and -0.003.

The e¤ect is highly statistically insigni cant at all time

horizons. The p-value for the test of the null hypothesis that output does not Granger-cause the tax
series is 0.96. This nding strongly supports our conjecture that tax rate changes identi ed using
exogenous scal consolidation episodes (i.e., through historical narratives) are, indeed, unrelated to
25

As in (4) and (8), we use four lags in our estimation of the two-variable SVAR .
For the sake of comparison with Figure 8, we restrict the plot to four quarters (since in the case with the single
equation approach the cumulative multiplier beyond period 4 would be constant).

3.3

Controlling for changes in other scal variables

Following RR, we now control for changes in other scal variables such as government spending
and other taxes.

Government spending, of course, may a¤ect output on its own and hence bias

the tax multiplier.

For instance, consider an episode of

scal consolidation where government

spending typically falls at the same time that tax rates increase. Omitting the former would bias
the tax multiplier downwards, giving the false idea that tax rate hikes are more contractionary
than they actually are. The opposite would be true when government spending increases together
with tax rate hikes, perhaps in an attempt to o¤set the potential contractionary e¤ect of tax rate
hikes on output.

Since the data do not show any systematic contemporaneous relation (at a

quarterly frequency) between changes in government spending and tax rates during episodes of
scal consolidation (the correlation is -0.02 and not statistically di¤erent from zero), we do not
expect this potential problem to be an issue, but a formal analysis is clearly warranted.
In order to control for government spending, we use a three-variable SVAR speci cation with
four lags of real GDP growth rate, exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes, and government
spending changes occurring during periods of scal consolidation. In keeping with the regression
speci cations on the contemporaneous relationship between tax rate and output, we allow tax rate
changes to a¤ect output contemporaneously but not viceversa. The same is true for government
spending (i.e., government spending can a¤ect output contemporaneously but not viceversa). As is
common practice, we also assume no contemporaneous relation between government spending and
tax rates.27
Figure 10 shows the results of the three-variable SVAR. The tax multiplier remains virtually
unchanged after controlling for government spending. This was to be expected to the extent that,
as mentioned above, the contemporaneous correlation is essentially zero. While there could still be
some dynamic feedback from changes in tax rates to government spending, Figure 10 suggests that
27

As in Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and Favero and Giavazzi (2007), results remain virtually unchanged when
(contemporaneous e¤ect of government spending on tax rates) and tg (contemporaneous e¤ect of tax rates on
government spending) are estimated using, for example, two dynamic least squares dummy variable regressions with
four lags of tax rates and four lags of government spending in each regression and including these estimates, one at a
time, in the three-variable SVAR analysis ( gt = 0:01 (t = 1:06) and tg = 0:21 (t = 1:10)). Results are not shown
for the sake of brevity.

this not the case either.28
IN SERT F IGU RE 10 HERE
With respect to changes in other taxes, we now control for corporate and individual income
tax rates. Given the lack of readily-available data on average marginal income and corporate tax
rates for the 14 countries used in this study, we use top marginal corporate and individual income
tax rates.

To this e¤ect, we extend our benchmark two-variable SVAR to a four-variable SVAR

speci cation with the real GDP growth rate and exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes
(value-added, corporate, and income).29 Figure 11 shows the tax multiplier with and without these
additional tax rates. The impact e¤ect remains virtually unchanged and the cumulative multiplier
is also virtually the same.
In sum, we conclude that our benchmark results remain essentially unchanged after controlling
for other relevant scal variables.
IN SERT F IGU RE 11 HERE

3.4

The role of expectations

In deriving our measure of tax multipliers, the date of tax changes corresponds to the date in which
they were actually implemented. Expectations, however, could also matter. As discussed in RR
and Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi (2012), announcements may lead to anticipated e¤ects of tax
changes.
To explore this issue, Figure 12 shows the density function for the number of days between
passage and implementation of exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes. The lag between
passage and implementation is relatively short, with a median and average lag of about one and
three months, respectively.
IN SERT F IGU RE 12 HERE
In order to control for possible anticipated e¤ects arising from announcements, we follow RRs
strategy of adding to our previous speci cation, given by equation (8), a news term and its
28

If we included all changes in government spending instead of only those associated with scal consolidation
episodes, the tax multiplier would remain virtually unchanged. These gures are not reported for the sake of brevity.
29
As before, we allow tax rate changes to a¤ect output contemporaneously but not the other way around. We
include four lags of all variables. We also assume that the contemporaneous relations between the di¤erent tax rate
changes in the matrix of endogenous variables are zero. Our results barely change when using estimates from a least
squares dummy variable model. These plots are not shown for brevitys sake.

where J = 4, N = 4, I = 14, and the variable News represents the expected change of the tax
rate at the time of the o¢cial passage of the law. As in the case of the actual tax change, we also
include four lags for the News term. Figure 13 then shows the response of output to the passage
of the law and to the implementation of the law (i.e., the tax multiplier that we have been reporting
above).
Interestingly, Figure 13 shows that, at the time of the passing of the law, output increases.
Most importantly for our purposes, the contractionary e¤ect of tax increases in response to the
implementation of the law remains valid even after we control for scal news.
We conclude that news about tax changes (proxied by the passage of tax laws) seem to lead to
intertemporal substitution e¤ects in the sense that output increases in response to the news even
though it falls when the law is actually implemented.

Our estimates of the tax multiplier itself,

however, remain robust.

Comparison with alternative empirical strategies

This section examines the implications of using alternative empirical strategies for the identi cation
of exogenous scal shocks and tax policy measurement. In terms of Table 1, notice that the analysis
above has dealt exclusively with the top-left cell. This section deals with the cases captured by the
other three cells. For comparison purposes, the plots in this section also report the ndings from
the two-variable SVAR speci cation with exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes illustrated
in Figure 8.30

4.1

Tax rate and Blanchard-Perotti

We rst analyze the implications of using the VAT rate, a tax instrument, and the Blanchard-Perotti
identi cation strategy (bottom-left cell in Table 1).

In other words, we use all tax rate changes

 not only those associated with exogenous scal consolidation episodes  and follow the structure
30

We use as our benchmark the SVAR speci cation in order to have a valid comparison because all of the results
in this section are derived in the context of an SVAR.

proposed by Blanchard and Perotti (2002) to identify scal shocks.31 Figure 14, panels A and B,
displays the results. Panel A shows that the time pro le of the multiplier is quite similar to our
benchmark, but considerably smaller (in absolute value). In particular, the impact e¤ect, while still
contractionary, is halved (i.e., falls in absolute value from 0.66 to 0.31) and is borderline signi cant.
The maximum contractionary e¤ect is reduced to about a third, from 3.56 to 1.29 (in absolute
value). Panel B indicates that tax rate changes tend to respond signi cantly to output changes,
especially after four quarters. The p-value for the test of the null hypothesis that a positive shock
in output does not reduce the tax rate in the fourth quarter is 0.015.

IN SERT F IGU RE 14 HERE
One could argue that the di¤erence in tax multipliers in Figure 14, Panel A, may reect the
asymmetric impact of tax rate changes depending on whether they are tax cuts or hikes.

Since

all of our exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes are tax hikes, we now look at the case in
which we use all positive tax rate changes and follow the Blanchard-Perotti identi cation scheme.32
Panels C and D in Figure 14 display the results. Panel C con rms the ndings in Panel A; that
is, the time pro le of the multiplier is similar to our benchmark but its size (in absolute value) is
much smaller.

4.2

Cyclically-adjusted revenues and narrative

We now address the case captured by the top-right cell in Table 1. In other words, we use VAT
cyclically-adjusted revenue changes as the tax instrument and the exogenous scal consolidation
tax rate changes as our identi cation strategy.33 Since we only include cyclically-adjusted revenue
changes for those quarters with exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes, the exercise truly
compares alternative tax policy measures.34 Panels A and B in Figure 15 display the results. Panel
A shows a pro le for the tax multiplier very di¤erent from the one we have obtained so far.

In

particular, the impact multiplier is very small (borderline zero)  in line with the results in Perotti
(2004), Favero and Giavazzi (2010), Caldara (2011), and Ilzetzki (2011)  and expansionary after
31

Recall that our VAT rate sample includes 42 tax rate changes.
Recall that our sample includes 32 tax rate increases.
33
See Appendix 6.4 for the computation of the multiplier and its standard deviation.
34
Similar results are obtained including cyclically-adjusted revenue changes for the year (as opposed to just the
quarter) with exogenous scal consolidation tax rate changes. In this case, the tax multiplier is much smaller (in
absolute value). Results are not shown for the sake of brevity.

two quarters.35 Interestingly, and in line with our previous results, Panel B seems to empirically
validate the use of exogenous scal consolidation as a means of identifying exogenous scal shocks.
The p-value for the test of the null hypothesis that output does not granger-cause changes in tax
rates is 0.75.

IN SERT F IGU RE 15 HERE

4.3

Cyclically-adjusted revenues and Blanchard-Perotti

Lastly, we focus on VAT cyclically-adjusted revenue changes and the Blanchard-Perotti identi cation
strategy (bottom-right cell in Table 1). As discussed in the Introduction, this strategy is by far
the most commonly used in the literature. Figure 16, panels A and B, display the results. Panel
A provides evidence that (as in panel A in Figure 15) the impact e¤ect on output is not only
non-contractionary, but, in fact, expansionary!

A unit shock increase in VAT revenue collection

increases output by 0.19 on impact and about 0.80 after a year.

IN SERT F IGU RE 16 HERE
Furthermore, when using this revenue-based measure together with the Blanchard-Perotti identi cation strategy, our results indicate that cyclically-adjusted revenue changes tend to respond to
output changes (Panel B). This cast severe doubts on the validity of Blanchard-Perotti as a tool
for identifying scal shocks.

4.4

Implications of our ndings

This sections ndings clearly support our concerns regarding the use of both cyclically-adjusted
revenue measures to determine changes in tax policy as well as the use of econometric structural
assumptions to identify exogenous scal shocks.
In terms of identi cation, our empirical evidence favors the use of natural experiments as a
more accurate way of assessing scal policy changes not resulting from policymakers response to
output uctuations (see Figure 14, panel B for tax rates and panel B in Figures 15 and 16 for
cyclically-adjusted revenues).
35

A notable exception is Mertens and Ravn (2014), who nd large tax multipliers using the narrative approach for
tax changes in the United States.

19

Regarding the (much less explored) issue of measurement of tax policy, we conclude (complementing our ndings from Subsection 2.3) that there is really no good substitute for data on tax
rates.

Our main point  the importance of using tax rates to measure tax policy  is, in fact,

independent of the particular identi cation strategy, as it applies equally to the analysis of scal
shocks identi ed through narratives à la RR and SVAR identi cation à la Blanchard-Perotti. The
critical importance of this issue is reected in the very di¤erent tax multipliers that result. Tax
rate increases are always contractionary (Figure 14, Panels A and C). Tax multipliers based on
cyclically-adjusted revenues, however, are either very small or actually positive (Panel A in Figures
15 and 16), suggesting that tax increases actually raise output. In other words, not using tax rates
may lead to a very misleading value of the tax multiplier.

5

Conclusions

Our paper contributes to the empirical literature on tax multipliers. Speci cally, we rst revisit the
issue of the identi cation of exogenous scal policy shocks (i.e., scal policy changes that are not the
result of policymakers responding to output uctuations). Our ndings support Romer and Romers
(2010) narrative approach as a more convincing strategy than SVAR to truly identify exogenous
scal shocks. We then explore the (rarely addressed) implications of tax policy measurement (i.e.,
obtaining a tax policy variable that is under the direct control of policymakers). For this purpose,
we built a novel value-added tax rate dataset and the associated cyclically-adjusted revenues at
a quarterly frequency for 14 industrial countries for the period 1980-2009.

Our results strongly

support the use of tax rates as a true measure of tax policy as opposed to widely-used revenuebased measures, such as cyclically-adjusted revenues. We conclude that the latter is a poor proxy
for changes in tax rates since it shows a very erratic pattern (on many occasions even implying
that the presumably discretionary policy changes are reversed every quarter!).

Our main point

 the importance of using tax rates as a proxy for tax policy  is, however, independent of the
particular identi cation strategy, as it applies equally to the analysis of

scal shocks identi ed

through narratives à la Romer-Romer as well as to SVAR identi cation.

Tax rate increases are

always contractionary.

However, tax multipliers based on cyclically-adjusted revenues are, as

suggested by some papers in this area, close to zero or even positive.

Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, and United Kingdom introduced
value-added taxation before 1980, so our sample for these countries includes the full 1980-2009
period.
The six remaining countries implemented VAT taxation later: Australia (introduced
in 2000:Q3), Canada (1991:Q1), Finland (1994:Q3), Japan (1989:Q1), and Portugal and Spain
(1986:Q1). As a result, the sample for these countries runs from the quarter of implementation to
1980.
VAT rate series for Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom were obtained from VAT rates applied in the member states
of the European Community, European Commission, Taxation and Customs Union, 2009. Data
for Japan from Beyer (2000) and the TMF group. Data for Canada from Canada Revenue Agency;
data for Australia from Australian Taxation O¢ce.

VAT revenue

Quarterly data for VAT revenue for Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom were obtained from Eurostat. Data for Canada
are from Statistics Canada, Government Finance Statistics Series; data for Japan from Bank of
Japan. For Australia, VAT tax revenue data were not available on a quarterly basis. As a proxy,
we used tax revenues on production and imports from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Income
Component Tables.
Sample periods start as follows: United Kingdon (1990:Q1), Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
France, Germany, and Italy (1991:Q1), Japan and Sweden (1993:Q1), Finland (1994:Q3), Portugal (1991:Q1), Ireland (1999:Q1), Spain (2000:Q1), and Australia (2000:Q3). In all cases, the
sample period ends in 2009:Q4.

Cyclically-adjusted VAT revenue measure

We use equation (3) to compute cyclically-adjusted VAT revenues, with values of  for indirect
taxation computed by van den Noord (2000).37 38 The average elasticity for the countries included
in the sample is 0.9. The individual values are as follows: Australia (0.4), Belgium (0.9), Canada
(0.7), Denmark (1.6), Finland (0.9), France (0.7), Germany (1), Ireland (0.5), Italy (1.3), Japan
(0.5), Portugal (0.6), Spain (1.2), Sweden (0.9), and United Kingdom (1.1). The sample periods
are the same as for tax revenues.

Belgium

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 2 (from 17% to 19%). Date of implementation: January 1, 1983. Date of passage: October 10, 1983. Exogenous.
The government that took o¢ce following the general elections of November 8, 1981 was confronted with a declining GDP, a large external current account de cit, a soaring public sector de cit
(which rose from 12% of GDP in 1980 to 16% of GDP in 1981), sharply rising unemployment, and
37

To calculate this elasticity, van den Noord (2000) assumes that the relevant tax base uctuates in proportion with
private consumption. The elasticity then corresponds to the output elasticity of consumption, which is estimated
for each country using semi-annual data on private consumption and output for the period 1985-1998.

Similar results are obtained if we assumed that  = 1 for all countries (as in Giorno, Richardson, Roseveare, and
van den Noord, 1995). Results are not shown for brevity.

accelerating ination. Various policy measures were adopted that improved the external balance
and corporate pro tability. The scal de cit, however, remained at 16% in 1982 and the public
debt reached 127% of GDP. In early 1982, the government decided to take supplementary measures
aimed at reducing such de cit including the increase of the VAT rate from 17% to 19%. Sources:

Belgiums general government de cit peaked at over 16 percent of GNP in 1981. As a result,
scal policy for the rest of the decade rst focused on stabilizing and then reducing the public
debt ratio. Belgiums 1992 VAT increase was motivated by an interest in harmonizing VAT rates
with other members of the European community and reducing de cits toward the 3% Maastricht
treaty limit. Sources: Belgium to align its VAT, duty Laws with rest of EC. Wall Street Journal

Belgium experienced recessionary conditions in 1993. Although Belgiums scal policy had
focused on reducing de cits to the 3% of GDP level required by the Maastricht treaty, the recessions
negative e¤ect on tax revenues largely o¤set the impact of these scal measures. To restore
competitiveness and stimulate employment, the Parliament reduced employers contributions to
social security, which were funded by the VAT hike. Sources: Grei¤, Peter R. Belgium Is unlikely

France

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 2 (from 18.6% to 20.6%). Date of implementation: August 1, 1995. Endogenous.
An important motive for the 1995 VAT increase was de cit reduction and e¤orts to comply with
Maastricht treaty requirements. However, the VAT increase was put in place partly to pay for a
job creation program and was o¤set by other changes seen as emergency measures to combat a
calamitous economic situation. (Dejevsky, 1995). Sources: Dejevsky, Mary. French pay higher

In 2000, France was in its third straight year of sustained output growth with low ination and
enjoyed a strong scal situation. Low de cits presented an opportunity for France to lower its tax
burden, which was the highest in the Euro region. This tax reduction was motivated by pressure to
lower taxes in the face of scal surpluses. Sources: IMF Public Information Notice No. 00/95. IMF

Germany

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 1 (from 11% to 12%). Date of implementation: July 1, 1983. Endogenous.
Germany experienced recessionary conditions in early 1982. At end-1982 and early 1983 signs of
renewed strengthening of demand were appearing. On the scal front, the scal de cit moved from
approximate balance in 1970 to a de cit of 3.9% of GDP in 1982. Fiscal policy in 1983 combined
consolidation e¤orts, on the one hand, with measures to stimulate private and public investment,
on the other. Measures involved limiting the rise in expenditure for certain social bene ts and VAT
tax increases to reduce the de cit, as well as the reduction in business taxes to increase investment.

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 1 (from 14% to 15%). Date of implementation: January 1, 1993. Date of passage: February 1, 1992. Exogenous.
German reuni cation took place in 1990. Afterwards, the country ran large scal de cits due to
reuni cation costs including income support and developing a market economy in the former East
Germany. The 1993 VAT increase was intended to address the de cits resulting from reuni cation.
The general scal de cit reached 2.8% of GDP in 1992 and was expected to rise above 4 percent
of GDP in 1993. European Union rate harmonization also motivated the increase. Sources:

The resulting increase in social expenditures and declining tax revenue exacerbated the large
budget de cits that followed reuni cation. The economy began to recover in 1997 due to increased
demand for its exports, with real GDP growth reaching 2 14 percent. Economic priorities included
lowering de cits to the 3% level required by the Maastricht treaty. The VAT increased mainly
for this goal. Sources: Kohl Faces tax rises and welfare cuts to meet Euro date. The Times

After several years of slow growth, Germany was experiencing a gradual upswing. Despite
strengthening GDP growth, investment, and employment, Germanys economy struggled due to
high-cost entitlement programs and concerns over de cits, which were above 3% of GDP through
2004 and contributed to rising debt-to-GDP ratios projected at 67.5 percent in 2006. This tax
increase was enacted to lower the scal de cits. Sources: Atkins, Raph. Germanys gamble with

Ireland

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 0.5 (from 21% to 21.5%). Date of implementation: December 1, 2008. Date of passage: October 14, 2008. Exogenous.
Irelands "Celtic Tiger" growth period ended with the onset of the global nancial crisis. Irelands scal imbalance developed during the boom years. Well before the crisis hit, public nances
26

had developed serious structural weaknesses. The facts are well known. In the boom years, personal income tax rates were lowered and expenditure grew rapidly (at about the highest pace
among OECD economies). Buoyant property-related revenues (stamp duties, VAT, and capitalrelated taxes) masked the growing structural de cit, which reached 12 12 percent of GDP in 2008
(IMF, 2009). With the scal de cit about to hit 15% of GDP in 2008, tax increases and spending
cuts, each totaling about 1 percent of GDP, were announced with the 2009 budget. Sources: IMF.

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 1 (from 19% to 20%). Date of implementation: October 1, 1997. Date of passage: September 1, 1997. Exogenous.
After a slowdown of the economy in 1996, economic growth resumed in the second quarter of
1997 as private consumption increased. Italys primary scal goal in 1997 was ensuring entry into
the European Monetary Union as one of the founding members. Italys scal situation had improved
signi cantly from the 1980s, when it su¤ered chronically large budget de cits. The primary balance
rst recorded a surplus in 1991 and the surplus was estimated at 6.7 percent of GDP in 1997.
The debt-to-GDP ratio was still high at 122 percent of GDP but was declining at record rates.
Despite earlier plans to reach the Maastricht de cit criterion of 3% of GDP in 1998, in late 1996
the Italian government decided to increase the pace of scal consolidation with additional revenue
measures such as an increase in VAT. Sources: Blitz, James. Prodi budget aims to avert welfare

Japan

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 2 (from 3% to 5%). Date of implementation: April 1, 1997. Date of passage: June 25, 1996. Exogenous.
Japans asset price bubble collapsed in 1990. Afterwards, GDP growth averaged only 1.5%
annually for eight years as domestic demand stalled. Japan attempted to stimulate the economy
repeatedly during the early 1990s with scal stimulus and monetary policy. As a result of scal
stimulus, central government de cits had increased to 4.2% of GDP by 1996. As a result, the policy
focus shifted toward de cit reduction and a return to a stable scal position. The 1997 budget
aimed at reducing the structural de cit to 2% of GDP. Revenue measures included the increase of
the VAT by 2 percentage points to 5%. Sources: Bartlett, Bruce. Economic miseries of VAT tax

Portugals Stability Program aimed at a balanced structural budget by 2004. The high and
chronic de cits since early 1990s forced the government in 2002 to take several measures (including
an increase in the standard VAT rate) to correct the de cit. Sources: Curbing expenditure is a

Rising private sector indebtedness, low bank capitalization, and declining competitiveness resulted in a slowdown beginning in 2001 and a crippling recession between 2002 and 2004. Despite
expectations of real GDP growth of only 12 percent in 2005 and 1 14 percent in 2006, Portugals
scal strategy focused on lowering the budget de cit, which had risen to 6.1% of GDP. The chief
measures were a VAT rate increase and freeze on public sector wages. The government, reluctant
to cut other spending, defended the increase in the VAT rate from 19 to 21 percent by arguing it
had to raise taxes due to European Community pressure for quick improvement on the de cit front

Spain

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 1 (from 12% to 13%). Date of implementation: January 1, 1992. Date of passage: December 30, 1991. Exogenous.
Spains economic growth decelerated in 1990 and stagnated in 1991 in response to the sluggish
international environment. The scal de cit increased from about 3% in 1989 to 5% in 1991, in large
part due to the e¤ects of automatic stabilizers. In order to adjust scal de cits to the Maastricht
Treaty levels of no greater than 3%, the Spanish authorities reacted to the scal deterioration by
reducing unemployment compensation bene ts and increasing the VAT on two occasions in 1992.

De cits grew from 2.8% to 7.5% of GDP between 1989 and 1993, due to both the recession
and lax expenditures policy. In July 1994, the Spanish government submitted a Convergence Plan
to the European Council that set out targets for de cit reduction. Most of the reduction was to
come from expenditure reduction, including a number of labor market reforms involving limits on
public sector wage increases and reforms to unemployment compensation. Sources: IMF Archives:

Sweden

Change in VAT rate (in percentage-points): 1.95 (from 21.51% to 23.46%). Date of
implementation: January 1, 1983. Endogenous.
In the early 1980s Sweden su¤ered from a twin de cit problem of large current account and
scal de cits. These problems developed after the oil price shocks in the mid-1970s. Rising wages
and loss of competitiveness in key industries, combined with labor market rigidities, and subsidies
for deteriorating industries resulted in slow adjustment. A new government took o¢ce in late 1982
after general elections in September. The government pursued a crisis program aimed at increasing
production and raising full employment (OECD, 1984). The program raised the VAT to 23.46%
28

in 1983 to cover the cost of restoring bene ts cut by the previous government (i.e., countercyclical
action). Sources: Apple, R. W. Jr. Social Democrats favored in Sweden. The New York Times

Computation of tax multiplier and standard error

The derivation
of equation (6) is as follows. First, let us de ne XJ  XJ X0 and XJ 



PJ
j=0 Xj =J where the variable X may be Y , R, I, t. Notice that YJ =RJ = (YJ =YJ )= RJ =YJ .

From equation (4), YJ =YJ = ! J t. Therefore, YJ =RJ = ! J t= RJ =YJ . Since R  I  Y ,
then RJ  YJ  IJ + IJ  YJ . Further, given that e  I=t is taken as a constant and since

tJ = t, then IJ = e  t. Hence, YJ =RJ = ! J t= IJ + IJ  ! J t = ! J = e + IJ  ! J .
In our empirical calculations we proxy IJ with the sample average.
The derivation of equation (7) is as follows.
From (6), T ax multiplier = f (x), where
f (x) = x=(e + x  IJ ): Using a rst-order approximation, we obtain T ax multiplier (J) = f (! J ) +
f 0 (! J ) (x ! J ) = f (! J )+f 0 (! J ) x f 0 (! J ) ! J . Hence, V ar [T ax multiplier (J)] = [f 0 (! J )]2 V ar [x].
Evaluating f (x) at x = ! J , V ar [T ax multiplier (J)] = [f 0 (! J )]2 V ar [! J ]. Hence, T ax multiplierSE
2
SE
(J) = f 0 (! J )  ! SE
J . Using (6), it follows that T ax multiplierSE (J) = [e= e + ! J  IJ ]  ! J .
We now show that for the case of cyclically-adjusted revenues (ca), the corresponding expressions

where  J represents the cumulative e¤ect on the growth rate of output of a one percentage-point

Theproof of the
rst expression is as follows. We start by de ning XJ  XJ X0 and

PJ
XJ 
Notice that YJ =RJ =
j=0 Xj =J where the variable X may be Y , R, I, ca.

(YJ =YJ )= RJ =YJ . From an equation like (4) with
 ca (instead of t) as regressors, YJ =YJ =
 J ca. Therefore, YJ =RJ =  J ca= RJ =YJ . Since R  I  Y , then RJ  YJ  IJ +
IJ  YJ . Therefore, YJ =RJ =  J ca= IJ + IJ  YJ =YJ . From (3) and since caJ = ca
and YJ =YJ =  J ca, IJ =IJ  ca (1 ) YJ =YJ = (1 (1 )  J ) ca. Using the latter
expression, it is easy to show that YJ =RJ =  J = (1 +  J  ) IJ . In our empirical calculations
we proxy IJ with the sample average.
To derive the second expression above, notice that we can write the rst expression as T ax
multiplier (J) = f (x), where f (x) = x=[(1 + x  ) IJ ]. Using a rst order approximation, we
obtain T ax multiplier (J) = f ( J ) + f 0 ( J ) (x  J ) = f ( J ) + f 0 ( J ) x f 0 ( J )  J . Hence,
V ar [T ax multiplier (J)] = [f 0 ( J )]2 V ar [x]. Evaluating f (x) at x =  J , then V ar [T ax multiplier (J)] =
[f 0 ( J n

Finally, T ax multiplierSE

Belgium

Jan. 1, 1983

2
(17% to 19%)

Exogenous. Fiscal deficit rose from 12% of GDP in 1980 to 16% of GDP in 1981.
Public debt reached 127% of GDP in 1982.

Oct. 10, 1983

Belgium

April 1, 1992

0.5
(19% to 19.5%)

Exogenous. Belgium’s general government deficit peaked at over 16% of GNP in
1981. As a result, fiscal policy for the rest of the decade first focused on stabilizing
and then reducing the public debt ratio.

March 1, 1992

Belgium

Jan. 1, 1994

1
(19.5% to 20.5%)

Endogenous. A reduction in employers’ contributions to social security to restore
competitiveness and stimulate employment was funded by a VAT hike.

Belgium

Jan. 1, 1996

0.5
(20.5% to 21%)

Exogenous. The VAT increase was part of a medium-term fiscal plan to reduce the
deficit to the Maastricht limit of 3% of GDP.

France

Aug. 1, 1995

2
(18.6% to 20.6%)

Endogenous. The VAT increase was put in place partly to pay for a job creation
program and was offset by other changes “seen as emergency measures to combat a
“calamitous” economic situation.” (Dejevsky, 1995).

France

April 1, 2000

-1
(20.6% to 19.6%)

Endogenous. The VAT reduction was motivated by pressure to lower taxes in the face
of fiscal surpluses in the context of a booming economy.

Germany

July 1, 1983

1
(11% to 12%)

Endogenous. Fiscal policy in 1983 was a combination of consolidation efforts and
measures to stimulate the economy.

Germany

Jan. 1, 1993

1
(14% to 15%)

Exogenous. The 1993 VAT increase was intended to address the deficit resulting from
the 1990 reunification.

Feb. 1, 1992

Germany

April 1, 1998

1
(15% to 16%)

Exogenous. Increasing social expenditure and declining tax revenue exacerbated the
large budget deficits run following reunification (which were above the Maastricht
treaty). The VAT was increased to address this situation.

Dec. 1, 1997

Germany

Jan. 1, 2007

3
(16% to 19%)

Exogenous. High-cost entitlement programs contributed to rising debt-to-GDP ratio,
projected at 67.5% in 2006. The increase in VAT was meant to improve the fiscal
situation.

June 16, 2006

Ireland

Dec. 1, 2008

0.5
(21% to 21.5%)

Exogenous. “Well before the crisis hit, public finances had developed serious
structural weaknesses” (IMF, 2009). With the fiscal deficit projected to reach 15% of
GDP in 2008, the government increased taxes and cut spending.

Oct. 14, 2008

Italy

Oct. 1, 1997

1
(19% to 20%)

Sept. 1, 1997

Japan

April 1, 1997

2
(3% to 5%)

Exogenous. To ensure entry into the EMU -- and with the fiscal deficit for 1997
projected at 6.7% of GDP and the debt-ratio still at 122% of GDP -- the Italian
government decided to increase the pace of fiscal consolidation with additional
revenue measures such as an increase in VAT.
Exogenous. As a result of fiscal stimulus in the early 1990s, the government deficit
had increased to 4.2% of GDP by 1996. In 1997, policy shifted toward deficit
reduction and returning to a stable fiscal position, which included an increase in the
VAT.

Portugal

June 5, 2002

2
(17% to 19%)

Exogenous. Portugal’s Stability Program carried a commitment to a balanced
structural budget by 2004. The high and chronic fiscal deficits since the early 1990s
forced the government to take several measures to correct the deficit in 2002.

May 5, 2002

Portugal

July 1, 2005

2
(19% to 21%)

Exogenous. “The government, reluctant to cut other spending, defended the increase
in the VAT rate from 19% to 21% by arguing it had to raise taxes due to European
Community pressure for quick improvement on the deficit front” (Frasquilho, 2005).

June 1, 2005

Spain

Jan. 1, 1992

1
(12% to 13%)

Exogenous. In order to adjust fiscal deficits to Maastricht Treaty levels, the Spanish
authorities reacted to the fiscal deterioration of 1990 and 1991 by reducing
unemployment compensation benefits and increasing the VAT on two occasions in
1992.

Dec. 30, 1991

Spain

Aug. 1, 1992

2
(13% to 15%)

Spain

Jan. 1, 1995

1
(15% to 16%)

Exogenous. Deficits increased from 2.8% to 7.5% of GDP between 1989 and 1993
due to the recession of the early 1990s and a lax expenditures policy. In 1994 the
Spanish government introduced several fiscal reforms to reduce the deficit.

Sweden

Jan. 1, 1983

1.95
(21.51% to
23.46%)

Endogenous. The new government that took office in 1982 pursued a program aimed
at increasing production and raising full employment (OECD, 1984). As part of this
program, the VAT was increased to 23.46% in 1983 to cover the cost of restoring
benefits cut by the previous government.

Note: See Appendix 6.3 for full tax narratives.

Exogenous. Same rationale as previous case.
