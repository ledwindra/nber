In turn, this real rigidity makes the economy prone to involuntary unemployment  during external crises. This paper presents a graphical analysis of alternative policy strategies aimed at mitigating this source of inefficiency.  First- and second-best monetary and fiscal solutions are analyzed.  Second-best solutions are found to be prudential, whereas first-best solutions  are not.\n\n",
