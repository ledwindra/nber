    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper estimates causal intergenerational occupation transmission in the military using discontinuities in parents\u2019 eligibility for service from the Armed Forces Qualification Test. A parent\u2019s enlistment in the Army increases their children\u2019s military service propensity by between 58% and 110%. Intergenerational occupational transmission rates vary by race and sex\u2014they are highest for demographic groups whose parents gained the most economically from service and for same-sex parent-child pairs. Our findings provide new evidence on the mechanisms driving intergenerational occupation correlations and indicate increasing access to good occupations is an important channel for improving intergenerational economic mobility for less advantaged groups.\n\n",
