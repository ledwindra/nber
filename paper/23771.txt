Strategy-proofness in the Large

JEL No. C72,C78,D44,D47,D82
ABSTRACT
We propose a criterion of approximate incentive compatibility, strategy-proofness in the large
(SP-L), and argue that it is a useful second-best to exact strategy-proofness (SP) for market
design. Conceptually, SP-L requires that an agent who regards a mechanism’s “prices” as
exogenous to her report – be they traditional prices as in an auction mechanism, or price-like
statistics in an assignment or matching mechanism – has a dominant strategy to report truthfully.
Mathematically, SP-L weakens SP in two ways: (i) truth-telling is required to be approximately
optimal (within epsilon in a large enough market) rather than exactly optimal, and (ii) incentive
compatibility is evaluated ex interim, with respect to all full-support i.i.d. probability distributions
of play, rather than ex post with respect to all possible realizations of play. This places SP-L in
between the traditional notion of approximate strategy-proofness, which evaluates incentives to
manipulate ex post, and the traditional notion of approximate Bayes-Nash incentive
compatibility, which evaluates incentives to manipulate ex interim with respect to the single
common-knowledge probability distribution associated with Bayes-Nash equilibrium.

Introduction

Strategy-proofness (SP), that playing the game truthfully is a dominant strategy, is perhaps
the central notion of incentive compatibility in market design. SP is frequently imposed as
a design requirement in theoretical analyses, across a broad range of assignment, auction,
and matching problems. And, SP has played a central role in several design reforms in practice, including the redesign of school choice mechanisms in several cities, the redesign of the
market that matches medical school graduates to residency positions, and efforts to create
mechanisms for pairwise kidney exchange (See especially Roth (2008) and Pathak and Sönmez (2008, 2013)). There are several reasons why SP is considered so attractive. First, SP
mechanisms are robust: since reporting truthfully is a dominant strategy, equilibrium does
not depend on market participants’ beliefs about other participants’ preferences or information. Second, SP mechanisms are strategically simple: market participants do not have to
invest time and effort collecting information about others’ preferences or about what equilibrium will be played. Third, with this simplicity comes a measure of fairness: a participant
who lacks the information or sophistication to game the mechanism is not disadvantaged
relative to sophisticated participants. Fourth, SP mechanisms generate information about
true preferences that may be useful to policy makers.1
However, SP is restrictive. In a variety of market design contexts, including matching,
school choice, course allocation, and combinatorial auctions, impossibility theorems show
that SP places meaningful limitations on what other attractive properties a mechanism can
hope to satisfy.2 And, SP is an extremely strong requirement. If there is a single configuration
of participants’ preferences in which a single participant has a strategic misreport that raises
his utility by epsilon, a mechanism is not SP. A natural idea is to look for incentives criteria
that are less demanding and less restrictive than SP, while still maintaining some of the

et al. (2006) on fairness, and Roth (2008) and Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2016)on the advantage of generating
preference data.

In matching problems such as the National Resident Matching Program, SP mechanisms are not stable
(Roth, 1982). In multi-unit assignment problems such as course allocation, the only SP and ex-post efficient
mechanisms are dictatorships (Papai, 2001; Ehlers and Klaus, 2003; Hatfield, 2009), which perform poorly on
measures of fairness and ex-ante welfare (Budish and Cantillon, 2012). In school choice problems, which can
be interpreted as a hybrid of an assignment and a matching problem (Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez, 2003),
there is no mechanism that is both SP and ex-post efficient (Abdulkadiroğlu et al., 2009). In combinatorial
auction problems such as the FCC spectrum auctions (Milgrom, 2004; Cramton et al., 2006), the only SP
and efficient mechanism is Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (Green and Laffont, 1977; Holmström, 1979), which has
a variety of important drawbacks (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2006). Perhaps the earliest such negative result
for SP mechanisms is Hurwicz (1972), which shows that SP is incompatible with implementing a Walrasian
equilibrium in an exchange economy.

advantages of SP design.
This paper proposes a criterion of approximate strategy-proofness called strategy-proofness
in the large (SP-L). SP-L weakens SP in two ways. First, whereas SP requires that truthful
reporting is optimal in any size economy, SP-L requires that truthful reporting is approximately optimal in a large enough market (within epsilon for large enough n). Second, whereas
SP requires that truthful reporting is optimal against any realization of opponent reports,
SP-L requires that truthful reporting is optimal only against any full-support, independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) probability distribution of reports. That is, SP-L examines incentives from the interim perspective rather than ex-post. Because of this interim
perspective, SP-L is weaker than the traditional ex-post notion of approximate strategyproofness; this weakening is important both conceptually and for our results. At the same
time, SP-L is importantly stronger than approximate Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility,
because SP-L requires that truthful reporting is best against any full-support, i.i.d. probability distribution of opponent reports, not just the single probability distribution associated
with Bayes-Nash equilibrium play. This strengthening is important because it allows SP-L
to approximate, in large markets, the attractive properties such as robustness and strategic
simplicity which are the reason why market designers like SP better than Bayes-Nash in the
first place.
This combination of approximate incentives in a large market and the interim perspective
is powerful for the following reason: it causes each participant to regard the societal distribution of play as exogenous to his own report (more precisely, the distribution of the societal
distribution of play). As will become clear, regarding the societal distribution of play as
exogenous to one’s own play is a generalization of the idea of regarding prices as exogenous,
i.e., of price taking. In some settings, such as multi-unit auctions or Walrasian exchange, the
two concepts are equivalent. In other settings, such as school choice or two-sided matching,
regarding the societal distribution of play as exogenous is equivalent to regarding certain
price-like summary statistics of the mechanism as exogenous.
SP-L thus draws a distinction between two ways a mechanism can fail to be SP. If
a mechanism is manipulable by participants who can affect prices (or price-like summary
statistics), but is not manipulable by participants who regard the societal distribution of play
as exogenous, the mechanism is SP-L. If a mechanism is manipulable even by participants
who regard the societal distribution of play as exogenous – if even a price taker, or a taker of
price-like statistics, wishes to misreport – then the mechanism, in addition to not being SP, is
not SP-L. Intuition suggests that these latter violations of SP are especially problematic for

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

practice, because, to manipulate a mechanism, a participant only needs information about
aggregate statistics, such as how popular is each school in a school matching mechanism. This
is problematic because there are many real-world environments where participants have this
kind of information. SP-L rules out mechanisms that violate SP in this particularly serious
way.
After we present and discuss the formal definition of SP-L, the next part of the paper provides a classification of existing non-SP mechanisms into those that are SP-L and
those that are not SP-L. The classification, displayed in Table 1, organizes both the prior
theory literature on which non-SP mechanisms have good incentives properties in large markets and the empirical record on when non-SP matters in real-world large markets. In the
SP-L column are numerous mechanisms that, while not SP, have been shown theoretically
to have approximate incentives for truth telling in large markets. Examples include the
Walrasian mechanism (Roberts and Postlewaite, 1976; Jackson and Manelli, 1997), double auctions (Rustichini et al., 1994; Cripps and Swinkels, 2006), multi-unit uniform-price
auctions (Swinkels, 2001), the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm (Immorlica and
Mahdian, 2005; Kojima and Pathak, 2009), and probabilistic serial (Kojima and Manea,
2010). This literature has used a wide variety of definitions of approximate incentive compatibility, as well as a wide variety of analysis techniques. We use a single definition and
a single analysis technique (the sufficient conditions for SP-L in Theorem 1) and find that
all of these mechanisms are SP-L.3 Our technique also classifies as SP-L several mechanisms
whose large-market incentive properties had not previously been formally studied.
On the other hand, in the non-SP-L column are numerous mechanisms for which there is
explicit empirical evidence that real-world market participants strategically misreport their
preferences, to the detriment of design objectives such as efficiency or fairness. Examples
include multi-unit pay-as-bid auctions (Friedman, 1960, 1991), the Boston mechanism for
school choice (Abdulkadiroğlu et al., 2006, 2009), the bidding points auction for course
allocation (Sönmez and Ünver, 2010; Budish, 2011), the draft mechanism for course allocation
(Budish and Cantillon, 2012), and the priority-match mechanism for two-sided matching
(Roth, 2002). This literature has frequently emphasized that the mechanism in question is
not SP; our point is that the mechanisms for which there is documentation of important
incentives problems in practice not only are not SP, but are not even SP-L. Overall, the
3

Note as well that the traditional ex-post notion of approximate strategy-proofness is too strong to obtain
the classification. For instance, the uniform-price auction is SP-L but is not approximately strategy-proof
in an ex-post sense; even in a large economy it is always possible to construct a knife-edge situation where a
single player, by shading her demand, can have a large discontinuous influence on the market-clearing price.

classification exercise suggests that the relevant distinction for practice, in markets with a
large number of participants, is not “SP vs. not SP”, but rather “SP-L vs. not SP-L”.
The last part of the paper identifies a precise sense in which, in large markets, SP-L is
approximately costless to impose relative to Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility. Formally,
we consider social choice functions that take as input both agents’ preferences and their
beliefs, and that can be implemented by the (limit) Bayes-Nash equilibria of a mechanism,
considering agents’ beliefs that can be any full-support i.i.d. common prior over payoff types.
For example, consider the Boston mechanism for school choice. Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2011)
show, given an arbitrarily set full-support i.i.d. common prior, that the Boston mechanism
has a Bayes-Nash equilibrium that yields an ex-ante efficient allocation. This map from
preferences and beliefs to equilibrium outcomes is a social choice function that fits our assumptions. Theorem 2 shows, given such a Bayes-Nash implementable social choice function,
that there exists an SP-L mechanism that achieves approximately the same outcomes. Thus,
while SP is often costly to impose relative to Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility, there is a
precise sense in which SP-L is no more restrictive than Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility.
Overall, our analysis suggests that in large market settings SP-L approximates the advantages of SP design while being significantly less restrictive. Our hope is that market
designers will view SP-L as a practical alternative to SP in settings with a meaningful num-

ber of participants and in which SP mechanisms perform poorly. An illustration of this
approach is the SP-L course allocation mechanism recently implemented at the Wharton
School, replacing a mechanism that was manipulable in the large, in an environment with
numerous impossibility theorems for SP.4
We emphasize that the idea that market size can ease incentive problems is quite old,
with some of the earliest contributions being Roberts and Postlewaite (1976) and Hammond
(1979), and rich and active literatures in both implementation theory and market design
since these early contributions. We discuss the relevant literatures in detail in the body
of the paper. Our paper makes three substantive contributions relative to this literature.
First, the criterion of SP-L itself is new. There are many other criteria of approximate
incentive compatibility in the literature (see footnote 15). SP-L is perhaps closest to the
two criteria it lands in between: the traditional notion of approximate SP (which evaluates
incentives to manipulate from the ex-post perspective) and the traditional notion of approximate Bayes-Nash (which evaluates incentives to manipulate from the interim perspective,
like SP-L, but with respect only to the single probability distribution associated with equilibrium play). Second, our classification of mechanisms, into those that are SP-L and those
that are manipulable even in large markets, is new. We expect few market design researchers
will find the classification surprising ex-post; for example, Kojima and Pathak (2009) noted
that the Boston mechanism fails their approximate IC criterion (roughly, that truth-telling
is approximate Bayes-Nash), and Friedman (1991) informally discusses the incentives difference between pay-as-bid and uniform-price auctions. Rather, our contribution is to produce
a classification of mechanisms across all of the canonical market design problems using a
single criterion and analytical approach, which is both useful per se and speaks to the applicability of the criterion and analytical methods. Third, the result that SP-L is approximately
costless relative to Bayes-Nash is new, and is the first such result, to our knowledge, for any
form of approximate strategy-proofness relative to Bayes-Nash; though there are some more
restricted settings where SP itself is costless relative to Bayes-Nash (Manelli and Vincent,
2010; Gershkov et al., 2011).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the environment. Section
4

For further details see Budish et al. (2015) and Budish and Kessler (2016). Notably, while the Wharton
administration was concerned about how easy the old mechanism was to manipulate, they were not concerned
about the fact that the new mechanism is SP-L but not SP. An excerpt from the student training manual
highlights this point: “Doesn’t it pay to think strategically? NO! You cannot influence the clearing price
(you are only one of 1600 students). So your best ‘strategy’ is to assume the clearing prices are given. And
to tell Course Match [the mechanism] your true preferences so that it can buy you your best schedule, given
your preferences, your budget and the given clearing prices.” (Wharton, 2013)

Bayes-Nash. Section 6 applies the theorem to the Boston mechanism. Section 7 discusses
technical extensions. Section 8 discusses related literature. Section 9 concludes. Proofs and
other supporting materials are in the appendix.

Environment

We work with an abstract mechanism design environment in which mechanisms assign outcomes to agents based on the set of agents’ reports. There is a finite set of payoff types T
and a finite set of outcomes (or consumption bundles) X0 . The outcome space describes
the outcome possibilities for an individual agent. For example, in an auction the elements
in X0 specify both the objects an agent receives and the payment she makes. In school
assignment, X0 is the set of schools to which a student can be assigned. An agent’s payoff
type determines her preferences over outcomes. For each ti ∈ T there is a von NeumannMorgenstern expected utility function uti : X → [0, 1], where X = ∆X0 denotes the set
of lotteries over outcomes. Preferences are private values in the sense that an agent’s utility
depends exclusively on her payoff type and the outcome she receives.
We study mechanisms that are well defined for all possible market sizes, holding fixed
X0 and T . For each market size n ∈ N, where n denotes the number of agents, an allocation
is a vector of n outcomes, one for each agent, and there is a set Yn ⊆ (X0 )n of feasible
allocations. For instance, in an auction, the assumption that X0 is fixed imposes that
the number of potential types of objects is finite, and the sequence (Yn )N describes how the
supply of each type of object changes as the market grows.
Definition 1. Fix a set of outcomes X0 , a set of payoff types T , and a sequence of feasibility
constraints (Yn )N . A mechanism {(Φn )N , A} consists of a finite set of actions A and a
sequence of allocation functions
Φn : An → ∆((X0 )n ),

(2.1)

each of which satisfies feasibility: for any n ∈ N and a ∈ An , the support of Φn (a) is contained
in the feasible set Yn . A mechanism is direct if A = T .
We assume that mechanisms are anonymous, which requires that each agent’s outcome
depends only on her own action and the distribution of all actions. Formally, a mechanism

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

7

is anonymous if the allocation function Φn (·) is invariant to permutations for all n ∈ N.
Anonymity is a natural feature of many large-market settings. In Supplementary Appendix
B we relax anonymity to semi-anonymity (Kalai, 2004). A mechanism is semi-anonymous
if agents are divided into a finite set of groups, and an agent’s outcome depends only on her
own action, her group, and the distribution of actions within each group. Semi-anonymity
accommodates applications in which there are asymmetries among classes of participants,
such as double auctions in which there are distinct buyers and sellers and school choice
problems in which students are grouped into different priority classes, as well as some models
of matching markets.
We adopt the following notation. Given a finite set S, the set of probability distributions
¯
over S is denoted ∆S, and the set of distributions with full support ∆S.
Distributions over
the set of payoff types will typically be denoted as µ ∈ ∆T , and distributions over actions
by m ∈ ∆A. Throughout the analysis we will use the supremum norm on the sets ∆T ,
∆A and X. Since the number of payoff types, actions and outcomes is finite, all of these
probability spaces are subsets of Euclidean space. Using this representation, we denote the
distance between two outcomes x, x0 ∈ X as kx − x0 k, and likewise for distributions over T
and A. In particular, we use this topology in the definition of limit mechanisms below.
Given a vector of payoff types t ∈ T n , we use the notation emp[t] to denote the empirical
distribution of t on T . That is, for each payoff type τ ∈ T , emp[t](τ ) is the fraction of
coordinates of t that equal τ , and the vector emp[t] = (emp[t](τ ))τ ∈T . Analogously, given a
vector of actions a ∈ An , emp[a] denotes the empirical distribution of a on A.

Strategy-proof in the Large

In this section we formally define strategy-proofness in the large (SP-L) and discuss its
interpretation and its relationship to previous concepts.

3.1

The Large Market

We begin by defining our notion of the large market. Given a mechanism {(Φn )N , A}, define,
for each n, the function φn : A × ∆A → X according to
φn (ai , m) =

X
a−i ∈An−1

Φni (ai , a−i ) · Pr(a−i |a−i ∼ iid(m)),

(3.1)

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

8

where Φni (ai , a−i ) denotes the marginal distribution of the ith coordinate of Φn (a), i.e., the
lottery over outcomes received by agent i when she plays ai and the other n − 1 agents play
a−i , and Pr(a−i |a−i ∼ iid(m)) denotes the probability that the action vector a−i is realized
given n−1 independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws from the action distribution
m ∈ ∆A. In words, φn (ai , m) describes what an agent who plays ai expects to receive, ex
interim, if the other n − 1 agents play i.i.d. according to action distribution m.
We use the interim allocation function φn to define the large-market limit.
Definition 2. The large-market limit of mechanism {(Φn )N , A} is the function φ∞ :
A × ∆A → X given by
φ∞ (ai , m) = lim φn (ai , m),
n→∞

if this limit exists.
In words, φ∞ (ai , m) equals the lottery that an agent who plays ai receives, in the limit
as the number of agents grows large, when the other agents play i.i.d. according to the
probability distribution m.5
It is easy to construct examples of mechanisms that do not have limits. For instance, if a
mechanism is a uniform-price auction when n is even and is a pay-as-bid auction when n is
odd, then the mechanism does not have a limit. The main results in this paper, Theorems
1 and 2, are valid regardless of the existence of the limit. Nevertheless, the limit is useful to
understand the definition of SP-L, and is useful in the analysis of specific mechanisms.
The Role of Randomness in the Large Market The randomness in how we let the
market grow large is important for the following reason: from the interim perspective, as the
market grows large in our way, the distribution of the empirical distribution of play becomes
exogenous to any particular agent’s own play. We state this claim formally in the Appendix
as Lemma A.1. Intuitively, if a fair coin is tossed n times the distribution of the number of
heads is stochastic, and the influence of the ith coin toss on this distribution vanishes to zero
as n → ∞; whereas if the market grew large in a deterministic fashion one player’s decision
between heads or tails could be pivotal as to whether the number of heads is greater than
or less than 50%.
We interpret treating the societal distribution of play as exogenous to one’s own report
as a generalized version of price taking. Suppose that a mechanism has prices that are a
5

The randomness in how we take the large-market limit is in contrast with early approaches to largemarket analysis, such as Debreu and Scarf’s (1963) replicator economy and Aumann’s (1966) continuum
economy. It is more closely related to the random economy method used in Immorlica and Mahdian’s (2005)
and Kojima and Pathak’s (2009) studies of large matching markets.

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

function of the empirical distribution of play. For example, in a uniform-price auction, price
is determined based on where reported demand equals reported supply. In our large market,
because the distribution of the empirical distribution of play is exogenous to each agent, the
distribution of prices is exogenous to each agent. Now suppose that a mechanism does not
have prices, but has price-like statistics that are functions of the empirical distribution of
play and sufficient statistics for the outcomes received by agents who played each action.
For example, in Bogomolnaia and Moulin’s (2001) assignment mechanism, the empirical
distribution of reports determines statistics called “run-out times”, which describe at what
time in their algorithm each object exhausts its capacity. In our large market, each agent
regards the distribution of these price-like statistics as exogenous to their own report.

3.2

Definition of SP-L

A mechanism is strategy-proof (SP) if it is optimal for each agent to report truthfully, in
any size market, given any realization of opponent reports.
Definition 3. The direct mechanism {(Φn )N , T } is strategy-proof (SP) if, for all n, all
ti , t0i ∈ T , and all t−i ∈ T n−1
uti [Φni (ti , t−i )] ≥ uti [Φni (t0i , t−i )].
We say that a mechanism is strategy-proof in the large (SP-L) if, for any full-support
i.i.d. distribution of opponent reports, reporting truthfully is approximately optimal in large
markets. For mechanisms that have a limit, this is equivalent to, for any full-support i.i.d.
distribution of opponent reports, reporting truthfully being optimal in the limit.
Definition 4. The direct mechanism {(Φn )N , T } is strategy-proof in the large (SP-L)
¯ and  > 0 there exists n0 such that, for all n ≥ n0 and all ti , t0i ∈ T ,
if, for any m ∈ ∆T
uti [φn (ti , m)] ≥ uti [φn (t0i , m)] − .
¯ and all ti , t0 ∈ T ,
If the mechanism has a limit, this is equivalent to, for any m ∈ ∆T
i
uti [φ∞ (ti , m)] ≥ uti [φ∞ (t0i , m)].
Otherwise, the mechanism is manipulable in the large.

SP-L weakens SP in two ways. First, while SP requires that truthful reporting is optimal
in any size market, SP-L requires that truthful reporting is only approximately optimal
in a large enough market. Second, SP evaluates what report is best based on the (expost) realization of reports, whereas SP-L evaluates based on the (ex-interim) probability
distribution of reports. A mechanism can be SP-L even if it has the property that, given
 > 0, in any size market n one can find a payoff type ti and realization of opponent reports
t−i for which ti has a misreport worth more than . What SP-L rules out is that there is a
full-support i.i.d. probability distribution of opponent reports with this property. Implicitly,
SP-L takes a view on what information participants have in a large market when they decide
how to play – they may have a (possibly incorrect) sense of the distribution of opponent
preferences, but they do not know the exact realization of opponent preferences.
These two weakenings place SP-L between two commonly used notions of incentive compatibility. SP-L is weaker than the standard ex-post notion of asymptotic strategy-proofness,
which requires that reporting truthfully is approximately optimal, in a large enough market,
for any realization of opponent reports.6 This distinction is important for the classification
below; nearly all of the mechanisms that are classified as SP-L would fail this stronger criterion (e.g., uniform-price auctions, deferred acceptance), with the lone exception being the
probabilistic serial mechanism. At the same time, SP-L is stronger than approximate BayesNash incentive compatibility, which requires that truthful reporting is approximately optimal
against the true probability distribution of opponent reports, which itself is assumed to be
common knowledge. In contrast, SP-L requires truthful reporting to be approximately optimal for any full-support i.i.d. probability distribution of opponent reports. This distinction
is what allows SP-L mechanisms to maintain, at least approximately, some of the attractive
features of SP design such as robustness, strategic simplicity, and fairness to unsophisticated
agents (cf. Section 7.3).
Finally, the definition of the limit gives a useful way to think about SP-L as a generalization of price-taking. As discussed above, in our large market limit agents regard the
distribution of the aggregate distribution of play as exogenous to their report. A mechanism
fails to be SP-L if even an agent who regards the aggregate distribution of play as exogenous
may wish to misreport. In the case of mechanisms with prices that are a function of the
6

For example, Liu and Pycia (2011) define a mechanism as asymptotically strategy-proof if, given  > 0,
there exists n0 such that for all n ≥ n0 , types ti , t0i , and a vector of n − 1 types t−i ,
uti [Φni (ti , t−i )] ≥ uti [Φni (t0i , t−i )] − .
A similar definition is in Hatfield, Kojima and Kominers (2015).

distribution of play, a mechanism fails to be SP-L if even an agent who regards prices as
exogenous wishes to misreport.

3.3

Clarifying Example: Multi-Unit Auctions

We illustrate several of the key definitions of this section using the example of multi-unit
auctions for identical objects, such as government bond auctions. The two most common
multi-unit auction formats are uniform-price auctions and pay-as-bid auctions. While neither
mechanism is SP (Ausubel and Cramton, 2002), Milton Friedman famously argued in favor
of the uniform-price auction on incentives grounds (Friedman, 1960, 1991). We will see
that the uniform-price auction is SP-L whereas the pay-as-bid auction is manipulable in
the large. The example also illustrates the definition of the large-market limit, the role
of the full-support requirement, and the contrast between SP-L and the traditional notion
of approximate strategy-proofness based on ex-post realizations of others’ play rather than
interim distributions of others’ play. The example is not needed for the remainder of the
analysis, so some readers may prefer to skip it.
Example 1. (Multi-Unit Auctions). There are kn units of a homogeneous good. To
simplify notation, we assume that agents assign a constant per-unit value to the good, up to
a capacity limit. Specifically, each agent i’s type ti = (vi , qi ) consists of a per-unit value vi
and a maximum capacity qi . The set of possible values is V = {1, . . . , v̄}, the set of possible
capacity limits is Q = {0, 1, . . . , q̄} with 1 < k < q̄, and T = V × Q. The set of outcomes
is X0 = ({1, 2, · · · , v̄} × {1, 2, · · · , q̄}) ∪ {0}, with an outcome consisting either of a per-unit
payment and an allotted quantity, or 0 to denote that the agent receives no units and makes
no payment.
We first describe the uniform-price auction. Bids consist of a per-unit value and a maximum capacity, so the action set A = T . Given a vector of n bidders’ reports t, denote the
P
demand for the object at a price of p as D(p; t) = ni=1 qi · 1{vi ≥ p}, where 1{·} is the
indicator function. The market-clearing price p∗ (t) is the highest price at which demand
exceeds supply. That is,

if D(1, t) ≥ k and p∗ (t) = 0 otherwise. The uniform-price auction allocates each bidder i
her demanded quantity at p∗ (t), with the exception that bids with vi = p∗ (t) are rationed
with equal probability. Formally, Φni (t) allots each bidder the following number of units of

at a price per unit of p∗ (t), and the rationing probability r̄ set so that the market clears.7
We now analyze the large-market limit of the uniform-price auction. Let ρ∗ (m) denote
the price that clears supply and average demand given bid distribution m. That is,
ρ∗ (m) = max{p ∈ V : E[D(p; ti )|ti ∼ m] ≥ k}

(3.4)

if E[D(1; ti )|ti ∼ m] ≥ k and 0 otherwise.
Generically, expected demand at price ρ∗ (m) strictly exceeds supply, that is,
E[D(ρ∗ (m); ti )|ti ∼ m] > k.
In this generic case, as the market grows large, the realized price as defined in (3.3) will be
equal to ρ∗ (m) with probability converging to one. Therefore, the limit mechanism allocates
each bidder their demand at ρ∗ (m), again with the exception that bidders with value exactly
equal to ρ∗ (m) are rationed, and with all winning bidders paying ρ∗ (m) per unit. Formally,
φ∞ (ti , m) gives player i

at a per unit price of ρ∗ (m), and the rationing probability r̄ is set so that the market clears
on average.8 Note that, in this generic case, the price in the limit is deterministic and is
7

Since preferences are linear up to the capacity limit, the exact form of the rationing is immaterial in the
analysis below. The rationing constant is
r̄ =

D(p∗ (t); t) − D(p∗ (t) + 1; t)

exogenous from the perspective of each individual bidder.
In addition to the generic case, there is a knife-edge case in which expected demand at
ρ∗ (m) is exactly equal to supply. That is, E[D(ρ∗ (m); ti )|ti ∼ m] = k and ρ∗ (m) > 0. In
this case, focusing for now on m with full support, the price is stochastic even in the largemarket limit. Given large n, the realized per-capita demand at price ρ∗ (m) will be weakly
greater than per-capita supply k with probability of about 21 , and will be strictly smaller
than per-capita supply k with probability of about 12 .9 Therefore, the price in the limit will
be ρ∗ (m) with probability of 12 , and ρ∗ (m) − 1 with probability of 21 . φ∞ (ti , m) assigns to
player i the following expected number of units,
Reported Value Expected Number of Units
vi < ρ∗ (m)

vi ≥ ρ∗ (m)

qi

and prices are ρ∗ (m) or ρ∗ (m) − 1 with equal probability. Note that bids of ρ∗ (m) are not
rationed in the limit. This is so because, in this knife-edge case, average demand is exactly
equal to average supply. Moreover, in both cases the price in the limit is exogenous from
the perspective of each individual bidder. Even though the price is sometimes ρ∗ (m) and
sometimes ρ∗ (m) − 1, the probability that bidder i is pivotal in determining which of the
two prices occurs converges to zero.
The argument that the uniform-price auction is SP-L is now straightforward. Choose
¯ . The description of φ∞ above implies
any type ti and any full support distribution m ∈ ∆T
that truthful reporting is a dominant strategy in the limit, hence Definition 4 is satisfied.
Last, we turn to the pay-as-bid auction. The pay-as-bid auction allocates units of the
good in exactly the same way as the uniform-price auction. The difference is that winning
bidders pay their bid instead of the market-clearing price p∗ (t). Clearly, bidders will gain
from misreporting their value, even in the large-market limit. If the distribution of opponent
bids is m and the limit price is ρ∗ (m), then a bidder of type ti = (vi , qi ) with vi > ρ∗ (m) + 1
strictly prefers to misreport as t0i = (ρ∗ (m) + 1, qi ): he receives the same allocation in the
limit but pays a strictly lower price per unit. Hence, the pay-as-bid auction is not SP-L.

9

The intuition is that if a fair coin is tossed n → ∞ times, the probability that at least n/2 of the tosses
are heads converges to 1/2, just as the probability that less than n/2 of the tosses are heads converges to
1/2, with both probabilities independent of the outcome of the ith toss.

Discussion: SP-L vs. Traditional Approximate SP Observe that the argument that
the uniform price auction is SP-L would not go through using a stronger notion of asymptotic strategy-proofness based on realizations of opponents’ reports rather than probability
distributions. To see this, consider the case where there are k = 2 objects per bidder, and
bidder i knows that all other bidders will report a demand of 2 objects for $100. That is,
that all other bidders report a type of (2, $100) for sure. Then bidder i knows that she is
marginal, and can reduce the market-clearing price to 0 by asking for 1 object instead of 2.
This example illustrates the importance of the interim perspective in the definition of SP-L,
and why SP-L classifies mechanisms in a substantially different way than the traditional
ex-post notion of approximate strategy-proofness.
Discussion: Full Support Requirement The uniform-price auction example also illustrates the importance of the full-support requirement in the SP-L definition. If a bidder believes that opponent reports equal (2, $100) for sure, then she could lower the market-clearing
price from $100 to $0 by demanding a single unit. While this example uses a degenerate
distribution with support on a single type, there are non-degenerate distributions where a
bidder can manipulate the uniform-price auction.10 For example, if bidder i believes that
opponents report (2, $100) or (2, $200) with equal probability, then she can still, with high
probability, drive the prices down from $100 to $0 by asking for one unit instead of two.
Even though she is uncertain about other players’ types, this uncertainty is at a part of the
demand curve that is not relevant for the determination of the market-clearing price. That
said, such manipulations do not seem very realistic because they require extremely detailed
information about opponent play. The full support requirement in the SP-L definition is a
simple way to capture the idea that agents are not likely to have that level of information.
The uniform-price auction example also suggests that, on a case by case basis, it may not
always be necessary to assume full support. As long as there is uncertainty about opponents’
play in a region that is relevant for price determination, bidding truthfully will be optimal
in a large enough market. For example, assume that bidder i believes that her opponents
report (4, $100) or (4, $25) with 50% chance each. Then, in the limit, the market-clearing
price is $100 or $25 with 50% chance each, and bidder i cannot meaningfully affect the price.
Thus, even in this adversarial case where supply intersects the expected demand curve at
a discontinuity, and bidder i thinks that the distribution of opponents’ reports has only
two elements in its support, reporting truthfully is approximately optimal from the interim

pivotal with probability one even in very large markets.

Classification of Non-SP Mechanisms

This section classifies a number of non-SP mechanisms into SP-L and manipulable in the large
(Table 1 in the Introduction), and discusses how the classification organizes the evidence on
manipulability in large markets. Specifically, all of the known mechanisms for which there
is a detailed theoretical case that the mechanism has approximate incentives for truthtelling
in large markets are SP-L (Section 4.2), and all of the known mechanisms for which there is
empirical evidence that non-strategy-proofness causes serious problems even in large markets
are manipulable in the large (Section 4.3). In particular, the classification of mechanisms
based on whether or not they are SP-L predicts whether misreporting is a serious problem
in practice better than the classification of mechanisms based on whether or not they are
SP. These results suggest that, in large markets, SP-L versus not SP-L is a more relevant
relevant dividing line than SP versus not SP.
Before proceeding, we make three brief observations regarding the classification. First,
both the SP-L and the manipulable in the large columns of Table 1 include mechanisms that
explicitly use prices (e.g., multi-unit auctions), as well as mechanisms that do not use prices
(e.g., matching mechanisms). For the mechanisms that do use prices, the SP-L ones are
exactly those where an agent who takes prices as given wishes to report truthfully, such as
the uniform-price auction. Second, the table is consistent with both Milton Friedman’s (1960;
1991) argument in favor of uniform-price auctions over pay-as-bid auctions, and Alvin Roth’s
(1990; 1991; 2002) argument in favor of deferred acceptance over priority-match algorithms.
Notably, while both Friedman’s criticism of pay-as-bid auctions and Roth’s criticism of
priority-match algorithms were made on incentives grounds, the mechanisms they suggested
in their place are not SP but are SP-L. Third, with the exception of probabilistic serial,
none of the SP-L mechanisms satisfy a stronger, ex-post, notion of approximate strategyproofness. That is, the classification would not conform to the existing evidence, nor to
Friedman’s and Roth’s arguments, without the ex-interim perspective in the definition of
SP-L.

4.1

Obtaining the Classification

To show that a mechanism is not SP-L it suffices to identify an example of a distribution of
play under which agents may gain by misreporting, even in the limit. For SP-L mechanisms,

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

16

this section gives two easy-to-check sufficient conditions for a mechanism to be SP-L, which
directly yield the classification for all of the SP-L mechanisms in Table 1. Formal definitions
of each mechanism and detailed derivations are in Supplementary Appendix C.11
The first sufficient condition is envy-freeness, a fairness criterion which requires that no
player i prefers the assignment of another player j, for any realization of the reported payoff
types t.
Definition 5. A direct mechanism {(Φn )N , T } is envy-free (EF) if, for all i, j, n, t:
uti [Φni (t)] ≥ uti [Φnj (t)].
Theorem 1 below shows that EF implies SP-L. The connection between envy-freeness
and incentive compatibility in large markets was first observed by Hammond (1979), who
shows, in a continuum exchange economy, that EF implies SP. For related contributions see
Champsaur and Laroque (1981) and Jackson and Kremer (2007).
The mathematical intuition for why EF implies SP-L is as follows. In anonymous mechanisms, the gain to player i from misreporting as player j can be decomposed as the sum
of the gain from receiving j’s bundle, holding fixed the aggregate distribution of reports,
plus the gain from affecting the aggregate distribution of reports (expression (A.2) in Appendix A). Envy-freeness directly implies that the first component in this decomposition
is non-positive. Lemma A.1 then shows that the second component becomes negligible in
large markets. More precisely, even though there may exist realizations of the other players’
reports where player i’s gain from affecting the aggregate distribution is large (e.g., if by
misreporting he affects the clearing price in the uniform-price auction), his effect on the
interim distribution of the empirical distribution of reports vanishes with market size, at a
√
rate of essentially n. This yields both that EF implies SP-L and the convergence rate for
EF mechanisms as stated in Theorem 1.
Most of the mechanisms in the SP-L column of Table 1 are EF, with the only exceptions being approximate CEEI and deferred acceptance.12 To classify these mechanisms,
11

Two of these mechanisms do not fit the framework used in the body of the paper. Deferred acceptance
is a semi-anonymous mechanism, and the Walrasian mechanism has an infinite set of bundles. For details
of how we accommodate these generalizations, see Supplementary Appendix C. Moreover, to define some of
these mechanisms we make a selection from a correspondence. For example, in the Hylland and Zeckhauser
(1979) pseudomarket mechanism, individuals report preferences for objects, and a competitive equilibrium
is calculated. There exist preference profiles for which there are multiple equilibria. In the appendix, we
formally define the HZ mechanism as a mechanism that picks an arbitrary selection from this correspondence. We state similar formal definitions for the approximate CEEI and Generalized HZ mechanisms (see
Supplementary Appendix C).
12
Both approximate CEEI and deferred acceptance include as a special case the random serial dictatorship

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

17

we introduce a weakening of EF that we call envy-free but for tie breaking (EF-TB). A
mechanism is envy-free but for tie breaking if, after reports are submitted, the mechanism
runs a tie-breaking lottery, and allocations depend on reports and on the lottery. After the
lottery is realized, no participant envies another participant with a worse lottery number.
The simplest example is the random serial dictatorship mechanism for allocating objects
without using money. Random serial dictatorship orders participants according to a lottery,
and participants then take turns picking their favorite object out of the objects that are still
available. This mechanism has envy ex post, because a participant may prefer the allocation
of another participant who got a better lottery number. Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001)
have shown that the mechanism can also have envy before the lottery is drawn. However,
after the lottery is drawn, no participant envies another participant with a worse lottery
number, which means that this mechanism is envy-free but for tie breaking. Formally, the
definition is as follows.13
Definition 6. A direct mechanism {(Φn )N , T } is envy-free but for tie breaking (EFTB) if for each n there exists a function xn : (T × [0, 1])N → ∆(X0n ), symmetric over its
coordinates, such that

xn (t, l)dl

l∈[0,1]n

and, for all i, j, n, t, and l, if li ≥ lj then
uti [xni (t, l)] ≥ uti [xnj (t, l)].
The following theorem shows that either condition guarantees that a mechanism is SP-L.
Theorem 1. If a mechanism is EF-TB (and in particular if it is EF), then it is SP-L.

mechanisms, and n− 4 + for EF-TB mechanisms. Formally, if a mechanism is EF (EF-TB),

mechanism, which Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) show is not envy-free.
13
This definition is for anonymous mechanisms. The definition for semi-anonymous mechanisms, which is
needed for deferred acceptance, is contained in Supplementary Appendix B. The semi-anonymous version
of the definition can also be used for school choice problems in which there are multiple groups of students
with different priority classes (e.g., sibling priority or walk-zone priority).

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

18

The theorem shows that either condition can be used to classify new or existing mechanisms as SP-L. It also gives reasonable rates of convergence for the maximum possible gain
from manipulating a mechanism.
The first claim of Theorem 1 can also be stated in the language of implementation theory,
which we will introduce formally in Section 5. In this language the result is (informally):
Any social choice function F that depends only on payoff types and is EF or EF-TB is SP-L
implementable.
The proof of the theorem for the EF-TB case builds upon the argument for the EF case,
by showing that EF-TB mechanisms have small amounts of envy before lotteries are drawn
(Lemma A.2). This is accomplished with three basic ideas. First, how much player i envies
player j prior to the lottery draw equals the average envy by all type ti players towards type
tj players, as a consequence of anonymity. Second, it is possible to bound this average envy,
after a given lottery draw l, by how evenly distributed the lottery numbers in the vector l are.
Intuitively, if players of types ti and tj receive evenly distributed lottery numbers, average
envy has to be small. The final step is an application of a probabilistic bound known as the
Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality, which guarantees that lottery numbers are typically
very evenly distributed.

4.2

Relationship to the Theoretical Literature on Large Markets

The SP-L column of Table 1 organizes a large literature demonstrating the approximate
incentive compatibility of specific mechanisms in large markets. Our results show that a
number of mechanisms for which the literature established approximate incentive compatibility results are SP-L. This includes Walrasian mechanisms (Roberts and Postlewaite, 1976,
Hammond (1979) and Jackson and Manelli, 1997), double auctions (Rustichini et al., 1994
and Cripps and Swinkels, 2006), uniform-price auctions (Swinkels, 2001), deferred acceptance mechanisms (Immorlica and Mahdian, 2005 and Kojima and Pathak, 2009),14 and the
probabilistic serial mechanism (Kojima and Manea, 2010). We also obtain new results on
the Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979) pseudomarket mechanism, approximate CEEI (Budish,
2011), and the generalized Hylland-Zeckhauser mechanism (Budish et al., 2013), each of
14

Our assumption of a finite number of types is an important limitation in matching models. The problem
is that, as the market grows, we can only have a finite number of preference orderings over partners. This
contrasts with other large-market matching models, such as Kojima and Pathak (2009), Kojima et al. (2013),
Ashlagi et al. (2014), and Lee (2017). One interesting direction of future research is to generalize SP-L to
infinite sets of types, where there is a topological notion of types that are close to one another. This could
expand the applicability of the SP-L concept, especially to models like Lee (2017), where the set of types
has a natural topological structure.

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

19

whose large-market incentive properties had not previously been formally studied.
The single concept of SP-L and Theorem 1 classifies all of these mechanisms. In contrast,
the prior literature has employed different notions of approximate incentive compatibility
and different analysis techniques, tailored for each mechanism.15 Of course, analyses that
are tailored to specific mechanisms can yield a more nuanced understanding of the exact
forces pushing players away from truthful behavior in finite markets, as in the first-order
condition analysis of Rustichini et al. (1994) or the rejection chain analysis of Kojima and
Pathak (2009).

4.3

Relationship to Empirical Literature on Manipulability

For each of the manipulable in the large mechanisms in Table 1, there is explicit empirical
evidence that participants strategically misreport their preferences in practice. Furthermore,
misreporting harms design objectives such as efficiency or fairness. In this section we briefly
review this evidence.16
Consider first multi-unit auctions for government securities. Empirical analyses have
found considerable bid shading in discriminatory auctions (Hortaçsu and McAdams, 2010),
but negligible bid shading in uniform-price auctions, even with as few as 13 bidders (Kastl,
2011; Hortaçsu et al. (2015)). Friedman (1991) argued that the need to play strategically
in pay-as-bid auctions reduces entry of less sophisticated bidders, giving dealers a sheltered
market that facilitates collusion. In uniform-price auctions, by contrast, “You do not have
to be a specialist” to participate, since all bidders pay the market-clearing price. Consistent
15

This note elaborates on the different concepts used in the literature. Roberts and Postlewaite (1976) ask
that truthful reporting is ex-post approximately optimal for all opponent reports where equilibrium prices
vary continuously with reports. Hammond (1979) shows that the Walrasian mechanism satisfies exact SP in
a continuum economy. Rustichini et al. (1994) study the exact Bayes-Nash equilibria of double auctions in
large markets, and bound the rate at which strategic misreporting vanishes with market size. Swinkels (2001)
studies both exact Bayes-Nash equilibria and -Bayes-Nash equilibria of the uniform-price and pay-as-bid
auctions. Kojima and Pathak (2009) study -Nash equilibria of the doctor-proposing deferred acceptance
algorithm assuming complete information about preferences on the hospital side of the market and incomplete
information about preferences on the doctor side of the market. In an appendix they also consider -BayesNash equilibria, in which there is incomplete information about preferences on both sides of the market.
Kojima and Manea (2010) show that probabilistic serial satisfies exact SP, without any modification, in a
large enough finite market.
16
We note that even for SP mechanisms preference reporting is not perfect. Rees-Jones (2015) provides
survey evidence of misreporting in the US medical resident match on the doctor side of the market (for
which truthful reporting is a dominant strategy), which he attributes in part to students misunderstanding
the strategic environment (see also Hassidim et al., 2015). Laboratory studies have also found misreporting
in SP mechanisms, though these experiments find significantly lower rates of misreporting in SP mechanisms
than in easily manipulable mechanisms (Chen and Sönmez, 2006 and Featherstone and Niederle, 2011) and
significantly lower rates of misreporting when it is obvious to participants why the SP mechanism is SP (Li,
2015).

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

20

with Friedman’s view, Jegadeesh (1993) shows that pay-as-bid auctions depressed revenues
to the US Treasury during the Salomon Squeeze in 1991, and Malvey and Archibald (1998)
find that the US Treasury’s adoption of uniform-price auctions in the mid-1990s broadened
participation. Cross-country evidence is also consistent with Friedman’s argument, as Brenner et al. (2009) find a positive relationship between a country’s using uniform-price auctions
and indices of ease of doing business and economic freedom, whereas pay-as-bid auctions are
positively related with indices of corruption and of bank-sector concentration.
Next, consider the Boston mechanism for school choice. Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2006) find
evidence of a mix of both sophisticated strategic misreporting and unsophisticated naive
truthtelling; see also recent empirical work by Agarwal and Somaini (2014) and Hwang
(2014). Sophisticated parents strategically misreport their preferences by ranking a relatively
unpopular school high on their submitted preference list. Unsophisticated parents, on the
other hand, frequently play a dominated strategy in which they waste the highest positions
on their rank-ordered list on popular schools that are unattainable for them. In extreme
cases, participants who play a dominated strategy end up not receiving any of the schools
they ask for.
Next, consider the mechanisms used in practice for the multi-unit assignment problem
of course allocation. In the bidding points auction, Krishna and Ünver (2008) use both field
and laboratory evidence to show that students strategically misreport their preferences, and
that this harms welfare. Budish (2011) provides additional evidence that some students
get very poor outcomes under this mechanism; in particular students sometimes get zero
of the courses they bid for. In the Harvard Business School draft mechanism, Budish and
Cantillon (2012) use data consisting of students’ stated preferences and their underlying
true preferences to show that students strategically misreport their preferences. They show
that misreporting harms welfare relative both to a counterfactual in which students report
truthfully, and relative to a counterfactual in which students misreport, but optimally. They
also provide direct evidence that some students fail to play best responses, which supports the
view that Bayes-Nash equilibria are less robust in practice than dominant-strategy equilibria.
For labor market clearinghouses, Roth (1990, 1991, 2002) surveys a wide variety of evidence that shows that variations on priority matching mechanisms perform poorly in practice,
while variations on Gale and Shapley’s deferred acceptance algorithm perform well. Roth
emphasizes that the former are unstable under truthful play whereas the latter are stable
under truthful play. By contrast, we emphasize that the former are not SP-L whereas the
latter are SP-L.

SP-L is Approximately Costless in Large Markets Relative to Bayes-Nash

This section shows that, in large markets, SP-L is in a precise sense approximately costless to
impose relative to Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility. Formally, we give conditions under
which, if it is possible to implement a social choice function with a Bayes-Nash incentive
compatible mechanism, then it is possible to approximately implement this social choice
function with an SP-L mechanism. The exception is that there can be a large cost of using
SP-L if the intended social choice function is discontinuous in agents’ beliefs.

5.1

Social Choice Functions and Type Spaces

To formally state the result we need to introduce the notions of social choice functions
and type spaces. These concepts will allow us to describe the social outcomes produced
by mechanisms such as pay-as-bid auctions or the Boston mechanism, which are not SP-L
but which have Bayes-Nash equilibria that depend on agents’ beliefs. Our definition of type
spaces is similar to that in the robust mechanism design literature as in Bergemann and
Morris (2005).
A type space Ω = ((Ωn,i )n∈N,i=1,...,n , t̂, π̂) consists of a measurable set of types Ωn,i , for
every market size n and agent i, and measurable maps t̂ and π̂. These maps associate, with
each type ωi in a given set Ωn,i , a payoff type t̂(ωi ) in T , and beliefs π̂(ωi ) over the joint
distribution of opponent types (ω1 , . . . , ωi−1 , ωi+1 , . . . , ωn ) in ×j6=i Ωn,j . The type space Ωn
for market size n is the product of the individual type spaces Ωn,i . Thus, a type encodes
a participant’s information about her preferences and about other participants’ preferences
and beliefs. For our purposes, it is sufficient to restrict attention to type spaces that are
symmetric across players, so that Ωn,i is the same set for all i, and with an onto function t̂
so that all payoff types are possible.
Given a type space Ω, a social choice function is a sequence F = (F n )n∈N of functions
F n : Ωn −→ ∆(X0 )n .
Note, importantly, that we allow social choice functions to depend on both preferences and
beliefs, not only on preferences. The reason is that the outcomes of many commonly used
mechanisms vary with both preferences and beliefs. For example, outcomes of the payas-bid auction or the Boston mechanism depend on what participants believe about other

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

22

participants’ preferences and information; holding an agent’s preferences fixed, their beliefs
affect how much they will shade their bid, or whether they will take a risk and rank a popular
school first. To discuss the social choice functions implemented by these mechanisms, we
need to include beliefs in the definition of a social choice function. Our definition differs
from that in Bergemann and Morris (2005), where social choice functions only depend on
payoff types. Our definition is similar to that in the literature on implementation with
incomplete information (as in Postlewaite and Schmeidler, 1986 or Jackson, 1991), where
social choice functions may depend on payoff-irrelevant information.17 We say that a social
choice function depends only on payoff types if, for all n, and all ω and ω 0 in Ωn,i such
that t̂(ωi ) = t̂(ωi0 ) for all i, we have F n (ω) = F n (ω 0 ).
Much applied work in mechanism design considers Bayesian equilibria where agents have
a common, i.i.d. prior µ about payoff types, and know their own type.18 To describe the
outcomes of such equilibria for a range of priors µ, we need a type space that includes the
union of these simple type spaces for a range of values of µ.
We now define such a type space, which we denote as Ω∗ . Formally, for all n, let
¯ }.
Ω∗n,i = {(ti , µ) : ti ∈ T, µ ∈ ∆T
For any ωi = (ti , µ) ∈ Ω∗n,i , let t̂(ωi ) = ti . The beliefs of type ωi are
π̂(ωi )(ω−i ) = 0
if, for any j 6= i, the first element of ωj is not µ, and the beliefs are
π̂(ωi )(ω−i ) = Πj6=i µ(t̂(ωj ))
17

Restricting attention to social choice functions that only depend on payoff types is reasonable if the
social choice function is interpreted as a map from preference profiles to socially optimal alternatives, as
in the interpretation in Maskin (1999) p. 24, which goes back to Arrow (1951). Following Bergemann and
Morris (2005), the robust mechanism design literature often restricts attention to social choice functions that
only depend on payoff types. However, we use social choice functions to describe the allocations produced
by equilibria of Bayesian mechanisms, which in many applications depend on beliefs. For that reason,
we follow the literature on implementation with incomplete information, which typically allows for social
choice functions to depend on payoff-irrelevant information. For example, Jackson (1991) p. 463 defines
a social choice function as a function from a set of states to allocations. In particular, the social choice
function may produce different outcomes in states where agents have the same preferences, but different
information about the preferences of other agents. Maskin and Sjöström’s (2002) (pp. 276-277) discussion
of the Bayesian implementation literature uses a similar definition. Likewise, Postlewaite and Schmeidler’s
(1986) social welfare correspondences and Palfrey and Srivastava’s (1989) social choice sets may depend on
payoff-irrelevant information.

This type space is a particular case of what Chung and Ely (2007) and Bergemann and Morris (2005)
call naive type spaces.

Limit Bayes-Nash and SP-L Implementability

This subsection defines the implementability notions that we need to state the theorem, and
a regularity condition on social choice functions.
We begin by defining implementability in limit Bayes-Nash equilibria. It will be useful to
extend the function Φn linearly to distributions over vectors of actions. Given a distribution
m̄ ∈ ∆(An ) over vectors of actions, let
Φn (m̄) =

X

m̄(a) · Φn (a).

(5.1)

a∈An

Likewise, given an action ai and a distribution m̄ ∈ ∆(An−1 ) over n − 1 actions, let
Φni (ai , m̄) =

X

m̄(a−i ) · Φni (ai , a−i ).

a−i ∈An−1

Given a mechanism {(Φn )N , A} and type space Ω, a strategy σ is defined as a map from
Ωn,i to ∆A. Given a strategy σ, market size n and a vector of belief types ω ∈ Ωn , let
σ(ω) ∈ ∆(An ) denote the associated distribution over vectors of actions.
Definition 7. Given a mechanism {(Φn )N , A} and type space Ω, the strategy σ ∗ is a limit
Bayes-Nash equilibrium if each participant’s strategy becomes arbitrarily close to optimal
as the market grows large. Formally,19 for all  > 0 there exists n0 such that, for all n ≥ n0 ,
ωi ∈ Ωn,i , ai in the support of σ ∗ (ωi ), and a0i ∈ A:

The integral equals the expected gain for participant i with type ωi to change her strategy. It is an

anism ((Φn )n∈N , A) with a limit Bayes-Nash equilibrium σ ∗ such that
F n (ω) = Φn (σ ∗ (ω))
for all ω in the type space Ω for which F is defined.
The theorem also requires the following regularity condition.
Definition 8. A social choice function (F n )n∈N defined over Ω∗ is continuous at a prior
µ0 if, given  > 0, there exists n0 and a neighborhood N of µ0 such that the following holds.
Consider any n ≥ n0 , and any two vectors of types ω and ω 0 , with ωi = (ti , µ) and ωi0 = (ti , µ0 )
for all i, where µ, µ0 , and emp[t] belong to N . Then, for any such n, ω, and ω 0 ,
kF n (ω) − F n (ω 0 )k < .
The social choice function is continuous if it is continuous at every full support prior.
That is, a social choice function defined over Ω∗ is continuous if, in large enough markets,
social outcomes vary continuously with beliefs. This is a substantial restriction, even for
social choice functions that are Bayes-Nash implementable. In the working paper version
of this article we established a version of Theorem 2 that used a weaker condition, called
quasi-continuity. See Section 7.2 for further discussion.
A direct revelation mechanism ((Φn )n∈N , T ) approximately implements a social choice
¯ , there exists n0
function F = (F n )n∈N defined over Ω∗ if, for every  > 0 and prior µ in ∆T
such that, for all n ≥ n0 and ti ∈ T ,
kf n (ti , µ) − φn (ti , µ)k < .
We say that F is approximately SP-L implementable if there exists an SP-L mechanism that approximately implements F .

Construction Theorem

We now state the main result of this section.
Theorem 2. Consider a social choice function F = (F n )n∈N defined over Ω∗ , the union of
all common prior, i.i.d., full support type spaces. If F is continuous and limit Bayes-Nash
implementable, then F is approximately SP-L implementable.

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

25

Proof Sketch. The proof of Theorem 2 is by construction. We provide a detailed sketch
as follows, with full details contained in Appendix A.
(Fn )n∈N is limit Bayes-Nash implementable. Therefore, there exists a mechanism ((Φn )n∈N , A)
with a limit Bayes-Nash equilibrium σ ∗ such that
F n (ω) = Φn (σ ∗ (ω))
for all n ≥ 0 and vectors of types ω in Ω∗n . Construct the direct mechanism ((Ψn )n∈N , T ) as
follows. Given a vector of payoff types t, let emp[t] ∈ ∆T be the empirical distribution of
payoff types in t. Given a market size n, let
Ψn (t) = Φn (σ ∗ ((t1 , emp[t]), . . . , (tn , emp[t]))).

(5.2)

In words, Ψn plays action σ ∗ (ti , emp[t]) for agent i who reports ti , where emp[t] is the
empirical distribution of reported payoff types. The constructed mechanism Ψn can be
interpreted as a proxy mechanism. Ψn plays the original mechanism Φn on each agent’s
behalf, using the limit Bayes-Nash equilibrium strategy σ ∗ , and assuming that players believe
that payoff types are i.i.d according to the empirical distribution of payoff types emp[t].
We need to establish two facts. First, the constructed mechanism yields approximately
the same outcome as the social choice function. This follows from continuity and from
the law of large numbers. Specifically, assume that participant i reports ti , and that other
¯ . The law of large numbers
participants’ reports are i.i.d. according to a distribution µ in ∆T
implies that emp[t] converges to m in probability as the market grows large. Continuity then
implies that the expected bundle received by agent i is close to f n (ti , µ).
Second, we need to show that the constructed mechanism is SP-L. Suppose that agent i’s
payoff type is ti but that she reports t0i , and that other participants report i.i.d. according to a
¯ . We have already established that agent i receives a bundle that is close
distribution µ in ∆T
to f n (t0i , µ). Because the social choice function is limit Bayes-Nash implementable, agent i’s
utility for f n (t0i , µ) cannot be much higher than her utility for f n (ti , µ). As the market grows,
these approximations improve, and the maximum possible gain from misreporting converges
to 0. This shows that the constructed mechanism is SP-L.

Relationship to the Revelation Principle The construction used in the proof of Theorem 2 is related to the traditional Bayes-Nash direct revelation mechanism construction
(Myerson, 1979). In a traditional Bayes-Nash direct revelation mechanism, the mechanism

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

26

designer and participants have a common knowledge prior about payoff types, say µ0 . The
mechanism announces a Bayes-Nash equilibrium strategy σ ∗ (·, µ0 ), and plays σ ∗ (ti , µ0 ) on
behalf of an agent who reports ti . Truthful reporting is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.
In contrast, our constructed mechanism does not depend on a prior. Instead, the mechanism infers a prior from the empirical distribution of agents’ play (cf. Segal (2003); Baliga
and Vohra (2003)). If agents indeed play truthfully, this inference is correct in the limit.
But if the agents misreport, so that the empirical m̂ is very different from the prior µ0 , our
mechanism adjusts each agent’s play to be the Bayes-Nash equilibrium play in a world where
the prior was in fact m̂. As a result, an agent who reports her preferences truthfully remains
happy to have done so even if the other agents misreport, unlike in a traditional Bayes-Nash
direct revelation mechanism, so the constructed mechanism is SP-L rather than Bayes-Nash.
Moreover, the constructed mechanism is prior free and consistent with the Wilson doctrine,
unlike a traditional Bayes-Nash direct revelation mechanism. The mechanism designer need
not know the prior to run the mechanism, and the participants need not know the prior to
play optimally.

Application: The Boston Mechanism

The school choice literature has debated the desirability of the commonly used Boston mechanism for student assignment. While the mechanism has good efficiency properties, it has
been criticized because it gives students strong incentives to misreport preferences. This section applies Theorem 2 to show that there exists a mechanism that produces approximately
the same outcomes as the Boston mechanism, but is SP-L. We begin by giving a formal
definition of the Boston mechanism and our results, and then discuss how this contributes
to the debate in the literature.

6.1

Definition of the Boston Mechanism

The set of bundles is a set of schools X0 = S ∪ {∅}. In a market of size n, there are bqs · nc
seats available in school s in S, where qs ∈ (0, 1) denotes the proportion of the market that s
can accommodate and b·c is the floor function. It is assumed that X0 includes a null school
∅ that is in excess supply. An agent of payoff type ti ∈ T has a utility function uti over X0 ,
with no indifferences. The utility of the null school is normalized to 0. In particular, all
agents strictly prefer any of the proper schools to the null school.

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

27

We consider a simplified version of the Boston mechanism with a single round.20 The
action space is the set of proper schools A = S, so that each student points to a school.
If the number of students pointing to school s is lower than the number of seats, then all
of those students are allocated to school s. If there are more students who point to s than
its capacity, then students are randomly rationed, and those who do not obtain a seat in s
are allocated to the null school. Formally, given a vector of reports a, the allocation Φni (a)
assigns i to school ai with probability

Results

In the appendix, we show that the Boston mechanism has equilibria σ ∗ where σ ∗ (ti , µ)
¯ . Theorem 2 then yields the following corollary:
depends continuously on beliefs µ for µ ∈ ∆T
Corollary 1 (SP-L implementation of the Boston mechanism). The Boston mechanism has
limit Bayes-Nash equilibria that depend continuously on beliefs. For any such equilibrium
σ ∗ , the direct mechanism constructed according to equation (5.2) is SP-L, and, in the large
market limit, for any prior, truthful play of the direct mechanism produces the same outcomes
as equilibrium play of σ ∗ .
Interestingly, the SP-L mechanism constructed by (5.2) closely resembles the Hylland
and Zeckhauser (1979) pseudo-market mechanism for single-unit assignment.21 In the constructed mechanism, agents report their types, the mechanism computes the equilibrium
market-clearing probabilities associated with the distribution of reports, and each student
20

This simplified version of the Boston mechanism streamlines the exposition. However, this simplification
means that the result in this section is stylized. An interesting question for future research is to extend
the result to the standard version of the Boston mechanism, and to variations such as the adaptive Boston
mechanism (Harless, 2014; Dur, 2015; Mennle and Seuken, 2015).

mechanism’s Bayes-Nash equilibria and Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979).

points to their most-preferred school given their reported types and the computed probabilities. In Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979)’s mechanism, agents report their types, the
mechanism computes equilibrium market-clearing prices given the distribution of reports,
and each student purchases the lottery they like best given their reported types and the
computed prices.

6.3

Discussion: the Debate over the Boston Mechanism

Our analysis offers a new perspective to an ongoing market design debate concerning the
Boston mechanism. The earliest papers on the Boston mechanism, Abdulkadiroğlu and
Sönmez (2003) and Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2006), criticized the mechanism on the grounds
that it is not SP, and proposed that the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm be
used instead.22 These papers had a major policy impact as they led to the Gale-Shapley
algorithm’s eventual adoption for use in practice (cf. Roth, 2008).
A second generation of papers on the Boston mechanism, Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2011);
Miralles (2009); Featherstone and Niederle (2011), made a more positive case for the mechanism. They argued that while the Boston mechanism is not SP, it has Bayes-Nash equilibria
that are attractive. In particular, it has Bayes-Nash equilibria that yield greater student
welfare than do the dominant strategy equilibria of the Gale-Shapley procedure. Perhaps,
these papers argue, the earlier papers were too quick to dismiss the Boston mechanism.
However, these second-generation papers rely on students being able to reach the attractive Bayes-Nash equilibria. This raises several potential questions: is common knowledge
a reasonable assumption? Will students be able to calculate the desired equilibrium? Will
unsophisticated students be badly harmed?
Corollary 1 shows that, in a large market, it is possible to obtain the attractive welfare properties of the Bayes-Nash equilibria identified by these second-generation papers on
the Boston mechanism, but without the robustness problems associated with Bayes-Nash
mechanisms.
We make three caveats regarding whether the constructed mechanism is appropriate for
practical use. First, participants may find that a proxy mechanism like ours, or similar mechanisms like the Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979) pseudomarket mechanism, are too difficult
to understand (i.e., opaque). Second, reporting von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences accurately may be difficult for participants. Therefore, with respect to these first two caveats,
22

In two-sided matching, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is strategy proof for the proposing side of the market
and SP-L for the non-proposing side of the market. In school choice only the student side of the market is
strategic, with schools being non-strategic players whose preferences are determined by public policy.

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

29

to take the proxy mechanism seriously for practice one needs to explain it in a transparent
way, and to design and validate a user interface for accurately reporting preferences. While
these are important issues, they are addressable; the issues are similar to those dealt with in
Budish and Kessler’s (2016) practical implementation of an SP-L course allocation mechanism. The third caveat is that there is an ongoing empirical debate on the magnitude of the
welfare gains at stake. That is, on the difference in welfare between Bayes-Nash equilibrium
play of the Boston mechanism and truthful play of the Gale-Shapley mechanism (Agarwal
and Somaini, 2014; Casalmiglia et al., 2014; Hwang, 2014). If these gains are small, then the
simpler Gale-Shapley mechanism is likely more desirable.

Extensions and Discussion
Semi-Anonymity

Our analysis focuses on mechanisms that are anonymous, meaning that each agent’s outcome
is a symmetric function of her own action and the distribution of all actions. In Supplementary Appendix B we generalize key definitions and results to the case of semi-anonymous
mechanisms, as defined in Kalai (2004). A mechanism is semi-anonymous if each agent belongs to one of a finite number of groups, and her outcome is a symmetric function of her
own action, her group, and the distribution of actions within each group. This generalization is useful for two reasons. First, it allows our analysis to cover more mechanisms. For
instance, double auctions are semi-anonymous if buyers and sellers belong to distinct groups;
two-sided matching markets are semi-anonymous under the assumption that the number of
possible types of match partners is finite (cf. footnote 14); and school choice mechanisms
are semi-anonymous if there are multiple priority classes. Second, it allows results and concepts stated for i.i.d. distributions to be extended to more general distributions. See also
the discussion below in Section 7.5 about generalizing i.i.d. to distributions with aggregate
uncertainty.

7.2

Relaxing Continuity

Theorem 2 assumes continuity of the given social choice function. While this assumption
has an intuitive appeal, it is a substantial assumption. Some well-known mechanisms violate
it. For example, in pay-as-bid and uniform-price auctions, even though a small change in
the prior typically has only a small effect on agents’ bids, this small change in bids can

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

30

have a large (i.e., discontinuous) effect on the number of units some bidder wins or the
market-clearing price.
In the working paper version of this article (Azevedo and Budish, 2016), we show that a
weaker version of Theorem 2 obtains under a condition that we call quasi-continuity. Quasicontinuity allows for the desired social choice function to have discontinuities, with respect to
both the prior and the empirical distribution of reports, but requires that the discontinuities
are in a certain sense knife-edge. Roughly, any discontinuity is surrounded by regions in
which outcomes are continuous. Under this condition, the conclusion of the theorem is as
follows. If the social choice function is continuous at a given prior µ0 , then, as before, there
exists an SP-L mechanism that gives agents the same outcomes in the large-market limit.
If the social choice function is not continuous at µ0 , then there exists an SP-L mechanism
that gives agents a convex combination of the outcomes they would obtain under the desired
social choice function, for a set of priors in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of µ0 .
A question that remains open for future research is to fully characterize the conditions
under which there is no gap between Bayes-Nash and SP-L in large markets. The working
paper lists counterexamples that fail quasi-continuity, and in which the construction does not
approximate the desired social choice function, even for the weaker form of approximation
described above. However, the counterexamples are far from market design applications.
Moreover, the fact that the construction leaves a gap between Bayes-Nash and SP-L proves
that our method of proof does not work, but does not prove that there is a gap.
Given these open questions, we do not see Theorem 2 as providing definitive proof that
there is never an advantage to using Bayes-Nash over SP-L in large markets. Rather, we see
the results as suggesting that, for the purposes of practical market design, a researcher may
be justified searching in the space of SP-L mechanisms rather than broadening her search
to include Bayes-Nash. For there to be a meaningful gain to using Bayes-Nash over SP-L in
large markets, the Bayes-Nash social choice function must fail quasi-continuity, which means
that its outcomes are extremely sensitive to agents’ beliefs and reports. In addition, the
researcher must believe the usual conditions required for Bayes-Nash equilibrium, such as
common knowledge and strategic sophistication, which seems unrealistic in the context of a
highly discontinuous mechanism.

7.3

Discussion: Strategic Simplicity and Fairness

In the introduction we emphasized strategic simplicity and fairness as reasons why the market
design literature has found SP so compelling relative to Bayes-Nash, alongside the traditional

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

31

robustness arguments associated with Wilson (1987) and Bergemann and Morris (2005). In
this sub-section we briefly formalize the sense in which SP-L mechanisms approximate these
appeals of SP.
SP-L mechanisms are strategically straightforward in the following sense: for any full¯ about opponent play, and any cost c > 0 of calculating an optimal
support beliefs m ∈ ∆T
response, in a large enough market it is optimal to simply report truthfully and avoid the
cost c. This cost c might be the cost of gathering information about the rules of the game,
or about opponents’ preferences and beliefs, or about which equilibrium will be played, etc.
It could also be a real cost of lying about one’s type, as in Kartik (2009). In the terminology
of Roth (2008), truthful reporting is a safe strategy.
SP-L mechanisms are fair to unsophisticated players in the following sense: for any
¯ , and any c > 0, in a large enough market the cost of being
distribution of play m ∈ ∆T
unsophisticated and just reporting truthfully is less than c. By unsophisticated players
we mean players who are able to express their own preferences, but who do not have the
information or strategic sophistication to misreport their preferences optimally. Examples
include parents who choose dominated strategies in school choice mechanisms, as in Pathak
and Sönmez (2008), and individual investors participating in government bond auctions, as
discussed by Friedman (1991).

7.4

Discussion: Voting, Public Goods and Strict SP-L

Our motivation and analysis has focused on canonical problems in market design. A natural
question is whether SP-L is a useful concept in mechanism design problems outside of market
design, such as voting and public goods provision. We suggest that the answer is no, and that
thinking about the difference between such problems and market design problems suggests
a modest strengthening of SP-L that may be useful.
The key difference between voting and public goods problems, on the one hand, and the
market design problems we have emphasized, is that in voting and public goods provision
every agent gets the same outcome.23 Technically, this can be accommodated in our frame23

For expositional simplicity our discussion of public goods provision focuses on the case where agents’
payments vary with the societal decision (e.g., whether or not to build a park, or whether to build an expensive
park, a cheap park, or no park) but not, conditional on the societal decision, with their specific report. For
public goods mechanisms in which agents’ payments do vary with their specific report (conditioning on the
societal decision), and preferences are quasi-linear, the conclusions are as follows. Such mechanisms are
SP-L if and only if, in the large market limit, all types make the same expected payment from the interim
perspective, for any full-support i.i.d. distribution of others’ reports. Such mechanisms are never strictly
SP-L. If they satisfy the my play matters condition, it is because agents’ reports can affect their payments
in the large market limit, not the social decision; in such a case the mechanism is manipulable in the large.

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

32

work by letting X0 denote the set of social alternatives and defining the set Yn of feasible
allocations in a market of size n to be the set (x, x, . . . , x)x∈X0 , i.e., the set of allocations
in which all n agents get the same outcome. This environment allows for a wide range of
voting mechanisms. For example, agents report their preferences and the mechanism chooses
the alternative that is the majority winner, or the Borda count winner, and so on. In this
environment, any anonymous mechanism is SP-L. This follows from the observation that
any mechanism is trivially envy-free, because all agents get the same outcome, and Theorem
1. However, such mechanisms are SP-L for the trivial reason that in the large market limit
each agent has zero impact on their outcome. By contrast, in market design problems, while
each agent has zero effect on aggregate statistics such as prices, each agent has a large effect
on what they themselves receive given the aggregates.
To clarify the distinction between the market design problems of interest in the present
paper and problems such as voting and public goods provision in which all agents get the
same outcome, we introduce the following mild strengthening of SP-L:
Definition 9. The direct mechanism {(Φn )N , T } is strictly strategy-proof in the large
(strictly SP-L) if it is SP-L, and, in addition, for any ti ∈ T there exists a t0i ∈ T and
¯ such that:
m ∈ ∆T
lim inf uti [φn (ti , m)] − uti [φn (t0i , m)] > 0.
n→∞

If the mechanism has a limit, this additional requirement is equivalent to, for any ti ∈ T ,
¯ such that
there exists a t0 ∈ T and m ∈ ∆T
i

uti [φ∞ (ti , m)] > uti [φ∞ (t0i , m)].
In words, strict SP-L requires that truthful reporting is at least approximately as good
as all other reports (as in Definition 4), and, in addition, is strictly preferred to at least some
other report for at least some distribution. This is a modest additional requirement and it is
easy to see that all of the SP-L mechanisms in Table 1 satisfy it. At the same time, voting
and public goods mechanisms, in which all agents get the same outcome, are easily seen to
fail this condition.24
(To avoid potential confusion, note that in the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, while agents’ payments
do vary with their reports in finite markets – e.g., if they are pivotal in the decision to provide the expensive
park – in the large market limit all types’ payments are zero because no agent is pivotal.)
24
Carroll (2013) introduces an interesting approach to studying approximate incentive compatibility for
voting rules. His criterion, like SP-L, evaluates incentives to misreport from the interim perspective with
respect to i.i.d. distributions of others’ play. But, since in voting all mechanisms are trivially SP-L, he studies
the rate at which incentives to misreport vanish as the market grows large. Also of interest are d’Aspremont

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

33

Theorems 1 and 2 are stated and proved for SP-L, not strict SP-L, but fortunately they
can be applied as is to reach conclusions for strict SP-L under a mild additional condition.
Definition 10. The direct mechanism {(Φn )N , T } satisfies the my play matters condition
¯ such that the limit at distribution of
if, for any ti ∈ T , there exists a t0 ∈ T and m ∈ ∆T
i

play m exists and
uti [φ∞ (ti , m)] 6= uti [φ∞ (t0i , m)].
In words, the my play matters condition requires that reporting truthfully affects one’s
utility as compared to at least some potential misreport and distribution. It is easy to see
that all of the market design mechanisms we mention throughout the paper, both those that
are SP-L and those that are manipulable in the large, satisfy the condition, whereas, again,
voting and public goods mechanisms fail it. The following is immediate:
Remark 1. If a mechanism is SP-L and satisfies the my play matters condition, it is strictly
SP-L.
Remark 1 allows results for SP-L to be translated into results for strict SP-L by checking
the my play matters condition. Theorem 1 shows that if a mechanism is EF or EF-TB,
it is SP-L. Therefore, by Remark 1, if the mechanism also satisfies the my play matters
condition, it is strictly SP-L. Similarly, in Theorem 2, if the mechanism constructed in the
proof satisfies the my play matters condition, then it is SP-L.25
One could imagine a stronger notion of strict SP-L in which, instead of requiring that for
each true type ti there exists some misreport t0i and distribution m for which the preference
to report truthfully is strict, we instead require that for every true type ti and misreport ti ’,
there exists such a distribution m. This condition would require a correspondingly stronger
my play matters condition for Remark 1 to follow. The advantage of our version of strict
and Peleg (1988) and Majumdar and Sen (2004), who study ordinal Bayesian incentive compatibility (OBIC).
OBIC strengthens BIC by requiring that reporting one’s ordinal preferences truthfully is optimal for any
cardinal representation of an agent’s true ordinal preferences, but at the same time OBIC is weaker than SP
because it evaluates incentives to misreport with respect to a common-knowledge prior about the distribution
of others’ reports. While mathematically unrelated to SP-L, OBIC is in a similar spirit in that it identifies
a compelling criterion between BIC and SP.
25
This is a condition on the social choice function F considered, in the sense that the mechanism is a
well-defined construction that depends on the social choice function. The condition can alternatively be
stated directly in terms of the social choice function. The condition of my play matters on the constructed
mechanism is equivalent to the following condition on the social choice function. For every ti in T , there
¯ and t0 in T such that the limits of f n (ti , m) and f n (t0 , m) as n goes to infinity exist, and
exists m in ∆T

34

SP-L is that both it and the corresponding my play matters condition are easier to check, and
it is strong enough to usefully distinguish canonical market design mechanisms (construed
broadly to include Walrasian allocation as well as auctions, assignment, matching, etc.) from
voting and public goods mechanisms. That said, some researchers may find the stronger
notion to be more compelling for their particular application.

7.5

Discussion: Aggregate Uncertainty

SP-L requires that agents find it approximately optimal to report truthfully for any fullsupport i.i.d. distribution of opponent play. We motivated this assumption by arguing that it
is more realistic to assume that agents have beliefs about the distribution of opponents’ play,
rather than about the precise realization of opponents’ play, as in SP, or in the traditional
notion of approximate SP. Still, this is a lot of information. A natural question is to what
extent SP-L is robust to participants having even less information. More specifically, what
happens in the realistic case where participants have aggregate uncertainty?
We can formalize this question as follows. Consider a participant whose aggregate uncertainty about the distribution of others’ play can be modeled by a finite set of states of the
world, and beliefs about opponent play that are i.i.d. conditional on the state. Formally,
she believes that with probability pk her opponents play i.i.d. with probability distribution
¯ , out of a finite set of possible full-support distributions m1 , . . . , mK . Observe
mk ∈ ∆T
that her belief about her opponents’ overall distribution of play is not i.i.d., but is i.i.d.
conditional on the resolution of aggregate uncertainty as indexed by k. If a mechanism is
SP-L, will a participant who faces aggregate uncertainty wish to report optimally in a large
market?
It is straightforward to see that the answer to this question is affirmative. SP-L requires
that reporting truthfully is approximately optimal, in a large enough market, for any full
support i.i.d. distribution of play. This implies that reporting truthfully is approximately
optimal, in a large enough market, for any finite mixture of full support i.i.d. distributions of
play. Formally, for any  > 0, there exists nk such that the gain from misreporting conditional
on opponent play being i.i.d. according to mk is less than . Therefore, if n is greater than
the maximum of the nk , the participant cannot gain more than  by misreporting.
Since a mechanism being SP-L implies that a mechanism is incentive compatible in a
large market under aggregate uncertainty, the conclusions of Theorems 1 and 2 generalize to
accommodate aggregate uncertainty, and all of the mechanisms in the SP-L column of Table
1 are incentive compatible in large markets under aggregate uncertainty. The key thing to

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

35

emphasize is that, while SP-L evaluates the incentives to misreport from the perspective
of an agent who perceives others’ play as full-support i.i.d., it requires that the agent finds
truthful reporting to be approximately optimal for any such distribution. Thus, while it
may seem that SP-L only gives incentives for truth-telling if a participant has these very
specific i.i.d. beliefs, in fact if a mechanism is SP-L truthful reporting is approximately
optimal for any convex combintation of i.i.d. full-support priors. This means that reporting
truthfully is approximately optimal in an SP-L mechanism under a much more general set
of circumstances, including when there is aggregate uncertainty.

Related Literature

Our paper is related to three broad lines of literature: the literature on how large markets
ease incentive constraints for specific mechanisms; the literature on implementation theory;
and the literature on the role of strategy-proofness in market design. We discuss each in
turn.
Large Markets Our paper is most closely related to the large theory literature that has
studied how market size can ease incentive constraints for specific mechanisms. We discussed
this literature in detail in Section 4.2. It is important to highlight that the aim of our
paper is quite different from, and complementary to, this literature. Whereas papers such
as Roberts and Postlewaite (1976) provide a defense of a specific pre-existing mechanism
based on its approximate incentives properties in large markets, our paper aims to justify
SP-L as a general desideratum for market design. In particular, our paper can be seen as
providing justification for focusing on SP-L when designing new mechanisms. Another point
of difference versus this literature is that our criterion itself is new; see fn. 15 for full details
of the approximate incentives criteria used in this prior literature.
Implementation Theory Our paper is closely related to the implementation theory literature, both in our high-level goals and in specific ideas. The goal of implementation theory
is to determine what social choice rules can be implemented by some mechanism, under
different solution concepts, and to find applicable necessary and/or sufficient conditions for
implementation (Maskin and Sjöström, 2002). In the same fashion, our paper proposes an
incentive compatibility concept, SP-L. Theorem 1 gives applicable sufficient conditions for a
mechanism to be SP-L. Theorem 2 shows that the set of social choice functions that can be
implemented is not much more restrictive than under Bayes-Nash equilibria (with the caveats

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

36

above). More specifically, our paper is related to the literature on partial implementation,
which considers whether a social choice rule is implemented by at least one equilibrium of a
mechanism, as in Hurwicz (1972) and Bergemann and Morris (2005). This is in contrast to
full implementation, which considers whether a social choice rule is implemented by every
equilibrium of a mechanism, as in much of the implementation theory literature.26 Specific
ideas in our paper relate to three strands of the literature.
First, our paper is related to the literature on implementation in dominant strategies.
One of the key findings of the early implementation theory literature is that implementation
in dominant strategies is extremely restrictive. Hurwicz (1972) showed that it is impossible to
implement the Walrasian correspondence with a strategy-proof mechanism. This impossibility is due to incentive compatibility conditions, so that dominant strategy implementation is
restrictive even if we ignore the multiple equilibrium issue of full implementation. Subsequent
studies showed that dominant strategy implementation is restrictive in other settings, such
as quasilinear preferences, social choice, and matching (Green and Laffont, 1977; Gibbard,
1973; Satterthwaite, 1975; Roth, 1982).
Second, our paper is related to the robust implementation literature. Robust implementation considers mechanisms where truthful reporting is robust to a broad set of beliefs
that the participants may have. For example, Bergemann and Morris (2005) consider direct
mechanisms where it is ex interim optimal to report truthfully for arbitrary beliefs. They
give conditions under which this notion of implementability is equivalent to ex post implementability, which is equivalent to dominant strategy implementability in the private values
case. SP-L requires truthful reporting to be optimal under a meaningfully broader set of
beliefs than in Bayesian implementation, but narrower than the set of beliefs allowed in the
robust mechanism design literature. Thus, the goal of SP-L is to retain some of the benefits of
robustness, while being less restrictive than robust and dominant strategies implementation.
Third, our paper uses approximations, which is an old idea in implementation theory.
In implementation theory, approximations are used in the literature on large markets (e.g.,
Hammond, 1979 as a response to Hurwicz, 1972), which we discussed above, and in the
literature on virtual implementation (Matsushima, 1988; Abreu and Sen, 1991; Abreu and
Matsushima, 1992). The literature on virtual implementation revisited full implementation
under classic solution concepts, but allowing for an approximate notion of implementation.
Namely, the social choice function F is virtually implementable if there exists a social choice
26

The issue of guaranteeing implementation under every equilibrium is central in the implementation theory
literature. In fact, Jackson (2001) p. 660 classifies the study of full implementation as “implementation
theory”, and the study of partial implementation and incentive compatibility as “mechanism design”.

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

function that is exactly implementable and whose outcomes are arbitrarily close to the outcomes of F , in a probabilistic sense. Virtual implementation differs from our approximation
because the virtual implementation approximation does not depend on market size, and is
for allocations and not for incentives. The main finding in this literature is that virtual implementation under many solution concepts, such as full Nash implementation, is extremely
permissive, with most social choice functions being implementable (Matsushima, 1988; Abreu
and Sen, 1991). In our setting, the approximation in the definition of SP-L also makes the
set of mechanisms that are SP-L considerably larger than the set of mechanism that are SP.
However, the notion of SP-L retains considerable bite, as many existing mechanisms are not
SP-L.
Strategy-proofness in Market Design Our paper is related to three strands of literature
on the role of strategy-proofness in market design. First, there is an empirical literature
that studies how participants behave in real-world non-SP market designs. One example is
Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2006), who show, in the context of the school choice system in Boston,
that sophisticated students strategically misreport their preferences, while unsophisticated
students frequently play dominated strategies; see Hwang (2014) and Agarwal and Somaini
(2014) for related studies. Another example is Budish and Cantillon (2012), who show that
students at Harvard Business School strategically misreport their preferences for courses,
often sub-optimally, and that this misreporting harms welfare relative to both truthful play
and optimal equilibrium behavior. We discussed this literature in more detail in Section
4.3. This literature supports the SP-L concept, because all of the examples in which there
is evidence of harm from misreporting involve mechanisms that not only are not SP, but are
not even SP-L.
Second, several recent papers in the market design literature have argued that strategyproofness can be viewed as a design objective and not just as a constraint. Papers on
this theme include Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2006), Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2009), Pathak and
Sönmez (2008), Roth (2008), Milgrom (2011) Section IV, Pathak and Sönmez (2013) and
Li (2015). The overall argument for SP market design traces to Wilson (1987). Our paper
contributes to this literature by showing that our notion of SP-L approximates the appeal
of SP, while at the same time being considerably less restrictive. Also, the distinction we
draw between mechanisms that are SP-L and mechanisms that are manipulable even in large
markets highlights that many mechanisms in practice are manipulable in a preventable way.
Last, our paper is closely conceptually related to Parkes et al. (2001), Day and Milgrom
(2008), Erdil and Klemperer (2010), and especially Pathak and Sönmez (2013). Each of

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

38

these papers – motivated, like us, by the restrictiveness of SP – proposes a method to compare the manipulability of non-SP mechanisms based on the magnitude of their violation
of SP. Parkes et al. (2001), Day and Milgrom (2008) and Erdil and Klemperer (2010) focus
on the setting of combinatorial auctions. They propose cardinal measures of a combinatorial auction’s manipulability based, respectively, on Euclidean distance from Vickrey prices,
the worst-case incentive to misreport, and marginal incentives to misreport. Each of these
papers then seeks to design a combinatorial auction that minimizes manipulability subject
to other design objectives. Pathak and Sönmez (2013), most similarly to us, use a general
mechanism design environment that encompasses a wide range of market design problems.
They propose the following partial order over non-SP mechanisms: mechanism ψ is said to
be more manipulable than mechanism ϕ if, for any problem instance where ϕ is manipulable by at least one agent, so too is ψ. This concept helps to explain several recent policy
decisions in which school authorities in Chicago and England switched from one non-SP
mechanism to another. This concept also yields an alternative formalization of Milton Friedman’s argument for uniform-price auctions over pay-as-bid auctions: whereas we show that
uniform-price auctions are SP-L and pay-as-bid auctions are not, Pathak and Sönmez (2013)
show that the pay-as-bid auction is more manipulable than the uniform-price auction according to their partial order. We view our approach as complementary to these alternative
approaches. Two important advantages of our approach are that it yields the classification
of non-SP mechanisms as displayed in Table 1, and yields an explicit second-best criterion
for designing new mechanisms, namely that they be SP-L.

Conclusion

A potential interpretation of our results is that they suggest that SP-L be viewed as a
necessary condition for good design in large anonymous and semi-anonymous settings. Our
criterion provides a common language for criticism of mechanisms ranging from Friedman’s
(1960) criticism of pay-as-bid auctions, to Roth’s (1990; 1991) criticism of priority-matching
mechanisms, to Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez’s (2003) criticism of the Boston mechanism
for school choice. The issue is not simply that these mechanisms are manipulable, but
that they are manipulable even in large markets; even the kinds of agents we think of as
“price takers” will want to misreport their preferences. The evidence we review in Section 4
suggests that manipulability in the large is a costly problem in practice, whereas the record
for SP-L mechanisms, though incomplete, is positive. Our result in Section 5 then indicates

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

39

that manipulability in the large can be avoided at approximately zero cost. Together, these
results suggest that using a mechanism that is manipulable in the large is a preventable
design mistake.
Whether SP-L can also be viewed as sufficient depends upon the extent to which the
large-market abstraction is compelling in the problem of interest. Unfortunately, even with
convergence rates such as those stated in Theorem 1, there rarely is a simple bright-line
answer to the question of “how large is large”.27 But – just as economists in other fields
instinctively understand that there are some contexts where it is necessary to explicitly
model strategic interactions, and other contexts where it may be reasonable to assume pricetaking behavior – we hope that market designers will pause to consider whether it is necessary
to restrict attention to SP mechanisms, or whether SP-L may be sufficient for the problem
at hand.

27

Even in theoretical analyses of the convergence properties of specific mechanisms, rarely is the analysis
sufficient to answer the question of, e.g., “is 1000 participants large?” Convergence is often slow or includes
a large constant term. A notable exception is double auctions. For instance, Rustichini et al. (1994) are
able to show, in a double auction with unit demand and uniformly distributed values, that 6 buyers and
sellers is large enough to approximate efficiency to within one percent. Of course, in any specific context,
the analyst’s case that the market is large can be strengthened with empirical or computational evidence;
see, for instance, Roth and Peranson (1999).

Appendix: Proofs

A.1

Proof of Theorem 1

We first define notation that will be used in the proof of Theorem 1. Given µ̂ ∈ ∆T , let
Φni (ti |µ̂) denote the bundle Φni (ti , t−i ), where t−i is an arbitrary vector of n − 1 types such
that emp[ti , t−i ] = µ̂, if such t−i exists.28 If there is no such t−i , which is the case for
example if µ̂(ti ) = 0, then Φni (ti |µ̂) is defined as the random bundle placing equal weight on
all outcomes in X0 . Note that bundles Φni (ti |µ̂) which do not correspond to any t−i do not
play any role in the results. They are defined only to simplify the notation in the proof below.
Let Pr{µ̂|t0i , µ, n} be the probability that the empirical distribution of (t0i , t−i ) is µ̂, given a
fixed t0i and that the vector t−i of n − 1 types is drawn i.i.d. according to µ. Throughout the
proof we consider sums over infinite sets, but where only a finite number of the summands
are nonzero. We adopt the convention that these are finite sums of only the positive terms.

Pr{µ̂|t0i , µ, n} · uti [Φni (t0i |µ̂)].

The interim gain from misreporting as type t0i instead of type ti equals

We can reorder the terms on the RHS of (A.1) as

That is, the gain from misreporting can be decomposed into two terms. The first term

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

is the expected gain, over all possible empirical distributions µ̂, of reporting t0i instead of
ti , holding fixed the empirical distribution of types. This quantity equals how much type ti
players envy type t0i players, in expectation. The second term is the sum, over all possible
empirical distributions µ̂, of how much changing the report from ti to t0i increases the likelihood of µ̂, times the utility of receiving the bundle given to a type t0i agent. That is, how
much player i gains by manipulating the expected empirical distribution of reports µ̂. Our
goal is to show that, if a mechanism is EF or EF-TB, then both of these terms are bounded
above in large markets.
The proof is based on two lemmas. The first lemma bounds the effect that a single player
can have on the probability distribution of the realized empirical distribution of types. This
will allow us to bound the second term in expression (A.2).
Lemma A.1. Define, given types ti and t0i , distribution of types µ ∈ ∆T , and market size
n, the function
∆P (ti , t0i , µ, n) =

X

| Pr{µ̂|t0i , µ, n} − Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n}|.

(A.3)

µ̂∈∆T

¯ , and  > 0, there exists a constant C∆P > 0 such that, for any ti , t0i
Then, for any µ ∈ ∆T
and n we have
∆P (ti , t0i , µ, n) ≤ C∆P · n−1/2+ .
The second lemma will help us bound the first term in expression (A.2). Note that this
term is always weakly negative for EF mechanisms, by definition, but that it can be positive
for EF-TB mechanisms. The lemma provides a bound on the maximum amount of envy in
an EF-TB mechanism, based on the minimum number of agents of a given type.
Lemma A.2. Fix an EF-TB mechanism {(Φn )N , T }. Define, given types ti and t0i , empirical
distribution of types µ̂ ∈ ∆T , and market size n, the function
E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) = uti [Φni (t0i |µ̂)] − uti [Φni (ti |µ̂)],
which measures the envy of ti for t0i . Then, for any  > 0, there exists CE such that, for all
¯ such that µ̂ corresponds to the empirical distribution of types for
ti , t0 ∈ T , n, and µ̂ ∈ ∆T
i

some vector in T n , we have
E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) ≤ CE · min{µ̂(τ ) · n}−1/4+ .
τ ∈T

(A.4)

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

The proofs of Lemmas A.1 and A.2 are given below. We now use the two lemmas to
prove Theorem 1
Proof of Theorem 1, Case 1: EF mechanisms. Applying the notation of Lemmas A.1 and
A.2 to the terms in equation (A.2), and recalling that utility is bounded above by 1, we
obtain the bound
uti [φni (t0i , µ)] − uti [φni (ti , µ)] ≤

(A.5)

µ̂∈∆T

+∆P (ti , t0i , µ, n).
If a mechanism is EF and µ̂(t0i ) > 0, i.e., the empirical µ̂ has at least one report of t0i ,
then the first term in the RHS of inequality (A.5) is nonpositive. Taking any  > 0, and
using Lemma A.1 to bound the ∆P term in the RHS of inequality (A.5) we have that there
exists C∆P > 0 such that
uti [φni (t0i , µ)] − uti [φni (ti , µ)] ≤ Pr{µ̂(t0i ) = 0|ti , µ, n}

(A.6)

+C∆P · n−1/2+ .
Since the probability that µ̂(t0i ) = 0 goes to 0 exponentially with n, we have the desired
result.

Proof of Theorem 1, Case 2: EF-TB mechanisms. We begin by bounding the envy term in
inequality (A.5), which is weakly negative for EF mechanisms but can be strictly positive in
EF-TB mechanisms. We can, for any δ ≥ 0, decompose the envy term as
X

X

Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} · E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) =

Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} · E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) (A.7)

Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} · E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n).

µ̂:minτ µ̂(τ )<µ(τ )−δ

By Lemma A.2, for any  > 0 there exists a constant CE such that
X

Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} · E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) ≤ CE · min{(µ(τ ) − δ)n}−1/4+ .
τ ∈T

(A.8)

µ̂:minτ µ̂(τ )≥µ(τ )−δ

To bound the second term in the RHS of A.7, begin by noting that µ̂(τ ) · n equals the
number of agents who draw type τ . This number is the outcome of n − 1 i.i.d. draws of

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

50

agents different than i, plus 1 if ti = τ . Using Hoeffding’s inequality, for any τ , we can bound
the probability that the realized value of µ̂(τ ) · n is much smaller than µ(τ ) · n. We have
that, for any δ > 0, there exists a constant Cδ,µ > 0 such that29
Pr{µ̂(τ ) · n < (µ(τ ) − δ) · n|ti , µ, n} ≤ Cδ,µ · exp{−2δ 2 n}.

(A.9)

Take now δ = minτ ∈T µ(τ )/2. Applying the bounds (A.8) and (A.9) to inequality (A.7), we
have that
X

Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} · E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) ≤ CE · min{(µ(τ ) − δ)n}−1/4+
τ ∈T

µ̂∈∆T

+|T | · Cδ,µ · exp{−2δ 2 n}.
Multiplying n out of the first term in the RHS then yields
X

Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} · E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) ≤ CE · min{µ(τ ) − δ}−1/4+ · n−1/4+
τ ∈T

µ̂∈∆T

+|T | · Cδ,µ · exp{−2δ 2 n}.
Therefore, there exists a constant C 0 such that for all n, t0i , and ti ,
X

Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} · E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n) ≤ C 0 · n−1/4+ .

µ̂∈∆T

Return now to inequality (A.5). Using the bound we just derived and Lemma A.1, we
have that there exists a constant C∆P such that
uti [φni (t0i , µ)] − uti [φni (ti , µ)] ≤ C 0 · n−1/4+
+C∆P · n−1/2+ .
Therefore, there exists a constant C 00 such that
uti [φni (t0i , µ)] − uti [φni (ti , µ)] ≤ C 00 · n−1/4+ ,
29

Hoeffding’s inequality states that, given n i.i.d. binomial random variables with probability of success p,
and z > 0, the probability of having fewer than (p − z)n successes is bounded above by exp{−2z 2 n}. Note
that, in the bound below, ti is fixed, while the n − 1 coordinates of t−i are drawn i.i.d. according to µ. For
that reason, the Hoeffding bound must be modified to include a constant that depends on δ and µ, which
we denote Cδ,µ . The reason why a constant suffices is that, conditional on δ and µ, the bound taking into
account the n − 1 draws converges to 0 at the same rate as the bound considering n draws.

as desired.

A.1.1

Proof of the Lemmas

We now prove the lemmas. Throughout the proofs, we consider the case  < 1/4, which
implies the results for  ≥ 1/4.
Proof of Lemma A.1. To show that a single player cannot appreciably affect the distribution
of µ̂, we start by calculating the effect of changing i’s report on the probability of an individual
value of µ̂ being drawn. Consider any µ̂ that is the empirical distribution of some vector of
types with n agents.
Enumerate the elements of T as
T = {τ1 , τ2 , · · · τ|T | }.
Since µ̂ follows a multinomial distribution, for any ti ∈ T , the probability Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n}
equals



n−1
· µ(τ1 )nµ̂(τ1 ) · · · µ(ti )nµ̂(ti )−1 · · · µ(τ|T | )nµ̂(τ|T | ) ,
nµ̂(τ1 ), · · · , nµ̂(ti ) − 1, · · · , nµ̂(τ|T | )

where the term in parentheses is a multinomial coefficient. Note that the nµ̂(τ ) terms in this
expression are integers, since this is the number of agents with a given type in a realization
µ̂ of the distribution of types. Moreover, ti only enters the formula in one factorial term in
the denominator, and a power term in the numerator. With this observation, we have that
Pr{µ̂|t0i , µ, n}/ Pr{µ̂|ti , µ, n} =

µ̂(t0i ) µ̂(ti )
/
.
µ(t0i ) µ(ti )

(A.10)

For the rest of the proof, we will consider separately values of µ̂ which are close to µ, and
those that are very different from µ. We will show that player i can only have a small effect
on the probability of the former, while the latter occur with very small probability.
We derive bounds as functions of a variable δ. Initially, we derive bounds valid for any
δ > 0, and, later in the proof, we consider the case where δ is a particular function of n.
Define, for any δ > 0, the set Mδ of empirical distributions µ̂ that are sufficiently close to
the true distribution µ as
Mδ = {µ̂ ∈ ∆T : |µ̂(ti ) − µ(ti )| < δ and |µ̂(t0i ) − µ(t0i )| < δ}.

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

52

Note that, when µ̂(ti ) = µ(ti ) and µ̂(t0i ) = µ(t0i ), the ratio on the right of equation (A.10)
equals 1 and is continuously differentiable in µ̂(ti ) and µ̂(t0i ). Consequently, there exists a
constant C > 0, and δ̄ > 0 such that, for all δ ≤ δ̄, if µ̂ ∈ Mδ then
|

µ̂(t0i ) µ̂(ti )

− 1| < Cδ.
µ(t0i ) µ(ti )

(A.11)

Moreover, we can bound the probability that the empirical distribution of types µ̂ is not in
Mδ+ 1 . By Hoeffding’s inequality,30 for any δ > 0 and n,
n

terms where µ̂ is within or outside Mδ+ 1 . We then have

second term to converge to 0, asymptotically δ has to be greater than n−1/2 . If we take
δ = n−1/2+ , we obtain the bound

Figure A.1: A scatter plot of the lottery numbers li0 of different agents i0 on the horizontal
axis, and the utility uti [xni0 (t, l)] of type ti agents from the bundles i0 receives in the vertical

consistent with EF-TB, as the utilities of type ti agents are always above the utilities from
bundles of any agent with lower lottery number.
fore, we can find a constant C∆P such that
∆P ≤ C∆P · n−1/2+ ,
completing the proof.

We now prove Lemma A.2. The result would follow immediately if we restricted attention
to mechanisms that are EF. The difficulty in establishing the result is that mechanisms that
are EF-TB but not EF can have large amounts of envy ex-post, i.e., uti [Φnj (t)] − uti [Φni (t)]
can be large. To see why this can be the case, fix two players i and j and consider Figure
A.1. The figure plots, for several players i0 whose types are either ti0 = ti or ti0 = tj , lottery
numbers li0 in the horizontal axis and the utility of a type ti for the bundle i0 receives in the
vertical axis. Players with ti0 = ti are plotted as balls, and players with ti0 = tj as triangles.
Note that the figure is consistent with EF-TB. In particular, if lj ≤ li , then player i prefers
his own bundle to player j’s bundle. However, if player j received a higher lottery number,
lj > li , it is perfectly consistent with EF-TB that player i prefers player j’s bundle. That is,
a player corresponding to a ball may envy a player corresponding to a triangle in the picture,
as long as the triangle player has a higher lottery number. In fact, player i can envy player
j by a large amount, so EF-TB mechanisms can have a lot of envy ex-post.
Figure A.1 also suggests a way to prove the lemma, despite this difficulty. The proof

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

55

exploits two basic insights. First, note that the curve formed by the balls – the utility player
i derives from the bundles assigned to the type ti players – is always above the curve formed
by the triangles – the utility player i derives from the bundles assigned to the type tj players.
Hence, for type ti agents to, on average, have a large amount of ex-post envy of type tj agents,
the lottery outcome must be very uneven, favoring type tj players over type ti players. We
can bound this average ex-post envy as a function of how well distributed lottery numbers
are (see Claim A.1). Second, due to symmetry, how much player i envies player j ex-ante
(i.e., before the lottery) equals how much player i prefers the bundles received by type tj
players over the bundles received by type ti players, averaging over all type ti and tj players,
and all possible lottery draws. Since lottery draws are likely to be very evenly distributed
in a large market, it follows that player i’s envy with respect to player j, before the lottery
draw, is small (see Claim A.2). We now formalize these ideas.
Proof of Lemma A.2. The proof of the lemma has three steps. The first step bounds how
much players of a given type envy players of another type, on average, conditional on a
vector of reports t and lottery draw l, as a function of how evenly distributed the lottery
numbers are. The second step bounds envy between two players, conditional on a vector of
reports t, but before the lottery is drawn. Finally, the third step uses these bounds to prove
the result.
Step 1. Bounding average envy after a lottery draw.
We begin by defining a measure of how evenly distributed a vector of lottery numbers is.
Fix a market size n, vector of types t ∈ T n , vector of lottery draws l and players i and j.
Partition the set of players in groups according to where their lottery number falls among
K uniformly-spaced intervals L1 = [0, 1/K), L2 = [1/K, 2/K), · · · , LK = [(K − 1)/K, 1].
Denote the set of all type ti0 players by
I(i0 |t) = {i00 : ti00 = ti0 },
and denote the set of type ti0 players with lottery numbers in Lk by
Ik (i0 |t, l) = {i00 ∈ I(i0 |t) : li00 ∈ Lk }.
When there is no risk of confusion, these sets will be denoted by I(i0 ) and Ik (i0 ), respectively. The number of elements in a set of players I(i0 ) is denoted by |I(i0 )|.
Given the lottery draw l, we choose the number of partitions K(l, t, i, j) such that the
type ti and type tj players’ lottery numbers are not too unevenly distributed over the Lk sets.

AZEVEDO AND BUDISH

Specifically, let K(l, t, i, j) be the largest integer K such that, for i0 = i, j, and k = 1, · · · , K,

Such an integer necessarily exists, as K = 1 satisfies this condition. Intuitively, the larger is
K(l, t, i, j), the more evenly distributed the lottery numbers l are. When there is no risk of
confusion, we write K(l) or K for K(l, t, i, j).
The following claim bounds the average envy of type ti players towards type tj players,
after a lottery draw, as a function of K(l, t, i, j).
Claim A.1. Fix a market size n, vector of types t ∈ T n , lottery draws l ∈ [0, 1]n , and players
i and j. Then the average envy of type ti players towards type tj players is bounded by

Proof. Denote the minimum utility received by a player with type ti and lottery number in
Lk as
vk (l) = min{uti [xni0 (t, l)] : i0 ∈ Ik (i)}.
Define vK(l)+1 (l) = 1. Although vk (l) and K(l) depend on l, we will omit this dependence
when there is no risk of confusion. Note that, by the EF-TB condition, for all j 0 ∈ Ik (j),
uti [xnj0 (t, l)] ≤ vk+1 .

(A.17)

vk+1 ≤ uti [xni0 (t, l)].

(A.18)

Moreover, for all i0 ∈ Ik+1 (i),

We now bound the average utility a type ti agent derives from the bundles received by
all players with type tj as follows.

The second line follows from breaking the sum over the K sets Ik (j), and the third line

as per inequality (A.15). The inequality in the third line follows from

Since we started from inequality (A.19), the bound (A.16) follows, completing the proof.

Step 2: Bounding envy before the lottery draw.
We now bound the envy between two players i and j given a profile of types t, before the
lottery is drawn.
Claim A.2. Given  > 0, there exists a constant CE > 0 such that, for any t ∈ T n and

i, j ≤ n, player i’s envy with respect to player j is bounded by

Proof. Given a vector of types t and a player i0 , using anonymity, we can write the expected
bundle Φni0 (t) received by player i0 as the expected bundle received by all players with the
same type, over all realizations of l:

We need to show that, on average over all lottery realizations, K(l) is large enough such
that the integral above is small. Given a lottery draw l denote by F̂i0 (x|l) the fraction of
agents in I(i0 ) with lottery number no greater than x. Formally,
F̂i0 (x|l) = |{i00 ∈ I(i0 ) : li00 ≤ x}|/|I(i0 )|.
That is, F̂i0 is the empirical distribution function of the lottery draws of type ti0 agents. Since
the lottery numbers are i.i.d., we know that the F̂i0 (x|l) functions are very likely to be close
to the actual distribution of lottery draws F (x) = x. By the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz
inequality, for any δ > 0,
Pr{sup |F̂i0 (x|l) − x| > δ} ≤ 2 exp(−2|I(i0 )|δ 2 ).

Consider now an arbitrary integer K̄ > 0. Note that the probability that K(l) ≥ K̄ is at

by construction is the largest integer that satisfies these conditions. Therefore,
Pr{K(l) < K̄} ≤ 2K̄[exp(−|I(i)|/2K̄ 4 ) + exp(−|I(j)|/2K̄ 4 )]
≤ 4K̄ exp(− min

Using this, we can bound the integral in the right side of equation (A.22). Note that the
integrand 3/K(l) is decreasing in K(l), and attains its maximum value of 3 when K(l) = 1.
Therefore, the integral in equation (A.22) can be bounded by

Step 3: Completing the proof.
The lemma now follows from Claim A.2. Take  > 0, and consider a constant CE as in
the statement of Claim A.2. Consider ti , t0i , µ̂, and n as in the statement of the lemma.
¯ , we have µ̂(τ ) > 0 for all τ ∈ T . Additionally, since µ̂ equals the
Recall that, since µ̂ ∈ ∆T
empirical distribution of some vector of types, there exists t−i and j such that µ̂ = emp[t]
and tj = t0i . Therefore, we have

The first equation is the definition of E(ti , t0i , µ̂, n). The equation in the second line follows
from the way we defined t. The inequality in the third line follows from Claim A.2. The
final inequality follows because mini0 =i,j {|I(i|t)|} is weakly greater than minτ ∈T {µ̂(τ ) · n}.

Infinite Set of Bundles

We close this Section by highlighting that the assumption of a finite set of bundles X0 is not
necessary for Theorem 1.
Remark 1. For the proof of Theorem 1 and Lemmas A.1 and A.2, we do not have to assume
X0 finite. The proofs follow verbatim with the following assumptions. X0 is a measurable
subset of Euclidean space. Agents’ utility functions over X0 are measurable and have range
[−∞, 1]. The utility of reporting truthfully is at least 0. That is, for all n and t ∈ T n ,
uti [Φni (t)] ≥ 0.
The theorem holds with otherwise arbitrary X0 satisfying these assumptions. The added
generality is important for classifying the Walrasian mechanism in Appendix C.1.4.
mini0 =i,j {|I(i0 )|}4 grows much more quickly than log mini0 =i,j {|I(i0 )|}.

F n (ω) = Φn (σ ∗ (ω))
for all n and vectors of n types ω in Ω∗n . Define the direct mechanism ((Ψn )n∈N , T ) by
Ψn (t) = Φn (σ ∗ ((t1 , emp[t]), . . . , (tn , emp[t]))).
Denote by ψ n (ti , µ) the bundle a participant who reports ti expects to receive from Ψn if the
other participants report i.i.d. according to µ.

By the definition of f n and the fact that σ ∗ is a limit Bayes-Nash equilibrium, there exists

Moreover, by step 1 of this proof, we can take n0 such that the second and third terms are
bounded above by /3. This implies inequality (A.26).

A.3

Proof of Corollary 1

In this section, we denote the Boston mechanism by ((Φ)n∈N , S). The corollary uses some
facts about limit equilibria of the boston mechanism given a common identically independently distributed prior over payoff types. Let Σ∗ (µ) denote the set of limit equilibria of
the Boston mechanism given a prior µ in ∆T . Formally, denote by Σ∗∗ be the set of limit

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

63

Bayes-Nash equilibria of the Boston mechanism in the type space Ω∗ . Then we define
Σ∗ (µ) = {ρ ∈ RT+×S : ∃σ ∗ ∈ Σ∗∗ such that ρ(s, ti ) = σ ∗ (s, (ti , µ)) for all s ∈ S, ti ∈ T }.
That is, each element ρ of Σ∗ (µ) specifies the probability ρ(s, ti ) with which type ti agents
play action s in a limit equilibrium of the game with a common identically idenpendently
distributed prior µ over payoff types. In other words, ρ is an equilibrium strategy profile
of the Boston mechanism with set of types T and a common iid prior µ. Let P ∗ (µ) be the
set of vectors of probability of acceptance to each school in equilibrium. We then have the
following result:

Proposition 1. The correspondence Σ∗ (µ) is non- empty, convex-valued and continuous in
¯ . The correspondence P ∗ (µ) is non-empty, single-valued, and continuous in ∆T
¯ .
∆T

The Proposition shows that, given a prior µ, the Boston mechanism may have multiple
equilibria. Nevertheless, the probability of acceptance to each school is the same in any
equilibrium. The intuition is that lowering the probability of acceptance to a school weakly
reduces the set of students who want to point to it, and weakly increases the set of students
who want to point to other schools. Therefore, an argument similar to uniqueness arguments in competitive markets with gross substitutes shows that equilibrium probabilities
of acceptance are unique. Moreover, equilibrium delivers well-behaved outcomes because
probabilities of acceptance vary continuously.
Before proving the Proposition, we use it to establish Corollary 1.
Proposition 1 implies that Σ∗ is non-empty, lower hemi-continuous, and convex-valued.
The Michael Selection Theorem implies that Σ∗ has a continuous selection. Thus, there exists
a limit Bayes Nash equilibrium σ ∗ of the Boston mechanism defined over the type space Ω∗ ,
¯ . Because outcomes
and moreover this equilibrium σ ∗ (ti , µ) varies continuously with µ in ∆T
of the Boston mechanism vary continuously with the empirical distribution of types, the
social choice function (F n )n∈N defined by
F n (ω) = Φn (σ ∗ (ω))
is continuous and limit Bayes-Nash implementable. Corollary 1 then follows from Theorem
2.

Proof of Proposition 1

The Boston mechanism has a limit

Therefore, a strategy profile ρ∗ is in Σ∗ (µ) if and only if, for all ti and t0i in T ,
uti [φ∞ (ρ∗ (t0i ), ρ∗ (µ))] ≤ uti [φ∞ (ρ∗ (ti ), ρ∗ (µ))].
In that case, we say that ρ∗ is a limit Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the Boston mechanism
given µ. Given a prior µ and strategy profile ρ, denote by ρ(µ) the induced distribution over
actions.
We establish the Proposition in a series of claims.
Claim A.3. The correspondence Σ∗ is non-empty and upper hemi-continuous.
Proof. Payoffs
uti [φ∞ (ρ(ti ), ρ(µ))]
vary continuously with σ and µ. Therefore, Σ∗ is non-empty and upper hemi-continuous
(see Fudenberg and Tirole (1991) p. 30).
Claim A.4. For a fixed µ ∈ ∆T , the probabilities of acceptance to each school are the same
in any limit Bayes Nash equilibrium.
Proof. Consider an equilibrium ρ. Let the mass of students pointing to school s in this
equilibrium be
ms =

and let the probability of acceptance at school s be ps . Let the vectors p = (ps )s∈S and
m = (ms )s∈S . To establish the result, consider another equilibrium ρ0 , with associated
vectors of the mass of students pointing to each school m0 and probabilities of acceptance
p0 . Define the set of schools for which ps > p0s as S + and the set of schools for which ps < p0s
as S − .
Consider now the types who, in the equilibrium ρ, choose a school in S + with positive
probability. All agents with types in

Consider the types who choose a school in S + in the equilibrium ρ0 . Note that the probability

S + . Similarly, the probability of obtaining entry to any school not in S + is weakly higher.
Therefore, in the equilibrium ρ0 , only agents in T + possibly choose a school in S + with
positive probability. That is,

However, for any s ∈ S + we have
ms < m0s ,
because ps > p0s , and because probabilities of acceptance are determined by the mass of
students pointing to each school. Taken together, these equations imply that S + = ∅.
Analogously, we can prove that S − = ∅, so p = p0 as desired.
Claim A.5. P ∗ is non-empty, single-valued, and continuous.
Proof. The previous claims show that P ∗ is non-empty and single-valued. Moreover, P ∗ is
upper hemi-continuous, because Σ∗ is upper hemi-continuous and probabilities of acceptance
depend continuously on equilibrium strategies and the distribution of types. Finally, P ∗ is
continuous because continuity is equivalent to upper hemi-continuity for single-valued and
non-empty correspondences.
Claim A.6. Σ∗ is convex-valued.
Proof. Fix µ, and consider two equilibria ρ and ρ0 , and let ρ̄ be a convex combination of
ρ and ρ0 . We must show that the strategy profile ρ̄ is an equilibrium. By Claim A.4, the
probability of acceptance to each school is the same under ρ and ρ0 . Therefore, the probability

of acceptance is the same under ρ̄. Because the support of ρ̄ is contained in the union of the
supports of ρ and ρ0 , all types play optimally under ρ̄.

Claim A.7. Consider a prior µ0 ∈ ∆T
and s0 , we have ρ0 (ti )(s0 ) > 0. Then there exists a neighborhood of µ0 such that, for all µ
in this neighborhood, school s0 is optimal for ti given P ∗ (µ). That is, for any s ∈ S,
Ps∗0 (µ) · uti (s0 ) ≥ Ps∗ (µ) · uti (s).
Proof. To reach a contradiction, assume that this is not the case for some type t0i and school
s0 . Then there exists a school s1 and sequence of priors (µk )k∈N converging to µ0 such that,
for all k,
Ps∗0 (µk ) · ut0i (s0 ) < Ps∗1 (µk ) · ut0i (s1 ).

(A.27)

Denote the mass of t0i types originally pointing to school s0 as the strictly positive constant
C = ρ0 (t0i )(s0 ) · µ0 (t0i ).
Denote the relative increase in probability of acceptance at school s from prior µ0 to prior
µk by rs (µk ) = Ps∗ (µk )/Ps∗ (µ0 ). We can assume, passing to a subsequence if necessary, that
the ordering of schools according to rs (µk ) is the same for all k. Denote the schools where
the probability of acceptance increases relatively more than at school s0 as
S + = {s : rs (µk ) > rs0 (µk )}.
Let ρk be an equilibrium associated with µk . The mass of students pointing to schools
in S + under ρk minus the mass of students pointing to schools in S + under ρ0 equals

Students who point to schools in S + under ρ0 continue to do so under ρk . And, because

STRATEGY-PROOFNESS IN THE LARGE

67

equation (A.27) holds, the mass of students who point to schools in S\S + under ρ0 but who
point to schools in S + under ρk is at least C. Hence, the first term in expression (A.28) is
bounded below by C. Moreover, the second term converges to 0, because µk converges to
µ0 . Therefore, for large enough k, the mass of students pointing to schools in S + under ρk
is strictly larger than the mass of students pointing to schools in S + under ρ0 .
This implies that there exists a school s+ ∈ S + such that the mass of students pointing to
s+ is strictly greater under ρk than under ρ0 . And there exists a school s− ∈ S\S + such that
the mass of students pointing to s− is strictly smaller under ρk than under ρ0 . However, from
the way we constructed S + we have that rs+ (µk ) > rs− (µk ), which is a contradiction.
Claim A.8. Consider a prior µ0 , and associated equilibrium ρ0 such that, for some ti and
school s0 , the mass of students pointing to s0 is strictly lower than its capacity:
X

ρ0 (ti )(s0 ) · µ0 (ti ) < qs0 .

Then there exists a neighborhood of µ0 such that, for all µ in this neighborhood, Ps∗0 (µ) = 1.
Proof. Denote the excess supply of school s0 as the strictly positive constant
C = qs0 −

X

ρ0 (ti )(s0 ) · µ0 (ti ).

ti ∈T

To reach a contradiction, assume that the claim’s conclusion does not hold. Then there
exists a sequence of priors (µk )k∈N converging to µ0 such that, for all k, Ps∗0 (µk ) < 1. Let ρk
be an equilibrium given µk . The fact that the probability of acceptance at s0 is lower than
1 under ρk implies that the difference between the mass of students pointing to s0 under ρk
and ρ0 is bounded below by C. That is,
X

ρk (ti )(s0 ) · µk (ti ) −

ρ0 (ti )(s0 ) · µ0 (ti ) > C.

Because µk converges to µ0 , this implies that, for large enough k,
X

(ρk (ti )(s0 ) − ρ0 (ti )(s0 )) · µ0 (ti ) > C/2.

(A.29)

ti ∈T

As in the previous claim’s proof, denote the relative increase in the probability of acceptance at school s from prior µ0 to prior µk by rs (µk ) = Ps∗ (µk )/Ps∗ (µ0 ). We can assume,
passing to a subsequence if necessary, that the ordering of schools according to rs (µk ) is the

same for all k. Denote the set of schools where the relative probability of acceptance does
not increase more than in s0 by
S − = {s : rs (µk ) ≤ rs0 (µ0 )}\{s0 }.
All students who point to a school in S − ∪ {s0 } under ρk point to schools in S − ∪ {s0 }
under ρ0 . Thus,
X

(ρk (ti )(s) − ρ0 (ti )(s)) · µ0 (ti ) ≤ 0.

s∈S − ∪{s0 },ti ∈T

Substituting inequality (A.29) we have that, for large enough k,
X

(ρk (ti )(s) − ρ0 (ti )(s)) · µ0 (ti ) < −C/2.

(A.30)

s∈S − ,ti ∈T

The mass of students pointing to schools in S − under ρk minus the mass of students

By inequality (A.30), for large enough k, the first term in the expression above is smaller
than −C/2. Because the second term converges to 0, we have that, for sufficiently large k,
the mass of students pointing to schools in S − under ρk is strictly lower than the mass of
students pointing to schools in S − under ρ0 . Hence, for at least one school s− in S − , we
have rs− (µk ) ≥ 1. But this contradicts rs− (µk ) ≤ rs0 (µk ) < 1.

Claim A.9. The correspondence Σ∗ is lower hemi-continuous in ∆T
Proof. To prove lower hemi-continuity, fix µ0 , an associated limit equilibrium ρ0 , and consider
a sequence (µk )k≥1 converging to µ0 . Fix  > 0. We will show that there exists a sequence of
equilibria (ρk )k≥1 , associated with the µk , which converges to a strategy profile with distance

Part 1: Define the candidate sequence of equilibria.
Let ρ0k be an equilibrium associated with µk . Passing to a subsequence, we can assume

Note that this sequence converges to  · ρ00 + (1 − ) · ρ0 . Hence, it converges to a point within

Part 2: For large enough k, ρk is a strategy profile.
P
Because the sum s ρk (ti )(s) = 1, we only have to demonstrate that every ρk (ti )(s) is
nonnegative. To see this, note that ρk converges to  · ρ00 + (1 − ) · ρ0 . Hence, if either
ρ0 (ti )(s) > 0 or ρ00 (ti )(s) > 0, then ρk (ti )(s) > 0 for sufficiently large k. The remaining case
is when ρ0 (ti )(s) = ρ00 (ti )(s) = 0. In this case we have that ρk (ti )(s) = ρ0k (ti )(s) ≥ 0.
Part 3: For sufficiently large k, the ρk are equilibria.
We will begin by proving that, for sufficiently large k, the probabilities of acceptance
under ρk equal those under ρ0k . That is, the probabilities of acceptance under ρk equal
P ∗ (µk ). To see this, note that the mass of agents pointing to school s under ρk equals

There are two cases. The first case is when the mass of students pointing to s is strictly
lower than qs under either ρ0 or ρ00 . In this case, we have Ps∗ (µ0 ) = 1, so that, in the mass
of students pointing to s is at most equal to qs under both ρ00 and ρ0 . The mass of students
pointing to school s under ρk converges to

That is, to an average of the mass of students pointing to s under ρ00 and ρ0 . Because both
quantities are weakly smaller than qs , and at least one of them is strictly lower than qs , this
average is strictly lower than qs . Thus, for large enough k, the probability of acceptance to
s under ρk is 1. This is equal to the probability of acceptance under ρ0k , by Claim A.8.
The second case is when the mass of students pointing to school s is at least equal to qs
both under ρ0 and under ρ00 . If this is the case, then the mass of students pointing to school
s is the same under ρ0 and under ρ00 , because probabilities of acceptance are the same in any

Substituting this in Equation (A.31), we have that the probabilities of acceptance under ρk
and ρ0k are equal, as desired.
To complete the proof we show that, for large enough k, the strategies ρk are optimal
given P ∗ (µk ). Consider a school s with ρk (ti )(s) > 0. Therefore, either ρ0k (ti )(s) > 0 or
ρ0 (ti )(s) > 0. If ρ0k (ti )(s) > 0, then it is optimal for type ti to point to s under P ∗ (µk ),
because ρ0k is an equilibrium. Likewise, if ρ0 (ti )(s) > 0, then Claim A.7 implies that, for
large enough k, it is optimal for type ti to report s under P ∗ (µk ).
The proposition then follows from Claims A.3, A.5, and A.9.
