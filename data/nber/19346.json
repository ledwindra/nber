I empirically identify the differential effect of the generosity of the welfare state on the skill composition of immigrants across the two groups (the \"free-migration\" group and the \"policy-restricted migration\" group) in an unbiased way. 3. I outline the implications of the tax burden of migration to tax competition within a union, facing migration from the rest of the world.Each host country in a competitive regime balances on the margin these gains and losses from migration. In doing so, each country takes the well-being of the migrants as given.  Therefore, It ignores the fact that a tax-migration policy that admits an extra migrant raises the well-being that must be accorded to migrants by all the other host countries, in order to elicit the migrant to come in; and more capital income leaks, through capital  taxation, to immigrants.\n\n",
