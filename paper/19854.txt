ABSTRACT
We provide a theory of the determination of exchange rates based on capital flows in imperfect financial
markets. Capital flows drive exchange rates by altering the balance sheets of financiers that bear the
risks resulting from international imbalances in the demand for financial assets. Such alterations to
their balance sheets cause financiers to change their required compensation for holding currency risk,
thus impacting both the level and volatility of exchange rates. Our theory of exchange rate determination
in imperfect financial markets not only helps rationalize the empirical disconnect between exchange
rates and traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, but also has real consequences for output and risk
sharing. Exchange rates are sensitive to imbalances in financial markets and seldom perform the shock
absorption role that is central to traditional theoretical macroeconomic analysis. Our framework is
flexible; it accommodates a number of important modeling features within an imperfect financial market
model, such as non-tradables, production, money, sticky prices or wages, various forms of international
pricing-to-market, and unemployment.

I NTRODUCTION

We provide a theory of exchange rate determination based on capital flows in imperfect financial
markets. In our model, exchange rates are governed by financial forces because global shifts in the
demand and supply of assets result in large scale capital flows that are intermediated by the global
financial system. The demand and supply of assets in different currencies and the willingness of the
financial system to absorb the resulting imbalances are first order determinants of exchange rates.
Despite extensive debates on these financial forces and their implications for exchange rates, there
are very few tractable frameworks to provide a unified analysis of such phenomena.
Active risk taking in currency markets is highly concentrated in few large financial players.1
These institutions range from the (former) proprietary desks and investment management arms of
global investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, to macro and currency hedge funds
such as Soros Fund Management, to active investment managers and pension funds such as PIMCO
and BlackRock. While there are certainly significant differences across these intermediaries, we stress
their common characteristic of being active investors that profit from medium-term imbalances in
international financial markets, often by bearing the risks (taking the other side) resulting from imbalances in currency demand due to both trade and financial flows. They also share the characteristic
of being subject to financial constraints that limit their ability to take positions, based on their riskbearing capacities and existing balance sheet risks.
Our model captures this element of reality by placing financiers at the core of exchange rate determination. In our model, financiers absorb a portion of the currency risk originated by imbalanced
global capital flows. Alterations to the size and composition of financiers’ balance sheets induce
them to differentially price currency risk, thus affecting both the level and the volatility of exchange
rates. Our theory of exchange rate determination in imperfect financial markets differs from conventional open macroeconomic model by introducing financial forces, such as portfolio flows, financiers’
balance sheets and risk-bearing capacity, as first order determinants of exchange rates.
1 Detailed data on risk taking in this international and opaque over-the-counter market are relatively scarce, particularly
since a number of players, such as hedge funds, have low reporting requirements. It is precisely this nature of the market
that favors specialization and concentration. Transaction volume data, however, also portray a highly concentrated market.
The top 10 banks accounted for 80% of all flows in 2014, with the top two banks (Citigroup and Deutsche Bank) accounting
for 32% of all flows (Euromoney (2014)). Not only are these institutions large players in currency markets, currency risk also
accounts for a large fraction of their overall respective risk taking. Regulatory filings reveal that currency risk accounted
for 26% to 35% of total (Stressed) Value at Risk at Deutsche Bank in 2013 and between 17% and 23% at Citigroup in the
same period (Deutsche Bank (2013); Citigroup (2013)).

A number of stylized facts have emerged from the empirical analysis of international financial
markets: the failure of the uncovered interest parity condition (UIP) and the associated profitable
carry trade, the presence of large-scale global (gross) capital flows putting appreciation pressure on
the currencies of inflow-recipient countries, the disconnect of exchange rates from macro fundamentals, the vulnerability of external-debtor countries’ currencies to global financial shocks, and the impact of large scale currency interventions by governments. At the same time the global financial crisis
has highlighted the importance of financial frictions not only for outcomes in financial markets but
also for real outcomes such as output and risk sharing. The main purpose of this paper is to provide
a tractable framework to both jointly analyze these issues (some classic, some new) and to provide a
number of new insights.
Financiers actively trade currencies but have limited risk-bearing capacity: in equilibrium, a
global imbalance that requires financiers to be long a currency generates an increase in the expected
return of this currency. This has to occur to provide incentives to financiers to use part of their limited
risk-bearing capacity to absorb the imbalance. All else equal, the currency has to depreciate today
and be expected to appreciate in the future in order for financiers to earn compensation for their risk
taking. This is the central exchange rate determination mechanism in the model.
Based on this framework, we analyze the importance of capital flows, i.e. demand for foreigncurrency-denominated assets, in directly determining exchange rates. Whenever they are not matched
globally, these global flows generate an imbalance and, via the constraints of the financiers, a direct
effect on both the level and dynamics of the exchange rate. Consequently, countries that have recently received capital inflows tend to have risky currencies that depreciate if financiers’ risk-bearing
capacity is disrupted. Since these countries have borrowed from financiers, their currencies in equilibrium have high expected returns in order to incentivize financiers to lend. A financial disruption,
by reducing financiers’ risk-bearing capacity, generates an immediate currency depreciation and an
expectation of further future currency appreciation in order to increase financiers’ incentive to sustain
the imbalance.
The model accounts for the failure of the UIP and provides a financial view of the carry trade
whereby the trade performs poorly whenever adverse shocks to the financial system occur. UIP is
violated because the financiers’ limited risk-bearing capacity induces them to demand a currency
risk premium. In this world the carry trade is profitable because, given an interest rate differential,

2

financiers’ limited risk-bearing capacity precludes them from taking enough risk to completely exploit the profitability of the trade. Similarly, financial disruptions generate a need to increase the
expected returns of the carry trade: this is achieved with an immediate loss in the carry trade and an
expectation of its recovery going forward.
The exchange rate is disconnected from traditional macroeconomic fundamentals such as imports, exports, consumption and output in as much as these same fundamentals correspond to different equilibrium exchange rates depending on financiers’ balance sheets and risk-bearing capacity.
Financiers both act as shock absorbers, by using their risk bearing capacity to accommodate flows
that result from fundamental shocks, and are themselves the source of financial shocks that distort
exchange rates.
The financial determination of exchange rates in imperfect financial markets has real consequences for output and risk sharing. To more fully analyze these consequences, we extend the basic
model by introducing a simple model of production under both flexible and sticky prices. For example, in the presence of goods’ prices that are sticky in the producers’ currencies, a capital inflow
or financial shock that produces an overly appreciated exchange rate causes a fall in demand for the
inflow-receiving country’s exports and a corresponding fall in output. This perverse effect of capital
flows transmits frictions from financial markets to the real economy.
In our model, currency intervention by the government is effective because, as a capital flow,
it alters the balance sheet of constrained financiers. The potency of the intervention relies entirely
on the frictions; there would be no effect from the intervention absent financial imperfections. We
show that a commonly-adopted policy combination of currency intervention and capital controls
can be understood in our model as capital controls exacerbating financial imperfections, thus further
segmenting the currency market and increasing the potency of currency intervention. We show that
if a country has an overly appreciated currency and its output is demand-driven, i.e. output would
increase via an increase in exports if the currency were to depreciate, then a currency intervention
increases output at the cost of distorting consumption risk-sharing intertemporally.
Throughout the paper we stress tractability and make simplifying functional assumptions that
make our model a convenient specification. We believe that the simple modeling we provide offers
a number of insights with pencil-and-paper analysis. Of course, we also appreciate the need for
optimization and general equilibrium, both of which are present in our set-up. However, we leave

3

for the appendix and, in large part, to future research to provide deeper contracting foundations for
the frictions that we study and to assess in a large-scale model their quantitative implications.
This paper is related to three broad streams of literature: early literature on portfolio balance, literature on portfolio demand in complete or incomplete markets, and literature on frictions and asset
demand. Our paper is inspired by a number of ideas in the early literature on portfolio balance models by Kouri (1976) and Driskill and McCafferty (1980a).2 A number of prominent economists have
lamented that this earlier research effort “had its high watermark and to a large extent a terminus
in Branson and Henderson (1985) handbook chapter” (see Obstfeld (2004)) and is “now largely and
unjustly forgotten” (see Blanchard, Giavazzi and Sa (2005)). The literature that followed this earlier
modeling effort has either focused on UIP-based analysis (Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995)) or mostly focused on currency risk premia in complete markets (Lucas, 1982; Backus, Kehoe and Kydland, 1992;
Backus and Smith, 1993; Dumas, 1992; Verdelhan, 2010; Colacito and Croce, 2011; Hassan, 2013).3
Pavlova and Rigobon (2007) analyze a real model with complete markets where countries’ representative agents have logarithmic preferences affected by taste shocks similar to those considered in this
paper.4 A smaller literature has analyzed the importance of incomplete markets (for recent examples:
Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2002); Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc (2008); Pavlova and Rigobon (2012)).
The most closely related stream of the literature is the small set of papers that focused on exchange rate modeling in the presence of frictions. One important set of papers by Jeanne and Rose
(2002); Evans and Lyons (2002); Hau and Rey (2006); Bruno and Shin (2014) studies frictions in financial markets in the absence of a real side of the economy with production, imports, and exports. One
other important set of papers has a very different focus: informational frictions, infrequent portfolio rebalancing, or frictions in access to domestic money/funding market. Evans and Lyons (2012)
focuses on how disaggregate order flows from customers might convey information about the economy fundamentals to exchange rate market makers who observe the consolidated flow. Bacchetta
and Van Wincoop (2010) studies the implications of agents that infrequently rebalance their portfolio in an OLG setting. Alvarez, Atkeson and Kehoe (2002, 2009) and Maggiori (2014) are models of
exchange rates where the frictions, a form of market segmentation, are only present in the domestic
2 An active early literature also includes: Allen and Kenen (1983); Henderson and Rogoff (1982); Dornbusch and Fischer
(1980); Calvo and Rodriguez (1977); Branson, Halttunen and Masson (1979); Tobin and de Macedo (1979); Diebold and
Pauly (1988); Driskill and McCafferty (1980b); de Macedo and Lempinen (2013). De Grauwe (1982) considers the role of the
banking sector in generating portfolio demands.

Let us start with a minimalistic model of financial determination of exchange rates in imperfect financial markets. This simple real model carries most of the economic intuition and core modeling
that we will then extend to more general set-ups.
Time is discrete and there are two periods: t = 0, 1. There are two countries, the USA and Japan,
each populated by a continuum of households. Households produce, trade (internationally) in a
market for goods, and invest with financiers in risk-free bonds in their domestic currency.5 Financiers
intermediate the capital flows resulting from households’ investment decisions. The basic structure
of the model is displayed in Figure I.

Intermediation is not perfect because of the limited commitment of the financiers. The limitedcommitment friction induces a downward sloping demand curve for risk taking by financiers. As a
result, capital flows from households move financiers up and down their demand curve. Equilibrium
is achieved by a relative price, in this case the exchange rate, adjusting so that international financial
markets clear given the demand and supply of capital denominated in different currencies. In this
sense, exchange rates are financially determined in an imperfect capital market.
We now describe each of the model’s actors, their optimization problems, and analyze the resulting equilibrium.
5 In the absence of a nominal side to the model, which we add in Section IV, we intentionally abuse the word “currency"
to mean a claim to the numéraire of the economy, and “exchange rate" to mean the real exchange rate. Similarly we abuse
the words “Dollar or Yen denominated" to mean values expressed in units of non-tradable goods in each economy.

II.A

Households

Households in the US derive utility from the consumption of goods according to:

θ0 ln C0 + βE [θ1 ln C1 ] ,

(1)

where C is a consumption basket defined as:
1

Ct ≡ [(CNT,t )χt (CH,t ) at (CF,t )ιt ] θt ,

(2)

where CNT,t is the US consumption of its non-tradable goods, CH,t is the US consumption of its
domestic tradable goods, and CF,t is the US consumption of Japanese tradable goods. We use the
notation {χt , at , ι t } for non-negative, potentially stochastic, preference parameters and we define
θt ≡ χt + at + ι t . The non-tradable good is the numéraire in each economy and, consequently, its
price equals 1 in domestic currency (p NT = 1).
Households can trade both tradable goods in a frictionless goods market across countries, but
can only trade non-tradable goods within their domestic country. Financial markets are incomplete
and each country trades a risk-free domestic currency bond. The assumption that each country only
trades in its own currency bonds is made here for simplicity and to emphasize the currency mismatch
that the financiers have to absorb; we relax the assumption in later sections. Risk-free here refers to
paying one unit of non-tradable goods in all states of the world and is therefore akin to “nominally
risk free".
US households’ optimization problem is:

(CNT,t ,CH,t ,CF,t )t=0,1

t =0

t =0

∑ R−t (YNT,t + p H,t YH,t ) = ∑ R−t (CNT,t + p H,t CH,t + pF,t CF,t ) .

US households maximize the utility by choosing their consumption and savings in dollar bonds
subject to the state-by-state dynamic budget constraint. The households’ optimization problem can
be divided into two separate problems. The first is a static problem, whereby households decide,
given their total consumption expenditure for the period, how to allocate resources to the consump6

tion of various goods. The second is a dynamic problem, whereby households decide intertemporally
how much to save and consume.
The static utility maximization problem takes the form:

(5)

max

CNT,t ,CH,t ,CF,t

χt ln CNT,t + at ln CH,t + ι t ln CF,t + λt (CEt − CNT,t − p H,t CH,t − p F,t CF,t ) ,

where CEt is aggregate consumption expenditure, which is taken as exogenous in this static optimization problem and later endogenized in the dynamic optimization problem, λt is the associated
Lagrange multiplier, p H,t is the Dollar price in the US of US tradables, and p F,t is the Dollar price
in the US of Japanese tradables. First-order conditions imply:

χt
CNT,t

= λt , and

ιt
CF,t

= λt p F,t . We

assume that non-tradable goods are produced by an endowment process that for simplicity follows
YNT,t = χt , unless otherwise stated. This simplifying assumption, combined with the market clearing condition for non-tradables YNT,t = CNT,t , implies that in equilibrium λt = 1 in all states. The
assumption, while stark, makes the analysis of the basic model most tractable by neutralizing variations in household marginal utility that are not at the core of our paper. The neutralization occurs
because variation in household marginal utility is stabilized by a proportionate increase in the consumption of the non-tradable good.6 With this assumption in hand, the Dollar value of US imports
is:
p F,t CF,t = ι t ,
Japanese households derive utility from consumption according to: θ0∗ ln C0∗ + β∗ E [θ1∗ ln C1∗ ],
where starred variables denote Japanese quantities and prices. By analogy with the US case, the

The exchange rate et is defined as the quantity of dollars bought by 1 yen, i.e. the strength of the

We stress that the assumption is one of convenience, and not necessary for the economics of the paper. Online appendix
A.4 provides more general results that do not impose this assumption.

provides a detailed discussion of different exchange rate concepts in this economy including the nominal and CPI-based
real exchange rate.

is: et ξ t . US net exports, expressed in dollars, are given by: NXt = et p∗H,t CH,t
F,t F,t = ξ t et − ι t .

We collect these results in the Lemma below.
Lemma 1. (Net Exports) Expressed in dollars, US exports to Japan are ξ t et ; US imports from Japan are ι t ; so
that US net exports are NXt = ξ t et − ι t .
Note that this result is independent of the pricing procedure (e.g. price stickiness under either
producer or local currency pricing). Under producer currency pricing (PCP) and in the absence of
trade costs, the US Dollar price of Japanese tradables is p H /e, while under local currency pricing
(LCP) the price is simply p∗H .
It follows that under financial autarky, i.e. if trade has to be balanced period by period, the
equilibrium exchange rate is: et =

ιt
ξt .

In financial autarky, the Dollar depreciates (↑ e) whenever US

demand for Japanese goods increases (↑ ι) or whenever Japanese demand for US goods falls (↓ ξ).
This has to occur because there is no mechanism, in this case, to absorb the excess demand/supply
of dollars versus yen that a non-zero trade balance would generate.
The optimization problem (3) for the intertemporal consumption-saving decision leads to a standard
optimality condition (Euler equation):

where Ut,C
is the marginal utility at time t over the consumption of non-tradables. Given our
NT

simplifying assumption that CNT,t = χt , the above Euler equation implies that R = 1/β. An entirely
similar derivation yields: R∗ = 1/β∗ . It might appear surprising that in a model with risk averse
agents the equilibrium interest rate equals the rate of time preference. Of course, this occurs here
because the marginal utility of non-tradable consumption, in which the bonds are denominated, is
constant in equilibrium given the assumption CNT,t = χt ; so that the precautionary and intertemporal
consumption smoothing desires simplify to be exactly zero.
We stress that the aim of our simplifying assumptions is to create a real structure of the basic
economy that captures the main forces (demand and supply of goods), while making the real side of
the economy as simple as possible. This will allow us to analytically flesh out the crucial forces of
the paper in the financial markets in the next sections without carrying around a burdensome real

structure. Should the reader be curious as to the robustness of our model to relaxing some of the
assumptions made so far, the quick answer is that it is quite robust.9

II.B

Financiers

Suppose that global financial markets are imbalanced, such that there is an excess supply of dollars
versus yen resulting from, for example, trade or portfolio flows. Who will be willing to absorb such
an imbalance by providing Japan those yen, and holding those dollars? We posit that the resulting
imbalances are absorbed, at some premium, by global financiers.
We assume that there is a unit mass of global financial firms, each managed by a financier. Agents
from the two countries are selected at random to run the financial firms for a single period.10 Financiers start their jobs with no capital of their own and can trade bonds denominated in both curq

rencies. Therefore, their balance sheet consists of q0 dollars and − e00 yen, where q0 is the Dollar value
q

of Dollar-denominated bonds the financier is long of and − e00 the corresponding value in Yen of Yendenominated bonds. At the end of (each) period, financiers pay their profits and losses out to the
households.11
We assume that each financier maximizes the expected value of her firm:

This valuation of currency trading corresponds to that of the household if they were allowed to
trade optimally in foreign currency. Indeed, if US households were allowed to trade optimally Yen
bonds as well as Dollar bonds we would recover the standard Euler equation:

this set-up, being a financier is an occupation for agents in the two countries rather than an entirely separate class of
agents. The selection process is governed by a memoryless Poisson distribution. Of course, there are no selection issues in
the one period basic economy considered here, but we proceed to describe a more general set-up that will also be used in
the model extensions.
11 An interesting literature also stresses the importance of global financial frictions for the international transmission of
shocks, but does not study exchange rates: Kollmann, Enders and Müller (2011); Kollmann (2013); Dedola, Karadi and
Lombardo (2013); Perri and Quadrini (2014).

rived in the previous subsection (see equation (6)). Households optimally value the currency trade according to its expected (discounted at R) excess returns. Notice that this mean-return criterion holds
despite the households being risk averse. The simplification occurs because variations in marginal
utility are exactly offset by variations in the relative price of non-tradable goods, so that marginal
utility in terms of the numéraire (the NT good) is constant across states of the world. In the absence
of frictions our financiers would simply be a veil and the optimality condition in maximization (7)
i

would impose the household optimality criterion: 0 = E β R − R e0 .
To capture the role of limited financial risk-bearing capacity by the financiers we assume that
in each period, after taking positions but before shocks are realized, the financier can divert a portion of the funds she intermediates. If the financier diverts the funds, her firm is unwound and

, where

Γ = γ var (e1 )α , with γ ≥ 0, α ≥ 0.12 The appendix at the end of the paper provides further details
and regularity conditions for this constraint. As will become clear below, our functional assumption
regarding the diversion of funds is not only a convenient specification for tractability, but also stresses
the idea that financiers’ outside options increase in the size and volatility, or complexity, of their balance sheet. This constraint captures the relevant market practice in financial institutions whereby
risk taking is limited not only by the overall size of the positions, position limits, but also by their
expected riskiness, often measured by their variance. It is outside the scope of this paper to provide
deeper foundations for this constraint. The reader can think of it as a convenient specification of a
more complicated contracting problem.13 Since creditors, when lending to the financier, correctly
anticipate the incentives of the financier to divert funds, the financier is subject to a credit constraint

foundations could potentially be achieved in models of financial complexity where bigger and riskier balance
sheets lead to more complex positions. In turn, these more complex positions are more difficult and costly for creditors to

The demand for dollars decreases in the strength of the dollar (i.e. increases in e0 ), controlling for
the future value of the Dollar (i.e. controlling for e1 ). Notice that Γ governs the ability of financiers
to bear risks; hence in the rest of the paper we refer to Γ as the financiers’ risk bearing capacity. The
higher Γ, the lower the financiers’ risk bearing capacity, the steeper their demand curve, and the
more segmented the asset market. To understand the behavior of this demand, let us consider two
polar opposite cases. When Γ = 0, financiers are able to absorb any imbalances, i.e. they want to
14 We

generalize these constraints by studying cases where the outside option is directly increasing in the size of the
balance sheet and its variance. Adrian and Shin (2013) provide foundations and empirical evidence for a value-at-risk
constraint that shares some of the properties of our constraint above.
15 Intuitively, given any non-zero expected excess return in the currency market, the financier will want to either borrow
or lend as much as possible in Dollar and Yen bonds. The constraint limits the maximum position and therefore binds. We
make the very mild assumption that the model parameters always imply: Ω0 ≥ −1. That is, we assume that the expected
excess returns from currency speculation never exceed 100% in absolute value. This bound is several order of magnitudes
greater than the expected returns in the data (of the order of 0-6%) and has no economic bearing on our model.

uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) holds: E e0 − e1 RR = 0. When Γ ↑ ∞, then Q0 = 0; financiers
are unwilling to absorb any imbalances, i.e. they do not want to take any positions, no matter what
the expected returns from risk-taking. In the intermediate cases (0 < Γ < ∞) the model endogenously generates a deviation from UIP and relates it to financiers’ risk taking. On the contrary, since
the covered interest rate parity (CIP) condition is an arbitrage involving no risk it is always satisfied.
Similarly the model smoothly converges to the frictionless benchmark (Γ ↓ 0) as the economy becomes deterministic (var (e1 ) ↓ 0). Section III.A studies the carry trade and provides further analysis
on UIP and CIP.
Since Γ, the financiers’ risk bearing capacity, plays a crucial role in our theory, we refer hereafter
to the setup described so far as the basic Gamma model. In many instances, like the one above, it is most
intuitive to consider comparative statics on Γ rather than its subcomponents, and we do so for the
remainder of the paper; in some instances it is interesting to consider the effect of each subcomponent
γ and var (e1 ) separately.16
We stress that the above demand function captures the spirit of international financial intermediation by providing a simple and tractable specification for the constrained portfolio problem that
generates the demand function that has been central to the limits of arbitrage theory pioneered by
De Long et al. (1990a,b), Shleifer and Vishny (1997), and Gromb and Vayanos (2002). We follow the
pragmatic tradition of macroeconomics and frictional finance, and we take as given the prevalence
of frictions and short-term debt in different currencies, and proceed to analyze their equilibrium
implications. This direct approach to modeling financial imperfections has a long standing tradition and has proved very fruitful with recent contributions by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997); Gromb
and Vayanos (2002); Mendoza, Quadrini and Rıos-Rull (2009); Mendoza (2010); Gertler and Kiyotaki
(2010); Garleanu and Pedersen (2011); Perri and Quadrini (2014).17
For simplicity, we assume (for now and for much of this paper) that financiers rebate their profits
and losses to the Japanese households, not the US ones. This asymmetry gives much tractability to
the model, at fairly little cost to the economics.18
16 The reader is encouraged either to intuitively consider the case α = 0, or to follow the formal proofs that show the sign
of the comparative statics to be invariant in Γ and γ.
17 Even in the most recent macro-finance literature in closed economy, intense foundations of the contracting environment have either been excluded or relegated to separate companion pieces (Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014); He and
Krishnamurthy (2013)). See Duffie (2010) for an overview.
18 For completeness, note that this assumption had already been implicitly made in deriving the US households’ inter-

12

Before moving to the equilibrium, note that we are modeling the ability of financiers to bear
substantial risks over a horizon that ranges from a quarter to a few years. Our model is silent on
the high frequency market-making activities of currency desks in investment banks. To make this
distinction intuitive, let us consider that the typical daily volume of foreign exchange transactions is
estimated to be $5.3 trillion.19 This trading is highly concentrated among the market making desks of
banks and is the subject of attention in the market microstructure literature pioneered by Evans and
Lyons (2002). While these microstructure effects are interesting, we completely abstract away from
these activities by assuming that there is instantaneous and perfect risk sharing across financiers, so
that any trade that matches is executed frictionlessly and nets out. We are only concerned with the
ultimate risk, most certainly a small fraction of the total trading volume, which financiers have to
bear over quarters and years because households’ demand is unbalanced.20

II.C

Equilibrium Exchange Rate

Recall that for simplicity we are for now only considering imbalances resulting from trade flows
(imbalances from portfolio flows will soon follow). The key equations of the model are the financiers’
demand:

and the equilibrium “flow” demand for dollars in the Dollar-Yen market at times t = 0, 1:

temporal budget constraint in equation (4). This assumption is relaxed in the online appendix, where we solve for general
and symmetric payoff functions numerically.
19 Source: Bank of International Settlements (2013).
20 This is consistent with evidence that market-making desks in large investment banks, for example Goldman Sachs,
might intermediate very large volumes on a daily basis but are almost always carrying no residual risk at the end of
the business day. In contrast, proprietary trading desks (before recent changes in legislation) or investment management
divisions of the same investment banks carry substantial amounts of risk over horizons ranging from a quarter to a few
years. These investment activities are the focus of this paper. Similarly, our financiers capture the risk-taking activities of
hedge funds and investment managers that have no market making interests and are therefore not the center of attention
in the microstructure literature.

13

Equation (13) is the market clearing equation for the Dollar against Yen market at time zero. It states
that the net demand for Dollar against Yen has to be zero for the market to clear. The net demand has
two components: ξ 0 e0 − ι0 , from US net exports, and Q0 , from financiers. Recall that we assume that
US households do not hold any currency exposure: they convert their Japanese sales of ξ 0 yen into
dollars, for a demand ξ 0 e0 of dollars. Likewise, Japanese households have ι0 dollars worth of exports
to the US and sell them, as they only keep Yen balances.21 At time one, equation (14) shows that
the same net-export channel generates a demand for dollars of ξ 1 e1 − ι1 ; while the financiers need to
sell their dollar position RQ0 that has accrued interest at rate R.22 We now explore the equilibrium
exchange rate in this simple setup.
Equilibrium exchange rate: a first pass

To streamline the algebra and concentrate on the key

economic content, we assume for now that β = β∗ = 1, which implies R = R∗ = 1, and that ξ t = 1
for t = 0, 1. Adding equations (13) and (14) yields the US external intertemporal budget constraint:

e1 + e0 = ι 0 + ι 1 .

(15)

Taking expectations on both sides: E [e1 ] = ι0 + E[ι1 ] − e0 . From the financiers’ demand equation we
have:
E [e1 ] = e0 − ΓQ0 = e0 − Γ (ι0 − e0 ) = (1 + Γ) e0 − Γι0 ,
where the second equality follows from equation (13). Equating the two expressions for the time-one
expected exchange rate, we have:
E [e1 ] = ι0 + E[ι1 ] − e0 = (1 + Γ) e0 − Γι0 .

Solving this linear equation for the exchange rate at time zero, we conclude:

e0 =

(1 + Γ ) ι 0 + E[ ι 1 ]
.
2+Γ

21 These assumptions are later relaxed in Section II.D and in the online appendix where households are allowed to have
(limited) foreign currency positions.
22 At the end of period 0, the financiers own Q dollars and − Q /e yen. Therefore, at the beginning of period one, they
0
0 0
hold RQ0 dollars and − R∗ Q0 /e0 yen. At time one, they unwind their positions and give the net profits to their principals,
which we assume for simplicity to be the Japanese households. Hence they sell RQ0 dollars in the Dollar-Yen market at
time one.

14

We define { X } ≡ X − E[ X ] to be the innovation to a random variable X. Then, the exchange rate at
time t = 1 is:
e1 = ι 0 + ι 1 − e0 = ι 0 + E [ ι 1 ] + { ι 1 } − e0

= { ι 1 } + ι 0 + E[ ι 1 ] −

This implies that var (e1 ) = var (ι1 ), so that, by (11), Γ = γ var (ι1 )α .
We collect these results in the Proposition below.
Proposition 1. (Basic Gamma equilibrium exchange rate) Assume that ξ t = 1 for t = 0, 1, and that
interest rates are zero in both countries. The exchange rate follows:

(1+ Γ ) ι 0 +E[ ι 1 ]

Furthermore, Γ = γ var (ι1 )α .
Depending on Γ, the time-zero exchange rate varies between two polar opposites: the UIP-based
and the financial-autarky exchange rates, respectively. Both extremes are important benchmarks of
open economy analysis, and the choice of Γ allows us to modulate our model between these two
useful benchmarks. Γ ↑ ∞ results in e0 =

ι0
ξ0 ,

which we have shown in Section II.A to be the financial

autarky value of the exchange rate. Intuitively, financiers have so little risk-bearing capacity that
no financial flows can occur between countries and, therefore, trade has to be balanced period by
period. When Γ = 0, UIP holds and we obtain e0 =

ι 0 +E[ ι 1 ]
.
2

Intuitively, financiers are so relaxed about

risk taking that they are willing to take infinite positions in currencies whenever there is a positive
expected excess return from doing so. UIP only imposes a constant exchange rate in expectation
E[e1 ] = e0 ; the level of the exchange rate is then obtained by additionally using the inter-temporal
budget constraint in equation (15).
To further understand the effect of Γ, notice that at the end of period 0 (say, time 0+ ), the US
net foreign asset (NFA) position is N0+ = ξ 0 e0 − ι0 =

E[ι1 ]−ι0
2+ Γ .

Therefore, the US has positive NFA

at t = 0+ iff ι0 < E [ι1 ]. If the US has a positive NFA position, then financiers are long the Yen
15

and short the Dollar. For financiers to bear this risk, they require a compensation: the Yen needs to
appreciate in expectation. The required appreciation is generated by making the Yen weaker at time
zero. The magnitude of the effect depends on the extent of the financiers’ risk bearing capacity (Γ),
as formally shown here by taking partial derivatives:

2+Γ , where

is the US net foreign asset (NFA) position. When there is a financial

disruption (↑ γ, ↑ Γ), countries that are net external debtors ( N0+ < 0) experience a currency depreciation
(↑ e), while the opposite is true for net-creditor countries.
Intuitively, net external-debtor countries have borrowed from the world financial system, thus generating a long exposure for financiers to their currencies. Should the financial system’s risk bearing
capacity be disrupted, these currencies would depreciate to compensate financiers for the increased
(perceived) risk. This modeling formalizes a number of external crises where broadly defined global
risk aversion shocks, embodied here in Γ, caused large depreciations of the currencies of countries
that had recently experienced large capital inflows. Della Corte, Riddiough and Sarno (2014) confirm
our theoretical prediction in the data. They show that net-debtor countries’ currencies have higher
returns than net-creditors’ currencies, tend to be on the receiving end of carry trade related speculative flows, and depreciate when financial disruptions occur. In this basic model the entire external
balance of a country is absorbed by the financier; we will relax this shortly by providing a distinct
role between Q and the external balance. Here we clarify that the driving force behind the result in
Proposition 2 is the position of the financiers, i.e. what matters for the effect of an increase in Γ on the
exchange rate if whether Q is positive on negative. The proposition stresses the idea that financiers
are more likely to be long the currency of debtor countries since these countries have borrowed from
the world financial system.23
To illustrate how the results derived so far readily extend to more general cases, we report below
expressions allowing for stochastic US export shocks ξ t , as well as non-zero interest rates. Several
more extensions can be found in Section IV and the online appendix.
23 In

mapping the proposition into the data one can think that the net foreign asset positions are correlated with Q, but
the correlation can be less than perfect, with instances like the US where the two might be substantially different (see Shin
(2012); Maggiori (2014)).

II.D

The Impact of Portfolio Flows

We now further illustrate how the supply and demand of assets do matter for the financial determination of
the exchange rate. We stress the importance of portfolio flows in addition, and perhaps more importantly than, trade flows for our framework. The basic model so far has focused on current account, or
net foreign asset, based flows; we introduce here pure portfolio flows that alter the countries’ gross
external positions. We focus here on the simplest form of portfolio flows from households, not so
much for their complete realism, but because they allow for the sharpest analysis of the main forces
of the model. The online appendix extends this minimalistic section to more general flows.

II.D.1

Asset Flows Matter in the Gamma Model

Consider the case where Japanese households have, at time zero, an inelastic demand (e.g. some noise
trading) f ∗ of Dollar bonds funded by an offsetting position − f ∗ /e0 in Yen bonds. Both transactions
face the financiers as counterparties.
While we take these flows as exogenous, they can be motivated as a liquidity shock, or perhaps
as a decision resulting from bounded rationality or portfolio delegation. Technically, the maximiza-

17

tion problem for the Japanese household is the one written before, where the portfolio flow is not a
decision variable coming from a maximization, but is simply an exogenous action.24
The flow equations are now given by:
ξ 0 e0 − ι0 + Q0 + f ∗ = 0,

(20)

The financiers’ demand is still Q0 = Γ1 E e0 −

. The equilibrium exchange rate is derived in the

Proposition below.
Proposition 4. (Gross capital flows and exchange rates) Assume ξ t = R = R∗ = 1 for t = 0, 1. With
an inelastic time-zero additional demand f ∗ for Dollar bonds by Japanese households who correspondingly sell

− f ∗ /e0 of Yen bonds, the exchange rates at times t = 0, 1 are:
e0 =

(1 + Γ ) ι 0 + E[ ι 1 ] − Γ f ∗
;
2+Γ

e1 = { ι 1 } +

ι 0 + (1 + Γ ) E[ ι 1 ] + Γ f ∗
.
2+Γ

Hence, additional demand f ∗ for dollars at time zero induces a Dollar appreciation at time zero, and subsequent
depreciation at time one. However, the time-average value of the Dollar is unchanged: e0 + e1 = ι0 + ι1 ,
independently of f ∗ . Furthermore, Γ = γ var (ι1 )α .
Proof. Define: ι̃0 ≡ ι0 − f ∗ , and ι̃1 ≡ ι1 + f ∗ . Given equations (20), our “tilde” economy is
isomorphic to the basic economy considered in equations (13) and (14). For instance, import demands
are now ι̃ t rather than ι t . Hence, Proposition 1 applies to this “tilde” economy, thus implying that:

(1 + Γ) ι̃0 + E[ι̃1 ]
(1 + Γ ) ι 0 + E[ ι 1 ] − Γ f ∗

An increase in Japanese demand for Dollar bonds needs to be absorbed by financiers, who correspondingly need to sell Dollar bonds and buy Yen bonds. To induce financiers to provide the desired
bonds, the Dollar needs to appreciate on impact as a result of the capital flow, in order to then be expected to depreciate, thus generating an expected gain for the financiers’ short Dollar positions. This
example emphasizes that our model is an elementary one where a relative price, the exchange rate,

has to move in order to equate the supply and demand of two assets, Yen and Dollar bonds. The
capital flows considered in this section are gross flows that do not alter the net foreign asset position,
thus introducing a first example of the distinct role for the financiers’ balance sheet from the country
net foreign asset position. In the data gross flows are much larger than net flows and we provide a
reason why they play an important role in determining the exchange rate.25
This framework can analyze concrete situations, such as the recent large scale capital flows from
developed countries into emerging market local-currency bond markets, say by US investors into
Brazilian Real bonds, that put upward pressure on the receiving countries’ currencies. While such
flows and their impact on currencies have been paramount in the logic of market participants and
policy makers, they had thus far proven elusive in a formal theoretical analysis.
Hau, Massa and Peress (2010) provide direct evidence that plausibly exogenous capital flows
impact the exchange rate in a manner consistent with the Gamma model. They show that, following
a restating of the weights of the MSCI World Equity Index, countries that as a result experienced
capital inflows (because their weight in the index increased) saw their currencies appreciate.
To stress the difference between our basic Gamma model of the financial determination of exchange rates in imperfect financial markets and the traditional macroeconomic framework, we next
illustrate two polar cases that have been popular in the previous literature: the UIP-based exchange
rate, and the complete market exchange rate.
Financial Flows in a UIP Model.

Much of the now classic international macroeconomic analysis

spurred by Dornbusch (1976) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) either directly assumes that UIP holds
or effectively imposes it by solving a first order linearization of the model.26 The closest analog to
this literature in the basic Gamma model is the case where Γ = 0, such that UIP holds by assumption.
In this world, financiers are so relaxed, i.e. their risk bearing capacity is so ample, about supplying
liquidity to satisfy shifts in the world demand for assets that such shifts have no impact on expected
returns. Consider the example of US investors suddenly wanting to buy Brazilian Real bonds; in this
case financiers would simply take the other side of the investors’ portfolio demand with no effect on
the exchange rate between the Dollar and the Real. In fact, equation (21) confirms that if Γ = 0, then
25 One could extend the distinction between country level positions and financiers’ balance sheet further by modeling
situations where not all gross flows are stuck, either temporarily or permanently, on the balance sheet of the financiers.
26 Intuitively, a first order linearization imposes certainty equivalence on the model and therefore kills any risk premia
such as those that could generate a deviation from UIP.

19

portfolio flow f ∗ has no impact on the equilibrium exchange rate.27
Financial Flows in a Complete Market Model. Another strand of the literature has analyzed risk
premia predominantly under complete markets. We now show that the exchange rate in a setup with
complete markets (and no frictions) but otherwise identical to ours is constant, and therefore trivially
not affected by the flows.
Lemma 3. (Complete Markets) In an economy identical to the set-up of the basic Gamma model, other than
the fact that financial markets are complete and frictionless, the equilibrium exchange rate is constant: et = ν,
where ν is the relative Negishi weight of Japan.
Here, we only sketch the logic and the main equations; a full treatment is relegated to the online
appendix. Under complete markets, the marginal utility of US and Japanese agents must be equal
when expressed in a common currency. Intuitively, the full risk sharing that occurs under complete
markets calls for Japan and the US to have the same marginal benefit from consuming an extra unit
of non-tradables. In our set-up, this risk sharing condition takes a simple form:

χt /CNT,t
et
∗
χ∗t /CNT,t

= ν, where

∗
ν is a constant.28 Simple substitution of the conditions CNT,t = χt and CNT,t
= χ∗t shows that et = ν,

i.e. the exchange rate is constant.29

II.D.2

Flows, not just Stocks, Matter in the Gamma model

In frictionless models only stocks matter, not flows per se. In the Gamma model, instead, flows per
se matter. This is a distinctive feature of our model. To illustrate this, consider the case where the US
has an exogenous Dollar-denominated debt toward Japan, equal to D0 due at time zero, and D1 due
at time one.30 For simplicity, assume β = β∗ = R = R∗ = ξ t = 1 for t = 0, 1. Hence, total debt is
D0 + D1 . The flow equations now are:
e0 − ι0 − D0 + Q0 = 0;

e1 − ι1 − D1 − Q0 = 0.

27 These

gross flows do not play a role in determining the exchange rate even in models, for example Schmitt-Grohé and
Uribe (2003), that assume reduced-form deviations from UIP to be convex functions of the net foreign asset position.
28 Formally, the constant is the relative Pareto weight assigned to Japan in the planner’s problem that solves for completemarket allocations.
29 The irrelevance of the f gross flows generalizes also to complete, and incomplete, market models where the exchange
rate is not constant and the presence of a risk premium makes the two currencies imperfect substitutes. Intuitively in these
models the state variables are ratios of stocks of assets, such as wealth, and since these gross flows do not alter the value of
such stocks, they have no equilibrium effects because the agents can frictionlessly unwind them. In our model they have
effects because these flows alter the balance sheet of constrained financiers.
30 Hence, the new budget constraint is 1
∑t=0 R−t (YNT,t + p H,t YH,t − Dt ) = ∑1t=0 R−t (CNT,t + p H,t CH,t + p F,t CF,t ) .

20

The exchange rate at time zero is:

e0 =

(1 + Γ) ι0 + E [ι1 ] (1 + Γ) D0 + D1

.
2+Γ
2+Γ

Hence, when finance is imperfect (Γ > 0), both the timing of debt flows, as indicated by the term

(1 + Γ) D0 + D1 , and the total stock of debt (D0 + D1 ) matter in determining exchange rates. The


Γ
1
early flow, D0 , receives a higher weight 12+
+Γ than the late flow, D1 , 2+Γ . In sum, flows, not just
stocks, matter for exchange rate determination.
To highlight the contrast, let us parametrize the debt repayments as: D0 = F and D1 = − F + S.
The parameter F alters the flow of debt repayment at time zero, but leaves the total stock of debt
(D0 + D1 = S) unchanged. The parameter S, instead, alters the total stock of debt, but does not
affect the flow of repayment at time zero. We note that:

Proposition 5. (Stock Vs flow matters in the Gamma model) Flows matter for the exchange rate when

bearing capacity is very ample (Γ = 0), only stocks matter.

II.D.3

The Exchange Rate Disconnect

The Meese and Rogoff (1983) result on the inability of economic fundamentals such as output, inflation, exports and imports to predict, or even contemporaneously co-move with, exchange rates
has had a chilling and long-lasting effect on theoretical research in the field (see Obstfeld and Rogoff
(2001)).31 The Gamma model helps to reconcile the disconnect by introducing financial forces, both
the risk bearing capacity Γ and the balance sheet Q, as determinants of exchange rates. Intuitively
a disconnect occurs because economies with identical fundamentals feature different equilibrium
exchange rates depending on the incentives of the financiers to hold the resulting (gross) global imbalances.
31 Some

forecastability of exchange rates using traditional fundamentals appears to occur at very-long horizons (e.g. 10
years) in Mark (1995) or for specific currencies, such as the US Dollar, using transformations of the balance of payments
data (Gourinchas and Rey (2007b); Gourinchas, Govillot and Rey (2010)).

21

Recently new evidence has been building in favor of these new financial channels. In addition
to the instrumental variable approach in Hau, Massa and Peress (2010) discussed earlier, Froot and
Ramadorai (2005); Adrian, Etula and Groen (2011); Hong and Yogo (2012); Kim, Liao and Tornell
(2014), and Adrian, Etula and Shin (2014) find that flows, financial conditions, and financiers’ positions provide information about expected currency returns. Froot and Ramadorai (2005) show that
medium-term variation in expected currency returns is mostly associated with capital flows, while
long-term variation is more strongly associated with macroeconomic fundamentals. Hong and Yogo
(2012) show that speculators’ positions in the futures currency market contain information that is
useful, beyond the interest rate differential, to forecast future currency returns. Adrian, Etula and
Groen (2011); Adrian, Etula and Shin (2014) show that empirical proxies for financial conditions and
the tightness of financiers’ constraints help forecast both currency returns and exchange rates. Kim,
Liao and Tornell (2014) show that information extracted from the speculators’ positions in the futures
currency market helps to predict exchange rate changes at horizons between 6 and 12 months.
The model can also help to rationalize the co-movement across bilateral exchange rates and between exchange rates and other asset classes. Intuitively, this occurs because all these assets are
traded by financiers and are therefore affected to some degree by the same financial forces. Verdelhan (2013) shows that there is substantial co-movement between bilateral exchange rates both in
developed and emerging economies, while Dumas and Solnik (1995); Hau and Rey (2006); Farhi and
Gabaix (2014); Verdelhan (2013); Lettau, Maggiori and Weber (2014) link movements in exchange
rates to movements in equity markets.

Closing the Economy: Endowments, Production, and Unemployment

Very little has been said so far about output; we now close the model by describing the output market.
To build up the intuition for our framework, we consider first a full endowment economy, and then
consider production economies under both flexible and sticky prices.
∗ , Y }1
Endowment Economy Let all output stochastic processes {YNT,t , YH,t , YNT,t
F,t t=0 be exogenous

strictly-positive endowments. Assuming that all prices are flexible and that the law of one price
(LOP) holds, one has: p H,t = p∗H,t et , and p F,t = p∗F,t et .
Summing US and Japanese demand for US tradable goods (CH,t =

22

p H,t

∗
and CH,t

re-

spectively, which are derived as in Section II.A), we obtain the world demand for US tradables:
∗ =
D H,t ≡ CH,t + CH,t

a t + ξ t et
p H,t .

Clearing the goods market, YH,t = D H,t , yields the equilibrium price in

dollars of US tradables: p H,t =

at + ξ t et
YH,t .

a∗t + et

YF,t
ι

An entirely similar argument yields:

Production Without Price Rigidities.

p∗F,t

=

.

Let us introduce a minimal model of production that will

allow us to formalize the effects of the exchange rate on output and employment. While we maintain
the assumption that non-tradable goods in each country are given by endowment processes, we now
assume that tradable goods in each country are produced with a technology linear in labor with unit
productivity. In each country, labor L is supplied inelastically and is internationally immobile.
Simple profit maximization at the firm level yields a Dollar wage in the US of w H,t = p H,t . Under
flexible prices, goods market clearing then implies full employment YH,t = L and a US tradable
price in dollars of: p◦H,t =

a t + ξ t et
L ,

where the circle in p◦ denotes a frictionless quantity. Likewise,

for Japanese tradables the equilibrium features both full employment YF,t = L and a Yen price of:
p∗◦
F,t =

a∗t +ι t /et
.
L

Production With Price Rigidities.

Let us now assume that wages are “downward rigid” in do-

mestic currency at a preset level of { p̄ H , p̄∗F }, where these prices are exogenous. Let us further
assume that firms do not engage in pricing to market, so that prices are sticky in producer cur
rency (PCP). Firm profit maximization then implies that: p H,t = max p H , p◦H,t ; or more explicitly:


p H,t = max p H , at +Let ξ t . Hence:

If demand is sufficiently low (at + ξ t et < p H L), then output is demand-determined (i.e., it depends
directly on: et , ξ t ,and at ) and there is unemployment: L − YH,t > 0. Notice that in this case the
exchange rate has an expenditure-switching effect: if the Dollar depreciates (et ↑), unemployment falls
and output expands in the US. Intuitively, since US tradables’ prices are sticky in dollars, these goods
become cheap for Japanese consumers to buy when the Dollar depreciates. In a world that is demand
constrained, this expansion in demand for US tradable is met by expanding production, thus raising
US output and employment.

Clearly, a similar expression and mechanism apply to Japanese tradables:

The expenditure switching role of exchange rates has been central to the Keynesian analysis of
open macroeconomics of Dornbusch (1976); Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995). In the Gamma model, it is
enriched by being the central channel for the transmission of financial forces affecting the exchange
rate, such as the risk-bearing capacity and balance sheet of the financiers, into output and employment.
The financial determination of exchange rates has real consequences. Let us reconsider our earlier example of a sudden inflow of capital from US investors into Brazilian Real bonds. The exchange
rate in this economy with production and sticky prices is still characterized by equation (21). As
previously discussed, the capital inflow in Brazil causes the Real to appreciate and,32 if the flow
is sufficiently strong ( f sufficiently high) or the financiers’ risk bearing capacity sufficiently low (Γ
sufficiently high), the appreciation (the increase in e0 ) can be so strong as to make Brazilian goods uncompetitive on international markets; the corresponding fall in world demand for Brazilian output
∗ =
(↓ C H

causes an economic slump in Brazil with both falling output and increasing unemploy-

ment.33
The main focus of our model is to disconnect the exchange rate from fundamentals by altering the
structure of financial markets. Of course, part of the disconnect in practice also comes from frictions
in the goods makers. These frictions can be analyzed in our model; we illustrate this by considering
prices that are sticky in the export destination currency (LCP). To make the point sharp, assume that
prices for US tradable goods are exogenously set at { p̄ H , p̄∗H } in dollars in the US and in yen in Japan,
respectively.
Lemma 4. (LCP vs PCP) Under Local Currency Pricing the value of the exchange rate is the same as
under Producer Currency Pricing, but US tradable output does not depend on the exchange rate: YH,t =

33 The Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega complained, as reported in Forbes Magazine (2011), that: “We have to
face the currency war without allowing our productive sector to suffer. If we allow [foreign] liquidity to [freely] enter [the
economy], it will bring the Dutch Disease to the economy.”
32 When

24

they are still ι t and et ξ t . Consequently, the value of net exports is unchanged, and the exchange rate
is unchanged from the previous formulae. Total demand is derived as above. .
LCP helps to further the disconnect between the exchange rate and fundamentals by preventing
output in the tradable sector from responding to the exchange rate.34

R EVISITING C ANONICAL I SSUES WITH THE G AMMA M ODEL

We consider in this section a number of canonical issues of international macroeconomics via the
lenses of the Gamma model. While these classic issues have also been the subject of previous literature, our analysis not only provides new insights, but also allows us to illustrate how the framework
built in the previous section provides a unified and tractable rationalization of empirical regularities
that are at the center of open-economy analysis.

III.A

The Carry Trade in the Presence of Financial Shocks

In the Gamma model there is a profitable carry trade. Let us give the intuition in terms of the most
basic model first and then extend it to a set-up with shocks to the financiers’ risk bearing capacity (Γ
shocks).
First, imagine a world in which countries are in financial autarky because the financiers have
zero risk bearing capacity (Γ = ∞), suppose that Japan has a 1% interest rate while the US has a 5%
interest rate, and that all periods (t = 0, ..., T ) are ex-ante identical with ξ t = 1 and ι t a martingale.
Thus, we have et = ι t , and the exchange rate is a random walk e0 = E [e1 ] = ... = E [eT ]. A small
financier with some available risk bearing capacity, e.g. a small hedge fund, could take advantage
of this trading opportunity and pocket the 4% interest rate differential. In this case, there is a very
profitable carry trade. As the financial sector risk bearing capacity expands (Γ becomes smaller, but
still positive), this carry trade becomes less profitable, but does not disappear entirely unless Γ = 0,
in which case the UIP condition holds. Intuitively, the carry trade in the basic Gamma model reflects
the risk compensation necessary to induce the financiers to intermediate global financial flows.
34 Devereux and Engel (2003) stressed the absence of exchange rate effects on output under LCP. The empirical evidence
shows that, in practice, a combination of PCP, LCP and limited pass-through are present in the data (see Gopinath and Itskhoki (2010); Gopinath, Itskhoki and Rigobon (2010); Amiti, Itskhoki and Konings (2014); Burstein and Gopinath (2015)).
For much of this paper, we focus on flexible prices or PCP as the basic cases. As shown in Lemma 4 above, our qualitative analysis can easily accommodate a somewhat more limited pass-through of exchange rate changes to local prices of
internationally traded goods.

25

In the most basic model, the different interest rates arise from different rates of time preferences,
such that R = β−1 and R∗ = β∗−1 . Without loss of generality, assume R < R∗ so that the Dollar
is the “funding” currency, and the Yen the “investment” currency. The return of the carry trade is:
Rc ≡

R ∗ e1
R e0

c

− 1. For notational convenience we define the carry trade expected return as R ≡ E[ Rc ].

The calculations in Proposition 3 allow us to immediately derive the equilibrium carry trade.
Proposition 6. Assume ξ t = 1. The expected return to the carry trade in the basic Gamma model is:
c

R =

(23)

R∗
R E [ι1 ] − ι0
Γ
,
∗
( R∗ + Γ) ι0 + RR E [ι1 ]

where

Γ = γ var (ι1 )α .

Hence the carry trade return is bigger (i) when the return differential R∗ /R is larger (ii) when the funding
country is a net foreign creditor (iii) when finance is more imperfect (higher Γ).
To gain further intuition on the above result, consider first the case where ι0 = E [ι1 ]. The first order

approximation to R in the case of a small interest rate differential R∗ − R is: R =

> 0, so that the profitability of the carry trade increases the

more limited the risk-bearing capacity of the financiers and the larger the interest rate differential.35
The effects of broadly defined “global risk aversion”, here proxied by Γ, on the profitability of
the carry trade have been central to the empirical analysis of for example Brunnermeier, Nagel and
Pedersen (2009); Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (2011), and Lettau, Maggiori and Weber (2014).
Here we have shown that the carry trade is more profitable the lower the risk bearing capacity of the
financiers; we next formally account for shocks to such capacity in the form of a stochastic Γ.
In addition to a pure carry force due to the interest rate differential, our model features global
imbalances as a separate risk factor in currency risk premia. The reader should recall Proposition 2
that showed how net-external-debtor countries’ currencies have a positive excess return and depreciate whenever risk bearing capacity decreases (↑ Γ). This effect occurs even if both countries have
the same interest rate, thus being theoretically separate from the pure carry trade. Della Corte, Riddiough and Sarno (2014) test these theoretical predictions and find evidence of a global imbalance
risk factor in currency excess returns.36
35 The first effect occurs because, given an interest rate differential, expected returns to the carry trade have to increase
whenever the risk bearing capacity of the financiers goes down to induce them to intermediate financial flows. The second
effect occurs because, given a level of risk bearing capacity for the financiers, an increase in the interest rate differential will
not be offset one to one by the expected exchange rate change due to the risk premium.
36 Notice that we built the model so that financial forces have no effect on the interest rates and the exchange rate makes

26

The exposure of the carry trade to financial disruptions

We now expand on the risks of the carry

trade by studying a three period (t = 0, 1, 2) model with stochastic shocks to the financiers’ risk
bearing capacity in the middle period. To keep the analysis streamlined, we take period 2 to be the
“long run”. Intuitively, period 2 will be a long-run steady state where countries have zero net foreign
assets and run a zero trade balance. This allows us to quickly focus on the short-to-medium-run
exchange rate dominated by financial forces and the long-run exchange rate completely anchored by
fundamentals. We jump into the analysis, and provide many of the background details of this model
in the appendix.37
We assume that time-1 financial conditions, Γ1 , are stochastic. In the 3-period economy with a
long-run last period, the equilibrium exchange rates are:

e0 =

Recall that the carry-trade return between period 0 and 1 is: Rc ≡

e2 = ι 2 .

− 1. Interestingly, in this

case the carry trade also has “exposure to financial conditions”. Notice that

∂e1
∂Γ1

< 0 in the equations

above, so that the Dollar (the funding currency) appreciates whenever there is a negative shock to
the financiers’ risk bearing capacity (↑ Γ1 , ↓ e1 ). Since in our chosen parametrization the carry trade
is short Dollar and long Yen, we correspondingly have:

∂Rc
∂Γ1

< 0, the carry trade does badly whenever

there is a negative shock to the financiers’ risk bearing capacity (↑ Γ1 ). This is consistent with the
intuition and the empirical findings in Brunnermeier, Nagel and Pedersen (2009); we obtain this
effect here in the context of an equilibrium model. We formalize and prove the results obtained so far
in the proposition below.

all the adjustment; while this sharpens the model, we could extend the framework to allow for effects of imbalances on
both the exchange rate and interest rates.

The Fama Regression The classic UIP regression of Fama (1984) is in levels:38
e1 − e0
= α + β UIP ( R − R∗ ) + ε 1 .
e0
Under UIP, we would find β UIP = 1. However, a long empirical literature finds β UIP < 1, and
sometimes even β UIP < 0. The proposition below rationalizes these findings in the context of our
model.
Proposition 8. (Fama regression and market conditions) The coefficient of the Fama regression is β UIP =
1+ Γ1 − Γ0
.
(1+ Γ0 ) ( 1+ Γ1 )

Therefore one has β UIP < 1 whenever Γ0 > 0. In addition, one has β UIP < 0 if and only if

Γ1 + 1 < Γ0 , i.e. if risk bearing capacity is very low in period 0 compared to period 1.
Intuitively financial market imperfections always lead to β UIP < 1 and very bad current market
imperfections compared to future ones lead to β UIP < 0. This occurs because any positive Γ leads
to a positive risk premium on currencies that the financiers are long of and hence to a deviation
from UIP (β UIP < 1). If, in addition, financial conditions are particularly worse today compared to
tomorrow the risk premium is so big as to induce currencies that have temporarily high interest rates
to appreciate on average (β UIP < 0).
The intuition for β UIP < 1 is as follows. In the language of Fama (1984), when Japan has high
interest rates, the risk premium on the Yen is high. The reason is that the risk premium is not entirely
eliminated by financiers, who have limited risk-bearing capacity. In the limit where finance is eliminated (Γ = ∞), an interest rate of 1% translate one-for-one into a risk premium of 1% (β UIP = 0). If
riskiness (assuming α > 0) or financial frictions go to 0, then β UIP goes to 1.39 In all cases, Covered
38 The regression is most commonly performed in its logarithmic approximation version, but the levels prove more convenient for our theoretical treatment without loss of economic content.
39 As riskiness (var ( e ) , var ( e )) goes to 0, Γ and Γ go to 0, so β

UIP goes to 1.

Interest Rate Parity (CIP) holds in the model. This is because we allow financiers to eliminate all
riskless arbitrages. Online Appendix Section A.3.C) provides full details on arbitrage trading in our
model. There, we formulate a version of our basic demand (equation (10)), that applies to an arbitrary
number of assets, and is arbitrage-free. One corollary of that extension is that CIP is respected.

Exchange Rate Excess Volatility In the data exchange rates are more volatile than fundamentals, a
fact often referred to as exchange rate excess volatility. The Gamma model helps to rationalize this
volatility not only by directly introducing new sources of variation, for example shocks to the risk
bearing capacity of the financiers (γt ) and gross flows ( f t ), but also indirectly by endogenously amplifying fundamental volatility via the financial constraints. The intuition is that higher fundamental
volatility tightens financial constraints, tighter constraints lead to higher volatility, thus generating a
self-reinforcing feedback loop. We formalize this more subtle effect in the Lemma below and sharpen
it by not only maintaining the assumption that ξ t = 1 at all dates, but also by considering the case of
deterministic (γt ), so that the only source of volatility is fundamental, and no information revelation
about future shocks E1 [ι2 ] = E0 [ι2 ] and Var1 [ι2 ] = Var0 [ι2 ].
Lemma 5. (Endogenous Amplification of Volatility) The volatility of the exchange rate at time one is:
2

var (e1 ) = 1+Γ1Γ1 var (ι1 ), where Γ1 = γ1 var (ι2 )α . If α > 0 and γ1 > 0, then fundamental volatility is
endogenously amplified by the financial constraint:

∂var (e1 )

∂var (e1 )
∂var (ι2 )

= 0.

Foreign Exchange Rate Intervention

The Gamma model of exchange rates considered so far has emphasized the central role of financial
forces and in particular capital flows in the determination of exchange rates. We study here one very
prominent type of flow: currency intervention by the official sector (the central bank or the treasury
department).
Large-scale currency interventions have recently been undertaken by the governments of Switzerland and Israel.40 Both governments aimed to relieve their currency appreciation in the face of turmoil in financial markets. By most accounts, the interventions successfully weakened the exchange
rate and boosted the real economy.41 Empirical studies, however, have yet to confront the thorny
40 The Czech Republic also intervened in the currency market in November 2013 with the aim of depreciating the Koruna
to boost the domestic economy
41 Israel central bank governor Stanley Fisher remarked: “I have no doubt that the massive purchases [of foreign ex-

29

issue of endogeneity of the policy and future empirical work is necessary to provide a full empirical
assessment.42
Here we focus on proving a framework to understand under which conditions foreign exchange
rate intervention can be a powerful tool to combat exchange rate movements generated by financial
turmoil. The limited risk bearing capacity of the financiers in our model is at the core of the effects
of FX intervention on exchange rates. Indeed, Backus and Kehoe (1989) show that in a general class
of models in which currencies are imperfect substitutes due to risk premia, but in which importantly
there are no financial frictions, FX interventions have no effect on the exchange rate.
For notational simplicity, we set most parameters at 1: e.g. ι0 = ξ t = at = a0∗ = β = β∗ = 1.
We allow ι1 to be stochastic (keeping E [ι1 ] = 1, and setting a1∗ = ι1 for symmetry) so that currency
trading is risky.
At time 0, the Japanese government intervenes in the currency market vis-à-vis the financiers: it
buys q∗ dollars and sells q∗ /e0 yen. By Proposition 4 we immediately obtain the result below (as the
government creates a flow f ∗ = q∗ in the currency market):
Lemma 6. If the Japanese government buys q∗ dollars and sells q∗ /e0 yen at time 0, the exchange rates satisfy
: e0 = 1 −

Γ
∗
2+ Γ q ,

and e1 = 1 +

Γ
∗
2+ Γ q

+ {ι1 }, with Γ = γ var (ι1 )α .

The intervention has no impact on the average exchange rate: e0 + E[e1 ] = 1 irrespective of q∗ . The
intervention induces a depreciation at time 0, and an appreciation at time 1. We call this effect the
“boomerang effect”. A currency intervention can change the level of the exchange rate in a given
period, but not the average level of the exchange rate over multiple periods. Lemma 6 highlights
the importance of the frictions: if Γ = 0, a frictionless set-up analogous to that in Backus and Kehoe
(1989), there is no effect of the intervention on the exchange rate. Correspondingly, the potency of
the intervention is strictly increasing in the severity of the frictions: the higher the Γ the more the
exchange rate moves for a given size of the intervention.
A classic criticism of portfolio balance models is that only extremely big interventions are effective because for an intervention to be effective it needs to alter very large stocks of assets: either
change] we made between July 2008 and into 2010 [...] had a serious effect on the exchange rate which I think is part of the
reason that we succeeded in having a relatively short recession.” Levinson (2010)
42 Blanchard, de Carvalho Filho and Adler (2014) find empirical support for the efficacy of this policy. An earlier skeptical
empirical literature, that mostly focused on interventions of considerable smaller size, is summarized by Sarno and Taylor
(2001). Dominguez and Frankel (1993a,b) find empirical support for the effect of foreign exchange rate intervention via a
portfolio balance channel.

30

the entire stock of assets outstanding or the country level gross external assets and liabilities. In
our framework interventions are more effective because they need only alter Q, the balance sheet of
financiers, which is potentially substantially smaller than the entire stock of assets.
Our framework also sheds light on the real consequence of FX intervention on output and risksharing. We assume that in the short run, i.e. period t = 0, Japanese tradables’ prices are sticky
in domestic currency (PCP) as in Section II.E; prices are flexible in the long run, i.e. period t = 1.
We postulate that at time zero the price is downward rigid at a level p∗F that is sufficiently high
as to cause unemployment in the Japanese tradable sector. US tradable prices are assumed to be
flexible. This captures a situation in which one country is in a recession, with high slack capacity and
unemployment, so much so that its output is demand driven.
Proposition 9. (FX intervention) Assume that Γ > 0 and that at time zero Japanese tradable goods’ prices
are downward rigid at a price p∗F that is sufficiently high to cause unemployment in the Japanese tradable
sector. A Japanese government currency intervention, whereby the government buys q∗ ∈ [0, q∗ ] worth of
Dollar bonds and sells q∗ /e0 yen bonds at time zero, depreciates the Yen and increases Japanese output. q∗ is
the smallest intervention that restores full employment in Japan. The intervention distorts consumption with
the consumption shares determined by:

∗
CH,t
L

= s∗t and

CF,t
YF,t

= 1 − s∗t with s∗t =

et
1+ e t

for t = 0, 1.

Note that there are two preconditions for this intervention analysis. The first one is that prices
are sticky (fixed) in the short run at a level that generates a fall in aggregate demand and induces an
equilibrium output below the economy’s potential. This condition, i.e. being in a demand driven state
of the world, is central to the Keynesian analysis where a depreciation of the exchange rate leads
to an increase in output via an increase in export demand. If this condition is satisfied a first order
output loss would occur even in a world of perfect finance. The second precondition is that financial
markets are imperfect, i.e. Γ > 0. Recall from Lemma 6 that the ability of the government to affect
the time-zero exchange rate is inversely proportional to Γ. When markets are frictionless (Γ = 0) the
government FX policy has no effect on the time-zero exchange rate, even if prices are sticky, because
financiers would simply absorb the intervention without requiring a compensation for the resulting
risk.
The intervention has two distinct effects on consumption. The first effect is an increase in world
consumption because, as described above, the intervention expands Japanese output without decreasing US output. The second effect is a distortion in the share of world output consumed by
31

each country. Both effects are clearly illustrated by the Japanese consumption of Japanese tradable
goods:43
∗

The term

is the equilibrium share of Japanese tradables consumed by Japanese households. The

intervention reduces this share via a Dollar appreciation (e0 ↓). At the same time, the intervention
increases total Japanese output by reducing slack: the term

output is demand driven. The functional specifications of the model (logarithmic utility and linear

will induce an expected increase in the consumption next period (E[CF,1

tradable goods increases at time zero, due both to an increase in US share of world consumption and
an increase in output, but then falls at time 1.
Overall the intervention boosts world output with the cost of intertemporal distortions in consumption. Interestingly, the suggested policy is not of the beggar thy neighbor type: the Japense currency intervention, even with its aim to weaken the Yen, actually increases consumption, at least in
the short run, in the US. The US benefits from an increase in Japanese output with no loss of US
output. We highlight that currency wars can only occur when both countries are in a slump and the
post-intervention weaker Yen causes a first order output loss in the US.44
The intervention has real effects even in this calibration that has been chosen so that before the
intervention households have no incentives to trade in financial markets even if they were allowed to
do so freely and optimally. Similarly, the financiers have no incentives to trade at equilibrium prices
both before and after the intervention.45 To further isolate the sole effect of financial frictions on the
intervention outcome, we have assumed that the intervention’s proceeds and losses are rebated lump
sum (i.e. non-distortionary) by the Japanese government to its citizens.

43 The

first equality follows from the demand function of Japanese households for Japanese tradables (CF,t =

a∗t
p∗F,t ),

the

second equality follows from the equilibrium output function of Japanese tradables in Section II.E.
44 Cavallino (2014) builds on this analysis and analyzes the joint use of FX intervention and monetary policy.
45 Indeed, in this economy (before the government intervention) the exchange rate is at 1, and is expected to remain
at 1 on average, therefore financiers optimally choose to not trade at all. Similarly US household are on their “shadow"
Euler equation and would not want to trade Yen bonds even if allowed to do so. Japanese household would have a small
incentive to trade since their shadow Euler equation has a Jensen inequality term (an additional term compared to the
US household Euler equation). After the intervention, financiers still have no further incentives to trade having already
optimized their positions in response to the intervention. Of course, household would now like to trade but these unlimited
optimal trades are not possible (here as in the rest of the model) due to the frictions in the intermediation process. Therefore
the policy success relies on the presence of financial frictions rather than a direct failure of Ricardian equivalence.

32

The Potency of Intervention: Combining FX Intervention and Capital Controls

It is often argued

by policy markers that currency intervention should be undertaken together with capital controls.
The Gamma model provides a unified view of this policy combination because capital controls increase the financial market segmentation thus enhancing the potency of currency intervention.
We introduce a second policy instrument, taxation of the financiers, which is a form of capital
controls.46 We consider a proportional (Japanese) government tax on each financier’s profits; the tax
proceeds are rebated lump sum to financiers as a whole. Recall the imperfect intermediation problem
in Section II.B, we now assume that the after-tax value of the intermediary is Vt (1 − τ ), where τ is
the tax rate. The financiers’ optimality condition, derived in a manner entirely analogous to the

below.
Proposition 10. Assume ξ t is deterministic, a tax τ on finance is equivalent to lowering the financiers’ risk
 α
bearing capacity by increasing Γ to Γeff ≡ 1−Γ τ = 1−γ τ var ξι11 . A higher tax increases the effective Γeff , thus
reducing the financiers’ risk bearing capacity. The sign of the effect of the tax on exchange rates depends on
the position that the financiers would have taken absent the tax (Q− ): if the financiers are long (short) dollars
Q− > 0 (Q− < 0), then a tax depreciates (appreciates) the Dollar. The potency of FX intervention increases
in the tax.
First we note that if the equilibrium before the government intervention features zero risk taking by the financiers (Q0 = 0), as was the case in the economy studied in the previous analysis of
FX intervention, then the tax τ is entirely ineffective. Intuitively, this occurs because there are zero
expected profits to tax, and therefore the tax has no effect on ex-ante incentives.
More generally we recall from Proposition 2 that an increase in Γ, in this case an increase in
Γeff due to an increase in τ, has the opposite effect on the exchange rate depending on whether the
financiers are long or short the Dollar to start with, i.e. depending on the sign of Q0 before the
tax is imposed. For example, the tax would make the Dollar depreciate on impact if the financiers
were long dollars to start with (Q0 > 0), but the same tax would make the Dollar appreciate if the

financiers had the opposite position to start with. In practice this means that policy makers who are
considering imposing capital controls, or otherwise taxing international finance, should pay close
attention to the balance sheets of financial institutions that have exposures to their currency. Basing
the policy on reduced form approaches or purely on traditional macroeconomics fundamentals can
not only be misguiding, but might actually generate the opposite outcome for the exchange rate from
the desired one. Finally, recall from Lemma 6 that the effect of currency intervention on the exchange
rate is bigger the lower the financiers’ risk bearing capacity (the higher the Γ). It follows that a tax on
finance or a capital control, by implicitly reducing risk bearing capacity, increases the potency of FX
intervention.

A NALYTICAL G ENERALIZATION OF THE M ODEL

The basic version of the Gamma model presented so far was real, and we now show that it can readily
be extended to a nominal version where the nominal exchange rate is determined, similarly to our
baseline model, in an imperfect financial market.47
We assume that money is only used domestically by the households and that its demand is captured, in reduced form, in the utility function of households in each country.48 Financiers do not
use money, but they trade in nominal bonds denominated in the two currencies. The US consumption basket is now extended to include a real money balances component such that the consumption

Money is the numéraire in each economy, with local currency price equal to 1. The static utility
maximization problem is entirely similar to the one in the basic Gamma model in Section II.A, and
standard optimization arguments lead to demand functions: Mt =

ωt
λt ;

p NT,t CNT,t =

p F,t CF,t =

47 Notice that we have indeed set up the “real” model in the main text in such a way that non-tradables in each country
play a role very similar to money and where, therefore, the exchange rate is rather similar to a nominal exchange rate (see
Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996)[Ch. 8.3]). In this section we make such analogy more explicit. Online Appendix A.1.D provides
a full discussion of the CPI-based real exchange rate and the nominal exchange rate in our model. Alvarez, Atkeson and
Kehoe (2009) provide a model of nominal exchange rates with frictions in the domestic money markets, while our model
has frictions in the international capacity to bear exchange-rate risk.
48 A vast literature has focused on foundations of the demand for money; such foundations are beyond the scope of
this paper and consequently we focus on the simplest approach that delivers a plausible demand for money and much
tractability.

where, we recall from earlier sections, λt is the Lagrange multiplier on the households’ static

budget constraint.49 Substituting for the value of the Lagrange multiplier, money demand is given
by Mt = ωt Pt Ct and is proportional to total nominal consumption expenditures; the coefficient of
proportionality, ωt , is potentially stochastic.50
Let us define mt ≡

Mts
ωt

and m∗t ≡

Mts∗
ωt∗ ,

where Mts and Mts∗ are the money supplies.51 Notice that

since money (as in actual physical bank notes) is non-tradable across countries or with the financiers
(but bonds that pay in units of money are tradable with the financiers as in the previous sections), the
money market clearing implies that the central bank can pin down the level of nominal consumption

). The nominal exchange rate et is the relative price of the two

currencies. It is defined as the strength of the Yen, so that an increase in et is a Dollar depreciation.53
US nominal imports in dollars are: p F,t CF,t =

= ι t mt . Similarly, Japanese demand for US

50 The money demand equation is similar to that of a cash in advance constraint where money is only held by the consumers within the period, i.e. they need to have enough cash at the beginning of the period to carry out the planned period
consumption. For constraints of this type see Helpman (1981); Helpman and Razin (1982).
51 It is often convenient to consider the cashless limit of our economies by taking the limit case when { M s , M s∗ , ω , ω ∗ } ↓ 0

such that {mt , m∗t } are finite; however, this is not needed for positive analysis.
52 The central bank in each period choses money supply after the preference shocks are realized so that m and m∗ are
policy variables. We abstract here from issues connected with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Notice the
duality between money in the current setup and non-tradable goods in the basic Gamma model of Section II. If Mt = ωt
and CNT,t = χt , one recovers the equations in Section II, because the demand for money implies λt = 1, in which case the
demand for non-tradables implies that p NT,t = 1.
53 To keep simpler notations, we denote the nominal exchange rate by e , the same symbol used for the exchange rate in
t
the basic Gamma model.
54 When we consider setups that are more general than the basic Gamma model of Section II, we maintain the simpler
formulation of the financiers’ demand function. We do not directly derive the households’ valuation of currency trades
in these more general setups. Our demand functions are very tractable and carry most of the economic content of more
general treatments; we leave it for the extension Section A.4 to characterize numerically financier value functions more
complex than those analyzed in closed form here.

Equilibrium Exchange Rate in the Extended Setup.

When we include all the extensions to the basic

Gamma model considered so far, the key equations to solve for the equilibrium nominal exchange
rate are the flow equations in the international bond market:

Equations 25-26 allow for household trading of foreign currency. They extend Section II.D.1,
that only considered liquidity/noise trading, by allowing these demand functions for foreign bonds
to depend on all fundamentals, but not directly depend on the exchange rate.56 Equations 25-26
also allow for each country to start with a stock of foreign assets and liabilities. The US net foreign
liabilities in dollars are DUS and Japan net foreign liabilities in yen are D J .57
m∗

constraint Γ = γvar (e1 )α can become Γ = γvar (e1 m11 )α , to make the model invariant to predictable changes to
money supply.
56 We allow the demand functions for foreign bonds from US and Japanese households, denoted by f and f ∗ respectively,
to depend on all present and expected future fundamentals. We use the shorthand notation f and f ∗ to denote the generic
functions: f ( R, R∗ , ι, ξ, ...) and f ∗ ( R, R∗ , ι, ξ, ...). For example, demand functions that load on a popular trading strategy,
the carry trade, that invests in high interest rate currencies while funding the trade in low interest rate currencies can be
expressed as f = b + c( R − R∗ ) and f ∗ = d + g( R − R∗ ), for some constants b, c, d, g. Interestingly, both gross capital flows
and trade flows could be ultimately generated by financial frictions (see Antràs and Caballero (2009)). Dekle, Hyeok and
Kiyotaki (2014) employ the reduced form approach and put holdings of foreign bonds directly in the utility function of
domestic agents to generate flows. The online appendix extends the present results to demand functions that depend on
the exchange rate directly by solving the model numerically.
57 We could have alternatively assumed that only a fraction η of the debt had to be intermediated in which case we would

generalizing the analysis in Section II.
Proposition 11. In the richer model above (with money, portfolio flows, external debt, and shocks to imports
and exports) the values for the exchange rates e0 and e1 are those in Proposition 3, replacing imports (ι t ),
e}, defined as: eι0 ≡
exports (ξ t ), and the risk bearing capacity (Γ) by their “pseudo” counterparts {eι t , ξet , Γ

Proof: Equations (25)-(26) reduce to the basic flow equations, equations (13)-(14), provided we
replace ι t and ξ t by eι t and ξet . Similarly, equation (27) reduces to equation (10), provided we replace Γ
e Then the result follows from the proof of Proposition 3.
by Γ.
Intuitively, the pseudo imports (eι) are composed of factors that lead consumers and firms to sell
dollars and hence “force” financiers to be long the Dollar. An entirely symmetric intuition applies to
 
the pseudo exports ξe .
We collect here a number of qualitative results for the generalized economy. While some properties do not strictly depend on Γ > 0 and therefore can be derived even in UIP models, it is nonetheless
convenient to provide a unified treatment in the present model. We assume that eι t and ξet are positive at dates 0 and 1. Otherwise, various pathologies can happen, including the non-existence of an
equilibrium (e.g. formally, a negative exchange rate).
Proposition 12. The Dollar is weaker: 1) (Imports-Exports) when US import demand for Japanese goods
(ι t ) is higher; when Japanese import demand for US goods (ξ t ) is lower; 2) (“Myopia” from an imperfect
financial system) higher Γ increases the effects in point 1) by making current imports matter more than
future imports;58 3) (Debts and their currency denomination) when US net external liabilities in dollars
(DUS ) are higher; when Japanese net external liabilities in Yen (D J ) are lower; 4) (Financiers’ risk-bearing
capacity) when financial conditions are worse (Γ is higher), conditional on Japan being a net creditor at time
0+ (N0+ < 0); 5) (Demand pressure) when the noise demand for the Dollar ( f ∗ ) is lower, as long as Γ > 0;
6) (Interest rates) when the US real interest rate is lower; when the Japanese real interest rate is higher; 7)
(Money supply) when the US current money supply (m0 ) is higher; when the Japanese current money supply
get a flow of ηD at time zero and a flow (1 − η ) RD at time 1.
58 That is, ∂e /∂ι and ∂e /∂ι are positive and respectively increasing and decreasing in Γ.

(m0∗ ) is lower.
Point 3 above highlights a valuation channel to the external adjustments of countries. The exchange
rate moves in a way that facilitates the re-equilibration of external imbalances. Interestingly, it is not
just the net-external position of a country, its net foreign assets, that matters for external adjustment,
but actually the (currency) composition of its gross external assets and liabilities (DUS and D J ). This
basic result is consistent with the valuation channel to external adjustment highlighted in Gourinchas
and Rey (2007a,b); Lane and Shambaugh (2010).

V

C ONCLUSION

We presented a theory of exchange rate determination in imperfect capital markets where financiers
bear the risks resulting from global imbalances in the demand and supply of international assets.
Exchange rates are determined by the balance sheet risks and risk bearing capacity of these financiers.
Exchange rates in our model are disconnected from traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, such
as output, inflation and the trade balance and are instead more connected to financial forces such as
the demand for assets denominated in different currencies. Our model is tractable, with simple to
derive closed form solutions, and can be generalized to address a number of both classic and new
issues in international macroeconomic analysis.

A PPENDIX
The financiers’ optimization problem. We clarify here the role of the mild assumption, made in
footnote 15, that 1 ≥ Ω0 ≥ −1. Formally, the financiers’ optimization problem is:




R ∗ e1
| q0 |
max V0 = Ω0 q0 , subject to V0 ≥ min 1, Γ
.
|q0 | , where Ω0 ≡ E 1 −
q0
e0
R e0
Notice that Ω0 is unaffected by the individual financier’s decisions and can be thought of as exogenous in this constrained maximization problem.
Consider the case in which Ω0 > 0, then the optimal choice of investment has q0 ∈ (0, ∞). Notice
q2

that Ω0 ≤ 1 trivially. Then one has V0 ≤ q0 . In this case, the constraint can be rewritten as: V0 ≥ Γ e00 ,
|q |

because the constraint will always bind before the portion of assets that the financiers can divert Γ e00
reaches 1. This yields the simpler formulation of the constraint adopted in the main text.
Now consider the case in which Ω0 < 0, then the optimal choice of investment has q0 ∈ (−∞, 0).
It is a property of currency excess returns that Ω0 has no lower bound. In this paper, we assume
38

that the parameters of the model are as such that Ω0 > −1, i.e. we assume that the worst possible
(discounted) expected returns from being long a Dollar bond and being short a Yen bond is -100%.
Economically this is an entirely innocuous assumption given that the range of expected excess returns
in the data is approximately [-6%,+6%]. With this assumption in hand we have V0 ≤ |q0 |, and hence
we can once again adopt the simpler formulation of the constraint because the constraint will always
|q |
bind before the portion of assets that the financiers can divert Γ e00 reaches 1.
As pointed out in the numerical generalization section of the Online Appendix (Section A.4),
more general (and non-linear) value functions would apply once the simplifying assumptions made
in the text are removed and depending on who the financiers’ repatriate their profit and losses to. In
the main body of the paper, we maintain the assumption that the financiers’ use the US household
valuation criterion; this makes the model most tractable while very little economic content is lost.
The numerical generalizations in the online appendix provide robustness checks by solving the nonlinear cases.

F URTHER D ETAILS FOR THE M AIN B ODY OF THE PAPER

A More Abstract Version of the Market Structure

It may be useful to have a more abstract presentation of the basic model. We focus on the US side, as the
Japanese side is entirely symmetric.
For generality, we present the monetary model, and then show how the real model can be viewed as a
special case of it. We call
c = (CH , CF , CNT , M, 0, 0) ,
the vector of consumptions of CH US tradables, CF Japanese tradables, CNT US non-tradables, and a quantity M of US money, respectively. The last 2 slots in vector c (set at 0) are the consumption of Japanese
non-tradables, and Japanese money: they are zero for the US consumer. Likewise, the Japanese consumer
has consumption:
∗
∗
c∗ = (C H
, CF∗ , 0, 0, CNT
, M∗ ) .
∗ US tradables, C ∗ Japanese tradables, 0 US non-tradables, 0 US
The Japanese household consumes CH
F
∗
money, CNT Japanese non-tradables, and M∗ Japanese money.
The US production vector is
y = (y H , 0, y NT , Ms , 0, 0) .

This shows that the US produces y H US tradables, 0 Japanese tradables, y NT US non-tradables, and 0
Japanese non-tradables and money. Here Ms is the money supply given by the government to the household. Japanese production is similarly
y∗ = (0, y∗F , 0, 0, y∗NT , Ms∗ ) .
The vector of prices in the US is
p = ( p H , p F , p NT , 1, 0, 0) .
Utility is u (ct , φt ), where φt is a taste shock. In the paper, φt = ( at , ι t , χt , ωt , 0, 0), so that in the utility
function is
6

u (ct , φt ) =

∑ φit ln cit , for t = 0, . . . , T.

i =1

Consumptions are non-negative, cit ≥ 0 for all i, t.
The fourth and sixth components of the above vectors correspond to money. In the real model they are
set to 0. Then, in this
the numéraire is the non-tradable good, so that p NT = 1.
 real model,

J

We call Θt = ΘUS
t , Θt the holding by the US of US bonds and Japanese bonds, Pt = (1, et ) the price
of bonds in dollars.
The US consumers’ problem is:

s.t.

A.1

pt · (yt − ct ) + Pt · Dt Θt−1 + πtF = Pt · Θt , for t = 0, ..., T,

(A.2)
and

Θ T = 0.

(A.3)

Here Dt = diag ( R, R∗ ) is the diagonal matrix expressing the gross rate of return of bonds in each
currency and πtF is a profit rebated by financiers. The left-hand side of (A.2) is the households’ financial
wealth (in dollars) after period t. US firms are fully owned by US households. Because the economy is
fully competitive, they make no profit. The entire production comes as labor income, whose value is pt · yt .
The budget constraint is the terminal asset holdings should be 0, which is expressed by (A.3). Finally, as is
usual, ct and ΘUS
t are adapted process, i.e. they depend only on information available at date t.
In the above maximization problems, US consumers choose optimally their consumption vector ct and
J
their dollar bond holdings ΘUS
t . However, they do not choose their holding of Japanese bonds Θt optimally.
J
In the basic model we preclude such holdings and set Θt = 0. In the extended model, we allow for such
holdings and study simple and intuitive cases: for instance, at time 0 the holdings of Japanese bonds can be
J
an endowment Θ−1 = D J (or Japanese debt denoted in Yen). Alternatively, they could be a liquidity (noise
J

trader) shock Θ0 = − f , or we could have f be a function of observables, but not the exchange rate directly,
e.g. f = b + c ( R − R∗ ) for a carry-trader. We do not focus on the foundations for each type of demand, but
actually take the demands as exogenously specified. Possible microfoundations for these demands range
from rational models of portfolio delegation where the interest rate is an observable variable that is known,
in equilibrium, to load on the sources of risk of the model (see Section III.A), to models of “reaching for
yield" (Hanson and Stein, 2014), or to the “boundedly rational” households who focus on the interest rate
when investing without considering future exchange rate changes or covariance with marginal utility (as
in Gabaix (2014)).
To summarize, while all goods are frictionlessly traded within a period (with the non-tradable goods
being traded only within a country), asset markets are restricted: only US and Japanese bonds are traded
(rather than a full set of Arrow-Debreu securities).
The goods market clearing condition is:
yt + y∗t = ct + c∗t at all dates t ≤ T.

(A.4)

Firms produce and repatriate their sales at every period. They have net asset flows,

The first equation expresses the asset flows of US exporters: in Japan, they have sales of p∗Ht c∗Ht Yen in Japan
market; they repatriate those yens (hence a flow of − p∗Ht c∗Ht in Yen), to buy dollars (hence a flow of p∗Ht c∗Ht et
dollars).
For instance, in the model with the log specification,

so that Θt

The gross demand by financiers is Qt (1, −1/et ). Each period the financiers sell the previous period

Qt (1, −1/et ) − Dt Qt−1 (1, −1/et−1 ) = (1 − Dt L) Qt (1, −1/et ) ,

(A.5)

where L is the lag operator, L Xt = Xt−1 .
Financiers choose Qt optimally, given the frictions, as in the main body of the paper and we do not
restate their problem here for brevity. In the last period, holdings are 0, i.e. Q T = 0.
The asset market clearing condition is that the net demand for bonds is 0

(A.6)

f irms,∗

+ Θt

+ (1 − Dt L) (Θt + Θ∗t + Qt (1, −1/et )) = 0.

For instance, for consumers, (1 − Dt L) Θt is the increased asset demand by the agent. To gain some intuition, the first coordinate of equation (A.6), evaluated at time t = 0, in the case where Θt = Θ∗t = 0, gives
equation (25) of the paper:
ξ 0 e0 m0∗ − ι0 m0 + Q0 = 0;
and in the real case (corresponding to m0 = m0∗ = 1), we obtain the basic equation (13) of the paper:
ξ 0 e0 − ι0 + Q0 = 0.
We now state formally the definition of equilibrium in the case of flexible prices. Recall that we assume the
law of one price in goods market to hold such that:
p∗Ht = p Ht /et , p∗Ft = p Ft /et .

Definition A competitive equilibrium consists of allocations ct , c∗t , Θt , Θ∗t , Θt

, Qt , prices pt , p∗t ,
exchange rate et , for t = 0, . . . , T such that the US consumers optimize their utility function (A.1) under the
above constraints (A.2-A.3), Japanese consumers optimize similarly, goods markets clear (A.4), and asset
markets clear (A.6), and the law of one price (A.7) holds.

(A.7)

As explained in the paper (Lemma 4), if we use local currency pricing (i.e. change (A.7), and replace
the value of p∗Ht and p Ft by other, potentially arbitrary, values), the equilibrium value of the exchange rate
does not change (though consumptions do change).
The timing was already stated in the paper, but for completeness we restate it here. At time 0, producers produce, consumers demand and consume, exporters repatriate their sales, financiers take their
FX positions, and asset and goods market clear (simultaneously, like in Arrow-Debreu). The potential diversion by the financiers happens at time 0+ , right after time 0 (of course, no diversion happens on the
equilibrium path). Then, at time 1 and potentially future periods, the same structure is repeated (with no
financiers’ position in the last period).

The Euler Equation when there are Several Goods

We state the general Euler equation when there are several goods.
With utility ut (Ct ) + βut+1 (Ct+1 ), where Ct is the vector of goods consumed (for instance, Ct =
(CNT,t , CH,t , CF,t ) in our setup), if the consumer is at his optimum, we have:
Lemma A.1. When there are several goods, the Euler equation is:

for all i, j.

This should be understood in “nominal” terms, i.e. the return R is in units of the (potentially arbitrary)
numéraire.
Proof. It is a variant on the usual one: the consumer can consume dε fewer dollars’ worth (assuming
that the “dollar” is the local unit of account) of good i at time t (hence, consume dci,t = − pdε ), invest
i,t
them at rate R, and consume the proceeds, i.e. Rdε more dollars of good j at time t + 1 (hence, consume
dc j,t+1 = pRdε ). The total utility change is:

j,t+1
At the margin, the consumer should be indifferent, so dU = 0, hence (A.8). 
Applying this to our setup, with i = j = NT, with p NT,t = 1 and utc NT,t =

obtain: 1 = E βR 1/1

Price Indices, Nominal and Real Exchange Rates

We explore here the relationship between the nominal and the real CPI-based exchange rate in our framework. The real exchange rate can be defined as the ratio of two broad price levels, one in each country,
expressed in the same numéraire. It is most common to use consumer price indices (CPI) adjusted by the
∗
nominal exchange rate, in which case one has: E ≡ PP e . Notice that a fall in E is a US Dollar real appreciation.
Consider the nominal version of the basic Gamma model in Section IV. Standard calculations reported
below imply that the real CPI-based exchange rate is:

E = θ̃

where θ̃ is a function of exogenous shocks and primed variables are normalized by θ. The above equation
is the most general formulation of the relationship between the CPI-RER and the nominal exchange rate in
the Gamma model.
Let us first derive the price indices { P, P∗ }. The US price index P is defined as the minimum cost, in

Let us define a “primed” variable as being normalized by the sum of the preference coefficients θt ; so that,

for example, χt ≡ χθtt . Substituting the optimal demand for goods (see the first order conditions at the

The CPI-RER in equation (A.9) is then obtained by substituting the price indices above in the definition of

the real exchange rate E ≡ PP e . For completeness, we report below the full expression for the function θ̃

If we impose further assumptions on Equation (A.9), we can derive some useful special cases.

The Basic Gamma Model Assume that ω = ω ∗ = 0 and p NT = p∗NT = 1 so that there is no money

and the numéraire in each economy is the non-tradable good. Recall that in the basic Gamma model of
Section II the law of one price holds for tradables, so we have p H = p∗H e and p F = p∗F e. Equation (A.9)

The Basic Complete Market Model We maintain all the assumptions from the paragraph above on
the Basic Gamma model, except that we now assume markets to be complete and frictionless. Recall from

Notice that while the real exchange rate (e) is constant in complete markets in the basic Gamma model, the
CPI-RER will in general not be constant as long as the CPI baskets are not symmetric and relative prices of
goods move.

The Backus and Smith Condition

In the spirit of re-deriving some classic results of international macroeconomics with the Gamma model,
let us analyze the Backus and Smith condition (Backus and Smith (1993)). Let us first consider the basic
Gamma set-up but with the additional assumption of complete markets as in Lemma 3. Then by equating
marginal utility growth in the two countries and converting, via the exchange rate, in the same units, we

A.5

have:

P0 C0 /θ0
P1 C1 /θ1

=

P0∗ C0∗ /θ0∗ e0
P1∗ C1∗ /θ1∗ e1 .

Re-arranging we conclude:
C ∗ /θ ∗ E
C0 /θ0
= 0∗ 0∗ 0 ,
C1 /θ1
C1 /θ1 E1

(A.10)

∗

where the reader should recall the definition E = PP e . This is the Backus and Smith condition in our set-up
under complete markets: the perfect risk sharing benchmark equation.
Of course, this condition fails in the basic Gamma model because agents not only cannot trade all
Arrow-Debreu claims, but also have to trade with financiers in the presence of limited commitment problems. In our framework (Section II), however, an extended version of this condition holds:
C ∗ /θ ∗ E e
C0 /θ0
= 0∗ 0∗ 0 1 .
C1 /θ1
C1 /θ1 E1 e0

(A.11)

The simple derivation of this result is reported below. The above equation is the extended Backus-Smith
condition that holds in our Gamma model. Notice that our condition in equation (A.11) differs from the
standard Backus-Smith condition in equation (A.10) by the growth rate of the “nominal” exchange rate ee01 .
Since exchange rates are much more volatile in the data than consumption, this omitted term creates an
ample wedge between the complete market and the Gamma version of the Backus-Smith condition.
The condition in equation (A.11) can be verified as follows:
C ∗ /θ ∗ E e
P∗ C ∗ /θ ∗
C0 /θ0
P C /θ

= 0∗ 0∗ 0 1 ⇐⇒ 0 0 0 = 0∗ 0∗ 0∗ ⇐⇒

where the first equivalence simply makes use of the definition E ≡ PP e , and the second equivalence follows
from Pt Ct = θt and Pt∗ Ct∗ = θt∗ for t = 0, 1. These latter equalities (we focus here on the US case) can
be recovered by substituting the households’ demand functions for goods in the static household budget
constraint: Pt Ct = CNT,t + p H,t CH,t + p F,t CF,t = χt + at + ι t = θt .

E XTENSIONS OF THE M ODEL

Japanese Households and the Carry Trade

In most of the main body of the paper, consumers do not do the carry trade themselves. In this subsection,
we extend Proposition 6 by analyzing the case in which Japanese consumers buy a quantity f ∗ of dollar
bonds, financing the purchase by shorting an equivalent amount of Yen bonds. We let this demand take the
form:
f ∗ = b ( R − R∗ ) .
Recall that Proposition 6 assumes R < R∗ , so that if b ≥ 0 the Japanese household demand is a form of
carry trade. The flow equations now are:
NX0 + Q + f ∗ = 0;

NX1 − R ( Q + f ∗ ) = 0.

We summarize the implications for the equilibrium carry trade in the Proposition below.
Proposition A.1. Assume ξ t = 1 for t = 0, 1, R < R∗ and that Japanese consumers do the carry trade in amount
f ∗ , the expected return to the carry trade in the Gamma model is:
c

R =

R∗
E [ ι 1 ] − ι 0 + f ∗ (1 + R ∗ )
Γ R
.
∗
( R∗ + Γ) ι0 + RR E [ι1 ] − Γ f ∗

Hence the carry trade return is bigger: (i) when R∗ /R is higher, (ii) when the funding country is a net foreign creditor,
and (iii) when consumers do the carry trade less ( f ∗ increases).

A.6

If consumers do the carry trade on too large a scale ( f ∗ too negative), then the carry trade becomes
c
unprofitable, R < 0.

A.2.B

Endogenizing the Number of Financiers

In the basic model, there is a fixed quantity of financiers. We now show a possible way to endogenize entry
of financiers. This will confirm that the first order results of the paper are unchanged, except that γ is now
endogenous.

We call Ω = E0 1 − ee10 RR the expected discounted return of currency trading. Suppose that each

and we have G = g (var0 (e1 ))α for a parameter g. Hence g and G are the agent’s γ and Γ. Using Rβ = 1,

In the spirit of Jeanne and Rose (2002), we posit that financiers decide to enter at date −1 (before the values
of ι0 , E0 [ι1 ] are realized, hence before the actual expected currency trading return is known). Potential
financier i enters if and only if E−1 [V0 ] ≥ κi , where κi is a (perhaps psychological) cost drawn from a
distribution with CDF F ( x ) = P (κi ≤ x ). This implies that the mass n of financiers is


n = F E−1 Ω2 e0 var0 (e1 )−α /g .
The aggregate demand at time 0 is then:

Hence, we have a fixed point determining γ, since e0 and e1 depend on γ.

by considerations at time −1.

We note that the government might wish to subsidize entry in the financial sector so to effectively remove
the financial constraint. This is a property common to many models of financial imperfections: for example
if the financiers had limited capital as in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997); Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010); Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014); He and Krishnamurthy (2013), the government would want to recapitalize
them in many states of the world.59 Like those papers, we do not consider the optimal subsidy to financiers.
One reason for this is that in practice, it is difficult as the government might be facing frictions with the financiers such as moral hazard or adverse selection. For example, the government might want to screen for
“smart” FX traders that stabilize FX markets, and not subsidize noise traders, who might actually worsen
the situation (they would be creating f , f ∗ shocks in our model).60

A.2.C

A “Short-Run” Vs “Long-Run” Analysis

As in undergraduate textbooks, it is handy to have a notion of the “long run”. We develop here a way to
introduce it in our model. We have periods of unequal length: we say that period 0 is short, but period “1”
lasts for a length T. The equilibrium flow equations in the dollar-yen market become:
ξ 0 e0 − ι0 + Q0 = 0,
T (ξ 1 e1 − ι1 ) − RQ0 = 0.

(A.15)

The reason for the “T” is that the imports and exports will occur over T periods. We assume a zero interest
rate “within period 1”. This already gives a good notion of the “long run”.61
Some extra simplicity is obtained by taking the limit T → ∞. The interpretation is that period 1 is “very
0
long” and period 0 is “very short”. The flow equation (A.15) can be written: ξ 1 e1 − ι1 − RQ
T = 0. So in the
large T limit we obtain: ξ 1 e1 − ι1 = 0. Economically, it means the trades absorbed by the financiers are very
small compared to the trades in the goods markets in the long run. We summarize the environment and its
solution in the following proposition.62
Proposition A.2. Consider a model with a “long-run”
h last period.
i Then, the flow equations become ξ 0 e0 − ι0 + Q0 =
∗

0 and ξ 1 e1 − ι1 = 0, while we still have Q0 = Γ1 E e0 − e1 RR . The exchange rates become:

e0 =

R∗
R E

h i

;

e1 =

ξ1

In this view, the “long run” is determined by fundamentals e1 = ξι1 , while the “short run” is determined
1
both by fundamentals and financial imperfections (Γ) with short-run considerations (ι0 , ξ 0 ). In the simple
Γι +E[ι ]
case R = R∗ = ξ t = 1, we obtain: e0 = 0Γ+1 1 and e1 = ι1 .

Application to the carry trade with three periods. In the 3-period carry trade model of Section III.A,
we take period 2 to be the “long run”. We assume that in period t = 1 financiers only intermediate the new
flows; stocks arising from previous flows are held passively by the households (long term investors) until
t=2. That allows us to analyze more clearly the dynamic environment. Without the “long-run” period 2,
the expressions are less intelligible, but the economics is the same.
59 We

thank a referee for remarks along these lines.

60 With endogenous entry, the FX intervention considered in Section III.B will also ex ante affect entry, similarly to the

analysis in Jeanne and Rose (2002). We leave this interesting analysis to future research.
61 The solution is simply obtained by Proposition 3, setting e
ι1 = Tι1 , ξe1 = Tξ 1 .
62 One derivation is as follows. Take Proposition 3, set e
ι1 = Tι1 , ξe1 = Tξ 1 , and take the limit T → ∞.

The Fama Regression over Longer Horizons

We take the context of the Fama regresssion in the paper, and now consider the Fama regression over a
2-period horizon:
1 e2 − e0
= α + βU IP,2 ( R − R∗ ) + ε 1
2 e0
i.e. regressing (normalized) the 2-period return on the interest rate differential. We assume that Γ1 is
deterministic.
Lemma A.2. The coefficient βU IP,2 =
βU IP =

1+ Γ1 − Γ0

(1+Γ0 )(1+Γ1 )

1+Γ1 /2

(1+Γ0 )(1+Γ1 )

while the UIP coefficient in a 1-period regression is βU IP,1 ≡

Hence, we have 1 ≥ βU IP,2 as often found empirically. Furthermore, we have βU IP,2 ≥ βU IP,1 if
and only if Γ1 ≤ 2Γ0 . For instance, suppose that Γ1 and Γ0 are drawn from the same distribution. Then,
E [ βU IP,2 ] ≥ E [ βU IP,1 ]: this means that as the horizon expands, the coefficient of the Fama regression is
closer to 1. This is consistent with the empirical evidence that the Fama regression coefficient is higher, and
closer to 1, at long horizons (Chinn and Meredith (2005)).

M ODEL E XTENSIONS : M ULTI -C OUNTRY, M ULTI -A SSET M ODEL ,
AND A DDITIONAL M ATERIAL ON THE VARIANCE IN THE
C ONSTRAINT

We provide below generalizations of the model. In particular, we develop a multi-asset, multi-country
model.

A.3.A

Verification of the tractability of the model when the variance is in the constraint

In the paper, we propose a formulation of Γ = γvar (e1 )α . We verify that it leads to a tractable model in the
core parts of the paper. In this subsection of the appendix, we check that we also keep a tractable model in
a more general model with T periods.
When ξ t is deterministic, the formulation remains tractable. We obtain each Γt in closed form.63 Let us
63 However, when ξ is stochastic, the formulation is more complex. We obtain a fixed point problem not just in Γ
t
0
(like in the 2-period model), but in (Γ0,..., Γ T −1 ).

A.9

work out explicitly a 3-period example. We take ξ t = R = R∗ = 1 for simplicity. The equations are:
e0 − ι0 + Q0 = 0,
e1 − ι1 − Q0 + Q1 = 0,
e2 − ι2 − Q1 = 0,
Et [ e t − e t +1 ]
for t = 0, 1,
Γt
Γt = γ vart (et+1 )α .

Qt =

Notice that the model at t = 1, 2 is like the basic model with 2 periods, except for the pseudo-import term
eι1 = ι1 − Q1 . Hence, we have {e2 } = {ι2 }, and
Γ1 = γσι2α
.

(A.16)

This also implies that (by Proposition 3 applied to (e1 , e2 ) rather than (e0 , e1 )): {e1 } =
gives:

Γ0 = γ

so we endogenize Γ0 . Note that the σι1 is, in general, the variance of pseudo-imports, hence it would include
the volatility due to financial flows. Notice also that fundamental variance is endogenously amplified by the
imperfect financial market: var (e1 ) depends positively on Γ1 , that itself depends positively on fundamental
variance.
The same idea and procedure applies to an arbitrary number of periods, and indeed to the infinite
period model. We could also have correlated innovations in ι t .

A.3.B

A tractable multi-country model

We call eit the exchange rate of country i at date t, with a high eit being an appreciation of country i’s currency
versus the USD. There is a central country 0, for which we normalize e0t = 1 at all dates t. As a short hand,
we call this country “the US”. For i 6= j, call ξ ij < 0 exports of country i to country j (minus the CobbDouglas weight), and xi = −ξ i0 > 0 exports of country i to country 0. Define the import weight as:
ξ ii ≡ −

∑

ξ ji > 0,

j=0,...,n,j6=i

so that ξ ii equals total imports of country i. Call θi the holdings of country i’s bonds by financiers, expressed
in number of bonds: so, the dollar value of those bond holdings is qi ≡ θi ei0 .
Hence, the net demand for currency i in the currency i / USD spot market, expressed in dollars, is:
(A.18)

−

∑ ξ ij0 e0j + xi0 + θi ei0 , = 0,

j 6 =0

and has to be 0 in market equilibrium. Indeed, at time 0 the country imports a dollar value ξ ii0 ei0 , creating a
negative demand −ξ ii0 ei0 for the currency. It also exports a dollar value − ∑ j6=0 ξ ij0 e0j + xi0 (recall that ξ ij < 0
for i 6= j); as those exports are repatriated, they lead to a demand for the currency. Finally, financiers
demand a dollar value θi ei0 of the country’s bonds. Using qi ≡ θi ei0 , equation (A.18) can be rewritten in
vector form:
(A.19)

− ξ 0 e0 + x0 + q = 0.

The flow equation at time t = 1 is (again, net demand for currency i in the dollar-currency i market,

A.10

expressed in dollars):
(A.20)

−

∑ ξ ij1 e1j + xi1 − θi ei1 + Πi = 0

j 6 =0

where Πi is the time-1 rebate of financiers profits to country i. In the first equation, imports enter as −ξ ii0 ei0 <
0, creating a net negative demand for currency i, and exports to other countries enter as − ∑ j6=0,i ξ ij0 e0j > 0.

Total financiers’ profit is: Π ≡ ∑i Πi = ∑i θi ei1 − ei0 . We posit the following rule for the rebate Πi to

country i: Πi = θi ei1 − ei0 . Then, (A.20) becomes: − ∑ j6=0 ξ ij1 e1j + xi1 − θi ei0 = 0, i.e., in vector form:

− ξ 1 e1 + x1 − q = 0.

(A.21)

Finally, we will have the generalized demand for assets:
h
i
(A.22)
q = Γ −1 E e 1 − e 0 ,
where q, et are vectors, and Γ is a matrix. We provide a derivation of this demand in section A.3.C. The
financiers buy a dollar value qi of country i’s bonds at time 0, and − ∑in=1 qi dollar bonds, so that the net
time-0 value of their initial position is 0. The correspondence with the basic Gamma model (with only 2
countries) is q = − Q, xit = ιit .
We summarize the set-up below.
Lemma A.3. In the extended n-country model, the basic equations describing the vectors of exchange rates et are:
(A.23)

ξ 0 e0 − x0 − q = 0,

(A.24)

ξ 1 e1 − x1 + q = 0,
h
i
E e1 − e0 = Γq.

(A.25)

Those are exactly the equations of the 2−country model (with QGamma = −qhere ), and ιGamma = xhere ,
but with n countries (so et ∈ Rn−1 ). Hence the solution is the same (using matrices). We assume that ξ 1 is
deterministic.
Proposition A.3. The exchange rates in the n−country model are given by the following vectors:
(A.26)
(A.27)

e1 = ξ 0 + ξ 1 + ξ 0 Γξ 1

Hence, the above model has networks of trade in goods, and multi-country asset demand.

A.3.C

Derivation of the multi-asset, multi-country demand

We derive the financiers’ demand function in a multi-asset case. We start with a general asset case, and then
specialize our results to exchange rates.

A.3.C.1

General asset pricing case

Basic case We use notations that are valid in general asset pricing, as this makes the exposition
clearer and more general. We suppose that there are assets a = 1, . . . , A, with initial price p0 , and period 1
payoffs p1 (all in R A ). Suppose that the financiers hold a quantity position θ ∈ R A of those assets, so that
the terminal value is θ · p1 . We want to compute the equilibrium price at time 0.
Let
h i
π = E p1 − p0 ,
A.11

denote the expected gain (a vector), and
 
V = var p1 ,
denote the variance-covariance matrix of period 1 payoffs.
Given a matrix G, our demand will generate the relation
π = Gθ ∗ ,

(A.28)

h
i
∗
This is a generalization to an arbitrary number of assets of the basic demand of Lemma 2, Q0 = Γ1 E e0 − e1 RR .
The traditional mean-variance case is G = γV. The present machinery yields more general terms: for example, we could have G = V H 0 , for a “twist” matrix H. The mean-variance case is H = γIn , for a risk-aversion
scalar γ. The H can, however, represent deviations from that benchmark, e.g. source-dependent risk aversion (if H = diag (γ1 , ..., γ A ), we have a “risk aversion" scalar γa for source a), or tractability-inducing twists
(our main application here). Hence, the machinery we develop here will allow to go beyond the traditional
mean-variance setup.

The financiers’ profits (in dollars) are: θ · p1 − p0 , and their expected value is θ 0 π, where π :=
 
E p1 − p0 . We posit that financiers solve:
max θ 0 π s.t. θ 0 π ≥ θ 0 Sθ,

θ∈R A

where S is a symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix. This is a limited commitment constraint: the financiers’ outside option is θ 0 Sθ. Hence, the incentive-compatibility condition is θ 0 π ≥ θ 0 Sθ. Again, this is a
generalization (to an arbitrary number of assets) of the constraint in the paper in Equation (8).
The problem implies:
π = Sθ ∗ ,
where θ ∗ is the equilibrium θ.64
Hence, we would deliver (A.28) if we could posit S = G. However, this is not exactly possible, because
S must be symmetric, and G is not necessarily symmetric.
We posit that the outside option θ 0 Sθ equals:65
θ 0 Sθ ≡

(A.29)

∑ θi2
i,j

1θi∗ 6=0
θi∗

Gij θ j∗ ,

where θ is chosen by the financier under consideration, and θ ∗ is the equilibrium demand of other financiers
(in equilibrium, θ = θ ∗ ). This functional form captures the fact that as the portfolio or balance sheet expands
(θi high), it is “more complex” and the outside option of the financiers increases. In addition (if say G = γV),
it captures that high variance assets tighten the constraint more (perhaps again because they are more
“complex” to monitor). The non-diagonal terms indicate that “similar” assets (as measured by covariance)
matter. Finally, the positions of other financiers matter. Mostly, this assumption is made for convenience.
However, it captures the idea (related to Basak and Pavlova (2013)) that the positions of other traders
influence the portfolio choice of a given trader. The influence here is mild: when G is diagonal, there is no
influence at all.
We will make the assumption that

∀i, sign (πi∗ ) = sign (θi∗ ) , where π ∗ ≡ Gθ ∗ .

(A.30)

This implies that S is a positive semi-definite matrix: for instance, when θi∗ 6= 0, ∑ j θ1∗ Gij θ j∗ ≥ 0. Equation
i
(A.30) means that the sign of the position θi∗ is equal to the sign of the expected return πi . This is a mild
64 The proof is as follows. Set up the Lagrangian L = θ 0 π + λ ( θ 0 π − θ 0 Sθ ). The first-order condition reads 0 = L 0 =

Hence, π = Sθ.

∑ j Gij θ j∗ = ( Gθ ∗ )i . When θi∗ = 0, assumption (A.30) implies again (Sθ ∗ )i = ∑ j Sij θ j∗ = 0 = πi∗ = ( Gθ ∗ )i .
Thus, Sθ ∗ = Gθ ∗ . Hence, the set-up induces π = Sθ ∗ = Gθ ∗ . 

Proposition A.5. Suppose that we can write G = V H 0 , for some matrix H. Then, a riskless portfolio simply offers
the riskless US return, and in that sense the model is arbitrage-free.
Proof: Suppose that you have a riskless, 0-investment portfolio κ: κ 0 V = 0. Given π = V H 0 θ ∗ , we have
= κ 0 Gθ ∗ = κ 0 V H 0 θ ∗ = 0, i.e. the portfolio has 0 expected return, hence, as it is riskless, the portfolio
has 0 return. 
Proposition A.7 offers a stronger statement that the model is arbitrage-free.

A.3.C.2

Extension with derivatives and other redundant assets

The reader may wish to initially skip the following extension. When there are redundant assets (like derivatives), some care needs to be taken when handling indeterminacies (as many portfolios are functionally
equivalent). Call Θ the full portfolio, including redundant assets, and Pt the full price vector. We say that
assets a ≤ B are a basis, and we reduce the portfolio Θ into its “basis-equivalent” portfolio in the basis,
θ ∈ RB , with price pt , defined by:
Θ · P1 = θ · p1 ,

for all states of the world.

For instance, if asset c is redundant and equal to asset a minus asset b (p1c = p1a − p1b ), then (θ a , θb ) =
( Θ a + Θ c , Θ b − Θ c ).
More generally, partition the full portfolio into basis assets Θ B and derivative assets Θ D , Θ = (Θ B , Θ D ),
and similarly partition prices in P = ( p, p D ). We sometimes write p B rather than p when this clarifies
matters. As those assets are redundant, there is a matrix Z such that
p1D = Zp1 .
Then, the basis-equivalent portfolio is θ = Θ B + Z 0 Θ D .66
Then, we proceed as above, with the “basis-equivalent portfolio”. This gives the equilibrium pricing
of the basis assets, p0B . Then, derivatives are priced by arbitrage:
p0D = Zp0 ,

Formulation with a Stochastic Discount Factor

The following section is more advanced, and may be skipped by the reader.
It is often useful to represent pricing via a Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF). Let us see how to do that
here. Call w = P10 Θ = p10 θ the time-1 wealth of the financiers. Recall that we have π = Gθ ∗ , with G = V H 0 .
If we had traditional mean-variance preferences, with π = γVθ ∗ , we could use a SDF: M = 1 − γ {w},
for a scalar γ. We want to generalize that idea.
66 Proof:

the payoffs are Θ0 P1 = Θ0B p1 + Θ0D p1D = Θ0B p1 + Θ0D Zp1B = θ 0 p1B with θ 0 = Θ0B + Θ0D Z.

A.13

As before, we define

{ X } ≡ X − E[ X ]

to be the innovation to a random variable X.


Recall that we are given B basis assets a = 1, . . . , B (i.e., p1a a=1,...,B are linearly independent), while
assets a = B + 1, ..., A are derivatives (e.g. forward contracts), and so their payoffs are spanned by the
vector p1a a≤ B .
Next, we choose a linear operator Ψ for the basis assets that maps random variables into random
variables.67 It is characterized by:
n o
n o
Ψ p1a = ∑ Hab p1b for a = 1, . . . , B, and for b = 1, . . . , B,
b

or, more compactly:
n o
n o
Ψ p1 = H p1 .

This is possible because p1a are linearly independent. The operator extends to the whole space S of traded
assets (including redundant assets).
Proposition A.6. The pricing is given by the SDF:
M = 1 − Ψ {w} ,

(A.32)

where w = P10 Θ = p10 θ is the time-1 wealth of the financiers.

Proposition A.7. If the shocks p1 are bounded and the norm of matrix H, k H k, is small enough, then M > 0 and
the model is arbitrage-free.
In addition, it shows that the SDF depends linearly on the agents’ total terminal wealth w, including
their proceeds from positions in derivatives.

Proof. We need to check that this SDF generates: p0 = E Mp1 . Letting M = 1 − m with m = Ψ {w},

Application to the FX case in a multi-country set-up

We now specialize the previous machinery to the FX case. In equilibrium, we will indeed have (with
q = (qi )i=1,...,n ):
(A.33)

h
i
q = Γ −1 E e 1 − e 0 ,

67 Mathematically, call S the space of random payoffs spanned by (linear combinations of) the traded assets,

p1a a=1,...,B . S is a subset of L2 (Ω), where Ω is the underlying probability space. Ψ: S → S is an operator from S
to S, while H is a B × B matrix.

A.14

and q0 = − ∑in=1 qi ensures ∑in=0 qi = 0. We endogenize this demand, with
Γ = γV α ,

(A.34)


where V = var e1 , and var ( x ) = E [ xx 0 ] − E [ x ] E [ x 0 ] is the variance-covariance matrix of a random


vector x. Note that var e1 = var x1 is independent of e0 . Hence, with this endogenous demand, we
have a model that depends on variance, is arbitrage free, and (we believe) sensible.
Let us see how the general asset pricing case applies to the FX case. The basis assets are the currencies,
with pt = et , θ a is the position in currency a, and q a = θ a e0a is the initial dollar value of the position. The
position held in dollars is q0 (and we still have e0t = 1 as a normalization). We define
 
(A.35)
D = diag e0 ,
so that q = Dθ. We take the G matrix to be
G = γV α D,

for scalars γ > 0 and α ≥ 0. Recall that V = var e1 is a matrix. The reader is encouraged to consider
the leading case where α = 1. In general, V α is the variance-covariance matrix to the power α: if we write

0
0
V = U ΛU for U an orthogonal matrix and Λ = diag (λi ) a diagonal matrix, V α = U diag λiα U.

(A.36)

Proposition A.8. (FX case: Foundation for the financiers’ demand (A.22)) With the above set-up, the financiers’
equilibrium holding q satisfies:
h
i
(A.37)
E e1 − e0 = Γq,
with

Γ = γV α ,

where γ > 0 and α ≥ 0 are real numbers, and V = var e1 is the variance-covariance matrix of exchange rates. In


other terms, when Γ is invertible, we obtain the Gamma demand (A.22), q = Γ−1 E e1 − e0 .
Proof. This is a simple correlate of Proposition A.4. This Proposition yields
h
i
E p1 − p0 = Gθ ∗ ,
Using pt = et , Γ ≡ γV α , G ≡ ΓD, q = Dθ ∗ , we obtain
h
i
E e1 − e0 = Gθ ∗ = ΓDθ ∗ = Γq.


It may be useful to check the logic by inspecting what this yields in the Basic Gamma model. There,
the outside option of the financiers is given by (A.29) (using θ = −q/e0 , since in the basic Gamma model
the dollar value of the yen position is −q)
θ 0 Sθ = γθ 2 var (e1 )α e0 = γvar (e1 )α

The financiers’ maximization problem is thus:

i.e., the divertable fraction is γvar (e1 )α e0 . It is increasing in q and the variance of the trade (a “complexity”

or,

which confirms the intuitive properties of this derivation.

A.3.C.5

Application to the CIP and UIP trades

Suppose that the assets are: dollar bonds paying at time 1, yen bonds paying at time 1 (so that their payoff
is e1 ), and yen futures that pay e1 − F at time 1, where F is the futures’ price. The payoffs (expressed in
dollars) are:
P1 = (1, e1 , e1 − F )0 ,
and the equilibrium time-0 price is:

P0 = (1, e0 , 0)0 ,

as a futures position requires 0 initial investment.
Suppose that financiers undertake the CIP trade, i.e. they hold a position:
ΘCIP = (e0 , −1, 1)0 ,
where they are long the dollar, short the yen, and long the future. To review elementary notions in this
language, the initial price is ΘCIP · P0 = 0. The terminal payoff is ΘCIP · P1 = e0 − F, hence, by no arbitrage,
we should have F = e0 .
The financiers can also engage in the UIP trade; in the elementary UIP trade they are long 1 dollar, and
short the corresponding yen amount:

0
−1
U IP
Θ
= 1,
,0 .
e0
Assume that financiers’ portfolio is composed of C CIP trades, and q UIP trades:
Θ = CΘCIP + qΘU IP .
We expect the risk premia in this economy to come just from the risk currency part (q), not the CIP position
(C ). Let us verify this.
In terms of the reduced basis, we have
θ CIP = (e0 − F, 0)0 ,


−1 0
θ U IP = 1,
,
e0
so that

θ = Cθ CIP + qθ U IP .

Hence, the model confirms that the financiers have 0 exposure to the yen coming from the CIP trade. We
then have
E [e0 − e1 ] = Γq,
with Γ = γvar (e1 )α . The CIP trade, causing no risk, causes no risk premia. We summarize the results in the
following lemmas.

A.16

Lemma A.4. If the financiers undertake both CIP and UIP trades, only the net positions coming from the UIP trades
induce risk premia.

Lemma A.5. Assume that α ≥ 1, or that V = var x1 is invertible (and α ≥ 0). Then, in the FX model risk-less
portfolios earn zero excess returns. In particular, CIP holds in the model, while UIP does not.
Proof: Define W = γV α−1 D, which is well-defined under the lemma’s assumptions. Then, we can
write G = γV α D as G = VW, and apply Proposition A.5. 

N UMERICAL G ENERALIZATION OF THE M ODEL

We include here a generalization of the basic Gamma model of Section II that relaxes some of the assumptions imposed in the main body of the paper for tractability. The generalization of the model in Section
II has to be solved numerically. Our main aim is to verify, at least numerically, that all the core forces of
the basic model carry through to this more general environment. We provide a brief numerical simulation
and stress that this is only a numerical example without any pretense of being a full quantitative assessment. A full quantitative assessment, with its need for further channels and numerical complications, while
interesting, is the domain of future research.

Model Equations Since the model is a generalization of the basic one, we do not restate, in the interest of
space, the entire structure of the economy. We only note here that the model has infinite horizon, symmetric
initial conditions (both countries start with zero bond positions), and report below the system of equations
needed to compute the solution.

where η is the share of financiers’ profits repatriated to the US, and D are the US net foreign assets. This is
a system of five nonlinear stochastic equations in five endogenous unknowns { R, R∗ , e, Q, D }. We solve the
system numerically by second order approximation. The exogenous variables evolve according to:
(A.44)

ln ι t = (1 − φι ) ln ι t−1 + σι ε ι,t ;

ln ξ t = (1 − φξ ) ln ξ t−1 + σξ ε ξ,t ,

(A.45)

f t = (1 − φ f ) f t−1 + σ f ε f ,t ;

f t∗ = (1 − φ f ) f t∗−1 + σ f ε f ∗ ,t ,

(A.46)
(A.47)

β t = β̄ exp ( xt );
xt = (1 − φx ) xt−1 + σx ε x,t ;

β∗t = β̄ exp ( xt∗ ),
xt∗ = (1 − φx ) xt∗−1 + σx ε x∗ ,t ,

where [ε ι , ε ξ , ε f , ε f ∗ , ε x , ε x∗ ] ∼ N (0, I ). We assume that all other processes, including the endowments, are
constant.
The deterministic steady state is characterized by: {ē = 1, R̄ = R̄∗ = β̄−1 , Q̄ = D̄ = D̄ ∗ = 0}.68 In
order to provide a numerical example of the solution, we briefly report here the chosen parameter values.
We stress that this is not an estimation, but simply a numerical example of the solutions. We set β̄ = 0.985
that the deterministic steady state is stationary whenever Γ > 0, which we always assume here (i.e α = 0
from the main text). Similarly the portfolio of the intermediary is determinate via the assumption that households only
actively save in domestic currency and via the limited commitment problem of the intermediary.
68 Note

A.17

to imply a steady state annualized interest rate of 6%. We set the share of financiers’ payout to households
at η = 0.5, so that it is symmetric across countries. We set all constant output parameters at 1 (YH = YF =
∗ = χ = χ∗ = 18), so that they
a = a∗ = 1), except for the value of non-tradables set at 18 (YNT = YNT
account for 90% of the consumption basket. We set Γ = 0.1.69 Finally, we set the shock parameters to:
φι = φξ = 0.018, σι = σξ = 0.037, φ f = 0.0001, σ f = 0.05, φx = 0.0491, σx = 0.0073.
We report in Table A.1 below a short list of simulated moments.70 For a rough comparison, we also
provide data moments focusing on the GBP/USD exchange rate and US net exports.

Data and model-simulated moments. The first column reports the standard deviation (SD ( ete+t 1 − 1)) and (one minus) autocorrelation (φ(et+1 , et )) of exchange rates, the average carry trade return ( R̄c ) and its standard deviation (SD ( Rct )), the standard
deviation (SD (nxt )) and (one minus) the autocorrelation coefficient (φ(nxt , nxt−1 )) of net exports over GDP for the US, and
the standard deviation (SD ( Rt )) and (one minus) autocorrelation of interest rates (φ( Rt+1 , Rt )). Data sources: exchange rate
moments are for the GBP/USD, the carry trade moments are based on Lettau, Maggiori and Weber (2014) assuming the interest
rate differential is 5%, the interest rate moments are based on the yield on the 6-month treasury bill minus a 6-year moving average
of the 6-month rate of change of the CPI. All data are quarterly 1975Q1-2012Q2 (150 observations). The reported moments are
annualized. Model implied moments are computed by simulating 500,000 periods (and dropping the first 100,000). The carry trade
moments are computed selecting periods in the simulation when the interest rate differential is between 4% and 6%.

Finally, we provide a numerical example of classic UIP regressions. The regression specification follows:
∆ ln(et+1 ) = α + βU IP [ln( Rt ) − ln( R∗t )] + ε t .
The above regression is the empirical analog to the theoretical results in Section III.A.71 We find a regression
coefficient well below one ( β̂ = 0.33), the level implied by UIP. Indeed, on average we strongly reject UIP
with an average standard error of 0.19. The regression adjusted R2 is also low at 0.018. The results are
broadly in line with the classic empirical literature on UIP.
set this conservative value of Γ based on a thought experiment on the aggregate elasticity of the exchange
rate to capital flows. We suppose that an inelastic short-term flow to buy the Dollar, where the scale of the flow is
comparable to 1 year worth of US exports (i.e. f ∗ = 1), would induce the Dollar to appreciate 10%. The numbers
are simply illustrative, but are in broad congruence with the experience of Israel and Switzerland during the recent
financial crisis. Let us revert to the basic Gamma model. Suppose that period 1 is a “long run” during which inflows
have already mean-reverted (so that the model equations are: e0 − 1 + f ∗ + Q = 0, e1 = 1, Q = Γ1 (e0 − e1 )). Then, we
Γ
Γ
∗
have e0 = 1 − 1+
Γ f . Hence, the price impact is e0 − 1 = − 1+Γ ' −0.1. This leads to Γ ' 0.1.
70 The moments are computed by simulating 500,000 periods with pruning. We drop the first 100,000 observations
(burn-in period).
71 To estimate the regression based on model-produced data, we simulate the model for 500,000 periods, dropping
the first 100,000, and then sample at random 10,000 data intervals of length 150. The length is chosen to reflect the data
span usually available for the modern period of floating currencies (150 quarters). On each data interval, we estimate
the above regression. Finally, we average across the regression output from the 10,000 samples.

Recall that we assume that in period t = 1 financiers only intermediate the new flows; stocks arising from
previous flows are held passively by the households (long term investors) until t=2. Therefore, from the

Proof of Proposition 9 Lemma 6 shows that the Yen (strictly) monotonically depreciates as a function
of the intervention q∗ . Let e0 (q∗ ) be the exchange rate as a function of the intervention. From Section II.E
and the assumption in this proposition that output is demand determined under PCP, we know that:
YF,0 =

(A.55)

e0 ( q ∗ )
p∗F

∀q∗ ∈ [0, q∗ ),

so that Japanese tradable output increases monotonically as a function of the intervention. We define q∗ ≡
min{argmaxq∗ YF,0 (q∗ )} as the smallest intervention that achieves full employment. Strict monotonicity of
YF,0 (q∗ ) for all q∗ such that YF,0 < L and the fact that YF,0 is bounded above by L guarantee that q∗ exists
and is unique.
The consumption shares are obtained from the household demand functions plus market clearing, so

At time t = 0 we have ι0 = 1 and p F,0 = p∗F e0 , and substituting in the output expression

Proof of Proposition 12 We first prove a Lemma.

Lemma A.6. In the setup of Proposition 3, e0 is increasing in ι t and R∗ and decreasing in ξ t and R; ∂e
∂ι0 increases in

Γ. In addition, e0 increases in Γ if and only if the US is a natural net debtor at time 0 , i.e. N0+ ≡ ξ 0 e0 − ι0 < 0.

Proof: The comparative statics with respect to ι t , ξ 0 , and R are simply by inspection. We report here
