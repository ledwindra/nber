    "abstract": "\n\nWe formalize the GATT/WTO principle of reciprocity in workhorse quantitative trade models, characterizing reciprocal tariff cuts that hold terms of trade fixed and investigating their labor-market impacts. We provide closed-form expressions mapping reciprocal tariff cuts to labor market dislocation. We demonstrate that a country\u2019s own tariff liberalization is a sufficient statistic for the labor-market adjustments it can expect from tariff negotiations that satisfy reciprocity. Applying our theoretical results to China\u2019s 2001 WTO accession, we find that China\u2019s tariff reductions exceeded reciprocity norms, increasing real incomes but amplifying the manufacturing employment dislocation \u2013 the China Shock \u2013 in the United States and globally.\n\n",
