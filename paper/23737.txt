Slicing the Pie: Quantifying the Aggregate and Distributional Effects of Trade

NBER Working Paper No. 23737
August 2017
JEL No. F1
ABSTRACT
We develop a multi-sector gravity model with heterogeneous workers to quantify the aggregate
and group-level welfare effects of trade. We estimate the model using the structural relationship
between China-shock driven changes in manufacturing employment and average earnings across
US groups defined by commuting zone and education. We find that the China shock increases
average welfare but some groups experience losses as high as five times the average gain.
Adjusted for plausible measures of inequality aversion, gains in social welfare are positive and
only slightly lower than with the standard aggregation.

Introduction

The recent empirical literature has made economists less sanguine about the overall
benefits from increased trade integration. Although the notion that there are losers
from trade is one of the oldest propositions in the field, recent empirical work exemplified most prominently by Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) has shown that the distributive implications of trade shocks in developed countries are stronger and more persistent than previously believed.1 In their survey of this work, Autor, Dorn and Hanson
(2016) conclude that “it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate
the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory
alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how
much, and under what conditions.” In this paper we take a step in this direction – we
develop and estimate a multi-sector gravity model of trade with heterogeneous labor
and use it to quantify the group-level and aggregate welfare effects of the China shock
and overall trade in the United States.
Our model combines three components: a multi-sector version of the Eaton and
Kortum (2002) model as in Costinot, Donaldson and Komunjer (2012); a Roy model of
the allocation of heterogeneous labor to sectors with a Fréchet distribution as in Lagakos and Waugh (2013); and the existence of different labor groups differing in their
pattern of comparative advantage across sectors. The model yields a simple expression for the group-level welfare effects of trade that generalizes the formula previously
shown by Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2012) (henceforth ACR) to be valid
for a wide class of gravity models. Compared to the ACR formula, ours has an extra term
that captures the group-level effects of trade through changes in the vector of sectorspecific wages. Thus, following a logic similar to that in the the specific-factors model,
groups with high employment shares in sectors that experience strong increases in import competition will fare worse than other groups. The strength of these distributional
effects depends on the shape parameter of the Fréchet distribution, κ, which governs
the degree of labor heterogeneity across sectors: if κ → 1 then our model yields the
same welfare implications as the one with sector-specific labor and distributional effects are strongest, while if κ → ∞ then we are back to the single ACR formula applying

to all groups.
Inspired by Autor et al. (2013) (henceforth ADH), our quantitative analysis focuses
on the effect of the China shock on United States workers grouped according to commuting zone and education level. Not only is the focus on local labor markets important in its own right, but it also allows us to build on the empirical strategy developed by
ADH to arrive at a credible estimate of κ. We employ an instrumental variable approach
where the first stage estimates the group-level effect of the China shock on manufacturing employment, a regression corresponding to the reduced-form of one of the central
regressions in ADH. The second stage then exploits the model-implied relationship between the projected change in the share of employment in non-manufacturing (one
of the sectors in the model) and group-level average earnings. The estimation yields a
value for κ around 2, which is in line with estimates of this Roy-Fréchet parameter in
related contexts (e.g., Adao, Arkolakis and Esposito 2017, Burstein, Morales and Vogel
2015 and Hsieh, Hurst, Jones and Klenow 2013).
Armed with our estimate of κ, we calibrate the China shock following a strategy similar to that proposed by Caliendo, Dvorkin and Parro (2015). Subsequently, we use the
comparative-statics methodology in Dekle, Eaton and Kortum (2008) to compute the
group-level and aggregate welfare effects of the China shock in the United States. We
find that a small but non-negligible number of groups representing 6.7% of the population suffer welfare losses, and that those losses can be as high as five times the average
gains. The welfare effects are spatially correlated, implying the existence of regions
(e.g., southern Appalachia) where most groups tend to experience low or negative effects. To compute the aggregate welfare effects of the trade shock, we ignore the possibility that losers are compensated and use a social welfare function with inequality
aversion as in Atkinson (1970).2 We obtain the standard aggregation as a special case
with no inequality aversion. Initially poorer groups fare slightly worse after the shock,
implying a downward pull in the inequality-adjusted welfare gains. However, we argue
that for plausible measures of inequality aversion social welfare still increases with the
China shock and this increase is similar to the welfare gains without inequality aver-

2

Recent papers that pursue a similar strategy in the trade context are Antras, de Gortari and Itskhoki
(2016) and Carrère, Grujovic and Robert-Nicoud (2015). Antras et al. (2016) also considers the distortions
associated with compensation and quantifies the associated effect on the gains from trade.

Moving beyond the China shock, we also use our model to compute the group-level
and aggregate gains from trade, defined as in ACR as the negative of the losses from
moving to autarky. We again find that a small set of groups lose from trade, with one
group experiencing losses of 3.2%, twice the mean gain across all groups. With no inequality aversion the aggregate gains from trade are 1.5%. Nevertheless, trade increases
inequality, thus lowering the inequality-adjusted gains from trade to 1.37%.
Relative to the reduced-form approach in Autor et al. (2013), our general-equilibrium
structural analysis enables us to compute the welfare gains and losses caused by the
China shock across groups, rather than only the associated relative income effects. We
can also quantify the welfare effects of counterfactual shocks such as a move to autarky
or a decline in trade costs. Our framework thus serves to establish a formal connection between the fast-growing empirical literature on the distributional implications
of trade shocks and the more theoretical approaches to compute aggregate welfare effects of trade surveyed in Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014). At the same time, by
assuming competitive labor markets with a perfectly inelastic labor supply, all welfare
effects operate through changes in real factor prices. As a result, we are unable to capture the effects of trade on employment, and the large associated costs to individuals
inside groups. As discussed in detail towards the end of the paper, this is an important
and challenging question for future research.
Our paper is related to several research areas in international trade. A growing body
of empirical work documents substantial variation in local labor-market outcomes in
response to national-level trade shocks. In addition to Autor et al. (2013), see for example Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2016), Kovak (2013) and Topalova (2010).4 Additionally,
a large empirical and theoretical literature studies the distributional effects of trade –
some important recent contributions are Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song (2014), Burstein
and Vogel (2016), Costinot and Vogel (2010), Helpman, Itskhoki, Muendler and Redding
(2017) and Krishna, Poole and Senses (2012). A literature focusing specifically on the effect of trade shocks on the reallocation of workers across sectors finds significant effects
3
We discuss how to calibrate inequality aversion in Section 5. As a preview, one can assume as in Jones
and Klenow (2016) that this comes from risk aversion for agents behind the veil of ignorance – in that case
one can use estimates of risk aversion to calibrate inequality aversion.

Other empirical papers exploring the effects of trade shocks on local labor markets are Dauth, Findeisen and Suedekum (2014), Hakobyan and McLaren (2016) and Yi, Müller and Stegmaier (2016)

for developed countries (Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren 2010, Pierce and Schott 2016,
Revenga 1992), although less so in developing counries (see, e.g., Goldberg and Pavcnik
2007 and Dix-Carneiro 2014).
Artuç et al. (2010), Dix-Carneiro (2014) and Adão (2016) also use a Roy model of the
allocation of workers across sectors to offer a structural analysis of the distributional
effects of trade shocks, but they focus on exogenous changes in the terms of trade in a
small economy.5 We complement these papers by linking the Roy model of the labor
market with a gravity model of trade and by using the resulting framework to provide a
simple and transparent way to quantify the aggregate and distributional welfare effects
of trade. In this respect, our paper is most closely related to Caliendo et al. (2015),
Lee (2016), and Adao et al. (2017). All these papers develop models similar to ours but
pursue different estimation methods and focus on different questions: Caliendo et al.
(2015) emphasize the dynamics of adjustment after an unexpected trade shock, Lee
(2016) focuses on the implications for the skill premium, and Adao et al. (2017) center
on how the effect of the trade shock is affected by the interaction between workers’
employment decisions and agglomeration economies at the local level.6
Finally, our paper is also related to Hsieh and Ossa (2011), who use a gravity framework to conduct a comparative-statics analysis in the style of Dekle et al. (2008) to
quantify the aggregate effects of the China shock, and to Amiti, Dai, Feenstra and Romalis (2017) and Bai and Stumpner (2017), both of which estimate the effect of the
China shock on the U.S. consumer price index.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the baseline model
and presents our theoretical results. The data is described in Section 3, and Section
4 discusses the empirical findings and structural estimation of the model. Section 5
presents the results of the estimated model and the calibrated China shock for welfare
of US groups, while Section 6 computes the aggregate and group-level gains from trade.
Section 7 presents extensions of the baseline model and a discussion of employment
effects. Section 8 concludes.

Other structural analyses of trade liberalization and labor market adjustments are Coşar (2013), Coşar,
Guner and Tybout (2016) and Kambourov (2009). There is also a literature on the impact of trade on
poverty and the income distribution using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) methodology – see
for example Cockburn, Decaluwé and Robichaud (2008).
6
While all the papers cited so far focus on the differential impact of trade through the earnings channel,
another set of papers focuses on the expenditure channel – see Atkin and Donaldson (2015), Faber (2014),
Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) and Porto (2006).

Theory

We present a multi-sector, multi-country, Ricardian model of trade with heterogeneous
workers. There are N countries and S sectors. Each sector is modeled as in Eaton
and Kortum (2002) - henceforth EK; there is a continuum of goods, preferences across
goods within a sector s are CES with elasticity of substitution σs , and technologies have
constant returns to scale with productivities that are distributed Fréchet with shape
parameter θs > σs − 1 and level parameters Tis in country i and sector s. Preferences
across sectors are Cobb-Douglas with shares βis . There are iceberg trade costs τijs ≥ 1
to export goods in sector s from country i to country j, with τiis = 1.
On the labor side, we assume that there are Gi groups of workers in country i. A
worker from group g in country i (henceforth simply group ig) has a number of efficiency units zs in sector s drawn from a Fréchet distribution with shape parameter
κig > 1 and scale parameters Aigs . Thus, workers within each group are ex-ante identical but ex-post heterogeneous due to different ability draws across sectors, as in Roy
(1951), while workers across groups also differ in that they draw their abilities from different distributions. The number of workers in a group is fixed and denoted by Lig .
This implies that labor supply is inelastic – workers simply choose the sector to which
they supply their entire labor endowment. In Section 7 we discuss extensions that allow for endogenous labor supply arising from mobility of workers across groups or the
possibility of home production.
If κig → ∞ for all ig and Aigs = 1 for all igs, the model collapses to the multi-sector
EK model developed in Costinot et al. (2012), while if κig → 1 for all ig then the model
has the same welfare and counterfactual implications as the model in which labor is
sector specific.7 On the other hand, if τijs → ∞ for all j 6= i and Gi = 1 then economy
i is in autarky and collapses to the Roy model in Lagakos and Waugh (2013) (see also
Hsieh et al. (2013)).8
7

The only difference between the model with sector-specific labor and ours with κig → 1 is that in ours
the elasticity of labor supply to any particular sector with respect to the wage in that sector goes to one
and not zero. However, for κig → 1 the reallocation of workers across sectors has no effect on the relative
supply of efficiency units of labor across sectors – see Equation 4. Note that κig → 1 implies that ηig → ∞
– when we report results for this limit we are implicitly normalizing Eigs by ηig .
8
There are two sources of comparative advantage in this model: first, as in Costinot et al. (2012), differences in Tis drive sector-level (Ricardian) comparative advantage; second, differences in Aigs lead to
factor-endowment driven comparative advantage. Given the nature of our comparative statics exercise,

Equilibrium

To determine the equilibrium of the model, it is useful to separate the analysis into two
parts: the determination of labor demand in each sector in each country as a function
of wages, which comes from the EK part of the model; and the determination of labor
supply to each sector in each country as a function of wages, which comes from the Roy
part of the model.
Since workers are heterogeneous in their sector productivities, the supply of labor
to each sector is upward sloping, and hence wages can differ across sectors. However,
since technologies and goods prices are national , wages cannot differ across groups.
Let wages per efficiency unit in sector s of country i be denoted by wis . From EK we
know that the demand for efficiency units in sector s in country i is

Labor supply is determined by workers’ choices regarding which sector to work in.
Let z = (z1 , z2 , ..., zS ) and let Ωis ≡ {z s.t. wis zs ≥ wik zk for all k}. A worker with productivity vector z in country i will choose sector s iff z ∈ Ωis . Let Fig (z) be the joint
probability distribution of z for workers of group ig. From Lagakos and Waugh (2013)
and Hsieh et al. (2013) we know that the share of workers in group ig that choose to
work in sector s is:9
however, the source of comparative advantage will not matter for the results – only the actual sector-level
specialization as revealed by the trade data will be relevant.
9
This result and the ones below generalize easily to a setting with correlation in workers’ ability draws
across sectors. In this case, the dispersion parameter κig is replaced by κig /(1 − ρig ), where ρig measures

This is a special implication of the Fréchet distribution and it implies that the share
P
of income obtained by workers of group ig in sector s (i.e., wis Eigs / wik Eigk ) is also
P
given by πigs . Note also that total income of group ig is Yig ≡ s wis Eigs = ηig Lig Φig ,

while total income in country i is Yi ≡ g∈Gi Yig .
Allowing for trade imbalances Dj via transfers as in Dekle et al. (2008), we have

Since λijs , Yj and Eigs are functions of the whole matrix of wages w ≡ {wis }, the system ELDis = 0 for all i and s is a system of equations in w whose solution gives the

Comparative Statics

Consider some change in trade costs or technology parameters. We proceed as in Dekle

changes in trade shares using (9) and changes in employment shares using (10).

Group-Level Welfare Effects

Our measure of welfare of individuals in group ig is ex-ante real income, Wig ≡

Yig /Lig

We are interested in the change in Wig caused by a shock to trade costs or foreign technology levels, henceforth simply referred to as a “foreign shock.” Cobb-Douglas preferences imply that

while from (8) and (10) we have Ŷig = ŵis π̂igs

. Combining these two results with (11)

we arrive at the following proposition:
Proposition 1. Given some shock to trade costs or foreign technology levels, the ex-ante

with all variation across groups coming from the second term. If κig −→ ∞ for all g ∈ Gi
Q −β /θ
then the gains for all groups in country i are equal to s λ̂iis is s , which is the multisector formula for the welfare effect of a trade shock in ACR. It is easy to show that the
Q −β /θ
term λ̂iis is s corresponds to the change in real income given wages while the term
s
Q −βis /κig
corresponds to the change in real income for group ig coming exclusively
s π̂igs
from changes in wages ŵis for s = 1, ..., S.10
Q −β /κ
The term s π̂igs is ig is related to the change in the degree of specialization of
group ig. We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a way to define the degree
of specialization of a group. Formally, the KL divergence of π ig ≡ {πig1 , πig2 , ..., πigS }
from β i ≡ {βi1 , βi2 , ..., βiS } is given by
DKL (π ig k β i ) ≡

X

βis ln(βis /πigs ).

s

Note that if group ig was in full group-level autarky (i.e., not trading with any other
group or country) then πigs = βis . Thus, DKL (π ig k β i ) is a measure of the degree of
specialization as reflected in the divergence of the actual distribution π ig relative to β i .

GALLE - RODRı́GUEZ-CLARE - YI

This implies that, apart from the common term

Q

−βis /θs
, the welfare effect of a trade
s λ̂iis

shock on a particular group in country i is determined by the change in the degree
of specialization of that group as measured by the KL divergence, multiplied by the
degree of heterogeneity in worker productivity across sectors as captured by 1/κig . For
example, a group that with high employment in textiles would become less specialized
and gain less from trade (compared to other groups) if a foreign shock leads the country
to import disproportionally more textiles.
As a parenthesis, we comment briefly on how our model relates to the one in ADH.
They derive their regression equations from a log-linear approximation of the equilibrium conditions of a multi-sector gravity model of trade with homogeneous and perfectly mobile workers across sectors, but with each group modeled as a separate economy. In this case all the variation in the effects of a shock across groups arises because
of different terms of trade effects. In our baseline model technologies are national and
there are no trade costs among groups within countries, so terms of trade are the same
for all groups. Instead, worker heterogeneity implies that some groups of workers are
more closely attached to some sectors, and it is this that generates variation in the effect
of trade shocks across groups.

2.4

Aggregate Welfare Effects

The aggregate welfare effect can be obtained from Proposition 1 as Ŵi ≡ Ŷi /P̂i =

The aggregate welfare effect of a trade shock is no longer given by the multi-sector ACR
Q −β /θ
term (i.e., Ŵi 6= s λ̂iis is s ). This is because a trade shock will in general affect wages
wis , and this in turn will affect welfare through its impact on income and sector-level
prices.

2.5

Aggregate and Group-Level Gains from Trade

Following ACR, we define the gains from trade as the negative of the proportional change
in real income for a shock that takes the economy back to autarky: GTi ≡ 1 − ŴiA and

11

SLICING THE PIE

GTig ≡ 1 − ŴigA . A move to autarky for country i entails τ̂ijs = ∞ for all s and all i 6= j
and D̂i = 0. Conveniently, solving for changes in wages in country i (i.e., solving for
ŵis for s = 1, ..., S) from Equation (7) only requires knowing the values of employment
shares, income levels and expenditure shares for country i, namely βis for all s and πigs
and Yig for all g, s. This can be seen by letting τ̂ijs → ∞ in Equation (7), which yields

in inter-industry trade, then the aggregate gains from trade are strictly higher than those
that arise in the limit as κi −→ ∞.

autarky. This implies higher losses if the economy were to move to autarky, and hence
higher gains from trade. Proposition 2 establishes that this result generalizes to the case
Gi > 1.
Turning to the group-specific gains from trade, we again use the KL measure of specialization to understand whether a group gains more or less than the economy as a
whole. The results of the previous section imply that the gains from trade for group ig

divergence.
Consider a group ig that happens to have efficiency parameters (Aig1 , ..., AigS ) that
give it a strong comparative advantage in a sector s for which the country as a whole has
a comparative disadvantage, as reflected in positive net imports in that sector. Group ig
would be highly specialized in s when the country is in autarky (but groups trade among
themselves) but that specialization would diminish as the country starts trading with
the rest of the world. As a consequence, the KL degree of specialization falls with trade
for group ig, implying lower gains relative to other groups in the economy.

In the quantitative analysis in Sections 5 and 6 we will see that this equation provides

the China shock and the move back to autarky for the United States. The benefit of
this result is that r̂is is observable in the data. Thus, if we can identify the impact of
a foreign shock on output shares, then we can use this Bartik-style result to compute
approximate relative income changes across groups.
This result is particularly useful for the shock that takes country i back to autarky.
For that case we have r̂is = βis /ris and hence we obtain an approximate sufficient

We can think of βis /ris as an index of the degree of import competition in industry s and

of import competition that we can directly observe in the data elevated to the power
1/κi . Note also that, since a foreign shock does not affect the autarky equilibrium, we

Inequality-Adjusted Welfare Effects

We follow Atkinson (1970) and think about social welfare as a (geometric) average of
welfare across all individuals with a constant inequality aversion parameter ρ > 0
(with ρ 6= 1 to simplify the exposition below). Since the zs for workers in group ig is
distributed Frechet with scale parameter Aigs and shape parameter κig , then income
κ

maxs wis zs for workers in group ig is distributed Frechet with scale parameter Φigig and
shape parameter κig . Social welfare in country i is then:

Data

For our quantitative analysis, we define groups based on geographic location and education. We follow ADH in using commuting zones (CZs) as geographic units to define
local labor markets, and further separate each CZ into two groups based on whether
workers hold at least an Associate’s degree.13 This leaves us with a total of 1,444 groups

13
Our assumption of fixed groups applied to this setting implies no mobility across local labor markets
and education categories. We view this as a reasonable assumption in light of existing literature that finds
little evidence of trade exposure causing population shifts across local labor markets. See, for example,
ADH for the US, Dauth et al. (2014) for Germany, and Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2016) for Brazil. Moreover,
except for the very long run, it seems reasonable to ignore the effect of trade on workers acquiring an
Associate’s degree.

(722 CZs x 2 skill groups). All countries other than the US are assumed to have a single
group.
Our sectors, listed in Appendix Table A.1, are based on the 1987 SIC classification
codes. We aggregate all manufacturing industries into 13 sectors which roughly correspond to two-digit ISIC Rev. 3 codes. The remaining sectors, excluding public administration and the non-profit sector, are aggregated to one non-manufacturing sector.
We restrict our analysis to the period 2000-2011. We obtain national figures on bilateral trade flows, sectoral output and employment shares from the World Input-Output
Database (WIOD), discussed in Timmer, Dietzenbacher, Los, Stehrer and Vries (2015).
For wages and labor shares across our US groups, we rely on data from the 2000 Census
and American Community Survey (ACS).14 In the regression analysis, we define labor
shares πigs based on the share of workers, share of labor hours or share of earnings
in sector s.15 For the simulation analysis, we require consistency between the trade
and labor data and therefore focus on πigs as shares of earnings, πigs =

Empirics

In this section we first apply the ADH “China shock” to our setting, and examine the
reduced-form impact of the China shock on income and on the share of workers employed in non-manufacturing, both at the group level. We then impose κig = κ and
estimate κ by exploiting the theoretical link between trade-induced expansion of the
non-manufacturing sector and changes in group-level income.17
14

The Census and ACS Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are mapped into commuting zones using
a crosswalk provided by David Dorn.
15
Recall that in our Roy-Frechet framework the share of workers of any group ig in sector s is the same
as the share of earnings derived from working in that sector
16
The different measures for πigs and yg employed in the regression and simulation analysis are highly
correlated (see Figures B.1 and B.2 in the Appendix).
17
Throughout the regression analysis, we restrict our sample to full-time workers. We performed a robustness analysis for the full sample of workers and find that the results are highly similar.

The rise of China as a trade shock

Throughout our empirical analysis, we follow ADH and focus on the “China shock” to
US manufacturing. Specifically, we use changes in sector-level exports from China to a
group of countries similar to the US to proxy for changes in sectoral import-competition
from China in the US.18 The assumption behind this identification strategy is that increased Chinese exports to these other advanced economies are driven by the exogenous “rise of China,” which consists of Chinese productivity growth in manufacturing
and reductions in export costs for Chinese producers.19
Our specific measure of the China import-penetration shock in sector s is

over the period 2000 to 2011.20 Since we use this same period in all the regressions
below, we henceforth suppress the t subindex.

4.2

Reduced-form impact of the China shock

We first explore the impact of the China shock in our setting by examining its reducedform effect on group-level income via the following Bartik-style regression:

ln ŷg = α + β

18

This set of countries consists of Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan and Spain. Except for
Switzerland and New Zealand, which are not included in the WIOD data, this set of “Other” countries is
identical to the set in ADH. Countries are selected based on having a similar income level as the US, but
direct neighbors are excluded.
19
For an extensive discussion on the exogeneity restrictions and the robustness of this identification
strategy, see ADH.
20
Our version of the import-penetration shock differs from the one in ADH due to different sector definitions and a different time period. We chose to have more aggregated sectors in order to link the labor
data with WIOD figures in a consistent manner. This is important for the simulation exercises. Compared
to the ADH time period (1990-2007), our choice of time horizon (2000-2011) resulted from the constraints
imposed by our different trade and labor datasets.

SLICING THE PIE

manufacturing employment. The set of manufacturing sectors is denoted by M . We
have suppressed the i subindex as all regressions in this section are for i = U S.
We also check the impact of the China shock on the change in the share of employment in the non-manufacturing sector, denoted by πgN M . Trade-induced changes in
πgN M are closely related to the ADH analysis, and will be central to our structural estimation of κU S . In the reduced-form regression analysis, we update equation (19) to
have ln π̂gN M as the dependent variable. Throughout the entire regression analysis, we
will report Conley (1999) standard errors, to account for spatial correlation in the error
term.21
In the data, we find that higher exposure to the China shock negatively affects groups’
income, and leads to an expansion of the non-manufacturing sector (Table 1).22 The
estimate of -0.0025 in column 1 indicates that each increase in exposure of $1,000 per
worker leads to a 0.25 percentage point smaller earnings increase. Since the difference
in the change in exposure between groups at the 10th and 90th percentiles was $10,000
per worker, this means that a group at the 90th percentile experienced a 2.5 percentage point larger earnings loss (or smaller earnings growth) than a group at the 10th
percentile. For non-manufacturing employment, the estimate of 0.005 implies that a
group at the 90th percentile of the exposure distribution experienced a 5 percentage
point larger increase in the non-manufacturing share of employment than a group at
the 10th percentile. In the next subsection, we will integrate these reduced-form findings into our structural estimation of κ.
Despite slight differences in the time period, the definition of sectors, and the countries used for the construction of the instrumental variable, our results are consistent
with those in ADH. In particular, we find that groups facing a higher exposure to the
China shock experience a relative decline in average earnings and in the share of employment in manufacturing. One difference is that in ADH the decline in the share
of employment in manufacturing comes mostly from a decline in overall manufacturing employment that is not compensated by an expansion of the non-manufacturing
21

For the OLS regressions we use code from Hsiang (2010), and for the IV the original code from Conley
(1999). For our baseline analysis we impose a distance cutoff for spatial correlation at 400km. As a robustness check, we increased the cutoff to 1000km and standard errors typically increase by less than 25
percent.
22
In addition, we estimate equation (19) with the group-level average labor income among workers employed in the manufacturing sector as dependent variable. We also find a negative effect, but it is not
statistically significant.

ignoring the effects on total employment – we return to this issue in Section 7.3.

4.3

Estimation of κ

As is evident from equation (12), the κ parameter is central to our model as it jointly affects the aggregate and the distributional welfare effects from trade. In this subsection
we estimate κ by exploiting the relationship between trade-induced expansion of the
non-manufacturing sector and income changes across groups.
Imposing κig = κ and using ŷg = Φ̂g together with equations (8) and (10) implies

shock offers a strong instrument. After taking logs, we obtain:

This gives rise to the following regression equation:

Table 2 presents the results for the IV regression described above. The first row
shows our second-stage results, while the third row has the corresponding estimate κ̂ =
−1/β̂, and the fifth row displays the F-statistic from the first stage. As implied by our
reduced-form results for the impact of the China shock on the expansion of the nonmanufacturing sector, the first-stage F-statistics are sufficiently high. The second stage
estimate is always significantly different from zero, and the values for κ̂ range from 1.95
to 2.15.23 This range of values is consistent with estimates of sector/occupation employment elasticities obtained by Adao et al. (2017), for sectors, and Hsieh et al. (2013)
and Burstein et al. (2015), for occupations. Despite different modeling and estimation
approaches, these papers find parameters of sector/occupation productivity dispersion (analogous to our κ) between 1.1 and 2.2.
For the next section, where we will run simulations to analyze the quantitative role
of κ in our framework, we will set our preferred value at κ = 2. In addition, we will also
show results for κ → 1 (the theoretical lower bound for κ), and for κ = 4. The latter
value is an upper bound of the 95% confidence intervals for the κ estimates.

23

As a robustness check, we also estimate κ on a sample including part-time workers and find slightly
lower point estimates, with values centered around κ = 1.6 (see Appendix Table A.2). These values are
within the 95% confidence intervals of the estimations in the current table, but would imply stronger distributional effects from the China shock. We also examined heterogeneity in kappa values for low versus
high-educated groups, and found that the kappa for high-educated workers is lower, but not significantly
different from the kappa for low-educated workers.

Aggregate and distributional effects of the rise of China

While existing research (e.g. ADH) has found strong distributional implications of the
“rise of China” across local labor markets in the US, this empirical research remains
largely silent on the associated group-level and aggregate welfare effects. We now perform counterfactual simulations with our model to shed light on this question.24

5.1

Calibrating the China shock

We model the rise of China as sector-specific technology shocks, T̂China,s . We calibrate
these shocks such that for each sector, the simulated changes in US expenditure shares
on Chinese goods match the change in these expenditure shares that is driven by the
24

In all the ensuing counterfactual exercises, we follow Head and Mayer (2014) and set θs = 5 for all s. We
perform our counterfactual exercises on data without trade deficits, which we obtain by first simulating
the trade equilibrium with balanced trade. This preliminary simulation is always performed with our
preferred value of κ = 2.

rise of China.25 The first step is to obtain predicted changes in US expenditure shares
from running a specification similar to ADH’s first-stage regression,

λ̂China,U S,s = α + β λ̂China,Other,s + εs ,
where λ̂China,Other,s ≡

PJ

. In a second step we calibrate T̂China,s so that the

model-implied changes in the US expenditure share on imports from China, λ̂China,U S,s ,
match the predicted values from the first step.

5.2

Aggregate and distributional welfare effects

The results for the US welfare effects of the China shock as calibrated above are shown
in Table 3 for four different values of κ: 1, 2, 4 and ∞, and for θs = 5 for all s.26 The
first column shows the aggregate welfare effect for the case with no inequality aversion,
ŴU S , while the next four columns show the mean, the coefficient of variation (CV),
and the minimum and maximum for the group-level welfare changes, ŴU S,g . The last
column shows the welfare effect according to the multi-sector ACR formula.
Focusing first on the results for our preferred value of κ = 2, the model implies US
aggregate welfare gains from the rise of China of 0.25%, with an average gain across
groups of 0.32%.27 The CV is 56%, and the range is [−1.64%, 1.34%]. While one group
loses 1.64% of its real income, almost 97% of groups experience positive gains from the
rise of China (see Appendix Figure A.1, panel b). There are 5 groups who lose more than
0.5% of their real income, whereas 110 groups have real income gains above 0.5%. Low
and high-educated groups experience almost identical average gains, but the CV for
high-educated groups is much larger at 67%, versus 40% for low-educated groups.28
25

This calibration is inspired by the procedure in Caliendo et al. (2015), who calibrate T̂China,s to match
predicted changes in US imports from China. Instead of imports, we focus on the expenditure shares
λChina,U S,s , and thereby avoid any complications arising from matching sectoral deflators for US imports
across simulations and data.
26
For reasons of comparability, the results for different values of κ correspond to the shock T̂China,s
as calibrated for κ = 2. Separately calibrating T̂China,s for each value of κ leads to similar results – see
Appendix Table A.3.
27
To provide context for this number, Hsieh and Ossa (2016) find welfare gains for the US between 0 and
0.03%. The difference with our results is likely due to the fact that we calibrate Chinese technology growth
to fit predicted Chinese exports, whereas Hsieh and Ossa (2016) calculate technological growth based on
firm-level data.
28
This finding differs from the results in Lee (2016), who finds that the wage skill-premium increases
in the United States as a consequence of the China shock. As discussed in Section 2.6, differences in the

In Figure 1, we plot the geographical distribution of the welfare effects from the
China shock, with the low-educated workers and high-educated groups in panels (a)
and (b) respectively. The correlation of the group-level welfare effects between lowand high-educated groups (across commuting zones) is 78%, and this high correlation is reflected in the strong similarity in the geographic distribution of the welfare
effects in the two panels of Figure 1. Still, for low-educated workers, the region around
South-Central and Southern Appalachia represents a particularly stark concentration
of groups with gains in the bottom sixth of the gains distribution. Regions where both
low- and high-educated groups tend to experience low gains (or losses) are Northern
Appalachia, the Midwest, the Northeast, and the southern parts of California and Arizona.29
The distributional impact of the China shock depends on κ, as a lower κ leads to
higher dispersion in the gains from trade due to a stronger pattern of worker-level comparative advantage. The simulation results confirm this theoretical prediction, as both

The finding that ln ŷg ≈ ln ŷ + κ1 ln s πgs r̂s is important for two reasons. First, it
P
confirms that κ1 ln s πgs r̂s (or − κ1 ln Iˆg ) can serve as an approximate sufficient statistic
for a group’s welfare change relative to that for the economy as a whole. This is useful
because, in contrast to the exact result in Proposition 1, it does not require knowing
the group-level employment changes π̂gs .34 Second, the formula suggests an empirical
validation test of our model and structural estimation of κ in Table 2. Specifically, since
we know that β ≈

we can estimate Equation 21 on observed data and compare the

implied values for κ with those from the structural estimation in Section 4.3.

striction in this IV regression is that sector-level growth in China affects group-level incomes only through its effect on US sectoral output and a group’s initial pattern of specialization. As shown in Table 4, the first stage has the expected sign and has sufficient
statistical power. The estimated coefficient β̂ is positive and strongly statistically significant in all specifications, which corroborates the theoretical prediction that regional
P
income changes depend positively on trade-induced changes in s πgs r̂s . The magnitudes of the β̂ estimates are also consistent with the theoretical analysis from Section
2.6 and with our simulation results, both of which implied β̂ < 1. More importantly,
the results validate our structural estimation approach for κ, since the β̂ estimates are
consistent with the results of Table 2. For our estimate κ = 2, the model-implied β̂ is
equal to 0.5, which is below the point estimates in Table 4, but within their respective
95% confidence intervals (see Figure 2).

Inequality-adjusted welfare effect

We summarize the aggregate and distributional welfare effects of the rise of China for
the US by computing the inequality-adjusted welfare effect from Equation (17). As
shown in Figure 3, for finite values of κ, ÛU S is weakly decreasing in the coefficient of
inequality aversion ρ.35 For our estimated value of κ = 2, ÛU S remains initially almost

P
As in Kovak (2013), the relationship we find between ln ŷg and ln s πgs r̂s also provides a theoretical foundation for the empirical use of Bartik-style regressors which assign national sectoral changes to
groups based on their initial sectoral composition. Relative to Kovak (2013), our model allows for heterogeneous labor and imperfect mobility across sectors.
35
The theory does not predict how ÛU S changes as function of ρ. Based on the result in equation 18, one
could think that the Generalized Mean Inequality (GMI) has implications for how ÛU S changes with the

equal to the standard welfare effect, then starts decreasing around ρ = 4, and finally
becomes negative for ρ > 13. Which are reasonable values for ρ?
To answer this question, we looked into several different interpretations for the social welfare function (SWF) in (17). The first interpretation is that the SWF in (17) comes
from a political process that aggregates the views and interests across agents in the
economy. According to this view, ρ could be calibrated based on actual policies, for example the progressivity of the tax system. As discussed Antras et al. (2016), this implies
ρ < 1 in the US.36 The second interpretation is that the SWF in Equation (17) reflects
a utilitarian approach to social welfare, with the utility of an individual with (real) income x being u(x) = x1−ρ . In this case ρ can be calibrated based on the curvature of
power 1 − ρ, but the GMI does not apply to ÛU S because the weights ωg are themselves dependent on the
power 1 − ρ.
36
Carrère et al. (2015) use the same approach and cite studies for the US and the United Kingdom to set
ρ = 1.

utility with respect to income, as for example in Layard, Mayraz and Nickell (2008), who
find that ρ ∈ [1, 2]. One can also use agents’ intertemporal elasticity of substitution to
estimate the curvature parameter – in the macro literature the common view is that
ρ ≈ 1 (see e.g. Lucas 2003), although a review of the literature leads Hall (2009) to the
conclusion that ρ = 2. The third approach is to think of Equation (17) as representing the ex-ante utility of a risk-averse agent “behind the veil of ignorance” regarding its
productivity vector (Z1 , ..., ZS ) – see for instance Jones and Klenow (2016). In this case
ρ would need to be calibrated based on people’s aversion to risk. Using an indirect approach based on the labor supply elasticity, Chetty (2006) finds that ρ < 2, while more
direct estimates based on people’s decisions under uncertainty range from ρ = 1 in
Bombardini and Trebbi (2012) and ρ ≈ 3 in Paravisini, Rappoport and Ravina (2016).37
Our conclusion from this literature review is that plausible values for ρ tend to be
lower than 4.38 For these values and for κ = 2, the inequality-adjusted welfare effect
37

There is also a literature estimating risk aversion to rationalize the equity premium. This leads to high
estimated values for ρ ∈ [10, 100], but see Lucas (2003) and Hall (2009) for skeptical takes on that approach.
38
In contrast to this positive perspective, one can also argue that inequality aversion is a normative concept and that the choice of ρ cannot be settled by empirical evidence (see e.g. Rawls 2001). Our discussion

28

GALLE - RODRı́GUEZ-CLARE - YI

of the China shock for the US is almost identical to the standard welfare effect with no
inequality aversion (ρ = 0). Even for κ → 1, the inequality-adjusted welfare effect remains positive for all plausible degrees of inequality aversion.39 We therefore conclude
that the positive impact of the China shock on inequality-adjusted welfare in the US
is a robust finding, while the precise comparison of the standard and the inequalityadjusted welfare effect is sensitive to the values of ρ and κ.
Coming back to the finding that the inequality-adjusted welfare effect of the China
shock is weakly decreasing in ρ, we can infer from Figure 4 that this is due to the existence of a set of initially poor groups that experience a higher than average increase
in import competition, Iˆg > 1. In turn, this comes from the fact that the China shock
P
China→Other is stronger for groups with lower initial income – see Figure
s∈M πgs ∆IPst
A.4 in the Appendix. However, an important caveat applies to this finding, as it is sensitive to our measurement of group-level income. Remember that we needed to adjust
the sectoral earnings as observed in the American Community Survey to make it compatible with WIOD (see Section 3). When we don’t perform this adjustment, then the
China shock appears neutral or slightly pro-poor (see Figure A.5 in the Appendix). This
implies that the finding that the China shock is pro-rich is fragile, as it depends on how
non-labor income is apportioned across groups.

here is therefore conditional on accepting the positive approach for calibrating inequality aversion in the
literature, and we acknowledge that different conclusions result from higher values of ρ.
39
Of course, even with ρ > 13, if society has access to lump-sum transfers then it feasible to ensure that
the inequality-adjusted welfare effect of the China shock is positive.

Gains from Trade

In this section we compute the aggregate and group-level gains from trade as described
in Section 2, i.e., by computing the negative of the proportional gains from a counterfactual move back to autarky. Table 5 summarizes the results. For our estimated value
of κ = 2, the aggregate gains from trade with no inequality aversion are 1.52%. As suggested by the theory, the gains from trade decrease with κ, but the effect is small, going
from 1.60% for κ = 1 to 1.45% for κ → ∞.
As in the analysis of the China shock, the main effect of κ is on the distribution of
the gains from trade across groups, with the CV decreasing from 59% for κ → 1 to 0%
for κ → ∞. For our preferred value of κ = 2, the CV is 33%, and the range is [-3.19, 2.41].
In total, only 26 groups lose from trade, but the distribution of gains is skewed to the
left, with a thick tail of low gains (see Appendix Figure A.3).

ticularly specialized in this industry will gain the least. Interestingly, there is a large region with heavy concentration of groups facing particularly strong import-competition
- largely due to due to specialization in the textile industry - centered around the SouthCentral and Southern Appalachia regions (see Appendix Figure A.7).
Figure 5 shows that for ρ > 0, the inequality-adjusted gains from trade are lower
than the standard gains, IGT < GT , and that IGT decreases with the ρ. This is a reflection of the fact that, as illustrated in Figure 6, the index of import competition is higher
for poorer groups. And contrary to the case with the China shock, this is true even if
we compute the index of import competition and average earnings using the American
Community Survey rather than the adjusted data used for the model simulations (see
Appendix Figure A.8). Note however that the IGT remain positive, except for values of
ρ (i.e. ρ > 11 for κ = 2) that seem implausibly high in light of the discussion in the
previous section. For ρ = 2, the IGT are 1.37%.

Extensions and Discussion

In this section we discuss extensions to allow for an input-output structure and trade
costs affecting trade between groups inside a country, and we discuss the link between
our model and the empirical literature on the employment effects of the China shock.

7.1

Intermediate Goods

Extending the model to allow for an input-output structure is potentially important
because a significant share of the value of production in a sector originates from other
sectors, and taking this into account may affect the effects of trade on wages ŵis and
hence the welfare effects across groups.
The labor supply of the model is exactly as in the baseline model (see Equations 3
and 4). On the trade side, the model is identical to Caliendo and Parro (2015), except
that wages are now sector-specific (i.e. wages are wis instead of wi ). Hence, trade shares
and the price indices are as in equations (1) and (2), but instead of wis we now have cis ,

Here, the αiks are the Cobb-Douglas input shares: a share αiks of the output of industry
s in country i is used buying inputs from industry k, and 1 − αis is the share spent on
P
labor, with αis = k αiks . Given this structure, we derive in Appendix D the following
expression for a group’s welfare change:

For this extended model, for κ = 2 we find a gain from the China shock of 0.34% and

33

SLICING THE PIE

gains from trade of 2.98% (see Table 6).40 These gains are higher than in the baseline
model, which is in line with the findings in Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014), who
explain that the input-output loop in this model leads to an additional round of welfare
gains from a given trade shock.
The distributional effects of both the China shock and opening to trade are somewhat mitigated compared to the baseline model. The CV is lower in both cases, and the
range of group-level welfare effects is slightly more compressed. Still, the correlation
between the group-level welfare effects in the two versions of the model is 92% and
97%, for the China shock and the gains from trade respectively (see Appendix Figure
A.9). Hence, the ranking of groups in terms of relative welfare effects is a robust finding
of the baseline model.

7.2

Within-US trade costs

An admittedly strong assumption of the analysis so far has been that there are no trade
costs within a country, which implied that Pis and wis are equalized across groups
within a country. In this section we relax this assumption for the US by allowing for
trade costs between US states (in addition to trade costs across countries), while retaining the assumption of frictionless trade within states.
Conceptually, we return to the baseline model from Section 2, the only difference
being that US states now play a role identical to the role of countries in the baseline
model. In particular, if group ig belongs to state n then
Ŵig =

Y

(25)

s

We use this framework to analyze how the quantitative results change when we allow
for within-US trade costs. We construct the necessary trade data to allow for trade costs
between US states by using the Commodity Flow Survey (see Appendix B for details).41
The summary statistics for the updated model differ only modestly from those for
40

Since the labor supply side of the model is unaltered compared to the baseline model, the κ estimation from Section 4.3 remains valid. This explains why we continue to use the same values for κ in the
quantification of this model.
41
In principle, the model could allow for trade costs between geographical units at an even more disaggregated level, but we are not aware of reliable trade data at lower levels of disaggregation that cover the
entire United States.

the baseline model. The average welfare gains in the updated model are somewhat
smaller than in the baseline model, for both the rise of China and the gains from trade
(see Table 7).42 For instance, for κ = 2, we found a mean welfare change of 0.32% due
to the rise of China in the baseline model, while in the current model we find a mean
welfare change of 0.23%. On the distributional side, the results are broadly similar for
the China shock, 43 but the distribution of the gains from trade is more dispersed in the
42

The gains from trade are computed as the negative of the percentage change in welfare from a counterfactual move to autarky by the whole United States but allowing US states to trade among themselves.
43
For instance, the range of welfare effects for κ = 2 is [-1.6,1.47] in the current model, compared to

SLICING THE PIE

35

model with states as countries. For κ = 2, the CV is now 0.44 and the range of grouplevel gains from trade is [-4.24, 2.90], compared to a CV of 0.33 and a range of [-3.19,
2.41] in the baseline model.
While the similarity in the summary statistics across the two models is reassuring,
we are mostly interested in how the precise incidence of the counterfactual shocks
across groups changes when we model US states as separate countries. We find that
the group-level welfare changes correlate strongly across the two models, but not perfectly: the correlation is 65% for the China shock and 47% for the return to autarky
(see Appendix Figure A.10). Importantly, the correlation in the Roy term across the two
models is even stronger, at 77% for the China shock and 72% for the return to autarky.
The Roy term also accounts for most of the variance in the welfare effects, since for the
China shock 78% of the variance in ln Ŵig for US groups arises only from the variance
Q −β /κ
in ln π̂igs ns . For the return to autarky this number is 70%.
s

We examine the geographical distribution of the welfare effects for the China shock
in Appendix Figure A.11. In line with the previous finding, the geographical pattern
for Ŵig (panels a and c) appears different from the corresponding pattern for the baseline model, but the patterns for the Roy terms (panels b and d) appear similar. We find
analogous results for the return to autarky (see Appendix Figure A.12). The difference
in the geographic distribution of the group-level welfare effects between the two models is therefore mostly due to variation in the multi-sector ACR term across US states.
This variation in the ACR term mainly arises from differences in expenditure shares βns
across states.
Importantly, we primarily implemented this extension of the model to examine the
robustness of our results when allowing for variation in sectoral wages across US states.
Given that the group-level Roy terms are broadly similar across the baseline and the
current model, we conclude that the impact of the China shock on group-level labor
reallocation is indeed relatively robust to such variation.

[-1.64,1.34] in the baseline model. While the CV tends to be higher in the current model, this is mainly due
to the lower mean welfare effect. Note also that since the US is now split into multiple countries, the CV of
the welfare effects across all US groups no longer tends to 0 as κ → ∞.

Employment Effects

We have built a model with perfectly inelastic labor supply - as is standard in the literature on gains from trade - and with no mobility across groups (or regions). One
obvious implication is that our model cannot generate changes in employment in response to trade shocks. Since such employment changes are one of the key empirical
results in ADH, we now discuss whether allowing for mobility, commuting or a positive
labor supply elasticity could make our model consistent with those results.
At a theoretical level, the assumption that there is no mobility across regions can

37

SLICING THE PIE

trivially be relaxed with no change in our results. Since groups differ only in the parameters of the distribution from which individuals draw their productivities (the Aigs
parameters), the fact that sector-level wages wis are national implies that there is no
incentive for an individual with some given productivity vector to switch to another region. But an alternative interpretation is that Aigs is the labor productivity of group ig
in sector s, and that individuals in all groups draw their productivity vector from the
same distribution. According to this interpretation, individuals would have incentives
to move across regions. In a previous version of this paper we showed how one can
use data on mobility across regions to extend our counterfactual analysis to this alternative model. Unfortunately, the data requirements are severe, and we have left this
analysis for future work. We note, however, that ADH find insignificant effects of the
China shock on population shifts at the commuting zone level, and hence we expect
that adding mobility in a way that is consistent with their evidence should not have
sizable effects on our results.44
Employment could also adjust through changes in commuting patterns, as in Monte,
Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2015). Extending our model to allow for commuting and
exploring the impact of the China shock in that setting is an interesting task but beyond the scope of this paper. Here we simply note that, as shown in Section 5, the
regions that are most negatively affected by the China shock tend to be geographically
concentrated, and so commuting is unlikely to be a significant margin of adjustment.
A final possible adjustment in employment to the trade shock arises from changes
in the employment to population ratio, and this margin of adjustment is in fact central to the empirical analysis in ADH. It is challenging to explain this employment adjustment by allowing for a choice between labor and leisure. This is because standard
0

u (c)
values of the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to consumption (i.e., − d ln
d ln c )

are equal or higher than one, and this typically implies that the income effect is weakly
stronger than the substitution effect, leading to a perfectly inelastic or downward sloping labor supply curve.45 One could instead allow for home production with no income
44

Caliendo et al. (2015) and Adao et al. (2017) allow for mobility across both sectors and regions and
quantify the effect of the China shock at the level of US states rather than commuting zones. Their results
also point to weak effects of trade shocks on mobility across regions. See also the discussion in footnote
15.

effects on labor supply, but this runs counter to evidence pointing to the importance
of income effects – see Blundell and MaCurdy (1999). To us, this suggests the need to
entertain some kind of labor market friction that can generate involuntary unemployment in response to a negative trade shock.

Conclusion

We think of this paper as establishing a bridge between two separate literatures. On the
one hand, a recent wave of empirical work exemplified most prominently by Autor et
al. (2013) has shown that trade shocks have important distributional implications, but
without deriving welfare effects. On the other hand, research surveyed in Costinot and
Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014) shows how to quantify the welfare effects of trade for a wide
class of gravity models, but with so far little to say about distributional implications.46
In this paper we extend the multi-sector gravity model of trade to allow for heterogeneous labor as in Roy (1951) and Lagakos and Waugh (2013) and with multiple groups
of ex-ante identical workers as in Burstein et al. (2015), and use the resulting framework
to derive a simple approach to computing group-level and aggregate welfare effects of
trade shocks. We borrow the identification strategy proposed by Autor et al. (2013),
but we use it here to estimate the model’s key parameter governing the degree of labor
heterogeneity and the distributional implications of trade shocks.
We use the model to quantify the welfare effects of the China shocks on groups in
the United States defined by geography and education. We find that the average effect
is positive, that some groups experience losses as high as five times the average gain,
and that those groups tend to be concentrated in certain geographic regions. Although
poorer groups tend to fare worse and hence between-group inequality increases, under
ployment would expand in the regions negatively affected by the China shock. We ran the same regression
as in Section 4 but with the employment rate as dependent variable and got a coefficient of 0.00182 (with
s.e. 0.00105), which would imply a labor supply elasticity of 0.75. To get  = 0.75, and appealing to Chetty,
Guren, Manoli and Weber (2011) to set ψ = 0.82 (the Frisch elasticity for total hours supplied), we would
need to set σ ≈ 0.05, which is implausibly low. If instead we used the Frisch elasticity for the extensive
margin of labor supply in Chetty et al. (2011), ψ = 0.28, then the required σ would be even lower. If there
is compensation for trade shocks then income effects would be weaker and one could get a higher labor
supply elasticity – in the limit with perfect insurance  = ψ and this labor-supply approach could explain
the observed employment effects, but without any post-compensation distributional implications.
46
The only mention of distributional implications in Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014) is in regards
to Burstein and Vogel (2016), which is limited to quantifying welfare effects among low and high skilled
workers.

plausible measures of inequality aversion social welfare still improves as a consequence
of the China shock.
The question addressed in this paper is complex and our approach has obvious limitations. Most importantly, our analysis adheres to the tradition in the trade literature
and uses a static model with a competitive labor market and a perfectly inelastic labor
supply. Thus, we do not address some of the features that have been highlighted in
the empirical literature, most importantly the effects on employment. As mentioned
earlier, it seems useful to explore how allowing for some kind of labor-market friction
could generate involuntary unemployment in response to a trade shock, as in Carrère
et al. (2015) or Coşar et al. (2016). More research on this topic is clearly needed.

Data description

Our group-level labor market data is obtained from the 2000 Census and American
Community Survey (ACS).47 Both datasets are downloaded from IPUMS using standardized variables. Our labor market data for the year 2000 is derived from a 5% sample
of the 2000 Census. For the year 2011, labor market figures are based on ACS data. We
exclude unpaid family workers, and employees that work in non-profits or any branch
of the government (i.e. federal, state or local governments or the armed forces). We
also exclude data from Alaska and Hawaii. Our measure of earnings includes all earned
income over the past 12 months.
For the model extension on costly within-US trade in Section 7.2, we use data from
the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS). Since the CFS is only collected every five years, we
use the CFS from 2002 and 2012 for the first and second period respectively. Using the
CFS, we construct trade data between all US states and all other countries in the WIOD
CF S , which denotes exports from state n to
sample. To this end, we use the variable Xnms

state m in sector s, as observed in the CFS.
First, in order to construct exports of US states to other WIOD countries define
P
CF S ≡
CF S
state-level production in sector s as Yns
m∈U S Xnms and calculate production
shares as

CF S
Yns
.
CF S
m∈U S Yms

µns ≡ P

IOD be the exports from the US to destination country j in sector s, obNext, let XUWSjs

served in WIOD. We then infer exports from state n to destination country j in sector s
as
IOD
Xnjs = µns XUWSjs
.

Second, in order to construct imports of US states from other WIOD countries, deP
CF S ≡
CF S
fine state-level expenditures in sector s as Ems
n∈U S Xnms and construct expenditure shares as

CF S
Ems

The ACS is designed to be comparable to the Census.

We then infer imports from state m from origin country i in sector s as
W IOD
Xims = θms XiU
Ss .

Finally, to construct exports and imports vis-a-vis other states, we need to scale the
CFS flows to match the WIOD trade values. To this end, define the “intra-US trade
factor” as
XU SU Ss

CF S
n∈U S Yns

The only solution to this system is ŵis = 1 for all s, but we know that this is not possible.

This establishes a contradiction and shows that if g πigs yig 6= βis for some s then zis 6=

Given wages, this equation represents a system of N × S equations in Pjs for all j and s,
which can be used to solve for Pjs and hence cis and λijs given wages. This implies that
trade shares are an implicit function of wages. Letting Xjs and Rjs be total expenditure

Douglas preferences and technologies imply that Xjs = βjs (Yj + Dj ) + Sk=1 αjsk Rjk ,
