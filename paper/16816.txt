ABSTRACT
We examine the role of generalized constant gain stochastic gradient (SGCG) learning in generating
large deviations of an endogenous variable from its rational expectations value. We show analytically
that these large deviations can occur with a frequency associated with a fat tailed distribution even
though the model is driven by thin tailed exogenous stochastic processes. We characterize these large
deviations that are driven by sequences of consistently low or consistently high shocks. We then apply
our model to the canonical asset-pricing model. We demonstrate that the tails of the stationary distribution
of the price-dividend ratio will follow a power law.

Introduction
Dynamic stochastic models have at times di¢ culty matching some features of macro-

economic data.1 One route to reconcile di¤erences between data and theory has been to
replace the assumption of rational expectations with that of adaptive learning, where agents
are assumed to estimate the underlying parameters of a model via recursive least squares.
For example, if the monetary authority adaptively learns the underlying Phillips curve via
decreasing gain least squares regressions, then the Nash outcome is the one that is selected
(see Evans and Honkapohja (2001)). Still, the U.S. economy escaped the high in‡ation of the
1970’s predicted by the standard model with decreasing gains. To provide an explanation
Sargent (1999) and Cho et al. (2002) assumed instead that a monetary authority estimates a
misspeci…ed Phillips curve using constant gain algorithms that place more weight on recent
observations. This assumption allowed the possibility of escape from a Nash outcome to a low
in‡ation (Ramsey) outcome. In particular, within the context of their endogenous tracking
model, a sequence of otherwise rare shocks can cause frequent large deviations from a high
in‡ation self-con…rming equilibrium. Indeed Sargent et al. (2006) take these endogenous
tracking models to the data and account for the behavior of in‡ation in the U.S.
Our analysis also focuses on the role of large deviations theory and its interplay with
constant gain learning dynamics. Speci…cally, working within the adaptive learning tradition
set out by Sargent and Williams (2005), Evans et al. (2010) and others, we examine the role
of generalized constant gain stochastic gradient (SGCG) learning algorithms in generating

pricing puzzles, and evaluations of real business cycle models cannot typically account for the pattern of
hours worked without appealing to labor supply elasticities that are often at odds with microeconometric
evidence.

large deviations of an endogenous variable from its rational expectations value. We show
analytically that these large deviations can occur with a frequency associated with a fat tailed
distribution even though the model is driven by thin tailed exogenous stochastic processes.
Using some new techniques in the analysis of stochastic processes and linear recursions with
multiplicative noise2 , we characterize these large deviations occurring under adaptive learning
that are driven by sequences of consistently low or consistently high shocks. Such sequences
are rare in that the average of realizations in the sequences can signi…cantly diverge from
the population mean of the shocks. We then apply our model to the single asset version of
the canonical model of Lucas (1978) that has been studied extensively by Carceles-Poveda
and Giannitsarou (2007, 2008) who look at the ability of learning models to approximate
the behavior of aggregate stock market data.
A particular issue in the modi…cation of standard rational expectations models to better
account for features of the data by introducing adaptive learning is the choice of the learning
algorithm itself. Typically, in replacing the rational expectations assumption with that of
adaptive learning, agents are assumed to estimate parameters of processes to be forecasted
using recursive (adaptive) methods.3 A particular strain of this literature demonstrates the
consistency of this approach with Bayes’ Law. In a stationary model with optimal learning, estimated parameters ultimately converge to their rational expectations equilibrium. In
recent work however, Sargent and Williams (2005) introduce a model where agents expect
a random walk drift in estimated parameters. They then show that the SGCG algorithm,

that assigns more weight to recent observations on account of the underlying drift in the estimated parameters, is asymptotically the optimal Bayesian estimator. Evans et al. (2010)
follow Sargent and Williams (2005) and show how a SGCG learning algorithm approximates
an optimal (in a Bayesian sense) Kalman …lter. Under such adaptive SGCG learning, uncertainty about estimated parameters persists over time and can fuel escape dynamics in
which a sequence of consistently high or consistently low shocks propel agents away from
the REE of a model.4 In an asset-pricing context Weitzman (2007) also shows that if recent
observations are given more weight under Bayesian learning of the variance of the consumption growth rate, agents will forecast returns and asset prices using thick-tailed distributions
for consumption growth.5 It is for this reason that we focus on an asset pricing context to
analytically demonstrate how SGCG learning, consistent with optimal Bayesian learning,
can account for the data features and fat tailed distributions of the price-dividend ratio.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that under adaptive learning of the asset prices, the tails
of the stationary distribution of the price-dividend ratio will follow a power law, even though
the dividend process has thin tails and is speci…ed as a stationary AR(1) process. The tail
index or power-law coe¢ cient of the price-dividend ratio can be expressed as a function of
model parameters, and in particular of the optimal gain parameter that assigns decaying
weights to older observations. In fact, as demonstrated by Sargent and Williams (2005)
4

See also Holmstrom (1999) for an application to managerial incentives of learning with an underlying
drift in parameters.
5
See also Koulovatianos and Wieland (2011). They adopt the notion of rare disasters studied by Barro
(2009) in a Bayesian learning environment. They …nd that volatility issues are well addressed. Similarly
Chevillon and Mavroeidis (2011) …nd that giving more weight to recent observations under learning can
generate low frequency variability observed in the data. See also Gabaix (2009) who provides an excellent
summary of instances in which economic data follow power laws and suggests a number of causes of such laws
for …nancial returns. In particular, Gabaix et al. (2006) suggest that large trades in illiquid asset markets
on the part of institutional investors could generate extreme behavior in trading volumes (usually predicted
to be zero in Lucas-type environments) and returns.

and more recently by Evans et al. (2010), the optimal gain depends on the variance of the
underlying drift in the estimated parameters: the higher the variance of the drift parameter,
the higher the gain, and the thicker the tail of the distribution of the price-dividend ratio.
We characterize how the power law tail index of the of the long-run stationary distribution
of the price-dividend ratio varies as a function of the gain parameter and of the other deep
parameters of the model. Under our adaptive learning scheme that approximates optimal
Bayesian learning, stationary dividend processes generate distributions for the price-dividend
ratio that are not Normal. Thus, large deviations of the price-dividends ratio from the
rational expectations equilibrium are possible with a frequency higher than that associated
with a Normal distribution even though the dividend process is thin-tailed.
Our analysis and simulations indicate that under standard parameter calibrations, to
match either the empirical tail index or the variance of the annual “fat-tailed”price dividend
ratio, we require a gain parameter around 0:4-0:55, signi…cantly higher than what is typically
used in the adaptive learning literature (0:01-0:04). Carceles-Poveda and Giannitsarou (2008)
also employ large parameter values for the gain in asset pricing contexts, as do Branch and
Evans (2010). The latter implicitly assumes slowly decaying weights on past observations,
and therefore very little underlying drift in the parameters estimated by agents. In order
to get an empirical handle on the gain parameter we estimate the parameters of our model,
including the gain parameter, by two separate methods. The …rst is a structural minimum
distance estimation method for the tail index. This method puts higher weight on the
empirically observed tail of the price-dividend ratio, and produces a gain estimate in the
range of 0:35-0:53. The second method computes the gain as Bayesian agents expecting
drifting parameters would, using a Kalman …lter on the data. This yields a gain parameter
4

in the range of 0:49-0:55, assigning decaying weights on past observations that take the
parameter drift into account. Therefore agents who use this gain parameter would indeed
have their expectations con…rmed by the data.
The paper is structured as follows. We …rst describe the general dynamic stochastic
equation under learning, and also brie‡y illustrate its application to the single asset pricing
version of Lucas (1978). Then in Section 3 we prove that our learning model, written as a
random linear recursion with multiplicative noise, predicts that the tails of the stationary
distribution of the endogenous variable of interest, in our application the price-dividends
ratio, will follow a power law with coe¢ cient
Section 4 we use simulations to study how

that is a function of model parameters. In
varies with the deep parameters. In Section 5

we provide estimates of the deep parameters of the model for our asset pricing application,
and of the gain parameter in particular, that are consistent with the

estimated directly

from the price-dividends ratio. Section 6 concludes.

Model Environment
We focus on models of the type

pt = Et (pt+1 ) + dt

(1)

in which the exogenous driving process dt follows

dt = dt

where "t is an iid(0;

) random variable (such that

2

< +1) with compact support

[ a; a], a > 0. Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001) consider di¤erent economic environments that also give rise to such speci…cations.
The assumption that the exogenous process for dt has compact support is not very restrictive and clearly highlights our result: while the stationary distribution of an exogenous
driving process has thin tails, the stationary distribution of the related endogenous variable
may have fat tails, a result also characterized as “thin tails in, thick tails out”. Furthermore,
the assumption of compact support for "t makes it easy to show that the autoregressive
exogenous process is uniformly recurrent over its stationary distribution. The assumption of
uniform recurrence simpli…es proofs and is further discussed in detail in the next section.
Anticipating our empirical application, we brie‡y provide an asset pricing interpretation
for the model in (1)-(2). Following Lucas (1978), a single asset endowment economy with
utility over consumption given by

u(Ct ) =

where all lowercase variables denote log-deviations from the steady state (P ; D) =

pt = Et (pt+1 ) + dt ;

7

We note that in the asset pricing context, the ALM is linear in the ‘belief’ parameter ( t ). In other
contexts the ALM might be nonlinear in beliefs. However, the linear forces generating large deviations in
the adaptive learning model may drive the dynamics in nonlinear contexts. For example in Cho et al. (2002)
adaptive learning leads to non-neglible probablities for large deviations even in the prescence of nonlinearities
for the true data generating process.

can be fat-tailed and indeed follows a power law even though the forcing variable (dt ) is

a thin tailed process. Under the asset pricing application this implies that the price-dividend
ratio ( t ) can exhibit large deviations from its rational expectations equilibrium value with
non-negligible probabilities.

3.

Large Deviations and Rare Events
As noted,

t

is a random variable generating multiplicative noise, and our main result is

that it can be the source of large deviations and fat tails for the stationary distribution of
t.

There are two elements that are absolutely critical for this result. First, the distribution

of the random variable

must have Ej j < 1 or a stationary distribution fails to exist (see

Brandt (1986)). Second, for

t

to have a fat tail even if the exogenous driving process, the

dividends, are thin tailed, we need the distribution of
circle: P (j j > 1) > 0. Since the distribution of

t

to have some support above the unit

is governed by the exogenous process for

dt we will need some restrictions on fdt gt2N as discussed below. In particular in section 5.
9

where we will apply our results to the asset pricing model and characterize the price-dividend
ratio, these restrictions will apply to the stationary distribution of dividends.
We use results from large deviation theory (see Hollander (2000)) together with the work
of Saporta (2005), Roitershtein (2007) and Collamore (2009) to characterize the tail of the
distribution of
fdt gt2N

(see
given by (2) is uniformly recurrent, and has compact support D = 1 ; 1

Nummelin (1984), p. 93).10 We use the uniform recurrence of fdt gt2N in step (ii) of the
proof of 1 below to show that j j > 1 with positive probability, or P! (j j > 1) > 0, which is
essential to obtain fat tails for f t g.11
Next we seek restrictions on the support of the iid noise "t 2 [ a; a] to ensure that
Ej

is the random variable associated with the sta-

tionary distribution of dt . For simplicity, in order to derive restrictions on a that assures
Ej

1j

< 1 we assume that "t is uniformly distributed. We could just as easily have assumed

another distribution, for example a triangular distribution, or even another skewed distribution over [ a; a], and sought restrictions on its support, or a; to ensure that E j

1j

< 1. The

uniform distribution leads to easy computations, and makes it quite clear that it is not the
skewness or the tails of the distribution of "t that drive our results on the tails of distribution
9

For an application of these techniques to the distribution of wealth see Benhabib et al. (2011) and to
regime switching, Benhabib (2010).

To de…ne uniformly recurrent let (X; X ) be a measurable space and de…ne B P m (x; A) =
P (Xn 2 A; Xi 2
= B; m = 1; :::m 1) : A chain fXn g is uniformly '-recurrent if for all A 2 X with ' (A) > 0;
if limn nm=1 A P m (x; A) = 1 holds uniformly in x. That is, for all " > 0 there exists N such that for
all x 2 X and n
N; nm=1 A P m (x; A) = 1 " (see Petritis (2012, Chapter 11)). To assure that the
AR (1) process fdt gt2Z is uniformly recurrent we also assume that the distribution of "t is not a singular
(see Nummelin (1984, p. 92)). This is a very weak requirement: a probability distribution is singular on Rn
if it is concentrated on a set of Lebesgue measure zero and gives probability zero to every one-point set. An
example on R1 would be the Cantor distribution, a probability distribution over a Cantor set.

This requirement of uniform recurrence can be weakened, as discussed in Collamore (2009) in more
detail, but proofs would become more cumbersome.

The Proposition above characterizes the tail of the stationary distribution of
power tail with exponent . It follows that the distribution of

as a

has moments only up to

the highest integer less than , and is a ‘fat tailed’distribution rather than a Normal. The
results are driven by the fact that the stationary distribution of f t gt2N has a mean less
20

In models where the driving stochastic process is iid or is a …nite stationary Markov chain, the exponent
can be analytically derived using the results of Kesten (1973) and Saporta (2005 ). In the case where is
iid in equation (14), solves E ( ) = 1. In the …nite Markov chain case, under appropriate assumptions,
solves & (P A ) = 1 where P is the transition matrix, A is a diagonal matrix of the states of the Markov
chain assumed to be non-negative, and & (P A ) is the dominant root of P A .

than one, which tends to induce a contraction towards zero, but also has support above 1
with positive probability, which tends to generate divergence towards in…nity. The stationary
distribution arises out of a balance between these two forces. Then large deviations as strings
of realizations of

t

above one, even though they may be rare events, can produce fat tails.

In the asset price model

relates the dividends to asset prices. Under adaptive learning,

the results above show how the probability distribution of large deviations, or ‘escapes’of
from its REE value is characterized by a fat tailed distribution, and will occur with higher
likelihood than under a Normal.21
We now brie‡y discuss the case where fdt gt is an M A(1) process. Proposition 1 still
applies and we obtain similar results to the AR(1) case. Let

Model Simulations and Comparative Statics
The theoretical results above indicate that, in the context of a simple asset pricing model,

rare but large shocks to the exogenous dividend process can throw o¤ forecasts for the pricedividend ratio away from its rational expectation value. Of course escapes are more likely
if the variance of the shocks to dividends are high. More critically, escapes in the long-run
are possible if agents put a large weight on recent observations and discount older ones.
The decay of the weights on past observations depends on the gain parameter g.22 The
size of the Bayesian optimal g will in turn depend on the drift that agents expect in the
estimated parameter . We will estimate g in the next section, both directly, and also from
the perspective of Bayesian agents expecting a random walk drift in .
In this section we explore how

is related to the underlying parameters of our model. We

can simulate the learning algorithm that updates , and then estimate

from the simulated

data using a maximum likelihood procedure following Clauset et al. (2009). We can then
explore how
5000, for

t

varies as we vary model parameters. We simulate 1000 series, each of length
under the AR(1) assumption for dividends with iid uniform shocks. We then

feed the simulated series into the model to produce fPt g and fPt =Dt g. We estimate

for

each simulation and produce an average .
Escapes or large deviations in prices will take place when sequences of consistently large
shocks to dividends (in absolute value) throw o¤ the learning process away from the rational
expectations equilibrium. Such escapes will be more likely if dividend shocks can produce

Under constant gains the decay in weights on past observations dating i periods back is given by

values of

t

above 1, as we can see from equations (14-16). We expect lower , or fatter tails,

as the support of

t

that lies above 1 gets larger.

In the AR(1) case for dividends we have

stationary distribution of fdt gt and that of f"t gt , the support of

) declines and tends to raise

t

t

above 1 unambiguously

can have an ambiguous e¤ect: while the

for realizations of dt and "t+1 , the support of the

stationary distribution of fdt gt gets bigger with higher . While this can increase (1
and reduce the support of

)gd2t

that is above 1 for large realizations of d2t , in our simulations the

former e¤ect seems to dominate. Finally we expect that decreasing g will shrink the support
of

t

that is above 1 so that

increases with g: as the gain parameter decreases, the tails of

the stationary distribution of f t g get thinner.23
We use a baseline parameterization, ( ; g; ; ) = (0:80; 0:4; 0:95; 2:5) based on estimates
that we obtain in the next section. The estimated parameters, except for g, are in line with
standard calibrations. The discount factor of

= 0:95 is consistent with annual data and an

annual discount rate of about 5%. While empirical estimates of g are hard to come by, the
usual values of g used in theoretical models are much smaller, in the order of 0:01 or 0:04,
suggesting a very slow decay in the weights attached to past observations. Values of g in the
range of 0:3-0:5 indicate a high decay rate, suggesting a propensity for the agents to think
that “this time it’s di¤erent”. As noted above, we attempt to estimate g in the context of
23

This of course is in accord with the Theorem 7.9 in Evans and Honkapohja (2001). As the gain parameter
g ! 0 and tg ! 1, f gt {g =g 0:5 converges to a Gaussian variable where { is the globally stable point of
the associated ODE describing the mean dynamics. More generally, as g ! 0, the estimated coe¢ cient under
learning with gain parameter g, gt , converges in probability (but not uniformly) to { for t ! 1. However,
there will always exist arbitrarily large values of t with gt taking values remote from { (see Benveniste et
al. (1980), pp. 42-45). Note however that our characterization of the tail of the stationary distribution of
f t gt and of is obtained for …xed g > 0.

21

our model by two separate methods in the next section. However, as the comparative statics
in Figure 2 below demonstrate, for the learning model to explain the fat tails and the high
variance of the P=D ratio, the gain parameter has to be large enough. This also implies, as
discussed further in the next section, that the expected drift in the estimated parameters
should have a large variance.
For a parametrization based on the asset pricing model, we set the value of a = 0:33
to match the standard deviation of linearly detrended dividends in the data. We …nd that
the average

is 5:0210, the average price-dividend ratio (Pt =Dt ) is 20:6274 and the average

standard deviation of (Pt =Dt ) is 9:8934. We then vary each element of ( ; g; ; ; ) while
keeping the others at their baseline values. The results of varying each parameter around
the baseline values are plotted in Figures 1 and 2 below.24

Figure 1. Simulation Results.
24

The restriction given by equation (17) implies a maximum value of a = a
^ = 4:2733, the corresponding
value for quarterly data would be 3:9933 (see the Quarterly Frequency Results Appendix). For all parameter
values used to produce Figures 1 and 2, the restriction is easily satis…ed.

22

Figure 2. Simulation Results (cont’d.).

The simulation results con…rm the notion that the average ’s should decline with ,
and a. Figure 2 plots the results of the critical learning parameter g; it clearly demonstrates
that as the learning gain falls, that is, the horizon for learning increases, the average
rises. In summary, SGCG learning leads to large deviations of (Pt =Dt ) from its rational
expectations value even though the exogenous driving process for dividends is thin-tailed.

5.

An Empirical Application
Figures 3-4 plot aggregate annual stock prices and dividends in the U.S. as measured by

the S&P 500 and CRSP datasets. The plots show that, as predicted by standard theory,
prices and dividends do move in tandem. However the price-dividend ratio, shown in the
third panel of each Figure, exhibits large ‡uctuations, especially in the latter parts of the

23

sample.25 These large ‡uctuations in the price-dividend ratio are di¢ cult to explain with
the standard rational expectations asset pricing model, for example that of Lucas (1978).26

Whenever we employ actual dividends series, we linearly detrend (see DeJong and Dave (2011)). Note
also that the dividends data have a higher standard deviation than that which is obtained only with post
WWII data. This is because our data series also capture the Great Depression, and in the case of the S&P
500, the higher volatility in stock prices subsequent to the U.S. Civil War.

25

We use two separate approaches to get estimates for the gain parameter g. First we
feed the actual S&P and CRSP dividend series into our learning model and estimate the
parameters, # = [g

] by minimizing the squared di¤erence between the empirical ’s

reported in Table 1 and those generated by our model. That is, we implement a simulated
minimum distance method to estimate # as28

(#)]2 :

min [
#

(40)

This estimation process necessarily puts a great deal of emphasis on the tail of the
empirical data given by . Since the puzzle lies in the fat tail and high variance of P=D,
emphasizing the tail in the estimation method may be justi…ed. The parameter estimates
other than g are certainly in line with basic calibrations in the literature, but the value of
g, as expected from our model, is higher than the usual values of 0:01-0:04 that we …nd in
the literature.
The minimization procedure is as follows. For candidate parametrizations of # we employ
the S&P 500 or CRSP series dividends dt to calculate

t

as per (14)-(16). The ALM (10)

then produces a corresponding pt series which in turn delivers a price-dividend ratio Pt =Dt .
We then estimate the

associated with the ‘simulated’Pt =Dt , using the methods of Clauset

et al. (2009) to produce the (#). The minimization procedure searches over the parameter
space of # to implement (40). Table 2 below reports the estimates and associated standard
errors for each of the S&P 500 or CRSP dividend series. We also report associated
28

values

Minimization was conducted using a simplex method and standard errors were computed using a standard inverse Hessian method.

The point estimates of g, ranging from 0:35 to 0:53 are high, although the standard
errors are quite large, especially in the case of the S & P 500 dataset. The high estimates
for the gain parameter g, which imply a fat tail for the price dividend ratio, re‡ect the fat
tail (or low ) that we observe in the data in Table 1, as expected. Standard errors are
signi…cantly smaller when we construct and use longer quarterly data.30 Carceles-Poveda
and Giannitsarou (2008) discuss possible values of g. Looking at standard deviations of
the price-dividend ratios for the Lucas asset pricing model, they report that the standard
deviations generated by the rational expectations or the learning models are smaller than the
standard deviations in the actual data by factors of about 20 to 50. Note that our estimates
of the parameter values, including g, are very close to those used by Carceles-Poveda and
Giannitsarou (2008) in their simulations except for , the CRRA parameter: they set
= 1 while we have it at

Starting values for the minimization procedure were #0 = [0:5 2:5 0:95 0:75].

drops

dramatically with .
For our second approach to pin down the gain parameter we let the agent optimally
determine g by estimating the standard deviations of the parameter drift, the noise in the
P=D ratio, and the shock to the dividend process.31 Recall that under SGCG learning

t

evolves as
t

=

t 1

+ gdt 1 (pt

t 1 dt 1 );

g 2 (0; 1)

(41)

Consider the case in which the agents assume that the PLM is

(42)

drifting according to a random walk:

t

=

t 1

+

t;

t

iid(0;

);

In this case, the Bayesian agent would use (41) to estimate

2

< +1:

,

d

and

(43)

and set an optimal

estimate of the gain in the limit as
d

g=

where

d

(44)

denotes the standard deviation of dt (see Evans et al (2010)). Under this approach,

the long-run value of g that generates fpg and f g under adaptive learning would be selfcon…rming, in the sense that agents would in fact estimate g using (44).
31

See Sargent et al. (2006) and others for a more complex version of this approach for models requiring
dynamic tracking estimation.

28

To compute (44) an estimate of

d

is of course readily obtained from the dividend data.

However we need to specify a method for the agents to compute estimates of

and

. If

we recognize the system above as being analogous to a time varying parameter formulation,
then employing the methods laid out in Kim and Nelson (1999) we can obtain estimates of
and

.32 We report these results in Table 3 below.

These estimates suggest values of the gain signi…cantly larger than those usually assumed
in the literature.33 Looking at Figure 2, a value of g = 0:4866 yields a tail estimate
4:9 while a value of g = 0:5455 yields a

of about 4:75, compared to

of about

in the data ranging

from 3:7 to 5:5 in Table 1. We also simulated the model with baseline parameter values but
with gains of 0:4866 and 0:5455. These simulations resulted in average price-dividend ratios
of 20:6324 and 20:6965 respectively with corresponding standard deviation values of 10:0051
and 10:5870.
32

Given our estimate of = 0:95 we convert the CRSP data to annual, summing dividends quarterly
dividends for each year. For the S&P 500 we use the annual data reported by Shiller (1999), pp.439-441.
33
We also apply block bootstrap methods to this estimation, detailed at the end of the Quarterly Frequency
Results appendix. These methods allow us to construct average associated g’s with attendant standard
deviations, instead of the associated g in the last row of Table 3.

29

Finally, instead of using actual P and D data series, we generate data by simulating
our model with our benchmark values ( ; g; ; ) = (0:80; 0:4; 0:95; 2:5), and then compute
g from (44) using the methods in Kim and Nelson (1999) to check that we recover a value
close to 0:4.34 The average g is 0:3826, which is quite close to and con…rms the benchmark
value of g = 0:4 that we used in generating the simulated data. In fact we conducted these
simulations for a range of values of the gain parameter and then computed the associated
average g value. Our prior was that the resulting plot would intersect near a gain value
which was near g = 0:4; we provide the plot in Figure 5 below and note that our prior was
con…rmed.

Figure 5. Fixed Point Plot.
34

We run 1000 simulations each with 5000 periods, and obtain the average g from (44) across the 1000
simulations.

30

Given these results, we o¤er a caveat with respect to interpretation of the large gain
parameter estimates that we …nd. One approach is to say that the model with SGCG
learning does very well in matching features of the data given the gain parameter estimates.
Alternatively one could argue that absent large estimates for the gain, the model does not
do well in matching asset pricing facts. We prefer the former interpretation given that it is
entirely reasonable to interpret our empirical exercise as suggesting that heavily discounting
past observations is consistent with market participants’ behavior. With annual data the
estimates suggest market participants’horizon for learning is about 2-3 years which is not
entirely unreasonable given the frequent swings in the data.

6.

Conclusion
An important and growing literature replaces expectations in dynamic stochastic models

not with realizations and unforecastable errors, but with regressions where agents ‘learn’
the rational expectations equilibria (REE). In these adaptive learning models when agents
employ constant gain algorithms that put heavier emphasis on recent observations and shown
to be optimal when there is drift in estimated parameters, escape dynamics can propel
estimated coe¢ cients away from the REE values. We show that in a constant gain adaptive
learning model, the stationary distribution of the variables that agents are learning can be
fat tailed, and that the tail index of this distribution can be characterized in terms of the
parameters of the model.
We then analyze, in an asset pricing context, the stationary distribution of the pricedividend ratio in a canonical model with constant gain adaptive learning. We reinterpret

31

the learning algorithm as a linear recursion with multiplicative noise and use techniques
from large deviations theory to characterize the tail of the stationary distribution of the
price-dividend ratio.
In an asset pricing context ‘bubbles’, or asset price to dividend ratios that exhibit large
deviations from their REE values (even though our model has presumed a no-bubble condition) can occur with a frequency associated with a fat tailed power law, as observed in
the data. The techniques used in our paper can be generalized to higher dimensions, to
…nite state Markov chains, to continuous time,35 and can be applied more generally to other

Data Appendix

1. Annual S&P 500 Dataset from Professor Shiller’s website (see Shiller (2005))
(a) The following time series are extracted/constructed for 1871 through 2009 (note
that t = 1; : : : T where T = 2009:12):
i. Extract S & P Comp (Pe(t)).

e
ii. Extract Dividend (D(t)).

iii. Extract Consumer Price Index (CP I(t)).
iv. Construct Real Price (P (t)) as P (t) = [Pe(t)

CP I(T )]=CP I(t).

e
v. Construct Real Dividend (D(t)) as D(t) = [D(t)

CP I(T )]=CP I(t).

(b) Construct the Price to Dividends Ratio (ratio) as P (t)=D(t).
2. Quarterly CRSP Dataset
(a) Download the quarterly data from http://scholar.harvard.edu/campbell/data accessed from Professor Campbell’s website, where the particular data being used is
associated with “Replication Data for: Consumption Based Asset Pricing”. The
relevant …le is titled USAQE.ASC, note that this is e¤ectively a CRSP dataset
with the relevant variables being VWRETD and VWRETX. The text below is
an extract from the explanations for this dataset on the above website.
(b) The following quarterly time series are extracted/constructed for 1926.1 through
1998.4 from the above dataset (note that t = 1; : : : T where T = 1998:4):
i. Extract Col. 2: Pe(t). For each month, the price index is calculated as
Pe(t) = (V W RET X(t) + 1)

Pe(t

1). (Note that time t in this equation is

in months.) The price index for a quarter, as reported in this column, is the
price index for the last month of the quarter. The original data, which goes
up to 1996.4 was not altered. The new data, which goes up to 1998.4, was
created as described here starting from 1997.1.
e
ii. Extract Col. 3: D(t).
Dividend in local currency, calculated as follows. The

g (t) = [1+V W RET D(t)]=[1+
dividend yield for each month is calculated as DY

V W RET X(t)] 1. Note that if the return index is calculated from V W RET D
as above, then this formula agrees with the formula for the dividend yield
e =
given earlier. As before, the dividend for each month is calculated as D(t)
g (t)
DY

Pe(t). The dividend for a quarter, as reported in this column, is the

sum of the dividends for the three months comprising the quarter.

iii. Extract the Consumer Price Index from Shiller’s Monthly Data (CP I(t))
which is monthly and associate the last month of a quarter as a quarterly
CP I(t).
iv. Construct Real Price (P (t)) as P (t) = [Pe(t)

CP I(T )]=CP I(t). Take the

last price of a quarter as the annual price.

e
v. Construct Real Dividend (D(t)) as [D(t)

CP I(T )]=CP I(t) and then take

quarterly sums to get D(t) at an annual frequency.

vi. Construct the Price to Dividends Ratio (ratio) as P (t)=D(t).

Quarterly Frequency Results
We also considered quarterly versions of the data. Quarterly data for the S&P 500 were

constructed from the monthly series reported by Professor Shiller on his website. Quarterly
data for the CRSP series were directly available from the data website maintained by Professor Campbell (Campbell (2003)). The plots, analogous to Figures 3 and 4 in the text but
for quarterly data are as follows.

Figure 6. Quarterly S & P 500 (1871-2010).

40

Figure 7. Quarterly CRSP (1926-1998).
Both datasets indicate that at the quarterly frequency the price-dividends ratio is quite
volatile, just as in the case with annual data discussed in the text. Next, we employed a
baseline parameterization of ( ; g; ; ) = (0:98; 0:5; 0:99; 2:5) consistent with quarterly data
(e.g. a

= 0:98) and conducted the same simulations as reported in the text above, the

plots, analogous to Figures 1 and 2 in the text, are as follows.

Next, our minimum distance estimates analogous to those Tables 1-3 in the text, except
employing quarterly data, are as follows.

The main results from employing data at a quarterly frequency are twofold. First, while
the gain estimates reported in Table 5 fall, it still remains the case that the data exhibit
fat tails. This is expected since the data are now at a quarterly frequency. A higher gain
or shorter memory with annual data does indeed correspond to a lower gain and longer
memory with quarterly data since the de…nition of the learning horizon (the inverse of the
43

gain) changes from years to quarters. Second, employing data at a quarterly frequency leads
to the structural estimates (as reported in Table 5) being estimated with greater precision.
In fact with more data the surface over which a minimum is sought in the minimum distance
estimation procedure is sharply de…ned, leading to the increased precision of the estimates.
In contrast to Table 5 however, for Table 6 the CRSP data employed in the drifting beliefs
speci…cation lead to a larger than expected gain. This is driven by a much higher estimate
for

relative to the annual data.
Finally, we also implemented a block bootstrap in estimating the drifting beliefs model.

That is, we used a block bootstrap to generate 1000 samples from the data, each of which was
used to estimate the parameters of a drifting beliefs model with an attendant computation of
g from equation (44), for example, as reported in the last row of Table 6. This yielded 1000
estimates of g for which we then computed the mean and standard deviation. Such estimates
yielded a mean (standard deviation) of g of 0.5080 (0.1777) using quarterly CRSP data and
a mean (standard deviation) of g of 0.6114 (0.1362) when using S&P 500 data. With annual
data the estimates of g were 0.2095 (0.1788) using CRSP data and 0.2196 (0.1788) using
S&P 500 data. Thus, with quarterly data using the minimum distance method or, using
bootstraps with either quarterly or annual data, the estimates of g were sharper and the
standard errors fell.
