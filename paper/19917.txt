ABSTRACT
The last 20 years have been marked by a sharp rise in international demand for U.S. reserve assets,
or safe stores-of-value. What are the welfare consequences to U.S. households of these trends, or of
a reversal? In a lifecycle model with aggregate and idiosyncratic risks, the young and oldest households
may benefit substantially from such capital inflows, but middle-aged savers may suffer from greater
exposure to systematic risk in equity and housing markets. Under the veil of ignorance, a newborn
in the lowest wealth quantile is willing to forego 2.7% of lifetime consumption to avoid a large capital
outflow.

Introduction

The last 20 years have been marked by a sharp rise in international demand for U.S. reserve
assets, or safe stores-of-value. This has led to an unprecedented degree of foreign ownership of
U.S. government and government-backed debt, most of it held by Foreign O¢ cial Institutions
such as central banks. In 1994, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries amounted to 17% of
marketable Treasuries outstanding. By the end of 2008, foreigners owned 51% of all U.S.
federal government debt.1 These trends have raised questions about the sustainability of
large “global imbalances” between the demand for and supply of U.S. reserve assets, and
they have invited speculation over the possible economic consequences of a sell-o¤ of U.S.
debt by foreign governments.2
An important aspect of these trends is that foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities
has been dominated by Foreign O¢ cial Institutions (FOIs), namely foreign governmental
entities such as central banks. Because these institutions face political, legal, and regulatory
restrictions on the types of assets they can hold, their motivations for saving are quite
di¤erent from those of private investors. FOIs take extremely inelastic positions in U.S. safe
assets, implying that when they receive funds to invest, they buy U.S. Treasuries regardless
of price (Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2007)). Foreign o¢ cial ‡ows have also
been found to be the main driver of uphill capital ‡ows, which are not well described by
two-country neoclassical models of private optimizing agents (Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan, and
Volosovych (2011)). Likewise, Aguiar and Amador (2011) emphasize that uphill ‡ows are
mainly driven by government net assets, not private ‡ows.3 Indeed, the persistent and
growing U.S. trade de…cits since 1994 have been …nanced almost exclusively by an upward
trend in net foreign holdings by foreign governments of U.S. assets considered to be safe
stores-of-value. By contrast, net foreign holdings of risky securities have ‡uctuated near

Despite a vigorous academic debate on the question of whether global imbalances are a
fundamentally benign or detrimental phenomenon,4 little is known about the potential welfare consequences of foreign governmental ownership of U.S. safe assets. This paper analyzes
the welfare consequences of these ‡ows for U.S. households. We argue here that a complete
understanding of the welfare implications requires a model with realistic heterogeneity, lifecycle dynamics, and plausible …nancial markets. We study a two-sector model of housing
and non-housing production where heterogeneous agents face limited opportunities to insure
against idiosyncratic and aggregate risks. A crucial source of aggregate risk in the model is
a shock to foreign ownership of the domestic riskless bond, calibrated to match U.S. data.
This shock a¤ects asset values and welfare because it alters the e¤ective supply of safe assets
available to domestic households.
The model economy we study implies that foreign purchases (or sales) of the safe asset
can have quantitatively large distributional consequences, re‡ecting sizable tradeo¤s between
generations, and between economic groups distinguished by wealth and income. The implications for domestic welfare are heavily in‡uenced by the endogenous response of asset markets
to ‡uctuations in foreign holdings of the safe asset. Foreign purchases of the safe asset act
like a positive economic shock and have an economically important downward impact on the
risk-free interest rate, consistent with empirical evidence.5 But although lower interest rates
boost output, equity and home prices, foreign purchases of the domestic riskless bond also
reduce the e¤ective supply of the safe asset, thereby exposing domestic savers to greater systematic risk in equity and housing markets. In response, risk premia on housing and equity
assets rise, substantially (but not fully) o¤setting the stimulatory impact of lower interest
rates on home and equity prices.
These factors imply that the young and the old experience welfare gains from a capital
in‡ow, while middle-aged savers su¤er. The young bene…t from higher wages and from lower
interest rates, which reduce the costs of home ownership and of borrowing in anticipation of

higher expected future income. But middle-aged savers are hurt because they are crowded
out of the safe bond market and exposed to greater systematic risk in equity and housing
markets. Although they are partially compensated for this in equilibrium by higher riskpremia, they still su¤er from lower expected rates of return on savings. By contrast, retired
individuals who are drawing down assets at the end of life experience a signi…cant net gain
from even modest increases in asset values that accompany a capital in‡ow.
The magnitude of these e¤ects for some individuals is potentially large. In the highest
quintile of the distribution of external leverage, the youngest working-age households would
be willing to give up about 0.2% of life time consumption in order to avoid just one year
of a typical annual decline in foreign holdings of the safe asset. This e¤ect could be several
times larger for a greater-than-typical decline, and many times larger for a series of annual
declines in succession or spaced over the remainder of the household’s lifetime. Under the
“veil of ignorance,”newborns typically bene…t from foreign purchases of the safe asset, unless
they are wealthy. Newborns at the 25th percentile of the net worth distribution would be
willing to forgo up to 2.7% of lifetime consumption in order to avoid a large capital out‡ow;
a median newborn bene…ts by less, while a newborn in the 75th percentile slightly prefers
out‡ows.
The nature of these results is closely related to the richness of the domestic model economy, in at least three ways. First, because time-varying risk premia play a key role in how
asset values respond to capital ‡ows, it is important that the model has both plausible heterogeneity and a non-trivial portfolio choice between risky and safe assets, which requires
modeling aggregate risk. Second, because domestic households (in aggregate) could undo
much of the impact of foreign purchases on U.S. interest rates by altering their saving behavior, it is important that domestic agents in the model optimally choose bond holdings,
rather than taking interest rates as exogenous. Third, because foreign ‡ows have important
e¤ects on collateral values and borrowing terms, it is important to explicitly account for
housing. For example, capital in‡ows could be welfare reducing for young households who
are …rst-time home buyers if they are forced to purchase assets at greatly elevated prices.
This channel is outweighed in our framework for all but the wealthiest households by the improved insurance opportunities that accompany an in‡ow, through the endogenous responses
3

of both the housing risk premium and housing supply, which together o¤set the stimulatory
impact of lower interest rates on home prices and limit the extent to which they can rise.
All of these factors have important e¤ects on welfare. While some model ingredients could
be dispensed with, our aim is to provide a quantitative welfare analysis, rather than a set of
qualitative results. A rich model is indispensable for our purposes.
This paper is related to the literature on global imbalances in international capital markets and, more loosely, to the literature on Sudden Stops, which studies reversals of international capital ‡ows in emerging economies.6 Caballero, Fahri, and Gourinchas (2008a),
Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009) (discussed further below), and Mendoza (2010) study
the economic consequences of capital in‡ows in representative agent economies, but do not
study the welfare outcomes of these ‡ows. A premise of this paper is that a complete understanding of the welfare implications requires a model with reasonable heterogeneity, life-cycle
dynamics, and plausible …nancial markets.
Our model is silent on the economic implications of gross ‡ows, and we do not study
cyclical ‡uctuations in the value of net foreign holdings of other securities which, unlike net
foreign holdings of U.S. safe assets, show no upward trend. By contrast, Gourinchas and
Rey (2007) and Maggiori (2011) investigate how the net foreign asset position of the U.S.
invested in risky securities varies cyclically across normal and “crisis”times, as well as how
gross ‡ows are a¤ected. But these papers are silent on the reasons for the large and growing
net foreign debtor position of the U.S. in good times, and on its upward trend over time.
We view these studies as complementary to ours.
Our model is also silent on the welfare consequences of the change in foreign holdings
of U.S. safe assets for the rest of the world. A complementary literature focuses on the
e¤ects in the countries from which the ‡ows originate. The implications for both domestic
and foreign households of global imbalances have been studied in models that are less rich
on the domestic side than the economy studied here, e.g., in models without aggregate
risk (Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull (2009)), or in models without household/worker
heterogeneity (Aguiar and Amador (2011)). We argue here that both heterogeneity and

aggregate risk are central to the welfare implications of these ‡ows. These papers also
generate foreign capital ‡ows as endogenous outcomes of a model with trade. Our focus here
is di¤erent. Rather than attempting to model the mechanics of the political economy and
trade adjustment that generate the right pattern of FOI ‡ows, we take the observed ‡ows
as given and study the implications for U.S. welfare. A bene…t of this approach is that we
can study a much richer model of the domestic economy, with clearer welfare implications
for U.S. households. A limitation is that we cannot make statements about global welfare.
The model in this paper builds on the incomplete markets model studied in Favilukis,
Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) (FLVN). FLVN do not study the welfare consequences of international capital ‡ows, as here. This requires introducing an additional
source of aggregate uncertainty, namely a shock to foreign holdings relative to output, which
cannot be insured away. This additional source of aggregate risk, which adds two new state
variables over which agents must form expectations, substantially complicates the model of
FLVN but has important implications both for asset markets and welfare.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the recent
history of foreign purchases of U.S. government securities, and how we model them. Section
3 describes the model, including the dynamics of foreign holdings of domestic bonds, the
equilibrium, the welfare measures, and the calibration. Section 4 presents the results, focusing on the macroeconomic, asset market, and welfare consequences of ‡uctuations in foreign
ownership of the domestic safe asset. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.

Modeling Recent Trends in Safe Asset Flows

This section provides a brief summary of some of the most salient features of recent trends
in international capital ‡ows to the U.S. We refer the reader to Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan, and
Volosovych (2011) and Favilukis, Kohn, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013) for a more
detailed discussion. We de…ne net foreign holdings of U.S. assets, or alternatively, as the
U.S. net liability position as the value of foreign holdings of U.S. assets minus U.S. holdings
of foreign assets. Figure 1 panel A shows that foreign ownership of U.S. Treasuries (Tbonds and T-notes) increased from $200 billion in 1984, or 14.6% of marketable Treasuries
5

outstanding, to $3.25 trillion in 2008, or 51% of marketable Treasuries. Foreign Treasury
holdings further grow to $5.6 trillion at the end of our sample in June 2013. Foreign holdings
of U.S. agency and Government Sponsored Enterprise-backed mortgage securities (referred
to as Agency debt hereafter) quintupled between 2000 and 2007, rising from $330 billion to
$1.4 trillion, or from 8% to 21% of total agency debt.

Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury

(short- and long-term) and long-term Agency debt as a fraction of trend GDP more than
doubled from 13.7% to 29.2% over the period 2000-2008 and stands at 39.4% at the end of
our sample in 2013Q2.
Panel B of Figure 1 shows the fraction of foreign holdings relative to trend U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP) over time. The …gure reports both the raw series, as well as a
series adjusted in 2009-2013 for the increase in the quantity of Treasury debt outstanding
that occurred in those years as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009. The adjusted series equals the level of foreign holdings as a fraction of trend GDP
that would have occurred in 2009-2013 had Treasury debt outstanding as a fraction of trend
GDP been …xed at its 2008 level. For the unadjusted series, foreign holdings almost tripled
from 2001 to 2010, increasing from 13.5% of trend GDP in 2001 to 39.4% by June 2013.
But the adjusted series implies that foreign holdings were just 22.7% of trend GDP in June
2013, 16.7% lower than the unadjusted …gure. This suggests that an unwinding of foreign
holdings, at least relative to trend GDP, may have been underway by the end of our sample.
This paper is concerned with changes in capital ‡ows that result from changes in the net
foreign holdings of U.S. safe assets, which we de…ne to be U.S. Treasury and Agency debt.
Figure 2 shows that net foreign holdings of other securities as a fraction of U.S. Trend GDP
have hovered close to zero since 1994, even as net foreign holdings of safe securities have
soared. Thus all of the upward trend in net foreign holdings of U.S. securities since 1994
has been the result of an upward trend in net foreign holdings of U.S. safe assets. Indeed,
although not shown in the graph, all of the upward trend in the overall U.S. net debtor
position (which accounts for non-security assets such as Foreign Direct Investment) over the
last 15 years is attributable to foreign purchases of U.S. safe assets.7

Our model includes only two securities that could be traded: stocks and bonds. Thus, we calibrate our
international capital ‡ows to changes in ‡ows on total …nancial securities. Other assets in the U.S. balance of

The rise in net holdings of U.S. safe assets by foreigners over time has coincided with
downward trend in real interest rates. The real annual interest rate on the 10-year Treasury
bond fell from 3.87% at the start of 2000 to 2.04% by the end of 2005, while the 10-year
Treasury In‡ation Protected (TIPS) rate fell from 4.32% to 2.12% over this period. Real
rates fell further to all time lows during the economic contraction that followed. The real
10-year Treasury bond rate declined from 2.04% to -0.04% from 2006.12 to 2012.12, while
the TIPS rate declined from 2.25% to -0.76%.8
Foreign o¢ cial institutions have dominated these trends. In June 2010, according to
data from the Treasury International Capital Reporting System (TIC), FOIs held 75% of
all foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries, a likely under-estimate, since some prominent foreign
governments purchase U.S. securities through o¤shore centers and third-country intermediaries, purchases that would not be attributed to foreign o¢ cial entities by the TIC system
(Warnock and Warnock (2009)). FOI holdings account for a similarly large fraction of the
increase in foreign holdings of Treasuries over time, especially in the last 10 years: they
account for 81% of the increase in foreign ownership of U.S. Treasuries from March 2000 to
June 2010. Over the longer time frame shown in Figure 2 (December 1994 to June 2010),
FOI holdings account for 77% of the increase in foreign held Treasuries and 73% of the
increase in Agency debt.
O¢ cial ‡ows behave quite di¤erently from private ‡ows. Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan, and
Volosovych (2011) …nd that o¢ cial ‡ows are the main driver of uphill capital ‡ows and
global imbalances and, together with Aguiar and Amador (2011), they argue that o¢ cial
‡ows are not well described by two-country neoclassical models with private optimizing
agents (private ‡ows are, but they go downhill). Kohn (2002) emphasizes that government
entities have speci…c regulatory and reserve currency motives for holding U.S. Treasuries and
face both legal and political restrictions on the type of assets that can be held, forcing them
payments system include foreign direct investment, U.S. o¢ cial reserves, and other U.S. government reserves.
Net foreign holdings on these assets also display no discernable upward trend since 1994. See Favilukis, Kohn,
Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013) for a detailed discussion of recent trends in international capital
‡ows.

To compute the real interest rate, we use the 10-year constant maturity Treasury rate minus realized
in‡ation. We obtain similar results when we use the expectations of the average annual rate of CPI in‡ation
over the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, in percent per annum (sources: U.S.
Treasury, Survey of Professional Forecasters).

into safe securities. Historically (and in stark contrast to private investors), FOIs hold very
small fractions of their portfolios in risky securities of any kind,9 and Krishnamurthy and
Vissing-Jorgensen (2007) report that demand for U.S. Treasury securities by governmental
holders is, unlike private holders, extremely inelastic, implying that when these holders
receive funds to invest they buy U.S. Treasuries, regardless of their price.
These observations suggest that it is appropriate to model foreign safe asset holdings
as owned by governmental holders who inelastically place all of their funds in the domestic
riskless bond. This can be accomplished by taking the observed ‡ows as equilibrium outcomes, and calibrating the model’s changes in net capital ‡ows on safe assets to match those
observed in data. We then feed these changes into the bond market clearing condition that
determines the equilibrium interest rate on riskless bonds.10 We now discuss our speci…cation
for net capital ‡ows to U.S. safe assets.
Let BF;t denote the stochastic supply of foreign capital to the domestic bond market,
i.e., BF;t > 0 represents a net positive bond position by foreign holders (a net liability for
domestic households). Given the timing convention of the budget constraint (5) below, BF;t+1
is beginning of period t + 1 debt and therefore known at time t. A positive net foreign asset
in‡ow is identically equivalent to a trade de…cit (negative trade balance), which is re‡ected in
the aggregate resource constraint of the economy–see equation (9) below. Given a probability
law for stochastic foreign holdings, households form beliefs about their evolution.
Let Y t denote trend GDP. In the model, all aggregate variables grow deterministically
at rate g, thus trend output is normalized to exp (gt). In the data, we use the Hodrick
and Prescott (1997) (HP) …lter to compute the trend component of GDP. We assume that
households form beliefs according to a stochastic process for foreign holdings relative to trend

The model below assumes that domestic and foreign inputs are perfectly substitutable, so that adjustments to the capital account don’t e¤ect total factor productivity (TFP). If these inputs are modeled as
perfect substitutes but are in fact imperfect substitutes, then movements in the relative prices of these goods
can impact measured TFP, either because they alter the number of varieties used or because they alter the
quality mix of domestic and foreign inputs. Gopinath and Neiman (2011) study the Argentinean economy
and …nd that such trade adjustments deliver quantitatively important declines in manufacturing TFP. In this
paper we maintain the assumption that abstracting from heterogeneous inputs is a reasonable approximation
for the U.S. productive sector as a whole.

has been normalized to have standard deviation equal to unity. The stochastic

process (1) implies that external leverage relative to trend GDP reverts to a mean, b. Thus,
while some amount of the nation’s debt is expected to be re…nanced in perpetuity, amounts
above the mean (such as those represented in recent data) are expected to be paid back
rather than re…nanced.
This process is calibrated to historical data on foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury debt
(available from the Department of Treasury, U.S. Government). A grid for the state variable
bF;t is used in the numerical solution. Both the grid span and the parameters of the AR(1)
process for bF;t+1 (1) are calibrated from historical data on foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury
debt spanning the period 1984 to 2010. Estimation of the AR(1) process on these data
produces values for

b

= 0:95, b = 0:148, and

b

= 0:017. The Appendix provides additional

details on how this process is estimated from data.
An important feature of the process as written above is that the shocks

t+1

are exoge-

nous, unrelated to the other primitive aggregate shocks in the model economy, namely two
productivity shocks. Of course, foreign capital ‡ows in the model will still be contemporaneously correlated with aggregate quantities and prices, since ‡ows endogenously in‡uence
these variables in equilibrium. But there is no implication from the speci…cation (1) that
FOI holdings of the safe asset respond to the domestic economy.11
To investigate whether this speci…cation is reasonable, we run Granger causality regressions of log changes in bF;t+1 (“‡ows”) on lagged log changes in GDP and lagged log
change in two di¤erent measures of total factor productivity (TFP) from Fernald (2009).
Table 1 presents results for 4-quarter log changes in these variables. Thus, we regress ‡ows
ln (bF;t )

ln (bF;t 4 ) on a constant, two lags of itself, two lags of the log di¤erence in TFP,

and two lags of the log di¤erence in GDP.
The key observation from Table 1 is that foreign purchases of U.S. safe assets are essentially “explained” by lagged ‡ows, not by lagged GDP growth or lagged TFP growth.
11

Put di¤erently, a potential concern is that positive productivity shocks cause a trade de…cit and capital
in‡ow, which we would attribute to a capital in‡ow shock rather than a productivity shock.

9

Lagged GDP growth and lagged TFP growth are statistically and economically insigni…cant
explanatory variables. The fourth column shows that lagged GDP growth by itself explains
just 3.7% of the variation in the log change in ‡ows. This should be contrasted with the
result in column 1, which shows that adding lagged ‡ows allows the regression to explain
18% of the variation in log change in ‡ows. To form a basis for comparison, column 5 shows
that lagged GDP growth is a strong predictor of GDP growth itself, despite the …nding that
these lags explain virtually none of the movement in foreign purchases of U.S. safe assets.
We conclude that modeling changes in FOI purchases of safe assets as independent of the
domestic economy is a reasonable …rst approximation. Note that this evidence and modeling
approach does not imply or presume that the entire current account is exogenous. It applies
only to ‡ows on safe assets, which are dominated by FOI purchases. What the evidence
above suggests is that this component is plausibly exogenous to the domestic economy. It is
this component that we study here.

The Model

This section describes the model economy with two productive sectors. Time is discrete
and each period t corresponds to a year. The economy grows deterministically at rate g.
The exogenous aggregate shocks of the model include a stationary shock to foreign capital
relative to trend GDP, and stationary technology shocks Zk;t , one to each of the two sectors
indexed by k, that have both a deterministic component and stochastic component, i.e.,
Zk;t = exp (gt) zk;t , where zk;t is a stationary technology shock. The variable exp (gt) is trend
output, interchangeably denoted Y t

exp (gt).

Firms

The production side of the economy consists of two sectors, one producing a non-housing
consumption good, and the other producing a housing good. We refer to the …rst as the
“consumption sector”and the second as the “housing sector.”

We assume that, each period, the government makes available a …xed supply L of
land/permits for residential construction by renting them at the competitive rental rate
equal to the marginal product of Lt . As described below, the proceeds from land/permits
along with lump sum taxes are used to …nance a (nonstochastic) amount of government
borrowing in the risk-free bond market. When a house is sold, the government issues a
transferable lease for the land/permits in perpetuity at no charge to the homeowner. Thus,
the buyer of the home operates as owner even though, by eminent domain, the government
retains the legal right to the land/permits.

3.2

Government Borrowing

We allow foreign in‡ows to …nance government borrowing, as well as private borrowing. By
doing so, high borrowing by current generations can in‡uence unborn generations through
future taxes and transfers. To keep the model tractable, we introduce non-stochastic government debt issuance in the risk-free bond market as follows. Let BtG be the government’s
demand for bonds, which we set to be a …xed fraction of trend GDP BtG = bG Y t . In this
calibration, BtG is negative since the government supplies bonds, hence is a net borrower.
The parameter bG < 0 is set to equal the (negative of) the observed ratio of government
debt to trend GDP over the period 1984-2008.
At time t + 1 the government raises funds by issuing new debt (negative bond demand)

Lump sum taxes equal the di¤erence between the government’s interest payments and land
revenue. This insures that the interest payments are funded. We assume that Tt is distributed
lump-sum across the population and denote the proportion of government lump sum transfers
paid to individual i as Tti .

3.3

Individuals

The economy is populated by A overlapping generations of individuals, indexed by a =
1; :::; A; with a continuum of individuals born each period. Individuals live through two
stages of life, a working stage and a retirement stage. Adult age begins at age 21, so a equals
this e¤ective age minus 20. Agents live for a maximum of A = 80 (100 years). Workers
live from age 21 (a = 1) to 65 (a = 45) and then retire. Retired workers die with an agedependent probability calibrated from life expectancy data. The probability that an agent
13

is alive at age a + 1 conditional on being alive at age a is denoted

a+1ja .

Individuals have an intraperiod utility function given by

aversion,

is the relative weight on non-housing consumption in utility. Implicit in this

speci…cation is the assumption that the service ‡ow from houses is proportional to the stock
Ha;t .
Individuals are heterogeneous in their labor productivity. To denote this heterogeneity, we
index individuals i. Before retirement households supply labor inelastically. The stochastic
process for individual income for workers is the product of Wt , the aggregate wage per unit of
productivity, and Lia;t , the individual’s labor endowment (hours times an individual-speci…c
productivity factor). Labor productivity is speci…ed by a deterministic age-speci…c pro…le,
Ga , and an individual shock Zti :
Lia;t = Ga Zti

where Ga is a deterministic function of age capturing a hump-shaped pro…le in life-cycle
earnings and

i

is a stochastic i.i.d. shock to individual earnings. To capture countercyclical

variation in idiosyncratic risk of the type documented by Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron
(2004), we use a two-state speci…cation for the variance of idiosyncratic earnings shocks:

This speci…cation implies that the variance of idiosyncratic labor earnings is higher in “recessions” (ZC;t

E (ZC;t )) than in “expansions” (ZC;t

E (ZC;t )). The former is denoted

with an “R”subscript, the latter with an “E”subscript. Labor earnings are taxed at rate
in order to …nance social security retirement income. Upon death, any remaining net worth

14

of an individual is transferred to a newborn who replaces her, via an accidental bequest.13
Other than these accidental bequests, agents are not endowed with any risky assets or bonds
at birth.
Financial market trade is limited to a one-period riskless bond and to risky capital, where
the latter is restricted to be a mutual fund of equity in the housing and consumption sectors.
The gross bond return is denoted Rf;t =

chooses to change housing consumption pays a transaction cost FH;t

One component of the transactions cost in illiquid housing is the cost directly associated
with housing …nance, speci…cally borrowing costs. We use direct evidence to calibrate a

The collateral constraint (Equation 6 below) implies that net worth is non-negative so that accidental
bequests are non-negative. If household i dies in period t then his net worth at death, left accidentally, is
equivalent to the amount inherited by the newborn who replaces the dead individual. We allow the newborn
to make an optimal portfolio choice over risky assets, bonds, and housing for how the bequeathed wealth is
allocated in the …rst period of life. Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) study a model in
which, in addition to these accidental bequests, some small fraction of households leave intentional bequests,
driven by a bequest motive in their value functions.

as described in the appendix. We denote this law of motion :

This completes the description of the model economy. We now turn to the de…nition of
equilibrium.

3.4

price, and land price) given by time-invariant functions qt = q ( t ; Zt ), Wt = W ( t ; Zt ) ;

The aggregate resource constraint for the economy must take into account the housing and

non-housing output equals non-housing consumption (inclusive of total …nancial transactions

To solve the model, it is necessary to approximate the in…nite dimensional object

with a

…nite dimensional object. The appendix explains the solution procedure and how we specify a
…nite dimensional vector to represent the law of motion for : The resulting approximation,
or “bounded rationality” equilibrium has been used extensively in the literature to solve
incomplete markets models (see the appendix for further discussion).

3.5

Welfare Measure

To quantify the welfare e¤ects of di¤erent foreign holdings regimes, we use a consumption
equivalent variation measure. To explain this measure, it is necessary to introduce some
additional notation. Let Ht without an i subscript denote aggregate housing wealth, i.e.,
R
i
Ht
Ha;t
d , and analogously for other individual variables. To study a growing economy,
S

it will be convenient to normalize trending variables by trend output and denote their deterministically detrended values in lower case, e.g., zc;t

Zc;t exp ( gt), hit

Hti exp ( gt),

etc. The solved policy functions and state variables are expressed in terms of normalized
variables.
14

Note that (9) simply results from aggregating the budget constraints across all households, imposing all
market clearing conditions, and using the de…nitions of dividends as equal to …rm revenue minus costs.

18

As explained in the appendix, the bounded rationality equilibrium is computed by approximating the in…nite dimensional object (Zt ;

t)

with a …nite dimensional vector of aggre-

gate state variables given next. Let the subset of aggregate state variables excluding foreign
bonds be approximated by
(zC;t ; zH;t ;

We quantify the welfare consequences of di¤erent foreign capital states by computing
the increment to lifetime utility (the household value function) in units of the composite
(housing plus nonhousing) consumption good, of being in a high versus low state of foreign
capital holdings relative to trend GDP. We call this a consumption “equivalent variation”
(EV) measure. For example, we can compute the equivalent variation measure for individual
i of age a that would result from transitioning into a di¤erent foreign capital state at t + 1
by an increment

, compared to remaining in a particular foreign capital state bF;t+1 = bF;t :

The equivalent variation measure tells us how much this individual’s lifetime composite
consumption must be increased so that her utility from remaining in a particular foreign
capital state bF;t equals that from transitioning to bF;t +

. (We multiply the units by 100

so as to express them in percent.) Positive numbers therefore re‡ect a welfare gain from
transitioning, whereas negative numbers re‡ect a welfare loss.
We use a similar criterion to compute an ex-ante welfare measure under the “veil of
ignorance.”That is, we compute the welfare implications of a change in foreign holdings for
an agent about to be born (age = 0) with the average idiosyncratic productivity, Zti = 1;
19

i

whose …nancial wealth, W0;t
; and housing wealth, H0;t
; are optimally chosen prior to entering

the model based on the accidental bequest inherited from the dead. This is computed using
that agent’s value function at the start of life, which incorporates the agent’s expectation of
lifetime utility over all possible aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks in the future, i.e.,

Finally, we compare the welfare consequences for more aggregated demographic groups
in a similar manner, averaging EV across such groups.

Model Calibration

The numerical calibration of the model’s parameters are reported in Table 2. A detailed
explanation of this calibration, including individual and aggregate productivity shocks, is
given in the Appendix. The technology shocks ZC and ZH are assumed to follow two-state
independent Markov chains. Because most of the parameter calibrations are either standard
or follow from previous papers, we provide the discussion over these values in the Appendix.

Benchmark Results

This section presents the model’s main implications. Unless otherwise noted, these implications are based on long simulations of the model using the solved optimal policy functions
and evolution equations for the state variables. Before turning to the welfare implications of

In practice, this is accomplished by locating all points within a close radius of a particular value.

20

changes in foreign holdings, we present the model’s predictions for a set of benchmark business cycle and asset pricing statistics, and we study how these statistics depend on foreign
capital ‡ows into U.S. safe assets.
Table 3 presents benchmark results for HP-detrended aggregate quantities. We report
statistics for total output, GDP

Y = YC +pH YH +CH , non-housing consumption (inclusive

of expenditures on …nancial services), equal to Ct + Ft , housing consumption CH;t , de…ned as
price per unit of housing services times quantity of housing or CH;t

Rt Ht , total (housing

and non-housing) consumption CT;t = Ct + Ft + CH;t , non-housing investment (inclusive
of adjustment costs) It = (IC;t +

C

( ) KC;t ) + (IH;t +

H

( ) KH;t ), residential investment,

H
pH
t YH;t , and total investment IT;t = It + pt YH;t .

The standard deviation of total aggregate consumption divided by the standard deviation
of GDP is 0.63 in the model, identical to the 0.63 value found in the data. In addition, the
level of GDP volatility in the model is close to that in the data. The model produces a
plausible amount of aggregate consumption volatility. Total investment is more volatile
than output, both in the model and in the data, and the model produces about the right
amount of relative volatility: the ratio of the standard deviation of total investment to that
of GDP is 3.57 in the model compared to 2.95 in the data. The model does a good job of
matching the relative volatility of residential investment to output: in the data the ratio of
these volatilities is 4.65, while it is 5.14 in the model. Finally, both in the model and the
data, residential investment is less correlated with output than is consumption and total
investment. But the model somewhat understates the share of consumption in GDP.
To get a sense of the how aggregate business cycle statistics are a¤ected by the quantities
of foreign holdings of domestic assets, as well as by a capital in‡ow (out‡ow), Table 4 presents
the mean and standard deviation of the (detrended) aggregate variables, conditional on the
stock of foreign holdings as of last period, bF;t (external leverage), as well as on the change
(‡ow) in foreign holdings this period,

bF;t+1 . The statistics are reported conditional on

being in the top or bottom half of the sample in terms of these variables, distinguished as
high values, “H” or low values, “L.” In computing these statistics, we average out over the
other aggregate shocks in the economy (the productivity shocks) using long simulations,
thereby isolating the e¤ect of external leverage on the economy.
21

A capital in‡ow, which represents a negative trade balance or a current account de…cit,
…nances domestic spending and therefore acts like a positive economic shock. Table 4 shows
that a high capital in‡ow stimulates investment and consumption: the means of these variables are higher when capital in‡ows are high than when in‡ows are low. Total investment
is 15% higher (mean of 0.7 versus 0.61) in high in‡ow states than in low in‡ow states, while
residential investment is 25% higher. This leads GDP to be about 1% higher. A high capital
in‡ow also makes consumption and investment less volatile, relative to low capital in‡ow
states. Investment volatility falls because an in‡ow leads to a higher level of investment.
With convex adjustment costs, the volatility of investment is reduced because the cost of
any given change in investment is higher when the level of investment is high.
A high stock of external leverage, bF;t , has a smaller impact on consumption and investment. This happens because, although some of the debt relative to trend GDP is expected
to be rolled over inde…nitely, amounts above average are not. Thus, the stimulatory a¤ect
of past in‡ows is dampened by the expectation that some of the debt must eventually be
repaid, as capital ‡ows relative to GDP slowly mean-revert.
Table 5 shows the sensitivity of the log di¤erence in aggregate variables to both the level
of external holdings last period, bF;t , and the capital ‡ow
on these variables. A capital in‡ow

bF;t , from a multivariate regression

bF;t+1 stimulates higher economic growth (consumption,

investment and GDP), and higher growth in the capital stocks at the beginning of next period
(housing and physical capital). The marginal e¤ect of a high capital in‡ow also raises the
real wage (row 10), since the in‡ux of foreign funds stimulates growth in the capital stock
and, along with it, the value of the relatively scarce factor (labor). Controlling for the
stimulatory impact of a higher capital in‡ow, however, a high level of external debt has a
small contractionary e¤ect on spending, since above mean levels of debt relative to trend
GDP must eventually be repaid. The e¤ects of these changes in the stock of external debt
on investment are too small to have a discernible in‡uence on the slow-moving physical and
housing capital stocks.
Table 6 reports the model’s implications for asset pricing moments. The table reports
unconditional moments in the “all” column, as well as moments conditional on either the
stock of foreign holdings last period, bF;t , or on the ‡ow this period,
22

bF;t+1 , being above or

below average. The Sharpe ratio for each asset, denoted SR [ ] ; is de…ned to be the mean of
the return on the asset in excess of the risk-free rate, divided by the standard deviation of
this excess return.
The benchmark model comes close to matching the historical mean return for the risk-free
rate but somewhat overstates the volatility of the risk-free rate. The model produces a sizable
equity return of 6.7% per annum, an annual equity premium of 6.1%, and annual Sharpe
ratio of 0.67. Two factors related to the cyclicality of the cross-sectional distribution of
consumption contribute to the model’s high average risk premium and Sharpe ratio. First,
idiosyncratic income risk is countercyclical. Second, house prices and therefore collateral
values are procyclical, making borrowing constraints countercyclical. These factors mean
that insurance/risk-sharing opportunities are reduced precisely when households need them
most (in recessions). The model produces about the right mean return for the aggregate
house price index. The mean housing return is 8.06% on an annual basis, with Sharpe ratio
equal to 1.33, comparable to U.S. data for aggregate house price indexes.16
One shortcoming of the present setup is that the volatility of the equity return is about
60% of what it is in post-war data, re‡ecting a well known trade-o¤ in production-based
models with adjustment costs between matching the volatility of investment and the volatility
of equity returns. One potential resolution is to increase adjustment costs while at the same
time introducing additional shocks to o¤set the reduction in the volatility of investment, or
investment-speci…c technology shocks. We do not pursue these possibilities here in order
to keep the complexity of the model to a minimum and the numerical solution procedure
manageable.
The right-most four columns of Table 6 show asset pricing moments conditional on the
amount of external leverage, bF;t , or conditional on high or low capital in‡ows,

bF;t+1 . Both

a high level of external leverage and a high capital in‡ow lead to a sharp decline in the riskless
interest rate and in the expected return on equity. At the same time, however, an in‡ow
leads to an increase in the equity risk premium and Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio on equity
16

The housing Sharpe ratio in the model pertains to an aggregate house index return. Individual houses
are subject to signi…cant idiosyncratic risk that is averaged out in the aggregate index and would have much
lower Sharpe ratios. See the appendix for additional discussion.

23

is 13% higher in high capital in‡ow states than in low capital in‡ow states. Risk premia
rise because the in‡ow reduces the e¤ective supply of the safe asset, forcing domestic savers
to hold more of their funds in the form of risky securities. Thus, although total expected
returns (discount rates) fall in response to a capital in‡ow, the risk-premium component of
the discount rate rises.
Results are similar for the housing asset. A high level of external leverage leads to a
higher housing risk premium, as does an in‡ow. The rise in risk premia in turn partially
(but not fully) o¤sets the stimulatory impact of a lower riskless interest rate on home prices,
partly explaining why there is only a modest increase in the price-rent ratio in response to a
high level of external leverage (row 13). (The response of aggregate homes to a foreign in‡ow
is also limited by the equilibrium increase in residential investment, as discussed below.)
In contrast to the modest impact a foreign capital in‡ow has on the price-rent ratio, the
stock price-dividend ratio (V =D) responds sharply to a capital in‡ow and is 50% higher than
average, conditional on a capital in‡ow. This occurs because a capital in‡ow is met with a
signi…cant increase in expected dividend growth that is not present for expected rent growth.
Indeed, positive economic shocks, which stimulate residential investment, are associated with
an expectation of lower, rather than higher, future rental growth, an e¤ect that, but for the
o¤setting decline in discount rates, would reduce the price-rent ratio.17 Taken together, these
elements of the model imply that a reserve-driven capital in‡ow of the type that occurred
in the last 15 years can have, at most, a limited impact on home prices.18
Table 6 (columns 4 and 5) also shows that a high level of external leverage, bF;t , raises
both the risk premium on equity and housing and the volatility of these assets, as domestic
households on the whole are now in a more levered portfolio position.19
17
Rents are inversely related to the housing stock because the implicit rental price for housing services
is positively related the marginal utility of housing services relative to the marginal utility of non-housing
services. By contrast, expected future pro…ts of the productive sector are positively related to an expansion
of the physical capital stock because the resulting increase in the marginal product of labor more than o¤sets
the marginal cost of new investment.
18
It follows that other factors must be primarily responsible for the large boom-bust cycle in home prices
that occurred from 2000-2010. Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) argue that plausibly
calibrated changes in collateral requirements and housing transactions cost can account for the run-up and
subsequent decline in U.S. aggregate house price-rent ratios.
19
This outcome is the same as that in Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009), who study a two-asset (equity
and risk-free rate) representative agent exchange economy in which foreign demand for the safe asset is

24

Finally, we investigate how international capital ‡ows a¤ect the growth rates of asset
values, returning to the last two rows of Table 5. A capital in‡ow stimulates growth in
the aggregate value of the risky mutual fund as well as in housing wealth, pH
t Ht+1 . But
conditional on the in‡ow, the level of external …nance depresses asset values as the …nancing
burden of higher external debt takes its toll on domestic spending and ultimately on asset
valuations.
The relationship between external leverage and risk premia in the model is worthy of
emphasis. In equilibrium, both a capital in‡ow and a high level of external leverage bF;t
raise risk premia on housing and equity, rather than lower them. This runs contrary to the
argument, made by some, that the free ‡ow of capital across borders should be associated
with a reduction in risk premia (e.g., Geithner (2007)). Here, foreign purchases of the safe
asset make both domestic equity and domestic housing assets more risky, both because a
higher level of external leverage forces domestic residents as a whole to take a leveraged
position in the risky assets, and because the quantity of systematic risk per unit volatility
borne by domestic savers rises.

Welfare Implications

We now turn to the welfare e¤ects of international capital ‡ows into the risk-free asset.
Figure 3 shows the EV measure integrated out across all values of bF;t (dashed lines), as
well as conditional on the economy residing in particular quintiles of bF;t (solid lines). The
consequences of a capital in‡ow are shown in the left panel and a capital out‡ow in the right
panel.
Figure 3 shows that the welfare implications of a capital in‡ow or out‡ow are nonperfectly correlated with (but less volatile than), domestic consumption. But unlike here, in their model a
capital in‡ow (an increase in external leverage) lowers equity risk premia. The reasons for this di¤erence are
three-fold. First, capital ‡ows in Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009) are assumed to be more stable than
domestic cash ‡ows, which lowers risk premia by stabilizing the economy. Here, capital ‡ows are independent
of the aggregate state and have innovations that are about as volatile as GDP. Second, unlike Caballero and
Krishnamurthy (2009), international capital ‡ows are not perfectly correlated with domestic cash ‡ows; they
therefore add systematic risk to the economy, uncorrelated with the aggregate risk already there. Third,
Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009) solve their model in continuous time, so that the instantaneous e¤ect
of a capital in‡ow has a negligible e¤ect on leverage. By contrast, in the discrete time setting here, capital
in‡ows have an immediate e¤ect on external leverage.

25

monotone in age, and that the e¤ects are potentially sizable. An increase in foreign holdings
(

> 0) bene…ts the young (age 35 or less), while a decrease is costly. The young bene…t

from a capital in‡ow due to lower interest rates, which reduce the costs of home ownership
and of borrowing in anticipation of higher expected future income attributable to the humpshaped life-cycle pro…le in earnings. An in‡ow stimulates the real wage (Table 5), which also
bene…ts the young, a group with many years of working life ahead. At the average level of
external leverage, bF;t , the youngest households require about 0.20% more lifetime consumption to make them as well o¤ as they would be from transitioning to a state where external
leverage is higher for one year by the typical annual increment

. This value is slightly

lower than when external leverage is at the lowest quintiles of the distribution. Conversely,
a capital out‡ow hurts the young. The average EV measure associated with a decline in
foreign holdings over all quintiles is -0.20% for the youngest households.
The welfare consequences are reversed for middle-aged households (age 45 to 72), who
are signi…cantly hurt by a capital in‡ow when the level of external leverage is su¢ ciently
low. This occurs despite the fact that, like the young, many middle-aged households of
working age still bene…t from higher wages. The reason is that they are crowded out of
the safe bond market and exposed to greater systematic risk in equity markets. Although
they are partially compensated for this in equilibrium by higher risk-premia, they still su¤er
from lower expected rates of return on all assets, including the riskless bond, equity, and
housing. The net e¤ect is that middle-aged savers experience a welfare loss from an in‡ow
and, conversely, a welfare gain from a capital out‡ow.
Two points about this result bear noting. First, the absolute value of the EV measure is
about the same as that for the youngest households, but of the opposite sign, indicating the
middle-aged households bene…t from an out‡ow by about as much as the youngest households
are hurt. But this is not true for an increase in foreign holdings (

> 0): the EV welfare

measure for 65 year-old households in the lowest foreign holdings quintile is -0.5%, twice as
large in absolute value as the gain for young households in that quintile. Second, the EV
measure for sixty …ve year-olds associated with a decrease in foreign holdings is negative,
conditional on being in the highest foreign leverage quintile, implying that middle-aged
households bene…t from an out‡ow only when the level of external leverage is su¢ ciently
26

low.
Results not reported show that this latter result can be explained by the behavior of
expected asset returns, which respond more to a capital ‡ow when the level of external
leverage is low compared to when it is high. Thus, for example, an out‡ow causes a larger
increase in expected returns when the level of external leverage is low compared to when
it is high. Higher expected returns are bene…cial for middle-aged savers, but they can only
improve overall welfare if they rise by enough to o¤set the negative welfare consequences
from both lower wages and lower asset values that also accompany an out‡ow.
We now consider the welfare consequences for older households of an increase in foreign
holdings. The left panel of Figure 3 shows that older retired individuals bene…t signi…cantly
by an increase in foreign ownership of the safe asset. They gain from the increase in the value
of their assets when there is an in‡ow. Because they are dissaving at the end of life, they are
less hurt than are middle-aged savers by a decline in expected returns. And because retirees
earn a pension that is in large part determined by their earnings in the last period of working
life, they are less exposed to systematic risk than are individuals of working age, whose labor
earnings vary not only with the current aggregate state but also with the countercyclical
‡uctuation in the variance of idiosyncratic earnings surprises–see (4).20 Taken together,
these factors imply that older households experience a signi…cant net gain from even modest
increases in asset values that accompany a capital in‡ow. The right panel of Figure 3 shows
that, from the highest external leverage quintile, the oldest individuals would be willing to
give up 1.4% of lifetime consumption in order to avoid transitioning to a state where external
leverage is lower for one year by a typical annual increment. This e¤ect could be several
times larger for a greater-than-typical decline, and many times larger for a series of annual
declines in succession or over the remainder of the household’s lifetime.
Figure 4 decomposes the welfare costs of a capital out‡ow by age, income and wealth.
Young individuals who are high-income and especially those who are wealthy su¤er less from
a capital out‡ow than low-income or poor households because they are better equipped to
20

Pension (Social Security) income is not entirely insulated from aggregate risk, since the pay-as-you-go
system depends on tax revenue, which in turn depends on the current wage. But it is still far less sensitive
to the current aggregate state than is labor income.

27

self-insure against idiosyncratic and aggregate risks without the bene…t of easier borrowing
terms that foreign capital provides. By contrast, high net worth retirees su¤er more than
low net worth retirees, because they have the most to lose from an out‡ow, namely a decline
in the value of their assets. A similar pattern occurs when comparing high versus low income
retirees because income and net worth are positively correlated in the model.
As a …nal welfare computation, we calculate the costs of a capital out‡ow under the
“veil of ignorance”using newborn equivalent variation measure EVN B in (11). The measure
compares the value function of a newborn, born into the …fth quintile of today’s foreign
holdings, bF;t+1 = b5;t+1 ; with the value function of a newborn born into each of the other
quintiles, bF;t+1 = b1;t+1 ; b2;t+1 ;...; b4;t+1 . Since (11) depends on last period’s bond holdings
bF;t , we integrate EVN B out against the distribution of previous-period bond holdings bF;t .
The measure thus compares the lifetime utility functions of two newborns starting working
life with di¤erent levels of external leverage bF;t+1 but with the same initial idiosyncratic
productivity draw, equal to the average across agents and over time value of Zti = 1. The
newborn computation depends on the initial level of initial wealth bequeathed to the newborn. We therefore compute this measure at the median, 25th and 75th percentiles of the
newborn wealth distribution. The measure summarizes the expected welfare e¤ects of an increase in external leverage, over the life cycle, as experienced by a newborn whose stochastic
path of future earnings and foreign capital ‡ows is unknown.
Figure 5 shows that newborns born into high foreign capital states are better o¤ than
those born into low capital states as long as they start life with wealth in the 25th or
50th percentile of the newborn wealth distribution. The poorest newborns who come into
a world where foreign holdings are in their highest quintile would be willing to give up
2.7% of lifetime consumption to avoid being born into a world where the foreign holdings
distribution is in their the lowest quintile. The cumulative e¤ects over the life-cycle can be
non-trivial, especially when contemplating a large capital ‡ow. By contrast, the wealthiest
newborns actually bene…t slightly from an out‡ow. From Figure 4 we see that the wealthiest
are not hurt by an out‡ow until old age, and they are slightly helped during middle age.
But the negative consequences of an out‡ow during old age are heavily discounted from the
perspective of a newborn, since the average agent in the model lives to age 80 (a lifespan
28

of 60 years) and the debt/GDP ratio is stationary and expected to mean revert over long
horizons.

Conclusion

The last two decades have been marked by a steady rise in international ownership of U.S.
assets considered to be safe stores-of-value. Some have argued that these trends are optimal
or benign, and/or that countries like the United States ultimately bene…t from easier borrowing terms (e.g., Dooley, Folkerts-Landau, and Garber (2005), Cooper (2007), Mendoza,
Quadrini, and Rios-Rull (2009), Caballero, Fahri, and Gourinchas (2008a)). Others (sometimes at the same time) have warned of the hazards of ever-increasing external leverage, and
of the greater systematic risk that accompanies it (Caballero, Fahri, and Gourinchas (2008a),
Caballero, Fahri, and Gourinchas (2008b), Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2009), Fahri, Gourinchas,
and Rey (2011)). Missing from this analysis are equilibrium models of aggregate and idiosyncratic risks, plausible …nancial markets, and household heterogeneity with which to study
the welfare consequences of these global capital ‡ows.
In this paper, we turn to such an equilibrium theory in order to better our understanding
of the distributional consequences of this brand of international capital ‡ow. We …nd that
these ‡ows confer on U.S. households both costs and bene…ts, both greater risk and greater
opportunities to insure against risk, and that they do so concurrently. The relevant question
is, which households are privy to the bene…ts and which are subject to the costs?
The model we study implies that foreign governmental demand for U.S. safe assets does
lead to easier borrowing terms in the U.S., which bene…ts young households who are in
a borrowing stage of the life-cycle, unless they are relatively wealthy and less reliant on
borrowed funds. It also especially bene…ts the wealthy old, both because they gain from the
rise in asset values that accompanies a capital in‡ow, and because they have the least to
lose from lower expected rates of return and from the greater exposure of domestic saving to
systematic risk. On the other hand, such ‡ows are potentially quite costly for the middleaged, who …nd their retirement savings earning lower expected rates of return on portfolios
increasingly tilted towards assets with greater systematic risk. This phenomenon is re‡ected
29

in a sharp rise in the equilibrium risk premium on equity and housing assets, and in a decline
in the lifetime utility of households saving for retirement. Our computations imply that the
intergenerational tradeo¤s in welfare can be sizable. For an individual just beginning working
life, the consequences crucially depend on how much wealth she begins life with: a large sello¤ by foreign governments of their holdings of U.S. safe assets would be expected (under the
veil of ignorance) to be fairly costly for the poorest newborns but slightly bene…cial for the
richest.
It is commonly believed that a large in‡ux of international capital (on the order of magnitude experienced in the U.S. over the last 15 years) played an important role in U.S. home
price appreciation. If so, one might have expected middle-aged savers who own homes to
gain, rather than lose, from a capital in‡ow. As the model shows, this reasoning ignores the
general equilibrium response of both residential investment and risk-premia that accompany
a capital in‡ow. A capital in‡ow acts like a positive economic shock, provoking a rise in
residential investment and reducing the expected growth rate of the dividend that housing
pays. At the same time, in‡ows into the safe asset cause an increase in the housing risk
premium, implying that discount rates fall less than the decline in the risk-free rate alone.
Both of these factors work to o¤set the stimulatory impact of a capital in‡ow-driven decline
in interest rates on home prices, thereby limiting this potential source of welfare gains to
middle-aged homeowners. Of course, these same factors limit house price appreciation for
all homeowners, including older homeowners who ultimately bene…t from the capital in‡ow.
The di¤erence is that older households don’t bear as much systematic risk in their retirement earnings as workers do in their labor earnings, and they su¤er far less than those still
accumulating wealth for retirement from lower expected rates of return.

Table 1: Granger Causality
The table reports results from Granger Causality regressions of changes in the U.S. net liability position, relative to trend GDP (”flows”),
on either GDP growth, or total factor productivity growth, or growth in the real exchange rate. The inverted Granger Causality
regressions for GDP/TFP/exchange rate growth on flows are also reported. The regression uses overlapping quarterly observations for
a sample that runs from 1984.IV until 2013.II (107 quarterly observations after adjusting the endpoints). The first column reports the
point estimates from a regressions of capital inflows into safe U.S. assets (“flows”), measured as log(bF,t ) − log(bF,t−4 ), on a constant,
its own lag log(bF,t−4 ) − log(bF,t−8 ), and lagged log real gross domestic product (GDP) growth log(Yt−4 ) − log(YF,t−8 ). The number
in brackets are Newey-West (HAC) adjusted t-statistics with 4 lags. The last row reports the adjusted R2 , in percentage points. The
second column replaces 4-quarter log changes in GDP by 4-quarter log changes in total factor productivity (TFP), while the third
column replaces it by 4-quarter log changes in variable capacity-adjusted total factor productivity (TFPU). Both TFP series are from
Fernald and Natsuki (2012). Columns 5 to 8 report results for regressions with the same right-hand side variables but GDP growth,
TFP changes, and TFPU changes on the left-hand side instead of capital inflows.

Table 2: Real Business Cycle Moments
Panel A denotes business cycle statistics in annual post-war U.S. data (1953-2012). The data combine information from NIPA Tables
1.1.5, 2.1, and 2.3.5. Output (Y = YC +pH YH +CH ) is gross domestic product minus net exports minus government expenditures. Total
consumption (CT ) is total private sector consumption (housing and non-housing). Housing consumption (CH = R ∗ H) is consumption
of housing services. Non-housing consumption (C) is total private sector consumption minus housing services. Housing investment
(pH YH ) is residential investment. Non-housing investment (I) is the sum of private sector non-residential structures, equipment and
software, and changes in inventory. Total investment is denoted IT (residential and non-housing). For each series in the data, we first
deflate by the disposable personal income deflator. We then construct the trend with a Hodrick-Prescott (1980) filter with parameter
λ = 100. Finally, we construct detrended data as the log difference between the raw data and the HP trend, multiplied by 100. The
standard deviation (first column) and correlation with GDP (second column) are based on these detrended series. The share of GDP
(third column) is based on the raw data. Panel B denotes the same statistics for the benchmark model.

Table 3: Quantities by Foreign Holdings
The table reports the first and second moments of real quantities by level of and changes in foreign holdings in the model. The quantity
variables are as defined in Table 2. Panel A reports means of the quantity variables (raw, detrended data), whereas Panel B reports
standard deviations (HP filtered data). In each panel, the “all” column reports the unconditional moment from a long simulation. The
column “high BF,t ” (“low BF,t ” ) reports the conditional moment of the dated-t variable, conditional on the foreign holdings level
bF,t , which was chosen at time t − 1, being in the highest (lowest) 1/2 of observations on the level of foreign holdings in the same long
simulation. The column “high ∆BF ” (“low ∆BF ” ) reports the conditional moment of the dated-t variable, conditional on the foreign
holdings change ∆bF = bF,t+1 − bF,t , which is known at time t, being in the highest (lowest) 1/2 of observations on the change in
foreign holdings in the same long simulation.

Table 4: Sensitivity to Changes in Foreign Holdings
The second and third rows of each panel report the slope coefficients βF,t and β∆bF of a multiple regression of the log change in a
variable between t+1 and t on a constant, the foreign holdings level bF,t (chosen in period t-1), and the foreign holdings flow between t
and t+1 ∆bF,t+1 :
log Xt+1 − log Xt = α + βF bF,t + β∆bF ∆bF,t+1 + ǫt .
The constant in the regression is omitted. The columns in Panel A refer to the same real variables defined in Table 2 (not HP detrended). The left-hand side variables corresponding to the results reported in Panel B are the growth rate in the beginning-of-period
capital (log Kt+2 − log Kt+1 ) and housing stock (log Ht+2 − log Ht+1 ), respectively, the aggregate wage, the aggregate house value, and
the aggregate stock market (mutual fund) capitalization.

Table 5: Asset Pricing Moments
The second column (data 1) reports the observed asset pricing moments, listed in the first column, in annual 1953-2012 data. The
equity return RS is the value-weighted CRSP stock market return minus the realized inflation rate over the course of the year. The
risk-free rate is measured as the nominal yield on a one-year government bond from the CRSP Fama-Bliss data set in the last month
of the preceding year minus the realized inflation rate over the course of the year. The price deflator is the same as in Table 2. The
housing return RH in data1 is the aggregate value of residential real estate wealth in the fourth quarter of the year from the Flow of
Funds plus the consumption of housing services summed over the four quarters of the year from NIPA divided by the value of residential
real estate in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. We subtract inflation to express the return in real terms and population growth
in order to correct for the growth in housing quantities due to population growth. The third column reports moments for the annual
1976-2012 sample. The housing return in data 2 uses the seasonally adjusted repeat-sale national house price index from Core Logic
and the seasonally-adjusted rental price index for shelter from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It assumes a price-rent ratio in 1975
equal to the one in data 1. We then use the quarterly price and rent indices to construct quarterly returns and price-rent ratios over the
1976-2012 period. We construct annual returns by compounding the quarterly returns during the year. We subtract realized inflation
from realized housing returns to form real housing returns. The stock return and risk-free rate in data 2 are the same as in data 1, but
measured over the shorter sample. The fourth column reports the unconditional asset pricing moments from a long simulation of the
model. The fifth (sixth) column reports the same time-t moments, but conditional on being in the highest 1/2 (lowest 1/2) of foreign
holdings levels bF,t , chosen at t-1. The seventh (eight) column reports the same time-t moments, but conditional on being in the highest
1/2 (lowest 1/2) of foreign holdings changes ∆bF,t between t-1 and t. For example, the last column, seventh row reports the equity risk
premium (the time-t expectation of the excess return between t and t+1), conditional on having experienced a foreign outflow between
t-1 and t. The first and second rows reports first and second moments of the one-period risk-free rate. The third and fourth (fifth and
sixth) rows report first and second moments of the unlevered (levered) physical capital return (i.e., stock market return). The seventh
row reports the average excess return, i.e., in excess of the riskfree rate. The eight row reports the Sharpe ratio, defined as the average
excess return divided by the standard deviation of the excess return. Rows nine through twelve report the analogous return moments
for the aggregate housing market. For columns five through 8, row thirteen (fourteen) reports the change in the house price-rent ratio
(stock market price-dividend ratio), measured as the percentage change relative to the “all” periods sample in column 4.

Appendix: For Online Publication
This …le is the online appendix to “Foreign Ownership of U.S. Safe Assets: Good or Bad?”This
appendix de…nes the model’s stochastic discount factor, spells out all equilibrium conditions,
de…nes equity and housing returns, describes how we calibrate the stochastic shock processes
in the model, as well as how we calibrate all other parameters. The last section details our
numerical solution strategy.

Stochastic Discount Factor
The stochastic discount factor (SDF),

t+1
t

, appears in the dynamic value maximization

problem (2) and (3) undertaken by each representative …rm. We assume that the representative …rm discounts future pro…ts using a weighted average of the individual shareholders’
MRS in non-housing consumption,

i
@U=@Ca+1;t+1
,
i
@U=@Ca;t

shareholder’s proportional ownership in the …rm. Let

Since we weight each individual’s MRS by its proportional ownership (and since shortsales in the risky asset are prohibited), only those households who are long in the risky asset
(shareholders) will receive non-zero weight in the SDF. We check that our equilibrium is
not quantitatively sensitive to this assumption on ownership control. This insensitivity is
predicted in a wide class of incomplete markets models–see FVLN for more discussion.

and transactions costs add additional terms to the price term pH
t+1 (1

H ),

but neither of

these change the de…nition of the housing service ‡ow or the de…nition of the individual
i
i
return. In a competitive equilibrium, UHa+1;t+1
=UCa+1;t+1
is equal to the relative price of

housing services. For brevity, we refer to this quantity hereafter as “rent,”but it should be
kept in mind that it is actually a measure of the ‡ow dividend from the housing asset for

owner-occupied housing. The addition of an explicit rental market would make the numerical
solution intractable, given the existing complexity.
To obtain the model’s implications for a national housing return, computed from an
aggregate house price index combined with an aggregate housing service ‡ow index (also
quantities readily observable in aggregate data), we form an aggregate (across households)
measure of the individual housing service ‡ows and refer to it as “national rent,” denoted
Rt+1 .

In the model, pH
t is the price of a unit of housing stock, which holds …xed the

composition of housing (quality, square footage, etc.) over time. It is the same for everyone,
thus it the model-based national house price index, akin to a repeat-sale index in the data.
We combine Rt+1 with the national house-price index pH
t+1 to compute a corresponding
national housing index return RH;t+1 :

We refer to pH
t+1 =Rt+1 ; as the national “price-rent” ratio for brevity. We also compute the
standard deviation of the return on the housing index return (A12), Std [RH;t+1 ], and the
ratio of the time-series mean excess return on this index, divided by the standard deviation,
SR [RH ]

E [RH;t+1 Rf;t+1 ]
:
Std [RH;t+1 Rf;t+1 ]

This latter quantity is denoted “SR [RH ]” to recall the familiar “Sharpe Ratio” concept in
…nance, but it should be emphasized that the corresponding measure here does not represent
an actual risk-return tradeo¤ that a household could earn, because it ignores the e¤ects of
housing transactions costs and binding borrowing constraints. In addition, in this case the
statistic pertains to the return on an aggregate house price index, which is not a tradeable
asset. Thus, what is denoted “SR” here is just another aggregate statistic that can be
compared across model and data, not representative of a true risk-return tradeo¤. These
measures are, however, comparable to analogous objects constructed from aggregate data
using national house price indexes and national rent or housing service ‡ow indexes.

Risky Asset and Equity Return
The …rms’values VH;t and VC;t are the cum-dividend values, measured before the dividend
is paid out. Thus the cum-dividend returns to shareholders in the housing sector and the
consumption sector are de…ned, respectively, as
RYH ;t+1 =

We de…ne Vj;t

VH;t+1
(VH;t DH;t )

RYC ;t+1 =

The gross bond return is denoted Rf;t =

qt 1

where qt

(A14)

is the bond price known at time

1.
The risky capital return RK;t in (A14) is the return on a value-weighted portfolio of risky

capital. This is not the same as the empirical return on equity, which is a levered claim on
risky capital. To obtain an equity return in the model, RS;t , the return on assets, RK;t , must
be adjusted for leverage:
RS;t

Rf;t + (1 + B=S) (RK;t

Rf;t ) ;

where B=S is the …xed debt-equity ratio and where RK;t is the portfolio return for risky
capital given in (A14).21 Note that this calculation explicitly assumes that corporate debt
in the model is exogenous, and held in …xed proportion to the value of the …rm. (There is no
…nancing decision.) For the results reported below, we set B=S = 2=3 to match aggregate
debt-equity ratios computed in Benninga and Protopapadakis (1990). This treatment of
corporate leverage is standard in the …nance literature.

The cost of capital RK is a portfolio weighted average of the return on debt Rf and the return on equity

Calibration of Stochastic Processes
Process for bF;t
Individuals in the model form beliefs about the evolution of the stochastic process for foreign
holdings relative to trend GDP, bF;t = BF;t =Y t . We assume these beliefs take the form given
in (1) and calibrate parameters of this process from U.S. data. In the data, Y t is trend GDP
as computed from a Hodrick-Prescott …lter (Hodrick and Prescott (1997)). The historical
data on BF;t consist of 115 quarterly observations between the fourth quarter of 1984 and
the second quarter of 2013, on foreign ownership of U.S. Treasury debt (T-bonds and Tnotes). As explained in the main text and shown in Figure 1 Panel B, we adjust the series
for bF;t to take into account that the supply of U.S. Treasuries started to rise after 2008,
whereas it is constant in the model. The source for these data is Department of the Treasury,
Treasury International Capital System division. The numerical grid is set to match the span
of observations on bF;t . We estimate a regression of bF;t on bF;t 4 . This leads to the parameter
combination,

Calibration of Aggregate Productivity Shocks
The aggregate technology shock processes ZC and ZH are calibrated following a two-state
Markov chain, with two possible values for each shock, fZC = ZCl ; ZC = ZCh g ;
fZH = ZHl ; ZH = ZHh g ; implying four possible combinations:
ZC = ZCl;

ZH = ZHl

ZC = ZCh;

ZH = ZHl

ZC = ZCl;

ZH = ZHh

ZC = ZCh;

ZH = ZHh:

Each shock is modeled as,
ZCl = 1

eC ;

ZCh = 1 + eC

ZHl = 1

eH ;

ZCh = 1 + eH ;

where eC and eH are calibrated to match the volatilities of GDP and residential investment
in the data.
We assume that ZC and ZH are independent of one another. Let PC be the transition
matrix for ZC and PH be the transition matrix for ZH . The full transition matrix equals

With these parameter values, we match the average length of expansions divided by the
average length of recessions (equal to 5.7 in NBER data from over the period 1945-2001).
We de…ne a recession as the event fZCl; ; ZHl; g ; so that the probability of staying in a recession

We de…ne an expansion as either the event fZCh; ZHl; g or fZCl ; ZHh g or fZCh; ZHh; g : Thus,

there are four possible states (one recession, three expansion). The average amount of time
spent in each state is given by the stationary distribution (4

Calibration of Parameters
This appendix describes in detail how we choose all other parameters of the model. All
parameter values are summarized in the table at the end of this subsection.
Parameters pertaining to the …rms’decisions are set as follows. The capital depreciation
rate, , is set to 0.12, which corresponds to the average Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
depreciation rates for equipment and structures. The housing depreciation rate

H,

is set to

0.025 following Tuzel (2009). Following Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Hansen (1985),
the capital share for the non-housing sector is set to

= 0:36: For the residential investment

sector, the value of the capital share in production is taken from a BEA study of gross product
originating, by industry. The study …nds that the capital share in the construction sector
ranges from 29.4% and 31.0% over the period 1992-1996. We therefore set the capital share in
the housing sector to

= 0:30. The adjustment costs for capital in both sectors are assumed

to be the same quadratic function of the investment to capital-ratio, '

I
K

2

, where the

constant ' is chosen to represent a tradeo¤ between the desire to match aggregate investment
volatility simultaneously with the volatility of asset returns. Under this calibration, …rms
pay a cost only for net new investment; there is no cost to replace depreciated capital. This
implies that the total adjustment cost '

I
K

2

Kt under our calibration is quite small: on

average less than one percent of investment, It . The …xed quantity of land/permits available
each period, L, is set to a level that permits the model to approximately match the housing
investment-GDP ratio. In post-war data this ratio is 6%; under our calibration of L, the
ratio ranges from 5% to 6.2%. The share of land/permits in the housing production function
is set to 10%, to match estimates in Davis and Heathcote (2005), requiring

= 0:9.

Parameters of the individual’s problem are set as follows. The subjective time discount
factor is set to

= 0:976 at annual frequency, to allow the model to match the mean of a

short-term Treasury rate in the data. The survival probability
a + 1 > 65, we set

a+1ja

a+1ja

= 1 for a + 1

65. For

equal to the fraction of households over 65 born in a particular year

alive at age a + 1; as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau. From these numbers, we obtain
the stationary age distribution in the model, and use it to match the average earnings over
the life-cycle, Ga , to that observed from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Risk aversion is

1

set to

= 8; to help the models match the high Sharpe ratio for equity observed in the

data. The weight,

on C in the utility function is set to 0.70, corresponding to a housing

expenditure share of 0.30. The regime-switching conditional variance in the unit root process
in idiosyncratic earnings is calibrated following Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2007) to
match their estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. These are
and

R

E

= 0:0768;

= 0:1296:

To calibrate the costs of equity market participation we follow results in Vissing-Jorgensen
(2002), who …nds support for the presence of a …xed, per period participation cost, but not
for the hypothesis of variable costs. She estimates the size of these costs and …nds that
they are small, less than 50 dollars per year in year 2000 dollars. These …ndings motivate
our calibration of these costs so that they are no greater than 1% of per capita, average
i

consumption, denoted F in Table 2.
We set the maximum combined LTV (…rst and second mortgages) to be 75%, corresponding to $ = 25%: It should be emphasized that 1

$ gives the maximum combined (…rst

and second mortgage) LTV ratio. This will di¤er from the average LTV ratio because not
everyone borrows up to the credit limit.
The …xed and variable housing transactions costs for housing consumption are governed
by the parameters

0

and

1.

These costs are more comprehensive than the costs of buying

and selling existing homes. They include costs of any change in housing consumption, such
as home improvements and additions, as well as non-pecuniary psychological costs. We
set the values of …xed costs

0

and variable costs

1

to be half-way between the values

speci…ed in Model 1 and Model 3 of Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008).
The Model 1 parameter values in that paper were intended to match “normal times,” a
period prior to the housing boom of 2000-2006. Model 3 parameters are calibrated to match
evidence that transactions costs for obtaining housing …nance had declined, thus lowering
these parameters. Recent existing evidence suggests we have at least partially reverted to
the Model 1 parameter values, in the aftermath of the credit crisis (see Favilukis, Kohn,
Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013)).

Thus we set parameters in between the two

calibrations. The Model 1 parameter values are anchored by setting the average number of
years that individuals in the model go without changing housing consumption equal to the

average length of residency (in years) for home owners in the Survey of Consumer Finances
across the 1989-2001 waves of the survey. This leaves a value for
3.2% of annual per capita consumption, and a value for

1

0

that is approximately

that is approximately 5.5% of

i
the value of the house pH
t Ha;t .

Similarly, we set the lending cost parameter,

= 4:5% to be half-way between the values

speci…ed in Model 1 and Model 3 of Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008).
Their estimates come from the Federal Housing Financing Board, which reports data on
mortgage origination and re…nancing costs from a survey of lenders and are also consistent
with data on fees pre dollar of real estate loans.
We set bG < 0 equal to the (negative of) the observed ratio of government debt held by
the public to trend GDP over the period 1984-2008, which is equal to 30%.
The decomposition of the population into workers and retirees is determined from lifeexpectancy tables as follows. Let X denote the total number of people born each period.
(In practice this is calibrated to be a large number in order to approximate a continuum.)
Then N W = 45 X is the total number of workers. Next, from life expectancy tables, if the
P
pa ) X is the total
probability of dying at age a > 45 is denoted pa then N R = 80
a=46 (1

Numerical Solution Procedure
The numerical solution strategy consists of solving the individual’s problem taking as given
her beliefs about the evolution of the aggregate state variables. With this solution in hand,
the economy is simulated for many individuals and the simulation is used to compute the
equilibrium evolution of the aggregate state variables, given the assumed beliefs. If the
equilibrium evolution di¤ers from the beliefs individuals had about that evolution, a new
set of beliefs are assumed and the process is repeated. Individuals’expectations are rational
once this process converges and individual beliefs coincide with the resulting equilibrium
evolution. One important note: we have no results on uniqueness. We are unaware of any
such results in the literature concerning models with the degree of complexity considered
here, as is typically the case.
The state of the economy is a pair, (Zt ;
S = (A

t) ;

Z

where
W

t

is a measure de…ned over

H) ;

where A = f1; 2; :::Ag is the set of ages, where Z is the set of all possible idiosyncratic shocks,
where W is the set of all possible beginning-of-period …nancial wealth realizations, and where
H is the set of all possible beginning-of-period housing wealth realizations. That is,

t

is

a distribution of agents across ages, idiosyncratic shocks, …nancial, and housing wealth.
Zt = (ZC;t ; ZH;t ; BF;t ; BF;t ) is a vector containing all exogenous state variables. Given a …nite
dimensional vector to approximate

t,

and a vector of individual state variables
i
t

= (zti ; wti ; hit );

the individual’s problem is solved using dynamic programming.
An important step in the numerical strategy is approximating the joint distribution of
individuals,

t,

with a …nite dimensional object. The resulting approximation, or “bounded

rationality” equilibrium has been used elsewhere to solve overlapping generations models
with heterogenous agents and aggregate risk, including Krusell and Smith (1998); Ríos-Rull
and Sánchez-Marcos (2006); Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2007); Gomes and Michaelides
(2008); Favilukis (2013), among others. the aggregate resource constraint for this economy
implies that the net change in the value of foreign capital, or the trade balance, in‡uences

current spending relative to current resources. For this reason, both BF;t+1 and BF;t are
aggregate state variables as of time t. For our application, we approximate this space with
a vector of aggregate state variables other than BF;t and BF;t+1 with (in detrended values)
AG
t

= (zC;t ; zH;t ; kt ; St ; ht ; pH
t ; qt );

where
Kt = KC;t + KH;t
and
KC;t
:
KC;t + KH;t
The state variables are the observable aggregate technology shocks, the …rst moment of the
St =

aggregate capital stock, the share of aggregate capital used in production of the consumption
good, the aggregate stock of housing, and the relative house price and bond price, respectively. The bond and the house price are natural state variables because the joint distribution
of all individuals only matters for the individual’s problem in so far as it a¤ects asset prices.
Note that knowledge of Kt and St is tantamount to knowledge of KC;t and KH;t separately,
and vice versa (KC;t = Kt St ; KH;t = Kt (1

St )).

To solve the model, all variables are divided by the trend component exp (gt) to obtain
policy functions and state variables have invariant distributions. In the simulations, we
recover the levels of the variables by multiplying them by exp (gt) and returns are multiplied
by (1 + g) :
Because of the large number of state variables and because the problem requires that
prices in two asset markets (housing and bond) must be determined by clearing markets every
period, the proposed problem is highly numerically intensive. To make the problem tractable,
we obviate the need to solve the dynamic programming problem of …rms numerically by
instead solving analytically for a recursive solution to value function taking the form V (Kt ) =
Qt Kt , where Qt (Tobin’s q) is a recursive function. We discuss this below.
In order to solve the individual’s dynamic programming problem, the individual must
know

and

i
t+1

as a function of

AG
t

and

i
t

and aggregate shocks Zt+1 = (ZC;t ; ZH;t ; BF;t ; BF;t+1 ).

Here we show that this can be achieved by specifying individuals’beliefs for the laws of motion of four quantities:

insure that individuals’beliefs are consistent with the resulting equilibrium.

can solve for KC;t+1 using the accumulation equation KC;t+1 = (1

The above problem is solved subject to (5) and (6), if the individual of working age, and
subject to the analogous versions of (5) and (6), (using pension income in place of wage
income), if the individual is retired. The problem is also solved subject to an evolution
equation for the state space:

is the system of forecasting equations that is obtained by stacking all the beliefs from

(A15) and accumulation equations into a single system. This step requires us to make
an initial guess for A(0) in equations (A1)-(A4). This dynamic programming problem is
quite complex numerically because of a large number of state variables but is otherwise
straightforward. Its implementation is described below.
The collateral constraint faced by each household implies that net worth is non-negative
so that accidental bequests are non-negative. If household i dies in period t then his net
worth at death, left accidentally, is equivalent to the amount inherited by the newborn who
replaces the dead individual. We allow the newborn to make an optimal portfolio choice
over risky assets, bonds, and housing for how the bequeathed wealth is allocated in the …rst
period of life. Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) study a model in which,
in addition to these accidental bequests, some small fraction of households leave intentional
bequests, driven by a bequest motive in their value functions.
Next we simulate the economy for a large number of individuals using the policy functions from the dynamic programming problem. Using data from the simulation, we calculate
(A1)-(A4) as linear functions of {
e t and an initial guess A(0) . In particular, for every Zt and

Zt+1 combination we regress (A1)-(A4) on Kt , St , Ht , pH
t , and qt . This is used to calculate a
new A(n) = A(1) which is used to re-solve for the entire equilibrium. We continue repeating
this procedure, updating the sequence

A(n) ; n = 0; 1; 2; ::: until (1) the coe¢ cients in

A(n) between successive iterations is arbitrarily close, (2) the regressions have high R2 statistics, and (3) the equilibrium is invariant to the inclusion of additional state variables such

as additional lags and/or higher order moments of the cross-sectional wealth and housing
distribution.
During the simulation step, an additional numerical complication is that two markets
(the housing and bond market) must clear each period. This makes pH
t and qt convenient
state variables: the individual’s policy functions are a response to a menu of prices pH
t and qt .

Given values for YH;t , Ha+1;t+1
, Ha;t
, Ba;t
and BtF form the simulation, and given the menu
H
of prices pH
t and qt and the beliefs (A15), we then choose values for pt+1 and qt+1 that clear

markets in t + 1. The initial allocations of wealth and housing are set arbitrarily to insure
that prices in the initial period of the simulation, pH
1 and q1 , clear markets. However, these
values are not used since each simulation includes an initial burn-in period of 150 years that
we discard for the …nal results.
The procedure just described requires a numerical solution to the individual’s problem,
a simulation using that solution for a large number of agents, and then a repetition (many
times) of this procedure using the updated coe¢ cients in A(n) . The continuum of individuals
born each period is approximated by a number large enough to insure that the mean and
volatility of aggregate variables is not a¤ected by idiosyncratic shocks. We check this by
simulating the model for successively larger numbers of individuals in each age cohort and
checking whether the mean and volatility of aggregate variables changes. We have solved
the model for several di¤erent numbers of agents. For numbers ranging from a total of
2,500 to 25,000 agents in the population we found no signi…cant di¤erences in the aggregate
allocations.
The R2 statistics for the four equations (A1)-(A4) are (.999, .997, .999, .996), respectively.
These R2 are for 2,500 individuals. We found that successively increasing the number of
individuals (beyond 2,500) successively increases the R2 without a¤ecting the equilibrium
allocations or prices. However, we could not readily increase the number of agents beyond
25,000 because attempts to do so exceeded the available memory on a workstation computer.
Our interpretation of this …nding is that the equilibrium is unlikely to be a¤ected by an
approximation using more agents, even though doing so could result in an improvement in
the R2 .

Numerical Solution to Individual’s Dynamic Programming Problem
We now describe how the individual’s dynamic programming problem is solved.
First we choose grids for the continuous variables in the state space. That is we pick a
set of values for wi , hi , k, h, S, pH , and q. Because of the large number of state variables,
it is necessary to limit the number of grid points for some of the state variables given
memory/storage limitations. We found that having a larger number of grid points for the
individual state variables was far more important than for the aggregate state variables, in
terms of the e¤ect it had on the resulting allocations. Thus we use a small number of grid
points for the aggregate state variables but compensate by judiciously choosing the grid point
locations after an extensive trial and error experimentation designed to use only those points
that lie in the immediate region where the state variables ultimately reside in the computed
equilibria. As such, a larger number of grid points for the aggregate state variables was
found to produce very similar results to those reported using only a small number of points.
We pick 26 points for wti , 13 points for hit , three points for kt , ht , St , pH
t , bF;t , bF;t+1 and
four points for qt . The grid for wi starts at the borrowing constraint and ends far above
the maximum wealth reached in simulation. This grid is very dense around typical values of
…nancial wealth and is sparser for high values. The housing grid is constructed in the same
way.
Given the grids for the state variables, we solve the individual’s problem by value function
iteration, starting for the oldest (age A) individual and solving backwards. The oldest individual’s value function for the period after death is zero for all levels of wealth and housing.
Hence the value function in the …nal period of life is given by
subject to the constraints above for (A25). Given

U (ciA ; hiA )

(calculated for every point on the

state space), we then use this function to solve the problem for a younger individual (aged
A

1). We continue iterating backwards until we have solved the youngest individual’s

(age 1) problem. We use piecewise cubic splines (Fortran methods PCHIM and CHFEV) to
interpolate points on the value function. Any points that violate a constraint are assigned a
large negative value.
