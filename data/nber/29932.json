    "abstract": "\n\nThe labor-force participation rates of prime-age U.S. workers dropped in March 2020\u2014the start of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014and have still not fully recovered.  At the same time,  substance-abuse deaths were elevated during the pandemic relative to trend indicating an increase in the number of substance abusers, and abusers of opioids and crystal methamphetamine have lower labor-force participation rates than non-abusers.  Could increased substance abuse during the pandemic be a factor contributing to the fall in labor-force participation? Estimates of the number of additional substance abusers during the pandemic presented here suggest that increased substance abuse accounts for between 9 and 26 percent of the decline in prime-age labor-force participation between February 2020 and June 2021.\n\n",
