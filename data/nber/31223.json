    "abstract": "\n\nWe use a five percent sample of Americans\u2019 credit bureau data, combined with a regression discontinuity approach, to estimate the effect of universal health insurance at age 65\u2014when most Americans become eligible for Medicare\u2014at the national, state, and local level. We find a 30 percent reduction in debt collections\u2014and a two-thirds reduction in the geographic variation in collections\u2014with limited effects on other financial outcomes. The areas that experienced larger reductions in collections debt at age 65 were concentrated in the Southern United States, and had higher shares of black residents, people with disabilities, and for-profit hospitals.\n\n",
