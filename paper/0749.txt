REAL EXCHANGE RATE OVERSHOOTING AND THE OUTPUT COST
OF BRINGING DOWN INFLATION

Abs tract
Implementing

a 'gradualist' policy of monetary contraction, in an

open economy with a freely floating exchange rate but with nominal inertia
in domestic labor costs, can lead to prompt and substantial changes in

the nominal and real exchange rate. One of the virtues claimed for such
exchange rate 'overshooting', however, is its immediate effect on the
price level and so on domestic wage and price inflation.
In this paper we show that, in a model which is 'super—neutral' and
has nominal inertia in both the level of labor costs and their trend or
core rate of growth, this early overshooting of the exchange rate does
not succeed in cutting the output costs of reducing steady—state inflation.
Those output and unemployment costs which are initially avoided by over—
valuing the currency have to be paid later when this overvaluation is

corrected. Relative to other policies which achieve the same effect on
steady—state inflation, exchange rate overshooting brings inflation down
more quickly.

1. Introduction
The proposition that under a floating exchange rate regime restrictive
monetary policy can lead to substantial "overshooting" of the nominal and
real exchange rate is now accepted fairly widely.

The fundamental reason

is the presence of nominal stickiness or inertia in domestic factor and
product markets cohibined with a freely flexible nominal exchange rate.

Current and anticipated future monetary policy actions are reflected
immediately in the nominal exchange rate, set as it is in a forward-looking
efficient auction market, while they are reflected only gradually and with

a lag in domestic nominal labour costs and/or goods prices.

Nominal

appreciation of the currency therefore amounts to real appreciation - a
loss of competitiveness.

Since in most of the simple analytical models

used to analyse the overshooting propositions there is no long-run effect
of monetary policy on the real exchange rate, any short-run real appreciation
implies an overshooting of the long-run equilibrium.

The transitory (but

potentially quite persistent) loss of competitiveness is associated with a
decline in output below its capacity level.

This excess capacity is one

of the channels through which restrictive monetary policy brings down the
rate of domestic cost and price inflation.

One of the virtues claimed for the sharp initial appreciation of the
nominal and real exchange rate in response to a previously unanticipated
tightening of the stance of monetary policy is its immediate effect on
the domestic price level.

The domestic currency prices of those inter-

nationally traded goods whose foreign currency prices can be treated as
exogenous will decline by the same proportion as the increase in the value
of the domestic currency.

To a greater or lesser extent the same holds

even for those internationally traded goods where the home country is
large in relation to the world market.

Both through its effect on the

Subject

to one quite significant qualification, the core rate of inflation is viewed
as predetermined with its behaviour over time governed by a first order
partial adjustment mechanism.

It can be thought of as an adaptive

expectations mechanism for the labour market although we do not favour that
interpretation.

In our view the core rate of inflation,which is a

distributed lag on past rates of inflation, stands for all the factors in
the economy that give inertia to built-in trends in wages and prices.
Also, while the level of the money wage is always treated as predetermined,

determined by a "backward—looking" process,can make discrete

jumps at a point in time.

This will happen whenever there is a discrete

jump in the general price level.

In our model this can occur either if

the exchange rate jumps or if there is a change in indirect taxes.

Since

the exchange rate is a forward-looking price which responds to "news"
about current and future shocks, the underlying rate of inflation indirectly
and to a limited extent also responds to such shocks.

To put the present paper in perspective it is useful to relate our
current approach to that of an earlier paper (Buiter and Miller [1981]).
This is done in Section 2 where a simple model of real exchange rate

flexibility of domestic nominal wage costs.

While we do not believe

that such a "neo-classical" specification is appropriate for the analysis
of an advanced industrial economy like the U.K., the discussion of this
case helps bring out the crucial nature of the assumption of nominal
inertia in the behaviour of domestic costs.

Section 4 analyzes in some

detail the behaviour of the model with sluggish "core" inflation.

rate on time deposits (rd).

The nominal interest falls in response

to the monetary growth deceleration, reflecting the current and anticipated
future success of the anti-inflationary strategy.

To equate the demand for

money to its predetermined real supply, output falls.

The reduction in

output is achieved both through appreciation of the real exchange rate and
through the increase in the real interest rate. To avoid the conclusion
of our model that a reduction in the rate of growth of the money stock
lowers the nominal interest rate, the money demand function would have to be
modified.

Possible modifications are the following.

c) The medium term financial strategy
The medium term financial strategy (MTFS) of the Thatcher government
had as its centrepiece an announced sequence of 4 annual one point reductions
in the target range of monetary growth.

Approximating the range by its

central value, the response of the system to the unanticipated and immediate
introduction of the MTFS can be depicted as in Figure 2.

monetary growth, c would jump immediately to

The actual effect is intermediate between these two extremes.

The

initial jump in c takes it beyond E12 to a point such as T
because the magnitude of the initial jump in c is a function of the
announced future reductions in monetary growth.

Under rational

expectations the system must follow a path which will, without future

jumps in competitiveness, put it on S4S4 when the fourth and final
year of the MTFS dawns .

We

assume that no further reductions in

monetary growth are planned after the fourth year.

If a non-inflationary

rate of monetary growth is the long-term target and if the MTFS is
likely to be extended to achieve this purpose, a further 5 or 6 years of

successive one percentage point reductions in Dm should be added to the
pictu'e of Figure 2.

d) An unanticipated increase in indirect taxes
To model the important monetary aspects of the Conservative government's
fiscal policy, we consider a fiscally-neutral increase in the rate of indirect
taxation,

0 .

There is assumed to be no direct effect on aggregate demand

because the increase in indirect taxes is matched by a reduction in direct
taxes.

The price equation "at factor cost" is assumed unaffected by the

reduction in direct taxes.

To justify this assumption for the wage

component of factor costs, one could plausibly postulate a labour supply schedule
that is perfectly inelastic with respect to the after—tax real wage.

Neither policy action affects long-run

competitiveness, but while a once-and-fcr-all increase in the level of the
nominal money stock leaves long—run real balances unchanged, an increase
in the rate of growth of the nominal money stock will, by raising inflation
and the nominal interest rate, reduce the long—run stock of real money
balances.

the excess capacity and the loss of competitiveness associated with policies

It can be

argued that the government's decision not to try to recoup the large
overshoot during the second half of 1980 of the £M3 target amounts to an
(involuntary) in-jump of the kind advocated here.

Whatever the motivation,

it has prevented a further massive deflationary jolt to an economy already
going through the worst recession since the 1930's.

3. Real Exchange Rate Overshooting and the Wage—price Process
A crucial component of all models exhibiting disequilibrium overshooting
of the real exchange rate is the wage-price process.

The price equation

used in the paper so far, as in many others (e.g. Buiter and Miller [1981],
Dornbusch [1976]) has a number of weaknesses.

It is important to perform

— 16 -

a "sensitivity analysis" of the specification of this equation in order to

establish the robustness of the overshooting proposition.

a) A direct effect of the exchange rate on the domestic price level
Even if domestic wage costs are sticky in nominal terms, so that the

money wage rate, w , can be treated as predetermined, the domestic price
level might in an open economy still be capable of making discrete jumps
at a point in time.

This will be the case if the domestic currency price

of internationally traded goods is a function of the exchange rate.

A convenient way of representing this notion is to express the domestic

price level, p , as a weighted average of the sticky domestic money wage
and the domestic currency value of an appropriate (trade—weighted) index

4.

The Real Exchange Rate and the Output Cost of Monetary Disinflation in
a Model with sluggish "Core" Inflation
In this Section we solve the model of equations (25) and (26) for the
time paths of selected variables, using a particular set of "plausible"
parameter values.

The numerical example is designed to focus on the role

of the real and nominal exchange rate in monetary disinflation.

Two

common channels of the monetary transmission mechanism are intentionally
closed off.

Thus "core" inflation in the lalxur market is backward looking

(although

will jump i.f.f. e jumps) and in addition, it is assumed

that aggregate demand is interest inelastic: the IS curve is vertical.
The real exchange rate continues to function as an effective channel of
monetary policy, which is successful in bringing down steady-state inflation.
We refer to this as policy A.

We examine the mechanism through which inflation is reduced and calculate
the costs in terms of lost output, incurred in the process.

We also examine

an alternative policy, referred to asP0l]CYE, which reduces the long run
rate of inflation by the same extent without varying the real exchange rate,
but following the same path of output.

We note that these policies differ

in their effects on the price level, even in the long run.

In the short run,

the recession induced by an overvalued exchange rate will show a sharper fall
in the rate of inflation than the recession of equal magnitude induced by the
alternative policy that keeps the real exchange rate constant.

In the former

case, there will also be an immediate fall in the price level, which is
absent in the latter.

Since the long-run real exchange rate is independent

of the rate of monetary growth, the initial jump decline in c = e - w

policyA will be followed by a gradual increase in e - w
level.

lower relative to the path of the nominal money stock, since the lower

steady state rate of inflation is associated with a higher stock of real money
balances.

It is possible (but not necessary) for e to overshoot its new

steady state path) In that case De will not only exceed Dw on
balance during the adjustment process, it will also on balance exceed the
new, lower, rate of monetary growth.

designed to attain the same reduction

A, but without any loss of output.

This

policy involves a cut in indirect taxes and (in general) a change in the level
of the nominal stock of money.

As long as w is predetermined, the output cost of achieving a given
reduction in the steady state rate of inflation (defined as the cumulative
net amount of excess capacity) is entirely independent of the exchange rate.
While it may be possible to bring forward the anti—inflationary gains, it is
not possible to reduce the net output cost of bringing down inflation by
engineering an early appreciation of the real exchange rate.

This effect is due to two factors; the

the costs of eliminating inflation as measured by the size and duration

The evidence on this is, however,

by no means clear.

In order to see how much the initial loss of competitiveness contributes

to the speed with which inflation is reduced and to cutting the cost of
reducing inflation we consider alternative policies which keep competitiveness

by construction, money has become a complete "side-show".

Note that,
Two of the

transmission mechanisms, the real balance effect and an interest rate effect
in the goods market, have been ruled out from the start.

Now that the real

exchange rate is also kept constant, there is no feedback from money on real
output.

Since the model has the standard homogeneity properties, it will

of course still be true that in the long run the rate of inflation equals
the rate of growth of the money supply.

As will become clear, however,

the truism that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"

should in the current example be turned around: money here is an inflation
phenomenon.

The first alternative policy (CalkdB) takes the path of output to be
precisely the same as that generated by the monetary contraction just described

with policy A.This can be achieved e.g. by adding a fiscal instrument g to
the IS curve so that

Other ways of stabilizing

What is apparent from the above is that the policy of fighting inflation

by cycles in output and in the real exchange rate (with an initial recession
associated with an overvalued exchange rate) does not lead to any change in
long run inflation, compared to the same output cycle and a stable real
exchange rate.

The loss of competitiveness does however reduce inflation

more quickly early on, as shown in Figure l; the early lead established
by this policy over the alternative is whittled away later when competitiveness
is regained in the boom, but we are left with the conclusions that inflation
is brought down more quickly with policy A, as shown by the dotted line in

The fiuctuatiorof the real exchange rate can therefore be seen to have
effects on inflation not unlike those attributed to temporary incomes policies
by those who argue that the latter hold down inflation in the short run,
but have no effect on the inflation rate in the long run.

If that is true,

then a temporary rout of incomes policy would change only the long run price
level without changing the long run growth of prices, which is what we have
found to be characteristic of the policy of permitting the real exchange rate
to vary.

The mechanism permitting the required reduction in inflation to be
brought about without loss of output is the following. First, the cut in
0 (in general together with the change in m) permits the long—run change in
the stock of real money balances to be brought about immediately without
any need for a jump in nominal prices, including the exchange rate.

Second,

the cut in 0 achieves the immediate change in the core rate of inflation
to its new long-run value.

The use of indirect taxes to facilitate the

process of bringing down inflation has been advocated frequently by Okun
[1978].

Conclusion

After a summary of various approaches to the modelling of the inflationary
process in an open economy with a floating exchange rate, we have studied the
way in which a monetary slowdown might be expected to work in an economy where
core inflation is sluggish, and adjusts to actual inflation with a significant

mean lag.

—5 0 Despite such sluggishness we found that core inflation can be reduced
quickly by jumps in the price level induced by jumps in the exchange rate.
In the simple model used to focus on this particular aspect of the monetary
transmission mechanism we found that, even without any direct real balance and
real interest rate effects on aggregate demand, a monetary slowdown might
nevertheless cut inflation promptly via its impact on the nominal and the
real exchange rate.

Indeed our numerical example has the property that the

Thus reduction of inflation follows, in our

example, from the

of announced monetary policy on the exchange rate.

The appreciation

of the exchange rate cuts the inflation rate in two ways, first by reducing
core inflation and second by cutting the level of output.

Both of these

effects involve sharp changes in the real exchange rate.

Since the model is "super-neutral", however, such changes in the real
exchange rate and in real output must ultimately be reversed.

Pursuit of a

constant growth rate of money generates a cyclical convergence for these
variables.

The net output costs associated with a steady state reduction in

inflation are found to be given by a simple formula, dp/ where dji

Thus for

the net output loss associated with reducing monetary

growth and steady state inflation by 1% is 4 point years of GNP.

For comparison we considered an alternative where the real exchange was
held constant but output was constrained to follow the same path as before.

Such an alternative, whose net output loss is of course identical, was found
to achieve the same effect on steady state inflation, but the path taken by
inflation was different.

The prompt anti—inflation success due to the loss

of competitiveness being absent, inflation starts fro a higher level under
this alternative.

was flatter and the mean lag of core inflation longer, showed even higher

In considering tiefficientil disinflationary policies, we noted that a cut

in indirect taxes could reduce the output costs of curing inflation by
securing an immediate

jump reduction in the price index at market prices and

in the core rate of inflation.

In

the U.K., a one point cut in VAT is reckoned to cut the rate of

therefore avoid the four point year of output loss otherwise associated
with a point reduction in monetary growth.

The present administration's

decision to raise VAT by 8 points early in their term of office, at the
same time that a programme of successive reductions in monetary growth was
announced, would in our model increase the cost of bringing down inflation.
In the short run however, the adverse consequences of the VAT increase on

the price level are countered by the appreciation of the exchange rate.

Those who argue that incomes policies can secure a step reduction in
core inflation, would of course advocate their use as a way of cutting the
output costs of reducing inflation (see, for example, Tobin [1977)).

We

We have however,

considered the possibility that announced monetary policy could immediately
and directly reduce core inflation in just such a fashion.

If announced

monetary policy has this sort of direct expectational effect, then it will
save output costs, just as a similarly successful incomes policy would.

If, however, monetary targets only secure immediate effects on core inflation
by a sudden loss of competitiveness, this will not constitute an "efficient"
way of reducing inflation.
