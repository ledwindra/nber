Distribution Costs and Real Exchange Rate Dynamics During
Exchange-Rate-Based-Stabilizations

ABSTRACT
This paper studies the role played by the distribution sector in shaping the behavior of the real

exchange rate during exchange-rate-based-stabilizations. We use data for the U.S. and Argentina to
document the importance of distribution margins in retail prices and disaggregated price data to study

price dynamics in the aftermath of Argentina's 1991 Convertibility plan. Distribution services require
local labor and land so they drive a natural wedge between retail prices in different countries. We study
in detail the impact of introducing a distribution sector in an otherwise standard model of exchange-rate-

based-stabilizations. We show that this simple extension improves dramatically the ability of the model

to rationalize observed real exchange rate dynamics.

1. IntrOduction
There is a large literature that studies the macroeconomic impact of exchangerate-based stabilizations. This literature has made substantial progress in explaining the behavior of consumption, investment and the current account during

stabilizations (see Calvo and Végh (1999) for a recent survey). In contrast, the

magnitude of the real exchange rate (RER) movements during these episodes
remains difficult to understand.
Calvo and Végh (1999) find that the average RER appreciation between the
year prior to the stabilization and the second year of the stabilization period in
seven stabilization episodes in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Israel was 20%.'.

In Argentina, the country we will use as benchmark in this paper, the real exchange rate appreciated by roughly 25% between April 1991, the date in which
the Convertibility plan was enacted, and April 1993.
These large RER appreciations are at odds with the predictions of standard
models. In a quantitative study of the effects of exchange-rate-based stabilizations

Rebelo and Végh (1995) find an upper bound of roughly 8% for the increase
in the relative price of non-tradables. This translates approximately into a 4%
appreciation of the real exchange rate.

The standard model used to study exchange-rate-based stabilization features

two goods, a tradable and a non-tradable. Purchasing power parity (PPP) is
assumed to hold only for the tradable good.2 In this setting the RER fails to move
'Calvo and Vegh (1999) studied the period 1978-1993. The episodes included in their sample
are: the 1978 'tablitas' in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, the Argentine 1985 Austral plan, the
1990 Uruguay plan, and the 1991 Argentine Convertibility Act.
2For examples of models of exchange rate based stabilizations that rely on this assumption
see Calvo and Végh (1993) Roldos (1995), Uribe (1997), and Mendoza and Uribe (1999). For
an analysis of this class of models in a business cycle context see Stockman and Tesar (1995).
Betts and Kehoe (1999) explore a more elaborate version of the tradables/non-tradables set up
in which different goods vary in their degree of tradability.

significantly when there is substitutability between tradables and Eon-tradables
in utility or in production.

In Section 2 we use disggregated price data for Argentina for the period
1991-1998 to study the price movements that underlie the large real exchange
rate appreciation associated with the Convertibility plan enacted in April 1991.
Using the comparable components of the CPI for the US and Argentina we find
that most of the real exchange rate appreciation was due to increases in the prices

of tradable goods. This suggests that understanding movements in the RER
requires a model in which PPP does not hold for tradable goods.

To study whether the failure of PPP for tradable goods can be accounted for
by the cost of local distribution services (transport, wholesale and retail services,

marketing, etc.), we examine data on distribution margins for Argentina and the

US. This data suggests that distribution costs represent at least half of the retail
price of consumer goods. For some tradable agricultural products distribution

accounts for roughly 80% of the final retail price of the product. Thus it is not
surprising that, even though these goods are traded across countries, their prices
are nor equalized.

Motivated by this empirical evidence we propose a model that embodies the
notion, discussed in Sanyal and Jones (1982) and Erceg .and Levin (1996), that
there are no freely traded goods.3 We assume that all goods embody an important
component of distribution services. Since these services, are intensive in local labor

and land and hence non-tradable, they create a natural wedge between the prices

of tradable goods in different countries. Our analysis is complementary to that
of Erceg and Levin (1996) who study the effects of technology shocks in models
3Dumas (1992), Sercu, Uppal, and Van Hulle (1995), and Benninga and Protopapadakis
(1998) discuss models with international trade costs. These models are significantly different
from ours because they assume that goods produced domestically can be distributed at no
cost. For this reason they feature a no-trade zone—there are circumstances in which it is not
worthwhile to pay the costs associated with international trade:

3

that incorporate a distribution sector and investment in structures.
In Section 3 we review a standard small open economy model in which the

RER is driven solely by the relative price of non-tradables. In Section 4 we
introduce a distribution sector into the basic model. Section 5 discusses model
calibration. In Section 6 we evaluate the quantitative implications of both models

by studying a permanent stabilization. We show that the model with distribution

produces much more realistic movements in the RER relative to the standard
model. We then extend the distribution model by incorporating investment irreversibilities and capital immobility as well as a construction sector. In Section

7 we study the implications of the basic model, with and without a distribution

sector for the case of a temporary stabilization. A final section summarizes the
main results and discusses directions for future research.

2. Empirical Motivation
Table 1 describes the evolution of disaggregated price indexes for the various com-

ponents of the Argentine consumer price index between March 1991 and March

1998. Table 2 reports the ratio of price indexes in Argentina and in the US for
comparable components of the CPI. The interpretation of this data is not straight-

forward. The 1991 Convertibility Plan was not a pristine natural experiment that
allows us to isolate the impact of the exchange-rate-based stabilization. Among

the other shocks that impacted the Argentine economy was the Mercosur free
trade agreement. This agreement began its implementation in June 1992, leading

to a gradual lifting of tariffs on imports from Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay'
Tariffs on imports from non-Mercosur countries were also introduced in 1993 and

1995. In addition, various forms of price controls were eliminated after 1991.
4We suspect that the Mercosur tariff and quota reductions are the reason for the small price
increases in a few tradable goods categories in Table 1, such as footwear.

4

Table 2 shows that, relative to the US, the prices of some non-tradable goods
•

and services increased significantly between 1991 and 1993, for example the price
of educational services increased by 35%. This table also suggest that the increases

in the prices of certain non-tradable goods may have been moderated by price
controls (examples are public transportation and medical care commodities). But
the most surprising feature of the data summarized in these tables is that relative
PPP does not hold for tradable goods. Relative to the US the price of alcoholic
beverages and fats and oils increased by more than 30%. The price of cereals,
• meats, non-alcoholic beverages and dairy all increased by more than 40%.
We can use the data in Table 2 to compute the Argentine peso/US dollar RER
based on the CPI. The categories in this table represent 68% and 74% of the goods

included in the CPI of Argentina and the US, respectively. We renormalized the
weights of the different goods in the US and Argentina so that they sum to 100%
and constructed price indexes for tradables and non-tradables for both countries.5
We defined the real exchange rate in terms of the geometric consumer price indexes

in the two countries:
RER = [S(Ps) (Pg) l_7US]/[(PT )YAr (pi"TT) 1_1Ar}

where PT and NT are the prices of tradables and non-tradables in country i,

respectively, and S is the peso/dollar exchange rate. The variable -y denotes the
weight of tradable goods in the CPI of country i. The first panel of Figure 1 shows
the evolution of the logarithm of the RER from April 1991 to March 1998 (the

RER was normalized to one in April 1991). The RER appreciated by 25.3% in
5Our list of tradable goods is: Cereals, Meats, Dairy, Sugar and sweets, Fats and oils, Nonalcoholic beverages, Alcoholic beverages, Fuel and other utilities, Furniture and bedding, Housekeeping supplies, Footwear, New vehicles, Medical care commodities, Tobacco, Toilet Goods and
personal care appliances, and School books and supplies. We classified as non-tradables the fol-

lowing goods: Food away from home, Rents (residential), Maintenance and repair of private
tranportation, Public transportation, Medical care services, Personal care services, arid College
tuition.

the first two years of the convertibility plan (from April 1991 to April 1993) and
became roughly stable in subsequent periods.

We can to decompose the change in the US-Argentina RER along the lines
suggested by Engel (1999). Since the nominal exchange rate has been constant
during the period that we consider, we can express the change in the RER as:

log(RER) =

log(P'J/P)— (17Ar)L log(PT/PJ),
(2.1)

Between April 1991 and April 1993

log(RER) = —25.3%. Most of this change
was accounted by movements in the price of tradable goods: 1og(Pg/Pj) =
—24.1%

with only -1.2% accounted for by movements in the relative price of non-

tradables.
There is other empirical evidence that suggest that the prices of tradable goods

are inconsistent with the relative PPP hypothesis. Dornbusch (1989) summarizes

data from the World Bank national income comparison project to show that the

price of an identical consumption basket, constructed with detailed price data,
is higher in high income countries than in low income economies. He suggests
that distribution services may account for this failure of PPP. Giovannini (1988)

rejects the absolute PPP hypothesis by comparing prices in the US and Japan
for individual intermediate inputs used in manufacturing, such as nuts and bolts.
Isard (1977) rejects the relative PPP hypothesis using highly disaggregated traded

goods price indexes for the US, Canada, Germany, and Japan. Finally, Engel
(1999) finds that the movements in the US real exchange rate cannot be accounted

for by movements in the relative price of non-tradables. This accords with our
findings for Argentina where most of the movement in the RER is accounted for
changes in the prices of tradable goods.

Why does PPP fail for traded goods? Transportation costs seem too small to
6

explain the observed large deviations from PPP.6 However, distribution costs as a
whole (including wholesale and retail services, marketing, etc.) can be much more
significant than the costs of transporting goods across countries.7 Feenstra (1998)

discusses the production and distribution costs for Mattel's Barbie doll, which
is a colorful, but suggestive example of the importance of distribution services
in modern economies. The doll is produced in Asia at a cost of one dollar per
unit (35 cents for labor and 65 centh for materials). It costs an additional dollar
of distribution services to get the doll to the Hong Kong harbor, and then to
the US. Mattel makes one dollar of profit from each doll. The sale price is $10

dollars of which $7 pay for transportation, marketing, and retail services in the
US. Production costs are a mere 10% of .the retail price of the product.
This example may be non-representative but there are many other instances
in which the cost of distribution is significantly larger than the production cost.
The US Department of Agriculture collects data on production and distribution

costs for agricultural products. Table 3 shows the fraction of the retail price of
food that is accounted for by the farm price of the produce. In all of the product categories distribution costs are more important than production costs. The
weight of distribution costs in the final price range from 54% (eggs) to 82% (fresh

fruits) .
The importance of distribution costs is not restricted to agricultural goods.

Euromoney (1997, Table 3:48) estimates that in 1996 the average gross margin
5Rauch (1996) computes transporation costs (insurance and freight as percentage of customs
value) for U.S. imports from Japan or similarly distant countries for 1970, 1980 and 1990. He
obtains estimates that range from 6% to 16%. Hurnmels (1999) estimates the average tradeweighted freight cost in 1994 to be 3,8% for the U.S. and 7.5% for Argentina.
7See Rogoff (1996) and Froot and Rogoff (1995) for a comprehensive discussion of reasons
for the failure of the PPP hypothesis, including pricing to market behavior.
8This weight does not seem closely related to the perishable character of the different goods.
For example, fats and oils, which are arguably less perishable than eggs, have a distribution
weight of 79%.

7

as a percentage of retail sales in the US across all goods except automobiles was
36.2%.

The 1992 Input-Output table for the US economy is another source of valuable

information on the importance of distribution costs. This information is summarized in Tables 4 and 5. Note that in some sectors the distribution costs could not

be isolated from the production. costs, since some goods are sold directly by the
producer to theretailer or consumer (see Betancourt (1992)). For this reason the

estimates in these table are likely to represent a lower bound on the importance
of distribution.

A complementary source of information on US distribution costs are the Cen-

sus of Wholesale and Retail Trade published by the Department of Commerce.

Table 6 summarizes the information contained in these surveys regarding mar-

gins, value added and labor costs. The distribution margin, computed as value
9

added/sales is 30% in the retail sector and 20% in the wholesale sector.'° This
means that the distribution component of a good that is sold by the producer to
the wholesaler and then from the wholesaler to the retailer represents 44% of the
retail price. However, not all goods go through both distribution channels.

Data on distribution costs in Argentina is scarce. However, the information
that exists, summarized in Table 7, suggests that distribution margins are high,

on the order of 61% of the retail price." These high margins probably reflect
inefficiencies in the Argentine distribution system. Bailey (1993) and Itoh (2000)

attribute the high distribution margins observed in Japan to a system of small
retail stores and long tunnels of small wholesalers. Similar problems seem to
plague the Argentine distribution system, which is comprised by numerous small
retailers.12
'°Value added is computed as the gross margin less the cost of supplies, materials, fuel and
other energy, and the cOst of contract work on materials of the wholesaler. The gross margin is
computed as sales less cost of goods sold.
'1We cannot extract information about distribution costs from the 1997 input-output matrix
for Argentina. This matrix is computed using "basic prices" which exclude distribution margins
and transportation costs as well as indirect taxes and subsidies. Data on distribution margins•
for Argentina is currently being produced for 1997. In the preliminary version of this data,
the margins for most sectors are in the 20%—40% range. This information is not comparable
with that of Table 6 because it mixes consumer goods with intermediate inputs and investment
goods. The fact that intermediate inputs and investment goods have lower distribution margins
probably accounts for the lower margin estimates in this preliminary data.
'2The Census of Retail and Wholesale estimates that there were 506,659 establishments in the
sector in 1993; roughly one establishment for every 70 inhabitants. Large supermarkets account
only for 5.4% of the employment in the retail sector in 1999 according to the Coordinadora de
Actividades Mercantiles Empresariais.

To shed more light on the importance of distribution costs in Argentina, we
computed the RER using the wholesale price index (WPI) for Argentina and the

US producer price index; This measure of the RER, is displayed on the second

panel of Figure 1. While the CPI-based RER appreciated by 25.3% in the first
two years of the stabilization plan, the WPI-based RER appreciated only by
2.7%. This reflects the absence of non-tradables from the WPI, as well as its
lower distribution cost component.

Table 8 describes the structure of employment and value added in the US
and in Argentina in 1997. This table, which shows that the distribution sector is
large, both in terms of employment and value added, provides further evidence
that distribution costs are economically significant.
The evidence described above suggests an obvious, simple way of improving

both the realism and the performance of existing models: the introduction of a
distribution sector whose services are necessary so that tradable goods can be
consumed. We will show that the way in which distribution services are introduced is important, both for the fraction of RER variation that is accounted
for by changes in the relative price of non-tradables and for the behavior of the
tradable-non-tradable consumption mix. At the same time, this evidence can be
interpreted as fitting squarely into the standard tradables-non-tradables framework. However, we will see that the implications of our model with distribution
cannot be replicated by increasing the share of non-tradable consumption in the
standard model.

12

3. A Basic Model
We start by reviewing a simple version of the standard tradables-non-tradables

model, similar to that used in Rebelo and Végh (1995). This will establish a
benchmark against which we can compare the model with distribution that we
study later.
Consider a small open economy with no barriers to the flow of tradable goods,
so that purchasing power parity holds for this good:

pT_5pT*

(3.1)

PT and PtT* denote the domestic and foreign price of the tradable good,
respectively. The exchange rate, defined as units of domestic currency per unit of
Here

foreign currency, is denoted by St.
The Household's Problem

The representative household seeks to maximize lifetime utility (U) defined
over sequences of consumption of tradable (CT) and non-tradable goods (CITT):

(3.2)

where $ is the discount factor and a is the inverse of thefl intertemporal elasticity
of substitution. Each agent supplies inelastically N units of time per period which
are allocated between the tradables (NT) and non-tradables (NNT) sectors:

NT+NNTN

(3.3)

Households also supply capital to the tradable (Kr) and non-tradable (K[TT)
sectors. For most of our analysis we assume that capital (K.1) can be freely
reallocated across these sectors:
13

(3.4)

The law of motion for the aggregate capital stock is:

Kt=4+(1—b)Kt_a.

(3.5)

We abstract from adjustment costs in capital accumulation, which are a standard element in small open economy models, for two reasons. First, to study the
magnitude of RER movements that can be generated by the model, it is sufficient to measure the impact effect (which occurs in the first period, when the
stock of capital is fixed) and the steady state effect (which immediately occurs
in the second period). Adjustment costs smooth out the steady state effect over
time.'3 Second, we later introduce additional features into the model—investment

irreversibility, immobility of capitalacross sectors and a construction sector—that

produce a smooth adjustment towards the steady state. This allows us to evaluate
how much these features in isolation contribute to generating realistic investment
dynamics.
In addition to accumulating physical capital, households can borrow and lend

in the international capital market at rate r. Their net foreign asset holdings in
the beginning of period t are denoted by b_,. To abstract from the presence of
trends in the current account, we assume that
(1 + r)'. The household's
intertemporal budget constraint is:

W1N+QtKj, +PtT(7rT+7rtT+1lt)+stbt.l(1+r)

(3.6)

'3Adjustrnent costs also reduce somewhat the movement in the RER that the model generates.
The fact that investment is costly to adjust reduces the wealth effect and hence the expansion
in the consumption of non-tradables that underlies the RER movements. Since this effect is
symmetric in the model with and without distribution costs, the absence of adjustment costs
does not bias our comparisons.

Total consumption measured in units of the tradable good is given by

C = C1' +pC7T,

(3.8)

where Pt is the relative price of non-tradables:

Pt = pNT/pT

(3.9)

We assume that the function v(.) has the following quadratic form:

v(X) =X2—X+1/4,
where

.

(3.10)

X = M/[PT(C + I)} is the inverse of the velocity of circulation with

respect to total expenditure. This quadratic form, borrowed from Vdgh (1989),
15

ensures that transactions costs are zero when the nominal interest rate is zero.
When R = 0 it is optimal to set X to 1/2 and v(1/2) = 0. Ncte that for X < 1/2,

the function v(X) is decreasing in X. This means that increasing the amount
of money held by the households while keeping total consumption, C, constant,
reduces the transactions costs Z.
The household's problem then consists of maximizing lifetime utility, defined

in (3.2), subject to the constraints (3.3)-(3.10).
The Firms' Problem

Production of tradables (YT) and non-tradablds (Y/1T) are described by the
following Cobb-Douglas production functions, where AT and ANT are time-invariant
level parameters:14

The variable T denotes the fixed stock of land in the economy.'5 The tradable
good YT can be used for investment or consumption, while the non-tradable good

can only be consumed.

Firms hire labor and capital from households to maximize their profits, measured in units of the tradable good:
'4To improve the model's implications for the behavior of the real exchange rate, Rebelo and
Végh (1995) assume that the production of non-tradables does not require capital.
'5Our model abstracts from housing; all land is used in the non-tradables sector for production
and distribution. However, as Erceg and Levin (1996) stress, housing costs can have a very
significant direct impact on the CPI. In the case of Argentina, the cost of residential housing
rose by 122% between March 1991 and March 1993. This large increase had, however, a relatively

small impact on the CPI because rents have a surprisingly low weight in the index (2.3%, see
Table 1). This is probably due to the fact that housing services consumed by home owners are
not imputed as rents.

The Government
We consider two cases. In the first, the government rebates the seignorage revenue to the households through lump sum transfers: In the second case, seignorage

revenue is used to finance government spending that does not affect private utility

to:

Sit = Stft_i(1 + r) + Mf — M1 —
The no-Ponzi game condition for the government is:

(3.13)

ft/(1 +r)t = 0. Together

these two equations define the government's present value budget constraint.
Monetary Policy
Since we are interested in fixed exchange rate regimes we model the rate of

devaluation s as the exogenous policy parameter that the government controls.

The level of M will be endogenously determined by money demand. We will
study the exchange—rate-based stabilization experiment that is conventional in
the literature. We start the economy in a steady state with e > 0 and study the
impact of an unanticipated reduction in c to zero.

The Real Exchange Rate

In order to compare the implications of the model with the data it is important

to note that the RER does not coincide with the relative price of non-tradables.
The geometric consumer price index for this economy is:

Pt =

to simplify, we assumed the CPI weights are the same in the two countries.'7 This has no consequences since we will assume that the foreign relative

price of non-tradables, p = PT*/PIVT*, is constant over time. This assumption,
together with (3.9), allows us to re-write the RER as:
RER

=

SPT*( *\1—7

=

( *'jl7
(3.18)

Pt

It is standard in the literature to equate the RER with the relative price of non-

tradables. Since 'y < 1 the movements in the RER reported in the literature
would be even smaller, if they were computed according to (3.17).

4. Introducing Distribution Services
We now introduce a distribution sector to our basic model by assuming that
tradable goods need to be combined with distribution services before they are
consumed. To avoid complicating the analysis we abstract from the presence of
distribution services in the non-tradables sector. We also aggregate the production

of non-tradables and distribution services into a single sector. Preferences are the
same as before and the only modification to the technology is:

+

=

{ [ANT KT?_n (N7T)j

+ (1 —

v)T(1+P)/P},

where

is the amount of distribution services required to sell one unit of consumption. This formulation of the distribution sector is identical to that used by
Erceg and Levin (1996).

To compute the exchange rate for this economy it is useful to define the pro-

ducers price of the traded good as PT in the domestic economy and as PCT* in

the foreign country. Note that households cannot purchase the tradable good at
these prices, they pay retail prices which are given by:

pT =
pT*

= pT* +

(3.17) we can write the RER as:

PrTy(P[T)'

It is useful to define Pt. = pNT/PT and p = PNT*/PT*. These are the relative
price of non-tradables in terms of tradables exclusive of distribution services in
each of the two countries. We can then re-write the RER as:
—
RER—

S T*(1

' 'I'Pt)

PT(1+c5pt)7ptl_7

Here we assume that PPP holds for producer prices of tradable goods:'8

gpT. = pT

.

(4.1)

Equation (4.1) together with the assumption that p is constant over time, implies
that the real exchange rate is given by:

RER= (1+p*)7(p*)lT

(1+Øpt)p

(4.2)

This formula shows that the introduction of distribution in the standard model
can potentially magnify the movements in the RER. A given movement in Pt
has a larger effect on the RER when > 0 than when 0 = 0. However, since

Pt is determined in equilibrium, this formula alone cannot tell us whether the
model with distribution produces larger RER movements. It is possible that
in the model with distribution movements in p will be small, leading to smaller
movements in the RER than the basic model.
Note that not all forms of distribution costs necessarily magnify movements in

the real exchange rate. Suppose, for example, that to distribute one tradable good
'8There is some evidence that this weak form of PPP may hold in practice. One reason why
PPP holds for gold contracts is that these do not include delivery of the gold. In other words,
the price of gold quoted in exchanges is exclusive of delivery services.
20

requires units of tradables. Under this 'iceberg cost' assumption often used in
the trade literature, the retail price of tradable goods is given by PT = pT(i + ),
and

pT* = T*(i + ç). It is easy to see that using these equations in (3.17) we

obtain the same formula for the RER as in the economy without distribution
costs (equation (3.18)).

5. Calibrating the Models
To conduct our experiments we calibrate the model to replicate the average values

of some key ratios for the Argentine economy in the decade prior to the 1991
Convertibility Plan. Each time interval represents one quarter. All numerical
results were computed using a shooting numerical routine.'9

Our baseline parameters are summarized in Table 11. We used the same rate

of inflation for the pre-stabilization period as Uribe (1997) in his study of the

Convertibility Plan: 25% per month, which is equivalent to 95% per quarter.
The value of a corresponds to the estimate of the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution obtained by Reinhart and Végh (1995) for Argentina. We chose so
that 50% of consumption expenditures were devoted to non-tradable goods.
We chose AT and ANTt0 be identical and set their value so as to generate play,-

sible capital-labor ratios in the two sectors. The stock of land, T, was chosen so
that the relative price of non-tradables is equal to one in the initial no-stabilization

steady state. Neither of these parameters influence the change in the RER that
'91n the models where the transition to the steady state occurs in one period we solved
the model using simple shooting. This technique no longer worked in the case of a temporary
stabilization or in the models with a construction sector or irreversible investment. In these cases
we solved the model using a two stage algorithm. In the first stage we searched for solutions
such that the economy converged to a steady state in T periods, where T was a small number.
We obtained these T period solutions for a smooth sequence of es, starting with the value of
e in the pre-stabilization steady state (95%) until e = 0. In the second stage we started with
the solution for e = U and increased T until the constraint that the system must reach a steady
state in T periods was no longer binding.
21

occurs in response to a stabilization; they simply control the level of different
variables.

We chose the transactions technology parameter As to match the 7% ratio of
seignorage to GDP estimated by Kiguel (1989) for the period 1984-87. The level
of net foreign assets, a, was chosen so as to generate a steady state trade balance

to GDP ratio that coincides with the long run average for this variable in the
period 1970-1990 (2.7%).

In the model with distribution we set 4) to 1. This implies that half of the
retail price is accounted for by distribution services. In the basic model, 4) is set
equal to zero.

Table 9, constructed with input-output data, depicts the labor share in value
added for different US industries. Table 10 depicts the sectoral labor shares for

Argentina that we use to calibrate the model. These shares are very sensitive
to whether we treat "mixed income," (an income category similar to proprietors
income in US data) as labor or capital compensation. The shares in Table 10 were
computed by eliminating mixed income from total income.

We set the labor share in the tradablesector (a) to 41%, which is the average

labor share in the non-service sector in Argentina. The parameters ii and

r

were chosen so that in our baseline parameterization, the labor share in the nontradable sector coincides with our estimates for the share of labor in the Argentine

service sector (50%). Our parameter choices resulted in a share of land income in

total income of 9% in the initial steady state of the baseline model. While this
value strikes us as reasonable, it is difficult to compare with empirical evidence
because land income is often included in profits.

Unfortunately, we could not findany empirical studies to guide our choice for
p, the elasticity of substitution between labor and land. To overcome this problem

we tried to choose a reasonable value for our baseline calibration (-1/3) and then

studied the behavior of the RER in the two models for different values of p (see
Table 14).

to define w=Compensation of employees in sector i and V=Value Added - Indirect Business

[=1(w/¾)I/n. The weighted average was computed as (Lt4 w1)/(1 4). The labor

While we view our baseline parametrization as a plausible benchmark, there
is substantial uncertainty about individual parameter values. For this reason we

ran numerous experiments to test the sensitivity of the model. While we only
report a subset of this information to conserve on space, in all of our results, the
model with distribution did remarkably better than the basic model in terms of
its implications for the behavior of the RER, while producing equally plausible
results for the other variables.
Since our goal is to improve the model's implications for the magnitude of
changes in the RER we will confine ourselves to two simple experiments: a permanent and a temporary stabilization. It is clear that reality falls somewhat
24

between these two extreme examples. Agents do not know whether the stabiliza-

tion will continue, and this uncertainty may be important in explaining certain
features, such as the gradual rise of the RER after the onset of stabilization (see
Mendoza and Uribe (1999)).

6. A Permanent Stabilization
In period 0 the economy is in the no-stabilization steady state where the quarterly
rate of devaluation, E, is 95%. In period 1 there is an unanticipated stabilization

that permanently reduces e to zero. Since there are no adjustment costs, the
economy reaches a new steady state in period 2. In the experiments reported, we
rebate the seignorage revenues to the private sector.

Table 12 describes the response of the different variables to a permanent sta-

bilization in our benchmark model. Table 13 describes the analogue results for
the model with distribution.
The economic mechanisms at work in these tables are well-know and thus can

be summarized briefly. The permanent decline in inflation reduces the transactions costs associated with consumption and investment purchases and leads to
a re-monetization of the economy. The reduction in the effective price of investment generates an investment boom. This is in large part financed by foreign

borrowing, creating a current account deficit. The wealth effect caused by the
inflation reduction leads to an expansion in consumption?2 Since non-tradable
consumption has to be produced locally, in the first period of the reform capital
22When the seignorage revenue is not rebated the wealth effect associated with reducing
inflation is larger, making the movements in the HER slightly larger. When seignorage revenues

are not rebated the RER appreciates by 11.4% in the experiment described in Table 10 and
27.4% in the experiment in Table 11. For an evaluation of the impact of rebating seignorage
see Mendoza and Uribe (1999). In their experiments, which involve the Mexico 1987-1994
temporary stabilization, rebating the seignorage revenue reduces the rise in the relative price of
non-tradables from 5% to 17%.

25

and labor are reallocated toward the non-tradable sector, leading to a recession
in tradables production. In the new steady state the capital stock increase allows

the production of both sectors to be higher than in the pre-stabilization steady
state, Since non-tradables production requires land, the land price rises.

There are four areas in which the model with distribution performs better
than the basic model. First, the model with distribution produces a much larger
RER appreciation—the RER declines by 8.5% in the basic model and by 19%
in the model with distribution. To show that this is a generic feature of our
environment we report in Table 14 the RER movements for various combinations

of the elasticity of substitution between land and value added in non-tradables
production (p), and the fraction of the retail price accounted for by distribution.23
231n all these experiments As was adjusted so that seignorage was 7% of GDP in the pre-

27

The last row of this table provides an upper bound on the RER appreciation in
the context of our experiment. This pertains to the case where the production of
non-tradables is constant since it is Leontief in land and the stock of land is fixed.

In the model without distribution, it is virtually impossible to generate a RER
appreciation of more than 12%. In contrast, in the model with distribution there
are several plausible combinations of parameters that produce realistic movements

in the RER.

Second, the model with distribution has more realistic implications for the
sources of RER fluctuations. In the basic model all of the movement in the

RER is caused by changes in the relative price of non-tradables. In cont±ast,
Section 2 provides evidence that in the Argentine data, only 1% of the 25% RER
appreciation is accounted for by changes in the relative price of non-tradables. In

the distribution model the RER falls by 19%, with 13% of this change explained
by chances in the retail price of tradables and only 6% explained by the changes
in the price of non-tradables.

Third, the model is consistent with the differences between the CPI-based
RER and the PPI-based RER (see panel 1 and 2 of Figure 1). While the CPIbased RER appreciated by 25.3% in the first two years of the stabilization plan,
stabilization steady state. The pre-stabilization level of a was also adjusted to be consistent
with a trade balance of 2.7%.

28

the WPI-based RE1-? appreciated only by 2.7%. By April 1996 the total depreciation relative to April 1991 of the CPI-based exchange rate was 28%, compared
with only 10% for the PPI-based RER. In the model the RER appreciation of

the CPI based index is also much more pronounced than the movement in the
WPI-based RER (19% versus 9%).24

Fourth, an inherent feature of the basic model is that large RER appreciations come at the expense of implausible declines in the tradable-non-tradable
consumption mix (CNT/CT). Large appreciations also tend to generate a counterfactual fall in the consumption of non-tradables. Both of these problems are
avoided in the model with distribution because the relative price of non-tradables

in terms of the retail price of tradables (p/(l + pt)) increases by less that Pt.
Since consuming tradable goods requires the use of non-tradable distribution ser-

vices, when the price of non-tradables rises there is less scope for substituting
toward tradable consumption.
Can we replicate the results of the model with distribution simply by reducing

'y in the basic model? The answer is no. In our calibration of the distribution
model, half of the price of tradable goods is accounted for by distribution services.

Since tradable consumption represents half of total consumption expenditure, this

means that the non-tradable component of consumption is 75% (50% devoted to
purchasing non-traded goods and 25% to distribution services associated with the

consumption of traded goods). Thus we set #y to 0.25. This re-parameterization

does succeed in generating ,a higher RER appreciation (15%). However, this
comes at cost of changes in tradable-non-tradable consumption mix that are even
less realistic than in the model with = 0.5.
24We computed the wholesale price index for Argentina as (1+'°pt). Note that the onlynontradable components in this index are the wholesale distribution costs. Since Table 7 suggests
that value added is similar in retail and wholesale, we set = 0.5. This choice is likely to bias
the results against us since it probably includes too much distribution costs in the WPI, making
it more similar to the CPI than in the data.
29

If we abstract from differences in the CPI weights in the two countries, we
can think of movements in the RER as involving two components. (see equation

(2.1) with 'y = 7Ar).25 The first component, which we denote by RERT, is the
change in the relative retail price of tradable goods in the two countries. The
second component, which we denote by RERNT, is the relative, relative price of

non-traded goods in terms of the producer price of tradables. In our model these
components can be written as:

Note that the movements in RERT and RERNT have a single source, which is
changes in the relative price of non-tradables with respect to producer prices (Pt).

This makes the movements in RERT generated by the model closely related to
movements in RERNT. The last two panels of Figure 1 depict the logarithm of
RERT and RERNT. Both RERT and RERNT were normalized to be one in
April 1991. These series share a similar trend. The variable RERT tracks closely

the evolution of RER. In contrast movements in RERNT are much smaller in
magnitude and display some high frequency movements that are not captured by
our simple model.26 These movements could reflect, for instance, nominal rigidi-

ties and pricing to market which invalidate the equation SJT* = T, and/or the
presence of distribution costs that are not related to the price of non-tradables.27
25We thank Charles Engel for suggesting these calculations to us.
26The raw correlation between RERT and RERNT is 0.84, which reflects the fact that the
trend component of the two series is similar. In contrast the correlation between the cyclical
component of both series (extracted with the Hodrick-Prescott filter) is -0.58.
27Engel (2000) argues that the correlation between distribution costs and.the relative price of
non-tradables has to be low in order to explain movements in the Mexico-US RER.

30

6.1. On the Accuracy of Linearization Methods
Since linearizations are often used to study the effects of stabilization in models

similar to the ones we study, it is useful to evaluate their performance against
the results of our simple shooting method. Table 15 shows the movements in the
RER produced by both numerical methods.
Table 15
Effect of Permanent Stabilization on RER (%)
Linearized Non-Linearized
Basic Model
-5.0%
-8.5%

Model with Distribution -10.2%

-19.0%

Linearization methods are unusually inaccurate in terms of their implications

for the behavior of the RER. This is not surprising for two reasons. First we are

studying a large shock that takes the economy far from its initial steady state.
Second, this shock has permanent effects and the economy never returns to the
initial steady state.

6.2. Investment Irreversibility and Capital Immobility
In the previous model, employment in tradables falls in the aftermath of a stabilization. Since in the basic model capital is mobile across sectors, the capital from

tradables is reallocated to the non-tradable sector, thus dampening movements
in the real exchange rate. Making capital immobile and investment irreversible
shuts down this channel of reallocation and magnifies the movements in the real
exchange rate.28 We now consider a model with both of these features. This requires modifying the model by eliminating equation (3.4) and replacing equation
(3.5) with:

= jT + (1 — 8)Ki1,

(6.1)

28An alternative pursued in the literature that has some of the same effects is to introduce
adjustment costs to investment in both tradables and non-tradables.

We also need to define total investment, which enters the household's budget
constraint, (3.6), and equilibrium condition (3.14), as:

r_rT rNT
1t—1t
+-'t
In the experiment described in Table 16 investment irreversibilities are not
binding once sectoral capital immobility is imposed. Sectoral immobility is bind-

ing in period 2; the economy would like to reallocate capital from the tradable to

the non-tradable sector in this period. Table 16 shows that sectoral immobility
substantially enhances the effect of stabilization on the RER in the period when
the shock takes place. In the model with distribution, sectoral capital immobility

6.3. Incorporating a Construction Sector
According to the 1992 US Input-Output matrix, roughly half of investment emanates from the construction sector. In the 1997 Input-Output table for Argentina,
construction accounts for 63% of investment purchases. Thus, construction, which

is a non-tradable good, is an important component of investment. In this subsection we introduce a construction sector into our model. This will provide a natural

source of adjustment costs and will lead the economy to converge slowly toward
32

the new steady state, We assume that to install one unit of capital requires one
unit of the tradable good and 4! units of construction. The construction sector
combines labor (N?) and capital (Kf) according to a Cobb-Douglas production
function. The production structure of the model is characterized by the following
equations, together with equations (3.11), (6.1), (6.2), and (6.3).

I = IT+I7T+I
There is substantial uncertainty about the share of labor in the Argentine construction sector. "Mixed income" (which is the analogue of proprietors income in
the US) represents roughly 30% of total value added in this sector. Since in the

US the construction labor share is 78%, we uspect that most "mixed income"
in construction is in fact labor income. Thus, we used a high value for the labor
share (p = 66%) consistent with this hypothesis.
Since our model abstracts from residential investment we estimate the share
of non-residential investment accounted for by construction. We adopted a value
of p1 such that 25% of investment is produced by the construction sector.29

We maintain the assumptions that investment is irreversible and immobile

across sectors. Without these assumptions capital would be reallocated in the
29This is a rough' estimate based on the following calculations. We assumed that construction
is 100% of residential investment. Based on data for Mexico (we could not find comparable
information for Argentina) we assumed that residential investment is 50% of total investment.
Together with the fact that construction represents 63% of investment in Argentina this implies
that the share of non-residential investment accounted for by construction is roughly 25%.

period when the stabilization takes place, from the tradables and non-tradables
sector. to construction. Table 17, which summarizes the RER implications of
different models, shows that this would significantly reduce the change in the
RER produced by the model in the period where the shock takes place: from
-25.5% to -17.3%.

Figure 2 depicts the effect of a permanent stabilization. All the variables are

expressed as percentage deviations from the initial steady state. As in our prior
experiments, the decline in the rate of inflation reduces the costs of investment
and creates an investment boom. Since construction is required for investment,
both labor and capital are re-allocated toward construction in the initial periods
after the shock. This leads to a sharper decline in the output of the tradable sector
than in a model without construction. The irreversibility constraint on capital is

binding in the tradable sector during the first 6 periods since during this time,
the economy would like to reallocate capital to the construction sector to invest
at a faster rate.

This version of the model captures the important boom-recession cycle in
construction that tends to take place during exchange-rate-based stabilization
episodes. Table 17 shows that the incorporation of construction leads to a higher
RER appreciation during the transition to the steady state, but to a lower steady
state effect than the model with distribution and no construction: This reduction
in the magnitude of the RER's steady state response is driven by the fact that the

introduction of the construction sector increase the cost of investing and reduce
the wealth effect associated with the stabilization.

7. A Temporary Stabilization
The fact that most stabilizations fail has led economists to study the effects of
stabilizations that are temporary (see e.g. Calvo and Végh (1993)). In this section

we compare the implications of the model, with and without a distribution sector
for a stabilization that is known to last for only T = 10 periods. We assume that

investment is irreversible. Without this friction these models produce degenerate

results. In period T, as inflation rises to its previous level the effective price of

investing increases dramatically. Thus agents will attempt to invest sharply in
period T — 1 and then disinvest in period T. In our experiment this constraint
binds for 38 periods after the end the stabilization.
Figure 3 shows the dynamics of the model with distribution. The dynamics of

the basic model are similar, but the movements in the RER are more attenuated.
Table 18 compares the behavior of the RER in the two models.

At time 1, the first period of the exchange-rate-based stabilization, consumption of both tradables and non-tradables rises for two reasons. First there is the
wealth effect associated with the stabilization. Second, the effective price of con-

sumption is low during the stabilization period but will become high again after
period 10. This leads to intertemporal substitution in consumption which con-

tributes to the boom. The economy reallocates labor towards the non-tradable
sector in period 1, in order to increase consumption of non-tradables and to provide the distribution services needed to consume more tradables. As a result, the

production of tradables falls at time 1.

The decline in the effective price associated with the reduction in inflation
leads to an investment boom which is financed mostly by borrowing from abroad,

leading to large current account deficits. The investment response is particularly acute in period 10 when the change in its effective price is imminent. This
large investment flow raises the capital stock in the tradable sector in period 11.
Since tradables are capital intensive, this leads to a rise in the relative price of
non-tradables and to an appreciation of the RER. In the following periods the
irreversibility constraint on investment is binding and the capital stock falls at
the rate of depreciation, leading to a smooth decline in the RER.

8. Conclusion
Economists often mention distribution costs as one of the reasons why purchasing power parity fails. Distribution services are intensive in labor and land and

thus introduce a natural wedge between the price of the same good in different
countries. However, distributing costs are often thought to be too small to be

an important determinant of the RER. In this paper we gather evidence that
suggests that the fraction of the retail price accounted for by distribution costs
is large: roughly 50% for the average consumption good and as high as 80% for
36

some goods. This evidence lead us to study the RER implications of a model that

incorporates a simple distribution sector. Since there is a large literature on the

behavior of the RER during exchange-rate-based stabilizations, these episodes
provide a natural road test for our theory. We thus calibrate our model to the Argentine 1991 Convertibility plan and study its implications for the RER. While
incorporating a distribution sector in the standard model is technically trivial,
this small extension of the standard model improves its performance significantly.

The model with distribution can produce large RER movements without generat-

ing a fall in non-tradable consumption or unrealistically pronounced movements

in the price of non-tradable goods relative to the retail price of tradables and in
distribution margins.

We study several more complex variants of the distribution model. We first
consider the effects of investment irreversibilities and sectoral immobility in the
stock of capital. This enhances the RER appreciations that the model is capable

of producing in the transition to the steady state. Then, motivated by the fact a
substantial part of investment is supplied by the construction sector, we explore
the effects of introducing a construction sector whose output is required to install

new capital. This produces a smooth adjustment of the economy toward the
steady state and a realistic boom-recession cydle in the construction sector.
While we focus on the behavior of the RER during exchange-rate-based sta-

bilizations, the model, with distribution may be useful in studying the behavior
of the RER in other contexts. One such context is Cordoba and Kehoe's (1999)
study of the Spanish capital flow liberalization, which finds that the magnitude of

the RER appreciation is difficult to rationalize on the basis of their model. Another context is Engel's (1999) empirical investigation of the behavior of the US

RER. Engel finds that the relative price of non-tradables does not seem to vary
enough to explain a significant fraction of the observed RER variability. A model
37

with a distribution sector can easily generate larger fluctuations in the RER than
in the relative price of non-tradables.

We suspect that incorporating a distribution sector may also contribute to
the explanation of several outstanding puzzles in international macroeconomics,

namely the fact that the cross country correlation of output is higher than that
of consUmption (see Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1995) and Bater (1995)) and
the fact that consumption is too smooth in a small open economy with standard
preferences (see Correia, Neves and Rebelo (1995)). Work on the role that distribution may play in these puzzles would greatly benefit from more information on

the behavior of distribution margins across different countries and over time.
