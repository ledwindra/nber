Between\n1959 and 1979 the income available to children tended to follow the same\npattern as adult income, but between 1979 and 1984 the trends for children\nwere very unfavorable. Poverty rose, average income fell, and income\ninequality increased. Contrary to popular belief, the increase in femaleheaded\nhouseholds played only a small part in the growth of poverty among\nchildren since 1979. Income available to children fell because households\nwith children are highly dependent on labor income- -which fell for all age\ngroups. The elderly (65+), who derive 75 percent of their income from\nnonlabor sources (e.g., social security, private pensions, interest), were\nthe only age group to experience gains in real per capita income during\n1979-84. The conclusions about trends in the money income available to\nchildren and adults are relatively unchanged when estimates of the value of\nnonmarket production and in-kind government social welfare programs are\nadded to money income.\n\n",
