    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a unique dataset, the first-ever of its kind, by leveraging the US Census Bureau\u2019s LEHD program and various big textual data sources, to examine the factors influencing the compensation and career trajectories of US active equity mutual fund managers. We find that managers\u2019 compensation is primarily determined by assets under management (AUM), with return performance directly influencing bonuses beyond its impact on AUM. Despite not aligning with client interests, fund flows significantly affect manager compensation and career outcomes. Large fund outflows increase a manager\u2019s likelihood of job turnover (with a substantial decline in compensation) by 4 percentage points.\n\n",
