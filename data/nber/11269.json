We develop a \"protection for sale\"  theoretical framework consistent with the data, by explicitly allowing for non-tariff barriers. Introducing partial rent capturing we obtain a testable specification which finds support in the data. Our results suggest that average rent capturing is in the order of 72-75 percent.\n\n",
