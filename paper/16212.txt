ABSTRACT
Social Security is widely believed to protect its recipients from inflation because benefits are indexed
to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). However, the
CPI-W may not accurately reflect the experience of retirees for two reasons. First, retirees generally
have higher medical expenses than workers, and medical costs, in recent years, have tended to rise
faster than the prices of other goods. Second, even if medical costs did not rise faster than the prices
of other goods, as retirees aged, their medical spending would still tend to increase as a share of income;
that is, each cohort of retirees would still see a decline in the real income available for non-medical
spending. We show that, for the 1918 birth cohort, Social Security benefits net of average out-of-pocket
medical expenses have declined relative to a price index for non-medical goods by around 20 percent
for men, and by around 27 percent for women. We explore alternative options for indexing Social
Security benefits and discuss the impact of these alternatives on Social Security’s long-term finances.

I. INTRODUCTION
Social Security is widely believed to protect its recipients from a number of risks,
including uncertainty regarding length of life and inflation, due to the inflation-indexed life
annuity form of the benefit. The inflation protection comes from the fact that Social Security
benefits are indexed to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers
(CPI-W). The CPI-W is based on the spending patterns of a broad group of workers, representing
approximately 32 percent of the U.S. population. However, the CPI-W may not accurately reflect
the experience of retirees for two reasons. First, retirees generally have higher medical expenses
than workers, and medical costs, in recent years, have tended to rise faster than the prices of
other goods. Second, even if medical costs did not rise faster than the prices of other goods,
individual retirees would still, on average, need to devote a larger share of income to medical
spending as they age. This means that individual retirees would still see a decline in the real
income they have available for non-medical spending. In this paper, we explore both of these
factors, quantify the extent to which they undermine the inflation protection provided by the
indexation of Social Security benefits, and explore the implications of alternative methods of
indexing benefits.
Our analysis is related to the literature on cost-of-living indices for the elderly. Most
recently, Burdick and Fisher (2007) and Stewart (2008) compare the CPI-W to the CPI-E, an
experimental consumer price index based on the spending patterns of the elderly, produced but
not published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Since the CPI-E is intended to reflect the
experience of Americans aged 62 and older, the main difference between the CPI-E and the CPIW is in the weights for the various expenditure categories. The CPI-E has increased faster than
the CPI-W over the past twenty years, due primarily to the relative rise in health care costs, and

1

the fact that the elderly spend more on health care than the nonelderly, even after taking into
account the availability of Medicare. Hobijn and Lagakos (2003) suggest that if Social Security
benefits were indexed to the CPI-E instead of the CPI-W, the Trust Fund depletion date would be
moved forward by about five years. This result demonstrates that there are important differences
between the two indices, and that the choice between them is consequential. Other relevant
research includes Boskin and Hurd (1982), who compute separate price indices for elderly and
nonelderly households even before the CPI-E was constructed, and List (2005), who reviews the
issues regarding cost-of-living indices for the elderly, but without as much of a focus on health
care spending.
In carrying out our analysis, we examine two major components of medical costs. First,
most Social Security recipients are also participants in Medicare Part B. The monthly premiums
for Part B, which recently became means-tested, go up with the increasing costs of health
insurance as they account for approximately 25 percent of the cost of providing benefits. These
premiums are automatically deducted from Social Security retirement benefits and have
increased much faster than Social Security benefits. The dramatic difference in growth rates is
shown in Figure 1, which illustrates that the monthly premium of Part B has gone up
approximately 1,600 percent between 1975 and 2011 (i.e., the amount is 17 times higher than it
was), while the automatic cost-of-living adjustments have accumulated to just over 300 percent.
Moreover, with means-adjusted Part B premiums introduced in 2007, very high-income
individuals (with modified adjusted gross income of more than $214,000 in 2011) saw their
Medicare Part B monthly premiums go from $45.50 in 2000 to $369.10 in 2011. The increase for
these very high-income people clearly eroded the real value of their monthly Social Security
benefit. Second, retirees often have substantial out-of-pocket medical expenses, including

2

Medicare deductibles and co-payments, and payments for services with limited Medicare
coverage, such as nursing home care.
We show that, after subtracting both of these components of health spending from Social
Security benefits, available income net of medical expenses for a Social Security participant with
average out-of-pocket medical spending has, in fact, been increasing more slowly than a price
index of non-medical goods and services. For example, the average man born in 1918 has seen
his monthly Social Security benefit, net of medical expenses, rise from $527.85 at the end of
1983 (when he was 65) to $866.80 at the end of 2007 (when he was 89). However, if his net-ofmedical-expenses benefit had kept pace with inflation in the prices of non-medical goods over
that time period, he would have had $1,086.13 per month in 2007 after medical expenses. That
is, his net-of-medical-spending benefit has declined by around 20 percent, relative to the nonmedical goods price index. Similarly, the average woman born in 1918 has seen her net-ofmedical-expenses benefit decline by around 27 percent relative to the non-medical goods price
index. Of course, these results assume no other income besides Social Security, but a sizeable
fraction of the elderly depend on Social Security for the majority of their income: 64 percent of
beneficiaries rely on Social Security for 50 percent or more of their income, and 34 percent of
beneficiaries rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more of their income.1
We also show that if Social Security benefits had been indexed to the CPI-E instead of
the CPI-W, men born in 1918 would have $961.20 net of medical expenses, falling only 11.5
percent short of the $1,086.13 needed to hold non-medical expenditures constant in real terms;
similarly, women born in 1918 would fall only 18.1 percent short. The reason indexing to the
CPI-E does not fully compensate retirees for inflation is that, even if medical costs remained

constant over time for the elderly, they tend to spend more on out-of-pocket medical expenses as
they age, crowding out non-medical spending. Thus, each cohort’s Social Security benefit net of
average out-of-pocket medical spending would tend to decline in real terms even if the price of
medical care rose at the same rate as the prices of other goods, or alternatively, even if the
average retiree’s real net Social Security benefit remained constant.
Both the CPI-W and CPI-E are subject to the usual criticisms of consumer price indices.
In particular, neither accounts adequately for technological progress or for consumer substitution
among goods. The CPI-E is subject to additional criticisms, including the fact that it overlooks
senior citizen discounts and differences in the retail shopping patterns of the elderly, and is based
on a relatively small sample.2 The failure to account properly for technological progress can be
quite serious when it comes to health care. Higher medical costs may reflect the consumption of
better quality medical care, and retirees may be better off even if they are left with less to spend
on other non-medical goods. Therefore, we emphasize that we cannot draw any conclusions
about changes in the utility of Social Security recipients from this analysis. All we show is that
Social Security benefits may not be fully inflation-indexed in the sense that recipients with
average out-of-pocket medical spending cannot, from one year to the next, purchase the same
bundle of non-medical goods with their Social Security benefits.
Our methodology and results are described in more detail in Sections II and III. Section IV
discusses the policy implications of changing the method of indexation, and Section V offers
concluding remarks.
II. METHODOLOGY
Our analysis proceeds in several steps. First, we estimate a model to predict average outof-pocket medical spending as a function of age, gender, and race. Second, we estimate average

Social Security benefits broken down by age, gender, and race. Third, we subtract Medicare Part
B premiums, as well as our estimates of average out-of-pocket medical expenses, from these
average benefits. Finally, we compare the rate of increase in the remaining amount (non-medical
spending) to the CPI-E for all items less medical expenses. Each of these steps is detailed below.
A. Out-of-Pocket Spending
We use Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data from 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002,
2004, and 2006 to model the age profile of out-of-pocket medical expenses.3 Our analysis is
limited to these years because the definition of out-of-pocket expenses is relatively consistent
across interviews starting in 1995. The sample includes all individuals aged 65–89. The HRS
collects data on a wide range of out-of-pocket medical expenses including payments for doctor
and dentist visits, hospital and nursing home stays, outpatient surgery, prescription drugs, home
health care, and special facilities. Respondents are asked about their total out-of-pocket spending
over the two years prior to the interview; we divide this amount by 24 to arrive at monthly outof-pocket spending. One shortcoming of the HRS data is that it does not include health insurance
premiums in out-of-pocket medical expenses, including those for Medicare Part B. Later in the
analysis, we add Part B premiums to predicted out-of-pocket expenditures.
We regress monthly total out-of-pocket spending (the sum of all the components listed
above) on a variety of demographic variables, including age, age-squared, gender, and race
(white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, or other race). The results from our three basic
specifications are shown in Table 1.4 Specification 1 does not include any controls for race, but
allows the level and shape of the age profile of spending to vary by gender by including a gender

Other studies use the log of medical expenses as the dependent variable (e.g., French and Jones, 2004). Although
we also estimated regressions using the log of out-of-pocket spending as our dependent variable, we prefer the linear
specifications because, when aggregated, they produce results that most closely match the actual aggregate values of
out-of-pocket spending. The semi-log regression results are available from the authors upon request.

dummy interacted with the age variables. Specification 2 adds race dummies, allowing the level,
but not the shape, of the age profile to vary by race. Specification 3 includes a full set of
interactions among race, age, and gender, allowing each race-gender combination to have a
different level and shape. All specifications include a set of year dummies, which allow the age
profiles to shift (generally upwards) over time.
We use specification 1 to construct a preliminary age profile of out-of-pocket spending
for men and women aged 65–84 in each year from 1983–2007. Predicted values for years not
covered by our HRS data are assigned the intercept for the closest year in the HRS; for example,
1985 is given the intercept for 1995 (the earliest year in our HRS sample), and 1997 is given the
intercept for 1996. Clearly we would expect our predicted profiles to be more accurate for the
years covered by the HRS data. However, as long as the predicted relative values of spending for
the age-gender groups are accurate, we can scale the levels to match the overall level of out-ofpocket expenditures. We do this by aggregating our predicted values using population counts for
men and women of each age group, and then dividing actual aggregate expenditures for the 65–
84 age group in each year by our predicted aggregate expenditures.5 These ratios of actual to
predicted aggregate expenditures are our “scaling factors.” We then multiply our preliminary
predicted age profiles by the scaling factor for the appropriate year. Figure 2 shows the predicted
and actual aggregate expenditures for the 65–84 age group, as well as the scaling factors for each
year. The scaling factors are quite close to 1 for most of the years covered by the HRS data.

5

Population counts were obtained by request from the Social Security Administration, and actual aggregate
expenditures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, National Health Expenditure Data,
https://www.cms.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/. Aggregate out-of-pocket expenditures by age are reported for
years 1987, 1996, 1999, 2002, and 2004. To impute out-of-pocket expenditures for additional years, the 2004 values
were adjusted by the rate of growth of aggregate out-of-pocket payments for all ages. This procedure yielded values
that closely match the actual values in the years where expenditures by age were reported.

6

For example, actual aggregate expenditures in 2006 were 1.06 times the aggregate
amount predicted by our regression model for 2006. Our model also predicts that a 70-year-old
male has average out-of-pocket expenses of $125.64 per month in 2006. We multiply this
amount by the scaling factor of 1.06 to obtain $133.21, our final predicted value for average outof-pocket expenditures of 70-year-old males in 2006. Thus, we construct our age profiles by
using our regression to predict the relative values of average out-of-pocket expenditures for the
age-gender groups, and then choosing the levels to match actual aggregate expenditures in the
65–84 age group.
We repeat this procedure for specification 3 to obtain the age profiles of out-of-pocket
spending for four groups: white males, white females, black males, and black females.6 For the
breakdown by race, we chose specification 3 rather than 2 because there appear to be substantial
differences in the shapes of the age profiles across races, and the interactions are jointly
significant at the 1 percent level. Our results — the scaled, predicted age profiles — are
presented and discussed in the next section.
B. Social Security Benefits
The Social Security Administration’s Statistical Supplement for 2008,
http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2008/index.html, contains data on the
average Social Security benefit received by retired workers in December 2007, broken down by
race, gender, and single year of age. We include retired worker benefits only, not disability,
survivor, or spouse benefits. We then use the CPI-W to “backtrack” these average benefits to the

6

The procedure is identical to that for specification 1, except that we scale our model’s predicted out-of-pocket
expenditures to match aggregate expenditures for individuals aged 65–74. This is because our population counts by
race, gender, and age come from the Current Population Survey, http://www.census.gov/cps/, in which age is topcoded at 80 for many years in our sample period. As we cannot know whether an individual with a top-coded age is
younger than 85, we cannot use the aggregate amounts for the 65–84 age group.

where Bti is the benefit received by group i in year t , and COLAs is the cost-of-living-adjustment,
or the percentage by which the benefit in year s is increased to arrive at the benefit in year s  1 .
These amounts are taken to represent what the individuals who are currently in group i would
have received in previous years.
Clearly, there is a potential for sample selection bias. Our analysis for each cohort is
based on individuals who survived until 2007. There is evidence to suggest that there are
substantial differentials in mortality rates across income groups (Waldron, 2007; Cristia, 2007).
Thus, the individuals in our sample are likely to be among the higher earners in their cohort, who
are receiving above-average Social Security benefits. This effect is more likely to be important
for older cohorts. Additionally, not all of the individuals in the 2007 groups would have started
receiving benefits at age 65; some may have delayed until age 70 and received a credit. A final
issue is that, by assuming that the benefit received in 2007 is the benefit received at retirement
plus the subsequent COLAs, we do not account for individuals who may have switched from
receiving a retirement benefit to receiving a survivor’s benefit upon the death of a spouse. It is
possible that a retiree who experienced the death of a spouse might have switched to receiving a
survivor’s benefit (two-thirds of the deceased spouse’s primary insurance amount) if the
survivor’s benefit was larger than the initial worker-only benefit. While these three factors affect
the level of benefits we use as our benchmark, they do not affect our main conclusions of the
relative differences in benefits from different types of benefit indexation policies.

C. Net-of-Medical Expense Benefits
From the average benefits by race, age, and gender, we subtract the premiums paid for
Medicare Part B and our predicted out-of-pocket spending on medical care for the relevant agerace-gender group. Medicare Part B premiums are automatically deducted from Social Security
payments for those Medicare beneficiaries who do not opt out of Part B (inpatient insurance).
This includes the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries. We ignore the means testing for Part B
that became effective in 2007 and assume everyone pays the standard Part B premium, a
reasonable assumption given our focus on individuals who depend primarily on Social Security
for their retirement income.7 This allows us to track the growth of nominal benefits net of
average out-of-pocket medical expenses over time for each cohort within a race-gender group.
We compare this to the growth in the CPI-E for all items less medical expenses.8 The CPI-E net
of medical expenses tells us what our groups would need for non-medical expenses at the end of
2007 in order to have the same purchasing power as they did when they were age 65.
Additionally, we compute the path of each group’s Social Security benefit, starting at age 65, if
benefits had been indexed to the CPI-E instead of the CPI-W. This tells us the extent to which
indexation to the CPI-E would have protected retirees from inflation.9

7

Means testing was in effect in 2007 for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income over $80,000.
We are grateful to Ken Stewart of the BLS for providing us with unpublished CPI-E data. We have the CPI-E for
all items less medical care for 1987–2007. We estimate the values for 1983–1986 as follows. Using the weights for
medical care in the CPI-E for 1987, 2007, and 2008 (the BLS did not retain historical weights for other years), we fit
a quadratic equation through these three values (with year as the independent variable), and use this equation to
predict the weights for the other years. Using the fitted weights, we solve for the growth rate of the CPI-E for all
8

items less medical care in the formula

gt  wt 1gtm  (1  wt 1 )gtnm , where g t is the growth in the CPI-E from

year t–1 to year t, g tm is the growth in the CPI-E for medical care from year t–1 to year t, g tnm is the growth in the
CPI-E for all items less medical care from year t–1 to year t, and wt 1 is the weight on medical care in year t–1.
Using the same procedure for the CPI-W yields estimates of the CPI-W for all items less medical care that are fairly
close to the actual values.
9
The COLAs applied by the SSA are based on the change in the CPI-W from the third quarter (Q3) of the previous
year and Q3 of the current year. For the CPI-E, we only have the December-to-December (rather than the Q3-to-Q3)
changes; therefore, all our analysis using the CPI-E uses December-to-December changes. While these may vary

III. RESULTS
A. Predicted Out-of-Pocket Expenses

Figures 3 and 4 show our simulated average out-of-pocket medical spending for all men
and all women. Figures 5–8 show simulated average out-of-pocket medical spending for black
men, black women, white men, and white women separately. The two solid lines represent the
age profiles of spending in 1987 and 2007. However, as a particular cohort ages, it moves from
the curve for one year to the curve for the next year. Therefore, the age profile for a particular
cohort is steeper than the age profile across cohorts in a given year. The average out-of-pocket
medical spending of the cohorts born in 1918 and 1928 are depicted by the dashed lines. The
vertical bars represent the standard errors of our predicted values.10
Overall, average out-of-pocket expenses are higher — and rise faster — for women than
for men. This result is consistent with other studies of medical expenditures (French and Jones,
2004; Di Nardi, French, and Jones, 2009). Di Nardi, French, and Jones (2009) show that, after
controlling for age, income, and health status, men spend about 20 percent less than women on
medical care. Our results suggest that this relationship appears to be driven primarily by white
men and women; black women tend to have a lower and flatter profile of expenses than black
men.
It is not clear why women overall seem to have higher and steeper expense profiles than
men. One possibility is that, because women tend to outlive men and husbands tend to be older
than their wives, there are more elderly widows than widowers. Older retirees living alone may
have higher out-of-pocket medical expenses because, to some extent, a spouse can substitute for

from the Q3-to-Q3 changes for particular years, the cumulative effect over the years should be approximately the
same.
10
We assume that the standard error of the adjusted prediction is equal to the scaling factor multiplied by the
standard error of the original prediction.

paid caregivers. In our 2006 sample, 56 percent of men aged 85 and above are married,
compared to only 17 percent of women in the same age group. Men aged 85 and above had mean
out-of-pocket medical expenses of $197 per month, compared with $276 per month for women
in the same age group. However, married women aged 85 and above had monthly expenses of
only $181, compared to $295 for single women. Single men’s expenses were only slightly higher
than those of married men — $198 versus $196 per month.11 This provides some support for the
hypothesis that differences in marital status can partly explain the observed gender differences.
One possible explanation for the flatness of the profiles for African-Americans relative to
whites is that elderly African-Americans tend to have lower incomes than elderly whites. Current
Population Survey data, http://www.census.gov/cps/, suggest that 7.9 percent of whites aged 65
and older are living in poverty, in comparison to 22.7 percent of African-Americans aged 65 and
older. Thus, elderly whites are more likely to have income and assets that can be used to finance
high medical expenses. Indeed, Di Nardi, French, and Jones (2009) show that the age profile of
medical expenses is much steeper for higher-income individuals, with differences in spending
across income groups becoming far more pronounced at older ages. For individuals in their mid70s, medical expenses do not vary much with income; however, at age 100, individuals in the top
quintile of lifetime income spend more than 10 times as much as individuals in the bottom
quintile.
We also note that our simulations of average out-of-pocket medical spending mask a
large amount of variation in actual out-of-pocket medical spending experienced by the elderly.
For example, French and Jones (2004) show that individuals face considerable risk of

11

For this calculation, married is defined as either married with a spouse present, or partnered. Single is defined as
married with an absent spouse, separated, divorced, widowed, or never married. We classify individuals who are
married with an absent spouse as single because we are trying to capture the impact of living alone. There are 410
men and 768 women aged 85 and above in the 2006 sample.

catastrophic health costs. Our regression results show that only a small part of the variation in
out-of-pocket medical spending is explained by age, gender, and race. The level of out-of-pocket
medical expenditures for any one individual may vary greatly from our predictions, and any
given individual is also likely to experience more variation from year to year than our averages
by race, gender, and age suggest.
B. Benefits Net of Average Out-of-Pocket Medical Expenses

To summarize our results, we focus on the experience of two cohorts — individuals born
in 1918, and individuals born in 1928. The former cohort is 89 at the end of 2007, and the latter
is 79 at the end of 2007.
Figures 9 and 10 depict the experience of the 1918 cohort of men and women. In each
graph, the solid black line shows the evolution of the cohort’s actual Social Security benefit. The
dashed black line shows the evolution of the cohort’s Social Security benefit if the benefit had
been indexed to the CPI-E. The solid gray line shows the actual benefit net of average out-ofpocket medical spending received by the cohort. Finally, the dashed gray line shows the benefit
net of average out-of-pocket medical spending that would be required to keep pace with inflation
in the prices of non-medical goods (as measured by the CPI-E for all goods less medical care).
These graphs suggest that benefits net of average out-of-pocket medical spending have
risen more slowly than the price index for non-health spending. The same pattern emerges for the
four race-gender groups (the graphs are not shown), and for the 1928 birth cohort. The results for
these other groups are summarized in Table 2. The second column of the table shows, for each
group, the actual monthly benefit net of average out-of-pocket medical expenses at age 65. The
third column shows the actual monthly benefit net of average out-of-pocket medical expenses in
December 2007. The fourth column shows the monthly benefit net of average out-of-pocket

12

medical expenses that would be needed in December 2007 to reflect growth in the non-medical
component of the CPI-E. The last two columns show the percentage difference between columns
3 and 4, expressed relative to both the actual 2007 benefit (“Percent increase needed”) and the
2007 benefit needed to keep up with inflation (“Percent shortfall”).
For example, men born in 1918 have seen their average Social Security benefit, net of
out-of-pocket medical expenses, rise from $527.85 at the end of 1983 (at age 65) to $866.80 at
the end of 2007 (at age 89). However, if this cohort’s average benefit net of out-of-pocket
medical expenses had kept pace with the non-medical CPI-E over that time period, this amount
would have been $1,086.13 in 2007. That is, the average benefit net of out-of-pocket medical
expenses has declined by around 20 percent relative to the non-medical CPI-E. Similarly, women
born in 1918 have seen their average benefit net of out-of-pocket medical expenses decline by
around 27 percent relative to the non-medical CPI-E.
Table 3 shows the benefit net of average out-of-pocket medical expenses that retirees in
both cohorts would be receiving in December 2007 if their benefits had been indexed to the CPIE rather than the CPI-W. The last two columns, again, compare these amounts to the amounts
that would be needed to offset inflation in non-medical goods prices. This table suggests that
retirees would have been more protected from inflation if cost-of-living adjustments had been
based on the CPI-E. However, there is still a shortfall of 10–20 percent for the older cohort and
6–7 percent for the younger cohort. As noted previously, the reason indexing to the CPI-E does
not fully compensate retirees for inflation is that, even if medical costs remained constant over
time for the elderly, they tend to need additional medical care as they age, and the additional
medical spending crowds out non-medical spending. Thus, Social Security benefits net of
average out-of-pocket medical expenses would tend to decline for each individual even if the

13

price of medical care rose at the same rate as the prices of other goods. This idea is illustrated
graphically in Figures 3–8, in the contrast between the solid and dashed lines. A price index for
medical care reflects the vertical shift over time in the solid line (the age profile of spending in
any given year); it does not pick up the horizontal movement that occurs as an individual ages. In
fact, each cohort is moving diagonally — to a higher curve as time passes, and to a point further
to the right on that curve as its members age.
Because actual out-of-pocket medical expenditures are subject to a great deal of
uncertainty, particular individuals may be more or less protected against inflation than shown
here. We emphasize again that we are not claiming retirees are worse off than they were when
they were 65. Our analysis does not allow us to make any such utility comparisons. The CPI
does not adequately account for the fact that higher medical costs may reflect the consumption of
better quality medical care, and retirees may be better off even if they are left with less to spend
on other non-medical goods. All we have shown is that Social Security benefits may not be fully
inflation-indexed in the sense that recipients cannot, from one year to the next, purchase the
same bundle of non-medical goods with their Social Security benefits.
IV. POLICY IMPLICATIONS

Our results suggest that retirees who depend primarily on Social Security have fallen behind
substantially in terms of inflation-adjusted non-medical spending. However, indexing Social
Security benefits to the CPI-E — or alternatively, indexing benefits to keep real non-medical
spending constant — would clearly have an adverse impact on Social Security’s finances.
To provide a back-of-the envelope estimate of the impact on Social Security’s finances, we
begin with our estimates of the rate of increase in aggregate monthly benefit amounts required
from 2006–2007 if (1) Social Security benefits had been indexed to the CPI-E, and (2) Social

14

Security benefits had been adjusted to keep the real net-of-health benefit constant for the average
retiree. We construct these estimates by using the number of retired workers in December 2006
and December 2007 by age and gender, actual average monthly benefits in December 2006 and
December 2007 by age and gender, and our projections of average monthly benefits under
scenarios (1) and (2) above.12
We find that aggregate benefits for individuals aged 65–89 would have risen by 8.3 percent
between December 2006 and December 2007 if benefits had been indexed to the CPI-E. Using
the same methodology, if benefits had instead been adjusted to keep the real net-of-medical
benefit constant, aggregate benefits for individuals aged 65–89 would have risen by 12.4 percent
over the same period. By contrast, actual aggregate benefits for this age group rose by only 5.6
percent between December 2006 and December 2007.13
The 2010 Social Security Trustees’ report provides projections of the Old Age and
Survivor’s Insurance (OASI) program’s income and cost rates through 2085. The income rate is
defined as OASI tax revenue (from payroll taxes and taxation of benefits) as a percentage of
taxable payroll, and the cost rate is defined as the cost of the OASI program as a percentage of
taxable payroll. Using these income and cost rates, combined with the Trustees’ projections of
GDP and taxable payroll as a fraction of GDP, we can project OASI’s total income and costs
through 2085. Under the Trustees’ projections of current law using intermediate assumptions,
total OASI costs are projected to grow at an average rate of 5.6 percent per year between 2006–
12

Beneficiary counts by age and gender were obtained from the U.S. Social Security Administration, Annual
Statistical Supplement, 2008, Table 5.A.1, “Number and average monthly benefit, by type of benefit and race,
December 2007,” http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2008/5a.html#table5.a1, and the U.S.
Social Security Administration, Annual Statistical Supplement, 2007, Table 5.A.1, “Number and average monthly
benefit, by type of benefit and race, December 2006,”
http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2007/5a.html#table5.a1.
13
The actual rate of increase between December 2006 and December 2007 is considerably larger than the rate of
increase in the CPI-W during this time period of 2.3 percent. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the composition
of beneficiaries also changes over time and, because of differential mortality by income, beneficiaries with lower
Social Security benefits tend to die earlier than beneficiaries with higher Social Security benefits.

15

2085, in line with our estimate of the increase in aggregate benefits between 2006–2007.
Consistent with our calculations for the growth in aggregate benefits between 2006–2007, we
assume that indexation to the CPI-E would increase this growth rate by 2.6 percentage points in
each year, and that indexation to maintain the real value of non-medical spending would increase
this growth rate by 6.7 percentage points in each year.14
Figure 11 depicts the income and cost rates of the OASI program under current law, as well
as the cost rate under each of these alternative indexing schemes, assuming the alternative
indexing took effect in 2010. Under current law, persistent deficits begin in 2018. If benefits
were indexed to the CPI-E, persistent deficits would begin two years earlier, in 2016, and if
benefits were indexed to keep real non-medical spending constant, persistent deficits would
begin in 2015.
Starting with the assets of the OASI trust fund in 2009 ($2.2 trillion), we project the trust
fund assets under each of our alternative indexing schemes. For 2010–2019, we assume that
assets in the OASI trust fund earn the interest rates implied by the Social Security Trustees’
short-term intermediate projections of the OASI trust fund ratio and interest income.15 For 2020
and beyond, we assume that the interest rate paid on trust fund assets is 5.7 percent, which is
Trustees’ intermediate projection for the long-term nominal interest rate.16 Under current law, the
OASI trust fund is projected to become exhausted in 2040. Exhaustion of the trust fund would
14

Our analysis of net-of-medical cost spending uses only retired worker benefits, and applies only to workers
between the ages of 65 and 85. We compute estimates of the increase in the aggregate retired worker benefits paid to
this age group under the status quo and alternative policies. Thus, our estimated growth rates for aggregate benefits
are not strictly comparable to the Trustees’ estimates of OASI cost increases, as OASI costs include retired worker,
spouse, and survivor benefits for individuals of all ages, as well as administrative costs. However, our back-of-theenvelope calculation assumes that the differences in the growth rates of aggregate costs across policies should be
similar regardless of whether we look at retired worker benefits for workers aged 65–85, or total OASI costs.

occur 5–10 years earlier (between 2030–2035) if benefits were indexed to the CPI-E, and
between 10–15 years earlier (between 2025–2030) if benefits were indexed to maintain the real
value of non-medical spending.
Given the state of Social Security’s long-term finances, switching to one of these alternative
indexing schemes is unrealistic from a policy perspective. While changes in benefits indexation
can be done in ways that are revenue-neutral (e.g., by reducing initial benefits and increasing the
rate of increase), reforms of this nature would raise distributional concerns and would rely on the
assumption that such a policy would be preferred to one where benefits indexation remained
constant and beneficiaries utilized other savings vehicles to ensure the adequacy of benefits for
later medical expenses. Social Security reform proposals generally take into account the need to
protect low-income retirees from benefit cuts, and many proposals in fact increase benefits to
low-income earners (e.g., National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, 2010). In
this spirit, it might be reasonable for policy makers to consider an alternative indexing scheme to
protect very low-income retirees as part of a more comprehensive Social Security reform
package.
V. CONCLUSION

We have shown that Social Security benefits may not be as safe from inflation as
commonly believed. Because medical costs have been rising over time, and because the elderly
spend a larger fraction of their income on medical care than workers do, the CPI-W does not
properly reflect the inflation experience of Social Security beneficiaries. This is partly reflected
in the fact that premiums for Medicare Part B, in which most retirees participate, have risen
much faster than Social Security benefits. It is compounded by the fact that retirees often have
substantial out-of-pocket medical expenses, which increase as they age. Even experimental

17

measures like the CPI-E may not fully compensate for inflation because they are intended to
reflect the inflation experience of the average elderly person from year to year, rather than the
experience of a given cohort. Given the state of Social Security’s finances, it would not be
fiscally prudent to raise legislated benefits for all retirees to keep pace with the CPI-E or to
maintain average real net-of-medical benefits. However, most Social Security reform proposals
attempt to protect very low-income retirees, and the alternative indexing schemes discussed in
this paper can provide guidance on how to accomplish this goal.
