ABSTRACT

This paper tests models of mutual fund market timing that (1) allow the manager's utility
function to depend on returns in excess of a benchmark; (2) distinguish timing based on lagged,
publicly available information variables from timing based on finer information; and (3) simultaneously
estimate the parameters which describe the public information environment, the risk aversion and the
precision of the fund's market timing signal. Using a sample of more than 400 U.S. mutual funds for
1976-94, the estimates imply that mutual funds behave as risk averse, benchmark investors.
Conditioning on public information variables improves the model specification, and after controlling
for the public information we find no evidence that funds have significant market timing ability.
