Capital Depreciation and Labor Shares Around the World: Measurement and Implications
Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman
NBER Working Paper No. 20606
October 2014, Revised November 2014
JEL No. E21,E22,E23,E25
ABSTRACT
The labor share is typically measured as compensation to labor relative to gross value added ("gross
labor share"), in part because gross value added is more directly measured than net value added. Labor
compensation relative to net value added ("net labor share") may be more important in some settings,
however, because depreciation is not consumed. In this paper we make three contributions. First, we
document that gross and net labor shares generally declined together in most countries around the
world over the past four decades. Second, we use a simple economic environment to show that declines
in the price of capital necessarily cause gross and net labor shares to move in the same direction, whereas
other shocks such as a decline in the real interest rate may cause the net labor share to rise when the
gross labor share falls. Third, we illustrate that whether the gross or the net labor share is a more useful
proxy for inequality during an economy's transition depends sensitively on the nature of the underlying
shocks that hit the economy.

Introduction

A recent wave of empirical work has invigorated interest in theories of factor shares, capital
accumulation, growth, and inequality. In Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014), we documented
a pervasive decline in the labor share of income since 1975 and highlighted its comovement
with the decreasing relative price of investment goods. Piketty (2014) and Piketty and Zucman (2014) similarly characterized this factor share movement and related it to increases in
the capital-output ratio. The decline in the labor share and hypotheses about its causes have
spurred a debate among economists and policymakers as they carry implications for the determinants and future evolution of inequality and growth.
Capital depreciation, often treated as an accounting construct of limited importance in
macroeconomics, plays a critical role in this discussion.1 Depreciation cannot be consumed,
and therefore labor’s share of income net of depreciation (“net labor share”) may be more
closely related to inequality than labor’s share of income inclusive of depreciation (“gross labor
share”). Most economic theory and empirical work, however, are based on gross concepts, in
part because depreciation is not directly measured in national accounts.
In this paper, we make three contributions. First, we document that gross and net labor
shares generally declined together in most countries around the world over the past four decades.
Second, we use a simple economic environment to show how their joint movement is informative
about the causes of their trends. Declines in the price of capital cause gross and net labor
shares to move in the same direction, whereas declines in the real interest rate may cause the
net labor share to rise when the gross labor share falls. Third, we illustrate that it is not
obvious whether the gross or the net labor share is a more useful proxy for inequality during
an economy’s transition. Instead, the relationship between factors shares and inequality during
the transition depends crucially on the nature and timing of the underlying shocks that hit the

Summers (2014) points out that the distinction between the marginal product of capital net of depreciation
and its gross counterpart is important for the behavior of factor shares. Krusell and Smith (2014) argue that
the exclusion of depreciation significantly changes Piketty’s quantitative predictions of how a growth slowdown
would impact the capital-output ratio, a point also recognized by Jones (2014). Additionally, Bridgman (2014)
and Rognlie (2014) question the extent to which the observed declines in gross labor shares were accompanied by
declines in net labor shares.

economy.
We begin our analysis by documenting the time series and cross country patterns of labor
share trends. We use the dataset introduced in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) to examine
trends in four labor share measures that differ in their sector coverage (total economy vs.
corporate sector) and treatment of depreciation (gross vs. net). We focus particularly on
estimates from the corporate sector as they offer several key advantages. Corporate labor share
measures are less affected by the existence of unincorporated enterprises and proprietors whose
reported income combines payments to both labor and capital, a well-known difficulty in the
measurement of the labor share (Gollin, 2002). Further, gross and net corporate labor shares
are largely insensitive to the measurement and economic interpretation of residential housing,
a controversial topic in studies of the economy-wide labor share (Bonnet, Bono, Chapelle, and
Wasmer, 2014; Jones, 2014; Rognlie, 2014; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2014).
All four measures of the labor share have decreased meaningfully since 1975. For the average
country, gross and net labor share declines were similar in the corporate sector, and the net
decline was even larger in the total economy. In addition, the cross-country variation in net
labor share declines closely mirrors that in gross labor share declines. The pattern of declining
labor shares in the corporate sector is somewhat different when we weight countries by their
size, predominantly due to the influence of the United States. In the U.S. corporate sector, the
value of depreciation has increased as a share of value added since 1975. As a result, its net
labor share declined by 2.6 percentage points, compared to the 4.7 percentage point decline in
its gross labor share. Finally, we confirm that both the time series and cross sectional patterns
that we document are quantitatively similar in the newly released data from the Penn World
Tables (PWT 8.0) that allows for measurement of depreciation for a larger sample of countries.
Next, we analyze the joint dynamics of depreciation and factor shares within a simple variant
of the neoclassical growth model. Production combines labor with two types of capital, one that
depreciates slowly and another that depreciates rapidly. Consistent with measurement practices
in national accounts, depreciation as a share of gross value added in our model fluctuates in

2

response to shifts in the composition of capital and to changes in the aggregate capital-output
ratio. An increase in depreciation as a share of gross value added causes the net labor share to
increase relative to the gross labor share.
We use the model to derive simple analytical relationships that link steady state changes in
gross and net labor shares to each other and to the underlying shocks. We start by considering
a decline in the real interest rate, a case emphasized in important recent work by Rognlie
(2014). Rognlie highlights a mismatch between Piketty’s explanation for the behavior of net
labor shares and estimates of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor that
typically come from studies, including our own, of gross labor shares. He demonstrates that,
in response to declines in the real interest rate, the elasticity of substitution in net production
is significantly smaller than that in gross production. Summers (2014), in his book review of
Piketty, makes this point most forcefully:
Piketty argues that the economic literature supports his assumption that returns
diminish slowly (in technical parlance, that the elasticity of substitution is greater
than 1), and so capital’s share rises with capital accumulation. But I think he
misreads the literature by conflating gross and net returns to capital. It is plausible
that as the capital stock grows, the increment of output produced declines slowly,
but there can be no question that depreciation increases proportionally. And it is
the return net of depreciation that is relevant for capital accumulation. I know of no
study suggesting that measuring output in net terms, the elasticity of substitution
is greater than 1, and I know of quite a few suggesting the contrary.

We confirm in our environment the hypothesis of Summers (2014) and reproduce the finding
of Rognlie (2014). A decline in the real interest rate causes the capital-output ratio to rise,
which increases depreciation as a share of gross value added. For reasonable parameterizations,
reductions in the real interest rate cause the net labor share to increase despite a decrease in
the gross labor share. This happens when the elasticity of substitution in net production is less
than one while the elasticity of substitution in gross production exceeds one.
By contrast, we show that gross and net labor shares always move in the same direction in
response to technology-driven changes in the relative price of investment goods.2 Declines in the
2

The decline in the relative price of investment can also explain other macroeconomic developments over the

3

price of capital mute the increase in depreciation’s share of gross value added that arises from
the higher real capital-output ratio. Whereas Summers (2014) and Rognlie (2014) emphasize
that the real interest rate affects the net rental rate proportionately more than the gross rental
rate, we emphasize that declines in the relative price of investment affect both gross and net
returns to capital proportionally in steady state. As a result, if labor share movements are
driven by declines in the relative price of investment, the elasticities of substitution in gross
and net production are both on the same side of (or equal to) one.
Our empirical findings demonstrated that very few countries experienced opposite movements in gross and net labor shares over the past four decades. Our theoretical analysis points
out that gross and net labor shares always move in the same direction in response to changes
in the relative price of investment, but not necessarily in response to changes in the real interest rate. Collectively, our results can reconcile declines in the price of investment when
the elasticity of substitution in gross production exceeds one, as highlighted by Karabarbounis
and Neiman (2014), with the narrative of Piketty (2014) that rests on a high elasticity in net
production.
Finally, we address the question of which labor share concept – gross or net – one should use.
We clarify that, depending on data availability and the economic application, both concepts can
be useful and complementary. Since depreciation is imputed by national statistical agencies, a
preference by researchers for direct measurement argues for the use of gross concepts. On the
other hand, unlike the rest of gross income, depreciation cannot be consumed by households. A
body of work since at least Weitzman (1976), therefore, has argued that net concepts may be
more closely associated with welfare and inequality than their gross counterparts. We point out
that this logic most naturally applies in an economy’s steady state. It is not obvious whether
gross or net concepts are most useful for thinking about welfare and inequality during the
economy’s transition.
past decades. As Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997) argue, technology-driven changes in the relative price
of investment goods constitute a major driver of economic growth. Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull, and Violante
(2000) show that the increase in capital equipment is a key force for understanding the increase in the skill
premium.

4

To illustrate this point, we introduce into our model two types of agents, workers and
capitalists. Workers cannot save. The dynamics of consumption inequality between these two
groups are governed by the assumption that capitalists, in contrast to workers, are forward
looking and have a positive saving rate. The net labor share perfectly summarizes inequality
between workers and capitalists in the steady state of our model as, in each period, workers
consume their labor earnings and capitalists consume their capital income net of depreciation
expenses. This simple relationship, however, ceases to hold along the transition. Intuitively,
the net labor share only captures the net income position of workers relative to capitalists in a
specific time period, whereas welfare-based measures of inequality take into account the entire
future paths of consumption for workers and capitalists. We use several examples to compare
gross and net labor share measures to welfare-based measures of inequality. A preference for
the gross or net labor share as a simple proxy for inequality during an economy’s transition
depends sensitively on the nature and timing of the underlying shocks that hit the economy.

Depreciation and the Labor Share

The gross labor share is more commonly used than the net labor share, in part because it is
better and more directly measured. The net labor share may be more appropriate in some
settings, however, because depreciation is not consumed. In this section, we first discuss how
depreciation is measured in the national accounts. We then demonstrate that most countries
have exhibited meaningful and broadly similar declines since 1975 in both their gross and net
labor shares.

2.1

Measurement of Depreciation

Depreciation, typically referred to as consumption of fixed capital in the national accounts, is
the decline in the value of fixed capital due to tear, damage, obsolescence, and aging. It is
the implicit income that is consumed by the use of fixed capital and therefore it is included in
gross domestic product (GDP), the measure of gross value added for the aggregate economy.
This inclusion of the value of depreciation in GDP does not, in general, require any explicit
5

measurement of depreciation.3 The cost of consuming fixed capital during production is reflected in final goods prices, in the value of produced goods, and in factor prices. Depreciation
will therefore be automatically incorporated when GDP is measured using the expenditure,
production, or income approaches.
To measure net domestic product (NDP), which equals GDP less depreciation, national
accountants combine estimates of depreciation rates with estimates of the value of the capital
stock. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates depreciation
rates since 1996 for more than 100 different types of capital, typically using the geometric
method that imposes a constant rate of depreciation every period. Estimates of the geometric
rate of decline in the economic value of assets come from studies of the prices of used assets
in resale markets, as described in Fraumeni (1997). These asset-specific depreciation rates are
then used to derive the capital stock for each type of asset and for the aggregate economy,
along with the associated values of depreciation (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2003).4 Note
that the depreciation rate for each type of capital is assumed to be constant. Changes in the
depreciation rate of the aggregate capital stock purely reflect compositional changes in the
types of capital used by the economy.
The 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA) recommends measurement of depreciation
in a way that is intended to be theoretically appropriate and comparable across countries.
The international comparability of measured depreciation depends on the coverage of fixed
assets and the depreciation rates used. As OECD (2014) recognizes, depreciation practices
differ across countries with some countries using geometric profiles and others using straightline profiles (corresponding to a value of depreciation for each asset and each period that is
constant in levels terms rather than in percentage terms). For example, the national accounts in

There are some exceptions to this. For example, estimates of depreciation are used to calculate the value
added from non-market producers such as the government, which also contribute to GDP.

the United Kingdom apply the straight-line method to derive estimates of depreciation and the
net capital stock (Dey-Chowdhury, 2008). Some international databases such as the PWT and
KLEMS attempt to make depreciation patterns more comparable across countries by applying
the depreciation rates used by the BEA to each country.
Some analyses may call for a theoretical focus on the net labor share in addition to, or
instead of, the gross labor share. As an empirical matter, however, the difficulty in imputing
depreciation likely makes net labor share measures less precise than gross labor share measures.
This same observation underlies the pervasive use of GDP rather than NDP in discussions of
aggregate economic performance. As described in the 1993 SNA, “In general, the gross figure
is obviously the easier to estimate and may, therefore, be more reliable...”.

2.2

Results from National Accounts Data

Our primary analyses use the national accounts dataset introduced in Karabarbounis and
Neiman (2014), which combines a number of sources including country-specific web pages and
digital files and physical books published by the United Nations (UN) and Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).5 Our data are annual, start in 1975, and
generally conform with SNA standards, though there are certainly some differences in conventions across countries and over time. Importantly for our purposes, we make use of the
“Detailed National Accounts,” which allow us to distinguish between government, household,
and corporate flows.
We now introduce four different concepts of the labor share of income sL . All four labor
shares express a measure of compensation of employees as a fraction of a measure of income.6
5

We refer the reader to Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) for details on the construction of these data. The
analyses presented in this paper use the “KN Merged” version of our dataset. Our qualitative conclusions do not
change if we instead use the “OECD and UN” version, which is based only on data digitally available and readily
downloaded from OECD and UN web pages with minimal additional manipulations.
6
Typical labor share measures include taxes on production in income but not in the compensation of employees.
Therefore, this practice effectively treats all taxes as capital income. A reasonable alternative treatment of these
taxes is to augment compensation of employees with a proportion of taxes that equals the share of non-tax value
added belonging to compensation. We document in the Online Appendix that the tax share of value added has
not changed significantly either in the United States or globally since 1975. An adjustment for taxes, therefore,
does not matter quantitatively for the decline in the labor share. This evidence argues against the claim made in
Bridgman (2014) that taxes on production meaningfully alter the declining trend in the labor share.

7

They differ in their treatment of depreciation as well as their sectoral coverage. The four labor
share measures are:
1. “Total Gross Labor Share”:
sTL G =

Total Compensation of Employees
.
Gross Domestic Product

2. “Total Net Labor Share”:
sTL N =

Total Compensation of Employees
.
Gross Domestic Product − Total Depreciation

3. “Corporate Gross Labor Share”:
sCG
L =

Corporate Compensation of Employees
.
Corporate Gross Value Added

4. “Corporate Net Labor Share”:
sCN
=
L

Corporate Compensation of Employees
.
Corporate Gross Value Added − Corporate Depreciation

We index these four labor share measures with superscript j ∈ {TG, TN, CG, CN} and denote
the labor share of type j in country i at year t by sjL,i,t .
Across all notions of the labor share, compensation of employees includes wages and salaries
in cash or in kind. Compensation also includes various supplements to wages such as employer
contributions for sickness, pensions, health insurance, and social insurance. It also tries to
capture the estimated value of stock option grants (Lequiller, 2002).
The first two labor share measures, j ∈ {T G, T N }, are taken from the overall economy.
The “Total Gross Labor Share” is the most commonly used measure and simply divides compensation of employees by GDP. The “Total Net Labor Share” has the same numerator, but
it instead subtracts depreciation in the economy from GDP and uses that net income concept,
equal to NDP, in the denominator.7
7

In U.S. data, “Total Compensation of Employees” equals Line 2 from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) Table 1.12. “Gross Domestic Product,” can be found in Line
1 of NIPA Table 1.1.5. “Total Depreciation” is typically referred to in the national accounts as consumption of
fixed capital and can be found for the U.S. economy as Line 5 in NIPA Table 1.7.5. Equivalently, “Net Domestic
Product” can be used directly as the denominator instead of GDP minus depreciation and is found in Line 1 of
NIPA Table 1.9.5.

8

The second two labor share measures, j ∈ {CG, CN }, use the same corresponding concepts
in the numerators and denominators, but with the measures taken only from the corporate
sector, which includes both financial and non-financial corporations. “Corporate Gross Value
Added”, for example, is the contribution of the corporate sector to total GDP (and in fact
is often referred to as Corporate GDP).8 The precise definition of the corporate sector varies
somewhat across countries. The sector generally includes most market producers located in
a given country that are not controlled by the government and excludes most unincorporated
enterprises and sole proprietors.9 In both the United States and the world more generally,
the corporate sector accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP. This share has remained largely
stable over our sample period.
2.2.1

Time Series Patterns Using Raw Data

We start our analysis of the time series patterns of these labor share measures at the global
level by running regressions of the form:
sjL,i,t = γtj + γij + ji,t .

(1)

Each regression only includes countries with at least 15 observations of the corresponding labor
share measure and excludes the few outliers with labor shares above 0.99 or below 0.01. We
include country fixed effects γij because we do not have a balanced panel. Country fixed effects
eliminate the influence of entry and exit of countries with different labor share levels on our
inference about the time series behavior of the global labor share.
To show the time series behavior of the global labor share in the total economy, Figure 1
plots the year dummies γtj from four regressions, all normalized to equal the average level of
the corresponding labor share measure in 1975. The solid line, corresponding to the “Gross
8

In U.S. data, the required information on the corporate sector is found in NIPA Table 1.14. “Corporate Compensation of Employees” equals Line 4, “Corporate Gross Value Added” equals Line 1, “Corporate Depreciation”
equals Line 2, and “Corporate Net Value Added” equals Line 3.
9
Most unincorporated enterprises are included in the household sector and “can range from single persons
working as street traders or shoe cleaners with virtually no capital or premises of their own through to large
manufacturing, construction or service enterprises with many employees.” (United Nations Statistical Commission,
2008). A small share of unincorporated enterprises may be included in the corporate sector as something called
quasi-corporations if their business accounts are sufficiently detailed.

Unweighted” measure, plots the gross labor share of the total economy for the average country
in our sample. The long-dashed line, corresponding to the “Gross Weighted” measure, plots
the year dummies when observations in regression (1) are weighted by GDP, after translating
GDPs into current U.S. dollars using market exchange rates. Because regressions are weighted,
movements in this measure of the labor share disproportionately reflect movements in the labor
shares of the largest economies. Fitting these two lines with a linear trend implies that the
global gross labor share for the total economy has declined globally by 4.6 percentage points
(unweighted) and 4.0 percentage points (weighted) between 1975 and 2012.
The two other lines plot the unweighted and weighted labor shares net of depreciation.
The net labor share measures differ from their corresponding gross measures for three reasons.
First, the net labor share is by definition greater than the gross labor share because it excludes
depreciation from the denominator. Second, for the weighted regressions, differences in depreciation across countries render weights based on GDP different from weights based on NDP.
Third, the set of countries included is different. We only include countries with at least 15
observations in each regression. For some countries and years we do not observe depreciation

and therefore cannot calculate net labor shares. Of the 70 countries with data sufficient to
calculate 15 years of total gross labor shares, only 59 have data sufficient to do the same for
net labor shares.10 Fitting the net labor share series with a linear trend implies a decline of
7.0 percentage points for the unweighted regressions and a decline of 3.6 percentage points for
the weighted regressions.
Table 1 summarizes the results from our global time series analyses. As seen in the top
two rows, the decline in the net labor share is larger than the decline in the gross labor share
in percentage points for the average country in our sample (corresponding to the unweighted
regressions). The net labor share declines by slightly less in percentage points relative to the
gross when we weight countries by their GDP. Since net labor shares are higher in levels, the
table also reports these declines in percent terms.
We next characterize movements in the labor shares of the corporate sector. As in our
previous work, we emphasize corporate labor share measures because they are less affected by
the existence of unincorporated enterprises and proprietors whose income combines payments
to both labor and capital. This issue, most notably highlighted by Gollin (2002), is quite
10

The largest countries without sufficient data on depreciation include Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, and
Saudi Arabia. Throughout our analyses we have verified that our results do not change meaningfully when we
require that a country have both measures in order to be included in the regression.

problematic for the consistent measurement of the labor share across countries and over time
because the share of these enterprises likely varies across countries and over time.
In the context of this paper, a focus on measures of the labor share taken from the corporate
sector offers two additional benefits. First, it removes any influence of residential housing on the
dynamics of depreciation and, therefore, on the gap between gross and net labor shares. This
is in line with key dynamics in recent papers such as Bridgman (2014) and Rognlie (2014),
which instead emphasize the changing composition of the corporate capital stock. Second,
papers such as Bonnet, Bono, Chapelle, and Wasmer (2014), Jones (2014), Rognlie (2014),
and Acemoglu and Robinson (2014) have noted that elasticity estimates derived from the
relationship between labor shares and the capital-output ratio are sensitive to the inclusion of,
and method of deflating, housing capital. Reasonable arguments can be made as to whether
housing capital should or should not be excluded from analyses aiming to estimate the shape
of the production function. This issue applies less to the corporate sector, where nearly all
structures are offices, factories, and commercial stores used for productive purposes.
Figure 2 plots four times series corresponding to unweighted and weighted gross and net
12

labor shares in the corporate sector. The corporate labor share is in general larger than the
labor share in the total economy shown in Figure 1 for two reasons. First, GDP includes certain
taxes on products that are excluded from the equivalent denominator in the corporate sector.11
Second, the income of owners of unincorporated enterprises that are part of the household sector
is included in value added but is not included in compensation of employees. Implicitly, the
economic activity of those proprietors is treated as having a zero labor share. This downward
force impacts labor share measures for the total economy but it impacts less measures for the
corporate sector.
We summarize our results in Table 1. When we do not weight our regressions, the corporate
gross and net labor shares decline by 9.2 and 9.7 percentage points, or by 13.4 and 14.5 percent
respectively. These declines are so similar because, for the average country in our sample,
corporate depreciation as a share of corporate gross value added has not changed meaningfully
over time. When we weight observations in our regressions with value added, we observe a 5.4
percentage point decline in the corporate gross labor share and a 3.7 percentage point decline in
the corporate net labor share. The smaller decline in the weighted net measure largely reflects
the increase in depreciation relative to value added in the U.S. corporate sector.
2.2.2

Time Series Patterns Imputing Net Labor Shares

The above analyses only included labor share measures for countries with raw data sufficient
to directly construct these measures. To examine the sensitivity of our results when a more
representative global aggregate is examined, we now make imputations that rely on proportionality assumptions when a country has sufficient data to get close to, but not all the way
to, a given labor share measure. More formally, let Ωj for j = {T G, T N, CG, CN } denote the
0

set of countries i that contain at least 15 years of data on sjL,i,t . Let ηtj,j denote the year fixed
effects from regressions of the form:
sjL,i,t
sj0
L,i,t

= ηtj,j0 + ηij,j0 + j,j0

Our imputation applies to a country that has a measure of sj0

j,j0
we impute the latter as sj0
L,i,t × ηt . For example, New Zealand has data on its total net labor

but not on its corporate net labor share sCN

measures in each year, ηtCN,T N , and then impute sCN

L,i,t for New Zealand as sL,i,t = sL,i,t ×ηt

Note that this implies that while the inclusion of the imputed New Zealand corporate net labor
share can impact the global trends of gross and net labor shares, it cannot by construction
influence their relative movement. Similarly, Tunisia has data on its corporate gross labor
CN
share sCG
L,i,t but lacks data on its corporate net labor share sL,i,t . We might therefore wish to

use ηtCN,CG to impute its corporate net labor share.12
Figure 3 plots the unweighted corporate net labor share under three alternative methods.
For some of our analyses we also use this procedure to impute the corporate gross labor share using ηtCG,T G .
This imputation also includes some large developed countries such as Australia and Japan.

The solid line shows the path of corporate net labor shares without any imputation (i.e. using
“Only Raw Data”) and therefore is identical to the path of the unweighted corporate net labor
share shown in Figure 2. The short-dashed line, labeled “Imputation 1,” imputes the corporate
net labor share when it is missing from the raw data using a particular sequence of steps. First,
if a country’s corporate gross labor share is available, it imputes the corporate net labor share
using ηtCN,CG . Next, if the corporate gross labor share is unavailable but the total net labor
share is available, this method imputes corporate net labor share using ηtCN,T N . Finally, if only
the total gross labor share is available, this method imputes the corporate net labor share using
the product of these factors, ηtCN,CG × ηtCG,T G . The long-dashed line, labeled “Imputation 2,”
instead imputes the corporate net labor share directly from the total gross labor share using
ηtCN,T G .13 As can be seen in Figure 3, all methods for calculating the global corporate net labor
share reveal similar patterns of decline.14
2.2.3

Cross Country Patterns

Above we documented that both gross and net labor shares exhibit declines. This is true
both for the average country and for the world as a whole. We now document that the cross
country pattern of corporate gross labor share declines largely mirrors that of the net labor
share declines. Figure 4 compares plots of these two trends for each country, measured in
percentage points per 10 years. The plot includes all countries with 15 years of raw data on
both measures. Most countries, such as Mexico, lay below the plotted 45-degree line, indicating
that the corporate net labor share declined by more than the gross. Others, such as the United
States (difficult to visualize as it is close to the origin), are above the 45-degree line, and
therefore had a smaller decline in the net labor share.
Overall, the cross sectional variation in the two trends is quite similar. Of the 24 countries
with declines in their gross labor shares, 22 experienced declines in their net labor shares. Of
the 20 countries with statistically significant at the 5 percent level declines in their gross labor

We have confirmed the robustness of our results to reversing the order of the first two steps in “Imputation 1.”

Countries lacking the corporate net labor share have systematically lower corporate gross labor share and total
net labor share values, causing the two imputed lines to start at a level significantly lower than the raw series.

Results from the Penn World Tables

The methodology and quality of depreciation measurements in the national accounts is heterogeneous across countries. The recently released PWT 8.0 (Feenstra, Inklaar, and Timmer,
2013) contains new measures of the capital stocks, labor shares, and depreciation. The key
advantage of using the PWT is that it harmonizes measurement of depreciation across countries. It does not allow us to focus on the corporate sector as we can in the Karabarbounis and
Neiman (2014) dataset, but depreciation is measured for a broader set of countries than in our
baseline analysis.
The PWT 8.0 starts with depreciation rates for six types of capital (structures, transport
equipment, computers, communication equipment, software, and other machinery). These
asset-specific depreciation rates are assumed to be constant across countries and years and equal
the official BEA depreciation rates (given in Fraumeni, 1997). The aggregate depreciation rate
for each country equals the weighted average of asset-specific depreciation rates, with weights

given by the value of each asset in the total capital stock. As a result, cross-country differences
in the overall depreciation rate exist purely due to cross-country differences in the composition
of their capital stocks. We refer the reader to Inklaar and Timmer (2013) for more details on
the measurement of the labor share, capital, and depreciation in PWT 8.0.
PWT 8.0 offers four underlying series of the labor share for the total economy. Three of
the four series build upon the adjustments proposed by Gollin (2002) to incorporate data on
the self-employed in calculating the labor share for the total economy. The fourth series adds
the value added in agriculture to labor compensation of employees, with the rationale being
that agriculture is labor intensive and it employs a large fraction of the self-employed in poor
countries. The PWT constructs a “best estimate” labor share from these four series for each
country and we use this measure in our analysis.15
15

The first method attributes all the self-employed’s “mixed income” – a term referring to the fact that their
income likely pools compensation for labor and capital – to labor. The second method assumes that the selfemployed’s income is split between labor and capital in the same proportion as in the rest of the economy. The
third method assumes that self-employed earn the same wage as other workers and uses data on the number of
self-employed to impute their labor earnings. For most countries, and especially the developed ones, the best
estimate labor share uses the second adjustment. We drop those observations where the labor share is assumed
to be constant within a country or is interpolated by the PWT.

Figure 6: Gross vs. Net Labor Shares in the PWT

As in our previous analyses, we run unweighted and weighted regressions of the form shown
in equation (1). Figure 5 plots the year fixed effects for the gross and the net labor shares.
The bottom rows of Table 1 summarize the percentage point and percent declines in the labor
shares. Similarly to the facts documented in the Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) dataset, the
PWT data shows comparable declines in both gross and net labor shares. This reflects the fact
that the value of depreciation as a fraction of gross value added did not increase significantly
over time.16
Figure 6 plots the country trends in gross labor shares against the country trends in net
labor shares, after removing an outlier (Azerbaijan) to improve the figure’s presentation. Most
of the points lay below, but close to, the plotted 45 degree line, which indicates that the crosscountry variation in gross labor share trends closely tracks the variation in net labor share
trends. Of the 60 countries with declines in their gross labor shares, 56 also experience declines
in their net labor shares. Of the 41 countries with statistically significant declines in their gross
labor shares, 40 also experienced statistically significant declines in their net labor shares.
16

The depreciation rate as estimated by the PWT shows a mild increase from roughly 4 percent to roughly 4.2
percent over the sample period for the average country.

A Model of Gross and Net Labor Shares

Having demonstrated a robust pattern of declining gross and net labor shares globally, we now
use a variant of the neoclassical growth model to understand the joint dynamics of depreciation,
factor shares, and inequality. We recognize that the model abstracts from various subtleties
that affect both factor shares and inequality. Despite its simplicity, the model serves two
purposes. First, we use the model to characterize analytically how the relative movement of
gross and net labor shares across steady states depend on the nature of the underlying shocks
and the structure of production. We demonstrate conditions under which gross and net labor
shares necessarily move in the same direction. Second, we work through some examples to
illustrate that, even in this simple model, the relationship between factor shares and inequality
is complicated when an economy is not in steady state.
We consider an infinite horizon deterministic economy with periods t = 0, 1, 2, ..., populated
by two types of agents indexed by i ∈ {N, K}. Workers (i = N ) simply consume labor
earnings and do not save. Capitalists (i = K) decide how to allocate capital income between
consumption and investment. All inequality in this economy therefore reflects the “between”
component in comparing these two groups.
There are two types of capital indexed by j ∈ {L, H} that are produced with different
technologies and that depreciate at different rates. Changes in the composition of the aggregate
capital stock generate changes in the aggregate depreciation rate. We think of capital KtH
as a high depreciation asset (for instance, capital related to information and communication
technologies) and KtL as a lower depreciation asset (for instance, structures and transportation
equipment).

Final Goods.

Competitive firms produce gross final output Yt with a constant elasticity of

substitution (CES) technology:

the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital, α ∈ (0, 1) is a distribution parameter,
AK,t denotes capital-augmenting technology, and AN,t denotes labor-augmenting technology.
Final goods producers rent labor and capital at prices Wt and Rt and sell final output at a
price of one.
Denoting by CtN workers’ consumption and by CtK capitalists’ consumption, final output
Yt in the economy is allocated between consumptions and intermediate inputs used in the
production of investment goods:
Yt = CtN + CtK + ItL + ItH .
Investment Goods.

Firms in investment sector j = {L, H} purchase inputs Itj from final

goods producers and produce output Xtj =

that is used to augment the capital stock.

Investment firms are perfectly competitive and sell their output at price pjt = ξtj .17
Workers.

There is a measure χ of identical workers. Each worker exogenously supplies nt

units of labor, so aggregate labor supply is Nt = χnt . Workers cannot save and simply conN
sume their labor earnings in each period, cN
t = Wt nt = Ct /χ. Instantaneous utility from

consumption is given by U cN
t .

Capitalists.

There is a measure 1 − χ of identical capitalists. We denote the consumption of

K
L
each capitalist by cK
t = Ct /(1 − χ) and their investment in the two capital stocks by xt and
L
H
xH
t . Capitalists choose capital stocks kt+1 and kt+1 and bonds dt+1 to maximize the discounted

We note that, without adjustment costs, the price of each unit of type-j investment equals the price of
each unit of the type-j capital stock. Therefore, we use the terms “price of investment” and “price of capital”
interchangeably and apply the price ξtj to translate capital into units of the numeraire good.

purchased in period t − 1 equals the gross return investors would have earned had they invested
j
this unit in bonds, ξt−1
(1 + rt ), less today’s resale value of undepreciated capital, ξtj (1 − δ j ).

Finally, bonds are in zero net supply, (1 − χ)dt = 0.
Capital Intermediaries.

Capital intermediaries produce competitively the capital bundle

Equilibrium.

An equilibrium for this economy consists of quantities and prices such that

capitalists maximize their utility, firms maximize their profits, and all capital and labor markets
clear. Goods market clearing and zero profits in the production of final goods imply:
Yt = CtN + CtK + ξtL XtL + ξtH XtH = Wt Nt + Rt Kt .
21

(12)

The first part of equation (12) says that final gross output is allocated between consumption
of workers, consumption of capitalists, and investment in the two types of capital. The second
part of this equation shows how total gross income is distributed between labor and capital.
From zero profits in the production of the aggregate capital bundle, gross capital income equals
Rt Kt = RtL KtL + RtH KtH .

(14)

Consistent with national accounting practices, depreciation rates for each type of capital are
treated as constants δ j . The aggregate depreciation rate δt varies over time only because of
changes in the composition of the capital stock. The share of depreciation in gross income can
be written as:
ψt =

δt ξt Kt

Yt

(15)

which highlights that it varies over time with the aggregate depreciation rate δt and the aggregate capital-output ratio ξt Kt /Yt .

where Yt is gross value added, Yt − δt ξt Kt is net value added, and ψt is the share of depreciation

when capital-augmenting technology AK,t increases. When σ = 1, the case of Cobb-Douglas

Labor Shares in Steady State: Two-Sector Model

To derive simple analytical expressions that summarize the relationship between gross and net
labor shares, we now focus our analysis on changes across steady states of the model. We drop
time subscripts of variables to denote steady state values. A key input in our derivations is
the rental rate of aggregate capital. Using the first-order conditions for investment, equation
(9), together with the definitions of the price of aggregate capital in equation (13) and the
aggregate depreciation rate in equation (14), we write the rental rate in steady state as:
R = ξ(r + δ).

(18)

N
We will use equation (18) to express sG
L and sL as a function of capital-augmenting technology

AK , the real interest rate r (that in steady state simply equals 1/β − 1), the depreciation rate
of aggregate capital δ, and the price of aggregate capital ξ.
We emphasize that δ and ξ are endogenous variables in our three-sector model and will in
general vary as a function of the exogenous shocks β, AN , AK , ξ H , and ξ L . We summarize the
implications for labor shares of these shocks in terms of the aggregates δ and ξ as this allows
us to compare our model with two-sector models that feature exogenous (or no) movements in
δ and ξ. In Section 5 we examine how endogenous changes in δ and ξ impact our conclusions.

4.1

Relative Changes in Gross and Net Labor Shares

Gross and net labor shares are linked through the share of depreciation in gross value added
ψ. Substituting equation (18) and the definition of the gross labor share sG
L = 1 − RK/Y into
the definition of ψ in equation (15), we write ψ in steady state as:

Depreciation as a share of gross value added is decreasing in sG
L , increasing in δ, and decreasing
in r.
N
Substituting equation (19) into the equation sG
L = sL (1 − ψ) and totally differentiating the

resulting expression, we can relate the log change of the net labor share to the log changes of
the gross labor share, of the aggregate depreciation rate, and of the real interest rate:

(20)

Consider the case when shocks either do not change the real interest rate and the aggregate
depreciation rate or change these variables by the same rate, d log (δ) = d log (r). Examples of
such shocks include capital-augmenting technological progress AK and exogenous movements
in the relative price of capital ξ in a two-sector model. In such a case, the last term of equation
(20) equals zero and gross and net labor shares necessarily move in the same direction. If we
N
set the labor shares to their average values observed in our sample, sG
L = 0.64 and sL = 0.73,

we obtain that the log change in the net labor share equals 75 percent of the log change in the
gross labor share.
More broadly, if some combination of shocks causes the aggregate depreciation rate to grow
proportionately more than the real interest rate, d log (δ) > d log (r), this will create a force
that increases the growth rate of the net labor share relative to that of the gross labor share.
Changes in δ or r, unlike changes in ξ or AK , can potentially cause gross and net labor shares
to move in different directions across steady states.

4.2

Gross and Net Elasticities

In Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014), we related declines across countries and industries in
the relative price of investment ξ to declines in the gross labor share sG
L since 1975. This
comovement underlies our estimate that the gross elasticity of substitution σ, which relates
movements in the real capital to output ratio and the gross rental rate of capital, exceeds
one. Rognlie (2014) correctly notes that one should be careful in importing estimates of σ to
analyses of movements in the net labor share such as those in Piketty (2014) and Piketty and
24

Zucman (2014). Instead, Rognlie highlights that the “net elasticity of substitution” , which
relates movements in the real capital to net output ratio and the net rental rate of capital, is
the key elasticity governing the response of the net labor share. He demonstrates that  < σ
and, therefore, evidence that σ > 1 does not imply that  > 1 and is insufficient to understand
the directional response of the net labor share. In fact, he argues that most estimates of the
gross elasticity, including those that modestly exceed one, imply that the net elasticity is below
one.
This argument seems at odds, however, with equation (20) which shows that gross and net
labor shares always move together if the percent change in the depreciation rate equals that of
the real interest rate. The results appear at first to be inconsistent because the expression in
Rognlie (2014) for the net elasticity  assumes that all movements in the rental rate of capital
are due to changes in the real interest rate. As Rognlie notes, his results need not hold if
changes in the relative price of capital also affect movements in the rental rate of capital.
To illustrate this key difference, we define the gross and net elasticities of substitution as:

We can solve for the each term in brackets in equation (22) under alternative assumptions on
which shock generates movement in the system from one steady state to another. To make our
point analytically and in the simplest way, we compare cases in which only one shock operates
at a time.18
We start by considering movements in labor shares caused by changes in β as this case most
closely corresponds to the analysis of Rognlie (2014). Changes in β cause movements in the real
18
The first bracket can be written as 1 − d log(1 − ψ)/d log(K/Y ). Using the definition of ψ in equation (19)
we take d log(1 − ψ)/d log(K/Y ) = [K/Y (1 − ψ)] [−δξ − δ(K/Y )dξ/d(K/Y )]. For the second bracket, we use
d log(R) = ((r + δ)dξ + ξdr) /R and d log(R − ξδ) = (rdξ + ξdr) /(R − ξδ).

Since sN
L > sL , the net elasticity is always smaller the gross elasticity of substitution. As

explained by Rognlie, a given change in r affects the net rental rate proportionately more than
the gross rental rate (i.e. the second bracket in equation (22) is smaller than one), which mutes
the response of the net labor share. For example, using the estimated elasticity σ = 1.25
from Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) together with the average labor share values in our
N
sample, sG
L = 0.64 and sL = 0.73, equation (23) implies that the net elasticity  = 0.94. This

calculation accords with the claim of Summers (2014) that “I know of no study suggesting that
measuring output in net terms, the elasticity of substitution is greater than 1...”.
Next, we consider movements in labor shares caused by changes in ξ as this case most
closely corresponds to the evidence in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014). All other shocks are
assumed to equal zero, dr = dδ = dAK = 0. Evaluating equation (21) under these assumptions
yields:

Equations (23) and (24) differ because shocks to the relative price of investment, unlike those
to the real interest rate, cause proportional changes in the net and the gross rental rate (i.e. the
second bracket of equation (22) now equals one). Equation (24) shows that if the only shocks
G
are to ξ and σ = 1, then  = 1.20 Since sN
L > sL , the net elasticity exceeds the gross elasticity

whenever the gross elasticity exceeds one, i.e.  > σ > 1, and the net elasticity is smaller than
the gross elasticity whenever the gross elasticity is smaller than one, i.e.  < σ < 1. Under the
assumption that declines in the rental rate of capital are caused only by declines in the relative
19

The real interest rate r in our model is the net return to an investment other than physical capital accumulation.
As such, r should be interpreted broadly as an after-tax return on some alternative asset. Our analysis of the
impact of r on labor shares would similarly hold for changes in any components of the gross return on physical
capital R (such as those due to capital taxes) other than changes to ξ and δ.
20
N

That is, both labor shares are constant. Recall that sG
L is constant when σ = 1 and sL = sL /(1−ψ). Equation
(19) shows that ψ is also constant in this case because dδ = dr = 0.

26

price of investment, σ > 1 is a sufficient condition to generate declines in both the gross labor
N
share and the net labor share. Using the values sG
L = 0.64, sL = 0.73, and σ = 1.25 we obtain

 = 1.29.
To summarize, our theoretical analysis shows that declines in the gross labor share caused
by declines in the real interest rate are likely to be associated with increases in the net labor
share. By contrast, declines in the gross labor share caused by declines in the relative price
of investment necessarily also imply declines in the net labor share. Our empirical analysis
documented that both gross and net labor shares declined globally since 1975. Therefore,
under σ > 1, the decline in the relative price of investment is a more plausible explanation of
the decline in the labor share than a decline in the real interest rate.21

Labor Shares in Steady State: Three-Sector Model

Equations (17) and (20) express steady state labor shares as functions of the depreciation rate
of aggregate capital δ and the price of aggregate capital ξ. In Section 4, we took changes in
δ and ξ as given, but in our three-sector model these two variables endogenously respond to
the underlying shocks. We now turn to numerical solutions across steady states which allow
us to understand how various shocks and parameters affect the response of both labor shares,
allowing δ and ξ to change endogenously. The key parameters we focus on are the elasticity
of substitution between capital and labor σ and the elasticity of substitution between the two
types of capital θ.22
In Figure 7, we show responses across steady states to a 2/3 decline in the price of the
high-depreciation capital ξ H . All four panels plot the elasticity of substitution between capital
types θ on the x-axis and contain three lines. The solid horizontal line shows the pre-shock
value in the initial steady state, the dashed line shows the post-shock steady state value for the

We can plug values from the PWT for d log sN
L , d log sL , d log (δ), sL , and sL into equation (20) to
back out the implied d log (r). With weighting, the results imply that the real interest rate barely changed. The
unweighted results actually imply an increase in the real interest rate.
22
For our numerical solutions, we set AN = N = 1 and α = 0.40. We choose the low depreciation rate δ L = 0.02
and the high depreciation rate δ H = 0.20. As we vary θ and σ, we pick β, ξ H , ξ L , and AK to always target the
N
same initial steady state values of sG
L = 0.64, sL = 0.73, R = 0.10, and δ = 0.04.

Figure 7: Decline in Price of High Depreciation Capital

Cobb-Douglas case with σ = 1, and the dotted line shows the post-shock steady state value
when σ = 1.25.
The top left panel shows the behavior of the aggregate depreciation rate δ, which equals
0.04 in the initial steady state. We note that the response of δ does not depend on the value
σ, which is why the two lines are indistinguishable in that plot. Changes in δ purely reflect
changes in the composition of the capital stock, which is governed by the elasticity θ. When
θ = 1, the share of each type of capital in total capital is constant, and therefore δ does not
change in response to the ξ H shock. When θ < 1, the two types of capital are complements. In
response to a lowering in ξ H , the share of the low depreciation capital in total capital increases
and δ decreases. The opposite happens when θ > 1.23

where χj = Rj K j /(RK) and ζ j = χj (r + δ)/(r + δ j ). A decline in ξ H implies that δ decreases when θ < 1, stays
constant when θ = 1, and increases when θ > 1. We also note that δ is increasing in r for any value of θ.

in ξ H . When σ = 1, sG
L is constant. For σ > 1, the gross labor share declines because the
aggregate rental rate of capital R = ξ(r+δ) declines. As θ increases, the decline in the aggregate
price of capital ξ becomes stronger and dominates the increase in δ, causing the gross labor
share to decline by even more.
The top right panel shows the response of the depreciation share in gross value added ψ. It
is useful to recall equation (19) that shows that ψ = (1 − sG
L )δ/(r + δ) in steady state. When
σ = 1, the gross labor share is constant. Additionally, with θ = 1, δ does not change, and
therefore ψ does not change. With σ = 1, but θ > 1, δ increases and so ψ increases relative to
the pre-shock steady state value. With σ = 1.25, the gross labor share declines which causes
an upward shift of the ψ response relative to σ = 1 for any given θ. Comparing the top panels
for the σ = 1.25 case illustrates that δ and ψ need not move in the same direction.
Finally, the bottom right panel shows the change in the net labor share following the decline
in ξ H . In proximity to θ = 1, where δ does not change, the net and the gross labor shares
move in the same direction as dictated by equation (20). Since the gross labor share is constant
for the σ = 1 case, the net labor share is also constant at θ = 1. Since the gross labor share
29

declines for the σ > 1 case, the net labor share also declines at θ = 1. As we increase the value
of θ above one, the wedge between the growth of gross and net labor shares increases because
of the rise in δ (and ψ).
Figure 8 shows steady state changes in response to a lowering of r (due to a 3 percentage
point increase in β). Unlike the case of the ξ H shock, in response to a decline in the real interest
rate, δ always declines. For sufficiently low values of θ, ψ increases. Therefore, while the gross
labor share declines when σ > 1, the directional response of the net labor share depends on
the elasticities σ and θ. For relatively lower values of θ and σ, the increase in depreciation as
a share of gross value added ψ is sufficiently strong to actually cause an increase in sN
L.

Transitional Dynamics of Labor Shares and Inequality

Our analysis thus far has shown that both gross and net labor shares are informative for welfare
and macroeconomic dynamics. For example, their relative movement can teach us about the
source of shocks hitting the economy as well as about the structure of production. An additional
source of interest in labor share movements stems from their relevance for inequality, which we
now turn to in this section.
It is helpful to start with the relationship between the ratio of consumption and the net
labor share in steady state:

(R − δξ) K

.
N
N
C

(25)

Shocks that decrease the net labor share in steady state are directly mapped into increases in
the consumption of capitalists relative to the consumption of workers. Since the consumption
streams for each type of agent are constant in steady state, this consumption ratio is a welfarerelevant measure of inequality. In this sense, changes in the net capital share from one steady
state to another are perfectly informative about inequality. Motivated in part by this argument,
we demonstrated empirically that both gross and net labor shares have in fact declined globally
since 1975 and we demonstrated theoretically that a shock to the relative price of capital will
cause both labor share measures to move together across steady states.

Figure 9: Increase in Labor Augmenting Technology

We stress, however, that this direct mapping of the net labor share to inequality is a limiting
result that applies only in steady state. We now analyze some experiments that relate labor
shares to inequality over the transition in response to various shocks. In these experiments, we
treat a model period as a year and assume the period utility is given by U = (1 − 1/ρ)−1 c1−1/ρ
with ρ = 0.5. We set σ = 1.25, θ = 1.10, and use the other parameter values given in Section
5.24
We start by considering a labor-augmenting productivity shock AN . This is a interesting
case because AN does not affect the gross or net labor shares in steady state.25 The relationship
between labor shares and inequality is therefore non-trivial only during the transition.
The top left panel in Figure 9 shows the path of the shock. Desired investment increases
in response to the increase in AN,t , pushing up the real interest rate rt and the rental rate for
aggregate capital Rt . Since σ > 1, the increase in Rt causes an increase in the gross labor share
24

The value σ = 1.25 comes from Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014). We choose θ = 1.10 because with this
value the depreciation rate δ changes from 4.0 to 4.2 percent in response to the ξ H shock shown in Figure 7. This
change is consistent with the change in δ observed for the average country in our sample.
25
Changes in AN across steady states do not impact ξ, r, δ, and the rental rate R = ξ(r + δ). As a result, we
see in equations (17) and (20) that neither labor share measure changes in response to changes in AN .

31

sG
L,t , shown in the top right panel of Figure 9.
Though the increase in rt differentially impacts the returns on high and low depreciation
capital, their absolute and relative movements are small. As a result, there is only a minor
reallocation of capital between the two types, and the depreciation rate δt and aggregate capital
price ξt remain relatively constant. Because the capital-output ratio decreases, the share of
depreciation in gross income ψt = δt ξt Kt /Yt declines and is always below its pre-shock steady
state value. As a result, the net labor share always lies below the gross labor share during the
transition. In fact, in this particular example, the net labor share initially falls below its preshock steady state value and then quickly reverts to a value that roughly equals its pre-shock
steady state value.
A simplistic analysis might observe the relative stability of the net labor share and conclude
that the AN shock did not affect inequality. Such a conclusion would not hold, however, for
various notions of inequality during the transition. In the bottom left panel of Figure 9 we
plot the change in the ratio of consumption CtK /CtN relative to its initial steady state value
G
together with changes in two transformations of gross and net labor shares, (1 − sG
L,t )/sL,t
N
N
N
K
N
and (1 − sN
L,t )/sL,t . Recall that in equation (25), (1 − sL,t )/sL,t equals Ct /Ct in steady

state. However, for the largest part of the transition the ratio of consumption CtK /CtN and the
G
transformation of the gross labor share (1 − sG
L,t )/sL,t lie below their pre-shock value, whereas
N
(1 − sN
L,t )/sL,t is roughly stable at its pre-shock value. If one wanted to argue that workers are

receiving a “larger share of the pie,” the behavior of the gross labor share would have been
more informative than the behavior of the net labor share in making this argument.26
A similar result is obtained if we look at welfare-based measures of consumption inequality
that take into account the full consumption path. For each type of agent i = {N, K}, we define
the time-varying consumption-equivalent change in welfare as the solution λit of the equation:


1
1−β





U C i (1 + λit ) = U Cti + βVt+1 .

26

(26)

The ratio of consumption goes up in the first few periods after the shock reflecting the fact that capitalists’
consumption responds to changes in permanent income whereas the workers’ consumption is simply pinned down
by contemporaneous labor earnings.

discounted present value of utility flows had the shock not taken place (and hence the economy
had remained in the initial steady state). The variable λit is the percent increase in consumption
(relative to the initial steady state) required to make the agents indifferent between receiving
and not receiving the path with the shock.
The bottom right panel of Figure 9 shows that both workers’ and capitalists’ welfare increases immediately with the positive AN,t shock. However, and in parallel to the dynamics
of relative consumption, workers gain relatively more than capitalists throughout the transition. The dynamics of the gross labor share more closely capture this decrease in welfare-based
inequality than the dynamics of the net labor share.
While this example is admittedly simple, it does allow us to draw some general lessons for the
informativeness of labor shares for inequality outside of steady state. In response to shocks that
increase desired investment, capitalists may optimally decide to postpone consumption early
on in return for higher consumption later on. The net labor share only captures the net income
position of workers relative to capitalists in a specific time period. Net income inequality does
not necessarily translate into consumption inequality when some agents are forward looking
and can use savings and borrowing to achieve an optimal allocation of resources across time.
Table 2 summarizes quantitatively the dynamics of factor shares and inequality for various
shocks.27 For each shock, the rows of the table show the percent change from the pre-shock

N
N
N
steady state in four measures of inequality, (1 + λK
t )/(1 + λt ), Ct /Ct , (1 − st )/st , and
G
(1 − sG
t )/st . The first three columns show these changes 10, 20, and 50 periods after the shock,

and the fourth column (t → ∞) shows the changes when the system reaches the new steady
state. For example, consider the response 20 periods after an increase in AN,t . The table shows
N
K
N
that (1 + λK
t )/(1 + λt ) is 5.2 percent below its pre-shock steady state value, Ct /Ct is 7.4
27

Across all four experiments we standardize the path of the shocks in the following way. Let x0 denote the
pre-shock steady state value and xT denote the value of the shock in the final steady state. T is the first period
in which the shock converges to its final value. We then generate the path of the shock as xt = (t + 1)ν with
ν = log(xT /x0 )/ log(T + 1). In all experiments we set T = 20. We set AN,T /AN,0 = 1.30, AK,T /AK,0 = 1.30,
βT /β0 = 1.0323, ξTH /ξ0H = 1/3.

nology shock is that this shock changes the steady state distribution of consumption between
the capitalists and workers. As shown in Table 2, both labor shares are unable to capture the
dynamics of inequality in the first few periods. In the initial 10 periods after the shock, both
labor share transformations increase whereas both the relative consumption and the welfarebased measures of inequality decrease. Capitalists ultimately benefit more than workers in
this case, with the bulk of the relative gains realized only 30 or more periods after the shock
(corresponding to t > 40 in the figure). The dynamics of the gross labor share appear more
closely linked to the behavior of inequality during most of the transition.
N
The inequality measure (1 + λK
t )/(1 + λt ) captures relative changes in the workers’ and

capitalists’ welfare. Across steady states, its percent change exactly equals the percent change
in relative consumption. We report in the final column of Table 2 the share of the first 50
transition periods in which the remaining three inequality measures have the same sign (i.e.
N
have increased or decreased) as (1+λK
t )/(1+λt ). We think of this as one summary statistic for

the degree to which the labor share measures teach us about inequality during the transition.
In the cases of shocks to AN and ξ H , we find that both labor shares move together with
35

N
(1 + λK
t )/(1 + λt ) during nearly all of the first 50 periods and therefore are useful proxies

for the directional change in inequality. This is not the case for the neutral technology shock
AN = AK , for which both labor share measures do not capture the directional change in
inequality in more than one-third of the first 50 periods. In the case of a β shock, the net labor
share unambiguously outperforms the gross labor share as a proxy for inequality during the
transition.

Conclusion

Gross and net labor shares have declined around the world over the past several decades.
These factor shares are subject to different measurement concerns, but both have the potential
to offer insights into the structure of production, the shocks that hit the economy, and the
implications of these shocks for macroeconomic dynamics. We demonstrate that, in fact, the
joint behavior of gross and net labor shares is informative for these issues, particularly in a
multi-sector environment with rich dynamics in the price of capital and the economy-wide
depreciation rate. Declines in the relative price of investment goods, unlike declines in the real
interest rate, are consistent with the observed declines in both labor shares.
The finding of declining global labor shares has generated significant attention in part due
to their association with increasing inequality. We think this is a useful starting point and a
reasonable basis for interest in factor share dynamics. But significant further work is needed.
In a simple model we demonstrated the inadequacy of either labor share measure to capture
inequality in a simple way outside of steady state, even when the economy is exposed only
to basic shocks. The environment imposed a stark, unrealistic, and unchanging split between
hand-to-mouth workers and dynamically optimizing capitalists. It abstracted from critical
features for inequality such as capital-skill complementarity, redistributive taxation, and lifecycle considerations. We hope that future research can enrich the empirical and theoretical
relationship between factor shares and inequality.
