    "abstract": "\n\nThe 1930's American Dust Bowl created archetypal \"Dust Bowl migrants,\" refugees from environmental collapse and economic upheaval.  I examine this archetype, comparing migration from more-eroded counties and less-eroded counties to distinguish Dust Bowl migrants from other migrants in this era.  Migrants from more-eroded counties were more \"negatively selected,\" in years of education, than other migrants who were \"positively selected.\"  These Dust Bowl migrants struggled economically, especially in California.  Despite migrants' struggles, however, I estimate strikingly modest impacts of the Dust Bowl on average incomes that contrast with its enduring impacts on agricultural land.\n\n",
