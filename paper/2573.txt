The Time-Variation of Risk and Return
in the Foreign Exchange and Stock Markets

ABSTRACT

Recent empirical work indicates that, in a variety of financial markets,

both conditional expectations and conditional variances of returns are timevarying.

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether these joint

fluctuations of conditional first and second moments are consistent with the
Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin capital-asset-pricing model.

We test the mean-variance

model under several different assumptions about the time-variation of
conditional second moments of returns, using weekly data from July 1974 to
December 19a6, that include returns on a portfolio composed of dollar, Deutsche
mark, Sterling, and Swiss franc assets, together with the US stock market.

The

model is estimated constraining risk premia to depend on the time-varying
conditional covariance matrix of the residuals of the expected returns
equations.

The results indicate that estimated conditional variances cannot explain
the observed time-variation of risk premie.

Furthermore, the constraints

imposed by the static CAPM are slwsys rejected.

Introduction
Rates of return on international financial assets are characterized by
statistical properties that are quice common to all financial markets: they are
highly volatile and largely unpredictable.

These properties make it very

difficult to extract statistically reliable estimates of systematic exchangerate and asset-price movements, and are at the root of the generally poor
empirical performance of inter tional asset pricing models.

Nevertheless, two

important results have been uncovered by empirical researchers and tan be
considered a fair characterization of the data:

(a) expected returns

on foreign

assets vary over time (Cumby and Obscfeld [1981[ and the numerous articles that
followed, recently surveyed by Frankel and Meese [19871); (b) the volatility of
returns on foreign assets also changes over time (Cumby and Obatfeld [l984j,
Hodrick and Srivastava [1984], Hsieh [1985}, smong others).

The purpose of this

paper is to determine whether the observed fluctuations of conditional variances
and conditional expectations of returns in international financial markets are
consistent with a family of asset pricing models)

We test the mean-variance capital-asset-pricing model (CAPM) under several
different assumptions about the time-variation of conditional second momenta of
returns, using weekly data from July 1974 to December 1986.

The model is

estimated constraining risk premis to depend on the time-varying conditional
covariance matrix of the residuals of the expected returns equations.

Unlike

all formal tests of capital asset pricing models we are aware of, we pool data

This strategy is

juatified by the sheer size of the stock market in international financial
portfolios: in our sample, the averaga share of the US stock market is .55,
versus .31 for dollar-denominated external assets, and only .06 for pound
sterling and Deutaohe mark aaseta, respectively.

Furthermore, we oan explore

whether some puzzling aspects of the behavior of risk premia, which have been
noted in the stock market by Mehra and Prescott [1985] , and in the foreign
exchange market by Fama [1984]

and Frankel ]l966[, have common characteristios

Some intuition for the failure to estimate the coefficient of risk aversion

with any precision using this model can be obtained from the literature on the
volatility of the risk premium.

Fama [19843 shows that

if the assumption of

rational expectations is true, the variance of risk premia in the foreign
variance of
exchange market should be of the same order of magnitude as the
forward premia.

Frankel [19863

argues that the variation of asset supplies,
he assumption of constant 2 is true, cannot

possibly explain the numbers reported by Fama.

For example, in the case of the

Deutsche mark, and assuming that p—2, observed fluctuation of asset supplies can

only predict a standard error of the risk premium that is 1/200 of the standard
error of the risk premium estimated with unrestricted projection equations,

Thus the difficulties encountered in estimating the coefficient of risk aversion
are due to the exceedingly low variation of

appear to imply widely different magnitudes for the predicted volatility of risk

This result is especially disturbing, since all of the models that have

been used for the process followed by conditional second moments are just
projection equations, with no theoretical grounding.

Therefore it seems

particularly important to explore alternative specifications for the process
followed by conditional second .oments.

This is the task of this paper, which

Empirical Results
The models surveyed above were estimated using weekly data.

Since the

asset supplies data can only be constructed on a monthly basis, the weekly
series of asset shares have been computed by interpolating the own-currency
values of asset supplies, and by translating them into dollars at the actual
weekly exchange rates, to compute the value shares.

We believe that this method

should not affect our estimatts dramatically, because exchange-rate chsnges
account for a large fraction of the variation of dollar values of asset
supplies, as shown in table 1.

In the case of the stock market we use the

actual capitalization data, that era available on a weekly basis.

The

currencies in the portfolio, together with the US dollar, include the British
pound, the Deutsche mark and the Swiss franc.

Our ssmple ranges from July 5,

1974 to December 19, 1986, and includes 651 observations.

report the maximum-likelihood estimation results, for the

homoskedastic model, and the GARtH model of equation (12).

The tables report

point estimates and t statistics for the coefficient of risk aversion, the
constant terms in the regressions, and the parameters of the conditional
covariance matrix.

We also compute the Lagrange multiplier test for the CAPM

restrictions implied by equation (l4).

The Lagrange multiplier is computed as follows. Define n and (n+r) as the
number of parameters for the restricted and unrestricted models, respectively.
The test statistic is q'H 'q, where q is cha score vector- -defined as the
derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameters- -end

point. By the Cramer-Rso inequslity, the Hassisn matrix is itself computed
from the outer product of the score vectors.

Releasing the constraint that the oovarianoe of returns is

insignifiosmtly different from zero.

Second, we find that the autoregressive

the restrictions of the CAPM are strongly rejected.
Table 4 contains a number

of

specification tests on the two models of

conditional covariances: constant correlations (equation (13)) and the model of
table 2 (equation (12), referred to as 'General Model).

The table shows that

the explanatory value of the variables we include in the model of time-varying
covariances is very similar under the two alternative specifications:

in both

cases we reject at very high confidence levels the hypothesis that lagged rateof-return innovations have no marginal explanatory power over a constant, and
the hypothesis that movements in conditional variances are not autocorrelated.
Interest rates appear to be highly significant in the case where conditional
correlations are constant, but are just below the 10 percent significance level

in the more general model.

This discrepancy between the two models is due to

the way interest rates enter equations (12) and (13), as we explain in footnote
S above.

In summary, our empirical analysis suggests three main results:

first, the

time variation of conditional second moments is not adequately captured by the
simple models which include as explanatory variables only the lagged forecast
errors.

Second, the risk aversion parameter does not seem to be estimable with

17

any precision.

And third, constraining conditional correlations to be constant

does not dramatically affect the significance of explanatory variables of the
conditional covariance matrix.

Our objective in this section is limited to the comparison between

These were obtained by projecting excess

squared return and the own-asse share.

Although these forecasts are quite noisy,

the size of the fluctuations is remarkable.

The ex-ante excess return of the

stock market over dollar deposits fluctuates within plus and minus 1 percent per
week, while the ex-ante excess return of

OPt

assets fluctuates within plus and

minus 0.6 percent per week: hence the annualized numbers in figures 1 and 2,
which are obtained by multiplying the weekly returns by 52.
The ability of the CAPM to reproduce these numbers depends on the
volatility of asset supplies, the volatility of conditional second moments, and
the size of the risk aversion coefficient.

Does the volatility of conditional

second moments--which was not taken into account by Frankel's original
calculations--make the model's predictions closer to the unrestricted estimates?

To answer this question we plot the predicted values of the risk premis obtained
from the model whose estimates are reported in table 3.

the estimated conditional variances of returns and the estimated risk premia for
the US stock market and DM assets.12

Although we do not report predicted values

of expected returns and stendard errors in all alternative models, we should
point out that the exclusion of nominal interest rates from the specification of
the conditional covariance matrix does not affect the estimates of means and
standard errors of returns in any noticeable way.

On the other hand, excluding

the lagged conditional variance term does: as expected, the persistence of
fluctuations of conditional variances, and, to some extent, of risk premia,
decreases dramatically.

This is highlighted by figures 5 and 6. which report

the eatimatea of conditional standard errors of the stock market and Deutsche

mark aaaeta, obtained when the (significant) autoregreaave tern is omitted.
The moat striking fact appeering from a comparison of figures 1 and 2 with
3

and 4 is that the fluctuations of the estimates of risk premia implied by the

OAPM are dramatically different from those of the unrestricted ones.

Although

this evidence iS only of a qualitative nature, it is borne out by the Lagrange
multiplier tests diacuaaed above.

beeeen 6 and 10

percent per year, while the unconstrained estimate

Suiuyery and Concludina Remarks

This paper has specified and estimated a static capital asset pricing model
to explain the empirical behavior of rates of return in the US stock market and
in the foreign exchange market.

The purpose of the paper was to explore the

role of alternative specifications for the process followed by the conditional
second moments of returns.
The empirical findings indicate that the

specification

of the process

followed by conditional second moments of returns affects significantly the
estimate of the risk aversion parameter, and as a result, affects the estimates

The correlations are: 0.99 for the pound, 0.97 for the Deutsche mark, 0.99
for the Swiss franc, and 0.99 for the stock market,

While the two models predict the same fluctuations of risk premia, the
average risk premia differ in the two models, because the estimates of the
risk aversion parameters differ.

of the ex-ance risk premium on various assets.

Both lagged conditional

varisnoes and nominal interest rates have significant predictive ability for
second moments of asset returns,

For all specifications of conditional

variances we estimate, however, the overidenrifying restrictions imposed by the

CAPM are rejected at very high confidence levels.
Simulations with the estimates of the model show that our esoimares of the

CAPM fail to reproduce unrestricted estimates of risk premia cbrainsd from
projection equarions.

Furthermore, since the general shapes of astimsted

conditional variances (their peeks end rroughs) do not differ dcamericelly
across the various specifications ye adopt, it appears that the empirical
failure of the CAPM ran be ascribed to the absolute lack of resemblance of the
fluctuations of condrional verienoes end the fluctuations of unresrrcred
estimates of risk premia.

This lack of resemblance is clearly nor made up for

by fluctuations in asset supplies.
Overall, the results of this paper tend to be discouraging to those who
believe that the static CAPM is a fair description of the determination of
equilibrium returns in world financial markets.

However, the evidence also

seems to suggest rhec e thoroughly satisfactory test of the static CAPH would
probably require the inclusion

of meny more assets then those we use, end a

specification of the process followed by conditional second
moments. Both of these extensions involve the construction of very large
models, that--given the current computational technology--crc quite difficult
much more

and

complete

expensive to estimate.

Apyendx A: Unit Intertemporel Substitution and the "Static" CAPM

In this appendix, which draws heav1y from Ciovannini and Weil {1988, we
prove that the equations chatacterizing the "static" Sharpe-Litner-Mossin
capital asset pricing model can be derived in a dynamic model where
interremporel substitution and risk aversion are expltcirly distinguished? and
where the eThscicity of intertemporal subacirucion is constrained to unity.

kenton

[l9fl'

showed that assuming logarithmic utility (which implies unit

intertemporal eLasticity of conaumpccon), the dynamic saving and portfclio
selection problem collapses co one whera the consumer maximires the expectation

of the logartrhm of end-ofperiod weelth

The advantage of the framework

outlined here? as stressed by Giovannini and Weil [1988],
Merton's model

is that? unlike

no restrictions are imposed on the coefficient of risk aversion

following runcrional equation:

(we omit, for simplicity but without

of generality, the riskless asset and assume that only risky investments

are available).

For notational ease,

we denote the maximand in (al) as

U[C,(EV)], where U is referred to as an "aggregator" function.

23

Equation (al) has been studied by Wail [19871988].

intertemporal substitution (as suggested by considering the corresponding
problem under certainty) while p is the coefficient of relative risk aversion
(as suggested

by the fact chat the risk premium for a lottery on permanent

consumption is proportional to p

see Wail [1987]).

By application of L'Hopical rule, the following can be established:

The expression for (a4) in terna

of the original tastes parsmeters requires the solution to the functional
equation (al).

Given the assumed preferences, it can be verified that V is an

power function of wealth, and that optimal consumption, in the oase of
logarithmic intertemporal preferences, is just (1-5)

times current wealth.

Using these facts, some algebra establishes that (a4) is equivalent to the
following:

Appendix 3: Data Sources

Daily observations on spot axchanga rates were obtainad from DRI.

Daily

stook market returns are from the CR52 database, as well for the aggregate
capitalization of the market in dollars.

We used the value-weighted index

constructed by CR52.

Weekly one-week Eurocurrency rates were collected from the Financial Times.
Exchange rates are recorded at 11:30 am (EST), while the Financial Times
data are at the close of the London market, or 12:00 noon (EST),

CR52 stock

market returns are based on closing trade prices of all securities on the NYSE
and on the AMEX, at 4:OD pm (EST).
Aggregate asset supplies data were constructed following the method
described by Frankel (l982

.

All

the data,

together with a detailed description

of the construction of the asset supplies in dollars, marks, pounds and Swiss
francs, are available from the authors on request.

General Model:

The notation g(e) is used for the various restrictions on the models of
equations (12) (Heteroskedastic, Ger.eral Model) and (13) (Heteroskedaatic,
Constant Correlations).
g(r) indicates that only constant terms are includea;
g(r,A) indicates that constant terms and lagged rate-of-return innovatfons are
included; g(r,A,B) includes all of the above, plus lagged conditional variances,
while g(r,A,B,') stands for the general case, which includes all of the above
plus nomna1 interest rates. See section ii for details on the specification of
conditional covariance matrices. The chi-square statistics test the incremantal
contribution of the last term in each g(') function.
