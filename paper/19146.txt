ABSTRACT
This paper illustrates that evaluating alternate abatement polices that affect the growth path of an economy
on the basis of their effects on asset valuation may not be welfare enhancing. We show that the class
of abatement polices considered in the integrated assessment literature are robust with respect to the
choice of a discount factor if lifetime consumption equivalents are used as a metric. We argue against
a global welfare function in the presence of significant global household heterogeneity. While economic
analysis is a useful tool for evaluating different policies for a homogenous class of households, inter
household comparisons are an ethical issue.

Introduction
We characterize macroeconomic interventions as interventions that change

the growth path of an economy. The interventions may be due to natural causes
such as the “Black Death” in the fourteenth century or the last ice age or they
may be man made, such as the Great Wars in the twentieth century.
Anthropogenic climate change is an issue that has come to dominate the
global public policy agenda. It is argued that if left unchecked, the accumulation
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will negatively impact future per capita
consumption. At the heart of the debate is evaluating alternative policies for
greenhouse gas abatement. An abatement policy reduces current per capita
consumption in exchange for a higher growth rate in the future. The default
option of no intervention results in higher per capita current consumption but a
lower future growth rate.
This paper illustrates that evaluating alternate abatement polices that
affect the growth path of an economy based on their impact on asset valuation1
may not be a good measure of the welfare consequences of the policies2.
The framework used for evaluating alternative policies in the climate
modeling literature, the various integrated assessment models, are an extension of
neoclassical growth theory. Asset pricing in this context has been studied in
Prescott and Mehra (1980), Brock (1982) and Donaldson and Mehra (1984). An
insight that simplifies the analysis is the observation that the cross equation
restrictions on asset prices and consumption do not depend on whether the
consumption process is endogenously determined, as in an economy with

production or is exogenous as in an exchange economy3. The relative prices of the
date, event-contingent, composite-consumption goods are proportional to the
marginal rates of substitution of consumption. The deus ex machina of this class
of asset pricing models is that for a given endowment process, household trading
of financial assets is motivated by a desire to smooth consumption, both over
time and across states at a point in time. The desirability of an asset in this
model reflects its ability to smooth consumption. Hence, assets that pay off in
future states when consumption levels are high – when the marginal utility of
consumption is low – are therefore less desirable than those that pay an
equivalent amount in future states when consumption levels are low and
additional consumption is more highly valued4. As a consequence, the price of a
claim to a unit of consumption at some future time t scales in proportion to the
marginal utility of consumption at that time. Both the household’s elasticity of
intertemporal substitution and risk aversion play a crucial role in this class of
models.
In these models, the price of an asset at time t, pt with stochastic payoffs

usually expressed as a function of the marginal rate of substitution of
consumption between time s and t of the agents who trade securities. For
example, in a widely cited and influential paper, Lucas (1978) models ms,t as

β s−tu ′(cs ) / u ′(ct ) . Here ct is the aggregate per capita consumption at time t, u ′(ct )
is the marginal utility of consumption at time t and β is the rate of time
preference. In the case of isoelastic utility, ms,t specializes to β s−t (cs /ct )−α , where

α is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and, simultaneously, the reciprocal of
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
In this model class, Mehra and Prescott (1985) find that the premium for
bearing non-diversifiable aggregate risk is small. This premium6 is approximately
equal to ασc2 where σc2 is the variance of the growth rate of consumption. For the
U.S. the historical average for σc2 is 0.0018. Since plausible values of α are upper
bounded by 10, we will abstract from this small premium and consider an
economy with no aggregate uncertainty. Uncertainty is not essential to the point
we establish and this abstraction simplifies the analysis7.
The point of departure of this paper is the observation that any major
intervention in the economy, such as climate abatement policies that affect the
∞
consumption process, will change the stochastic process {ms,t }s=t+1
thereby

changing prices relative to current consumption of all assets in the economy. The
intuition is straightforward. A reduction in the growth of an economy, will in
steady state, have two effects. It will reduce future consumption8 and it will lead
to a reduction in the equilibrium interest rate. The first effect tends to reduce the
relative value of assets while the second increases the value of the assets relative

It is exact if the growth rate of consumption is i.i.d and log-normally distributed.
The issues involved in the treatment of uncertainty, including uncertainties about the magnitude,
timing, and impacts of climate change, are discussed in Howarth (2003), Weitzman (2007, 2009)
and Ackerman et al. (2009).

to current consumption. The net result is ambiguous. We illustrate this in section
2 with a simple example.
The paper consists of 5 sections. In section 3 we evaluate a stylized
abatement policy based on two measures: asset valuation and household welfare,
measured in lifetime consumption equivalents and show that these lead to
inconsistent rankings. In section 4 we address heterogeneity in preferences and
issues of aggregation. Section 5 concludes the paper.

An Illustrative Example
Consider a certainty analog of an endowment economy of the type

analyzed in Mehra and Prescott (1985). There is a single infinitely lived
household with isoelastic preferences. This unit orders its preferences over
consumption paths by

∞

∑β

t

t=0

ct1−α −1
1− α

,

0 < β < 1, 0 < α < ∞

(2)

where ct is the per capita consumption.
The parameter β is the rate of time preference, which describes how
impatient households are to consume. If β is small, people are highly impatient,
with a strong preference for consumption now versus consumption in the future.
The parameter α measures the curvature of the utility function. When α = 1,
the utility function is defined to be logarithmic, which is the limit of the above
representation as α approaches 1.
As modeled, the household lives forever, which implicitly means that the
utility of parents depends on the utility of their children9.

Land is the only asset in this economy. Its ownership entitles the owner to

. The price of land at time t, pt is10:

The discount factor is the sequence {ms,t }s=t+1
with ms,t = β s−t (cs /ct )−α .

Consider two such economies, identical in every respect expect that land in
one economy produces the consumption good with a growth rate of 2% while in
the other the growth rate is 1%. The household elasticity of intertemporal
substitution is 0.5 ( α = 2 ) and its β = 0.99 . Consumption levels are 1 in both
economies at time 1.
Let p0h and p0l be the price of land in the high growth and the low growth
economies respectively at time 0. Using the pricing relation above, it is
straightforward to find relative valuation of the land in the two economies in
today’s consumption equivalent.
p0h / p0l =

(1 + g l )α−1 − β
(1 + g h )α−1 − β

(4)

For an economy characterized by the above parameters we find that

p0h / p0l = 2 / 3 even though the household welfare is higher in the higher growth
economy irrespective of α . The reason for this counter - intuitive result is that,
as mentioned earlier, the discount rate is a function of the growth rate of

by11:

r = −ln β + αµc

(5)

where µc = ln(1 + g) is the continuously compounded growth rate of
consumption. For the U.S, over the past 100 years the growth rate of
consumption has averaged slightly less than 2%. With α = 2 , in the high growth
economy the discount rate is 5% while in the low growth economy it is 3%. In
the low growth economy the increase in the value of land due to the lower
discount rate more than offsets the reduction due to the decrease in consumption.
In the case when household α is 1 (logarithmic preferences) p0h / p0l = 1 , as the
two effects exactly offset each other.
Table 1 reports the value of p0h / p0l and confirms this observation for a
wide range of values of α and β .
This simple example illustrates that evaluating polices that affect
aggregate consumption based on their impact on asset values may not be a good
measure of the welfare consequences of the policies.

Evaluation of an GHG Abatement Policy
In this section, we evaluate a stylized abatement policy based on two

distinct measures: asset valuation and household welfare. We remind the reader
that in the integrated assessment models of the type analyzed by Stern (2007 and
2008) and Nordhaus (2008), the welfare consequences and asset valuations
depend only on the endogenous consumption process. The policy analyzed below
can be considered as a “reduced form” of an integrated assessment model with an
equivalent consumption process. The parameters we consider encompass a wide
variety of current policy recommendations. Pindyck (2011,2012) has forcefully
argued that abatement policies should be modeled as effecting the growth rate of
consumption rather than its level. This paper endorses this perspective and
expands on it.
We evaluate two alternative policies in an economy of the type analyzed
in Section 2 above:
a)

No abatement or intervention: in this scenario, per capita
consumption initially grows at the historical average rate of 2% for

9
T years. Thereafter, due to the effects of greenhouse gas emissions,
the growth rate slows down to 1% and remains at that level in
perpetuity12. The reasons for this slow-down cited in the literature
include: conflicts, pandemics, large scale flooding and the
consequent migration of a vast number of people.

b)

An abatement policy, which requires investment in carbon
abatement technologies for T years, resulting in a reduction in
current per capita consumption by x % per year during the
investment period. This investment is in addition to the normal
investment required for a 2% growth (in the absence of GHG
emissions). However, as a result of the abatement the growth rate
remains constant at 2% indefinitely.

Figure 1 illustrates the per capita consumption path over time in the two
cases.

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
12

The results will not change if instead of a reduction in perpetuity, the reduction was for, say,
100 - 150 years. The present value of a long annuity is well approximated by a perpetuity for the
discount rates considered in Table 2.

We compute the present value of land and the lifetime consumption
equivalents (defined below) with and without abatement for a range of the
parameters α , β , and g . As shown in Table 2 these parameter values encompass
a wide range of discount rates r defined in equation 5.

11
We reiterate that the land entitles the owner to the entire future consumption
∞
stream {cs }s=t+1
and hence its price is equal to the present value of this
consumption stream, valued at the endogenous interest rate. To compute the
present value of land with no abatement, p0na , we modify equation 2 to account
for the decrease in growth rate after time T.

Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 first report the values of p0a / p0wa for a range of the
parameters α ∈ {1, 2, 3} , β ∈ {0.98, 0.99, 0.999,1.01} , x ∈ {1%, 2%, 3%} 	  13and

T ∈ {50,100,150,∞} (the caseT = ∞ serves as a consistency check).
While utility is a monotonic transformation of consumption, this
transformation is usually nonlinear. The present value of consumption is not the
same as the present value of lifetime utility and in general, is not the correct
measure of welfare.
While the various integrated assessment models do base their calculations

global energy system. See DeCanio and Fremstad (2011).

12
on the maximization of lifetime utility, abatement and non-abatement in these
models effect the levels rather than the growth rates of consumption as in our
analysis. This explains why our conclusions are different from these models.
To calculate the welfare impact of the different polices, we compute the
lifetime consumption equivalents14 as in Lucas (1987). Using the no abatement
policy as the base, this is the fraction of consumption that would make a
household indifferent between the two policies.

The astute reader would have noticed that we cannot take the ratio of lifetime utility of
consumption to evaluate policies. For instance a utility of -30 > -50 but 3/5 is less than 1. Nor is
the magnitude of the differences in utility an indicator of a quantitative welfare improvement, as
utility functions can be arbitrarily scaled without changing the preference orderings. Computing
lifetime consumption equivalents makes it possible to make quantitative assessments for a
homogenous class of households.

13
If we equate U 0wa (λ) to U 0na and solve for λ , we get the fraction by which
consumption under abatement must be increased or decreased to make the
household indifferent to the no abatement policy.

For the values of the parameters α and β considered in tables 3, 4, 5, 6
and 7, if T=50 years, a policy maker would not choose the abatement policy
based on market valuation even though it is welfare enhancing in each instance.
The lifetime consumption equivalents are negative. Households are willing to
sacrifice consumption, in addition to that required by the abatement policy, to
avoid a reduction in future growth rates.
A striking result of this analysis is that the policy recommendations are robust
across a wide range of discount rates ranging from 3% to 6%. Abatement is
always welfare enhancing if T=50 years, while it is almost neutral in terms of
lifetime consumption equivalents even if T=100 years. This is in sharp contrast
to conventional wisdom15 and to the differing recommendations in Stern (2008)
and Nordhaus (2008).
We reiterate, that the underlying debate should not be about which
discount rate to use16 in evaluating alternative policies, but rather on the effect of
the policies on the growth rate of the economy. The discount rate is endogenous.
It has been argued in the environmental literature that the welfare of
future generations should not be valued less than that of the present generation17.
In our view, inter generational discounting is an ethical issue to which economic
theory provides little guidance18. In table 7 we consider a case with β > 1 ; its
conclusions are consistent with our earlier observations -- there is no striking
difference between tables 3-6 and table 7.

See Weitzman (2007).“The biggest uncertainty of all in the economics of climate change is the
uncertainty about which interest rate to use for discounting”.
16
There is a vast literature addressing this issue. A representative sampling includes: Arrow et al
(1996), Burgess and Zerbe (2011), Dasgupta (2008), Heal (1997), Kaplow, Moyer and
Weisbach(2010), Pindyck (2007), Samida and Weisbach (2007), Gollier (2009), Weitzman (1998,
2007), Weisbach and Sunstein (2008).

This position is supported by Broome (2008), Cline (2006), Cowen (2007), Dasgupta (2008),
Heal (2009), Philibert (1999), Rawls (1999), Ramsey (1931) and Sidgwick (1890) among others.
See the review by Revesz and Shahabian (2011).
18
In contrast, for intra generational discounting, a plausible case can be made for β < 1 . See
Arrow (1999) or Blanchard (1985).

20
Given that the integrated assessment models abstract from a positive
feedback induced catastrophe, our analysis favors a policy of abatement as an
inexpensive (in terms of lifetime consumption equivalents) insurance policy, given
the present modeling perspective19.
This recommendation may be strengthened in a model that incorporates
endogenous technological change and substitution between technologies that will
be an inevitable consequence of relative prices changes in the factors of
production.
We hasten to add that we are not taking a stand on the type of abatement
investment and the conclusions of our analysis do not depend on this. It may well
be the case that increased investment for R&D in abatement technology today
and then the use of this more efficient technology for abatement in the future
may be more effective in curtailing greenhouse emissions than with existing
technology.

Household Heterogeneity
Most of the climate literature assumes a “global representative household”.

The reality, however, is that there is significant household heterogeneity across
the globe. Large parts of the population in India, China and sub-Saharan Africa
live at or near subsistence levels of consumption. This group accounts for about a
third of global households, and their willingness to substitute consumption over
time is arguably different from that of households in more developed economies.
Lending rates for poorer households are, very likely, much higher than those
implied by capital market data.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
19

If, as shown above, abatement is approximately welfare neutral in models that abstracts from
catastrophic risk, it will be welfare enhancing if we include and price this risk. The increase in
welfare arises because abatement offers the benefits of a put option that we have not included.

21
To illustrate this, consider a preference function of the form:

(c
u(c ,c ) =

t

t

1−α

−c )

−1

(10)

1− α

where c is the subsistence level of consumption. For these preferences the
relative risk aversion is:

−ctu ′′(ct )
α
=
.
u ′(ct )
(1 −c ct )

(11)

Rich households have consumption levels well above subsistence levels and c /ct
for this class of households is likely to be small and their risk aversion with be
approximately equal to α . Poor households on the other hand are likely to have
consumption levels closer to subsistence levels and the household’s effective (or
local) risk aversion becomes very large. For example, if α = 2 and c /ct ≈ 0.9
then the effective risk aversion of these households ≈ 20!
How does one deal with household heterogeneity20? Unfortunately, as is
well known, a social welfare function cannot be constructed in general if
household preferences are heterogeneous. If the heterogeneous households have
preferences that satisfy the conditions for aggregation21, then a representative
agent can be constructed in a manner that is independent of the underlying
heterogeneous agent economy’s initial wealth distribution. Although aggregation
permits the use of the representative agent for welfare comparisons, it
substantially narrows the choice of utility functions. While the CRRA preferences

Households need to have common homothetic preferences. See Acemoglu (2008) chapter 5.

22
considered in this paper satisfy the conditions for aggregation, Epstein-Zin
preferences do not22. Any welfare analysis using the later preference class is
effectively based on the preferences of a “global dictator”. Even if preferences are
of the CRRA form there is no general closed form representation that relates the
heterogeneity in α at the household level to the curvature of the representative
agent.
Economists can evaluate the impact of a policy on the welfare of each
heterogeneous class of agents. Weighing the interests of different classes is an
ethical issue and in general is outside the scope of economics.

5.

Conclusion
This paper illustrates that even in a homogenous agent economy, using

social discount rates for evaluating alternative abatement policies on the basis of
its effects on asset valuation may not be welfare enhancing when these policies
affect the growth rate of consumption.
We show that the class of abatement polices considered in the integrated
assessment literature are robust with respect to the choice of a discount factor if
lifetime consumption equivalents are used as a metric.
We argue against a global welfare function in the presence of significant
global household heterogeneity. While economic analysis is a useful tool for
evaluating different policies for a homogenous class of households, inter household
comparisons are an ethical issue.
