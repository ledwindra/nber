    "abstract": "\n\nWhile incentive schemes to elicit greater effort in organizations are widespread, the incentive strength-effort mapping is difficult to ascertain in practice, hindering incentive design.  We propose a new semi-parametric method for uncovering this relationship in an education context, using exogenous incentive variation and rich administrative data.  The estimated effort response forms the basis of a counterfactual approach tracing the effects of various accountability systems on the full distribution of scores.  We show higher average performance comes with greater score dispersion for a given accountability scheme, and that incentive designs not yet enacted can improve performance further, relevant to education reform.\n\n",
