A Competitive Theory of Monopoly Unionism

ABSTRACT

This paper sets up a microeconomic theory of labor unions. It dis—

cusses their formation and goals, their hierarchical structure, and the
nature

of rent distribution. The theory provides predictions for the

probability that an industry or occupation will be unionized, the proportion
of that industry that will be unionized, and observed wage differentials

within that industry. It discusses the way that those values change in
response to changes in the supply of labor, demand for labor, cost of

organizing the union, and cost of defeating the union. Institutions such
as featherbedding, fringe benefits, and seniority are rationalized in this

framework. The model is consistent with competitive factor and product
markets.

a

micro-level approach and I will argue that one can go surprisingly far

toward the analysis of union behavior by employing a simple model where
workers and firms are the rational basic unit.

The goal is to predict which industries, occupations and time periods are

most likely tobe characterized by strong unions and to analyze the behavior

in an industry are unionized, but union and nonunion firms

sell the same product in an often competitive product market, then firms face

different labor costs. How can they coexist selling the product at the same
price? Third, given the highly hierarchical nature of most unions where

2

seniority

plays a major role, why don't the least priviledged workers within

the union join forces with nonunion workers to undermine the power of the

union? In particular, the young workers could form their own union making
employers and themselves apparently better off while destroying any union

ecuilibrium. Why doesn't this happen more often? Finally, few models (Rosen

l969 s an exception) allow the firm to play an active role. In most, the
labor demand curve is taken as given, and the union selects some wage which is

consistent with maximizing its objective function. There is no allowance by
the union, or the analyses in general, for the possibility that the firm will
react differently to different wage demands except as expressed by labor
demand.

This paper starts from utility and profit maximization by worker and firm
respectively and builds a model which deals with these issues explicitly.

Labor markets clear in the sense that anyone can enter the industry and claim

a nonunion job, but there are queues for union jobs. The length of the oueue
is the direct result of union and firm behavior and the union takes this into

account when announcing its wage demand. The product market clears as the

Product markets are competitive, and the equilibrium that emerges is a welldefined blend of competitive and

monopoly, not unlike the dominant-firm-with-

competitive fringe equilibrium found in the industrial organization

literature. This simple structure yields a stable equilibrium which varies in
unambiguous directions as the relevant observable parameters are altered.

results in a smaller likelihood of a union, and a smaller proportion of union

differential. Also, as a corollary, as the attrition rate rises, the

The sense of the U—shaped indifference curve is this: Workers would like
both higher

W implies lower P .

Initially,

the value of an increase in W outweighs

the loss associated with a reduction in P so indifference curves are

negatively sloped. As W gets large and P gets small, however, the
benefits to increased W are swamped by the loss resulting from a

decreased P and workers view additional W as a bad, yielding positively
sloped indifference curves.

Equilibrium:

Define the "critical indifference curve" as the one that yields the same

utility as the competitive equilibrium. Using (7), the critical indifference

curve is the one that has K =

A union equilibrium exists with certainty if the critical indifference curve
crosses the opportunity locus, since this implies that there exists some

feasible W, W, P combination which yields an expected utility level higher
than the one offered by competition. In figure 2, if IC0 were the critical
indifference curve, then a union equilibrium would exist. It need not exist,

however. If Z were very large, for example, so that it is expensive to run
the union, an equilibrium is unlikely to exist. Although the critical
indifference curve and opportunity locus both asymptote to W,..

Finally, in this one—period context, no difficulty arises with respect to

workers might wish

to behave

differently once they realize that they have won the lottery, this is not
permitted by the one—period framework. Below, in the rrtultiperiod context,

discrepancies between ex ante and ex post winners and losers are resolved by

assigning workers to the union on an age or seniority basis. The union jobs

15

will always go to the older workers first so that over one's lifetime, each
worker expects to be a loser at some time and a winner at others.

A key point is that even if ex post losers would like to bid with ex post

winners for the union jobs, they are precluded from doing so. The firm can
entertain these offers as a way to beat the union. As such, it carries with

distribution of costs of defeating the union.

This model does not permit firms to costlessly accept the labor offer of a

scab. Even in the absence of NLRB rules, it seems reasonable to view the
hiring of scabs as carrying some real costs, perhaps larger to some firms than
others.

A Note on Labor rket Equilibrium:
The labor market clears in the sense that aggregate supply of labor

equals aggregate demand. Workers prefer the union jobs and in a multiperiod
context (below) queue for them.

3it this market permits workers to enter the

occupation in accordance with their own labor supply optimization and no

artificial supply restrictions are required. The wage in the nonunion sector
adjusts to clear the market which allows free entry.

Incidentally, herein lies the difference between this model and the
dominant firm construct found in the industrial organization literature (see

Cohen and Cyert (1975) and rlton (1979), for examples). First, dominant
firms, by restricting their supply insure that their own profits are maximized

and second, commodities trade at the same price. In this model, the union
does not have any power over the labor supply function and the wage in the

nonunion sector lie below the union wage. Firms, unlike customers, are not
permitted costlessly to buy from the lowest price sellers of labor.

II. Extensions and Implications of the del
The Supply of Labor:
For expositional convenience, we assumed that the supply of labor to the

occupation or industry was perfectly inelastic. In this section we relax that
assumption, allowing the labor force to be responsive to the actions of the

union. An individual considers the expected utility from work in an
occupation and compares it to the alternatives. By definition, if a union
organizes an occupation, it does so because the expected utility of each

member rises. Therefore let R , the number of workers in the occupation be

given by R(K) where K , defined in (6), is the expected utility of entering
the occupation and R'(K) > 0 .

As the expected wage in the occupation rises,

those whose comoarative advantage previously lay elsewhere, are now induced to
acquire the requisite skills for this occupation.

The main result is that a union is less likely to exist as the supply of

labor becomes more elastic. tchanically, this is because the opportunity
locus shifts downward and the critical indifference curve shifts upward making

an intersection of these curves less likely. The proof of these propositions

is contained in appendix A. The intuition behind it is this: When the supply
of labor is elastic, choosing a higher—than—competitive union wage induces

more workers into the industry. As the result, the wage in the nonunion
sector must fall more in order for nonunion firms to take up this larger

residual labor force. This forces the opportunity locus downward. Similarly,
since the probability that a given worker will obtain a union job is lower the

more workers there are in the industry, a worker requires a higher nonunion
wage for a given union wage to obtain the same level of expected utility.

Thus, the critical indifference curve or the xninimn combination of (W1 wN)
which the worker views as preferable to the competitive wage, W ,

rises,

making a union equilibrium less likely.

At the extreme, the supply of labor to the occupation could be perfectly

elastic. This requires a particular kind of homogeneity in ability so that no
workers are relatively better at some occupations than others. Under these
circumstances, no union equilibriu exists because raising the expected wage

above W brings about an infinite sized labor force so that the probability
of obtaining a union job falls to zero and all workers prefer the competitive

wage. To the extent that the union can restrict entry into the occupation, it
gives some inelasticity to the labor supply curve and we are back to the case
just analyzed.

This may be the difference between unions organized along craft

(occupational) lines and those organized along industrial lines. To the
extent that the long run supply of labor to an occupation is more inelastic

than to an industry, unions are more likely to be successful in crafts. As

long as it is easier for an individual to switch from industry i to j

than

it is for him to switch from occupation k to h , the proposition holds.
Heterogeneity in talents across occupations makes this feasible, even for long

run labor supply. Historically, craft unions were organized before industrial
unions and there is some evidence (see Lewis (1963), Rees (1962)) that the
former have been more successful than the latter.

The Demand for Labor:

Let us begin this section on a negative note: Although there are a
number of statements that can be made about how the demand for labor affects

18

union behavior, excluded from that set is the traditional (a la arshall,
Pigou, Hicks) and intuitive claim that unions have more power and are more

likely to be successful the more inelastic is the demand for labor. The
reason is quite simple. Although it is true that a given wage increase
displaces a smaller number of union workers the more inelastic is the demand
for labor, a given number of displaced workers drives down the nonunion wage

by more, the more inelastic is the demand for labor. These spillovers must be
absorbed by a nonunion sector finn with that same inelastic labor demand,

implying that the wage rate in nonunion jobs must fall by more. This reduces
the expected wage at the same time that the inelasticity increases it via

higher union wages. The net effect is ambiguous, but in some cases, the
effects are exactly offsetting so that inelasticity of labor demand does not
affect the equilibrum.

Surprisingly, what is crucial is convexity of the demand curve. As the
demand for labor becomes more convex, a given increase in the union wage

results in a smaller displacement of workers. Also,
becomes more convex, a

shifts upward, i.e., for a given union wage, a higher nonunion wage is

available. similarly, since the probability of obtaining a union job rises
with the convexity of the labor demand curve,

workers

are as well off as

before with a lower nonunion wage. Thus the critical indifference curve
shifts down, i.e., at a given union wage, a lower nonunion wage is

acceptable. th of these forces increase the probability of obtaining a
union

equilibrium.7 The proof of this proposition is contained in the last

section of appendix 2.

19

n increase in the demand for labor can have almost any effect depending
upon the shape of the new demand curve relative to the old. However, in the
simple case where demand curves are linear and the increase takes the form of
a parallel shift, there will be no effect on the probability of obtaining a

union equilibrimi nor on the union—nonunion wage differential. The formal
proof is contained in the first part of appendix 2. This suggests that
business cycle variations in union behavior and results are not caused by

difference in the demand for labor per se. Findings such as those by Freeman

(1980), doff (1979), and Blau and Kahn (1980) that union employment is more
procyclic than nonunion employment must rely on inter-industry or
interoccupational differences in product cyclical sensitivity for their
explanation.8
Demand for Product:

These results suggests that the analyses of b.rshall, Ricks, and Pigou

are based on an inappropriate assumption. They argued that the more inelastic
is the demand for labor, the more likely it is that unions raise wage. They
proceed to discuss the conditions under which the demand for labor will be

more inelastic. In the last section, we showed that the premise on which

their analysis is based may be false. Yet, one of rshall's implications,
that union power increases with the inelasticity of product demand, holds.

This is not because of the relationship between inelasticity of product and

labor demands, but because of the relationship between ine1asticiy of product
demand and convexity of labor demand.

The more inelastic is product demand, the more convex is the relevant

labor demand curve. To see this, consider a firm which produces with labor

plus one manager. In competitive equilibrin, the output price, P

But the increase in the wage to W shifts the average cost

curve upward. If all firms were unionized, this would raise the equilibrium
price of output, PQ .

But even if all firms are not unionized, this must

happen. Since this move raises the value of a "union buster," the salary of
the manager in the nonunion firm is bid up to the point where the minimum of
the

average cost in the nonunion firm equals that in the union firm. (Because

rather than 10 of labor. Similarly, nonunion

firms employ 12 of labor and WN is the solution to equation (1). The

relevant demand for labor curve is then AB for union firms and BC for
nonunion firms which adds convexity to the demand for labor. Further, the
more inelastic is the demand for output, the larger is the increase in price

which makes the labor demand even more convex. But as argued above,

However,

Nationals and Locals:
The discussion has been in the context of a union selecting a wage for

the entire industry or occupation. Thus, bargaining takes place at the

23

"national" level where "national" is defined as the market over which workers

are perfect substitutes. Now consider another possibility. Start with a
competitive industry and allow each firm's R,/S workers to vote separately on
whether or not that firm

wage. The result is that locals do not maxirrLize

that wage setting should occur at the national level. This implication is not
new, but the usual reason for it relies on the relationship between bargaining

power and union worker solidarity. This is not what is operating here.
Because one local union's behavior affects market price and the aggregate

probability that a worker obtains a union job in a way different from that

perceived by the local, an inferior solution results. Fzther, it is novel
that the local sometimes establishes a wage rate that is too low rather than
too high.

Threat fect and the asurement of Union Power:
Researchers have worried that the observed union differential may
understate the true effect of the union on wage rates because nonunion firms,
in attempting to discourage their workers from becoming unionized, pay more

than the competitive wage.10 As the result of the spillovers into the

nonunion sector, however, it is kno that the effect may well go on the other
way. Novel is that the understatement or overstatement of the true
differential bears a particular relationship to the proport±on in the union.

Let us continue to think of C as being resources spent to hire a union
buster or bribe a vote counter. Consider figure 1. At any given wage rate,

observed wage differential, however, is W —

The

between the 45° line and the opportunity locus. Since CL is everywhere

below W , the observed differential overstates rather than understates the
true effect of the union on wage rates. This is because the effect of a union
is to depress the nonunion wage. Farther, since the difference between

the overstatement of

28

crucial here, of course, is the assumption that C does not become part

of the observed wage. Thinking of C as salary to a union buster, a bribe
for an official or even "bribes" to workers as long as these take non-

pecuniary wage forms, is consistant with this. However, the standard "threat

effect" approach views C as wages paid to nonunion workers to keep them

from joining a union. It is clear, however, that even if C1 were
reinterpreted as wages paid to discourage unions, for some firms, W — W
would overstate the effect of the union, and the average WV

Let

us ask a more fundamental cuestion. If the model in this paper is a

reasonable description of equilibrii in a unionized industry, what can we

infer from looking at the wage dferential and its relationship to other
variables, especially the uroportion unionized? At the risk of restating a
point made by Rosen (1974) in another context, consider the following. The

observed WV W pair is the outcome of solving the unions optimt problem.
As one moves from left to right along a given opportunity locus, W —

rises

and P falls yet union "power" in the sense of opportunities stays the

same.

Suppose that all unions faced the same opportunity locus and differed

only on z , the costs of running a union. Recall that as Z rises, the

optimal W rises and P falls. So occupations for which the costs of
running a union are

high

will have high wage differentials and few union

workers. From the low P , some might infer that the union is not powerful.

From the high W —

WN

,

others

might infer that it has a great deal of

power. In fact, in some sense "power" is the same across occupations because

the opportunity locus is unchanged. In another sense, the high Z occupation
is less powerful since its costs are higher and expected wealth is lower so

29

that union power and proportion in the union are negatively related. Finally,
a regression of

WN

on P will yield a negative coefficient! If the

opportunity locus shifts as well across occupations, then the interpretation

of the relationship between W -

and the proportion in the union is even

more confused. This is not to imply that studies such as the classic by Lewis
(1963) or that by Rosen (1970) on wage differentials tell nothing. They
describe empirical regularities which models like this one should be able to

explain. 8t inferences drawn with respect to union power on the basis of
such studies, might usefully be reexamined in light of such thinking.11

Quantity strictions and Price Discrimination:
In this seciton, we allow the union to select from a richer strategy

set. Above, it was assumed that the union as monopolist could choose only the

wage, W .

However the dead weight loss which results can be eliminated and

additional rent can be captured by the union if we allow price discrimination
or if we allow the union to set quantity as well as price by offering all—or

nothing contracts. This is illustrated in figure 4.
A monopolistic union can extract more rent than it can by simply charging
the monopoly price, say

and allowing the firm to hire 1' =

d(Wu)

workers. The union can extract up to triangle ABC in an infinite number of

ways. One is to offer the firm an all-or-nothing contract to employ PJS

workers (the competitive number) at wage W each (where area F equals area
DEE). Alternatively, the union could require that the unionized firm pay
lump sum to the union equal to area ABC. The wage rate is then free to settle

to the competitive level WC , and firms voluntarily hire P/S workers. This
lump sum payment is then redistributed to workers who end up earnings

as

the result. The lump sum is payment to workers may take the form of fringe
benefits which are paid to workers, but are invariant with respect to number

30

of hours worked. The finding by Freeman '1978), that union workers receive a
higher proportion, and therefore higher absolute amount, of compensation as
fringes can be explained as part of an optimal rent extracting policy.

The advantage of the two—part wage scheme is that since the marginal wage
is free to adjust, transitory changes in supply of and demand for labor are
dealt with efficiently. The ni.mtber of workers employed adapts automatically

to the new competitive equilibrium. The all—or—nothing contract requires
explicit changes in the number of workers by the union. Adjustments made by
the union are more efficient if most supply or demand changes are known by the

union better than the firm. If not, the two-part wage which allows the firm
to select the number of workers is superior. This point, best articulated by
Hall and Lilien (1979), should be coupled with another: To the extent that
the lump sum transfer to the union involves the union as a intermediary,

workers may prefer to avoid the possibility of skimming by the union leader

through payments which come directly to workers. In a world of perfect
information with respect to changes in supply and demand, this would tip the

balance in favor of all—or—nothing offers. Since calling out a marginal wage
necessarily implies a quantity, we conduct the following discussion in terms
of the all—or-nothing offer.

It is obvious that if the firm is held captive so that it faces no

III. An

Overlapping—Generation del

The analysis has been a static one where all workers were assumed to be

identical. Yet the essence of a great deal of union activity centers on
worker differences and how different preferences within the union are juggled

to come out with a stable, long term, relationship. Among the most important
sources of different preferences within the union are those related to the

lifecycle. Old and young workers may have very different ideas about what the
union should do and one wonders, for example, why such a situation does not
result in one group forming its own

union in competition with the other. This

section proves that the multi—generational feature does not change the way in
which a union behaves with respect to those issues discussed in previous
sections.

What is essential about lifecycle differences within a union can be

captured by a simple overlapping generation model. Assume

that

workers live

two periods. There are Y young persons born into the occupation each period

so that R B

2Y

is the total labor supply. All workers are equally

productive.

Recall that P is the proportion of workers who obtain union jobs.
Before, allocation of jobs was assumed to be random. 3t in a two generation
context the way in which jobs are assigned makes a great deal of difference.
Suppose that all young workers had first claim to union jobs.

If P is less

than one, there will be some old workers without union jobs. They have an
incentive to negotiate with the union employer, offering labor services at a

wage which exceeds the nonunion wage, but is less than the union wage. The
union may or may not successfully defeat such attempts at "scabbing" by older
workers, but the presence of such incentives clearly raises the costs of

operating the union, z

, and

makes a union equilibrium less likely.

34

Reverse the situation. Let old workers have first claim to union jobs
and the scenario is altered dramatically. Young workers, who care only about
expected lifetime wealth, behave no differently. They remain loyal to the
union, even as nonunion workers, because their entry into union jobs can be

made contingent upon their non—disruptive behavior. Old workers, however,
have no incentive to undermine the union since they are the individuals who

reap the current benefits of such a scheme. As the result, no individual's ex
ante lifetime wealth is reduced by a strict seniority rule for admission to
the union, and the costs of operating the union are reduced, which results in

a higher expected lifetime wealth for all workers. Thus, union workers will
tend to be older than nonunion workers. Further, if there were retired
workers present in the model, they too might desire to work occasionally and

their offers of labor at less than W to union firms would also adversely
affect expected wealth. However, if these workers can be punished for this
anti—union behavior, all workers can be made better off ex ante. Pensions may
play an important role here. To the extent that old workers receive large
pensions which are controlled at least in part by the union, scabbing can be

punished by the discontinuation of pension benefits. (A union may

not

be able

to stop pension payments to workers, but its ability to raise the uncertainty
of receiving those payments has a similar, though somewhat weaker effect.)

This provides another reason why union workers should receive a greater part
of their lifetime compensation in the form of pensions that nonunion

workers.12 Mincer (1981) also suggests that pensions are a way to capture
rents and lessen the adverse affects of the hours reduction.

"Featherbedding" too can be rationalized along these same lines. Even
featherbedding which involves inefficiency and is inferior to lump sum

payoff s,

has the advantage that the "bought out" individual's payment is tied

35

to the UfljOfltS continued success. A bought out worker would otherwise have an

incentive to undermine the union after his payoff was received.

A word on the mechanics of this market is useful. Here, young workers
play a role even though they may not be in the union. Young workers'
cooperation is necessary, yet they appear as nonunion workers in this

market. In some situations, workers in nonunion firms may be in the union

explicitly. This is extremely conon in the building trades. A worker may
have his union card, but is assigned to union jobs in an order often related

to seniority. If he does not obtain a union job on a given day, he may work
in a nonunion job at a lower wage, but obviously cannot offer his services to

the union employer. His willingness to do this rests on his knowledge that

someday he will be the more senior worker and will receive W
In other situations, the young worker actually is outside the union,

waiting for his union card. During this period, he works nonunion jobs. Yet
even this worker prefers that the occupation is unionized, because his

lifetime wealth is higher as a result. irther, his cooperation is necessary
in order for the union to be successful in pressing its demands.

All of this implies that the probability of being in a union job will be

positively related to age in the following manner; If P0 is the probability
that an old worker will be in a union and P.r,

is the probability that a young

worker will be in a union, then

so that an increase in the average age of the relevant labor pool will

increase the average age of both union and nonunion workers. However, for a

given P , an increase in A0 and A which is neutral in the sense that it
leaves A3-A unchange will also leave A_AN unchanged. This follows
directly from (27). These relationships are also empirically verifiable in
the sense that they give definite predictions on the relationship between the
age structure of an occupation and the age structure between union and
nonunion workers within that occupation.14
Attrition
Some occupations are characterized by a. more fickle labor force than

others. Occupations with high turnover or attrition rates present additional
difficulties for the prospective union. First, such movement makes it more
difficult

to

keep

which workers "paid their dues" when young by

accepting a nonunion job without

attempting to bargain away

more senior worker. This factor by itself raises Z ,

a union job from a

the costs of operating

a union. As such, it will reduce the likelihood of a union ecuilibrium, but
will raise the wage differential and lower the proportion of union workers in

those occupations where a union equilibrium is obtained. This suggest that
occupations such as secretaries and farm workers where mobility into and out
of the labor force or between geographical regions is high are less likely to
be unionized. It also suggests that in 'nigh attrition occupations where
unions are formed, e. g., the California farm workers, only a small proportion

of workers will be employed by unionized firms and the union—nonunion wage
differential will be large.

Additionally, increased attrition, to the extent that it reflects ex

ante

known individual differences, makes a union equilibrium less likely even if it

does not affect Z .

The reason is that an individual who plans to leave the

This poses

only a single
the solution, which
for

43

reflects

the preference of the young worker, is identical to that in the

single period world. Therefore, all results of that section hold.
Age Earnings Profiles:

Given the way that the union is structured so that young

workers

are less

likely to be unionized than are old workers, there is a natural tendency for
wages to grow over the lifecycle as workers move from nonunion to union

jobs. This is true even if productivity does not grow over the lifecycle.

re important, is that within a union firm, age—earnings profiles will
be flatter than

they

are in nonunion firms. The reason is that unions, in

order to maintain stability, want the old rather than young workers to receive

the benefits of the union. ait in most industries and occupations, the firm,

rather

than the union, hires workers. A way by which the union can discourage

the finn from hiring young workers is to overprice them relative to more

experienced workers. This will provide the firm with incentives to hire the
workers into the union firm which the union would have selected. Thus, the
union can implicitly control hiring and the compensation of the firms' work
force simply by calling out the appropriate wages.

A corollary is that if age and skill are positively correlated, higher
quality

labor will be found in union

firms. Union firms, faced with flatter

age—earnings voluntarily select the older highly skilled workers, because they
are underpriced relative to the younger, less skilled workers. An alternative
is provided by Mincer (1981) who cites evidence that less on—the-job training

occurs in union firms. There is no obvious theoretical reason why this should
be the case.

Incidentally, if the bimodal age distribution is replaced by a continuous

one, nothing is altered fundamentally but P is reinterpreted as the
proportion of one's life spent in the union. Incentives remain intact and all

44

conclusions still follow. ( course, the formulas for the average ages of
workers in union and

nonunion

jobs would require alteration.)

Countercyclical Variations in wage Differentials:
Lewis reports that union

workers

do relatively better during cyclical

downturns. The age—based incentive mechanism provides an explanation. Since
incentive compatibility requires that old workers in unions receive benefits
relative to young, we expect that seniority will be more important in

determining layoff priority in union firms. As such, the average age of union
workers relative to nonunion workers should rise during cyclical downturns and
since age—earnings profiles are positively sloped, wage differentials will

increase. This is easily tested by examining the way in which AU_AN moves
over the business cycle. Also, controlling for age should eliminate most of
the couritercyclical wage differential movement.

subsumes all bargaining problems. Thus, Reder's (1952) notions of

fairness and Steven's (1958) early description of bargaining, as well as more
modern bargaining models (Farber (1978), Crawford (1979), Atherton (1973)) are
implied.

4Johnson and Miezkowski (1970) and Diewert (1974) offer alterntive two—

sector models of unionism. There, the union wage is exogenous and the purpose
is to trace various wage choices through the rest of the economy in a general

equilibrium framework. This model is interested in the way in which
spillovers affect the choice of a union

wage.

5This is a major break with the literature in that most of what has gone

before, attempts to limit

the

relevant population to some subset of

P. •

For

example, Reder (1959) focuses on "present members." But present at what point
in time? How does the union ever get started under these assumptions? Also,
Dertouzos and Pencavel estimate a wage and employment relationship using data

from

the International Typographical Union. This is not equivalent to my

indifference curve, however, because it abstracts from spillover effects of
on

and changes in the opportunity locus over time.

6Even in the pathological case where

g(0), Z ,

and

d(Wu) are

sufficiently large so that the indifference curve is initially positive, it
will rapidly become negative because when

7Stiglitz (1980) obtains a similar result in a different context.

He

shows that convexity affects whether a random taxation scheme dominates a
nonrandom one.

81n this context, Epple, Hotz and Zelenitz (1980) formalize the argument
that in high variance demand industries, the union performs a risk pooling

function which reduces the necessity of formal layoffs. The union acts as the
hiring hail and assigns workers accordingly. Fluctuation in an individual
firm's demand does not result in a "layoff," as the result.

9There are additional second—order effects. There is no guarantee that
the reduction in output by union firms plus the increase in output by nonunion
firms will yield the net reduction in total output required as we move up the

demand curve. This will require a change in S
in the industry.

work by Mincer (1981) makes a similar point, but exploits a

different mechanism. Mincer points out that altering the probability of
obtaining a job in the union sector affects the expected return to queuing for

jobs in that sector and affects spillovers to the nonunion sector. Depending

3

upon the nature of these spillovers, the observed wage differential may

overstate the true effect of unions. He, too, concludes that there is no
straightforward relationship between wage differentials and power. The main
difference between his approach and this one is that in this model queuing for
union jobs is done while holding a nonunion job so there is never any

unemployment. Mincer's queuing takes place while the worker is unemployed.

Young vote for the union if (30) holds, i.e., if

2Wc < (Wu_Z)(Py + Po)+WN[(l_Py)+(1_Po))

substituting in (19) and (20) this can be rewritten as

2Wc < (Wu_Z)(2P)+WNC2(1_P)]
or

which is the condition for a single—period lived worker to prefer the union
equilibrium (derivable from equation (12)).
