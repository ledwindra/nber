    "abstract": "\n\nResearch spanning several disciplines has repeatedly documented disproportionate pollution exposure in low-income communities and communities of color. Among the various proposed causes of this pattern, those that have received the most attention are income inequality, discrimination, and \ufb01rm costs (of inputs and regulatory compliance). We argue that an additional channel \u2013 information \u2013 is likely to play an important role in generating disparities in pollution exposure. We present multiple reasons for a tendency to underestimate pollution burdens. Using a model of housing choice, we then derive conditions under which \u201chidden\u201d pollution leads to an inequality \u2013 even when all households face the same lack of information. This inequality arises when households sort according to known pollution and other disamenities, which we show are positively correlated with hidden pollution. To help bridge the gap between environmental justice and economics, we discuss the relationship between hidden information and three di\ufb00erent distributional measures: exposure to pollution; exposure to hidden pollution; and welfare loss due to hidden pollution.\n\n",
