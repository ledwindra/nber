ABSTRACT
We provide a new model that generates persistent performance differences amongst seemingly similar
enterprises. Our model provides a mechanism whereby efficient incumbent rivals can give permission
for an inefficient firm to exist in the presence of efficient entrants. We demonstrate that, in a repeated
game, an efficient incumbent has a unilateral incentive to establish a relational contract that softens
price competition to either strengthen the inefficient firm in a war of attrition that emerges post-entry
or reduce the value to the inefficient firm of selling its position to entrants. The paper provides conditions
under which that equilibrium exists and derives a number of empirical predictions as implications
of the model. It is demonstrated that performance differences are likely to be associated with stability
in the identity of firms in the market.

Introduction

Perhaps one of the most developed empirical literatures in strategic management is that
detailing the strong evidence of persistent performance differences (PPDs) amongst
seemingly similar enterprises. Bartelsman and Doms (2000) summarised the literature
in the 20th century while Syverson (2011) documented that literature in the 21st. The
differences are significant, there are no identified common drivers (although Gibbons
and Henderson, 2013, offer an important claim for a managerial element). In opposition to a long-standing prediction from industrial economic theory, while impacted by
competition, PPDs are not eliminated by it (Syverson, 2004). Our goal in this paper is
to provide a new perspective in theoretically approaching this set of empirical puzzles
as well as a model illustrating that new perspective.
To date, theories designed to account for PPDs have focused on initial starting
conditions where differences between firms exist aiming to explain why competitive
processes have not eliminated those differences. The canonical case is of competing
firms in a market having different levels of productivity where the least efficient firms
should be vulnerable to one or both of two forces: displacement by expansion from the
efficient firms and/or displacement by entry from efficient firms (i.e., selection). As
Syverson (2011) shows, initial differences between firms can persist in markets where
(a) firms have natural limits on their size (say, due to diseconomies of scale) that
prevent expansion and (b) entry barriers are high. Both conditions are necessary to
allow differences to persist. If (a) did not hold, then efficient firms could expand and
drive out inefficient ones while if (b) did not hold, then new firms (or new plants) could
be created that mimic the processes of efficient firms.
To date, the theoretical literature has provided reasons why either (a) or (b) hold.
For instance, the literature on learning and dynamic capabilities demonstrates that
firms may be unable to expand to displace less efficient firms and may be bound by
issues of history (Gibbons and Henderson, 2013). By contrast, the resource based theory
of the firm, emphasises resources that incumbent firms hold that cannot be replicated
or acquired by entrants (Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991).
Here we want to take an approach that is complementary to existing theories but
that imposes the additional burden that (a) and (b) do not hold; specifically, a situation
where there are no barriers to expansion or barriers to entry preventing selection from
working to displace inefficient firms with efficient ones. These assumptions mean that
there are no fundamental constraints to efficient practices and resources being deployed
1

in the industry.1 However, that means that in order for an inefficient firm to continue
to operate, someone (and indeed, the ‘right’ someone) must give that firm permission
to exist.2
Who can give an inefficient firm permission to exist? The inefficient firm itself has
the incentive but permission requires the actions of someone external. Consumers in
the market have the ability to allow an inefficient firm to continue operating but, given
our assumption that neither (a) nor (b) hold, they have no incentive to do that as
they would benefit, in terms of lower prices, from being supplied only by efficient firms.
Another option is to consider the supply-side, but suppliers have no more incentive
than consumers to deal with inefficient firms in an otherwise flexible vertical chain.
That leaves the inefficient firm’s rivals as the only viable candidates participating in
the market3 to give it permission to exist.
A rich literature in antitrust economics (going back to Adam Smith) notes that rival
firms have every interest to assist in preserving weaker competitors over stronger ones.
Thus, from an incentive perspective, it is not difficult to imagine rivals wanting to give
an inefficient firm permission to exist. But do they have the ability to give effect to
that permission?4
In this paper, we provide a model where it is demonstrated that an efficient rival
in a market may be able to give an inefficient firm permission to exist when neither
(a) nor (b) hold (and, in fact, because of it). To sketch the mechanism, suppose
that, initially, there is both an inefficient and an efficient firm in a market and that
each engages in price competition (specifically, differentiated Bertrand competition) in
selling to consumers. There is an infinite pool of potential entrants who can operate
at the same productivity as the efficient firm. If interactions were not repeated, then
1

Makadok (1998) provides an empirical analysis of the money mutual fund industry that nominally
satisfies these conditions and finds that there are significant early mover advantages. Gans and Quiggin (2003) demonstrate that in the absence of entry barriers a size distribution of firms can emerge
when entrepreneurial ability is heterogeneous. Powell (2013) provides a model that emphasises the
interaction between the internal organisation of the firm – specifically, its ability to establish relational
performance contracts – and the competitive rents a firm earns in the market.
2
The perspective offered here is inspired by work in coalitional game theory where agents agree to
various trade relationships. A constraint on agreements is a notion of stability whereby agents must
agree to participate in trade both as individuals and as groups relative to alternative arrangements
that sub-groups might agree to. For more details see MacDonald and Ryall (2004).
3
Of course, it is possible that institutions or governments can give firms permission to exist, but
we leave that possibility aside here to be consistent with the path taken in the current strategic
management literature.

Excluding, of course, obvious violations of antitrust law and other mechanisms such as tacit collusion.

the inefficient firm would be displaced by an efficient entrant due to the effects of
price competition; that is, an efficient firm could enter with the same product as the
inefficient one and drive its sales to zero, causing exit. However, if interactions were
repeated, then the efficient incumbent could establish the following relational contract
with the inefficient firm: “I will maintain my price in competition with you sufficiently
high so that, should you face entry, you have a stronger incentive to outlast an efficient
entrant in the resulting war of attrition.” The idea is that the efficient firm softens
price competition to such an extent that the inefficient firm earns higher profits than
an efficient entrant would earn in long-run competition with the efficient incumbent.
As wars of attrition involve losses, that will deter entry by efficient entrants and leave
firms of different efficiencies in the market.
This describes the mechanism but, in what follows, there is more work to be done
to establish this as an equilibrium outcome. First, softening competition is potentially
costly to the efficient incumbent so we need to show that, despite these costs, an incumbent still has an incentive to implement the relational contract. Second, if an entrant
could co-exist with an inefficient firm, then the “offer” from the efficient incumbent
could not be made, so we need to find conditions under which the market is a natural
oligopoly (or in our case, a natural duopoly).5 Third, clearly, an explicit offer by one
firm to another would violate antitrust laws, so we must show that the offer can be
sustained as an equilibrium in an implicit or tacit form. Finally, to provide a complete
theory, we need to characterise incentives to become more or less efficient in the first
place so as to demonstrate that differences between firms can arise endogenously rather
than as a given initial condition.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we setup our baseline model involving
consumers on the Hotelling line where firms can either be located at one end or the
other. There, we describe the operation of wars of attrition for a place in the market
that occurs when more than two firms enter the market. We also assume, following
Byford and Gans (2014), that entrants can avoid that war and enter by acquiring an
incumbent firm. We analyse the negotiation that arises in that case. In Section 3,
we confine attention to strategies that are independent of history to demonstrate that
there exists an equilibrium of that game whereby an inefficient firm is replaced by an
efficient entrant as per the usual intuition for this market structure. Section 4 presents
the main proposition of the paper and establishes how the efficient incumbent can
5

A natural oligopoly arises where a market can only accommodate a certain number of firms relative
to demand when those firms have fixed costs or exogenous or endogenous (Sutton, 1991) sunk costs.

3

use a relational contract (of the form described above) to allow the inefficient firm to
persist in the market. We provide conditions under which this relational contract is
an equilibrium of our baseline model. We then conduct comparative statics on firm
performance and provide empirical implications arising from the model. Section 5 then
considers extensions including additional firms, relational contracts with predation and
other forms of competition. A final section concludes.

2

A duopoly market

To provide the simplest expression for our theory, we assume that the market is a natural
duopoly. This is a market where fixed costs are such that, in relation to demand, at
most two firms can profitably operate in the market at any one time. This setting is of
interest as it is a special case of the equilibrium outcome identified by Sutton (1991) in
his analysis of endogenous sunk costs. Here we assume that fixed costs are exogenous
but are such that the natural duopoly structure arises. Because of this feature, entry
into the market will only be successful if it (a) occurs via acquisition of an incumbent or
(b) results in an incumbent exiting the market. Below, we will explore the importance
of this assumption on market structure.

2.1

Market structure

To fix ideas, we consider spatial price competition on a Hotelling line of unit length.
Consumers in the market are a unit mass uniformly distributed along the line. We assume that each consumer demands a single unit of the good in each period. Consumers
value the good at an amount v and face a transport cost of t > 0 per unit travelled. In
order to ensure that the market is covered, it is assumed that v ≥ 5t.
At the outset, there are two firms present in the market: an efficient incumbent,
firm 1, and an inefficient incumbent, firm 2. To be sure, while our starting point here
is that there are intrinsic firm differences, following our main result in Section 4 below,
we will endogenise efficiency making firms symmetric at the outset, and demonstrate
that, in equilibrium, differences can emerge and, are sustained.
Firm 1 is located at the left end of the line and faces a constant marginal cost, c1 ,
that is normalised to 0. Firm 2, the inefficient incumbent, is located at the right end
of the line and faces a constant marginal cost of c2 ∈ (0, t). All active firms also incur
a common fixed cost of C > 0 in each period, and discount the future by the common

The market is open to entry by firms outside of the market. Initially, firm 3 exists as
a potential entrant. Should firm 3 ever enter the market, a new firm, firm 4, emerges as a
potential entrant and so on. Thus, the pool of potential entrants is infinite. We assume
that entrants have access to the same efficient technology and practices employed by
firm 1 and as such ci = 0 for i ∈ {3, 4, . . . }.

2.2

Timing

We model competition in the natural duopoly market as an infinite-horizon dynamic
game. The timing of the game is illustrated in Figure 1.
Each period of the game begins with the participation stage. In this stage, the
potential entrant chooses between three alternatives: (1) enter the market de novo, (2)
attempt entry by acquisition, or (3) wait for the next period.
De novo entry requires a firm to construct a new set of production facilities in the
market. This costs the entrant an amount K > 0. We assume that the entrant must
locate its new facilities at either end of the line.7
6

While we model firm differences here as being with regard to their marginal production costs, the
model could accommodate other differences. For instance, firm 1 may have higher product quality
than firm 2 with v1 > v2 for all consumers. The outcomes here would be identical to the case where
c1 < c2 .
7
For example, we might assume that planning restrictions prevent a firm from locating in a residential area, and that the available sites are on the edge of town. An immediate consequence of this
assumption is that de novo entry, if it occurs, must result in the entrant collocating with one or other
of the incumbent firms.

5

If instead, the firm attempts entry by acquisition, it must nominate the incumbent
it wishes to acquire, and negotiate a fee for the purchase of the incumbent’s assets. We
do not explicitly model the bargaining process in this paper. Rather, we assume that
if the value of the incumbent’s assets to the entrant is greater than the value of these
assets to their current owners, a transaction will occur for a fee F that is acceptable
to both parties. In addition to the fee paid to the owners of the incumbent firm, the
entrant also incurs a transaction cost k > 0. The cost k can be understood as the cost
of conducting due diligence, replacing outdated technology and restructuring the firm.
If neither of these options is attractive to the potential entrant, then it may choose
to do nothing in the current period. Note that exercising this option does not prevent
the firm from attempting entry in a future period.
After the potential entrant has selected its action, the incumbent firms have the
opportunity to exit the market. We assume that exit is costless (i.e., a firm can always
declare bankruptcy) and irrevocable.
The participation stage is followed by the market stage. In the market stage the
firms that are active in the market simultaneously select their prices. Consumers then
make their purchases and profits are realised.

2.3

Wars of attrition

It is useful to distinguish between two phases of the game, depending on whether there
are two or three firms active in the market. We say that the game is in a duopoly phase if
at most one firm is present at each end of the line. During a duopoly phase, competition
between firms is subdued because consumers prefer to purchase from nearby firms. In
contrast, the game is said to be in a war of attrition if two or more firms are collocated at
one end of the line. During a war of attrition, competition is more intense as consumers
choose between the products of collocated firms on the basis of price alone.
Given this, we state a key assumption for our analysis.

(1)

First, for the equilibrium in the market to be a natural duopoly, the fixed costs of
operating in the market cannot be too low. Here, the lower bound on C is the profit
an efficient entrant earns if it collocates with firm 2 and sets a price that is (slightly
less than) firm 2’s marginal cost. Second, if the fixed costs of operating in the market

6

are too high, the market will become a natural monopoly rather than duopoly. Thus,
we assume an upper bound on C so that the market supports two firms.8
A war of attrition arises naturally in our setting. In each period, each firm chooses
whether to remain in the market or not for another period. If the firms remain, they
compete on price at an intensity dictated by their location (and, as we will see below,
potentially, the history of other incumbents’ pricing).
The willingness of a firm to endure a war of attrition (and remain in the market)
depends both on the losses the firm endures during the war and the profits it receives if
it wins. Suppose that firm i is collocated with one or more rivals. If the last of firm i’s
rivals withdraws after τ periods of conflict, firm i remains in the market and no further
entry occurs, then firm i’s profit will be,
Πi =

1 − δ τ +1
δ τ +1
πi,W +
πi,D ,
1−δ
1−δ

where πi,W < 0 represents the loss firm i incurs in each period of the war of attrition,
and πi,D > 0 represents firm i’s profit in each period of the subsequent duopoly phase.
Rearranging, we see that firm i earns a (weakly) positive profit if,
θi =

πi,D
1
≥ τ +1 − 1.
−πi,W
δ

(2)

In words, θi represents the value to firm i of winning the war of attrition, normalised
by the magnitude of the losses it incurs during the war. Given that the RHS of (2)
is positive and increasing in τ , it follows that firm i’s capacity to profitably endure a
war of attrition is increasing in θi . In the standard treatment of the war of attrition, θi
would be regarded as the firm’s “type”.
Wars of attrition typically possess multiple subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs). As
is summarised by Levin (2004), there are typically two pure strategy equilibria where
one or the other firm exits immediately and also a mixed strategy equilibrium where
each exits the market with some probability. That mixed strategy equilibrium has the
property that exit is delayed but can have some counter-intuitive comparative statics;
for instance, the ‘weak’ firm may have a lower probability of exit than the ‘strong’
firm. For this reason, researchers have focused on alternative equilibrium concepts (for
instance, the introduction of trembles and some incomplete information) to generate
outcomes that are more intuitive (see Myatt, 1999).
8

The derivation of these bounds can be found in section 3.

7

In order to parallel the intuition that has emerged in the war of attrition literature,
we will look for SPEs with the property that high types defeat low types, and identical types have an equal probability of victory. These properties are the analogue of
monotone symmetric strategies in a war of attrition with unknown types (e.g., Bishop,
Canning and Maynard Smith, 1978; Riley, 1980; Kreps and Wilson, 1982).
Definition 1. The strategy of firm i is monotone in a war of attrition if, whenever
firm i is collocated with another firm j, firm i’s participation stage action is:
(a) Remain in the market if θi > θj .
(b) Exit with probability ρ ∈ (0, 1), where ρ leaves firm j indifferent between exiting
and remaining in the market for one more period, if θi = θj .
(c) Exit the market if θi < θj .
If more than one firm is collocated with firm i, then apply the rule with respect to the
collocated firm with the highest type.
It can be readily seen that if the strategy of each firm is monotone in the war of
attrition, except for the special case where firms are symmetric, in equilibrium, there
will be no war of attrition and the ‘stronger’ firm will be present in the market. That
said, we can imagine extensions for future work that enrich the study of the war of
attrition phase to incorporate asymmetric information or other equilibrium types that
have been studied in the literature.
That said, it is useful to emphasise the key differences between the war of attrition,
as it exists in our model, and the standard treatments. First, the war of attrition
is simply one phase in which our dynamic game can find itself. Moreover, the game
does not end when a winner emerges. Rather, the game can enter and exit the war
of attrition phase any number of times as firms enter and exit the market. Second,
in our game, the firm’s “type” in a war of attrition is endogenous. The profits a firm
earns in each phase of the game (πi,D and πi,W ) depend on the actions firms take in
the market stages. In section 4 we show how firms can strategically manipulate these
values, effectively choosing a firm’s type.

3

Competing independent of history

We now turn to analyse the model in detail beginning with a benchmark case where the
actions that firms take in markets are not dependent on history. This is an appropriate
8

starting point because, we will show, it captures the standard intuition as to why
competitive processes lead to inefficient firms being replaced by efficient ones in markets.
In the next section, we examine the equilibria that arise when actions can be history
dependent. However, the equilibrium explored here remains an equilibrium in the
broader context.
The way we do this is focusing, in this section, on situations where firms play
only stationary strategies. Formally, a stationary strategy is a strategy in which firms
condition their actions on the state of the game. That is, the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) in which the actions taken by firms depend on the number, locations
and marginal costs of the firms present in the market, but not on the history of the
game. The stationary SPE serves as the baseline for our analysis. It also functions as
the threat point for the equilibria developed in Section 4.
The first step in characterising the stationary SPE is to establish the actions that
firms take in the market stage of each period.
Lemma 1. In each market stages of a stationary SPE, each firm plays its best response
to the prices chosen by its rivals.
Proof. Actions in the market stage have no effect on the state of the game. It follows
that a firm’s only concern when selecting its price is to maximise its profit in the current
period.
Lemma 1 states that, in a stationary SPE, the prices selected in any period will
constitute a mutual best response. In other words, prices and profits in any given
market stage will be exactly the Nash equilibrium prices and profits of a one-shot
market-stage game.
Given this, we can now state those equilibrium prices. Suppose that firm i is alone
at one end of the line, and that firm j has the lowest price of all firms located at the
opposite end. The indifferent consumer is located a distance,
x∗ =

pj − pi + t
,
2t

from firm i. It follows that the profit firm i receives if it selects the price pi can be
written,

pj − pi + t
− C.
2t
Firm i’s best response function takes the familiar form,
πi (pi , pj ) = (pi − ci )

Ri (pj ) =

p j + t + ci
.

9

Note that Ri is increasing in pj indicating that prices are strategic complements.
If firms 1 and 2 are the only firms present in the market, in a stationary SPE, firms
set the prices p1 = t + c2 /3 and p2 = t + 2c2 /3, and earn the corresponding profits,

and

This outcome remains unchanged if firm 1 is replaced by an efficient entrant. If, instead,
firm 1 competes against an efficient entrant, say firm 3, the firms will set the prices
p1 = p3 = t, and earn profits of π1 = π3 = t/2 − C.
Now consider market-stage actions during a war of attrition in which a third firm,
say firm 3, collocates with an incumbent. Because consumers distinguish between the
collocated firms on the basis of price alone, competition between the firms is pure
Bertrand. This means that if firm 3 collocates with firm 1, both firms will price at
marginal cost p1 = p3 = 0, and make a loss equal to the fixed cost C. If firm 3
collocates with firm 2 we assume that firm 2 prices at marginal cost, and that firm 3
undercuts firm 2 by an arbitrarily small amount. In this case, firm 2 makes a loss of C
and firm 3’s loss is,



where the inequality follows from the assumed lower bound on C.
The interesting case to consider is where both types of entry (by acquisition or de

novo) are viable. This will occur so long as,

In words, the cost of entering the market is strictly less than the discounted sum of
the profits a firm earns as a member of an efficient duopoly. These are the profits an
entrant expects if it displaces the inefficient incumbent.
We can now complete the characterisation of the stationary SPE. We begin by
establishing that an entrant will only ever target the inefficient incumbent.
Lemma 2. In a stationary SPE in which each firm’s strategy is monotone in a war of
attrition (definition 1), an entrant will neither attempt to purchase an efficient incumbent, nor enter de novo and collocate with an efficient incumbent.
Proof. From Lemma 1 it follows that two (or more) collocated efficient firms incur
identical losses during a war of attrition and expect identical duopoly profits in the event
10

of victory. This means that collocated efficient firms have identical types. Definition
1 then requires that each collocated firm exits with a probability that leaves its rival
indifferent between exiting and remaining in the market for one more period. The payoff
to exiting is zero, which means that expected payoff to remaining in the market must
also be zero. Therefore, the expected return to entering and collocating with an efficient
incumbent is −K < 0. Similarly, an entrant will not purchase an efficient incumbent
as the entrant will be no more profitable than the incumbent post acquisition, and the
entrant will incur a transaction cost k > 0.
We can now demonstrate that an SPE exists where the inefficient incumbent is
always immediately replaced by an efficient entrant using the least cost path.
Proposition 1. In a stationary SPE in which each firm’s strategy is monotone in a
war of attrition (definition 1),
(a) If k ≤ K then firm 3 acquires firm 2 for a fee F ∈ [0, K − k].
(b) If K < k then firm 3 enters de novo, collocating with firm 2, and firm 2 exits
immediately.
In either case, no further entry occurs.
Proof. For (b), K < k implies that it is cheaper for a firm to construct a new presence
in the market, than to restructure an incumbent firm. If firm 3 enters de novo and
collocates with firm 2 then,

Because firm 2 has a lower type, it exits the market immediately. It follows that de
novo entry is profitable for firm 3. Note that firm 2 cannot do better by remaining in
the market as it incurs a loss of C in each period of a war of attrition. Similarly, firm
3 has no incentive to exit as firm 2 exits with certainty.
For (a) note that the possibility of de novo entry remains as an outside option for
firm 3. De novo entry costs firm 3 an amount K and reduces firm 2’s profit to zero. It
follows that firm 3 will acquire firm 2 for a fee F ∈ [0, K − k] that lies between these
outside options. This interval exists if k ≤ K.

11

The SPE described in Proposition 1 conforms to the conventional wisdom on the
role that entry and competition play in eliminating inefficient firms. When a firm lags
behind its competitors, it becomes an attractive target for acquisition by an entrant that
can utilise the firm’s position in the market more profitably than the current owners.
In the absence of a sale, an inefficient incumbent is vulnerable to competition from an
efficient de novo entrant that can price the incumbent firm out of the market.

4

Strategic intervention by the efficient incumbent

We are now in a position to introduce the primary conceptual innovation in this paper:
That for there to be persistent differences in firm performance, some set of agents must
provide inefficient firms with permission to exist. The previous section confirmed that,
in the standard intuition, consumers would not provide that permission to an inefficient
incumbent. Here, we examine whether the efficient incumbent has the ability and the
incentive to provide that permission thereby exposing a new mechanism where firm
differences may persist. Operationally, what the efficient incumbent is trying to do is
to modify the inefficient incumbent’s type so that it will prevail in a war of attrition
with an efficient entrant.
In the analysis of the previous section, the efficient incumbent was a passive player.
Firm 1 did nothing to influence the price of firm 2 in the acquisition market, nor the
type of firm 2 in a war of attrition. Yet firm 1 has a strong incentive to intervene. If an
2
efficient entrant replaces firm 2, firm 1’s profit falls from 2t1 t + c32 − C to t/2 − C.
In this section, we show how the efficient incumbent can prevent entry or acquisition
by unilaterally reducing competition in the market and, in the process, directing a
stream of profits to its inefficient rival. This action has two effects. First, the increased
profits enjoyed by firm 2 increases the value of the firm to its owners. This, in turn,
raises the price of firm 2 in the acquisition market.9 At the same time, the stream of
profits increases the prize firm 2 receives on winning a war of attrition, and hence, it
increases firm 2’s type in any such war.

4.1

The relational contracting equilibrium

To begin with, we characterise a relational contracting equilibrium. The relational
contracting equilibrium is an SPE of the game in which the unilateral conduct of firm 1,
9

12

reducing the intensity of competition during the duopoly phase, is sufficient to prevent
entry. The term ‘relational contracting’ comes from the notion that firm 1 uses the
value of its ongoing relationship or interaction with firm 2 to make credible a promise
to act in a favourable manner in the market stage of the game.
Definition 2. A relational contracting equilibrium is an SPE of the game in which:
(a) All firms employ strategies that are monotone in a war of attrition.
(b) In a duopoly phase in which firms 1 and 2 are active in the market, firm 1 sets
the price,

for some arbitrarily small ε > 0, and firm 2 plays its best response to pR

(d) If firm 1 sets a price of less than pR
1 during a duopoly phase, or if firm 2 exits the market, the game immediately and permanently reverts to the stationary
equilibrium outlined in Proposition 1.
Definition 2 has a straightforward interpretation. First, in order to be consistent
with the stationary equilibrium developed in Proposition 1, condition (a) requires all
firms to employ strategies that are monotone in a war of attrition. This consistency
is important as the stationary equilibrium also functions as the threat point in the
relational contracting equilibrium.
The distinguishing feature of the relational contracting equilibrium is the equilibrium path duopoly-phase behaviour, characterised in condition (b). Firm 1 unilaterally
raises its price above its best response. Firm 1’s price pR
1 is selected to maximise its
equilibrium path profit subject to the requirement that both types of entry are rendered
not viable. The derivations of the values in (3) can be found in the proof of Proposition
2 below.
Note that under condition (b), firm 2 always plays its best response to firm 1’s price.
One useful feature of this as a condition of the SPE is that neither firm is colluding and

13

so there are no antitrust implications from firm 1’s strategic behaviour.10
Should entry occur, condition (c) states that firms will set prices as they would in the
stationary equilibrium. Setting higher prices would be counterproductive as it would
reduce the losses incurred by the entrant. We consider the possibility of an incumbent
adopting more aggressive pricing below.
Finally, condition (d) states that any deviation by firms 1 or 2 results in immediate
reversion to the stationary equilibrium. This means that any failure by firm 1 to
deliver the requierd profits to firm 2 results in firm 2 exiting the market in the following
period. Moreover, condition (d) ensures that an entrant will not profit from firm 1’s
accommodating behaviour towards firm 2, and hence that the entrant’s type in a war
of attrition is not affected.

Profits during a war of attrition, and firm 3’s profit if it succeeds in replacing firm 2,
are as in the stationary SPE described in Proposition 1. It follows that firm 2 will have

While it is true that the equilibrium involves both firms charging prices in excess of “competitive”
levels, this is the result of unilateral conduct by firm 1. Firm 2’s response is always to maximise its
profits in the current period. Moreover, because the unilateral conduct is not to the detriment of a
competitor, it is unlikely to raise regulatory flags.

14

which is satisfied by Definition 2.
Step 2: An entrant will be unable to acquire firm 2. With the threat of de novo entry
not credible, firm 3 can only acquire firm 2 if firm 3’s post-entry profit, net of the
transaction cost, is greater than firm 2’s profit. Note that by definition 2,
pR
1 ≥

3t + c2

Thus, in each period of a duopoly phase, firm 2 earns,

which is firm 3’s post-entry profits, net of the amortised transaction cost.
Step 3: For sufficiently high δ ∈ (0, 1), firm 1 will not deviate if pR
1 satisfies (4). Firm
1 earns a profit of,
3t − pR

1 > R1 (R2 (p1 )), firm 1 can increase its

profit in the current period by lowering its price. The cost of deviating is reversion to the
stationary equilibrium in the following period. Given that firm 2 will be immediately
replaced by an efficient entrant in the stationary equilibrium, firm 1’s profits in all
future periods will be t/2 − C. It follows that if firms are sufficiently patient, firm 1
will not deviate so long as,

Solving for pR

Proposition 2 establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for a relational
contracting equilibrium to exist for some discount factor. It confirms that strategic
behaviour by firm 1 can alter the long-term competitive outcome in the industry by
deterring the entry of efficient firms. The precise level of the critical discount factor

15

will depend on the magnitude of firm 1’s equilibrium path profits, relative to its profits
in the stationary equilibrium.
Before turning to consider the comparative statics and empirical implications of
Proposition 2, it is useful to note that the equilibrium can exist even in situations
where firm 1 would, in the stationary equilibrium with entry barriers, have a sufficient
efficiency advantage to drive firm 2 out of the market. Specifically, if C is relatively
large, lying in the non-empty interval,
 

then firm 2 makes a loss in each period of a stationary equilibrium. If subsequent
entry is not possible, then firm 1 is happy to see firm 2 exit the market as this leaves
it with a monopoly, albeit with a single location. If, entry is possible then firm 1
cannot preserve this monopoly and is, therefore, better off protecting firm 2.11 This
demonstrates that even when condition (a) in the introduction does not hold (that is,
expansion by existing firms can drive inefficient firms out of the market), the relational
contracting equilibrium can exist with firms with different levels of efficiency persisting.

4.2

Firm performance

We now turn to consider the comparative statics of the relational contracting equilibrium in order to better understand the empirical implications of our theory. In a
relational contracting equilibrium, prices along the equilibrium path, and the resultant
profits, depend both on firm 2’s relative inefficiency (c2 ) and the fixed cost of operating
in the market (C).12 From definition 2 it follows that firm 1’s duopoly phase price pR
1
is the piecewise maximum of two functions,
pmax =

If C lies below this level then firm 2 is profitable in the stationary equilbrium and cannot be
displaced unless firm 1 reverts to predatory pricing as explained in Section 5 below.
12
The travel cost t also appears in the definition of pR
1 , however t is only significant in its magnitude
relative to c2 and C. Within the model, the effects of an increase in t are equivalent to proportional
decreases in c2 and C.

Here, pmax is the price that maximises firm 1’s equilibrium path profits subject to the
assumption that firm 2 will play its best response.13 While, the second price, pwar , is the
lowest price that delivers firm 2 the necessary profits to win a war of attrition against
an efficient entrant.
The relationship between pmax and c2 is illustrated in Figure 2. Firm 1’s profit
maximising price is linear and strictly increasing in c2 . Moreover, pmax is independent
of the common fixed cost.
Figure 2 also shows the relationship between pwar and c2 , for three different levels
of the fixed cost. These curves are convex and strictly increasing in c2 , while pwar is
strictly decreasing in the fixed cost C.
13

Essentially, pmax is the price firm 1 would choose as a Stackelberg leader. Meza and Tomback
(2009) explore the notion that in an entry game leadership may be endogenous, although their setting
is essentially static.

17

Notice that pmax > pwar in the neighbourhood of c2 = 0, and as such pR
1 = pmax
where firm 2’s marginal cost is relatively low. As c2 increases, a point is reached at
which pwar crosses pmax , and thereafter pR
1 = pwar . This crossing must occur as pwar
tends to infinity as c2 approaches the level that would cause C to violate the lower
bound established in (1). Intuitively, as C approaches its lower bound, an entrant
almost breaks even during a war of attrition. This means that the entrant is willing to
wait a very long time to achieve victory. To counter this advantage, firm 2 must receive
arbitrarily high profits when it wins. But this requires firm 1 to set an arbitrarily high
price in the duopoly phase. The value of c2 at which the crossing occurs is, itself, an
increasing function of C, as pwar is a decreasing function of C.
Of course, the relational contracting equilibrium also requires that firm 1’s price
satisfies the finite upper bound in (4). The upper bound is illustrated in figure 2
as the finite and strictly increasing function p̄R
1 . As shown in figure 2, for every C
there exists an upper bound c̄2 (C) ∈ (0, t), on the relative inefficiency of firm 2 that
can be accommodated in a relational contracting equilibrium. If firm 2’s marginal
cost exceeds this threshold, a relational contracting equilibrium does not exist for any
discount factor. The upper bound is an increasing function of C indicating that the
robustness of a relational contracting equilibrium improves as the fixed cost of operating
in the market increases.
Proposition 3. In the duopoly phase of a relational contracting equilibrium,
(a) For all c2 and C, firm 1’s duopoly phase price pR
1 is strictly greater than firm 2’s
duopoly phase price R2 (pR
1 ), and therefore, firm 1’s market share is strictly less
than that of firm 2.
R
(b) If pR
1 = pmax (resp. p1 = pwar ), firm 1’s market share increases (resp. decreases)

in c2 .
(c) If pR
1 = pmax , firm 1’s profit increases in c2 , while firm 2’s profit decreases.
(d) If pR
1 = pwar , firm 2’s profit increases in c2 , while firm 1’s profit is a concave
function of c2 , initially increasing before decreasing to π1 = t/2 − C at c2 = c̄2 (C).

Proof. For (a) it is sufficient to show that pr1 > R(pR
1 ). The two cases are,
R2 (pmax ) =

In this region, π1 (resp. π2 ) is unambiguously increasing (resp. decreasing) in c2 . For

The first term on the RHS is unambiguously positive. The second term on the RHS is
zero where pmax = pwar , and negative thereafter, tending to −∞ as c2 approaches the
level that would cause C to violate its lower bound.
Proposition 3 develops the surprising result that, within the duopoly phase of a
relational contracting equilibrium, the inefficient firm has a greater market share than
its efficient rival. Firm 1’s market share is highest where pmax = pwar . At low levels of
c2 firm 1 loses market share because firm 2 is relatively aggressive. In the region where
pR
1 = pwar , firm 1 must sacrifice significant market share to firm 2 as c2 increases, in
order to keep firm 2 competitive in a war of attrition.
The relationship between c2 and firm profits is illustrated in Figure 3 for the case
in which C = 0.4t. As stated in Proposition 3, firm 1’s profits are initially increasing
√

√ 2 t ≈ 0.31t. This
while firm 2’s are declining. Firm 1’s profits pass firm 2’s at c2 = 5−3
1+ 2
crossing point does not depend on C as pmax is independent of C. Firm 2’s profit does

not exceed that of firm 1 again until after the point at which pmax = pwar . In this
example the second crossing occurs where c2 ≈ 0.44t.14
14

Note that if C is small, pwar crosses pmax before the profit functions cross. In this case π1 < π2
for all c2 .

the value of c2 at which pmax = pwar , the range over which π1 > π2 and the value of c2
that maximises π2 , for the values of C illustrated in Figure 2.

4.3

Consumer welfare

The welfare of any given consumer depends both on the distance they have to travel to
purchase the good and on the price of the good. A consumer who travels a distance x,
and pays a price p, receives a surplus of,
u = v − p − xt.
Figure 4 illustrates consumer welfare under a relational contracting equilibrium, and
contrasts it with the surplus consumers receive under the various baselines of the model.
The horizontal axis in Figure 4 represents a consumer’s location on the unit line.
The four lines show the surplus consumers receive under various scenarios. From top to
bottom these are: The competitive equilibrium with two efficient firms; the competitive
equilibrium with one efficient and one inefficient firm; the relational contracting equi15
librium with pR
and the price a monopoly would charge if it had a presence
1 = pmax ;

at each end of the market.
Each line initially slopes down because a consumer’s surplus decreases at a rate of
t per unit of distance traveled. In any given equilibrium, the consumer with the lowest
surplus is the consumer who is indifferent between the offerings of the two firms. The
location of this consumer also defines the market shares of the competing firms.
Figure 4 shows that, from the perspective of consumers, the best case is when two
efficient firms compete. This equilibrum both has the lowest prices and minimises travel
costs. The next best equilibrium is competition between one efficient and one inefficient
15

Where pR
1 = pwar this line would be even lower.

of centre choose to purchase from the more distant, but cheaper, firm. As shown in
Proposition 3(a), the relational contracting equilibrium reverses this relationship. The
inefficient firm now has the lowest price and captures the largest market share. The
only case that is worse for consumers than the relational contracting equilibrium is
where a monopoly controls both locations and sets a price of v − t/2.

4.4

Empirical implications

As described in the introduction, we view our model here as complementary to existing
theories of PPDs that are based on frictions to competitive processes in markets. That
said, there are some implications of the model that may be amenable to direct empirical
testing should the right opportunity present itself.
First, the relational contracting equilibrium does not exist if there are barriers to
entry. To see this, suppose that there were no entrants available with a higher efficiency
level than the inefficient incumbent. In this case, the efficient incumbent would have no
incentive to offer softer prices in the market as this would reduce their ongoing profits
without the benefit of forestalling entry by more efficient firms. Thus, if we imagined
a shock that suddenly reduced or eliminated entry barriers (e.g., deregulation of an
industry or trade liberalisation), then our model predicts that a distribution of firm
performance could emerge thereafter. Examining such an event could generate a test
of the model’s prediction.16
Second, the mechanism we identify here suggests that dispersion in firm performance
is associated with stability in the identity of firms in the market. Specifically, dispersion
in firm performance is associated with less churn amongst the firms – including the less
efficient. While some analyses17 have found that some of the worst performing firms
exit the market (something consistent with our model), it would be instructive to look
at the relationship between dispersion amongst the long-lived firms in the industry
and how this relates to exogenous events that may change those firm’s identities (e.g.,
16

Relatedly, suppose that, initially, all firms have marginal cost c2 > 0. One day, firm 1 develops and
patents a production technology that yields c1 = 0. During the life of the patent the market behaves
according to the stationary equilibrium in Proposition 1. Once the patent expires, firm 1 implements
a relational contracting equilibrium with firm 2 to protect its advantage. What changes? All prices go
up and the order of prices is reversed (p1 < p2 in the stationary equilibrium is replaced by p1 > p2 ).
This results in firm 1 yielding market share to firm 2. Unless firm 2 is very inefficient, both firms’
profits increase. (If c2 is close to c̄2 (C) then firm 1’s profits may fall.)
17
Syverson (2004).

23

acquisition, mergers, technological shocks, etc).

4.5

Endogenous efficiency

Thus far, we have shown that when two firms in a natural duopoly start from differing
levels of efficiency, there can exist an equilibrium whereby that distribution of efficiency
is preserved even in the face of entry. Here, we analyse the outcomes when firms can
choose their efficiency level, say, for some upfront cost.
First, suppose that, for a cost of F , a firm can reduce its marginal cost from c2
to 0. Then if firm 1 has a cost of 0 while firm 2 has a cost of c2 , if firm 2 expends
F (regardless of how small F is), then its profits would be strictly lower compared
with what it earns in the relational contracting equilibrium. This is intuitive as the
same outcome could occur if an entrant acquired firm 2 and, in a relational contracting
equilibrium, an entrant has no incentive to do that (even when transaction costs, k, are
0).
Second, suppose that both incumbents in an industry are inefficient and have
marginal costs of c2 . Suppose also that prior to entry, each can simultaneously choose
whether to expend F and reduce their marginal costs to 0. If neither do so, then at
least one of them would be replaced by the first efficient entrant. Following that, if a
relational contracting equilibrium emerges (which is now possible given that there are
asymmetries in efficiency), then firm differences will persist thereafter with the efficient
firm earning π1 and the inefficient firm earning π2 . Thus, at the outset, each incumbent’s expected payoff is around π2 /2 as it is random where entry might occur and
the acquisition price would reflect the entrant’s option to enter. By contrast, if both
incumbents reduce their marginal costs, then each has an expected profit that would
be earned under competition between efficient firms less F . Finally, if one firm invests
while the other does not, then the investing firm earns π1 − F and the other firm earns
π2 . From this, it can be seen that, so long as π1 − F > π2 /2, then there exists two pure
strategy equilibria involving one or the other firm choosing to become efficient with the
other remaining inefficient. Thus, from symmetrical starting conditions, a distribution
of efficiencies emerges.
Finally, it is worth remarking that if entrants had differing levels of efficiency, then
we can imagine models whereby an efficient incumbent allows entry to occur until the
point where the entrant whose efficiency level generates the most profits for the efficient

24

incumbent in an relational contracting equilibrium appears.18 This might assist in
pinning down the precise expected distribution of firm efficiencies.

5

Extensions

We now consider some extensions to our baseline model. We consider the implications
of additional firms being part of the natural oligopoly before demonstrating that there
are equilibria that expand the range of parameters under which PPDs arise. Finally,
we comment on whether the equilibrium is robust to other forms of within market
competition such as quantity competition.

5.1

Three firms

A natural extension of our model is the case in which firm 1 must protect multiple
rivals of varying efficiencies. Consider the case of three firms, firms 1, 2 and 3, evenly
spaced around the unit circle. Suppose that the marginal costs of the firms satisfy
0 = c1 < c2 ≤ c3 < t/3. As before, all potential entrants are assumed to be efficient
with marginal costs of zero.
The reduced lower bound on c3 is required by the higher intensity of competition on
the unit circle.It is also necessary
to place tighter bounds on the common fixed cost


such that C ∈ c3 c2 −2c3t3 +5t/3 , 9t . The interpretation of these bounds is the same as for
those in (1) above.
Along the short arc of the circle between firms i and j, the indifferent consumer is
located at a distance of,
1 pj − pi
,
x∗ij = +

from firm i. It follows that firm i’s profit can be written,

While firm i’s best response function is,

As a baseline, it is useful to note that for a market in which three efficient firms compete,
equilibrium prices and profits are t/3 and t/9, respectively.

These marginal costs are detailed in table 1 for a range of values of C.

Solving for pT1 yields the required constraints.
The price firm 1 sets in the three-firm case displays essentially the same relationship
with the marginal cost of the most inefficient firm, and the common fixed cost, as was
26

the case in the two-firm relational contracting equilibrium discussed above. Of interest
here is the role that firm 2’s marginal cost plays in the equilibrium.
From the perspective of firm 1, the best case is where the two remaining incumbents
share the same inefficiency. A high c2 increases firm 1’s price and profit when the first
term on the RHS of (7) binds. It also increases the price ceiling in (8). At the same
time, the second constraint on the RHS of (7) is decreasing in c2 . This means that
as c2 rises relative to c3 , the first term on the RHS of (7) binds for a wider range of
parameter values.
The intuition behind this outcome is straightforward. Firm 2 plays no role in protecting firm 3 from entry or acquisition. As firm 2 becomes more efficient, it both
reduces firm 1’s profits through more intense direct competition and reduces the effectiveness of firm 1’s efforts to protect firm 3 by competing away a portion of firm 3’s
profits. This demonstrates that it is possible to enrich the model by adding more firms
into the market. This, however, raises issues as to the appropriate product space which
is a direction we leave open to future research.

5.2

Firm 1’s efficiency

While we have considered the role that firm 2’s marginal cost plays in determining
the stability of a relational contracting equilibrium, throughout the paper it was always
assumed that firm 1 operates at the technological frontier. The consequences of relaxing
this assumption depend on where firm 1’s marginal cost sits relative to the marginal
costs of the potential entrants.
Similar to Byford and Gans (2014), allowing for firm 1 to be more efficient than the
potential entrants only strengthens a relational contracting equilibrium. Intuitively, as
an entrant’s efficiency falls relative to that of the efficient incumbent, so too does its
type in a war of attrition. It follows that pmax will bind over a larger range of c2 (weakly)
increasing firm 1’s duopoly-phase profits. This demonstrates that our potential driver
of PPDs is a complement to existing theories that provide reasons why an incumbent
may have other efficiency advantages over potential entrants. If those theories hold, the
prediction that there will be a dispersion in performance is strengthened. Moreover, the
relational contracting equilibrium could be sustained without the additional implication
that the efficient firm’s market share is less than the inefficient firm’s share.
On the other hand, if firm 1 is less efficient than the potential entrants (0 < c1 < c2 ),
there are two possible outcomes. If the costs of entry and acquisition (K and k) are

27

sufficiently high, or equivalently if c1 is sufficiently close to zero, firm 1 will remain in
the market. However, by the reverse of the logic outlined above, a relational contracting
equilibrium will be weaker and possibly cease to exist. If entry or acquisition is viable,
then an efficient entrant maximises its profits by displacing firm 1, and then protecting
firm 2 as the new efficient incumbent, in the manner described in Section 4.

5.3

A relational contract with predation

The relational contracting equilibrium shows how an efficient incumbent can unilaterally improve an inefficient rival’s type, thereby eliminating the threat of de novo entry.
As noted above, for some parameter values there does not exist a price pR
1 that simultaneously satisfies (3) and (4) (or equivalently c2 ≥ c̄2 (C)). Where this is the case, any
price high enough to give firm 2 the edge in a war of attrition reduces firm 1’s profits
below the level it would receive if firm 2 were replaced by an efficient entrant.
The advantage the entrant enjoys when firm 2 has a high marginal cost can be
reduced if the inefficient incumbent employs predatory pricing during a war of attrition.
By pricing at the entrant’s marginal cost, firm 2 guarantees that the entrant will incur
a loss of C in each period of a war of attrition. Of course, this requires firm 2 to make
sales at a price below its own marginal cost, increasing the loss firm 2 incurs during the
war.
Definition 4. A predatory equilibrium is an SPE of the game, satisfying definition 2,
with conditions (b) and (c) replaced by,

for some arbitrarily small ε > 0, and firm 2 plays its best response to pP1 .
(c0 ) During a war of attrition firm 2 sets the price p2 = 0, firm 1 plays its best response
to this price, and firm 3 does not offer units for sale. If firm 2 charges a price in
excess of p2 = 0, thereafter each firm plays its best response to the prices chosen
by its rivals.
The interpretation of condition (b0 ) is the same as that of condition (b) in definition
2. The change to firm 1’s duopoly-phase price is due to the higher losses both firms
28

incur during a war of attrition. The second value in (9) is derived in the proof of
Proposition 5 below.
Condition (c0 ) captures the key difference between the relational contracting equilibrium and the predatory equilibrium. In a predatory equilibrium, firm 2 sets the price
p2 = 0 < c2 during a war of attrition. Firm 1 still plays its best response, and the
entrant does not offer its goods for sale. (Refusing to trade maximises the cost to firm
2 of its predatory pricing.)
Note that during a war of attrition, firm 2 has an incentive to raise its price above
zero. At a higher price, firm 2’s losses are lower. Condition (c0 ) states that if firm 2
fails to implement below cost pricing, behaviour during the war of attrition reverts to
that described by condition (c) of definition 2. This change in behaviour alters the
types of the collocated firms because subsequent losses in the war of attrition are lower.
Intuitively, in this equilibrium, the failure of firm 2 to follow through on the threat of
predatory pricing undermines firm 2’s credibility, and as such all firms return to playing
their best responses.
Proposition 5. For sufficiently high δ ∈ (0, 1), if c2 ≥ c̄2 (C) then a predatory equilibrium exists.
Proof. Steps 2 and 3 from the proof to Proposition 2 ensure that firm 1 will not deviate
during the duopoly phase, and that entry by acquisition is not viable so long as (4)
holds.
To see that firm 2’s type is higher than an entrant’s, note that the entrant makes a
loss of C during a war of attrition as it makes no sales, while firm 2’s loss is C + 34 c2 .

a war of attrition as a deviation results in the inefficient incumbent losing the war, while
maintaining p2 = 0 results in victory and a positive payoff.
To see that pP1 satisfies (4), first note that pP1 is continuous and decreasing in C.
It follows that the worst case is where C approaches the lower bound defined in (1).

which is the upper bound on pP1 from (4).
Proposition 5 proves that the damage done to an entrant’s type as a result of
predatory pricing by firm 2 during a war of attrition, is sufficient to guarantee firm 2
victory in the war. It is unclear how regulators would regard firm 2’s behaviour. While
it is true that firm 2’s unilateral conduct following entry involves it pricing below its
own marginal cost, it does not price below the entrant’s marginal cost. Indeed, if the
entrant matches firm 2’s price, its profit on the marginal unit is zero. The losses of the
collocated firms could still be attributed to the natural duopoly characteristic of the
market.

5.4

Other competitive environments

Our model is set on the Hotelling line as this model of competition illustrates how a
strong firm can protect a weak rival from entry or acquisition. It remains an open
question as to what other competitive environments can support equilibria in the vein
of definitions 2 and 4. While we do not provide a definitive answer in this paper, we
can identify two characteristics that are likely to be necessary.
First, our model depends on the natural oligopoly structure of the market. The
mechanism requires that when an efficient entrant enters de novo, attempting to displace
the inefficient incumbent, the result is a war of attrition. If an entrant could compete
against the inefficient incumbent without incurring a loss, as would be the case in our
model if C were below the lower bound in (1), there would be no incentive for the
entrant to exit the market, regardless of firm 1’s duopoly-phase behaviour.
Second, it is important that market-stage actions are strategic complements. Intuitively, when firm 1 raises its price to direct a stream of profits to firm 2, firm 2 responds
by likewise increasing its price. This reduces the cost to firm 1 of engaging in accommodating behaviour. In contrast, where the actions of firms are strategic substitutes
30

(as they are in Cournot quantity competition), firm 2 responds to firm 1’s largesse with
increased aggression. This increases the cost to firm 1 of accommodating firm 2 and
may preclude a relational contracting equilibrium for any parameter values.19

Conclusion and future directions

This paper has presented a new approach to examining how persistent performance
differences amongst firms might arise in the face of strong competitive pressures (in
particular, entry). It has done so by considering which actors have both the ability
and the incentive to give an inefficient firm permission to exist. We identified the inefficient firm’s efficient incumbent rivals as a natural candidate. We then proceeded to
demonstrate, using a special but commonly examined environment, that an efficient incumbent could unilaterally present conditions that permitted its inefficient counterpart
to either act strongly in the face of entry or hold a position that was too expensive for
an efficient entrant to acquire.
While our approach here was to provide a ‘proof of concept’ rather than a general
treatment, the foundation of the model is on familiar elements. Future research could
easily examine alternative modes of oligopolistic competition with richer specifications
and elements, wars of attrition that involved information asymmetries and uncertainty
and finally alternative mechanisms to transfer rents from efficient to inefficient incumbents such as openness and disclosure as well as the licensing of key technologies. Thus,
we believe that our model presented in this paper offers many directions that could lead
to formal models tailored to specific strategic circumstances in particular industries. At
the same time, this offers the possibility for more nuanced predictions to further empirical examination of PPDs.
