    "abstract": "\n\nUsing loan-level data on millions of used-car transactions across hundreds of lenders, we study the consumer response to exogenous variation in credit terms. Borrowers o\ufb00ered shorter maturity decrease expenditures enough to o\ufb00set 60-90% of the monthly payment increase. Most of this is driven by shifting toward lower quality cars, but a\ufb00ected borrowers are able to o\ufb00set 20-30% of a monthly payment shock by negotiating lower prices for equivalent cars. Our results suggest that durable goods prices adjust to re\ufb02ect credit terms even at the individual level, with one year of additional loan maturity increasing a given car\u2019s price by 2.8%.\n\n",
