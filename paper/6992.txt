Introduction
The modern literature on the choice of fixed versus flexible exchange rate regimes traces back
to Friedman (1953). Friedman’s contribution emphasized the enhanced flexibility of relative prices
afforded by floating exchange rates in a world where nominal goods prices adjust slowly. A
country can be insulated to some degree from foreign demand shocks under floating exchange rates
because relative price movements absorb some of the changes in demand that would have to be met
by changes in quantities produced under fixed exchange rates.
Friedman’s early work was supplemented and refined in the 1960s by Mundell (1960, 1961a,
1961b, 1963) who explored the role of capital mobility in the choice of exchange-rate regimes.
Whether fixed or floating exchange rates are better depends in Mundell’s work on whether the
source of shocks was monetary or real; on the degree of capital and other factor mobility; and, on
the relative size of countries.
A large literature in the 1970s and 1980s, in turn, extended Mundell by incorporating a role for
expectations. Contributors include Turnovsky (1976, 1983), Fischer (1976), Hamada and Sakurai
(1978), Flood (1979), Flood and Marion (1983), Weber (1981), Kimbrough (1983), Aizenman and
Frenkel (1985), and Glick and Wihlborg (1990). These papers evaluated the optimality of
exchange-rate regimes on ad hoc criteria, generally involving variance of output and inflation.
We investigate the optimality of exchange rate regimes from a welfare maximization standpoint.
Others have studied the welfare properties of alternative exchange-rate systems, including Lapan
and Enders (1980), Helpman (1981), Helpman and Razin (1982), Eaton (1985), Aizenman (1994),
Chinn and Miller (1998), and Neumeyer (1998). These papers, however, do not assume any sort of
nominal price stickiness, and therefore do not follow directly in the tradition of Friedman and
Mundell.

The model we use is a two-country, infinite-horizon model of optimization under uncertainty.
Consumers get utility from consumption, leisure and real balances. We assume that there is perfect
capital mobility, because we allow a complete market of state-contingent nominal bonds. The
sources of uncertainty are random monetary shocks at home and abroad. We assume that
monopolistic firms must set nominal prices prior to the realization of monetary shocks. Prices
adjust fully after one period.
Two important features of the economy that we examine are motivated in part by the empirical
research of Robert Lipsey. First is the nature of how price setting affects the optimal choice of
exchange-rate regime. Friedman and Mundell assumed that producers set prices in their own
currency, and that those prices do not adjust when exchange rates change. Indeed, in their models,
the law of one price holds for all goods.
Lipsey has demonstrated how poor the law of one price assumption is. The seminal paper in
this regard is Kravis and Lipsey (1978).1 That paper demonstrates that prices show substantial
deviations from purchasing power parity. Moreover, relative prices move with exchange rates:
countries with weaker currencies have lower prices. These movements appear to be attributable to a
large extent to failures of the law of one price: “There are reasons for believing that there may be
substantial deviations from the law of one price even for traded goods (p.227).” Furthermore, it
appears from microeconomic data that firms set different prices for consumers in different
countries. They conclude, “A given seller may charge different prices for a given product to
different destinations (p. 234),” and, “Price discrimination … is quite common in international trade
(p. 234).”

See also Kravis and Lipsey (1987).

More recent empirical research confirms those findings.2 Swedenborg and Lipsey (1998)
conclude that even for highly tradable food items, a significant temporary factor affecting relative
prices across countries is exchange rate movements. We conclude that a better description of price
setting is that nominal prices are sticky in the currency of the consumer. We refer to this type of
price stickiness as “pricing to market”.
We have argued that the type of price stickiness may be of critical importance in the analysis of
fixed versus floating exchange rates (Devereux and Engel (1998)). We find that under floating
exchange rates and pricing to market, foreign monetary shocks do not affect domestic
consumption.3 In contrast, when prices are set in the producers’ currencies, the prices paid by home
residents for foreign goods changes as the exchange rate changes. This introduces a channel
through which the foreign monetary shocks can affect domestic consumption. The larger the share
of foreign goods in consumption, the more vulnerable will consumption be to foreign money
shocks. The type of pricing behavior also influences the average level of prices, consumption and
leisure under floating exchange rates.
We extend our earlier paper by examining the role of the price-setting behavior of firms when
there is internationalized production. Lipsey’s empirical work has documented the large and
increasing role for multinationals in U.S. and world production. Lipsey (1998) finds that
internationalized production grew from four and a half percent of world output in 1970 to seven
percent of world output in 1995. In manufacturing, the share rose from twelve percent in 1970 to
sixteen percent in 1990 (and probably much higher by 1995.) Blomstrom, Fors and Lipsey (1997)
find that U.S. firms allocated more labor-intensive operations to foreign affiliates. Kravis and

See especially Engel (1993, 1998), Rogers and Jenkins (1996), and Engel and Rogers (1996).
However, we shall see that foreign monetary variance may influence the expected level of home consumption.

3

Lipsey (1982, 1992), and Lipsey (1988, 1993) document the increasing role for multinational
production for U.S. firms.
For purposes of comparison with standard models that assume no internationalized production,
we make the extreme assumption that all production for export occurs in foreign affiliates. Kravis
and Lipsey (1992) document that by the late 1980s, U.S. multinationals export more from their
foreign affiliates abroad than from the U.S.
The model in this paper of floating exchange rates with prices set in producers’ currency is
based on Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998). That model, in turn, is influenced by the non-stochastic
models of Corsetti and Pesenti (1998) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995). These models are examples
of recent international models with optimizing agents and prices which are sticky in producers’
currencies which include Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1989), Kollman (1996) and Hau (1998).
Our pricing to market model shares some of the characteristics of Bacchetta and van Wincoop’s
(1998) examination of how exchange rate regime affects the volume of trade and capital flows in a
stochastic two-period model of pricing to market. Our model of pricing to market is also related to
the work of Betts and Devereux (1996, 1998a, 1998b). Other recent general equilibrium models in
which prices are sticky in consumers’ currencies include Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (1997), Tille
(1998a, 1998b) and Engel (1996).
None of the aforementioned models, however, allow for any internationalized production.
The general models are laid out in section 1. In section 2, we investigate the welfare
comparisons of fixed versus floating exchange rates under the two models of price-setting behavior.
Section 3 compares the results with those of Devereux and Engel (1998), so that we can ascertain
the role of internationalized production. The concluding section points to some potential
weaknesses of our analysis and directions for future research.

1. The Model
Here we lay out the main features of the models we examine. The model for consumers follows
exactly that of Devereux and Engel (1998), which in turn closely follows the model of consumption
in Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998). Consumers maximize expected lifetime utility, taking prices and
wages as given. Home-country agents own home-country firms (and similarly for foreign country
agents). Firm managers make production and pricing decisions. Each consumer receives a share of
profits from every firm in which he owns shares. Monetary authorities in each country let the
money supply fluctuate randomly in the floating exchange rate models, and this is the only source
of uncertainty in the model. In the fixed exchange rate model, the foreign monetary authority
determines the foreign money supply (randomly), while the domestic central bank controls the
domestic money supply in order to keep the exchange rate fixed.
There are sticky goods prices in our models. Producers must set prices prior to the realization of
monetary shocks. One could justify this constraint with an appropriate menu-cost model, though we
do not model this and simply view the stickiness of prices as an institutional constraint. Prices
adjust fully to monetary shocks after one period. There is no persistence to the price-adjustment
process. We consider two separate types of price setting. In the first type, producers must set prices
in their own currency. For example, the home currency price of home goods is preset, and
unresponsive to monetary shocks. This implies that the price for home goods paid by foreign
consumers varies when the exchange rate changes in response to monetary shocks. In the other type
of model, producers preset prices in consumers’ currencies. Home firms set one price for homecountry consumers in the home currency and another price for foreign-country consumers in the
foreign currency. In the fixed exchange rate model, the currency in which prices are set is irrelevant

5

since the exchange rate is assumed to be fixed permanently. In each of the models, the objective of
the firm managers is to maximize the expected utility of the representative owner of the firm.
We shall contrast the exchange-rate regime choice when all production by home firms is
accomplished with domestic factors of production (as in Devereux and Engel (1998)), with a
production configuration in which the domestically-owned firm produces goods for sale to
foreigners using foreign factors of production. (Similarly, goods sold by the foreign-owned firm to
home residents are produced by home-country factors.)

Consumers
The representative consumer in the home country maximizes:

C is a consumption index over home and foreign consumption:

There are n identical individuals in the home country, 0 < n < 1 , and 1-n in the foreign country. Ch

country, respectively:

The elasticity of substitution between any two goods produced within a country is λ , which we
assume to be greater than 1. There is a unit elasticity of substitution between the home goods and
foreign goods bundles. M

P

represents domestic real balances, and L is the labor supply of the

representative home agent.
The utility function we consider here is one case investigated by Devereux and Engel (1998).
They examine a more general welfare function in which real balances enter as a power function, and
labor enters quadratically. We choose this simpler representation for utility here for several
reasons. The model can be solved analytically in closed form for this welfare function, while the
more general welfare function requires us to use second-order Taylor series approximations. We
found in Devereux and Engel (1998) that the assumption of real balances entering logarithmically
makes little difference for the conclusions on the optimality of fixed vs. floating exchange rates.
We justify the linearity of labor on two grounds. First, some literature has found that when
individuals face a discrete choice of working a fixed number of hours or not working at all, the
appropriate aggregate representation for leisure in the utility function is linear.4 Second, we do not
believe there is a strong tradition in economics of considering the effects of risk-averse behavior
toward uncertainty about consumption of leisure. Risk-neutrality toward leisure is probably a
plausible assumption.5

The preferences of foreign consumers are similar to home country residents’ preferences. The
terms in the utility function involving consumption are identical in the two countries. Note that this
implies that if the law of one price should hold for both goods, then purchasing power parity
obtains: Pt = S t Pt* , where S t is the home-currency price of foreign currency. The functional form
for real balances and labor are also the same, but, for foreign residents, they are functions of foreign
real balances and foreign labor supply.

We assume that there are complete asset markets -- residents of each country can purchase statecontingent nominal bonds. As Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998) emphasize, the structure of the utility
functions ensures that there is complete consumption risk sharing when the law of one price holds,
irrespective of what assets are traded.6 But the law of one price does not hold in the pricing-tomarket model. We consider the assumption of complete asset markets to be convenient, and an
approximation to the assumption of perfect capital mobility.
Given the intratemporal consumption choices above, the budget constraint of the representative
home agent is:
5

The existence of overtime pay, however, suggests that there is some desire to smooth leisure.

8

Pt Ct + M t + ∑z t +1 q(z t +1 , z t ) B( z t +1 ) = Wt Lt + π t + M t −1 + Bt + Tt .
B( z t +1 ) are contingent home-currency denominated nominal bonds whose prices at time t are
q( z t +1 , z t ) , where z t represents the state at time t. π t is the representative agent’s share of profits
from all home firms. Tt represents monetary transfers from the government. Wt is the wage rate.7
In addition to the consumption demand equations, we can derive the money demand equation
for the representative home-country resident:

See Cole and Obstfeld (1991) for an analysis of how the terms of trade changes can serve as a substitute for capital
mobility.
7
To avoid excess notation, we will not continue to use this state-contingent notation from here on. The important
point to remember is that complete asset markets are necessary to sustain the full risk-sharing condition in equation
(1.10) below.

9

There are immediately two important things that arise out of condition (4). First, when the law
of one price holds (as it does in the PCP and FER models defined below), then home consumption
always equals foreign consumption: Ct = C t* .8
Second, the factor price equalization holds. This arises immediately out of equations (3) and
(4), and does not require that the law of one price hold for either good. We have:
Wt = S tWt* .

Government
Government alters the money supply with direct transfers. The government budget constraint
(in per capita terms) is
M t = M t −1 + Tt .

Firms
Here we shall discuss the production and pricing decisions for firms with internationalized
production. Ultimately we will contrast our welfare results in this model with those in Devereux
and Engel (1998). That paper assumes all production by home firms takes place domestically, and
all production by foreign firms takes place in the foreign country.
Firms are assumed to be monopolistic competitors. The production function by the homecountry firm i for sale to domestic residents is given by:
X ht (i ) = Lt (i ) .
So, total output sold to domestic residents by firm i, X ht (i ) , is produced using only labor.
Similarly, the production function for sales to foreign consumers by firm i is given by:
8

It is not necessary that markets be complete to sustain this condition in the PCP model.

10

X ht* (i ) = L*t (i ) .
The objective of the domestic firms is to set prices to maximize the expected utility of the
owners, who are the domestic residents. Firms must set prices before information about the random
domestic and foreign money supplies is known. We will consider three models:
PCP: PCP refers to producer-currency pricing. Producers set the price in their own currency.
The price that foreigners pay for home goods, and the price that home residents pay for foreign
goods fluctuates when the exchange rate changes. This model is examined by Obstfeld and Rogoff
(1995, 1998).
PTM: PTM refers to pricing to market. Producers set the price in the consumers’ currency.
Prices consumers face do not respond to exchange rate changes. A PTM model was introduced by
Devereux and Engel (1998).
FER: FER refers to permanently fixed exchange rates. Prices are set ahead of time, but the
choice of currency is irrelevant since there is essentially a single currency.
No state-contingent pricing is allowed in the three models.
The firm owners maximize the expected present value of profits using the market nominal
discount factor for the owners of the firm. This is equivalent to maximizing expected utility of the
owners. In the PCP model, the firms choose a single price for both markets. Given there is no
intertemporal aspect to the firms’ optimization problems (see, Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998)), this
reduces to maximizing:
Et −1 (d t −1 (( Pht (i ) − Wt ) X ht (i ) + ( Pht (i ) − S tWt * ) X ht* (i ) )).
Given that factor price equalization holds in all of our models, this objective function can be
simplified to:
Et −1 (d t −1 (( Pht (i ) − Wt )( X ht (i ) + X ht* (i ) ))

11

Then, using the fact that home and foreign consumption are equal in the PCP model, the optimal
price set by the home firm is:
λ Et −1 (Ct1− ρWt )
.
Pht (i ) = Pht =
λ − 1 Et −1 (Ct1− ρ )
From equation (3), this price-setting rule can be rewritten as:
 λη  Et −1 ( Pt Ct )
(5) Pht = 
.

1− ρ
 λ − 1  Et −1 (C t )
In a world of certainty, the price would be a mark-up over unit labor costs. Here, there is a risk
premium incorporated in the goods price (as Bacchetta and van Wincoop (1998) and Devereux and
Engel (1998) discuss) arising from the covariance of the firm’s profits with the marginal utility of
consumption.
The law of one price holds for the price charged to foreigners by the home firm:
P
(6) Pht* = ht

St

.

Analogous relationships hold for the prices set by the foreign firms:
* *
 λη  Et −1 ( Pt Ct )
,
(7) Pft* = 

*1− ρ
 λ − 1  Et −1 (Ct )

(8) Pft = S t Pft* .
In the PTM model, the firm chooses two different prices – one for residents of its own country,
and for residents of the other country. The typical home firm maximizes:

[ (

)]

Et −1 d t −1 Pht (i ) X ht (i ) + S t Pht* (i) X ht* (i ) − Wt ( X ht (i ) + X ht* (i )) ,
where we have used factor-price equalization. The price charged by the home firm to the home
residents is the same as in the PCP model, and is given in equation (5). But, making use of the risksharing condition (4), we find the price charged to foreign residents is given by:

12

* *1− ρ

Likewise, the price charged by foreign firms to its own residents is the same as in the PCP model,
and is given by equation (7), but the price charged to home-country consumers in the PTM model
is:
(10)

1− ρ
 λ  Et −1 (C t Wt )  λη  Et −1 ( Pt C t )


1− ρ
1− ρ
 λ − 1  Et −1 (Ct )
 λ − 1  Et −1 (Ct )

Comparing equation (10) to (5), we see that in the PTM model, home residents pay exactly the same
price for the home and the foreign good. Likewise, equations (9) and (7) show that the foreign
resident pays the same price for the two goods (although the prices do not necessarily equal the
price paid by home residents.)
In the FER model, the exchange rate is fixed at all times, so the pricing rule is the same whether
the firms state prices in their own currency or the foreign currency.
Equilibrium in the home market for labor requires that labor employed equal to demand for
home goods and foreign goods by home residents:
(11)

Lt = n

Pt Ct
PC
+ (1 − n ) t t .
Pht
Pft

In both of the models with floating exchange rates, some simplifications of equation (11) are
readily derived. In the PTM model, we note that since Pht = Pft = Pt , we arrive at
(12)

Lt = Ct .

The logic of that relationship is straightforward. Since the relative price of home goods to foreign
goods is always one, and both goods are produced by domestic labor, then the amount of labor
demanded will equal the amount of the good consumed (since the production function is Yt = Lt .)
The expectation of equation (11) can be simplified in the PCP model. From equation (5):
13

(13)

 PC
Et −1  t t
 Pht

 λ −1

Equations (11), (13) and (14) then tell us in the PCP model:
(15)

Et −1 ( Lt ) =

λ −1
Et −1 (Ct1− ρ ) .
λη

These equations suffice to solve the three models. In the next section, we will analyze welfare
under fixed exchange rates, and under the two models of floating exchange rates.

2. Welfare Comparisons
We shall assume the money supply follows a random walk:
(16)

Et ( M t

M t +1

)=µ.

Under these assumptions, it is easy to verify from the money demand equation, (2.2), that
consumption is a function only of the real money supply:
(17)

Ctρ = (

1 − µβ M t
)
.
χ
Pt

An analogous equation holds for the foreign country.
This equation implies that the home and foreign nominal interest rates must be constant. The
gross nominal interest rate is given by the inverse of dt, which is defined is section 1. The ex post
real interest rate is determined by the rate of change of consumption: higher consumption growth is
associated with higher real interest rates.

14

Consider a monetary expansion in the home country under flexible exchange rates. In each of
our models, a monetary expansion lowers the real interest rate. Since money is neutral in the longrun (i.e., after one period), current consumption must grow. A monetary expansion also leads to
expected inflation. The future domestic price level increases more than the current price level in
each of our models. When money enters the utility function logarithmically, the increase in
expected inflation exactly offsets the decline in the real interest rate, leaving the nominal interest
rate unchanged.
It follows immediately that in both the PCP and PTM models, the exchange rate must follow a
random walk. In our model, uncovered interest parity may not hold exactly, because there may be a
foreign exchange risk premium. However, under assumptions that will be introduced shortly
(specifically, that the variance of monetary shocks is constant over time), the risk premium is
constant. Since domestic and foreign interest rates are also constant, the expected change in the
(log of) the nominal exchange rate must be zero. Because money is neutral in the long run, the
current change in the exchange rate is proportional to changes in domestic money (with a positive
sign) and foreign money (with a negative sign.) In fact, from equations (4) and (17):
(18)

St =

M t (1 − µβ )
M t* (1 − µ * β )

.

We can now derive one of the chief results of this section: in the PTM model, foreign monetary
shocks have no effect on domestic consumption, but they do affect home consumption in the PCP
model. Recall that P = Phn Pf1−n . In the PTM model, P is predetermined, so it is not affected by
foreign (or domestic) money shocks. It follows from equation (17) that domestic consumption is
determined in the short-run entirely by the domestic money supply. Changes in the foreign money
supply have no effect on domestic consumption. In contrast, in the PCP model, Pf increases when

15

the price of the foreign currency increases, since that price is fixed in foreign currency terms. So, a
one-percent jump up in the foreign money supply leads to a one-percent decrease in S, a one-percent
decrease in Pf, and a 1 − n percent decline in P. So, a one-percent increase in the foreign money
supply induces a

1− n
percent increase in C.
ρ

We have compared the two floating exchange rate models (PCP and PTM.) How do these
models compare to the fixed-exchange rate (FER) model? To keep exchange rates fixed, the
domestic money supply must move in proportion to the foreign money supply (see equation (18).)
It follows that in response to a one-percent shock to the foreign money supply, the domestic money
supply must change one percent. Since goods prices do not change, equation (17) tells us there
must be a

1
percent change in domestic consumption.
ρ

If our only concern were how the variance of foreign money shocks affected the variance of
domestic consumption, it is clear that floating rates dominate fixed exchange rates. Under fixed
rates, a one percent shock to foreign money leads to a

1
percent changes in domestic consumption,
ρ

compared to a change in domestic consumption of only

1− n
percent in the PCP model; and zero
ρ

percent in the PTM model. Table 1 shows how the variance of (the log of) consumption is related
to the variance of (the log of) the foreign money supply in each model.9

9

These results are derived formally in Appendix 1 in equations (A.9), (A.16) and (A.23)

But, the variance of consumption this is not the only welfare consideration. Even ignoring
the effect on welfare coming from money in the utility function, the variance of foreign monetary
shocks has further effects on utility. Leisure enters utility linearly, so greater variance of output
(and hence leisure) does not directly influence welfare. But, the variance of foreign monetary
shocks has further effects on welfare because it influences the means of both consumption and
leisure. This channel arises from the effects that monetary variances have on goods prices.
We assume shocks to money supplies are log-normally distributed. Using equation (16):
(19)

1
mt +1 − mt = − ln( µ ) + σ m2 + υ t +1 ,
2

where mt is the log of Mt (we will follow the convention that lower-case letters are logs of uppercase letters), υ t +1 is the white-noise shock to domestic money, and σ m2 is the variance of υ t +1 .
An analogous equation holds for the foreign money supply process.
We can write equations (17) and (18) as
(20)

ρct = mt − pt + ln(1 − µβ ) ,
χ

(21)

s t = mt − mt* + ln(1 − µβ ) − ln(1 − µ * β ) .

In log terms, equation (3) can be written as:

17

(22)

wt = pt + ρct + ln(η ) ,

and analogously for the foreign country.
The solutions for goods prices, consumption and leisure depend on the particular model of
price-setting behavior. The Appendix derives solutions in terms of the exogenous variables – the
domestic and foreign money supplies – for each of our models.
The average levels of consumption and leisure can be different depending on the exchange-rate
regime. This may seem surprising, since it implies average long-run consumption depends on a
monetary choice –fixed or floating exchange rates. The intuition for this outcome can be seen from
equation (3). The level of consumption is related to the mark-up of prices over wages: when the
mark-up is smaller, the level of consumption is higher. The level of prices is affected by the
exchange-rate regime because the risk premium incorporated in prices differs between regimes. In
turn, since labor is used to produce consumption goods, the expected level of leisure is also
different under the different exchange-rate regimes.
We compare the influence of the variance of foreign money shocks on the expected level of
consumption by setting the variance of domestic money equal to zero in equations (A.10), (A.18)
and (A.24). These values are reported in Table 2.

From Table 2, the expected level of consumption is higher in the FER model compared to the
PCP model when ρ >

2−n
. A sufficient condition is ρ > 1 . The condition of ρ > 1 is necessary
3 − 2n

and sufficient for expected consumption to be higher in the FER model than in the PTM model.
Although there is little agreement empirically about the correct value for ρ , virtually all studies
agree that ρ > 1 . So, while the variance of consumption is higher for fixed exchange rates than in
either floating exchange rate model, there is a higher average level of consumption under fixed
exchange rates.
This implies a trade-off in utility. Examining for the moment the consumption term alone, using
the fact that consumption is log-normal, we can write:

Welfare is positively related to the expected level of consumption, but falls with increases in the
variance of consumption.

Utility also depends on expected leisure. The greater the average level of employment, the
lower is welfare. Table 3 reports the expected levels of employment in each model (taken from
equations (A.12), (A.18) and (A.26).

Employment is higher under fixed exchange rates, as compared to floating under PCP, when
1< ρ <

2−n
. When n is large (that is, close to one), it is likely that expected employment is
1− n

higher and expected leisure lower under fixed exchange rates. But, for a small country (n close to
zero), average employment under fixed exchange rates will be smaller unless ρ falls in the narrow
range between one and two. So, in comparing leisure effects between FER and PCP, the size of the
country is quite important. On the other hand, expected employment is higher and expected leisure
lower under FER compared to PCP when ρ > 1 .
In comparing welfare under fixed and floating exchange rates, we look at the effects of the
variance of foreign money shocks on domestic welfare. A fixed exchange rate system eliminates

20

the possibility of domestic money shocks, but even under floating rates central banks can choose a
zero variance. So, we set σ m2 = 0 in our welfare analysis.
Real money balances enter the utility function. It may not be wise to evaluate exchange rate
systems in terms of how they affect the real balance part of the utility function. Money in the utility
function is a convenient way to create demand for an asset, money, that would otherwise be
dominated by other assets. But there are other ways to model demand for money that may be more
realistic (and more complicated) that do not involve welfare being directly influenced by holdings
of real balances. In making welfare comparisons, we will assume real balances are not important in
welfare ( χ → 0 ).
Utility, then, can be expressed in terms of expected consumption, the variance of consumption,
and expected leisure. Tables 1, 2 and 3 compare the models for each of these components of utility.
The comparisons seem ambiguous: FER is the worst in terms of the variance of consumption, the
best in terms of expected consumption, and there is some ambiguity about the ranking in terms of
expected leisure. We can further clarify the matter by looking at all three effects together.

PCP vs. FER models
In the PCP and FER models we can use equation (15) to write the welfare expression simply
as a function of the mean and variance of consumption:
(24)

E (u ) =

1 + ρ (λ − 1)
1 + ρ (λ − 1)
 − ρ (1 − ρ ) 2 
E (C 1− ρ ) =
( E (C ))1− ρ ⋅ exp 
σc .
λ (1 − ρ )
λ (1 − ρ )
2



There is a trade-off in choosing between fixed and floating exchange rates. Fixed exchange
rates have a higher expected level of consumption (when ρ >
variance of consumption is lower.

21

2−n
), but under floating rates the
3 − 2n

We find that welfare is higher under floating rates when ρ ≤

2−n
. When ρ ≤ 2 , floating rates
1− n

are always better. As n approaches 1, so that the home country is getting very large relative to the
small country, then floating rates dominate. This accords with the intuition that smaller countries
may find it desirable to fix their exchange rate to the currency of a larger country, but large
countries are better off with their own independent currency.
As ρ increases, the fixed exchange rate system’s advantage in terms of expected consumption
increases. Its disadvantage in terms of variance also falls as the square of ρ increases, although that
is offset by the fact that the importance of the variance in welfare rises with the square of ρ (see
equation (24).) On net, for large values of ρ , fixed exchange rates become more desirable.

PTM vs. FER Models
We have seen from Table 1 that foreign monetary variance does not affect either the mean or
variance of consumption in the PTM model. Compared to the FER model, the variance of
consumption is lower, but the mean of consumption is also lower when ρ > 1 . The PTM model has
the advantage in terms of expected leisure when ρ > 1 .
As is the case with the PCP and FER models (equation (15)), we have E ( L) =

λ −1
E (C 1− ρ ) .
λη

In the PTM model, this follows from equations (12) and (A.14). So, conveniently, the analysis
simplifies to a comparison of the models in terms of expected consumption and the variance of
consumption. Equation (24) holds in the PTM model as well as the other two models.
Utility in the PTM model is not influenced by foreign monetary policy shocks. We can
derive:

22

 λ −1
E (u PTM ) = 

 ηλ 

1− ρ

ρ

 1 + ρ ( λ − 1) 

This can be compared directly to welfare in the FER model:

 λ (1 − ρ ) 

It is clear from examination of these equations that any variance in foreign money shocks lowers
welfare in the FER model, so
E (u PTM ) > E (u FER )
for all admissible parameter values. Even though, when ρ > 1 , there may be less expected
consumption under floating exchange rates and PTM, the fact that home consumption is completely
insulated from foreign money shocks is enough to insure that floating rates always dominate fixed
exchange rates in this model.

3. How Internationalized Production Matters
How do the comparisons between levels of welfare under fixed and floating exchange rates in
the models of this paper, with internationalized production, relate to the comparisons in Devereux
and Engel (1998) where there is no internationalized production?
There are surprising similarities in the welfare comparisons. A major reason why the welfare
comparisons are not very different whether or not we assume internationalized production is that
there is factor price equalization in our model. Since home-country wages equal foreign-country
wages, the prices set by firms are the same whether or not domestic labor or foreign labor produces
output. That is, there is a risk premium incorporated in nominal goods prices arising from the

23

covariance of labor costs with revenues. But, that risk is the same whether domestic or foreign
labor is employed because the two types of labor are paid the same wage.
Why is there factor-price equalization? From equation (3), the marginal utility of taking one
more dollar’s worth of leisure,

consumption,

η
, is equal to the marginal utility from one more dollar’s worth of
Wt

Ct− ρ
. That is, each agent only works so much that the last dollar earned creates as
Pt

much utility from consumption as it does disutility from working. But, our assumption of perfect
capital mobility and complete nominal asset markets means that the marginal utility of a dollar for
C t− ρ C t*− ρ
. Together, these
the home-country resident is worth the same for the foreigh agent:
=
Pt
S t Pt *
imply that the dollar value of wages must be the same in the two countries: Wt = S tWt* . In short,
the complete asset markets in nominal bonds assures that the marginal value of a dollar spend on
leisure is the same in the two countries:

η
η
=
.
Wt S tWt*

Since wage equalization implies that the nominal price set by firms is not affected by the
location of production, then neither exchange rates nor consumption levels (from equation (17)) are
affected by the location of production. So, any welfare comparison involving consumption is not
influenced by whether or not there is internationalized production.
Welfare is also influenced by leisure. One would expect that term to be different depending on
where production is located. In Devereux and Engel (1998), domestic workers produce goods
consumed by foreigners, so movements in foreign demand for domestic goods change employment.
But, in the model of this paper, domestic workers produce only for domestic consumption: they
produce both the home and foreign goods for home consumers.

24

Surprisingly, in the PCP model, even the leisure term is not affected by the location of
production. In the PCP model, as Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998) emphasize, the current account is
always balanced. Even though there is perfect capital mobility, the unitary elasticity of demand
between foreign and domestic consumption combined with the law of one price assumption ensures
that the value of goods purchased from abroad by home residents continuously equals the value of
goods sold to foreign residents by home firms. But, the prices of home goods and foreign goods are
expected to be the same (prior to the realization of monetary shocks.) Since the value of exports
and imports are equal, and the expected prices are the same, the expected quantity of goods home
firms produce for foreign residents always equals the expected quantity of goods foreign firms
produce for home residents. So, it does not matter where the goods are produced – expected
employment will not be affected by the location of production.
Welfare in the PCP model is not affected by the presence of internationalized production.
The same is true for the FER model, since given the structure of the model, the FER model is
identical to the PCP model with n = 1 . The welfare comparisons for this paper between the PCP
and FER worlds are exactly the same as in Devereux and Engel (1998) for these two models.
Expected leisure in the PTM model does depend on where output is produced. In the model of
this paper, where domestic labor only produces for home consumers, there is no influence of foreign
money shocks on expected employment. In the model of Devereux and Engel (1998), foreign
money shocks change domestic employment because they affect foreign demand for home goods
(which, in that model, are produced with domestic labor.) In that model, when ρ > 1 , a higher
foreign monetary variance raises expected demand for home goods and lowers expected home
leisure. So, expected domestic leisure is higher when there is internationalized production. Still,

25

whether or not there is internationalized production, floating rates in the PTM model always yield
higher expected utility than fixed exchange rates.

4. Conclusions
We find that the hypothesis of how prices are set has implications for the optimal choice of
exchange-rate regime. If we follow the traditional literature in assuming that prices are set in
producers’ currencies, and that the law of one price holds, there is no clear-cut answer on which
regime is preferable. When a country is small, or very risk averse, it would prefer fixed exchange
rates; otherwise, floating exchange rates are preferred.
However, the empirical evidence supports the model of pricing in which producers set different
prices in different markets. Prices are set in consumers’ currencies and adjust slowly to demand
shocks. In that case, we find that floating exchange rates are unambiguously preferred to fixed
exchange rates.
That conclusion is not altered by incorporating internationalized production in the model.
Indeed, we find under pricing to market that the economy is even more sheltered from foreign
shocks in a floating exchange rate system then in a world where all production of the domestic firm
takes place in the home country. The reason is straightforward: one potential avenue for foreign
shocks to hit the home economy is through employment changes in response to changes in foreign
demand for the home good. If a monetary shock abroad changes foreign demand for the home
good, that may alter domestic employment. But, to the extent that the foreign demand is met by
production by foreign subsidiaries of the home country, domestic employment is sheltered from the
foreign shock. So, one avenue through which foreign shocks could affect domestic employment

26

and welfare under a floating exchange rate system with pricing to market is closed when the home
good is produced internationally.
The model considered here is quite simple. We only look at a special case examined by
Devereux and Engel (1998), in which real money balances enter the utility function logarithmically
and leisure enters linearly. This specification simplifies the analysis considerably. For example,
nominal interest rates are constant in equilibrium. But, it also loses some of the interesting and
more realistic dynamic behavior of the more complex models. Still, in Devereux and Engel (1998),
the flavor of the welfare analysis of exchange-rate regimes was not appreciably altered by
consideration of the more complex model.
One important extension to this model would allow for price-adjustment that lasts longer than a
single period. Indeed, it is possible that the speed of price adjustment could differ between
exchange-rate regimes, and that could alter the welfare analysis. We would also like to consider
investment questions. In this study, internationalized production is undertaken using only foreign
labor as an input. More interesting would be an analysis that allowed for domestically-owned
capital to be combined with foreign labor in producing output for sale abroad.
We are not certain which direction these extensions would tilt the welfare analysis. But, this
study has highlighted some differences in the exchange-rate systems, and the roles of price-setting
and internationalized production, that would be important in any extended model.

Appendix

Recall that the pricing formulas for Pht and Pft* are the same in all three models. Using the fact
that prices and consumption will be log-normally distributed in equilibrium, we can write equation (5)
as:
(A.1) pht = mt −1 − ln( µ ) + σ m2 + (1 − ρ )σ mc + ln( λη (1 − µβ )

χ (λ − 1)

),

where σ mc is the covariance of mt and ct conditional on t − 1 information. (In general, we will use the
notation σ xz to denote Covt −1 ( x t , z t ) , and σ z2 to denote Vart −1 ( z t ) .) Similar derivations yield from
equation (7):
(A.2)

*
p *ft = mt*−1 − ln( µ * ) + σ m2 * + (1 − ρ )σ m*c* + ln( λη (1 − µ β )

χ ( λ − 1)

).

Equations (A.1) and (A.2) hold in all three models. We will also use the relationship
(A.3)

pt = npht + (1 − n ) p ft ,

and the analogous expression for the foreign price level. These equations must be augmented by
equations for p ft and p ht* , as well as equations for output, in order to complete derivations in each
model.

A.1

The PCP Model
The law of one price holds in this model, so

(A.4)

p ft = st + p *ft ,

(A.5)

pht* = pht − st .

Recall, also, the perfect risk-sharing property of this model, so that
ct = ct* .

Then, using (21), (A.2), (A.3) and (A.4), we can derive for the domestic price level

λη (1 − µβ )

(A.6) pt = mt − n(υ t − σ m2 − (1 − ρ )σ mc ) − (1 − n)(υ t* − σ m2 * − (1 − ρ )σ m*c ) + ln(

The PTM Model
From equations (5) and (10), we see that Pft and Pht are equal. Using this fact, and the definition

of the price index in equation (1), we have:
(A.13) Pft = Pht = Pt =

ηλ Et −1 ( Pt C t )
.
λ − 1 Et −1 (C t1− ρ )

But, since Pt is in the time t-1 information set, equation (A.13) gives us that
(A.14) Et −1 (C t1− ρ ) =

ηλ
Et −1 (C t ) .
λ −1

As compared to the PCP model (equation (A.9)), domestic monetary variance has a greater effect on
the variance of domestic consumption. Substituting into equation (A.15), we get

FER Model
We will assume the exchange rate is fixed at 1, so st = 0 for all t. From equation (21) it follows

that
(A.20) mt + ln(1 − µβ ) = mt* + ln(1 − µ * β ) .
The domestic money supply moves in reaction to foreign money supply shocks in order to keep the
exchange rate fixed.
Because exchange rates are fixed, Pft = Pft* and Pht = Pht* . We can use equations (A.1) and (A.2) to
derive expressions for prices. Noting that all prices are preset, the money demand equation (20)
(combined with relation (A.20)) tells us
