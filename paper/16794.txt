Occupational Status and Health Transitions

NBER Working Paper No. 16794
February 2011
JEL No. I1,I12
ABSTRACT
We use longitudinal data from the 1984 through 2007 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
to examine how occupational status is related to the health transitions of 30 to 59 year-old U.S. males.
A recent history of blue-collar employment predicts a substantial increase in the probability of transitioning
from very good into bad self-assessed health, relative to white-collar employment, but with no evidence
of occupational differences in movements from bad to very good health. These findings are robust
to a series of sensitivity analyses. The results suggest that blue-collar workers “wear out” faster with
age because they are more likely, than their white-collar counterparts, to experience negative health
shocks. This partly reflects differences in the physical demands of blue-collar and white-collar jobs.

Occupational Status and Health Transitions
Introduction
Empirical research shows that physically demanding jobs are related to lower levels of
health. However, these results provide little indication about why health differs across
occupations or about how such differences are generated. A particular gap in our knowledge
involves how occupations might affect the timing of health changes, especially transitions into
and out of poor health. Information on these linkages could improve our understanding of the
mechanisms that lead to the association between occupation and health. Towards this end, we
examine how an individual’s occupational history is related to the probability of transitioning
between health states. Specifically, we focus on how health transitions are related to employment
in blue-collar, white-collar, and service occupations; we also consider differentials related to the
physical demands of occupations.
Occupational status could have asymmetric effects on health transitions – for example,
some occupations may be associated with relatively high probabilities of downward movements
in health but without a corresponding increase in health improvements. Consider the extreme
case of irreversible health changes. Occupationally influenced health investments might protect
against or mitigate the likelihood that such shocks take place (and so reduce the probability of
downwards health transitions) but would have no effect once such shocks occur (and so would
be unrelated to the likelihood of health improvements). Alternatively, once an individual
experiences a negative (but not irreversible) health shock his occupation may hinder his ability to
offset these deleterious effects with investment. The estimation method employed below allows
for such asymmetric effects.
Using data on men’s occupational and health histories from the 1984 through 2007 waves

1

of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we create summary histories of occupation and
health status over a five-year window and examine how these are related to health two years
later. Consistent with prior research, the health of blue-collar workers is found to decline with
age faster than that of white-collar workers. What is new, however, is that we further show that
this is a consequence of blue-collar employees having a greater likelihood of transitioning from
very good to bad health but with no difference in the relative probability that they move from
bad to very good health. Similarly, periods out of work or in service jobs predict relatively high
rates of negative health transitions without an offsetting rise in the relative likelihood of health
improvements. These findings suggest that differences in rates of negative health shocks play a
primary role in explaining age-related occupational gradients in health. These qualitative results
are robust to several sensitivity analyses are unlikely to reflect differential patterns of errors in
self-reports of health status. We also show that heterogeneity in occupation-related physical
demands may explain some of the observed patterns.

Conceptual Issues and Previous Literature
In models of health capital, individuals make health investments to optimize healthy time
available to work and earn income, and this health capital can be used in combination with or as
a substitute for financial and traditional human capital (Grossman, 1972; Muurinen and Le
Grand, 1985). The health capital framework is also informative when considering health
transitions, since the stock of health capital at a point in time depends on health in the prior
period, investment flows, predictable depreciation in the health stock and (with uncertainty),
stochastic shocks resulting from illness, accidents and the like.
This framework identifies several reasons why occupational status may be related to
health. First, persons in highly paid occupations have more ability to finance health investments

2

and greater incentives to undertake them (since periods of poor health impose higher opportunity
costs). Second, workers in some occupations may have differential access to information related
to health behaviors or methods of alleviating health problems. Third, peer effects may be
important and could differ across occupations due to variation in coworker characteristics.
Fourth, the rate of health depreciation is likely to be heterogeneous, being particularly high, for
example, in physically demanding jobs. Finally, the rate of stochastic health events may vary; for
instance, negative shocks will be especially common in occupations with high accident rates.
Several of these sources of occupational disparities could affect health transitions
differently than overall (average) health status. Most obviously, health shocks due to accidents
cause downward movements in health that could either be transitory or permanent (depending on
the nature of the injury). Such shocks, if temporary, increase the volatility of health but need not
change long-run average status. In this case, occupations with high accident rates will be
characterized by large frequencies of both favorable and unfavorable health transitions.
Conversely, accidents that permanently reduce health will have asymmetric effects, increasing
negative health transitions without a corresponding rise in health improvements.
Economists have recently started to examine how occupational status and health are
related. Fletcher and Sindelar (2009) show that entry into the labor force initiated with a bluecollar (rather than white-collar) job, is associated with significantly lower health at older ages –
equivalent to an average seven year increase in age (for persons 30 and older) in OLS models
and an even greater amount in IV specifications. However, mechanisms for this relationship are
not examined: the maintained hypothesis is that a person’s first occupation sets the trajectory of
future job conditions, income, and consumption patterns, which affect health. Fletcher, Sindelar
and Yamaguchi (forthcoming) provide evidence that exposure (during the previous five years) to
physically demanding jobs and work-related environmental hazards are cumulatively harmful to

3

health: a one standard deviation increase in physical demands is associated with a health
decrement for nonwhite men equivalent to a two-year reduction in schooling or four additional
years of age (with smaller effects for white males). Cross-sectional analyses for the U.S. (Case
and Deaton, 2005) and Canada (Choo and Denny, 2006) indicate that health depreciates faster
with age for individuals in manual than non-manual occupations, suggesting that occupations
have cumulative effects on health and alter its trajectory over the life course.
However, prior research does not examine how occupational status is related to health
transitions. The study of such transitions, which we undertake, is interesting in its own right and
potentially informative for understanding differences in age-related health gradients. As
discussed, blue-collar jobs are likely to have relatively high rates of accidents. These could result
in large but temporary deteriorations in health – implying relatively high probabilities of both
entering and exiting poor health – or permanent health decrements, so that blue-collar workers
disproportionately transition into but not out of poor health. Alternatively, downward mobility in
health might be similar across occupations, but blue-collar workers might have more difficulty
restoring good health, resulting in a relative deterioration for them at older ages. Our analysis
focuses on examining these potentially asymmetric health transitions across occupations. For the
most part, we will not explain why the transitions differ – that represents an important topic for
future research. However, we will provide some indication of the role played by the physical job
demands.

Methodology
We estimate dynamic models that allow us to examine how occupational status is
differentially (and possibly asymmetrically) associated with transitions from better to worse
health and vice versa. Let ht represent self-reported health status in year t for a given person.

4

Most of our analyses consider a binary indicator where ht takes a value of one if the person
reports being in “good,” “fair,” or “poor” health (which we label below as “bad” health) and zero
if the person reports being in “very good” or “excellent” health (denoted as “very good” health).
have is average self-reported health measured over some previous period (t, t-2 and t-4 in most of
the analysis); OCCave is a vector that representing either occupational history over the five-years
ending in period t, or particular characteristics of that history; Xt is a vector of observed and
possibly time-varying personal characteristics; and εt is an error term that encompasses
unobserved characteristics. The basic model we estimate is described by:

θ

γ

βX

.

(1)

In (1), estimated values of δ, θ, and γ indicate how health at time t+2 is related to the person’s
initial health status and occupational history.
Models that incorporate occupational histories have been estimated in previous studies;
however, our specifications further allow occupational status to have different associations with
transitions into and out of bad health. For people with a recent history of very good health, θ
describes how occupational status is associated with downwards health transitions. For people
with a history of bad health, δ, θ, and γ indicate how occupational status is associated with
movements into better health. The interpretations can be more complicated because have, which
averages health status over several years, can take values between zero and one.
We estimate (1) as a linear probability model throughout, for convenience and ease of
interpretation.1 The longitudinal design of the PSID provides the health and occupational history

Preliminary analysis revealed similar patterns of coefficients and statistical significance when using probit
specifications, but the linear probability (LP) coefficients are easier to interpret, especially when including the
occupation-health interactions (Ai and Norton, 2003).

information needed to estimate the model but also leads to multiple observations for most of our
sample members. Therefore, the estimates below present robust standard errors clustered at the
individual level.

Data
Our data on men’s health and careers come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics,
which began surveying “heads” and “wives” of a national sample of 4,800 families in 1968,
focusing on the economic and income behavior of the family.2 The PSID has followed these
families, including original sample members and their children when they establish independent
households. Interviews were conducted annually through 1997 and biennially thereafter.
In each panel since 1984, the PSID has asked heads and spouses: “Would you say your
health in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” Self-reported overall health status
is a widely used summary measure that predicts subsequent mortality (Idler and Benyamini,
1997; Mossey and Shapiro, 1982) and is correlated with indicators of morbidity (Manor,
Matthews, and Power, 2001; Miilunpalo et al., 1997). While the measure has many advantages,
there are also limitations that should be kept in mind. One shortcoming that is relevant for
studies with employment outcomes is that self-reported health measures sometimes suffer from
“justification” bias – reporting health problems to explain poor labor force results (Currie and
Madrian, 1999). However, this bias is unlikely to depend upon the type of employment, unlike
self-reports of health-related work limitations, and the relationship between SHS and objective
health measures (like mortality) does not appear to vary between manual and non-manual
workers (McFadden et al., 2009).

2

Family “heads” are defined as the primary financial contributor to a PSID family, but defaults to the male partner
of a female primary financial contributor if the male is a husband or has cohabited with the “wife” for at least a year.

6

As described earlier, we dichotomize men’s SHS into “bad” health (SHS is good, fair, or
poor) and “very good” health (SHS is excellent or very good). Nearly our entire sample is
observed to be in very good or excellent health at least once. The use of “good” health as a cutoff means that many of our sample members are also observed in the lower health category;
however, the results below are robust to using “fair” health as the dividing line.
We measure a person’s health history as a simple average of the binary health indicator
over the preceding five years (i.e., the proportion of surveys over a preceding five years when the
person reported “bad” health). To accommodate the PSID change to biennial surveying after
1997, our primary measure averages data from t, t – 2, and t – 4 (ignoring data from t – 1 and t –
3 that are available in some but not all years). For example, if the person reported bad health in
two of the three survey periods over the previous five years, the health history variable would
equal 0.667. As sensitivity tests, we investigated alternative health history variables including
one that contains data for all five years—including periods t – 1 and t – 3 when available—as
well as shorter three- and one-year histories. These changes did not alter our results.
Our analysis examines how occupational status and the physical demands of occupations
are associated with health transitions. To form the relevant measures, we consider reports
regarding the occupation of the main job held by the household head at the time of each
interview and the main job occupation held one year prior to the time of the interview in the
years when biennial surveys were conducted. The original 3-digit occupation codes were
reclassified, using the procedures detailed in Appendix A, to distinguish between “blue-collar,”
“white-collar” and “service” occupations, as well as periods of non-employment. These broad
occupational designations are assumed to capture some shared job characteristics, most
especially physical demands but also possibly work environments and autonomy in work
conditions. “White-collar” occupations mostly include jobs in offices, including managers and

7

professionals, who often have a high degree of autonomy. The “blue-collar” occupations
generally include production work and tend to be more physically demanding. “Service”
occupations include some physically demanding jobs, such as protective service workers, but
also some positions with fewer physical demands, such as personal service workers. Blue-collar
and service workers generally enjoy less autonomy than white-collar workers.
These characterizations of positions are inexact. For example, the white-collar category
includes sales occupations, which might occur outside an office and involve little autonomy, and
the blue-collar category includes machine operators, who might have few physical demands.
Because of these issues, we also consider alternative classifications used in previous studies. In
some analyses, we follow Fletcher and Sindelar (2009) in considering differences between bluecollar employees and all other workers (i.e., not distinguishing between white-collar and service
jobs). In other specifications, we follow Case and Deaton (2005) by considering managers and
professionals as one category and combining the remaining white-collar jobs with service
occupations into another category.
A more direct way to describe the conditions of employment is in terms of specific job
characteristics, rather than occupational groups. The core PSID interviews do not ask about these
characteristics; however, it is possible to map occupational codes to characteristics typical of
those occupations. We do this for one especially relevant characteristic—the physical demands
of the job. Using data from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) and methods described
in Appendix A, occupations were classified on a five point scale where one indicates
“Sedentary” jobs and a five was assigned to those requiring “Very Heavy Work.” Consistent
with expectations, occupation-based physical demands were highest in blue collar jobs and
lowest in white collar occupations, with service employment being between the two–using the
five-point scale physical demands averaged 2.9, 2.5 and 1.6 for blue-collar, service, and white-

8

collar workers in our sample.3
For our primary multivariate analyses, we measure the recent history of occupational
status or characteristics by taking the average of the relevant year-specific measures over the
preceding five years. For example, to describe the recent history of blue collar work, we create a
measure that represents the proportion of the previous five years that the person was employed in
a blue collar occupation. Similarly, to describe the recent physical demands, we take the average
of the physical demand measures over the last five years. In sensitivity analyses, we
experimented with slightly shorter and longer averaging windows and found that the results are
robust to these changes.
Our multivariate analyses include other relevant explanatory variables. A key
determinant of health is a person’s age, which we measure in years. To control for racial
differences in health, we include binary indicators for being black and for being neither black nor
white (the omitted category for these indictors is men who are white). Educational differences
are accounted for through binary indicators for: not completing high school, graduating high
school (or getting a GED) but without college, attending college but without obtaining a
bachelor’s degree, and completing a bachelor’s degree (or more education). We further
distinguish between men who were married and unmarried at the time of the survey and include
a general set of year dummy variables to account for trends in economic, social, health, and
policy conditions. The log of the family’s annual income is also included in some analyses.
Another issue arising in the PSID is that each year’s reports come from one respondent,
so that wives may sometimes be reporting the health status of their husbands. Our analyses
include a binary indicator for such proxy reporting. We have also conducted analyses that were
3

The physical demands variable should be interpreted cautiously because the measure averages some jobs within a
three-digit occupational category, because the measure is ordinal rather than cardinal, and because occupational
characteristics change over time.

9

limited to men who were respondents with no substantial change in the results.
Our initial sample is restricted to 30 to 59 year-old male heads of households observed
after the PSID started collecting the self-reported health status information. The lower end of this
age restriction allows us to examine occupational effects after individuals have had time to amass
appreciable work histories. At the upper end, we stop our observations before most people retire
but after most have experienced at least some bad health. Indeed, 79 percent of our sample is
reported to be in bad health at least once during the observation period. Our observations are
further limited to years in which the men report not being in or having recently served in the
armed forces. Finally, we restrict the sample to observations with complete information for
seven-year span of health data (from t-4 to t+2) and the other explanatory measures. The final
principal analysis sample includes 34,607 person-years of information from 5,611 men. The
absence of females from our analysis represents a significant limitation that partially results from
the less complete data typically available for them but represents an important topic for future
research.

Descriptive Analyses
Table 1 lists the means for our analysis variables for all of the person-year observations
in our sample and conditionally for men reporting different health histories and transitions.
Thirty-nine percent of the person-year observations occurred in years where the men reported
being in bad health. When we consider the men’s recent histories of bad health (the average from
t, t – 2, and t – 4), the proportion of recent years of bad health drops slightly to 36 percent, which
is consistent with health gradually worsening with age.4 Our sample is composed mostly of

4

Other things held constant, there is a smaller chance that the men will be in bad health four years prior to the
current interview year than in the interview year itself.

10

observations for white-collar workers (44 percent) and blue-collar workers (39 percent), with
relatively few observations of service workers (6 percent) or non-working men (11 percent). The
demographic composition reflects the initial design of the PSID, which oversampled poor
households in its first sample in 1968. In particular, black men are over-represented and males
who are neither black nor white are under-represented. The average age is 42 years, and more
than five-sixths of the observations are of married men. The sample includes men with a range of
educational attainments.
Considering health status in periods t and t + 2, approximately half of the observations
represent continuations of very good self-reported health (16,893 out of 34,607), just over a
quarter of the observations come from continuations of bad health, leaving a quarter that
represent transitions between the health states. Thus, while changes in reported health status are
less frequent than continuations, there are still a substantial number of transitions. In particular,
there were 4,359 transitions from very good health to bad health, which implies a transition rate
of 21 percent, and 3,605 transitions from bad health to very good health, which implies a
transition rate of 27 percent.
Several occupational associations are also apparent in Table 1. Men with recent histories
of blue-collar work are under-represented in the observations with continuations of good health
but over-represented in other health patterns. This indicates that blue-collar work is associated
with a higher rate of transitioning to bad health and with being in bad health but not with moving
into very good health. In contrast, white-collar workers are over-represented in the observations
with continuations of very good health and under-represented in those with continuations of bad
health. The pattern suggests that white-collar workers have lower rates of transitioning into bad
health and higher rates of moving into very good health. The representation of service workers
does not vary substantially across the transition groups, suggesting that service jobs are not

11

strongly associated with health or health transitions. The pattern of results for the recent histories
of physically-demanding jobs is consistent with those for the broad occupational categories.
Workers continuing in very good health had the least physically-demanding recent job histories;
those continuing in bad health had the most physically-demanding employment histories. In the
next section of the paper, we re-examine these relationships using multivariate models that
account for possible confounding influences of other observed characteristics.

Multivariate Results
In the following, we discuss the estimated effects of occupational history on the
probability of transitioning into and out of bad health from a history of very good and bad health,
respectively. Estimates from four linear probability specifications are reported in Table 2. As
described in equation (1), each includes controls for the recent health history, the recent
occupational history (the proportion of years working in blue-collar jobs, service jobs, and not
working), and interactions of the health and occupational histories. All of the models also control
for age, race, marital status, and general year effects, although for brevity, we only report the
coefficients for age. All columns except for the second also hold constant educational
attainment. The third and fourth columns also control for household income, with the last column
also adding occupation-specific age profiles.
In these specifications, the coefficients on the uninteracted occupational measures can be
directly interpreted as the conditional associations of occupational status with transitions from
very good health to bad health. The corresponding associations of occupational status with
transitions in the other direction, from bad health to very good health, can be determined by
combining the coefficients on recent health status, recent occupational histories, and their
interactions. While these coefficients are reported, we have also combined the relevant

12

coefficients into summary measures of how of occupational status predicts transitions into very
good health. These are reported in the bottom panel of Table 2.
The estimates from the multivariate specifications are broadly consistent with
occupational differences in health transitions from the descriptive analyses. In the specification
reported in the first column with educational controls but no income controls, men whose recent
experience has been entirely in blue-collar work are estimated to face a 4.8 percent greater
chance of transitioning from very good to bad health than men whose recent experience has been
entirely in white-collar work. Men whose recent expericence has been entirely in service work
rather than white-collar also face higher rates of transitions into bad health, as do men who have
not been employed over the preceding five years.5
Estimates of the occupational differences in probabilities of transitioning between bad
and very good health (which are calculated by taking the negative of the sum of the interacted
and uniteracted occupational effects) are reported are reported in the lower panel of Table 2.
Results from the specification in the first column indicate that the probabilities of exiting bad
health for men with histories of blue-collar and service work do not differ significantly from the
probabilities for those with histories of white-collar work. However, men in bad health who have
not been employed appear to be less likely to transition back to very good health than other men.
These patterns of results are robust when we alter the controls in the models. The relative
probabilities of downwards health transitions for blue-collar, service and nonemployed workers
become stronger compared to those in white-collar jobs when education is excluded from the
model (column 2). There are also changes in the estimated occupational differences in the
probabilities of transitioning from bad health to very good health, although there are no changes
5

The estimated effect of non-employment is difficult to interpret for two reasons. First, non-employment is highly
endogenous to self-reported health for men in the sample age range (Currie and Madrian, 1999). Second, for
observations with any observed non-employment (in the previous five years), fewer than 5 percent are nonemployed for more than half of the period.

13

in the statistical significance of the results. Positive correlations between education and health
have been widely observed (Grossman and Kaestner, 1997), and it seems likely that schooling
provides some protection against downwards movements in health. Given that education is
correlated with occupational status, it is not surprising that the predicted occupational effects on
negative health transitions become stronger when deleting education controls. Because the
general implications do not change when excluding education as a covariate, we follow the
previous empirical economics literature and control for education in all other specifications.
The third column of Table 2 lists results from a specification that adds the log of total
household income in period t as a control variable.6 The estimated occupational differences in
the probability of transitioning from very good health to bad health are slightly smaller than the
estimated differences in the first column. Men with a history of blue-collar employment are still
4.3 percentage points more likely to move from very good to bad health, relative their whitecollar counterparts. Similarly, the estimated difference for men with a work history in service
jobs is relatively close to the original estimate, at an increase of 3.0 percentage points in the
probability of entering bad health. As for exiting bad health, there are still no statistically
significant differences between men with blue-collar or service occupational histories and those
in white-collar jobs, while the differential associated with non-employment shrinks in size and
loses statistical significance. In general, results from this specification indicate that income plays
a partial mediating role between occupational status and health outcomes but that other sizeable
associations still remain.
Specification (4) adds interactions between the employment history variables and a linear
age trend, allowing health trajectories to differ with age across occupational types. If
occupational status is associated with the general age profile of health, we might expect to see
6

We have also used total household income averaged over the 5-year period without a substantive change in results.

14

differences in these interactions rather than the transition terms. However, the interactions
between occupational status and age are not statistically significant and occupational differences
continue to appear in health transitions.

Sensitivity Tests
We have re-estimated our models using several alternative specifications of our health
and occupational history measures. Selected results from these alternative specifications are
reported in Table 3. The specifications in Table 3 generally have the same auxiallary controls as
the first specification in Table 2 (i.e., they include controls for age, race, marital status, proxy
reporting, education, and year effects but omit controls for income or occupation-specific age
effects). Table 3 reports coefficients on the differences between workers in blue-collar and
white-collar occupations in their transitions into and out of bad health.
The first three specifications in Table 3 incorporate alternative measures of our health
history variable. Recall that for reasons of consistency over different years of the PSID, our
recent health history measure includes observations from periods t – 4, t – 2, and t but not
periods t – 3 or t – 1, even when those observations are available. The initial specification in
Table 3 includes all of the available observations in the health history measure. However, there is
almost no change in the estimated results.
In the next two rows, we report results from models that use different reporting lengths to
define the person’s initial health status. One reason for combining several years of health data
into a single summary measure is to reduce some of the noise associated with the wave-to-wave
measures. However, the resulting summary measure may introduce problems of its own by
including health reports from several years ago that may not be relevant at the time of the
interview. Also, if an individual is in bad health for the full time of the five-year window, it may

15

be the case that the health persistence is too strong to identify any differences across
occupational types. To investigate differing health histories, we consider two specifications that
use shorter health history measures: one specification uses data from periods t – 2 and t, while
the other uses information only from period t. Our findings remain robust. The estimated
differences between the probabilities of blue-collar and white-collar workers transitioning to bad
health become slightly stronger when we condition on shorter histories of health. The estimated
differences in the probabilities of transitioning to very good health do not change. The change in
relative probability of transitioning into but not out of bad health provides evidence against one
concern of this study, occupationally related measurement error in self-reported health status. If
the level of measurement error in self-reported health, uninformative movement between health
categories, is greater for individuals in blue-collar occupations then we might expect to see
greater probabilities of transitioning between better and worse health states when we condition
on shorter measures of health history for this group. The fact that we see a greater probability of
transitioning into bad health but no change in the probability of transitioning out of that status
when the shorter health history measures are used suggests that differences in the probability of
transitions are not simply due to the correlation of measurement error in the health variable with
occupational types.
The next row in Table 3 lists results from a specification that defines “bad” health at a
different point in the SHS scale. In particular, we re-specify the cut-off for bad health more
stringently as reporting “fair” or “poor” SHS, rather than “good,” “fair,” or “poor.” Even with
the stricter definition, blue-collar workers are estimated to face a higher risk of a negative health
transition than white-collar workers. Consisent, however, with the lower overall probability of
experiencing “fair” or “poor” health, the size of the differential is reduced from our previous
specifications. The differences between blue-collar and white-collar workers in their

16

probabilities of transitioning to better health remain statistically insignificant but mainly due to
an imprecise estimate.
The fifth row of Table 3 lists results from a specification that uses bad health in either
period t + 2 or t + 4 as the dependent variable, rather than bad health in only period t + 2. The
additional time to switch health states increases the differences between white-collar and bluecollar work histories in the probability of entering bad health from very good health. Yet, there
is still no discernable difference between the probability of exiting bad health for men with blueand white-collar work histories.
The remaining rows of Table 3 report results from models that use alternative
occupational history measures and contrasts. The first of these specifications drops the controls
for service occupations. This has the effect of combining service workers and white-collar
workers into a single (omitted) category. A similar contrast was examined by Fletcher and
Sindelar (2009) in their study of initial occupational choices. The change in the occupational
measures has almost no effect, however, on the estimated associations. The stability of the
estimates most likely results from the very low incidence of service work in our sample.
In the seventh row of Table 3, we list estimates from a model that combines service,
sales, and administrative workers into a single occupational category. Thus, the omitted
occupational group in the models becomes a narrower group of professional and managerial
workers. Once again, however, there are few substantive changes in the results.
The final row in Table 3 lists results from a regression that replaces the blue-collar and
service occupational measures with the five-year average physical demands variable. The results
confirm the previous findings that more manual occupations are related to a greater probability
of transitioning into bad health given a history of very good health and no significant difference
in the probability of transitioning into better health from bad health.

17

The variables for occupational histories and physical demands are measured in different
units; however, it is possible to make a rough comparison of the estimated effects. The average
physical demands of a blue-collar occupation in our sample are 1.3 units greater than the average
physical demands of a white-collar occupation. If we apply this adjustment factor, five years of
employment with the average physical demands of a blue-collar job would increase the
probabilty of transitioning to bad health by 2.1 percentage points relative to employment with the
average physical demands of a white-collar job. The calculation indicates that physical demands
can account for almost half of the differential in transitions between very good and bad health
between blue- and white-collar workers.

Conclusion
We use longitudinal data on men’s health and occupational histories, from the PSID, to
examine how occupational status is asociated with health and health transitions. Previous
research indicates that health varies by occupation and that this heterogeneity increases with age.
However, since health does not not simply decline over the life-course—with both health
decrements and improvements occurring frequently—we estimate models that identify
relationships between occupational history and the probabilities of transitioning between both
better and worse health for U.S. working age males.
The results show that a recent (five year) history of blue-collar employment predicts a
four-to-five percentage point increase in the probability of moving from very good (“very good”
or “excellent”) into bad (“poor”, “fair”, or “good”) self-assessed health, relative to white-collar
employment. However, there are no indications that blue-collar work differentially affects the
probability of transitioning out of worse health. Education and income are positively related to
health, as in previous studies, but their inclusion does not eliminate the observed occupational

18

effects.
These findings are robust to a series of sensitivity analyses and do not appear to reflect
errors in the reporting of self-assessed health. In particular, we estimate specifications that
shorten the measured health histories from five years to either three years or one year.
Conditioning on shorter health histories should increase measurement error, since averaging
occurs over fewer years, and is likely to then increase the likelihood of reporting error based
health transitions. Consistent with this, we do see a rise in the relative probability that blue-collar
workers transitions into poorer health when using shorter occupational histories. However, there
is no corresponding indication that they are more likely to move from bad to very good health, as
the differential reporting error explanation would predict.
Our findings suggest that blue-collar workers “wear out” faster with age because they
experience more negative health shocks than their white-collar counterparts. There is no
evidence that they have greater difficulty in recovering from given shocks, nor is there a strong
indication that they regain health more quickly or completely following them. Future research
could fruitfully examine mechanisms underlying this occupational heterogeneity. An obvious
possibility is that blue-collar workers are more prone to accidents or job-related physical
traumas. Indeed, our analysis suggests that physical job demands can account for around twofifths of the difference in the transition rates of blue-collar versus white-collar workers.
Important caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting our results. Most
importantly, endogeneity could be problematic if workers with histories of blue-collar
employment have faster health declines than those in white-collar occupations for reasons that
are not occupationally related or observed. The inclusion of additional covariates and the use of
instrumental variables methods or other identification strategies in future work would be helpful
for examining the consequences of such occupational selection. Second, dichotomization of self-

19

reported health status limits our findings to a subjectively chosen threshold and implies that we
potentially lose information about movements into or out of more extreme health states. Third,
during an era when female employment rates are approaching or exceeding those males and the
occupations in which they work are becoming increasingly diverse, an extension of this research
to consider women’s occupational histories should be pursued.

Note: Specifications in rows (1)-(5) show the difference in the predicted probability of transitions into or out of bad health for men with
a 5-year history of blue-collar work versus an equal period in white-collar work. Specifications in rows (6)-(8) show the difference in
the predicted probability of transitions into or out of bad health for men with a 5-year history in the listed occupations. The coefficients
are from linear probability models estimated using 34,607 person-year observations for 5,611 men from the 1988-2005 waves of the

change in the physical demands score over five years. Robust standard errors, clustered by individual, are shown in parentheses.

Appendix A: Occupational Classifications

The PSID provided 3-digit 1970 Census group definitions for the 1984 through 2001
waves and 3-digit 2000 Census group definitions for the 2003 and later surveys. To make this
information uniform for all survey rounds, we recoded the occupation codes to 1990 Census
definitions for all years using the crosswalk provided by IPUMS-USA
(http://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/documents/occ1990_xwalk.xls). The occupations were
subsequently defined as “blue-collar,” “white-collar,” or “service” following listings provided by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Chao and Utgoff, 2003). Twenty-six occupations were not
included in the BLS list; we have categorized these occupations within the classification that is
subjectively appropriate. A list of the classifications appears in Table A-1. In addition to the
occupational classifications, we also include a fourth category for people who were not
employed at the time of the survey.
There are two notes of interest in constructing these categorical variables. First, the PSID
identifies individuals serving in the armed forces but does not indicate their occupation while in
military service. Since there were too few observations to classify military service as a separate
occupation, we dropped person-year observations for individuals serving in the armed forces
during the 5-year occupational history window. Second, a small number individuals report being
unemployed or out of the labor force but still indicate an occupation. For consistency, we coded
these individuals as not-employed.
Our main occupation variables represent average values for over the five years t-4, t-3, t2, t-1, and t. In the years up to 1997, we used information on the occupation of the primary job at
the time of the interview for all of these periods. In years after 1997, when the PSID interviewed
biennially, we used available retrospective work history information to identify the occupation of

individuals in the month one year prior to the survey month to obtain the measures for periods t3 and t-1. For instance, an individual’s 1998 occupation is defined as that reported in the month
one year prior to the 1999 interview.7 If data were missing for any years between t-4 and t (after
including the constructed values just discussed), averaging took place over the period for which
the data were available.
We merged onto the dataset information on the physical demands of occupations using
data from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT): Revised Fourth Edition (1991), which
provides a five point ordinal measure of the physical demands for 12,742 occupations. The
demands are listed as Sedentary, Light Work, Medium Work, Heavy Work, and Very Heavy
Work (see http://www.occupationalinfo.org/appendxc_1.html#STRENGTH).
We matched the physical demand characteristics of DOT occupations to the Census
occupational codes by coding the five measures to integers, one to five, increasing in physical
demands. The DOT occupations and physical demand scores were then matched to Occupational
Employment Statistics (OES) codes provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS Crosswalk
Center) and averaged over the DOT occupations within each OES occupation. Finally, physical
demands by OES occupation were weighted according to 1997 estimates of the number of
individuals employed in each of the OES occupations (BLS, 2010) and matched to the 1990
Census occupation codes for person-years in our PSID data set.

7

The retrospective information in the non-interview years (1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006) provides fewer
occupational transitions than interview years. A lower proportion of transitions during the recalled employment
history is consistent with seam effects, which have been found in the employment history of the PSID. However,
occupational measures during the non-interview years match the characteristics of those during interview years in
the terms of the number of observations and proportion of individuals in each occupational state (Callegaro, 2007).
