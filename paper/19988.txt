ABSTRACT
In this paper I explore optimal employment contract design in a random search framework, where
workers search on and off the job for employment opportunities similar to that of Lentz (2010) and
Bagger and Lentz (2013). The worker determines the frequency by which employment opportunities
arrive through a costly choice of search intensity, which is unobserved by the firm and cannot be directly
contracted upon. Firms differ in productivity by which they employ workers. Firms compete over
workers in terms of utility promises in a fashion otherwise similar to that of Postel-Vinay and Robin
(2002). As in Burdett and Coles (2003) and Burdett and Coles (2010), optimal tenure conditional contracts
are shown to be back loaded to discourage the worker from generating outside competitive pressure.
The analysis establishes existence, uniqueness and provides characterization of the core mechanism.
The paper applies the framework to the analysis of firm provided general human capital training. It
is shown that more productive firms provide more training and pay higher wages.

1 Introduction
In a frictional labor market, a firm may be quite certain that it can dictate poor
employment terms to an employee and at least in the short run still maintain the
employment relationship. However, the firm would naturally be concerned that
the worker will be unhappy and go to great lengths to find an outside employer
that will offer better terms. Such search is costly. In addition to the significant
time and psychological effort it takes for the worker to meet other firms and to
market him or herself, it is likely that the effort precludes investments in the
current relationship. Also, whatever good will and other intangible assets the
worker holds in relation to the current firm are likely to suffer in the process.
In this paper I analyze optimal employment contracts in a random search
framework, where workers search on and off the job for employment opportunities. The worker sets the offer arrival frequency through a costly choice of search
intensity, which is unobserved by the firm and cannot be directly contracted upon.
Firms differ in the marginal productivity by which they employ workers. If an
employed worker meets another firm, the two firms engage in Bertrand competition over the worker in as in Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002). It is a maintained
limited commitment assumption that the firm cannot commit to not match outside offers. Firms compete over workers in terms of lifetime utility promises.
Because a more productive firm has a greater willingness to pay for a worker, a
Bertrand competition between two firms over a worker will result in the more
productive firm winning the worker at a utility promise equal to the losing firm’s
willingness to pay.
The worker’s incentives to generate outside meetings include additional rent
extraction from the current employment relationship, which will cause search to
be inefficiently high, as viewed by the contracting parties. Search is hidden and
the worker cannot commit to a given search intensity level, which imposes an
incentive compatibility constraint on the mechanism design problem.
The employment contract is the mechanism that maximizes firm profits subject to the lifetime utility promise to the worker and subject to the constraint that
2

worker search satisfies the worker’s incentive compatibility constraint. The paper’s focus on dynamic employment contracts is closely related to Burdett and
Coles (2003), Burdett and Coles (2010), Menzio and Shi (2010), and Lamadon
(2014), and to make the problem interesting I follow their assumption of risk
averse agents and imperfect capital markets that eliminate the possibility of side
payments.
I show that the optimal employment contract will be backloaded in order to
reduce outside wage pressure on the match. The utility promise in the contract
is monotonically increasing in tenure. Wages are shown to be monotonically increasing in the utility promise. Therefore wages increase within a job through two
channels in the core model of the paper: One is the contracted upon growth rate
in wages through the utility promise path, and second the occasional arrival of an
outside job opportunity resulting in a renegotiated and higher utility promise.1
The worker’s lifetime utility increases monotonically over an employment spell,
be it within or between jobs, but as in Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) actual wages
may decrease between jobs.
In contrast to Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) but consistent with Burdett and
Coles (2010), the optimal employment contract also implies a decreasing job separation hazard in tenure because the worker’s search intensity is declining with
duration and limits to the jointly efficient level at the point where the worker is
extracting all the surplus from the match.2 In the Burdett and Coles (2010) framework the declining separation hazard is a result of the worker turning down more
outside offers as he or she moves up the wage/tenure profile, which is then associated with an increase in the incidence of inefficient job separation. It is worth
noting that in contrast with the Burdett and Coles (2010) framework, all separation in this paper is efficient. Instead search inefficiencies are related to the
1 In

section 5 I show that the framework can easily be extended to allow for human capital
growth which then provides a third channel for wage growth.
2 This prediction can be modified by the inclusion of other events in the employment relationship such as human capital growth. In section 5 I show that if the worker becomes more skilled
during an employment relationship, at that instant, the contract implies an upward jump in the
worker’s search intensity, an unchanged wage, and an upward jump in the growth rate of wages.

intensity margin.
The analysis establishes existence, uniqueness, and provides characterization
of the core employment contract mechanism. The analysis also considers design
constraints with a particular focus on rent division. The Postel-Vinay and Robin
(2002) framework has the feature that employers extract all rents associated with
a match in excess of the total surplus of a worker’s current match. Hence, if
the worker is either unemployed or extracting full surplus in a given match, the
worker will receive none of the additional rents associated with meeting a more
productive employer. It is an interesting feature of the unrestricted contract design that the worker’s inability to commit to a search intensity does not result in
any additional rent extraction in the worker’s favor. But once the hidden search is
coupled with design constraints, additional rents do flow to the worker. The contracting framework in this paper allows ex ante rent extraction due to constraints
on the contract or the shape of the utility function. The presence of a minimum
wage is one example which is also studied in Flinn and Mabli (2009). A utility
function that has the feature that limw→w u′ (w) = −∞ will also effectively impose a minimum wage w on the problem. Finally, the arbitrary constraint of for
example a flat wage profile can also by itself result in ex ante rent extraction. In all
these cases, it is possible that employers will voluntarily give the worker a strictly
higher lifetime utility than what is required by the worker’s outside option. Consequently, there will be strictly positive rents to unemployed search and to search
where the worker is extracting full surplus from her current match. The paper
allows both non-essential worker search and ex ante rent extraction as ways to
understand the unemployed worker’s exit from unemployment.
The paper applies the framework to the study of firm provided general human
capital training. As is well known, outside competition for the worker generates
a hold up problem where the worker extracts the rents from the investment paid
for by the firm. In a perfectly competitive setting, the typical solution to this
problem is for the worker to pay for the training up front through lower initial
wages. In the current setting, frictions soften the competition and the firm can

4

reasonably expect some returns to its investment depending on the strength of
the outside competition. The firm can manipulate the outside competition pressure through the worker’s search intensity incentive compatibility constraint. In
addition, the firm has the option to backload wages to at least in part make the
worker pay for the training up front. Hence, it is a setup that is very well suited
for the study of training. As in Fu (2011), the analysis finds a broadly positive
relationship between firm productivity type and the amount of training provided
to the worker. However, this conclusion is somewhat modified by the insight that
it is possible that a worker in a high productivity firm may search very intensely
given a low current utility promise. In this case, the returns to search through rent
extraction from the current employment relationship are high, and so the worker
searches intensely. In this situation, the firm chooses to provide little training
initially. Through the backloading, the workers utility promise will increase, the
search intensity will drop, and training will increase. The key insight here is that
it is generally true that high productivity firms do tend to provide more training,
however, only once the employment relationship has solidified. The paper provides numerical simulation of the steady state equilibrium of the training model.
The paper contributes to (at least) two existing research efforts in the literature. One is the study of optimal wage contracts in models with labor market
frictions such as Burdett and Coles (2003) and Burdett and Coles (2010). Obviously the study of wage determination in models with friction is a much larger
literature related to the Nobel prize winning research by Peter Diamond, Dale
T. Mortensen, and Chris Pissarides. However, this work is typically strong on
predictions on the division of rents from match creation rather than the particular path of payments during the match, which is often pinned down with the
ultimately arbitrary assumption of flat wage profiles.
The paper is also related to the empirical study of wage dynamics with contributions such as Altonji and Shakotko (1987); Topel (1991); Yamaguchi (2010);
Bagger et al. (2013); Kambourov and Manovskii (2009). Yamaguchi (2010) and
Bagger et al. (2013) study settings where wages respond to two key accumulation

5

processes: human capital and search capital. The example in Section 5 in the
paper include the same two accumulation processes, but in contrast to these two
papers, the current framework does not impose a flat piece rate wage contract,
but allows the contract to be set optimally by the firm and includes the moral
hazard problem in search intensity that implies a separate source of backloading.
In addition, in the training example in Section 5, the firm is manipulating both
the accumulation processes by the design of the contract.
Of course, the issue of backloading and/or frontloading of contracts also has
a long history in the principal-agent moral hazard literature as in for example
Rogerson (1985) and Fudenberg et al. (1990). Just as Burdett and Mortensen (1998)
and Burdett and Coles (2003) can be viewed as an efficiency wage model, the
current analysis has parallels to this literature as well in that the design of the
compensation scheme directly impacts the joint value of the match. In this case,
the impact is through labor turnover related costs and gains as opposed to the
productivity realization of the worker.
The paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2 is analyze the core employment
contract design problem with hidden search.

Here I establish existence and

uniqueness of the contract and provide characterization. The main part of the
analysis is set in discrete time and the continuous time formulation is obtained as
the limit when period length is taken to zero. In Section 3 I consider constraints
on the design program, in particular minimum wages. In Section 4 I briefly touch
on socially efficient search, and in Section 5 I provide an application of the framework to the question general human capital training provided by firms.

2 The Basic Mechanism
In this section I present the core wage mechanism along with characterization,
existence and uniqueness proofs. For expositional simplicity, the arguments are
presented in discrete time. In the following sections I use these results to expand
the analysis to a steady state equilibrium and also consider worker heterogeneity,

6

human capital growth, savings, and design constraints. This part of the analysis
is done taking the continuous limit of the discrete time environment which allows
for simpler expressions in the now more complicated setting.

2.1 Environment
Time is discrete. Each period has length ∆. Workers and firms are infinitely lived
and all discount time according to discount factor β ( ∆) = e−r∆ . All workers are
identical. Firms differ in their match output levels, which are normalized to lie
in the unit interval, p ∈ [0, 1]. Workers can be either employed or unemployed.
Workers consumer their income, w∆, in a given period, the utility of which is
given by increasing and concave function, u (w) ∆. An unemployed worker has
zero income.
Matches are created through a frictional search process. Specifically, through
a costly search choice λ the worker sets the probability, s (∆) = 1 − e−λ∆ , that she
will meet a vacancy during the period in question. Regardless of employment
state, the cost of the choice of λ is given by increasing and convex cost function
c (λ) ∆. A vacancy is characterized by its output level which is drawn from the
cumulative offer distribution, Φ ( p), which has density φ ( p) . A match ends either
through an exogenous destruction probability, d (∆) = 1 − e−δ∆ , or if the worker
quits to another firm as a result of meeting a more attractive vacancy. To save
on notation in the discrete formulation of the problem, I will set up the problem
where the worker is directly choosing the offer arrival probability, s ∈ [0, 1] at per


− ln(1− s)
.
unit of time cost ĉ (s) = ∆c
∆
A firm’s match output level is assumed to be time independent. The same is

true for the search cost function. Generally, it will be assumed that there are no
aggregate shocks and that the economy is in steady state. I make the following
assumptions on the model fundamentals.
Assumption 1. u (·) : R → R is strictly increasing, strictly concave and at least twice
differentiable.

7

Assumption 2. The first derivatives of the utility function are bounded, such that for
any w ∈ R, u′ (w) ∈ [u′ , u′ ] .
Assumption 3. The offer distribution has no mass points and everywhere positive mass,

∀ p ∈ [0, 1], 0 < φ ( p) < ∞.
Assumption 4. c (λ) : R + → R is strictly increasing, strictly convex and at least twice
differentiable. Furthermore, c (0) = c′ (0) = 0.
Firms are constant returns to scale and make decisions at the match level
to maximize the expected profits at that match. Each firm posts vacancies and
competes over workers as in Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002). If a firm’s vacancy
meets a currently employed worker, the two firms will engage in Bertrand competition over the worker. The worker will choose employment with the firm that
offers the worker the higher expected lifetime utility going forward. Hence, the
competition between the firms takes place in terms of lifetime utility promises.
Define V̄ ( p) as the most lifetime utility a productivity p firm is willing to offer a worker through an optimally designed employment contract subject to the
constraints of the contracting environment. A utility promise beyond V̄ ( p) will
result in negative expected profits to the firm. It will be shown below that V̄ ( p) is
monotonically increasing p. Consequently, a competition between two firms with
productivities p and p′ , respectively, such that p < p′ will result in the worker accepting employment with the productivity p′ firm with an employment contract
that promises the worker lifetime utility no less than V̄ ( p). If a vacancy meets an
unemployed worker, the firm will hire the worker with an employment contract
that offers at a minimum the utility value of unemployment, U.

2.2 Employment Contract Design Constraints
The contractual environment is one of limited commitment: The worker can at
any point costlessly quit to unemployment, meaning that the contract must at any
point promise the worker no less than the value of unemployment at that point.

8

The firm cannot commit to not match outside offers.3 Firms can also at any point
costlessly lay off a worker, which implies that the contract cannot at any point
have negative expected profit value going forward. As will be shown below, in
the simple version of the model, the firm’s participation constraint turns out to
not be binding. All in all this means that the utility promise of an employment
contract with a productivity p firm must at any point be in the interval [U, V̄ ( p)] .
The worker’s search intensity choice is not observable by the firm and the
worker cannot commit to any particular search choice. As a result, the specified
search intensity in the contract must satisfy incentive compatibility. In line with
the no borrowing or saving assumption in the simple model, the setup assumes
no side payments.
Part of search being unobservable also means that a worker’s meetings with
outside firms are only observable to her employer if she decides to reveal a meeting. A worker will reveal a meeting in order to induce contract renegotiation,
which only happens if both parties agree to do so. The revelation of a meeting
with an outside firm that can offer more than the value of the worker’s current
contract induces renegotiation. As part of the no side payments assumption and
in line with the assumption that the firm cannot commit to not match outside
offers, the contract cannot make payments conditional on renegotiation or the
worker separating from the firm. The renegotiation itself is governed by the nature of the Bertrand competition and is not affected by the history of the contract.
The history of a contract is in the simple model just the path of past utility
promises, σ (t) = {Vτ } tτ =0 . Whatever contracts came before the current contract
is irrelevant. A contract specifies a history dependent path of utility promises,
search intensity, and wages which given the simplicity of the history can be writ

and Robin (2004) explore the firm’s option to commit to not match outside offers.

2.3 Worker Lifetime Utility
For now, set ∆ = 1 and in the notation suppress the dependence of the arrival
rates on the length of a period. Denote by Vt the worker’s valuation of her expected discounted stream of future utilities given a current employment contract
with history s (t). In the valuation of possible outside employment opportunity offers, it useful to characterize a vacancy by its willingness to pay, V̄ ( p),
rather than the productivity. Define by F (V ) the distribution of willingness to
pay across vacancies, F (V ) = Φ ( p (V )) , where p (V ) = V̄ −1 (V ). Furthermore,
define F̂ (V ) = 1 − F (V ). With this and suppressing explicit dependence on the
contract history in the notation, the worker’s valuation of her current contract
with an employer with willingness to pay V̄ can be written as,
Vt = u ( wt ) − ĉ (st ) + βdU

.

(1)

In period t, the worker receives utility u (wt ) from wage income and takes disutility ĉ (st ) from the search effort. If the worker is laid off, she receives continuation
utility U, which is simply the value of being unemployed. By the assumption of
steady state, the value of unemployment is time independent. If her job survives,
and she does not receive an outside offer, her continuation value in the employment contract is Vt+1. In the case where she does receive an offer, denote the
outside employer’s willingness to pay by V̄ ′ . In the case where V̄ ′ ≤ Vt+1, nothing comes of the meeting. If Vt+1 < V̄ ′ ≤ V̄ the worker will force a renegotiation
of her contract by engaging the two firms in Bertrand competition over her. Her
current employer’s willingness to pay, V̄, exceeds that of the outside suitor, so
she will stay, but will be given a new employment contract with an initial lifetime
utility promise of V̄ ′ . Finally, if V̄ ′ > V̄ the worker will leave her current employer

10

and receive an employment contract with the outside firm with an initial utility
promise of her old employer’s willingness to pay, V̄. The second line follows by
integration by parts.
The implicit assumption in the above expression is that an employer will not
voluntarily offer more lifetime utility than what is dictated by the Bertrand competition between employers. In section 3, I discuss contract design constraints that
can result in a violation of this assumption, in which case equation (1) is modified to reflect that job-to-job transitions can be associated with a new employment
contract that has value in excess of the willingness to pay of the old employer.
An unemployed worker receives income flow normalized at zero. Given the
case where employers give no more lifetime utility than strictly required by the
competition between employers, there are no rents to unemployed search. Any
meeting will result in an employer giving the unemployed worker a take it or
leave it offer matching the value of unemployment and nothing more.4 Consequently, the value of unemployment in this case is very simply equivalent to the
infinitely discounted stream of utility of unemployed income,
U=

u ( 0)
.
1−β

(2)

Once we move to design constraints in section 3 that result in ex ante rent extraction, equation (2) will be appropriately modified to include the now positive
option value to unemployed search.
4 The

discrete setting naturally allows modifications of this argument, say, as in Burdett and
Judd (1983) where the worker meets multiple employers in a given period and they have to compete with each other Bertrand style over the worker. It is a rather elegant way of introducing ex
ante rent extraction into the setup, and the probability of meeting multiple employers in a single
period is handled naturally as multiple arrivals of the Poisson arrival process. However, since the
paper will be emphasizing the continuous limit of the setting and this competitive mechanism
does not survive in the limit, I have chosen to ignore the possibility of multiple meetings in a
single period.

2.5 Optimal Contract Design
Competition between employers takes place in terms of lifetime utility promises.
For a given utility promise, the firm will design an employment contract that
maximizes the future discounted profit stream of the match subject to the design constraints and the lifetime utility promise. Stated in terms of the history of
the contract, this is a large state space problem. However, following Spear and
Srivastava (1987); Atkeson and Lucas (1992); Menzio and Shi (2010) the firm’s employment contract design problem can be represented by a recursive formulation
of the firm’s valuation of a match as a function of the lifetime utility promise to
the worker at that point.
For a given optimal employment contract, C, and given the firm’s willingness to pay, V̄ ( p) , the firm’s valuation of the associated future discounted profit

(5)

where steady state has already been invoked to eliminate time dependency of
Π (V ). The per period profit is p − wt and if the match survives, the firm’s continuation value associated with promising the worker a lifetime utility in the next
period of Vt+1 is given by Π (Vt+1 ). The firm will deliver Vt+1 to the worker in the
case where the worker does not obtain an outside offer or if the worker meets an
outside firm with willingness to pay less than Vt+1 . If the worker meets an outside firm with willingness to pay, V̄ ′ ∈ [Vt+1 , V̄ ], the match will survive, but the
employment contract will be renegotiated to deliver V̄ ′ to the worker, which has
value Π (V̄ ′ ) to the firm. If the outside employer has willingness to pay V̄ ′ > V̄,
the match ends. The firm’s outside value of a match is zero. The second line
follows from integration by parts and that by definition, Π (V̄ ) = 0.
I impose incentive compatibility on the employment contract design problem
through the first order approach and require that any choice of st must satisfy
equation (3). Given a lifetime utility promise of V ∈ [U, V̄ ] and suppressing the
functional dependence on V̄ to save on notation, the firm’s valuation of an optimal
employment contract is given by,

where the functional dependence on V̄ is again suppressed. Equation (7) is the
promise keeping constraint stating the contract must deliver no less than the
promise of V. Part of establishing consistency of the setup requires showing
that this constraint is always binding. Equation (8) is the incentive compatibility
constraint. Equation (9) represents the worker and firm participation constraints.

By Blackwell’s sufficient conditions, this is a contraction. The profit function is
bounded above by the level,
Π̄ =

.
1 − β (1 − d)

s = 0 maximizes joint surplus between the worker and the firm in this simple
version of the problem without ex ante rent extraction. In addition, a worker
hired out of unemployment is the smallest utility promise the firm can ever face,
V = U, and simply just giving the worker a flat wage w = 0 until the match ends
is the cost minimizing way to meet the utility promise of V = U. This will give
the firm an expected profit of Π̄. The constraints in Γ (V |V̄ ) for any V ≥ U are
more restrictive and result in lower profits than Π̄. Profits are bounded below by,
Π=

p − u−1 (V̄ [1 − β (1 − d)] − βdU )
,
1 − β (1 − d)

which is the profit level for a perpetually flat wage contract with no search at the
utility promise V = V̄. This is the most restrictive utility promise and a feasible
contract choice which may or may not be dominated by the optimal design choice.

are satisfied. Therefore by the contraction mapping theorem, there exists a unique
fixed point to the mapping in equation (10), which is then the unique solution to

Sufficient conditions for existence of w̃ (V ) can be something like limw→−∞ u (w) =

else in the proofs. By construction, the wage w̃ (V ) in combination with search

spectively. By Assumption 2, the promise keeping constraint is always binding, that is,
ν (V ) > 0 for all V ∈ [U, V̄ ] . In addition, the incentive compatibility constraint is binding for any Y (V ) < V̄ but is not binding for Y (V ) = V̄, that is µ (Y (V )) ≥ 0 with
strict inequality for Y (V ) < V̄ and equality for Y (V ) = V̄.
Proof. Equations (11)-(14) are the first order conditions of the Lagrangian associated with the problem in (6) with respect to w, s, and Y, respectively. By assumption 2, the promise keeping constraint is always strictly binding, ν (V ) > 0, since
the first derivatives of the utility function are bounded. The incentive compatibility constraint (12) implies that s (Y (V )) > 0 for all Y (V ) ∈ [U, V¯) and by equation
(13) and Assumption 4 it follows that µ (Y (V )) > 0 for all Y (V ) ∈ [U, V̄ ). For
Y (V ) = V̄, and since by construction Π (V̄ ) = 0 it follows that s does not enter
into the profit function. At zero profits, the firm is indifferent whether the match
ends soon or later due to worker search. Hence, the firm will want to use the
worker’s search intensity only to create slack in the promise keeping constraint,
which is perfectly aligned with the worker’s incentive compatibility constraint of
maximizing lifetime utility. Hence, the incentive compatibility constraint (8) is
not a binding constraint in this case, µ (V̄ ) = 0.
Proposition 1 establishes that Π (V ) must be strictly decreasing and strictly
concave in V over the support, V ∈ [U, V̄ ]. In order to establish concavity, the
proof makes the sufficient condition that the second derivative of the cost function
be decreasing in the search intensity choice, as summarized in assumption 5:
Assumption 5. For any s1 > s0 ≥ 0, the search cost function is such that ĉ′′ (s1 ) ≤
ĉ′′ (s0 ).
The assumption is sufficient (but not necessary) to ensure that Ψ (·) is decreasing which is by itself stronger than necessary to establish concavity. Assumption
5 is somewhat heavy handed, but it has the advantage of being simple and it
provides a sufficient condition for the nice characteristic that µ (V ) will be everywhere decreasing in V, that is, the incentive compatibility constraint will be less

binding the higher the utility promise.5 With concavity established, Proposition
1 provides the key result that there exists a unique optimal employment contract,
that it backloads wages and that lifetime utility is increasing in tenure as it goes
toward the firm’s willingness to pay.
Proposition 1. Given assumptions 1-5, there exists for any productivity p ∈ [0, 1] firm
a unique profit function Π (V |V̄ ( p)) as defined in equation (6) where V̄ ( p) is the firm’s
willingness to pay. The profit function is differentiable, strictly decreasing and strictly
concave over the support V ∈ [U, V̄ ( p)], with Π (V̄ ( p) |V̄ ( p)) = 0. The willingness

 

to pay is given by, V̄ ( p) = u ( p) + βdU / 1 − β (1 − d) . Wages are backloaded,
w (V ) ≤ w (Y (V )) , with strict inequality for V < V̄ ( p) .

Proof. The proof uses the corollary to the contraction mapping theorem that if a
contraction mapping T : X → X maps functions in the subset S ⊆ X into a subset
S′ ⊂ S, then the unique fixed point v = Tv must belong to S′ , that is v ∈ S′ . In
this case S will be the set of weakly decreasing and weakly concave functions and
S′ will the be set of strictly decreasing and strictly concave functions and X is the
set of continuous and bounded functions.
For a given willingness to pay V̄, the profit function Π (V ) is the unique fixed
point to the contraction mapping in equation (10). Take some decreasing and
concave function Π (V ) over the support V ∈ [U, V̄ ]. Furthermore, assume Π (V )
is differentiable. In this case, the solution to the maximization problem on the
right hand side of equation (10) is characterized by equations (11)-(15) in Lemma
2. It is straightforward to show that the second order sufficient conditions for a
concave problem are also satisfied in this case, so the first order equations define
a unique maximizer. In addition, by the envelope theorem, it immediately follows
that,

∂T (Π) (V )
= − ν (V ) ,

third order derivative condition also figures prominently in Rogerson (1985) and also in
relation to establishing concavity/convexity. However, the contexts and mechanisms are quite
different and seem to shed little light on each other. In addition, simulations suggest that Assumption 5 is far from necessary in establishing concavity. Examples are available upon request.

where the strict inequality follows from Assumption 2. Hence, T (Π) (V ) is
strictly decreasing in V. In addition it must be that T (Π) (V ) is strictly concave, that is ∂T (Π) (V ) /∂V is strictly decreasing in V. Assume to the contrary that there exist some U ≤ V0 < V1 ≤ V̄ such that ∂T (Π) (V0 ) /∂V0 ≤
∂T (Π) (V1 ) /∂V1 . By equation (16) this implies w (V0 ) ≥ w (V1 ) . Since the promise
keeping constraint is always binding the continuation utility promises must satisfy,

=

∂T (Π) (V1 )
,
∂V1

where the first inequality follows from concavity of Π (V ). The second inequality

20

comes from Assumptions 3 and 5. Assumption 3 ensures that there is positive
mass over all of the offer distribution support and so as the continuation utility promise strictly increases, the probability that the worker receives a better
offer strictly declines. Consequently, the worker will search strictly less. Assumption 5 is sufficient to guarantee that a strict increase in the continuation
utility promise is associated with a strictly less binding incentive compatibility constraint in the sense that µ (Y (V )) is strictly declining in Y (V ). In total
this implies that Ψ (Y (V )) is strictly declining in Y (V ). Hence, one obtains that
∂T (Π) (V0 ) /∂V0 > ∂T (Π) (V1 ) /∂V1 which is a contradiction. Hence, it must be
T (Π) (V ) is strictly concave over the support V ∈ [U, V̄ ] .
By the Benveniste and Scheinkman argument in the proof of Lemma 1, as long
as T (Π) (V ) is concave it is also differentiable. By the corollary to the contraction mapping theorem, since T (Π) maps decreasing and concave functions into
strictly decreasing and strictly concave functions, the fixed point must be strictly
decreasing and strictly concave because the set of weakly increasing and weakly
concave functions is a closed subset of the set of bounded and continuous functions. By the fact that concavity is mapped into concavity always, it follows that
differentiability is also maintained in the iteration of the mapping as it converges
to the fixed point. Therefore it must be that the profit function Π (V ) defined in (6)
must be strictly decreasing, strictly concave, and differentiable over the support
V ∈ [U, V̄ ] .
By construction Π (V̄ ) = 0. Furthermore, by equation (14) the continuation
utility promise at the willingness to pay satisfies that Π′ (V̄ ) = Π′ (Y (V̄ )) ⇒
Y (V̄ ) = V̄. By the incentive compatibility constraint, λ (V̄ ) = 0, which gives,
0 = Π (V̄ ) = p − w (V̄ ) + Π (V̄ )

⇓
w (V̄ ) = p.

21

Hence, from the always binding promise keeping constraint, it follows that,
V̄ ( p) = u ( p) + β (1 − d) V̄ + βdU

m
V̄ ( p) =

u ( p) + βdU
.
1 − β (1 − d)

Therefore, the willingness to pay is strictly increasing in p. Hence, define V̂ =
V̄ (1), and in combination with Assumption 3 the conditions in Lemma 1 for
existence and uniqueness are satisfied.
For the fixed point Π (V ) = T (Π) (V ) it must be that,
Π′ (V ) − Π′ (Y (V )) = Ψ (Y (V )) ≥ 0,
which by Π strictly decreasing and strictly concave implies that V̄ ≥ Y (V ) ≥ V
for all V ∈ [U, V̄ ] with strict inequalities for V < V̄ and equality for V = V̄.
Furthermore, again by concavity, wages are strictly increasing in the lifetime
utility promise, which delivers that w (V ) < w (Y (V )) for any V < V̄ and
w (V̄ ) = w (Y (V̄ )) = p. That is, wages are strictly increasing for utility promises
below the willingness to pay. The optimal contract promises increasing lifetime
utility to the point of delivering exactly the firm’s willingness to pay after which
it is flat. The contract asymptotes to the willingness to pay in that V̄ > Y (V ) > V
for any V < V̄ by the strict concavity of the profit function and by the fact that
Ψ (V̄ ) = 0.
By Proposition 1 it follows that w (V ) is increasing in the utility promise. For
lifetime utility promises strictly less than the firm’s willingness to pay At the
willingness to pay the worker is extracting full surplus which is delivered in a flat
wage profile, w (V̄ ( p)) = p with Y (V̄ ( p)) = V̄ ( p) and s (V̄ ( p)) = 0.

2.7 Savings
The framework assumes no savings and borrowing, which simplifies the analysis
considerably. Since an obvious solution to the moral hazard problem in the paper
is for the worker to buy the match up front (which is ruled out by the assumption of no side payments), it is not surprising that the firm would adopt a more
aggressive backloading strategy if the worker can smooth consumption by use of
already accumulated savings. In the extreme, if the worker has enough savings,
the optimal backloading strategy would resemble an up front payment for the
job and then quickly settle into a flat wage scheme equalling the output of the
match. This would resolve the inefficiency that results from the worker searching
to extract rents from the current relationship. However, this presumes a situation
where the worker has made past consumption sacrifices to accumulate savings.
And if indeed the worker were to receive rents from eliminating or reducing the
inefficiencies in future relationships, the worker would be motivated to make con-

24

sumption sacrifices to accumulate savings. However, in the baseline version of the
model the rents go to the firm, and as such, the worker has no incentive to accumulate savings for the purpose of eliminating inefficiencies due to hidden search.
Therefore the worker has no incentives to accumulate savings for the purpose of
eliminating search inefficiencies. Of course, one can imagine introducing other
incentives to save, such as life cycle savings, and one can possibly obtain a quantitative impact on the baseline analysis this way. But this is beyond the scope of
this paper.
In the next section, the analysis will consider wage mechanism deign constraints such as minimum wages that will result in ex ante rent extraction by the
worker. A bargaining setup as in Cahuc et al. (2006) also has the feature that
the worker can extract rents from a future match over and above the total match
surplus in the current match. In those setups, the worker will receive some fraction of the increased rents due to accumulated savings. However, only in the case
where the worker receives all the rents from a future match will savings not be
under-accumulated.

3 Design Constraints
It is noteworthy that in the core problem, the worker’s lack of ability to commit ex
ante to a search intensity level does not by itself result in any rent extraction by the
worker. Any rents that flow to the worker are purely a result of the offer matching
process. For example, an unemployed worker has in the core problem no gains
from search as a future employer will offer a contract that exactly matches the
value of unemployment, and no more. The same is true for any worker who
is currently extracting full rents from a given employment relationship. This
changes with the imposition of constraints on the choice of wage path in the
contract. In the following, I consider two constraints: (1) A minimum wage, that
is the wage must at any point in time t be greater than some level, wt ≥ w, and
(2) a constraint on the change in wages, specifically impose that the wage profile

25

must be flat, V̇t = 0.
The design constraints that are considered in this section all have the implication that the promise keeping constraint is no longer necessarily binding for
all utility promises, that is, it is possible that ν (V ) = 0 for some V ∈ [U, V̄ ] .
This modifies the worker’s valuation of search since the worker may receive more
lifetime utility from an employer than what is dictated by the Bertrand competition between firms. For this purpose, define the object V ( p) as the least lifetime utility an employer will want to give a worker irrespective of the worker’s
outside option. Since the worker always has unemployment as the outside option, if that option is binding, set V ( p) equal to the value of unemployment,
V ( p) = max (V ( p) , U ). For expositional purposes, also define the minimum
utility promise in terms of a firm’s willingness to pay rather than its productivity,

Ṽ (V̄ ) = V V̄ −1 (V̄ ) . With this object, the worker’s expected lifetime utility in
equation (1) is modified as follows,

The modified incentive compatibility constraint highlights that the worker’s
access to hidden search may lead to ex ante rent extraction given particular constraints on the wage contract. Thus, even though firms make take-it-or-leave-it

26

offers to unemployed workers, there may still be strictly positive returns to unemployed search. And by the same token, the jointly efficient search within a
given match may not be zero, since the worker may be able to extract rents from
an outside firm in excess of the maximal rents of the current relationship. This is
in contrast to the standard Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) setup, where all rents
to match creation fall to the firms.
Flinn and Mabli (2009) also argue the issue of ex ante rent extraction associated
with minimum wages in a Cahuc et al. (2006) setup with assumed flat wage
profiles and exogenous offer arrival rates. Common to their analysis and to the
one in this paper is the firm expectation that its workers will on occasion meet
outside employers and the subsequent contract renegotiation will result in either
wage increases or separation. In the Cahuc et al. (2006) paper, the flat wage
contract is then set so as to match whatever match surplus division is dictated by
the Bertrand competition and wage bargaining at the outset of the match. InFlinn
and Mabli (2009) this wage may be below the minimum wage in which case wages
are set as a corner solution at the minimum wage and the worker ends up with
a greater match surplus share than that dictated by the competitive pressures in
combination with the standard bargaining.
This has similarities to what happens in the analysis at hand. However, the
incentive compatibility constraint interacts with lower wage bound in a different
way. The worker’s implicit threat to search incents the firm to promise a greater
utility level from the next period. It is an interesting aspect of the analysis that the
inability to commit to a search intensity level does not give the worker any match
rents in the baseline case in the model. But this is because the firm can simply
drop the current wage freely with no adverse effects on behavior. The minimum
wage limits this mechanism and sets the stage for the result that the worker’s
inability to commit to a particular search intensity effectively delivers rents to the
worker.

27

3.1 Minimum wages
A minimum wage can be imposed on the problem in the form of wt ≥ w or it
can be a consequence of a utility function specification that violates assumption
A2. A utility function that has the characteristic that limw→w+ u′ (w) = −∞ will
have a similar impact on the optimal contracting problem as the simple minimum
wage constraint as above. So, to keep things simple, I will maintain assumption
A2 and let minimum wage constraints be expressed in the form of wt ≥ w. In this
case, the firm’s optimal contract design problem is still given as in equation (6),
but the constraint set is modified by,

which means that the continuation utility will put the problem into a strictly decreasing part of the profit function. It also follows that η (V ) = 1 and then, necessarily, w (V ) = w. The search intensity is directly determined by the continuation

Minimum wages are part of the institutional makeup of many labor markets
and if nothing else one would typically want to impose non-negativity of wages
on the analysis. The framework will have the implication that across a range of
different types of firms wage contracts can turn out to start at the minimum wage.
While the worker will spend only one period at the minimum wage the dynamics
away from it may be slow enough to generate a resemblance of a mass point at
the minimum wage, consistent with data.

3.2 Flat wage contracts
Given the focus in the existing literature on flat wage contracts, one can consider
the impact of constraining wages to be flat until renegotiated. In this case, the design problem is as in Section 3.1 except that the continuation utility is eliminated
from the set of control variables and the constraint set is written as,

In this case, the promise keeping constraint (34) may not be binding, as the firm
trades off giving the worker more utility in return for a lower search intensity
and greater overall joint match surplus. Again, the design constraint allows the
worker to benefit from the inability to commit to a search intensity.

4 Socially Efficient Search
The Mortensen rule, Mortensen (1982), of efficient search dictates that the initiator
or “match maker” of a match also receive all the surplus from it. In the partial setting that I have worked with so far, workers are fully responsible for the creation
of matches, yet in the no ex ante rent extraction version of the model all the rents
associated with unemployed search go to the firms.6 Clearly, workers in this state
6 This

is also true for the search by workers who are extracting all the rents from their current
relationships.

30

must search too little from a social point of view. It is actually quite bad: If the
model does not provide the unemployed worker with a costless strictly positive
base level of offer arrivals, unemployment becomes a trap and the steady state
economy collapses to zero employment. On the other hand, consider a worker
currently employed with the most productive firm. Any search by this worker
is socially inefficient since it cannot result in the creation of a more productive
match. Yet, as long as the worker is receiving less than all of the rents from the
match, he or she will engage in a strictly positive level of search, which is socially
too much. Thus, it should be clear that the economy will not be socially efficient.
This section will document the extent and the sources of the inefficiency.
The direct application of the Mortensen rule is to give the worker the entire
production flow from a match. Otherwise, constrain the social planner to not
be able to smooth consumption across individuals and states. For simplicity,
consider the continuous time version of the model. Let the social welfare criterion
for a given state of the economy, G ( p), be given by,

is the discounted stream of future utilities and λ (t) is the choice of state conditional search intensities. The functional equation for this expression is,

λ∗ ( p) is the constrained socially optimal level of search. Obviously, it is not
tenure dependent. It is monotonically decreasing in the type of the firm.
If on the other hand, firms spend resources as part of the match creation process, then the Mortensen rule dictates that for search to be efficient, firms must
receive some of the ex post rents from matches. As in the case of the Hosios
rule, the setting calls for a specific balance in rent extraction. One can imagine
labor market policies and institutions, such as for example the minimum wage as
playing a possibly important role in this case.

5 Extension
So far the analysis has focused on the core mechanism and has left out what is
possibly empirically important dynamics and heterogeneity. In what follows I
present an application of the framework to human capital dynamics, specifically
that of firm provided general human capital training. The application presents
an understanding of how frictions allow for training to be provided by softening
the classic hold up problem, where the worker can appropriate the rents from
the training through competition from other firms for his services. It does so in
a framework that allows the firm to make the worker “pay” for training up front
through lower initial wages, but the instrument is limited by the worker’s risk
aversion. In addition, the firm can design wages so as to control the extent of
the competitive pressure on the match by manipulating the worker’s incentives
to search for outside offers.

32

The model predicts that more productive firms are in a better position to provide training since the competitive pressure on them is smaller. This generates
a positive correlation between accumulated search capital and the growth rate of
human capital. This is an important point for the analysis of the impact of frictions and heterogeneity on wage dispersion, since human capital heterogeneity
now becomes tied to firm productivity heterogeneity and frictions in terms of heterogeneity in the accumulation of search capital. The backloading of the contract
due to the hidden search also introduces a dynamic that training is increasing in
the worker’s tenure with the firm, which is a natural because the relationship is
becoming cemented and the outside competitive pressure is diminishing.

5.1 Training
Frictions soften competition over workers and may allow firms to reap the rewards from training its workers with general skills. Otherwise, the classic answer
to the question of how general training is provided is for workers to pay for it up
front through reduced wages. The framework in this paper is particularly well
suited to study the provision of general human capital: Exposure to outside competition is in part dictated by the firm’s position in the productive hierarchy, but
it is also a result of search behavior which can be be affected through the design
of the wage mechanism. Furthermore, the contract design allows for wage profile
flexibility in tenure and considers risk averse workers.
More productive firms face less outside competitive pressure and will as a
result provide more training. This is a key result in Fu (2011) where the question
is studied in a Burdett and Mortensen (1998) wage posting model.7 The result is
also related to shin Hwang et al. (1998) where firms produce not only an output
good but also an amenity that can only be consumed by the employed worker.
7 Including

productive heterogeneity on the worker side in the Burdett and Mortensen (1998)
setup is generally difficult, but if one restricts attention to piecewise contracts in human capital efficiency units and otherwise design the model so that it is generally multiplicative in the
worker’s efficiency units of human capital, then the firms wage posting problem becomes one of
establishing a human capital efficiency unit compensation rate. This is the approach in Fu (2011).

33

The correlation between wages and intensity of amenity provision depends on the
assumed correlation between output efficiency and amenity production efficiency.
In this particular case, the ability to take returns from provision of training is
negatively correlated with the degree of outside competitive pressure, and so
more training is associated with more productive firms.
The insight that more productive firms will provide more training does carry
through in the analysis in this section, however with modifications. How much
training is provided depends on the worker’s search intensity. A highly productive firm that gives little utility to its worker must expect that she is searching
intensely for outside offers and therefore face greater competitive pressure. The
analysis in this paper will find that training is increasing in the duration of the
employment relationship. Wages and utility promises are backloaded in the contract and so a worker’s search intensity is decreasing in the duration. As the
relationship solidifies, the training intensity increases. More productive firms do
tend to provide more training, however this conclusion is in part a result of longer
employment spell durations.
5.1.1 The model
Turning to the specifics of the model, I take the continuous time framework setup
above and add human capital dynamics. For expositional purposes I assume that
all workers are initially identical, but it is straightforward to allow for ex ante
productive worker heterogeneity as well. All workers are born inexperienced
into unemployment and become experienced at some Poisson rate γ if employed,
which I will also refer to as the training intensity. The training intensity γ is provided by the firm at increasing and convex training cost χ (γ).8 An inexperienced
worker has productivity p0 ( p) whereas an experienced worker’s productivity is
p1 ( p), where p0 ( p) < p1 ( p), for all p ∈ [0, 1]. At any instant there is a flow
of newborns into the unemployment pool. Any worker dies at Poisson rate m.
8 For

simplicity I assume that all firms have access to the same training technology, but this
could be relaxed.

34

Normalize the total labor force at unity. In this case, the flow of newborns into
the unemployment pool equals m. Define the effective discount rate, ρ = r + m.
The wage contract design problem of an experienced worker is no different
from that analyzed in section 2.6 since there is no more potential for human
capital growth in this case. In the following, I present the contract design problem
of a productivity p firm. To keep notation in the following simple, I suppress the
dependence of all the values on the type of the firm since it is constant in all the
expressions. Thus, the profit value function Πi (V ) is the profit of an optimally
designed contract to the productivity p firm given a utility promise of V to an
experience level i ∈ {0, 1} worker.
Firm p’s contract design problem for an inexperienced worker is given by,

where η0 (V ) is the Lagrange multiplier on the worker’s participation constraint.
Specifically, η0 (V ) > 0 ⇒ X (V ) = U1 . Equations (20 (41), and (42) imply that as
long as the worker’s participation constraint is not binding, then wages will be
smooth across a jump in the worker’s human capital, that is w1 (X (V )) = w0 (V ) .
As long as the worker is just the tiniest bit risk averse, the contract will have this
feature. Of course, the growth rate in utility promise and wages may well jump
across the skill level increase, but wages will be smooth. It is worth noting this
feature because it is distinctly different from the oft used assumption of piecewise
contracts in human capital.
Equation (43) states that training is chosen so that the marginal costs of training equals the gains. The gains consist of the direct increase in profit value
to the firm as the worker becomes experienced, Π1 ( X (V )) − Π0 (V ) as well
as the profit value to the firm from loosening the utility promise constraint,

−Π0′ (V ) (X (V ) − V ).
To illustrate the hedonic aspect to wages in this example, consider the wage at

36

the maximum utility promise,
w1 (V̄1 ( p) , p) = p1 ( p)
w0 (V̄0 ( p) , p) = p0 ( p) − χ (γ (V̄0 ( p) , p)) + γ (V̄0 ( p) , p) Π1 (Y (V̄0 ( p) , p)) .
This is the particularly simple case where all the rents from the relationship are
delivered to the worker. For the experienced worker, there is no training and so
there is no compensating differential to wages. However, for the inexperienced
worker, wages do reflect the cost of the training, χ (γ (V̄0 ( p) , p)), that is being
provided. However, the cost subtraction is modified by the firm’s expected profit
gains when the worker becomes experienced, γ (V̄0 ( p) , p) Π1 (Y (V̄0 ( p) , p)). In
principle, it is possible that the expected profits to the firm exceed the cost, in
which case the worker is paid more than productivity, p0 ( p).
5.1.2 Steady state equilibrium
For experience level i = 0, 1, denote by ui the mass of experience level i workers
that are unemployed. Similarly, let ei denote the mass of employed experience
level i workers. In addition, denote by gi (V, p) the mass of experience level
i = 0, 1 workers that are employed in productivity p firms with utility promise
V. Denote by λi = λi (Ui , 0) the search intensity of an unemployed experience
level i = 0, 1 worker. Denote by Gi (V, p) the associated cumulative distribution
function. In steady state, worker inflows and outflows must equal each other,
which implies,
u0 ( λ0 + m ) = e 0 δ + m
u1 ( λ1 + m ) = e 1 δ
e0 (γ̄ + m + δ) = u0 λ0
e1 (m + δ) = u1 λ1 + e0 γ̄

37

where the first equation utilizes that the flow of newborns into the unemployment pool equals m by the normalization that u0 + u1 + e0 + e1 = 1. Furthermore,

It is worth noting that keeping track of the distribution of utility promises in the
match distribution is quite straightforward in the continuation time formulation.
The above expressions equalize the flows in and out of the pools of experience
i workers in productivity p or less firms that are in receipt of utility V or less,
ei Gi ( p, V ). The change in utility promise over time in the contracts results in
´p
V̇0 (V, p′ ) g0 (V, p′ ) dp′ . Given that utility promises
an outflow equal to,
−1

change smoothly over time in the optimal contracts, the only workers that can
leave the pool at a given point in time, are the ones in the pool that receive exactly
h
i
V, which can happen in a range of different productivity p′ ∈ V̄0−1 (V ) , p firms.

These workers leave the pool at rate, V̇0 (V, p′ ).

The Appendix details the numerical details of solving for Gi (V, p). It turns
out to be an almost lower triangular system and it solves rather simply by forward
recursion.

where λ is a “free” level of search that the worker is given reflecting an assumption that worker search is possibly not an essential input into the creation of
matches. In this formulation, the search intensity choice is constrained such that
λ ∈ [λ, ∞).9 Assume Φ (·) is a beta distribution with parameters ( β 0 , β 1 ). Let
the production function for i = 0, 1 be given by pi ( p) = 0.2 (1 + i ) + p. Table 1

The parameters have been chosen with the purpose of providing a useful illustration of the key mechanisms in the model more so than fitting to reasonable empirical outcomes. I have specifically chosen a parameterization which
illustrates that the model can well produce negative wages, just like the basic
Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) model. Most empirical applications would impose
non-negativity in which case, the parameterization in this example would involve
ex ante rent extraction. That is not the focus of the current parameterization, but
it illustrates that design constraints such as lower wage bounds may be important
features to include in an empirical study. This of course is also the point in Flinn
and Mabli (2009). On the other hand, it is also quite possible that with an empirically reasonable firm productivity support, lower wage bounds just happen to

is a minor violation of Assumption A4, but poses no problem for the analysis.

In figure 1, I show how the optimal employment contracts dictate search intensities at the value bounds for the firm type in question. Given that the example
does not have a minimum wage or other design constraints that allow for ex
ante rent extraction, the worker has no incentive to search when given the firm’s
willingness to pay, and therefore search is just at the zero cost level, λ. When
offered less than that, the worker searches more and as can be seen, the more
potential there is for rent extraction, the more the worker searches. The hardest
searching worker in this example is the inexperienced worker that has just been
hired directly out of unemployment into the best firm. The inexperienced worker
hired directly out of unemployment searches more intensely than an experienced
worker in the same situation for two reasons: The higher level of income for
the experienced worker is associated with an income effect that reduces search
intensity supply. In addition, a given firm type can also provide training to an
inexperienced worker, which increases the match surplus (net of unemployment
value) relative to that of an experienced worker. Thus, the inexperienced worker’s
search has greater rent extraction potential.

Figure 2 shows the median firm type employment contract for an inexperienced worker. The worker will start employment with the firm at some initial
utility promise depending on the worker’s labor market history. The left top panel

41

shows the worker’s search intensity as a function of the current utility promise.
The worker’s incentive to search for outside options are proportional to the possible rents the worker has yet to extract from the current match. Once at full rent
extraction, the worker’s search is reduced to λ.
The top right hand panel shows the rate of change in the utility promise over
tenure with the firm. If the worker meets an outside firm, it is possible that the
contract renegotiation will result in a jump in the utility value with the firm to
some higher level V ′ in which case employment will continue from that point under the new contract. The right top panel shows the two sources of utility promise
growth within the worker’s current job. V̇0 (V ) is the contracted upon change in
utility over time. V̇0ren (V ) is the expected change in the inexperienced worker’s
lifetime utility due to contract renegotiation caused by outside offer arrival. For an
experience level i = 0, 1 worker, expected growth due to renegotiation is defined
by,

In a wage contract without back loading such as (Postel-Vinay and Robin, 2002) all
of within job wage growth comes from the V̇iren (V ) channel. In the current example, the contract is delivering substantially more wage growth through contracted
upon backloading than through the renegotiation channel. Thus, the model delivers within job wage growth motivated by the threat of contract renegotiation and
wasteful search, but in this case, with much less actual outside offer matching.
The middle left panel shows the inexperienced worker wage as a function of
the utility promise. It also shows the output of the match p0 ( pmed ). In accordance
with Proposition 1, wages are increasing in the utility promise. In this case, the
wage at the firm’s willingness to pay is slightly less than the output of the match
which reflects the costs and profit gains to the firm from providing training to

42

the worker. The right middle panel shows the continuation utility promise as the
worker moves from low skill to high skill. For low utility promises, the choice of
X (V ) is at the lower bound, X (V ) = U1 . The implication for the wage path as the
worker moves from low skill to high skill are shown in the lower left panel. The
solid green line is the wage for the inexperienced worker and the solid black line
is the wage the worker receives immediately following becoming experienced.
When the choice of X (V ) is not in a corner, it is seen that the wage does not
change as the worker becomes high skill, but in the corner the wage jumps up.
The bottom right hand panel shows the training intensity which is increasing
in the utility promise. For low utility promises, the worker is searching more
intensely which increases the competitive pressure on the match which in turn
reduces the firm’s returns to training the worker. As the utility promise increases,
the worker’s search intensity decreases and training intensity increases.
Figure 3 shows the median firm employment contract for the experienced
worker. Backloading of wages is also a central feature of the contract in this
case, but less so here because the income effect has lowered the elasticity of the
worker’s search intensity response to the utility promise. In addition, since training is no longer valuable, the net surplus is relatively smaller. As a result, the
utility promise growth rate is smaller and while not directly shown, this is also
the case for the wage growth rate. As was the case for the inexperienced worker,
wage growth is primarily due to the built in growth in the contract as opposed
to renegotiation and the associated outside offer matching. The lower right hand
panel shows the profit value to the firm as a confirmation of the result in Proposition 1 that it is monotonically decreasing and concave, and takes zero value at
the willingness to pay.
The following figures show some of the characteristics of the steady state. The
top left panel in Figure 4 shows the firm type offer distribution φ ( p) and the
steady state match distribution over firm types g ( p), which stochastically dominates φ ( p) as it must in this model. The top right panel and the two middle panels
show the firm type conditional average wage, training intensity, and search inten-

sity in steady state. In all three cases, the relationship is non-monotone, and for
much the same reason: The non-monotonicity of wages in firm productivity is
a general feature of the Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) type wage setting process
and is also emphasized in Bagger and Lentz (2013). If anything the backloading
in the paper at hand amplifies the feature. Consider the case of an experienced
worker employed by a type p = 0 firm. The outside option of unemployment is
equal to the maximal utility promise V̄1 (0) = U1 that the firm can offer. Consequently, the wage contract is simply w1 (U1 , 0) = p1 (0) = 0.4. Now, consider
the wage in matches with a somewhat more productive firm type, p = 0.1. If a

to pay, V̄1 (0.1), the worker would again be receiving a flat profile exactly equal
to match output, w1 (V̄1 (0.1) , 0.1) = p1 (0.1) = 0.5, which of course exceeds that
of the p = 0 type firm. However, this is not the typical kind of worker that is em44

ployed in this firm. The match distribution has more mass towards a bargaining
position of unemployment because the arrival of outside offers most often result
45

in the worker leaving the firm rather than staying with a renegotiated contract.
Given a bargaining position of unemployment, wages are substantially lower in
anticipation of higher wages with future firms and as part of the backloading of
the wage contract with the current firm. This is also why the average worker in
the p = 0.1 firm searches more intensely than the one in the p = 0 type firm.
And because of the associated greater competitive pressure, the average training
intensity is lower in the p = 0.1 firm.
Of course, this non-monotonicity should not distract the analysis from the
more important effect that in general, more productive firms pay higher wages
and supply more training.
The two lower panels in Figure 4 show the average firm type conditional within
job wage growth rates for low and high skill workers. This is average observed
growth rate of a randomly selected individual from a given firm conditional on
the worker staying with the firm. The bold line shows the total wage growth rate.
The thin solid line is the wage growth rate built into the contract, and the dashed
thin line is the growth rate in wages that is contributed to renegotiation of wages
due to outside offer arrivals. For the high skill workers the bold line is the sum of
the growth rates of the two thin lines. For low skill workers, wages can jump due
to skill increase, but only if their utility promise as a low skill worker is less than
the value of unemployment as a high skill worker, in which case the firm’s choice
of continuation utility promise is at a corner. Otherwise, the wage path will be
flat over a skill jump. Consequently, the expected total wage growth rate of a low
skill worker exceeds the sum of the contractual wage growth rate and growth due
to renegotiation. This is true more so for low type firms than high type firms due
to the greater likelihood that wages must jump when the worker’s skill jumps for
these firms.
The lower panels in Figure 4 illustrate another important point: In lower productivity firms the vast majority of wage growth is built directly into the contract
and almost none is due to outside offer matching. In more productive firms the
two sources become more evenly split. If one were to ask a manager in a low

productivity firm whether wages are set and workers are retained by matching
outside offers, the answer could well be no. If a worker receives an outside offer,
the outside firm as almost always better and the worker leaves. In more productive firms the answer would be that on occasion the firm retains a worker by
matching outside offers which would then result in a raise.
Finally, Figure 5 shows the training intensity in the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile firms. The figure reveals an interesting feature of the employment contracts: For a given utility promise, training is decreasing in the productivity of the
firm, which is a reflection of search intensity being increasing in firm productivity for a given utility promise. Figure 1 also makes this point. For a given utility
promise, the rents that the worker can extract from the current relationship are
increasing in the productivity of the firm, and so the worker searches harder. The
greater exposure to outside competition lowers the firm’s returns to training the
worker and so it chooses a lower training intensity.
The result is not in contradiction with the generally positive correlation be47

tween training and firm productivity that is illustrated in Figure 4 because workers tend to receive greater utility with more productive firms. Figure 5 emphasizes the point that to obtain high training intensity, it is not enough to simply
meet a good firm, the worker must accumulate bargaining position either through
the contracted upon growth rate in the utility promise or through meetings with
outside firms.

6 Concluding remarks
The paper presents a tractable framework for the study of wage dynamics with
rich productive heterogeneity on both worker and firm sides and optimally chosen wage-tenure contracts. The model emphasizes the role of hidden search which
gives the firm incentive to backload wage contracts so as to preempt workers from
engaging in search that is primarily motivated by rent extraction from the current
match.
The paper presents proof of existence and uniqueness of the wage mechanism
as well as characterization of its key properties. It is shown that the design problem can be formulated as a contraction mapping which then provides the core of
the proof strategies. With this, existence and uniqueness is established and the
firm’s profit value of the match is shown to be monotonically decreasing, concave, and differentiable in the utility promise to the worker. The contract will
be backloaded meaning that the utility promise to the worker is monotonically
increasing in tenure. Wages are shown to be increasing in the utility promise and
the worker’s search intensity is decreasing in the promise. Therefore, even in the
absence of outside offer arrivals, the worker’s wages will be increasing in tenure
and the separation hazard will be declining.
The example in the paper demonstrates the ease with which the framework
can accommodate empirically relevant accumulation processes in for example human capital. This is encouraging evidence that the framework can provide a useful foundation for the empirical study of wage dynamics. The example also has

48

considerable independent interest in that it demonstrates a plausible mechanism
for firm provided general human capital training and it links search frictions with
human capital accumulation. It is shown that more productive firms will provide
more training. For a given firm, training intensity is increasing in the utility
promise because the higher utility promise cements the worker’s position with
the firm by reducing his search for outside options.

A Solution Algorithm for Continuous Time Training
Model.
A.1 The optimal contract
In the continuous case, there is no contraction mapping to work with for a value
function iteration scheme. Of course, one can iterate on equation (10) for very
small ∆, however one would expect very slow convergence. Instead, one can
adopt the following algorithm: Given the assumption that human capital can
only grow, the model lends itself to a solution that starts at the experienced level
where there is no training decision, and with a solution for wage contracts for
experienced workers in hand, one can then proceed to solve for wage contracts
for inexperienced workers.
First, determine V̄1 ( p) and U1 . With this, the optimal contract for a given
type can be solved for a given firm type independent of the other firm types
(which also suggests an obvious parallelization strategy if multiple processors are
available). For any given firm type, the contracting problem is initialized at the
willingness to pay, V̄1 ( p). Here it is known that,
V̇1 (V̄1 ( p) , p) = 0
w1 (V̄1 ( p) , p) = p1 ( p)
λ1 (V̄1 ( p) , p) = 0
Π1 (V̄1 ( p) , p) = 0
Π1′ (V̄1 ( p) , p) =

−1
.
u′ ( p1 ( p))

For numerical purposes, discretize the state space {V1i }iN=1 such that V11 = U
and V1N = V̄1 ( p). There will be more curvature in the problem as V goes
to V̄1 ( p) and so it may make sense to adopt a grid that is denser on the right
hand side, although this is not essential. Equation (21) immediately provides the
search choice for any utility promise grid point {λ1i }iN=1 . It then remains to deter50

5. By equation (24), this finally delivers the implied utility promise for the

given wage guess, (ρ + δ) Ṽ1i = u (w1i ) − c (λ1i ) + δU1 + λ1i V1i1 F̂1 (V ′ ) dV ′ +
V̇1i .

The optimal wage contract is found such that Di (wi ) = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , N.
Start the algorithm from i = N − 1 and loop down to i = 1.
With the optimal contracts for experienced workers in hand, proceed to solve
for the optimal inexperienced worker contract for a given firm type, p. First step is
to determine firm p’s willingness to pay, V̄0 ( p). When the firm is delivering utility
V = V̄0 ( p) to the inexperienced worker, there is for the worker no additional
surplus to extract from the match and the incentive compatibility constraint is
non-binding implying that the Lagrange multiplier is zero, µ0 ( p) = 0. As a
consequence the utility promise growth rate is also zero at the willingness to pay,
V̇0 (V̄0 ( p) , p) = 0. Therefore, one obtains that V̄0 ( p) satisfies,

(ρ + δ + γ) V̄0 ( p) = u (w0 (V̄0 ( p) , p)) + δU0 + γ (V̄0 ( p) , p) X (V̄0 ( p) , p) ,
where
w0 (V̄0 ( p) , p) = p0 ( p) − χ (γ (V̄0 ( p) , p)) + γ (V̄0 ( p) , p) Π1 ( X (V̄0 ( p) , p)) ,
51

which follows from the definition of the willingness to pay, Π0 (V̄0 ( p) , p) = 0.
The training rate and the utility promise at the transition from inexperienced to
experienced satisfy the first order conditions,
χ′ (γ (V̄0 ( p) , p)) = Π1 (X (V̄0 ( p) , p)) +

1
[ X (V̄0 ( p) , p) − V̄0 ( p)]

and

X (V̄0 ( p) , p) =

Π′−1 (Π′ (V̄0 ( p) , p) , p)

if Π1′ (U1 , p) ≥ Π0′ (V̄0 ( p) , p) .

This is 3 equations in 3 unknowns, and can be solved for a given firm type independent of knowing the optimal contracts for any other firm type.
Given the value of V̄0 ( p) proceed as above to define a grid {V0i }iN=1 over the
2
interval [U0 , V̄0 ( p)]. Again, define the distance D0i (w) = V0i − Ṽ0i (w) as follows,

1. set wi = w.
′ = u ′ ( w ).

The optimal contract is found by solving D0i (wi ) = 0 for i = 1, . . . , N. Again,
start from i = N − 1 and loop down to i = 1. It’s worth noting that there are some
checks that can be done for the sake of accuracy. The algorithm above integrates

The solution algorithm starts by solving for G0 (V, p) by use of equation (48). For
a given γ̄, the discretized system of equations can be written as a lower triangular linear equation system, which solves quickly by trivial forward recursion.
Except for the true value of γ̄, the solution will involve G0 (1, V̄0 (1)) 6= 1, which
is of course a violation of the definition of G0 (V, p). However, this is only a multiplicative level problem on the probability density. Hence, rescale the density
so that the solution is characterized by, G0 (1, V̄0 (1)) = 1. With this, the correct
´ 1 ´ V̄ ( p′ )
γ (V ′ , p′ ) dG0 (V ′ , p′ ) .
average training intensity can be determined, γ̄ = 0 U 0
With a solution for G0 (V, p) in hand, proceed to solve for G1 (V, p) by use

of equation (49). Again, for a given discretization of the state space, the system
of equations can be written up as a lower triangular set of linear equations and
solved quickly by forward recursion.
