    "abstract": "\n\nLabor market search-and-matching models posit supply-side responses to minimum wage increases that may lead to improved matches and lessen or even reverse negative employment e\ufb00ects. Yet there is sparse empirical evidence on this crucial assumption. Using event study analysis of recent minimum wage increases, we \ufb01nd that these changes do not a\ufb00ect the likelihood of searching, but do lead to large yet very transitory spikes in search e\ufb00ort by individuals already looking for work. These results are not driven by changes in the composition of searchers.\n\n",
