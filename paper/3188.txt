REAL WAGE DETERMINATION IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS

ABSTRACT

This paper studies the determinants of real wage rates using data on
Canadian labour contracts signed between 1978 and 1984.

Its results are

consistent with Dunlop's neglected (1944) hypothesis that real pay movements
are shaped by product price changes (contrary to the predictions of implicit

contract theory and other models of wage inflexibility). The level of the

unemployment rate is found

to

lower

the

real wage level with an

elasticity between -0.04 and -0.13, whereas a Phillips Curve specification

which relates wage changes to the level of the unemployment rate is not
convincingly supported by the data. These results may be seen as consistent
with the view that collective bargaining is a form of rent-sharing in which
external unemployment weakens workers' bargaining strength.

Introduction
The wage rate is often seen as one of the most important prices in the

economy. It shapes the distribution of income, the levels of employment and

unemployment, and the participation and effort decisions of individual
workers. Despite its apparent significance, however, the wage determination
process remains complex and controversial. Some ideas, such as the Phillips

curve, have received extraordinary scrutiny.

Other issues, such as wage

rigidity theorems hysteresis and the bargaining framework which determines
wage/employment outcomes, have received little empirical attention.

This paper has two principal novel aspects. It studies the effects on

real wazes of (i) the level of unemployment and (ii) industry product
prices. The conceptual framework underlying this approach is a bargaining
analysis in which rents are divided between the firm and the trade union.
High industry selling prices lead to a large surplus to be divided.

High

unemloyment acts to weaken workers' relative bargaining strength.

The empirical framework here differs from that of a conventional
Phillips Curve model. In that approach, unemployment is seen as a measure
of excess demand for labour, and a disequilibrium wage-adjustment mechanism

is assumed.

Empirically this framework works unpredictably.

Our study

considers instead the possibility that there is a long-run relationship
between the wage level and the unemployment level. Although this is an idea

going at least as far back as Sargan (1964), it has been largely ignored
except by a small number of economists at the London School of Economics.

A related set of issues is the extent to which insider forces and
hysteresis help shape the real wage rate.
these ideas can be readily examined.

Given our empirical framework,

Section 2 and the Appendix survey these theoretical issues and suggest
the empirical framework that may be used to examine them. Section 3 reviews

the data used, while Section 4 discusses our empirical findings. A summary

and

concluding observations appear in Section 5.

2. Theoretical Issues

The possible dependence of the rate of wage change on the level of
unemployment, made famous by the work of Phillips (1958), was examined in an

immense literature during the l960s and lOs.

Sy the middle of the l980s,

however, there was no consensus as to the role of unemployment in the wage
determination process. Much of the early literature is surveyed in Laidler
and Parkin (1975); more recent contributions include Chriscofides, Swidinsky

and Wilton (1980), Beckerman and Jenkinson (1986) and Grubb (1986).
Although some investigators have found evidence for a negative relationship

between wage change and the level of unemployment, a plethora of results
exists and faith in Phillips' original conception is diminished.
In part because of such dissatisfaction, a newer tradition has recently
emerged.

Work by Newell and Symons (1985), Layard and Nickell (1986),

Nickell (1987), Carruth and Oswald (1987) and others at the London School of

Economics

has attempted to estimate a real wage

equation.

unemployment rate is taken as a key independent variable in

The

form of

According to this new approach, the unemployment rate is not a

measure of excess demand or supply which affects the speed of wage
adjustment during disequilibrium.

Instead, it shapes the real wage in

equilibrium by influencing the relative bargaining strength of firms and
workers (or unions). For this reason, unemployment has a long run effect on

2

the level of real wages. A more complete formal

statement

of this approach

is contained in the Appendix.

In a later section we examine empirically both the Phillips Curve and
this, more recent, hypothesis on the role of unemployment. Previous work of
this kind goes back to Sargan's (1964) pioneering study and includes Newell

and Symons (1986), who study the roles of tax
nominal rigidity using UK data.

In

and price 'wedges' and

contrast, this paper estimates real wage

change equations and focuses upon the issue of whether it is unemployment or

its rate of change which enters such equations with a negative sign -

see

Vanderkamp (1972). Unlike Newell and Symons (1986), who use aggregate data,

we rely on data drawn from individual wage agreements signed in the Canadian
unionised sector between 1978-1984.

A second question of interest is whether wage rates are determined in
part by product prices.

To quote from a key, but routinely over-looked,

passage in Dunlop (1944, p. 146),
".. .The central theme is that declines in product prices
and not unemployment constitute the effective downward
pressure on wage structures."

This idea contradicts the much more recent belief of wage rigidity in the
face of sectoral price movements.

Implicit contract theory

(e.g.,

Baily

(1974), Gordon (1974) and Azariadis (1975)), efficiency wage theory (e.g.,
Solow (1979), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984), and Yellen (1984)) and some trade
union models (e.g., McDonald and Solow (1981)) all bear upon the flexibility

of pay in the face of product price changes. Wage rigidity theorems along

such lines have become a routine part of modern economic theory. Yet

economists, but they are also largely untested1.

allow the wage rigidity hypothesis to be evaluated in a straightforward way.
The industry's price can be entered as an explanatory variable in a contract

wage equation. In this context, simultaneity bias should be minimal because

of the micro nature of the dependent variable and because some of the
regressors are firm specific -- see Kennan (1988).

The analysis of so-called insider-outsider theories

-

stressed

recently by Solow (1985), Blanchard and Sumisers (1986), Gregory (1986),
Lindbeck and Snower (1986) and Gottfries and Horn (1987), among others-suggests that movements in wages are governed more by internal pressure than

external pressure. In contrast to the theory of competitive labour markets,

this branch of labour market theory implies that a firm's pay depends

principally upon its own employment changes and product market
characteristics.

In this literature, aggregate unemployment has little or

no effect on the real wage rate.

Instead, it depends on lagged employment

and demand shift variables2.

The three strands of literature surveyed in this section can be
investigated using the framework outlined in the Appendix.

As indicated

there, firms and unions are assumed to maximize the weighted product of
their utilities above their faliback positions with respect to employment

and the wage rate. This process results in an equation for the wage rate
which depends on the alternative wage rate, union membership, the average

to expect that a reduction in the number of incumbent workers will lead to

price of competing firm goods, a demand shock variable, firm fixed costs and

the consumer price index. The alternative wage rate in turn depends on the
prevailing regional wage, unemployment insurance benefits and their duration
as well as the unemployment rate itself.

The wage equation can be estimated in either real or nominal form.
Early work on Phillips Curves assumed that nominal wage chanze depends upon

the unemployment J.. Later variants added the nominal rate of change of

prices as another independent variable --

thereby converting to the

assumption that real wage change depends upon the unemployment level. The
approach outlined in the Appendix assumes instead that the real wage

The Data

Much of the North-American work on Phillips Curves uses micro,
contract-based, data rather than the more standard aggregate time series
variables.

This approach, which originates with Hamermesh (1970), has

advantages, particularly in the present context where bargaining
considerations are assumed to drive microeconomic agents.

Wage agreement

data reflect, as closely as can be hoped, the theory outlined in the
Appendix.

There appear to be no published studies using this Canadian

information in the context of bargaining models.

5

The equations reported

below link the extensive microeconometric literature on the Phillips Curve,

which works with rates of change of nominal wage variables, to the London
School of Economics literature that deals with real wage level equations.

The data used in this study were made available to us by Labour Canada

and are drawn from contracts reached between 420 establishments and 68
unions in a wide variety of Canadian industries3. These contracts involve
500 or more employees and were arrived at in the private, non-contro].led4,

sector between l978Ql and 1984Q4.

The data tape contains information on

1015 contracts. A number of variables are reported for each agreement.
These include the effective and expiry dates of the current and previous
contract, the number of employees at the beginning of the current and past
contracts, the nominal base wage rate at the end of the previous agreement

as well as the total non-contingent wage increase implemented during the
current contract.

It is, therefore, possible to measure the real wage rate

both at the end of the previous and at the beginning of the current

These include Mining, Logging, several aspects of Manufacturing,

Trade and Services.

Data on the construction industry are not available

prior to 1983 and are not included in this sample.

'

During 1982Q3 to 1983Q4, a number of federal and provincial

programmes attempted to regulate pay in the public and para-public (i.e.

Education, Health, Federal and Provincial Administration and parts of
Transportation, Communications and Utilities) sectors.

All agreements

subject to such controls were excluded from the present sample by Labour
Canada.

Nevertheless, these programmes may have had an impact on wage

determination in the private sector, a possibility which

agreement.

The Consumer Price Index is included in the original data and

has a base of 1971 — 100.

This is used both to deflate nominal magnitudes

and as variable c in the Appendix. Real wage rates evaluated at the end of

the previous contract are denoted by (-I). Industry product price indices
were obtained from the 1986 Cansim tape and were appended to the contract
data -

they set 1981 — 100.

The demand shift variable (z) was proxied by

real industry GOP5. A federal controls dummy variable is also contained in
the original Labour Canada tape.

In order to implement the discussion of section 2 and the Appendix, it

is necessary to specify the ingredients of the alternative wage rate (u).
This is assumed to be a function of the regional wage rate (r) ,

defined

as

average weekly earnings in the same province and SIC classification, the

statutory amount of unemployment insurance available to a worker in the

region and year, the statutory duration of that benefit level and the
regional unemployment rate6.

The regional unemployment rates used are

contained in the original Labour Canada tape.

5

To each contract was assigned the real GDP (1971 dollars)

generated in the same industry (ten industries are distinguished) in the

year in which the previous contract became effective.

Review, Ottawa, Department of Finance, 1985.

The average weekly earnings data is available from the Cansim

tape. The unemployment insurance benefit and duration data were obtained
from Unernolovinent Insurance, Ottawa: Employment and Immigration, September

1985. The benefits and duration of benefits in the province and year of the
unit's previous agreement were assigned to each contract.

7

Before proceeding to specify empirical versions of equation (A.7),

certain issues peculiar to contract data must be dealt with.

Wage

agreements reached in Canada and North-America generally last for long
periods of time, entail a small number of nominal wage revisions which tend

to be front-loaded and have no, or limited, cost-of-living allowance
clauses. For these reasons the real wage rate can be expected to be at its

highest at the beginning of a contract because that is when most nominal
wage adjustment occurs. The magnitude of this saw-tooth effect in the real
wage rate depends on the degree of indexation built into a contract and the

expected inflation rate over the life of the contract.

The greater the

elasticity of indexation, the smaller the need to front-load wage
increases. For a given number of wage revisions7, the longer the contract's
duration and the greater the expected annual inflation rate, the greater the

need to set a high real wage rate at the start of a contract. Given that
the real wage rate variable on the data tape is measured at the beginning of

the contract, it is necessary to augment equation (A.7) to take account of
these issues.

Thus the average -j elasticity

of indexation over the

current contract, the length of the contract itself and the expected annual

inflation rate are included in our empirical equations below.

These

variables are part of the original Labour Canada tape. The coefficients on
the expected annual inflation rate and contract duration should be positive,
while that on the elasticity of indexation should be negative.

No information on this variable is available in this particular
sample otherwise this would have been a useful additional regressor with an

expected negative coefficient. See Christofides (1982) for further
discussion of this issue.

sample of 595 observations remained. Tables 2 and 3 retain a constant term

in order to allow for possible trends in the level equations.

Similar

results were obtained when constants were excluded8.

Column I, Table 2, reports an equation corresponding to equation (A.7)
in the Appendix. As Dunlop (1944) would have predicted, industry prices and

CDP have positive signs and are statistically significant at the 5Z level.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that workers share in product market
prosperity.

The regional unemployment rate is also statistically significant at the

51 level and has an elasticity of -0.069.

We interpret this as an

unemployment effect on workers bargaining strength.

When outside

opportunities worsen, workers wages inside the firm are depressed.

8

To the extent that the error terms in the level equations are

white noise, the error terms in the change equations are MA(l) and some

efficiency gains remain unexploited. Realizing these gains is bedevilled by
the unbalanced nature of the sample which results from varying contract

lengths. Some preliminary work suggests that the MA(l) structure appears to
be weak.
9

The variable which indicates the presence of wage controls in public

sector contracts signed between 1982Q3-l984Q2 is significant, suggesting
small effects on private sector wage agreements. The regional wage rate (r)
is statistically significant at the 5% level and has an elasticity of 0.133.

However, the signs on the UI benefit variables are somewhat puzzling; it is

conceivable that this is because of multicollinearity with regional
unemployment9.

This argument is consistent with the results reported in

column 2, Table 2. When

the

benefit variables are dropped, the coefficient

and t statistic on the regional unemployment rate increase substantially in

absolute size. Column 3, Table 2, introduces the variables discussed on p.
8 above.

The elasticity of indexation, contract duration and the expected

inflation rate all have the expected signs, sizeable coefficients and are
statistically significant at the 5% level. The real wage rate prevailing at
the end of the previous contract has the expected sign and is significant at

the 5% level, but its effect is small. The addition of these "accounting"
variables and the past real wage rate improves considerably the fit of the

equation: the adjusted R2 jumps from 0.476 in column 1 to 0.708 in column
3, Table 2. Given the cross-sectional nature of much of the data, this is a
satisfactory fit.

Column 3, Table 2 shows that the significance of the

industry GDP variable is substantially reduced; the coefficients on and the

The simple correlation coefficients between the change in the
logarithms of UI Benefits, UI Benefit Duration and the regional unemployment

rate are 0.13 and 0.78 respectively. We chose not to combine the statutory
information on unemployment insurance variables into a single variable in
order to avoid imposing a constraint.

statistical significance of other variables are not substantially
affected10.

Columns 4 and 5, Table 2, begin an exploration of the issue of whether
it is the change or the level of the regional unemployment rate that affects

real wage change.

It is clear that the level does not perform nearly as

well as the change in the regional unemployment rate, a fact which is
inconsistent with the standard Phillips curve model.

Column 5, Table 2

confirms the effects of multicollinearity between the benefit and
unemployment rate variables:

relative to column 4, Table 2, the change in

the unemployment rate variable has a smaller coefficient and a substantially
reduced t value.

The comparison between the Phillips curve specification and
specifications based on equation (A.7) is continued in Table 3. This table

specifies equations which, given the nature of the dependent variable,
approximate as closely as possible equations estimated in the Phillips curve

literature.

These equations include spillover variables which may be

proxied by the regional wage rate.

The CPI is included in order not to

exclude the possibility of some degree of money illusion; it also shortcircuits the formation of inflationary expectations.

Controls variables

are, of course, standard in the Phillips curve approach. The current
accounting variables are included in order to better specify the real wage
equations.

which sit reasonably well with the Phillips

However, there is no doubt that these specifications are

dominated by the change-on-change equations of columns 2 and 5, Table 3.
This is confirmed in the encompassing equations of the same table. It is
noteworthy, however, that the equations in Table 3 are not as successful as
those of Table 2.

Returning to the latter, columns 6 and 7 check on some implications of

the insider/outsider literature. The change in the logarithm of the lagged
employment variable12 is not statistically significant, and has a positive
sign --

to the expectation of Blanchard and Summers (1986).

In

addition, the exclusion of the unemployment variables damages the overall
goodness of fit. This is to be expected, of course, given the consistently
useful role played by the change in the unemployment rate variable.

The final column of Table 2 omits the variables which proxy the impact

of the business cycle on firms in particular industries13 .

The product

price variable is particularly robust and statistically significant at the

5% level and its omission is clearly inappropriate.

Dunlop's (1944)

hypothesis thus appears to be consistent with these results, though the
results also suggest a role for unemployment. These findings may also be

equations do not favour the wage rigidity predictions discussed earlier.
Tables 2 and 3 were re-estimated using the regional unemployment rate

prevailing during the quarter in which an agreement became effectiverather than the rate prevailing during the quarter in which the previous
agreement expired.

The results obtained were similar to those discussed

above and are, therefore, not reported.

Several other variables, which

proved to be not terribly useful, were also considered. These include the
industrial relations stage at which an agreement was reached, the size of
the union and a dummy variable which assumed the value of unity for unions
which signed more than arbitrary numbers of contracts.

Conclusion

This paper has attempted to uncover the factors which shape the
behaviour of real wage rates. It uses a sample of labour contracts signed
in the unionized sector of the Canadian economy between 1978 and 1984, and

merges this with extra information on the employing firms' industries and
regions.

There are three principal conclusions.

First, the real wage rate at

the microeconomic level is inversely related to the unemployment rate in the

employer's region. Estimates of the unemployment elasticity of wages ranged

between -0.04 and -0.13.

Only limited support was found for the

traditional approach in which wage changes depend upon the unemployment
level; it appears that the level of the real wage rate depends more strongly

and reliably upon the level of the unemployment rate.

Second, there is

strong evidence in favour of Dunlop's (1944) hypothesis that real wage

13

movements are sensitive to real product price changes14. This is consistent

with recent ideas (eg. Solow (1985)) concerning how 'insiders' convert
demand shocks into higher pay, but is inconsistent with the wage rigidity

proposition of implicit contract theory and of other models of pay
inflexibility.

Third, current contract wages do not appear to depend

negatively upon the level of employment in the previous contract.

If

anything, this relationship was weakly positive.

These results are consistent with the view that collective bargaining

may be seen as a process of rent-sharing.

When an industry has high

selling prices, its workers benefit in the form of higher real earnings.

High unemployment in the outside labour market, however, acts to weaken
workers' bargaining power. The greater the unemployment rate, the lower the
real wage.

14 New work, on British panel data, by Nickell and Wadhwarii (1987)
also identifies a product price effect, although the authors interpret it
somewhat differently. Carruth, Oswald and Findlay (1986) report a real wage
equation for steelworkers in which the steel price enters significantly.

issues are available in Oswald (1985) and Pencavel (1985).

The alternative or outside wage, , may itself depend upon a number of
variables. It is assumed that it can be written as

—

w(r,

b, d, U)

(A.3)

in which r is the regional wage rate, b is the unemployment benefit, d is

the duration of the unemployment benefit and U is the unemployment rate in
the region.

Hence w is to be thought of as a function of the level of pay

in the firm's own geographical area, and also of the level of income if jobs

cannot be found, namely of the unemployment benefit level. The probability
of finding work at rate r, rather than being unemployed at rate b, depends
upon the prevailing unemployment rate U.

It is convenient to follow the common practice of assuming that
bargaining can be modelled using the Nash (1953) solution.

This can be

given an axiomatic justification or may be justified by appealing to a noncooperative game theoretic framework, in which the two sides are allowed to

the

possibility that incomes policy affects the real wage is

explored in the empirical section.

If there is a breakdown in negotiations, the two agents receive only

their delay utilities (denoted by a ).

Bargaining power stems from the

ability to enjoy a relatively large delay utility. In the case of the firm
it is assumed that

a dispute but may find work

Unemployment, U, affects the probability of workers doing

so. It is plausible to assume that V is a declining function of U. On this
view workers' bargaining ability is weakened by outside unemployment.

The Nash bargaining problem then maximizes expression (A.4) using
equations (A.l), (A.2), (A.3), (A.5) and (A.6). The solution lies upon the

contract curve defined by the locus of tangencies between employer and
employee preferences. Using w to denote the wage outcome, equilibrium is
given by the function

*

— w (r, b, U, c, in, p, z, k)

.

(A.7)

This is almost identical to the wage equation of a monopoly union model the
difference being that in a bargaining context fixed costs, k, matter because

they influence the firm's utility in the event of a breakdown in
negotiations.

Equation (A.7) can be rewritten in real terms by deflating by the
consumer price index, c. If nominal prices have no effect, i.e. there is no

money-illusion, the variable c will drop out of the right hand side of the
equation.
