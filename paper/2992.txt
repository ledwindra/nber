THE SOURCES OF FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE
INVENTORIES AND GNP

ABSTRACT
A simple real linear-quadratic inventory model is used to determine how
cost and demand shocks interacted to cause fluctuations in aggregate GNP and
inventories in the U.S., 1947-1986. Cost shocks appear to be the predominant
source of fluctuations in inventories, and are largely responsible for the
well known fact that GNP is more variable than final sales. Cost and demand
shocks are of roughly equal importance for GNP. These estimates are, however,
imprecise. With a different, but plausible, value for a certain target
inventory-sales ratio, cost shocks are less important than demand shocks for
GNP fluctuations.

I. Introduction
This paper is concerned with how real cost and demand shocks interact to
determine aggregate real inventories and ClIP in the postwar United States. Its aim
is to answer such questions as; Do inventories respond mainly to demand shocks

(Holt et al. [1960])? Are demand

shocks

of secondary importance in explaining

fluctuations in CNP (Prescott [1986a,b])? What is the dynamic pattern of the
response of inventories to cost and demand shocks? Of CNP (Blanchard and Quah
[1988])?

A long tradition attributes the bulk of movements in inventories to demand
shocks. Accelerator models, pioneered by Metzler [1941] and Lovell (1961], posit
that inventories are proportional to expected sales. Production smoothing models,
pioneered by Holt at al. (1960], suggest that because of increasing marginal Costs
of production, the desire to smooth production relative to demand will also cause
adjustment of inventories in response to demand.
Some recant evidence has, however, suggested that inventories may also (or

instead) be responding to cost shocks. One simple stylized fact that suggests this
is that for virtually any U. S. industry or aggregate, production is more variable

than demand (Blinder (1981, 1986a], Blanchard (1983]).' This is logically
inconsistent with a simple production smoothing model with increasing production and
inventory costs, because such a model argues that the sole reason to hold

inventories is to smooth production relative to demand (West (1986]). It is also
empirically inconsistent with more complex production smoothing models that allow
for accelerator effects and for quadratic costs of changing production, since these
additional complexities do not appear to explain the excess variability (West
(1986]).

Cost shocks, however, rationalize the excess production variability quite

naturally. This is most easily seen in an extreme case when demand is constant

2

(there are no demand

shocks).

Production will still vary as costs vary, since

production will be high (low) when costs are low (high), with procyclical adjustment
of inventories covering the gap between production and sales. Production will
therefore be more variable than sales.

Partly

because cost shocks provide a simple explanation of the excess

variability of production, recent inventory research has emphasized the potential
role of cost shocks (e.g., Blinder (l986b], Maccini and Rossana (1984], Miron and
Zeldes

less

[1987]). It appears, however, that there is as

yet no direct evidence, still

a consensus, on how important cost shocks are relative to demand shocks.

Christiano and Eichenbaum (1987], for example, find the excess variability of
production suggestive of a predominant role for coat shocks, while Blinder [1986a]
constructs an example in which the excess variability is consistent with a very

small role. As stated above, one aim of this paper is to quantify the relative
importance of cost and demand shocks as determinants of aggregate inventories.
Simultaneously, the paper

studies how these shocks

interact to determine GNP.

Recent work in real business cycles has argued that most of the movements in GNP can

be explained by fluctuations in costs. Prescott [1986a], for example, suggests that
75 percent of these movements are cost related. Consistent with this, two very
recent vector autoregressive (VAR) studies have found that well over half of the
variance of GNP forecasts more than twelve quarters ahead is due to permanent rather
than transitory shocks (Blanchard and Quah [1988], King et al. (1987]); both studies
interpret permanent shocks as cost rather than demand related, while acknowledging

that other interpretations are possible. By contrast, an earlier VAR study
(Blanchard and Watson (1986]) found that demand shocks are the primary source of GNP
fluctuations, as did a recent study by Fair tl988].

The present paper uses comovements of inventories and GNP to help determine the

sources of fluctuations in GNP. Given the importance of movements of inventory

3

turning points (Blinder (19811, Blinder and I4oltz-Eakin (1986]).

this seems likely to contain significant information about the sources of U. S.

business cycles. The basic intuition is suggested by a simple production smoothing
model, where

the

only cost terms are ones quadratic in the level of production and

inventories: demand shocks will tend to cause inventories to move countercyclically,
cost shocks will tend to cause them to move procyclically.
Since it

is

well known that inventory movements are procyclical (Summers

(1981]), this simple model would, of course, attribute much of the movement in GNP

and inventories to cost shocks. The model used, however, allows for a target
inventory-sales ratio (as does, e.g., Blanchard (19831, Ramey (19881 and West

(1986]). This can induce procyclical movements in inventories in response to demand
shocks, and no simple mapping between shocks and comovements is expected to obtain.
But estimation of the parameter that determines the target inventory-sales ratio,
together with the other parameters of the model, allows one to disentangle movements

due to cost from those due to demand shocks. These parameters may be computed from
the estimates of a bivariate VAR in inventories and GNP. The VAR is estimated on
quarterly data, 1947-1986, for both stationary and unit root specifications.
The point estimates suggest that cost shocks are the predominant source of

fluctuations in inventories. They are largely though not exclusively the reason
that GNP is more variable than final sales; some excess variability appears to be

due as well to increasing returns in production. Cost and demand shocks are of
roughly equal importance in GNP fluctuations. Cost shocks are especially important
for inventories at relatively long horizons, for GNP at short horizons. Over 90
percent of the variance of inventory forecasts 20 quarters ahead is due to cost

shocks. The comparable figure for CNP is about 40 to 60 percent.
CNP and inventories both display hump shaped responses to both demand and cost

shocks, with the peak affect occurring about four quarters out. When the shocks are

new steady states are essentially achieved in about ten

the usual reasons, however, these results should be

interpreted with

caution: tests of overidentifying restrictions strongly reject the model (as in
Christiano and Eichenbaum (1987], for example), and confidence intervals are rather
large (as in Blanchard and Quab [1988], for example). In connection with the latter
point, it should be noted that the estimates are quite sensitive to the parameter

that determines the target inventory-sales ratio. The point estimate of the
relevant parameter is lower than that obtained in some previous studies (e.g.,

Blanchard [1983], Ramey (1988], West [19861). When this parameter is constrained to
a higher value consistent with these previous studies, much less--only about 10 per
cent--of the movement in GNP over 20 quarters ahead is attributed to cost shocks.

Section II describes the model. Section III presents empirical results.
Section IV concludes. An appendix has some technical details, with an additional
appendix available on request from the author containing additional results and
details not of central importance.

II. Model
The basic model is a generalization of the linear-quadratic inventory models
in, for example, Blinder (1982], Blanchard (1983), Beisley [1969], and West [1986],

and was suggested by Sargent (1979, ch. XVI]. A similar model was developed
independently by Christiano and Eichenbaum [l987]

To focus on interactions between

inventories and output fluctuations, it is assumed that storage in inventories is

the only means of smoothing production or demand in response to shocks. Demand is
linear (the area under the demand curve is quadratic). Production and storage costs
also are

quadratic.

(8) says that one can increase this value neither by selling one fewer unit

producing and selling one extra unit this period.
Equation (8) was derived under the assumption that the product market is

competitive. Suppose instead that a single firm

is

a monopolist, as in Blinder

[1982]. It is straightforward to verify that (8) still holds, i.e., the

The aim of this paper is to use (11) to determine how cost and demand shocks
interact to determine inventories, production and sales. This requires estimates of

and F. Given FF', the first two are easily obtained from (11) by

linear regressions; calculating F$F' entails some work (see below and the

appendix). Given F, G may be diagonalized by multiplying it by F1. One may then

10

apply standard VAR-techniques to compute impulse response functions and variance
decompositions.

A basic check on the plausibility of the results is the pattern of impulse

responses. While complicated and perhaps counterintuitive dynamics are possiblt
(Blinder [l986a]), intuition suggests that the initial impact of a cost shock will

be to cause inventories, production and sales to fall, with a negative long run
impact as well when there are unit roots. One expects the initial impact of a
demand shock to cause production and sales to rise, with the effect on inventories
indeterminate: production smoothing will tend to make the effect negative, g55>O in

equation (2) will tend to make the effect positive (see also Blinder [1986a]). When
there are unit roots (*d'4e1)'

the long run impact of a demand shock on production

and sales is positive, on inventories indeterminate (again because of conflicting

forces from production smoothing and g>0).
This section cloaes with an overview of the procedure used to identify the

shocks, and may be skipped without loss of continuity. The first step is to obtain
an estimate of F4F', which is used construct the right and left hand aide variables

in (11). Estimation of FIF' when • and 0d

appendix. Consider instead when Ø and *d are imposed a priori. This was true,

one of the specifications estimated below. Then t—F'F1—I, the

shocks follow uncorrelated random walks, and equation (11) is just AY—fltY..1+V.

the first order conditions unchanged, apart from a rescaling of the

impulse responses to a one standard deviation shock, however, are invariant to

choice of normalization.
It should be noted that whether or not

is known a priori this is not the

usual procedure for orthogonalizing vector autoregressive residuals (e.g.,

Haltiwanger and Maccini [19871), and issues such as sensitivity of results to
orderings of variables are not relevant. The basic algebraic reason for this is
that

Emoirical Results

A. Data and Estimation Technique
The data were real (1982 dollars), quarterly, seasonally adjusted, and
expressed at annual rates, 1947:1 to 1986:4. Figures for ON?, final sales (demand)
and inventory investment were obtained from CITIBASE files 0NP82, CNS82 and GV82.
The implied series for inventories was obtained by setting the 1982:1 figure to
match the corresponding entry in the CITIBASE file for real inventories, GL82, and
then using the series for inventory investment (GV82) to compute the level in other
quarters.

The first step in the empirical work was to model deterministic and stochastic

trends. Regressions of log levels of the data on a constant and time trend yielded
estimated growth rates of 0.786 per cent per quarter for inventories, 0.828 percent
for production; when inventories and GNP were constrained to have a common

12

deterministic growth rate, the figure was 0.807 percent per quarter. This suggested
that it. is reasonable to model the two variables as having a common deterministic
trend, and, indeed, neither asymptotic nor Monte Carlo tests could reject the null

of a common deterministic trend. Details on these tests, as well as on the
consistency of geometric growth with the model, are in the additional appendix
available on request. The data used in all the estimation below therefore are data
"scaled" by this common deterministic trend, i.e. ,

the

1982 data just described

divided by (10Ø8Ø7)t• The mean values for scaled inventories, CNP and sales were
1,017, 1,106 and 1,099 billion 1982 dollars. See Figure I for a plot of the scaled
data.

All the inference reported below is conditional on the estimated growth rate of
0.807 percent per quarter and, except for the results in Tables I and II below, on

an imposed discount rate b—0.98 as well. Related work (West [1986)) and some tests
described in a footnote suggest that the empirical results are not likely to be
sensitive to even large errors in the estimate of this deterministic trend, or to
the exact choice of discount rate.0
The Said and Dickey [1984) test for a unit root in the scaled data does not
reject the null of a unit root in either GNP or inventories at even the ten percent
level, for either 4 lags (t-statistic for H0: coefficient on lagged dependent
variable—l is -1.96 for GNP, -1.20 for inventories) or 12 lags (t-statistic —

-1.62

for CNP, -1.16 for inventories), using either the asymptotic or Monte Carlo levels

in Schwert [1987]. This suggested the importance of a differenced (—d—l)
specification. On the other hand, extreme serial correlation of GNP and inventories
is consistent with a stationary model as well, with the persistence coming from

and d less than but near unity. This suggests the plausibility of an undifferenced
specification as well. A cointegrated specification seemed of secondary interest
because the null of no cointegration of GNP and inventories was not rejected at even

13

the ten per cent level using the Engle and Granger [1987] CRDW test, when either GNP
was regressed on inventories (Durbin-Watson —

0.042).

In all three specifications, confidence intervals for various estimates were

bootstripped (Efron [1982], Freedman (l984, Runkle [1987]), using one thousand
repetitions.° For each of the one thousand repetitions: (a)a time series of Y was
generated recursively using the estimated II and FF', and sampling the estimated
residuals with replacement; (b)equation (11) was reestimated (holding F$F' fixed),

to get another U. Inference was thus conditional on the estimated or imposed

serial

correlation matrix F4F' (and, as noted above, on the value of the discount

rate b and the estimated growth rate).

Impulse responses and variance decompositions over various finite horizons were

calculated in th. standard way, using the RATS computer program. The results also
report variance decompositions at an infinite horizon, computed simply as the limit
of the finite horizon variance decompositions.
A specialization of the model that involves a simple form of costs has simple

implications for the relative variabilities of GNP and final sales. Suppose in

Estimates of the reduced form, of cost and demand parameters, of impulse
response functions, of production and sales variability, and of variance

decompositions will be discussed in turn. Table II has estimates of the reduced
form (10), where fl—[s. (Constant terms were included in all the regressions, but

15

The results of three disgnostic tests sre reported in columns (6) to (8). The
Q ststistics in columns (6) and (7) cannot reject the null of no serial correlation
in the residuals at the 5 per cent level, though they do reject at the 10 percent

level for the inventory equation all three specifications. Column (8) reports
maximum likelihood tests of the null of a lag length of one versus a lag length of

two (after differencing or quasi-differencing by Ftr'). These reject the null of a
lag length of one quite strongly. For the stationary specifications, tests of an
unrestricted lag length of two, in levels, versus the restricted second order VAR
implied by (11) also reject the null at the .05 level (not reported in the Table)
The rejection of the overidentifying restrictions reported in column (8)
suggests that this model is too simple to fully characterize the data.
Qualitatively similar results obtain, however, when a more complicated model that

implies a longer length VAR is used (see section C below). Since the present model
is simpler to interpret, and since the parameter estimates and impulse response
functions are for the most part quite plausible (see below), I will focus on this
simple model.

Cost and demand parameters are reported in Table III, with the normalization as

stated in the Table. Most parameters are correctly signed. The demand curve slope
g05, the inventory cost g05 and the cost of adjustment gIQ are all fairly precisely

estimated, and are consistent with those for the automobile industry (Blanchard

[1983]) and for two digit nondurables manufacturers (West [1986]). The target level
parameter ge is, however, incorrectly signed, although the 95 percent confidence
interval is so large that it includes values such aa .4 and .7 that are consistent
with Blanchard [1983], Ramey [1988] and West [1986] .

I

therefore interpret this as

a noisy and imprecise sample estimate of a population parameter that is positive

(though perhaps small).7 Particularly interesting are the eatimatea of the

quadratic production coat g. As in Blanchard [1983] this coat is insignificantly

16

different from zero and constant returns to scale cannot be rejected. As in Ramey
[1988], however, the point estimates are negative, implying a tendency to bunch
production.

Figures II and III plot the response to one standard deviation cost and demand

shocks for the .-4.—O.949 specification. Figures IV and V do the same for

#e1.0.

(To conserve space, plots for O.969, —O.997 are not presented, but

any differences from d°•949 are noted below.) The signs of the shocks are as
in equations (1) and (2): a positive cost shock raises costs, a positive demand

shock raises demand. The units on the vertical axis are billions of 1982 dollars.
Note that the vertical scale in Figure III is slightly more compact than in the
other three figures, and that the horizontal scales are different for the

cd°949

and

specifications.

In response to a positive stationary cost shock (Figure II), GNP, inventories

and final sales all fall initially, then rise back to the initial steady state. The
smoothing role of inventories is illustrated by the sharper initial fall of GNP than
demand, in response to the increase in costs; without inventories, this sharper fall

would not be possible. The smoothing pattern appears to make GNP more variable than
sales, as is expected in simplified versions of the model in the presence of cost
shocks alone.

The GNP and sales responses to a stationary demand shock, in Figure III, are

familiar hump-shaped ones. As in Blanchard and Quah [1988], the peak response
occurs at about four quarters. Inventories are initially drawn down, thereby

buffering GNP from the shock. They are then built up, accumulating above the
steady state level before falling back down. The pattern is similar to Haltiwanger
and Maccini's [19871 estimates of the response of finished goods inventories to new

orders shocks. The smoothing by inventories appears to make GNP more variable than
demand. This is inconsistent with the standard production smoothing model with g0Q

17

positive, but is unsurprising given that the estimated g is negative.9
In response to a positive random walk cost shock (Figure IV), inventories,

demand and CNP all fall. Once again, inventories perform their smoothing role,
allowing demand to fall less than GNP. The decline in both inventories and final
sales is slmost monotonic; GNP displays a hump shape (as in Blanchard and Quah
[1988] and King et al. [1987]). The new steady state is essentially obtained in
about two years, again as in Blanchard and Qush (1988] snd King et al. [1987]. (The
similarity of the steady state changes in final sales and GNP results because
inventory investment (the first difference of inventories) is assumed stationary.)

In response to a positive random walk demand shock (Figure V), inventories are
drawn down, demand and GNP rise. Some smoothing is apparent initially, although GNP
quickly rises past demand. Inventories show a hump shape; the return back towards
the initial level again suggests a target level. The steady state is again reached
in about two years.

Table IV reports the relative variability of GNP and final sales, using the

*c4C&949 and *c*dl specifications. As is well known (Blinder [1981]), the
variance of CNP exceeds that of final sales (line 1, column 2). The appropriate
inequality holds as well when unit roots are assumed present (line 1, column 1).
The impression from the Figures that GNP is more variables than sales, in response
to either cost or demand shocks, is borne out by the relevant point estimates (lines
2 and 3), though the excess variability is statistically insignificant at the 95
percent level when there are demand shocks only (line 2).
Table IV suggests an explanation of the seeming contradiction between the
Blinder [1982] version of the production smoothing model and the fact that CNP is

more variable than final sales. The bulk of the explanation is that cost shocks are
important. But even in the absence of cost shocks, CNP would possibly continue to
be more variable. This excess variability appears to be attributable at least in

18

part to a small tendency to bunch production (i.e., to the small negative value of

if the Table IV figures are recalculated for the #c'4C"° specification under
the counterfactual assumption that g—O (constant rather than increasing returns to
scale), with all other parsmeters held constant, the entry in line (2) for just
demand shocks falls to 0.994.

Table V has variance decompositions. In all three specifications, the variance
of inventories is largely attributable to cost disturbances. This is eapecially
true at relatively long horizons. The point estimates suggest that over 90 per cent
of the variance is attributable to coat shocks at horizons of 4 quarters or more,
the confidence intervals that it is unlikely that less than half the variance is due

to cost shocks. This dominance of cost shocks is consistent with the marked
procyclicality of inventory stocks (see Figure I), and is perhaps unsurprising given

that the estimates of the accelerator parameter g were negative.
All three specifications attribute to coat shocks about 40 to 60 per cent of
the variability of GNP at horizons of about 20 quarters. At longer horizons,
however, there are marked differences between the two specifications that impose

c"#d (columns (1) and (2)) and the one that does not (column (3)). When dc' the
infinite horizon figure is still about 40 to 60 per cent, but for #—0.967,

°.996

the figure is about only a little above 10 per cent. A comparison of

columns (2) and (3) indicate that this is an artifact of the alightly higher point

estimate of #5: if #—I,

the contribution of coat ahocka at an infinite

horizon would of course be zero. Here, instead, #d is slightly less than one, ao
the contribution of cost shocks at that horizon is not exactly zero.t° I am
therefore inclined to downplay the infinite horizon decompoaitiona in column (3).
In this connection, the reader should recall that the confidence intervals are
conditional on the eatimatea of

and

so the upper bound of 34.9 in the

infinite horizon confidence interval in column (3) probably is consistent with a

19

point estimate in the 40 to 60 range.

This 40 to 60 per cent range is bracketed by the somewhat higher estimates in
&lanchard and Quah (1988] and King et al. [1987], and the somewhat lower estimates

in 3lanchard and Watson (1986] and Fair [1988]." A possible reconciliation with
the two papers that find higher estimates is that permanent shocks, tentatively
linked in those papers to cost rather than demand, are in fact partly demand
related: in the present context, at least, nothing in the model or results argues
for allowing for cost but not demand shocks to be permanent.

A possible reconciliation with the three papers that find a smaller role for
costs is suggested by the only one of the papers that has an inventory equation,

Fair [1988]. Fair uses a standard flexible accelerator/production smoothing model.
Desired inventories are proportional to sales; actual inventories adjust only

partially toward the desired level (Fair [1984, ppl3l-l32)). In Fair [1988) the
shock to the inventory equation is interpreted as one of the components of the

aggregate demand shock. In the present paper, however, the shock to the inventory
equation in both (8) and (10) depends on cost as wall as demand. Inventory
investment therefore responds to cost shocks. The same plausibly applies to other
types of business investment. Insofar as the shocks to the aggregate demand curve
in Blanchard and Watson [1986) are due to business investment, some of the GNP
variability that those papers attribute to aggregate demand shocks might more

properly be attributed to aggregate cost shocks. In any case, whether or not I am
correct in arguing that shocks to investment equations plausibly reflect cost as
well as demand, my argument does suggest why I find a more important role for cost

shocks than do and Blanchard and Watson [1986) and Fair (1988]. Whether this
argument is persuasive of course will require further research.
To return to Table V: Cost shocks are less important for CNP as the forecast

horizon increases. This pattern held quite rigidly. Although not reported in Table

20

V, the fraction of CNF

variability attributable

to cost shocks declined

monotonically as the horizon increased. Evidently, demand shocks are estimated to
have increasing real effects for GNP, with inventories serving as a buffer. This is
illustrated in the impulse responses. In both specifications, CNP responses to cost
shocks show an earlier peak and a quicker approach to the steady state.

The decreasing importance of demand shocks is consistent with Maccini and
Haltiwanger [1987] , who report an analogous tendency for shocks to new orders to

account for an increasing fraction of the variance of manufacturing inventories as

the forecast horizon increases. The contradictory Zlanchard and Quah [1988] and
King et al. (1987] result that cost shocks are increasingly important as the horizon
increasea again potentially can be reconciled with Table V if permanent disturbances
are demand as well as cost related.
Finally, fluctuations in final sales appear to be attributable in roughly equal
(I again discount the results in column (3), for

shares to coat and demand shocks.

the reasons given above.) There does not appear to be a marked tendency for cost
shocks to be particularly important at any particular horizon. (Once again, for the
differenced specification, the similarity of the infinite horizon decompositions for
CNP and sales results because inventory investment is stationary.)
C. Additional Emoirical Results
As a check on the preceding results, two

additional

sets of estimates were

obtained. For simplicity, I imposed *cdl in both, and did not compute any
confidence intervals. The first set of estimates was already mentioned in the
discussion of diagnostic tests, and used a more complicated model that implied a

longer length VAR. Equation (2)'s cost function was expanded to:

(13) Ct — go0Q2 + g10AQ2

+ g55(H.1-gS)2 + 2Ut(hHt+Qt)

+ gaEaQ

+

g2H2 + gQ5.

+

21

The four additional terms are suggested by Eichenbaum [1984]. With cd1' this
can be shown to lead to an exactly identified second order VAR in
Diagnostic tests on the OLS estimates of this second order VAR: For the tll

equation, Q(36) for the residual was 32.81 (p-value —

Q(36)—28.37 (p-value —

0.82);

0.62);

for the

equation,

2(4) for lags—2 against lags—3 (second order against

third order VAR) yields 4.33 (p-value—0.36).

Point estimates for the g are given in Table VIA. Of the five parameters
present in the model used above, four fall within the 95 percent confidence
intervals in line 1 of Table III (the exception is gjQ, which is a little larger

than one would expect from the Table III confidence interval). Most of the four
additional parameters are small relative to the original parameters, with three of

the four (g, g, g) having negative signs. The interpretation of these negative
signs is unclear. Perhaps this suggests a tendency to bunch inventory holdings as

well as production. The entries corresponding to the & line in Table V are
reported in Table VIB. As may be seen, they are consistent with the Table V
entries.

I conclude that even though the model in section B was, as usual, rejected by
tests of overidentifying restrictions, substantively different results are unlikely
to be produced by extensions to models that are complicated and more difficult to
interpret, but unrejected.

A second set of additional estimates considered the implications of the

imprecise estimates of the accelerator parameter g. In this set, g was fixed at
0.68 instead of its estimated value of -

.04;

.68 is the upper bound of the 95

percent confidence interval in line (1) of Table III, and is consistent with the

estimates of some earlier studies (Blanchard [1983], West [1986]). Holding the

other g parameters fixed at the values reported in Table III, I then solved for

22

the reduced form and used thia in all aubaequent calculations.

One would expect the higher value of g to lead to a less important role for
cost shocks, since more of the procyclical movement of inventories will be

attributed to movements in demand. Indeed, with the other g parameters held fixed
at the values reported in Table III, the implied infinite horizon fraction of the
variance of inventories, GNP and sales due to cost shocks falls, to 66, 9 and 9.

See Table VII. The estimates in Table V, then, are sufficiently imprecise that

fixing g at a plausible value that is rather different from its estimated value
results in a variance decomposition that is rather different, and more consistent
with some earlier studies (e.g., Fair [1988,p2321 who finds that supply shocks
account for 7 percent of the variance of the eight quarter shead forecast error in

GNP).

IV. Conclusions
Fluctuations in aggregate inventories in the postwar U.S. appear to be due more

to fluctuations in cost than in demand. Despite some long standing difficulties in
linking movements in inventories to those in costs (a recent example is Miron and
Zeldes [1987]), the implication is that future inventory research should emphasize

the role of costs. Fluctuations in CNP appear to be due in roughly equal
proportions to fluctuations in cost and demand. The point estimates are, however,
noisy. With a different, and plausible, value for the parameter that determines a
target inventory-sales ratio, cost shocks are less important than demand shocks for
CNP fluctuations.

Footnotes

1. An

exception

is production to order manufacturing, when demand is

measured by orders rather than sales (West (1988]).

2. Readers who prefer the monopolist interpretation should note that under

that interpretation the parammter estimate called g is instead an estimate of

.5g. In a related context, Eichenbaum (1984] states that an oligopolistic
structure results in an observationally equivalent equilibrium, provided
individual firms follow symmetric open ioop Nash strategies.
3. Necessary conditions for (8) and (10) to be the optimal solution to the
model include (l)A0 is positive definite (the Legendre-Clebsch condition for

optimality [Stengel, l986,p2l3]); (2)the two

smaller

of the four roots to

bAiz1+Ao+AjzI_0 are strictly less than b"2 in modulus. These conditions are

guaranteed to hold if g, g. g0, gjq > 0. See Hansen and Sargent [1981]. I
thank Tryphon Kollintzas for clarifying this point.

4. Actually, impulse response functions are invariant only up to a sign
change.

S. For the

specification described below, I calculated the infinite

horizon variance decompositions described in the next paragraph, for data scaled

by (1012)t — [1 +

(l.5)x(.008)]t

and (1•004)t — (1 + (.5)x(.008)]t. None of

these estimates were more than four percentage points different than the figures

reported in Table V below. See West (1986] on the insensitivity of results to
exact choice of b.

6. For the differenced specification, asymptotic standard errors were also
calculated for some of the parameter estimates, in a fashion similar to that

described in West [1988]. The results were about the same.
7. While

g<0

is not sensible, this model still generates a positive level

of inventories (see Schutte [1983]). In the underlying model that allows for
deterministic growth in inventories and production, which is described in detail
in the additional appendix available on request, the quadratic costs in (2) are

interpreted as costs around a minimum point that grows over time. This growth

can lead to positive inventory levels even if g is negative (or, more
plausibly, zero).

8. The estimated value of g is small enough relative to the other
parameters that the conditions noted in footnote 3 are met. It should be
emphasized that the conditions in that footnote are necessary but not sufficient.
James Hamilton has pointed out to me that these conditions therefore do not
establish that the point estimates are consistent with (8) and (10)
characterizing the optimal policy.

9. For —0.969, #d°.997' the response to a cost shock is quite similar to
that in Figure II, but the response to a demand is somewhat different from Figure
III, in that (a)even after 80 quarters, no return to the steady state is obvious
(this of course results since *d

is

so near unity), and (b)after initially

falling, inventories rise up above the steady state before finally falling back
towards the steady state.

10. The ""

entry

for H in column 3 indicates that this argument does not

yet apply to inventories with #d.996;
some #d

arbitrarily near

it would of course eventually apply for

unity.

11. Fair [1988] only calculates decompositions up to eight quarters out;
these, too, attribute a much lower figure to costs than does Table V.
12. In defense of the present paper, it should be noted that these estimates
do not seem to be any less precise than those in Blanchard snd Quah [1988] or

King et si. (1987]. Incidentally, for the #c4d"1

specification,

plots of the

eight quarter ahead forecast error in GNP (as in Blsnchard and Watson [1986])
indicated that both the cost and demand shocks tended to be negative in
contractions, positive in expansions, with no noticeable tendency for cycles to

be demand or cost driven. When g was fixed at .68, the same plot indicated
that all cycles were demand driven (including, perhaps implausibly, the 1973-75
recession).

Tests for a common deterministic trend in 0 and H

For the stationary specification, an asymptotic test of whether the two
unconstrained growth rates of .786 and .828 percent are significantly

different from one another was performed. This did not reject the null of a
common growth rate at conventional significance levels (t-statistic less than
1.43, using either fifth, tenth, or fifteenth order Newey and West (1987)

corrections).

For the nonstationary specification, a bootstrap test of the

null of one deterministic and of the null of two stochastic trends was

performed. The residuals for the AR(l) first difference specification were
sampled with replacement, the scaled data were generated according to the
estimated VAR parameters, and unscaled data were constructed using the

estimated common growth rate of .807 percent. For each sample, I estimated
and saved (a)the absolute value of the difference between the estimated growth
rates of (i)inventories and (ii)CNP, and (b)the Durbin Watson of the
regression of scaled inventories on scaled GNP, with an estimated common
growth rate used for scaling.

Fewer than 60 percent of the estimates of the separate growth rates were
less than .042 (—.828- .786) percent apart. The null of a common deterministic

trend thus cannot be rejected. In addition, fewer than 50 percent of the
Durbin-Watson statistics from the regression of scaled inventories on scaled

GNP were smaller than .042, the figure for the actual data. Thus, the null of
two stochastic trends cannot be rejected.
