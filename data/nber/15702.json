    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses the sequence of government budget constraints to motivate estimates of interest payments on the U.S. Federal government debt.  We explain why our estimates differ conceptually and quantitatively from those  reported by the U.S. government. We use our estimates to account for contributions to the evolution of the debt to GDP ratio made by  inflation,  growth, and nominal returns paid on debts of different maturities.\n\n",
