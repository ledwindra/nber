    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the impact of the aging demographic structure of the U.S. on its funded private pension system.  A 75-year outlook is produced for the pension system corresponding to the 75-year forecast of the Social Security system.  The primary result is that the pension system will cease being a source of national saving in the third decade of the next century.  The paper speculates about the impact this may have on asset prices.\n\n",
