Accumulation of Property By Southern Blacks Before World War I:

Comment and Further Evidence
ABSTRACT

The

pace and pattern of wealth accumulation by Southern blacks in the

period before World war I is of central importance to the historical evolution
of black/white income differences. This paper extends recent work by Robert
Higgs, who used data on assessed wealth for Georgia to study the temporal and
cross—sectional variation in black wealth accumulation during the post—bellum

era. Using
principal

similar data for five additional states, I show that

one of Higgs'

conclusions——measured by tax assessments, blacks accumulated wealth

more rapidly than whites——is a general finding, but that the cross—sectional
determinants of black wealth appear to have varied markedly across states.
Issues of assessment ratio bias are also considered, and using data for one
state, I demonstrate that failure to account for intrastate and race differences
in assessment ratios may bias the cross—sectional findings and significantly
overstate the

true

relative (black/white) growth rate of black wealth.

The pace and pattern of wealth accumulation among Southern blacks from
emancipation to World War I is of central importance to the historical

evolution of black/white income differences. In a recent paper in this
Review, Robert Higgs uses Georgia tax assessment records to show that blacks
accumulated property more rapidly than whites during this period, subject to

short—run fluctuations in cotton income. Cross—sectional regressions reveal
that black wealth varied inversely with illiteracy, the price of land, and the
tenancy rate; positively with cotton cultivation, the presence of plantation
agriculture, and population density; but was insignificantly affected by

racial composition. As Higgs points out (p. 735), "these findings call into
question the traditional interpretation of the role played by the plantation—
cotton—black belt complex,' and underscore the long—run effects of illiteracy
and educational discrimination on black economic progress.

This comment extends Higgs' findings in two directions. First, race—
specific data on assessed wealth are examined for five additional states.
Analysis of these data reveals that the Georgia time—series pattern of rapid
growth of black assessed wealth, absolutely and relative to white assessed
wealth, is a more general finding, but that cross—sectional regressions of
black assessed wealth yield only limited conclusions once interstate

comparisons are made. Second, because the data used here and in Higgs' study
are assessed and not true wealth, the sensitivity of the results to cross—
sectional and temporal variation in assessment practices is an important

issue. Evidence for one state demonstrates that failure to control for
intrastate variation in assessment ratios may bias the cross—sectional
results, and that blacks faced higher average assessment ratios than whites.
Furthermore, preliminary upper bound calculations suggest that adjusting for
changes in relative (black/white) assessment ratios may significantly reduce

—1—

the relative rate of growth of black wealth, although the substantive
conclusion —

that

black accumulated wealth more rapidly than whites —

still

holds.

Early in his paper, Higgs (p. 726) refers to Georgia as "the only state
with a long and highly disaggregated record of race—specific property

holdings." Beginning in the late 19th century, however, and continuing beyond
1915 (the final year of Higg's study), race—specific figures on assessed
wealth similar to the Georgia data are available for Louisiana, North

Carolina, and Virginia. In addition, the Kentucky auditor's reports contain
race—specific data from 1866 to 1885, and race—specific figures for Arkansas
from 1895 to 1911 can be computed from the data on total assessed wealth and
the black share of property tax payments given in its auditor's reports.
Figure 1 [analogous to Higg's Figure 1 (p. 729)] charts the total
assessed value of property (in 1910—14 dollars) held by blacks in each state
for the years data are available (or can be estimated) to 1915, and Table 1
gives race—specific per capita estimates for the census and other years in

this time interval,2 A defect of the Louisiana records is the absence of
race—specific data for New Orleans; the figures in brackets adjust for this
omission, based on the assumption that the black/white ratio of per capita
wealth in New Orleans was identical to the ratio prevailing elsewhere in the

state.3 The Arkansas estimates should also be viewed with some caution as
they are sensitive to the time—series pattern of property tax delinquencies,
although the fluctuations are similar in magnitude to those observed in the
other states.

The data reveal that, despite socioeconomic and political differences
across regions, blacks in every state experienced rapid growth in total
assessed wealth, and with the exception of Louisiana, in per capita terms,

—2—

absolutely and relative to white assessed wealth. Other than a trough in the
late 1870s, the Kentucky data suggest that substantial progress was made in

the immediate post—emancipation period. In contrast to Georgia and Louisiana,
blacks in Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia continued to augment their
per capita wealth in the 1890s, despite a common downturn late in the

decade. With the striking exception of Louisiana, per capita black wealth
increased rapidly after 1900, and the black/white ratio of per capita wealth

continued to rise. The boll weevil infestation wreaked havoc on Louisiana's
cotton crop very early in the century (by 1906), and the close correlation
between cotton income and black wealth in Georgia suggests that a similar

explanation might apply to the Pelican state. This hypothesis Is confirmed by
the following regression (absolute value of t—statistics in parentheses):

LBW = — 0.06 + 0.87 LBW(—1) + 0.03 CY(—1) — 0.03 YDIJN
(1.19) (8.85)

(2.46)

(0.08)

N=21

where LBW is the log of total black wealth In Louisiana (1910—14 dollars), LRW
(—1) is LBW once lagged, CY(—l) is total cotton Income in Louisiana (gross
producer revenues in millions of 1910—14 dollars) once lagged, and Y1DUM is a

dummy for observations after 1906. If cotton income is excluded, the
coefficient of YDUK is —0.09, significant at the 1% level. In sum, these
additional data would tend to support one of Higg's principal conclusions——
that Southern blacks rapidly accumulated wealth during the post—bellum period,
and succeeded in closing the gap with white wealth in relative terms.
Table 2 reports cross—sectional, county—level regressions of per capita

—3—

assessed wealth and wealth per adult male, for Arkansas, Louisiana, North

Carolina, and Virginia, in 1910. The regression specification is identical to

Hlggs (p. 734) with three exceptions. First, the plantation county dummy
(PLANTATION) and the share of improved acreage devoted to cotton (COT/IMPAC)
were excluded from the Virginia regressions because of an insufficient number
of plantation counties (two), and because cotton was a minor crop in

Virginia. Second, preliminary analysis revealed that regressions of per
capita wealth in Louisiana, and wealth per adult male in Arkansas, were

statistically insignificant. As an alternate control for the age and sex
composition of the population, the ratio of black adult males to the total
black population (BM21/BPOP) was Included in the per capita wealth regressions
for these states.

Third, an estimate of the average assessment ratio on real estate and

personal property (ASR) is added to two of the Virginia regressions.5 The
logic here is simple: assessed wealth is the product of the assessment ratio
and the true value of wealth, and the regression coefficients may confound the

effects of the independent variables on these two components. This problem is
potentially serious in cross—sectional analyses of assessed wealth, because

assessment ratios varied greatly from county to county. By controlling for
the assessment ratio, biases can be identified by examining the effects on the

other regression coefficients. Finally, I follow Higgs by averaging the
dependent variables over the years 1909 to 1911, by excluding counties with
black populations less than 1,000, and by weighting each observation by the
square root of the relevant population size.

In controlling for heteroscedasticlty in the Georgia data, Higgs (Table
3, p. 735) included a constant term and the GLS weight in his cross—sectional
regressions only the latter is appropriate (G.S. Maddala, p. 268; Potluri Rao

—4—

and Roger Miller, p. 121). Corrected estimates for Georgia appear in Table

2. Fortunately, the corrected coefficients do not differ from those reported
by Higgs in sign or statistical significance, with the exception of the black
population share (BPOP/POP), which reverses sign, but remains statistically

Insignificant.6 The adjusted R's, much lower than those reported by Higgs (p.
735), refer to the proportion of variance explained by applying the GLS
coefficients to the unweighted data.
Inspection of Table 2 reveals that the signs and magnitudes of the
coefficients and their associated significance levels vary widely across

states, and few, if any, generalizations are possible. If, in light of the
insignificant regressions noted above, the Louisiana and Arkansas data are
rejected as insufficiently reliable, and attention restricted to the results
for North Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia, some limited conclusions may be

drawn. Specifically, high land values clearly retarded black wealth
accumulation, as did illiteracy and tenancy (in two of three states), and
there is no evidence that an increase in the proportion black or the cotton
share significantly reduced black wealth.
Equations (8) and (10) demonstrate that controlling for the assessment
ratio eliminates the positive effects of population density and racial
composition on black wealth in Virginia, and increases the negative effect of

illiteracy. This suggests that assessment ratios in Virginia were higher in
heavily black counties, urban areas, and counties where the black illiteracy

rate was high. These hypotheses are confirmed in the following regression
(absolute value of t—statistIcs in parentheses):

ASR = 0.028 + 0.19 BPOP/POP +

N—lOl

0.002 POP/SQMI + 0.0015 BPIOILLIT
(7.33)

(1.31)

Higher assessment ratios in cities are not very suprising, but the positive

association with percent black and black illiteracy seems peculiar. An early
20th century study by the economist Tipton Ray Snavely, based on data
collected by the Virginia Tax Commission (see footnote 5) provides some

clues. Snavely discovered that assessment ratios on real estate in Virginia
varied Inversely with the sales price of property; holding constant sales
price, black property was assessed at higher ratios than white property,

except in two valuation classes (see Table 3). This suggests that the higher
assessment ratios In the Virginia black belt may be partly due to racial
composition, although varifythg this conjecture would require that Snavely's
data be disaggregated by race at the county level, which cannot be done from

published sources. The positive association between illiteracy and the
assessment ratio, although insignIficant, may reflect the political nature of
the assessment process, a negative relationship between true wealth and
illiteracy, and the relative ease of determining the market value of small

holdings of land. "The true value...of small and little—improved holdings,"
wrote the authors of the Virginia Tax Commission's Report, (p. 10) "is much

easier to ascertain than Is that of the rich man's estate. The poor man,
furthermore, usually has for his protection little influence, either personal

or political. Finally, the poor man Is ignorant of the means of correcting an
unfair assessment or finds he cannot afford it."
A specific implication of this discussion is that ignoring the variation
In assessment practices would lead to the erroneous inference that Virginia
blacks who inhabited black belt counties or cities were significantly more

successful In accumulating property. Whether similar cross—sectional biases

are present in the other states is unclear. Hlggs tested the cross—sectional

—6—

reliability of the Georgia data by examining the fit (and outliers) of a
regression of the per—acre value of farm real estate reported by black farm
owners in the 1910 Census of Agriculture on the per—acre assessed value of

farm real estate listed by black tax—payers in 1910. By this method the North
Carolina data would be judged reliable (this test cannot be performed for
Arkansas or Louisiana), as the fit of the regression was similar to the

Georgia case.7 Alternatively, Higgs' test implicitly defines the assessment
ratio on black farm real estate to be the ratio of the per—acre assessed value

and the per—acre census value. Adding this variable to the North Carolina and

Georgia regressions had nosignificant effects on the other coefficients, and
the own coefficient was always insignificant.8 Errors in measuring the
assessment ratio in this manner, however, may be partly responsible for these

results: in Georgia, for example, the number of acres of farm land listed by
black tax—payers exceeds the census figures reported by black farm owners in

all but five counties, especially in the black belt and urban areas. This
suggests that some of the land reported to the Georgia tax authorities may not
have been agricultural use, particularly in urban counties, and assigning to
it a per—acre market value implied by the census farm data may be incorrect.9
The major implication of these findings, however, is that the relative
level of black wealth in 1910 is clearly overstated by the tax data.
Furthermore, given that blacks emerged from slavery with almost no non—human
wealth, and that government discrimination in the South evidently increased in
the late 19th and early 20th century (see, for example, C. Vann Woodward;
Morgan Kousser, 1974, 1980a; my 1982b dissertation), the possibility that the
relative rate of growth of black wealth is biased upwards by increasingly

discriminatory assessment ratios cannot be discounted.1° While a definitive
answer to this question is beyond the scope of this comment, some preliminary
calculations suggest that the bias may be significant although not large

—7—

enough to affect the substantive time—series conclusions. To illustrate this
point in the Virginia case, assume that the relative assessment ratio on all
taxable wealth was unity in 1890 (surely a lower bound), and in 1910 at the

value implied by Snovely's figures (pp. 75—76) for real estate (1.22). Under
this assumption, increasingly discriminatory assessment ratios could account
for as much as 28.6% of the relative growth of black per capita wealth in

Virginia over the two decades.1' While this figure is far from trivial and
indicates the need to be cautious before assuming racial stability in
assessment ratios over time (compare Higgs, p. 726), the magnitude of the bias
is not sufficient to reverse the principal conclusion that blacks outpaced
whites in accumulating wealth.'2

This comment has presented additional evidence on wealth accumulation by

Southern blacks in the period before World War 1. Analysis of these data
indicates that blacks generally accumulated property at a more rapid pace than
whites, but that only limited conclusions may be drawn from cross—sectional

regressions of assessed wealth. Evidence for one state suggests that failure
to control for within—state variation in assessment practices may bias the
inferences drawn from the cross—sectional regressions, and that black peoperty

was assessed closer to market value than white property. Finally, accounting
for changes in relative assessment ratios over time may significantly reduce
the relative rate of growth of black wealth, although not enough to reverse

the substantive time—series results. In light of these findings, one useful
extension of this work would be to estimate cross—sectional regressions of
black wealth for different years, and to further analyze the determinants and
implications of intrastate and race differences in assessment ratios.

studies making use of the Virginia data. Morgan Kousser (1980a, 1980b)
uses the North Carolina and Kentucky data to study the effects of changing
black political power in the late 19th century on the racial division of
school tax burdens and public school expenditures; see my 1982a article

2. Following Higgs the Warren—Peason wholesale price index is the deflator.

3. An alternative procedure is to use the coefficients from the Louisiana
regressions (see Table 2) to predict per capita black wealth in New
Orleans in 1910, and assume that the ratio (per capita black wealth in New
Orleans/per capita black wealth, all other parishes) remained constant

over the period. Although the levels are sensitive to the method
employed, the growth rate of black wealth is not, and the conclusions
reached in the text are unaffected.

4. This specification is similar to the one estimated by Higgs (p. 731) but

with cotton income lagged once to preserve degrees of freedom. See Roger
Ransom and Richard Sutch, (Table 9.2, p. 175), line 1, for evidence on the
boll weevil's impact on cotton production in Louisiana in the early 20th

century. Data on cotton Income were derived from Statistical Abstract of
the United States, various years. Short run fluctuations in cotton income
were significantly related to black wealth accumulation in Arkansas (t =

1.96),

but were less influential in North Carolina (t =

1.4).

additional regressions are available from the author on request.

5. The assessment ratios were estimated by the Virginia Tax Commission, whose
function was "to consider and report on all questions pertaining to the
assessment and collection of taxes," and are given in the Report of the

Joint Committee on Tax Revision, Virginia, 1914, pp. 11—12, 251. The
assessment ratios on real estate were derived by comparing the sales price
and assessed values of 20,694 transactions occurring between February 1,

1912 and January 31, 1913. The assessment ratios on personal property
apply to farm machinery and livestock, and were derived by comparing the

assessed values with 1910 census data on a per unit basis. Because
Virginia law provided for a complete re—assessment of all property every
five years had the committee applied the same procedures to data collected
before the last reassessment (in 1910) a different cross—sectional pattern

in assessment ratios may have occurred. Ideally, assessment ratios for
each year (1909—1911) should be averaged into a single measure, but the

data needed for such a calculation are unavailable. Furthermore, while
the committee collected data on the race of the taxpayer, the published
assessment ratios (used in the Virginia regressions) are not race—

specific. In the regressions ASR is set equal to ArASRr +
(1_ar)ASRp
where ar is the share of real estate in total assessed value, ASRr is the

assessment ratio on real estate, and ASR is the assessment ratio on
personal property. The regression results are unaffected if ASRr is
substituted for ASR.

6. The explanation for the change in sign is straightforward. The constant
terms in Riggs' regressions are the coefficients of 1/sqrt (GLS weight).
Since these coefficients are positive, it follows that black wealth was
negatively related to the absolute number of blacks (or black adult males)

—10—

in the county, which was positively correlated with the percent black.
Four Georgia counties with black population majorities (Camden,
Glynn, Liberty, and McIntosh) specialized in rice production, grew
virtually no cotton, had relatively high levels of per capita black wealth
and low rates of tenancy, and were geographically distinct from the rest

of the black belt. If a dummy variable distinguishing these counties
(RICE) is added to the Georgia regressions, the coefficient of percent
black becomes a larger negative number, and is significant at the 15%
level in equation (3).

7. The correlation coefficient (r) between the tax and census values was 0.55
in North Carolina, compared to 0.62 in Georgia (Riggs, p. 727).
Eliminating outliers (following the same procedures outlined by Riggs, pp.
727—28) from the North Carolina regressions had no effect on the
regression results.

8. On the other hand, eliminating counties from the Georgia regressions that
Higgs (pp. 727—728) identified as having much lower or higher than average
assessment ratios on farm real estate yielded significant negative
coefficients on population density, and insignificant coefficients on the
cotton share, land value, and the plantation dummy (except equation

(3)). Furthermore, the coefficients of the cotton share and population
density are extremely sensitive to a single observation, Chatham, which

contains the city of Savannah. If this county i8 deleted, both
coefficients are sharply reduced in magnitude and become statistically

insignificant. These results contradict Riggs' statement (p. 728) that
"the substantive conclusions [for Georgia] are completely insensitive to

—11—

the choice among...data sets." The additional regressions are available
from the author on request.

9. A regression of the ratio of the census and tax acreage figures for
Georgia in 1910 (RCATA) on percent black and population density yielded
the following results (absolute value of t—statistics In parentheses):

RCATA =

0.86 — 0.13 BPOP/POP — 0.37
(21.10) (1.73)

N = 130

POP/SQMI

(2.23)

F = 3.66

R2 =

0.03

The mean value of the dependent variable was 0.78. Dubois (p. 526)
asserted that the discrepancy between the tax and census acreage figures

could be accounted for by "land sublet by negro owners to tenants." This
seems implausible in urban counties, and does not explain why the number
of acres listed by white taxpayers exceeds the number of acres owned by
whites as reported in the 1910 census of agriculture (defined as the total

acreage in farms less acreage reported by black farm owners). In this
context, it is also worth noting that the Georgia auditor's reports never
explicitly state that the tax acreage figures refer only to farm land.

10. Redistribution of the black population towards areas with above average
assessment ratios could have raised the average assessment ratio on black

property, even if discrimination did not change. Given that the
percentage of blacks residing in the black belt declined between 1880 and
1910, and that the rate at which whites urbanized was greater than blacks,
geographic redistribution probably lowered the relative assessment ratio,

—12—

ceteris paribus.

11 This figure would be biased upwards if, as Snavely argued (p. 90),
personal property was assessed In a non—discriminatory manner.

12. Preliminary calculations suggest that the bias In the Georgia case could

be much larger. Despite the reservations noted in the text and in
footnote 9, Higgs' procedure (p. 727—28) can be used to calculate the
relative assessment on farm real estate in Georgia for 1910; the result is

1.46. If the relative assessment ratio were one in 1880 (agaIn, a lower
bound), the relative growth rate of black wealth in Georgia from 1880 to
1910 would be overstated by 48% (1.4% compared to 2.7), but again the
substantive conclusions remains the same.
