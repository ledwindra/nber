The Mortality Consequences of Distinctively Black Names
Lisa Cook, Trevon Logan, and John Parman
NBER Working Paper No. 21625
October 2015
JEL No. I1,J15,N31,N32
ABSTRACT
Race-specific given names have been linked to a range of negative outcomes in contemporary studies,
but little is known about their long term consequences. Building on recent research which documents
the existence of a national naming pattern for African American males in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries (Cook, Logan and Parman 2014), we analyze long-term consequences of distinctively
racialized names. Using over three million death certificates from Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and
North Carolina from 1802 to 1970, we find a robust within-race mortality difference for African American
men who had distinctively black names. Having an African American name added more than one
year of life relative to other African American males. The result is robust to controlling for the age
pattern of mortality over time and environmental factors which could drive the mortality relationship.
The result is not consistently present for infant and child mortality, however. As much as 10% of
the historical between-race mortality gap would have been closed if every black man were given a
black name. Suggestive evidence implies that cultural factors not captured by socioeconomic or human
capital measures may be related to the mortality differential.

Introduction

Numerous studies have found that those with race-specific first names are negatively affected
in terms of birth outcomes, job interview callbacks, and mentoring [Busse and Seraydarian
1977; Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Figlio 2005; Ginther et al. 2011; Milkman et al.
2012]. The literature has yet to consider long-term consequences of distinctively racialized
names. Racialized names may be related to a host of other factors that play out over
the life cycle, and identifying these effects would be important as they may be cumulative.
Recently, scholars have uncovered a national racial naming pattern among African Americans
that predates the Civil Rights Movement [Cook, Logan and Parman 2014, Goldstein and
Stecklov 2014]. We now know that a distinct set of given names were used by African
Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While the finding of an
historical racial naming pattern is inherently interesting, the implications of having a black
name remain largely unexplored.
In this paper we present the first evidence of long-term consequences of distinctively
black names (see Table 1). We concentrate on a straightforward outcome, mortality, using
newly-available death certificate data (roughly 3 million records). Mortality is an important
dimension of well-being and data are available for many historical settings [Parman 2012].
Key for our analysis, death certificates contain reliable information about race, name, and
lifespan.
Our primary objective is to examine whether there is a relationship between having one of
the historical black names and within-race mortality. We adopt a straightforward empirical
strategy, estimating the effect of names on longevity after controlling for the time pattern

2

of mortality and counties of birth and death. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
estimate the effect of racial names on mortality or health outcomes.
We find that the effects of a distinctively African American name on mortality are quite
large. Conditional on survival to age 10, African American men with distinctively black
names live more than one year longer than other African American men. In elasticity terms,
a black name increases lifespan by more than ten percent. The correlation we find between
distinctively African American names and lifespan is not sensitive to the functional form
used to estimate the relationship. We find mixed evidence that possessing a black name was
related to infant or child mortality. The effect was present over the entirety of adulthood,
which suggests that the effect was cumulative. We find that as much as ten percent of
the historical interracial mortality gap would have been closed if every black man had been
given a black name. These results are robust to regional variation, holding over four distinct
states– Alabama, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina, which guards against the finding
being driven by environmental, epidemiological, or contextual factors.
In attempting to uncover evidence on mechanisms behind this mortality differential, we
analyze the socioeconomic correlates of given names in census records. The census results
provide little evidence that the name effect is due to socioeconomic status or to human-capital
differences for those who have African American names. There are, however, demographic
differences that are correlated with the names, consistent with historical narrative evidence
[Gutman 1976]. While the results do uncover important demographic differences that were
previously unknown, they do not conclusively uncover the source of the robust mortality
difference. Importantly, men with African American names were more likely to have sons
with African American names, and men with fathers who had distinctively black names
lived longer than other men even if they did not have a distinctively black name themselves.
Overall, the results suggests cultural factors may be at play in both the transmission of
distinctively black names and their mortality effects.

Empirical Strategy

We estimate the relationship between racial names and mortality in a straightforward way.
Since our sample is drawn from death records all deaths are observed. We first estimate a
linear regression where lifespan (conditional on survival to age 10) is the dependent variable.
0

Lif espani = α + βBlackN ame + X γ + εi
To provide an elasticity interpretation we estimate a regression where the natural log of
lifespan is the dependent variable.
0

ln Lif espani = α + βBlackN ame + X γ + εi
In both regressions Black Name is an indicator for the presence of an African American
name conditional on being an African American man. This is our coefficient of interest as it
estimates the difference in lifespan for African American men with a distinctive name relative
to other African American men. We concentrate on intraracial differences in mortality
since, over the time period covered, the decline in black mortality was faster than for white
mortality. Fully accounting for this difference in a empirical model requires that the results
effect for black names be relative to other black men– for that reason we restrict our sample
for the regression analysis to black men.1 The vector X includes controls for year of death
and year of death squared to account for general time trends in mortality.2
We stress two points for the interpretation of the effect of African American names. First,
our measure of names is dichotomous. One either has a distinctive name or not— as such
our estimates are at the extensive margin. The coefficient measures the average mortality
difference for black men holding one of the names listed in Table 1. Other observational
studies have used an index which weights the relative exclusivity of a given name, an intensive
1

Since relatively few white men have black names by design, the effects of black names for white men are
not statistically significant in regressions which include all men.

While one would typically control for year of birth rather than year of death, due to age misreporting
year of birth is subject to potentially large measurement error. Year of death, as it is recorded when the
death occurs, is measured precisely.

measure. We concentrate on the extensive measure since the names themselves are quite
distinct and highly racialized as a class of names by design.3 We also stress that our estimate
of the mortality difference is a mortality differential within race.
We also estimate the survival function using a standard Cox proportional hazard model

h

0

hit (t) = ho (t) exp βBlackN ame + X γ

i

Where i indexes the individual, t time (year) of death, and ho (t) is the baseline hazard,
which is integrated out using the partial likelihood method. In the Cox model, if a coefficient
is greater than zero (if the hazard ratio > 1 ), then the variable is correlated with a shorter
life. Similarly, if a coefficient is less than zero (if the hazard ratio < 1 ), then the variable is
correlated with a longer life. The estimates from the hazard model give us the percentage
differences in the waiting time to mortality.
Before turning to the results, it is useful to consider the possible biases of the estimate
of β that could be due to selection. It could certainly be the case that those with African
American names are more likely to be aged to the extent that these names represent a
nineteenth century naming pattern. For this reason we explicitly control for year of death
in the specifications. With these controls included the estimated name effect would have to
be attributable to the name itself and not the time in which the name was assigned.4
3

Given the methodology in Cook, Logan and Parman [2014], each name identified would have a high
index value if a names index were used.
4
Another issue of selection with a hazard estimate is truncation. In our case, those born in North
Carolina, for example, but dying elsewhere are not included in the data. In a basic sense, these estimates
are permanently missing, but if their distribution of deaths is different our estimates will not be applicable.
We note that this bias will be present only if the death distribution for those truncated is different. As
we noted earlier, there is no evidence that migrants have a different death distribution than non-migrants
[Sanders and Muszynska 2009]. In addition, recent methods of proportional hazard estimation have made it
possible to correct for the potential of truncation to impact the results [Huber-Carol and Vonta 2004, Tsai
2009, Copas and Farewell 2001, Tsai, Jewell and Wang 1987, Vardi 1982]. Also, since we focus on within-race
differences by the presence of a distinctively African American name our hazard estimates would be biased
only if those with distinctively African American names were selectively missing, which we view as unlikely.

3.1

Death Record Summary Statistics

We use one measure of length of life — total lifespan measured by year of death minus
year of birth. In our primary specification we restrict attention to adult mortality (lifespan
conditional on survival to age ten) due to the large declines in infant and child mortality
early in the twentieth century. The total sample of death records for each state is large, with
nearly 100,000 males for Missouri, 300,000 for Alabama, 1.3 million for North Carolina, and
over 1.5 million for Illinois. The states offer a broad range of racial compositions, with Illinois
and Missouri having relatively low percentages of African Americans, 5.5 and 8.2 percent
respectively, and North Carolina being over 30 percent black and Alabama being nearly 50
percent black. Table 2 summarizes the sample sizes for each state and the degree of racial
distinction for the black names.5 In all four states, the distinctively African American names
identified in Cook, Logan and Parman [2014] are far more frequently held among African
Americans than among whites.6 The shares of black individuals with an African American
name are 1.7, 1.4, 1.7 and 1.3 percent for Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina,
respectively. The shares of white individuals with an African American name are 0.6, 0.7,
0.6 and 0.4 percent for Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, respectively.7
Average lifespan, conditional on survival to age 10, varies for each state, from being under
40 in Alabama (38.73), over 40 in Missouri (43.8), under 50 in Illinois (48.90), to nearly 60
in North Carolina (58.79). For the deaths we observe, which, on average, occurred between
1925 and 1945, the average person was born in the late nineteenth century. The summary
statistics reveal some differences by race in each state. Whites could expect to live more
than four years longer than African Americans, on average, in Alabama and Missouri and
5

Table A1 in the appendix gives summary statistics for length of life by state.
Importantly, the analysis here includes a state, Missouri, which was not used in Cook, Logan, and
Parman [2014]. As such, the distinctive name pattern documented there holds in an independent data
source with a different racial composition.

The disproportionality of the names is similar to that seen in modern analysis of black names [Bertrand
and Mullainathan 2004; Fryer and Levitt 2004].

estimates agree broadly to other summary measures of the population of each state for the
early twentieth century.9

3.2

Distinctively Black Names and Mortality

Table 3 shows the estimates of the regression models described above. We analyze each
state separately due to different time periods covered and to give easily interpreted results of
the within-state black mortality differential due to black names. We also control for county
of death to act as a control for later-life geographic factors. The results show that having
an African American name (column I) increases the lifespan by more than three years in
Alabama (3.48), two years in Illinois (2.48) more than seven years in Missouri (7.52) and
nearly four years in North Carolina (3.93). All of the estimates are statistically significant
at all conventional levels.
Column II uses the semi-logarithmic specification, and the general pattern seen in Column
I is present. The elasticity, the percentage increase in the length of life due to the presence
of a distinctively African American name, ranges from a low of five percent percent in
Illinois to nearly 17.9 percent in Missouri.10 Column III shows the estimates of the hazard
model, which shows that the hazard of mortality was substantially lower for those with a
distinctive African American name. The estimates range from a fifteen-percent (in Illinois)
to a thirty-three-percent (in Missouri) decrease in the hazard of mortality due to an African
8

See Historical Statistics of the United States, Millennial Edition. One question for the generalizability
of our analysis is the degree to which one can draw inferences from any state to the rest of the nation. To
do this we compared the deaths in the 1880 Federal Death Census to those for the nation as a whole (not
reported). What we found was that the differences for death (age at death and differences by sex and race)
were similar for each state by region. It is true, however, that Southern states were different from the
rest of the nation. Importantly, we found no difference in white mortality (age at death) for the Carolinas
or Alabama when compared to the rest of the nation. There are differences for blacks when compared
to the rest of the nation, but blacks in Alabama and North Carolina are no different in their average age
at death from blacks in the South more generally. Given the results from the 1880 Federal Death Census
comparison, we are confident that our analysis can be extended, with some caveats, to the general pattern
for the Southern United States.

American name. The correlations suggest that, if every African American man was assigned
a distinctively African American name, the racial mortality gap at the time would have been
cut by more than ten percent.
Table 3 shows that there was a substantial increase in the length of life correlated with
having a black name. This difference in mortality is striking and quite large and adds a new
dimension to the existing analysis of racial differences in mortality in the American past.
Previous studies of racial differences in mortality have found significant racial differences,
even by cause [Costa 2005, Costa et al. 2007], but these studies have not linked to the
socioeconomic or cultural factors nor have they looked within race to uncover those racial
differences. For example, Logan [2009] found differences by migratory status, but how this
was linked to other factors remains unclear. We analyzed the migration issue with the North
Carolina data (in keeping with choosing a state where there would have been significant
out-migration during this time period). For all men born in North Carolina, the black name
effect on mortality in a linear regression is 0.762 years (s.e. 0.286, t=2.66). For all men who
were born outside of North Carolina who died in North Carolina, the black name effect is
0.897 (s.e. 0.369, t=2.43).
It could be the case that the hazard varies by age, such that the mortality effects we
estimate above are concentrated in advanced ages. If this were the case, the average effect
we estimate may be due to an error in age reporting or some other factor that would be
related to ages reported in death records. We address this issue directly in Figure 1, where we
show Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival function for black men with and without a black
name. The results by state show that the survival function by age is not age-variant. The
increased survival rate for black men with black names is seen over the entire age structure.11
11

We stress that it is unlikely that the results of Table 3 are driven by age-misreporting for those with
distinctive names. As noted earlier, our coefficient of interest is for those who were named on death records
and who were African American males. If racial names are correlated with extended family networks, those
with distinctive names would be more likely to have correctly reported ages at death as they would likely
have more local representatives who could report accurate years of birth. Since the stylized fact is that
African Americans are assumed to be older than they truly are at death, any effect of age misreporting
would go in the opposite direction. This implies that our mortality estimates for names could be a lower
bound estimate.

3.3

Infant and Child Mortality

Given the results in Table 3, it is natural to ask if the effects extend to infant and child
mortality.12 Table 3 also shows the estimates of the regression models where the dependent
variable is the length of life conditional on dying before age 11. In all specifications, the
effect of a distinctive name is relatively small and is not statistically significant in all states.
In the regression estimates (column IV), the effect of a distinctive name is anywhere from a
negative impact of three quarters of a year of life (in Missouri) to an increase of one year (in
Illinois). The elasticity estimates (column V) range from less than 2 percent (in Alabama)
to more than 25 percent (in Illinois). In contrast to the estimates of later mortality, there is
considerable heterogeneity in the estimates.13
One additional question, related to infant and child mortality, would be to investigate
whether men with black names were less likely to die before age 10. To investigate this issue
we estimated a linear probability model where the dependent variable was an indicator for
survival to age 10. For Alabama the coefficient on black name was 0.0501 (s.e. 0.00824,
t=6.07), for Illinois the coefficient on black name was 0.0839 (s.e. 0.00817, t=10.27), for
Missouri the coefficient was 0.0506885 (s.e. 0.3967, t=1.28), and for North Carolina the
coefficient was -0.0033763 (s.e. 0.003947, t=-0.86). Overall, the results imply that men with
black names were less likely to die before age 10 in Alabama and Illinois, but that there was
no effect in Missouri and North Carolina. One issue with this interpretation is that many
children are unnamed if they died at particularly young ages, and the proper counterfactual
would need to account for the names that would have been assigned to children who died
12

As we described earlier, if the result is due to cumulative effects we would suspect that distinctive names
would confer few advantages at early life, where mortality is more likely due to exogenous factors such as
disease environment. This would be especially true during this time period. On the other hand, there could
be effects after infancy yielding effects for early life mortality. While there are known racial differences in
child mortality in the past [Costa 2004], there is nothing to suspect that the effects of names would be large
at young ages. There is little evidence of intraracial differences in infant mortality in the past. Gutman
[1976] describes the usual practice of naming children after their deceased siblings. If this trend continued
during the time period we study, then we would be more likely to observe deaths to distinctive names if
children born in earlier cohorts were subject to a high-infant mortality environment.
13
Figure 1 also shows these effects. Part of this could be due to differences in infant mortality coverage in
death records, the preponderance of unnamed children in death records, or other measurement issues.

before they were named. In general, however, the name effect is not present at early ages in
a systematic way and does not exhibit the robustness of the later-life mortality relationship.
There is some evidence that black names are related to survival before age 10.

4

Considering Possible Mechanisms

4.1

Name Selection

It could be the case that the name effect is a figment of selection. If those with distinctive
names who experienced positive outcomes chose to retain their names while others discarded
them, the result could be endogenous. This would be an interesting fact as the current
literature discusses the ways that African Americans attempt to avoid the racial stigma of
black names. If African Americans in the past chose to use those names due to positive
outcomes that would, in and of itself, be worthy of note. The historical record, however,
does not provide any evidence of African Americans adopting different first names after
the Reconstruction era. In fact, the very lack of any literature documenting this practice
suggests that it was rare.14 To the extent that the races separated after the Reconstruction
era [Woodward 1955], fewer interracial interactions would have given African American less
incentive to change names, and it is unclear why those with the most distinctive African
American names would retain them.
Overall, unlike the literature on European immigrants, whose name changes during the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are well documented, there is no evidence that
African Americans did the same. While the lack of a literature on this subject does not mean
it did not occur, the lack of a discussion stands in stark contrast to the literature on name
changes after the Civil War and the literature on racial passing. Similarly, the literature on
name changes consistently shows that name changes were made by those seeking to avoid the
14

While Litwack [1979] describes the power of names and the ability to choose names after emancipation,
the later history of African American life in the South provides no discussion of this issue [Litwack 1998,
Hahn 2003, Ritterhouse 2006, Hale 1998].

10

stigma of an ethnic name. The fact that our result points to a positive effect of a racialized
name casts further doubt on the notion that a significant fraction of the result would be due
to selection itself. If those who ceased to use their racialized given names in their lives did
so in hopes of better life outcomes, those hopes appear to have been misplaced.

4.2

Socioeconomic Effects

We consider the implications of wealth and socioeconomic effects more generally in Table 4.
As in Cook, Logan and Parman [2014], we do not find differences in occupation due to
having a black name. There are differences in education, but those differences show that
those with black names were less likely to be literate and less likely to be enrolled in school.
The direction of these effects would run counter to the mortality differences we find. To the
extent that these names reflected longstanding family structures we would expect there to
be a positive effect of socioeconomic status due to the names. We would predict that those
with black names would be more likely to come from intact families, for example, since the
names we analyze are passed down from father to son. We find no differences in family size,
school attendance, literacy, single parent households, or occupation (adult or child) that are
related to black names in Table 4. Another factor could be migration, a primary means of
investing in human capital in the past. We also analyzed the census data to see if migration
was related to black names. In a linear probability model, the effect of having a black name
on migration (pooled 1900-1920, with year fixed effects) was -.000283 (s.e. 0.00113, t=-0.25)
for all men over the age of 15. In 1910 the effect was -0.0012559 (s.e. 0.00245, t=-0.51) and
in 1920 the effect was -0.002306 (s.e. 0.00483, t=-0.53). This evidence suggests that having
a black name was not related to interstate migration.
This lack of differences in socioeconomic outcomes runs counter to the findings in Goldstein and Stecklov [2014], who find that black names were associated with lower socioeconomic status via occupation. One reason why our results may differ from theirs is that
they use a names index which rates each individual name by its distinctiveness. Unlike the
11

method used in Cook, Logan, and Parman [2014], a names index is not conditioned on frequency/commonness. Empirically, it is difficult to distinguish unique name effects and racial
name effects. Both would have the same index value.15 Extending the previous analysis,
we also consider the demographic differences that could be attributed to names in Table 4.
Here, we do find some important distinctions. First, we find that black men with black
names have fewer children, on average. Also, black men with black names are less likely to
be (currently) married and more likely to never have been married. We find that there are
no distinctions by black name on being divorced, however. The differences in demographic
outcomes that we find here by name are a new finding that leads to a range of questions. The
widower results appear to be consistent with the mortality estimates, and yet the marriage
and never-married results suggests that men with black names had different family structure. Given the lack of an occupational difference, it is difficult to believe that a standard
marriage-market explanations would apply. On the other hand, the results for literacy and
school attendance suggest that men with black names may have been less valued as spouses.
This, too, stands in contrast to the divorce results– we would expect lower-quality marital
matches to be more likely to divorce.

4.3

Family/Cultural Effects

We explored the potential for a cultural transmission by analyzing the first names of fathers
and sons in the death certificate data where both were available. The death records for
Alabama have digitized father and son names. Those with a distinctively black name were
no more or less likely to have a missing father in the death records. For black men with
black names, 55.11% had fathers names in the records, and 56.83% of black men without
15

Another problem of using such an index to uncover within-race differences is that, by construction, the
majority of blacks will have high index value names relative to whites. The slope of the relationship over all
names may obscure the difference within race which is our primary interest. As such, even when estimating
a relationship (such as income) that varies by race, the inclusion of the name index and race may yield a
biased estimate. We explicitly estimate the effect of a black name within race to avoid such confounders.
An additional difference is that our measure is at the extensive margin, since we use a relatively small set
of names that have been verified in non-census data sources and which we establish were common among
African American men at the time.

12

black names had fathers listed in the records. We then looked to see if fathers who had black
names were more likely to have sons who also had black names.16 We found that for black
men who had black names, 13.95% had a father with a black name, while only 1.58% of black
men without black names had a father with a black name. We also see this in the reverse.
For black fathers with black names in the Alabama data, 12.67% had a son with a black
name, while only 1.42% of other black fathers had black sons in the data with black names.
We view this as further evidence of family-cultural effects and evidence of intergenerational
transmission of black names.
We also modified the regressions for Alabama to include a black father name to see
if a father having a black names was related to a longer lifespan. We found that a men
with fathers who had black names (whether they were black named themselves) did live
longer than others. The elasticity estimates suggest that having a black father resulted in
an 8.95% longer lifespan, even when controlling for whether the deceased himself had black
name himself. In effect, it does appear as if the names are related to intergenerational
transmission, are perhaps cumulative, and reflect an omitted cultural factor which is related
to within-race mortality differences. This suggestive evidence is difficult to reconcile with
the results in Table 4, because we find few socioeconomic effects there. If there is a cultural
mechanism at play, it does not appear to operate through socioeconomic status. Although
there appears to be a family-cultural effect, it is difficult to see how it produces the mortality
effects we find.

5

Conclusion

We find that that having a distinctively African American name was strongly correlated
with mortality. Our estimates imply that those with distinctively African American names
16

We did so because the naming pattern suggested by Gutman suggests that male family members could
be named for fathers and other male relatives. As such, the mechanism behind this result would be the same
(family/cultural effects), and restricting the analysis to father-son name matching results in a much smaller
sample size in the Alabama records.

13

lived nearly a year longer than other African Americans. This difference is striking in that
it is a within-race and within-gender effect. Unlike the negative outcomes associated with
black names today, we find a large and positive effect from having a black name in the
past. The literature gives us few strong clues about potential mechanisms at this point,
and we therefore argue that this robust correlation should be a springboard for future work
into socioeconomic differences in mortality among African Americans. As this exploration
has shown, concentrating on interracial differences can obscure important and neglected
intraracial differences in outcomes.
At present, the existing analysis suggest that the result is likely not due to either selection
on names nor to a wealth effect. Uncovering the mechanism underlying the mortality result
will require a wealth of additional empirical evidence as well. If it is cultural factors that
explain this result, this implies that empirical evidence must come from both quantitative
and qualitative sources. This would not only include more quantifiable data but also detailed
narrative analysis of the names of prominent individuals, analysis of church registers, lists of
African Americans in prestigious occupations, and the like. That this hitherto unknown fact
appears to have such a large effect on mortality suggests that there are likely several pieces
of the African American demographic experience which remain hidden from contemporary
scholarship and which require serious and sustained investigation. The discovery of the specific causes of this relationship will go hand in hand with the development of the nascent
literature on the political and social histories of African Americans in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries which could uncover further robust within-race differences in
outcomes. This period has been relatively neglected in quantitative historical and demographic scholarship, and findings such as the mortality relationship presented here should
stimulate further research into this period of American history.

Data from Death Records

We use the death records from four states: Alabama, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina.
These are the only four states that have sizable numbers of death records available for
the time period of interest with both name and race digitized. Each state had different
death registration histories, different racial compositions, and cover different regions of the
country. The basic information about death, cause of death, age at death, occupation, and
parental information is available for all years for all four states. However, the time spans
and underlying sources of the records vary across the states.
The Alabama records are drawn from the Alabama Deaths and Burials Index created
by the Genealogical Society of Utah for the years 1881 to 1959. For the early years, the
index is drawn from multiple sources including church, civil and family records of Alabama
deaths and burials. Beginning with 1908, state law required that all deaths within the
state be registered with death certificates being filed with the Alabama Center for Health
Statistics. A compliance rate of 90 percent was achieved by 1925 at which point the state
was admitted to the federal death registration area, an indication that the state had achieved
a high standard of performance in registration standards.17 The index for 1908 through 1974
is based on these death certificates.
The Illinois names are drawn from all of the available records in the Illinois deaths and
stillbirths index for 1916 to 1947. This index includes information transcribed from one-page
pre-printed death certificate forms. The 1916 start date for the records is the result of a
1915 statute that required the State Board of Health (succeeded by the Illinois Department
of Public Health) and county clerks to record deaths and stillbirths. To aid in achieving
high compliance rates, the statute created a system of financial incentives for registrars.
Statewide compliance with this statue was at 95 percent by 1919.
17

A brief history of the death registration area including the years in which states were admitted to the
area is available in the Census Bureau’s Physicians’ Handbook [1939].

22

The death records for the state of Missouri are taken from the Missouri Birth and Death
Records Database maintained by the Missouri Secretary of State’s office. The database
contains information from individual death certificates transcribed from microfilm stored
at the Missouri State Archives. The database consists of over 185,000 death records. The
death records extend back to the early 1850s but widespread coverage does not begin until
the early 1880s when Missouri passed legislation requiring the Board of Health to supervise
the registration of births and deaths.18 The coverage of the database extends up to 1909.
In this year, state legislation introduced mandatory statewide collection of death certificates
with the records maintained by the Missouri Bureau of Vital Records. By 1911, collection
was sufficiently uniform for Missouri to be admitted to the federal death registration area.
While these post-1909 records have been partially transcribed, the transcribed information
does not contain the year of birth or age at death data required for this study.
The North Carolina data are constructed from the universe of death certificates for individuals who died between the years of 1910 and 1975.19 The upper end of this range is
determined by the availability of publicly available digitized death certificates. The lower end
of the range is chosen such that most individuals will have fully recorded death certificates,
and as such we start our period after the standardization of causes of death. Before this
time death registrations and the policies related to death registrations were not uniform.20
Summary statistics for the death records in each state are provided in Table A1.

A.2

Advantages and Disadvantages of Death Records

The advantages of death certificates for analyzing the relationship between names and mortality are numerous. First, death certificates are person-specific records while census enumer18

Despite this supervision, there were still many problems with non-compliance. This can be seen in
the data with several counties either not appearing in the database at all or having far fewer deaths than
expected given the county populations and historical mortality rates. It is also confirmed by Missouri’s
legislative history.
19
This process is more fully described in Logan and Parman [2014].
20
Even once the death registration was standardized, compliance still varied. North Carolina would not
achieve the standard of registration performance needed to be admitted to the federal death registration
area until 1916.

23

ation is household-based. Second, for each set of death records that we use death certification
was required early in the twentieth century, so those individuals born in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries corresponding to the period in which the names were identified
in the census records (1890-1920) are also highly likely to appear in the death records.
There are disadvantages to death certificates data as well.

While we can capture in-

trastate migration (the dominant migratory pattern early in the century), we cannot capture
the effects of selective migration. While there certainly was selective migration– migrants
have been shown more likely to be urban and more educated in a variety of studies, it does
not appear that migration itself was related to longer life– there is no statistical difference in
the mortality of black migrants versus non-migrants during the Great Migration for cohorts
born 1905-1925, either overall or for age specific mortality [Black et al. 2015]. Recent work
has also documented that blacks migrating out of the South during the Great Migration
had worse socioeconomic outcomes than those who stayed within the South, counter to the
conventional wisdom that migration was beneficial to black migrants [Eichenlaub et al 2010].
Furthermore, we concentrate on within race differences in mortality. Unless one could argue
that a distinctly black name was strongly related to the probability of migration (which itself could be investigated in subsequent work) our mortality results would not be influenced
by migration itself. This also helps to avoid the thorny issue of age-misreporting in death
registration data.21 Key for us is that fact that race of the deceased is known and observable
21
An additional concern about the quality of death certificate data is the fact that ages at death are known
to be biased for the African American population. Birth and death registrations early in the century are
incomplete and official counts of the African American population and number of deaths in that population
are known to be biased [US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1956, Eblen 1974, Coale and
Rives 1973, Elo 2001, Elo and Preston 1994, Preston at al. 1998, Rosenberg et al. 1999, Zelnik 1969].
Researchers have also documented significant measurement error in black ages among the aged, making
inference about racial differences in older age mortality, precisely where mortality is concentrated, difficult
[Elo et al. 1996, Hill et al. 1997]. Unfortunately, demographic research cannot escape the racial stain of
the past: while whites are found to have extremely low rates of age misreporting and generally excellent
population coverage throughout the twentieth century [Rosenwaike and Logue 1983, Hill et al. 2000], our
historical demographic data on the African American population is lacking [Ewbank 1987]. For example, Elo
[2001] notes that there exist no official lifetables for the black population from 1935 to 1970. The ”mortality
crossover,” where at older ages the mortality of blacks has been shown to be lower than whites, has been
challenged as a figment of age misreporting among the African American population [Coale and Kisker 1986,
Preston et al. 1996, Rosenwaike and Hill 1996]. Others, however, argue that the finding is robust and
extends to specific causes of death for the late twentieth century [Lynch et al. 2003, Eberstein and Nam

24

at the time of death and therefore the name of the deceased is not a signal of race itself.
Another concern would be that the death records used here also formed part of the independent verification of the names in Cook, Logan, and Parman [2014]. That is, the death
records from Alabama, Illinois, and North Carolina were used to determine the distinctiveness of black names. To guard against the possibility of an spurious correlation, we include
a fourth state, Missouri, that was not used to confirm name distinctiveness. As such, the
Missouri death records serve as an additional check of the black naming pattern and a check
for the mortality effects.
