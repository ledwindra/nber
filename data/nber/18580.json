    "abstract": "\n\nFinancial incentives have been shown to have strong positive short\u2010run effects for problematic health behaviors, but the effects often disappear once incentive programs end. This paper analyzes the results of a large\u2010scale workplace field experiment to examine whether self\u2010funded commitment contracts improve the long\u2010run effects of incentive programs. Consistent with existing findings, workers responded strongly to an incentive targeting use of the company gym, but long\u2010run effects were modest, at best. However, workers in the treatment arm that combined the incentive program with a commitment contract option showed long\u2010lasting behavioral changes, persisting even 1 year after the incentive ended.\n\n",
