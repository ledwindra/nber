Are Bond—Financed Deficits Inflationary?
A Ricardian Analysis

Abstract

This paper considers the possible theoretical validity of the following

"monetarjst hypothesis": that a constant, positive government budget
deficit can be maintained permanently and without inflation if it is

financed by the issue of bonds rather than money. The question is studied
in a discrete-time, perfect-foresight version of the competitive equilibrium model of Sidrauski (1967), modified by the inclusion of government

bonds as a third asset. It is shown that the monetarist hypothesis is
invalid if the deficit is defined exclusive of interest payments, but is

valid under the conventional definition. It is also shown that the stock
of bonds can grow indefinitely at a rate in excess of the rate of output
growth, provided that the difference is less than the rate of time preference.
In addition to the main analysis, the paper includes comments on alternative
deficit concepts, a brief consideration of data pertaining to the announced
budget plans of the Reagan administration, and a new look at a much-

studied issue: whether the operation of a Friedman-type constant money
growth rule (with non-activist fiscal rules) would be dynamically feasible.

I. Introduction
Recent developments in U.S. monetary and fiscal affairs have led to
a renewal of interest in issues reminiscent of the "Monetarist vs.

Keynesian" debates of previous decades. In particular, the Council of
Economic Advisers' 1982 forecast of a long string of unusually large
federal budget deficits, together with the Federal Reserve's repeated
avowals to keep monetary growth rates low, has conferred intense
practical interest upon the question of whether bond-financed deficits

have significant impact on aggregate demand and, thereby, on price level

and/or output magnitudes. The present paper includes a theoretical
discussion of that question and a brief consideration of some relevant
data pertaining to announced policy plans of the Reagan administration.
It also includes comments on alternative deficit concepts and a new look

at an issue that has been discussed frequently: whether the

operation

of a constant-money-growth policy rule of the type recommended by Milton
Friedman (1959) (1968) would be dynamically destabilizing.
It should be said at the outset that most of the analysis will be

conducted in a model that is distinctly sympathetic to the monetarist
position, that is, to the idea that bond-financed deficits are not

inflationary. The reason for slanting the analysis in this way is simple:
there seems currently to be very little academic support for the monetarist position, so an interesting question is whether an intellectually

respectable case for that position can be made. Whether the model in fact
conforms to the dictates of respectability is a matter of subjective judge-

ment, but it is at least built upon utility-maximizing behavior of

2

individual agents. It is not, however, here subjected to any empirical
testing.

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section II discusses some
preliminary notions concerning a possible ltRicardianI rationale for the

monetarist position. A Ricardian model is specified in Section III and
the main analytical results are obtained. The above-mentioned instability
issue is then taken up in Section IV. Following that digression, Section V
discusses some points cQncerning the relationship between inflation and

various deficit measures. Next, Section VI compares feasibility conditions derived in Section III with deficit paths implied by announced

policy plans of the Reagan administration. Finally, Section VII provides
a brief conclusion.

3

II. Analytical Issues
In order to limit the issues at hand in a manageable fashion, it will
be presumed throughout the formal analysis that the economy can be represented by a deterministic, aggregative, flexible-price, equilibrium model.

For some issues, such a model might be inadequate or misleading. Our
present concern, however, involves the influence on inflation rates of

a policy stance maintained over a number of years. For that type of
concern, a flexible-price equilibrium model--which presumes that aggregate demand effects are manifested primarily in price level or inflation
responses--seems well-suited.
As a matter of terminology--and to sharpen the issues-- let us define

a monetarist viewpoint as one which asserts that bond-financed deficits

have no effect on aggregate demand. More precisely, our monetarist
hypothesis is that, for given time paths of the money stock and government
spending, it does not matter for aggregate demand whether the necessary

revenue is raised by taxation or by bond sales. In other words, bondfinanced changes in tax receipts have--according to the monetarist
hypothesis--no effects on the price level or on output.

At this point, it perhaps needs to be asked whether there is
explicable reason to believe that the monetarist hypothesis (as defined)

might be correct. Discussions in the most well-known references notwith1/

standing,

be

the main intellectual support for such a position seems to

provided by the "Ricardian equivalence theorem,t' which obtains in

models in

some

which infinite-lived agents correctly take account of the

effects on future budgets of current budgetary actions. With fixed time
paths of government spending and money creation, any bond-financed change

4

in current taxes implies changes in future interest payments to be made

by the government. If these are to be financed by Lump-sum taxes and
if the government and private agents face the same market interest rates,
then the change will have no effect on a representative private agent's

intertemporal budget constraint. Under such conditions, then, a bondfinanced change in taxes will have no effect on the agent's supplies or

demands and, consequently, no effect on the price level or output--just
as predicted by the monetarist hypothesis.

The foregoing statement of the Ricardian result presumes that agents

have infinite life spans, which is obviously untrue. But, as is wellknown, Barro (1974) has demonstrated that an economy of finite-lived
agents who care about the utility of their offspring or parents may, under
reasonably general conditions, be treated for analytical purposes as one
2/

with infinite-lived agents.

Consequently, this feature of the analysis
3/

seems acceptable, given the aims of this investigation.

A second crucial assumption of the Ricardian analysis is that agents
are cognizant of effects on their own intertemporal budget constraints

of governmental debt issues. But this assumption is merely a particular
application of the hypothesis of rational expectations, the merits of
4/
which have been detailed extensively elsewhere.
Other complicating aspects of reality--uncertainty, distribution
effects, multiple interest rates--are also ignored in the Ricardian

equivalence argument. But the same is true of most policy-oriented
theoretical analyses of macroeconomic phenomena. As there is no apparent
reason why the issue at hand requires a different type of treatment, it
5/

would seem satisfactory to neglect them here, as elsewhere.

5

The discussion to this point seems to suggest that bond-financed

deficits could be non-inflationary. Each bond issue/tax reduction
ackage has no impact on aggregate demand or the price level, so
a sequence of bond-financed tax reductions should apparently have no

impact on the inflation rate. But it is possible that the situation
is different in the case of a permanent deficit, financed by in-

definitely-continuing issuance of bonds. In that case, as the deficit
continues the outstanding bond stock continues to grow. So,
accordingly, does the interest that must be paid each period on the

outstanding stock. If, for example, the magnitude of the real deficit
(net of interest payments) is kept at d, the real bond stock b will be
required to grow according to

(I)

b =

(l+r)b

i

+ d(l+r),

if the real rate of interest is constant at the value r. Thus the bond

stock will in this case grow without bound; if d >0, b- as

Barro

(l976)(l981) has argued that under these circumstances the

Ricardian equivalence argument breaks down. In particular, he suggests
that the rate of growth of the bond stock cannot exceed the economy's
rate of output growth--here temporarily taken to be zero--because "the
value of the outstanding stock of debt at any point in time is bounded
by the government's ...

present value of future taxing capacity" (1976,

p. 343). In a similar vein, Sargent and Wallace (1981) have argued that
"if the interest rate on bonds is greate than the economy's growth rate,
the real stock of bonds will grow faster than the size of the economy.
This cannot go on forever, since the demand for bonds places an upper

6

limit on the stock of bonds relative to the size of the economy"
6/

(1981, p.2).
These arguments do not, however, seem entirely convincing. First,
if the bond-issuance policy is permanently maintained, then taxes will

never have to be collected so the relevance of inadequate taxing

capacity is unclear. And under the Ricardian view, government bonds
are not regarded as net wealth to the private sector, so the size of
—7/
the bond stock also seems to be potentially irrelevant.
But whether or not the cited arguments by Barro and Sargent-Wallace
are subjectively convincing, analysis indicates that the basic idea
behind their contention is, as a matter of theory, correct. To develop

that analysis is the math objective of the next section. As it turns out,
however, the precise statements quoted above--and the implied limitations
on bond demands--are not correct.

7

III. Analysis
Our first task is to specify a maximizing model that incorporates
the crucial component of the Ricardian view, namely, infinite-lived
agents who correctly take account of the government budget constraint.

The model must also be one that accomodates money, bonds, and a physical

asset. To that end, let us adopt a discrete-time, perfect-foresight
version of the well-known model of Sidrauski (1967), modified to include
government bonds.

&J2J

In order to keep matters as simple as possible, let

us first consider a version with no depreciation or population growth.

Formally, we imagine an economy composed of a large number of
similar households, each of which seeks at period t to maximize

(2)

u(c,m) + u(c+i,m

+

Here c is consumption in period t and

u(c÷2,m2) +

m =

nominal money stock at the start of t and

with

Mt the household's

the price of the (single)

consumption good in t. The within-period utility function u is assumed
to be well-behaved so that unique, positive values are chosen for

and m÷i, t = 1,2

The discount factor

c

equals lI(l+5), with the

time-preference parameter '5 positive.

Each household has access to a production function that is homoge-

neous of degree one in its inputs, labor and capital. But since labor
is supplied inelastically, this function can be written as f(kt),

where k is the stock of capital held at the start of t. The function
f is assumed to satisfy the conditions V > 0, f" < 0, f'(O) =

f'() = 0.

Thus a unique, positive value will be chosen for

, and

k in

8

each period. Capital is simply unconsumed output, so its price is
the same as that of output and its real rate of return between t

and t+l is f'(ki).
Each household has the opportunity in t of purchasing government
Each bond is redeemed in t+l for one

bonds at a money price of

unit of money, so the nominal rate of return on bonds between t and
=

t+l is

The real rate r is then defined by l+rt =

(l+R)/(l+rr).

Finally, lump-sum transfers net of taxes in the

amount v are distributed to (or, if negative, collected from) the
household in period t. Consequently, the household's budget constraint for period t can be written as

parts, as follows:

(7b)

bt+l [t/(l+r) +

Conditions (3)-(l0) govern the agent's choices of c, k1,

m+1, b1,

and X, given initial asset stocks and time paths of prices and transfers.
Before continuing, let us pause to note that, because of our
assumptions on u,

will be positive for all t. Also, (6) and (7)

together imply that r =

f'(k÷i)

whenever bt+l > 0; the rates of return

10

on bonds and capital are the same if any bonds are demanded. Further-

as will be the case in a steady

more, if it happens that ?t+l =

state, then each of these rates of return will equal 3 (provided that

b

t+1

is positive).

Next we consider the government's budget. Expressing all quantities in per-capita terms and letting

denote government purchases of

output, we have the identity

(11)

+ QtBt+i

B

The government's choices of time paths for

b

and v must con-

form to (11) and (12).

Given time paths for three of the policy variables, equilibrium
values are determined by conditions (3)-(ll) and the national income
identity:

(13)

f(kt) =

c + kt÷l - k +

In particular, if time paths for M,

and v are selected by the

government, conditLons (3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(12), and (13) will determine

paths for c1, k, bt,

r, X ,

and

m.

We now have enough results to demonstrate that the Barro-SargentWallace claim is correct, provided that the deficit is defined exclusive

of interest payments on current debt. More specifically, we can show
that the model at hand will not support a zero-inflation equilibrium in

11

+v=

which a permanently-maintained positive deficit of

d

is

financed entirely by bond sales. To do so, we first observe that this
rnonetarist

hypothesis implies that (l+rr) m+i

steady-state conditions prevail for all variables except bt so that

rt

are constant, with r =

and

5

Then we insert the

hypothesized constant values in (12), obtaining

bt÷l =

(14)

(l+r)

t

b + (l+r)d

= 1,2

Next we note that the latter implies

bi = (1+r)t

(15)

b1+ (l+r)d [1 +

(l+r)

...

+

(l+r)thl,

which in turn implies

(16)

But

XT/(1+rT) =

bT+l

it

Xb1

+ Xd [(l+r) -

(l+r)lT]/r.

can then readily be seen that the expression in (16) approaches

Xb1 +Xd(l+r)/r as

which violates condition (lob). Equivalently,but
decays at

in different words, bT÷l grows at the rate r while
the rate 6 =

r,

so their product grows at the rate zero--i.e., does not

vanish as T increases. Thus the proposed monetarist path cannot be
12 /

an equilibriurn.
It should be noted, however, that a constant, maintained deficit
13 /

canbe

financed entirely by bond sales with no resulting inflation

if "deficit" is defined--as it typically is--to include current interest

payments. To make this argument, let us define the issue value of bonds
outstanding at t

by

B/(l+Ri).

Then with

-

= 0, the

12

government budget identity becomes

Now assume that policy keeps the real value of the right-hand side of
(17) constant at d, so that

(18)

= d

t+l

Next we conjecture that, with d, g, and N held constant, the price
level will also be constant so that (18) becomes

bt1 - b

d(l-i-r).

But in this case we have

so that

which does approach zero as T—- .
To verify that a non-inflationary steady state is also consistent
with the other relevant conditions, we argue as follows. Given values
for d and g, steady-state values of k, m, c, and X are determined by (4),

(5), (6), and (13). With bt > 0 for all t,

then,

equation (7a) holds as

an equality and determines r. Conditions (8) and (9) are satisfied with

constant values for rn, X, and k since T-10 as

Finally, with

g by (12), so (3) reduces

13

The policy rule in the last example is one which makes b grow
at a rate that decreases over time, approaching zero in the limit.

Let us next consider an example in which b grows at a constant,
positive rate that is numerically smaller than ô. For simplicity,

let us suppose that the rate is 5/2. From our previous discussions
it is clear that in this case condition (lOb) is not violated.
Furthermore, it can be readily verified that conditions (3)-(lOa)
are all satisfied by constant values of c, k, m, r, A, and iT

= 0.

The behavior of v in this case satisfies

g + v =

(22)

so d =

(1+r)1

(1+5/2) bt -

bt

[(l+5/2)(l+5)-1 l] bt = -(5/2)(l+5)

b

g + v is negative and decays at the rate 5/2. The alterna-

tive (conventional) deficit measure

=

dt + Sbt

is positive, however,

and grows at the rate 5/2. Thus we see that the conventionallydefined deficit can--in the Ricardian/monetarist Sidrauskj model--

grow forever without causing inflation. Furthermore, we see that the
real stock of bonds can grow forever at a rate exceedthg zero--which
is, in this instance, the growth rate of the economy.

It appears, furthermore, that the foregoing conclusions are not

necessarily affected by population growth. Specifically, suppose that
as in Sidrauski (1967) the size of each household grows at the rate n
and that the utility function remains as in (2) with c and

now

measuring per-capita values. Then, with all other quantities also
expressed in per-capita terms, the household budget constraint..becomes

+ (l+n)(l+r)

One relevant effect is that the counterpart of (7) now implies that

(l+n)(l+r)1 =

(l+ô)1

if bt > 0 and

=

+1

Another is that

condition (lOb) is replaced with

(lOb') urn
T-*

bT÷l

T-l X( n)/(1+r) = 0.

In addition, the government budget identity becomes, in per-capita
terms,

(12')

(l÷n)(l+Trt)m1 -

m +

(l+n)(l+r) —l

bt÷l -

Consequently, if the per-capita magnitudes

bt

= g

+ Vt.

v, and Mt are

held constant over time--so that the aggregate deficit d and money stock
each grow at the rate n in every period--the following equation will
14/

govern the behavior of b under the monetarist hypothesis:

(14')

bt+l =

(l+r)(l) b

+ (d-)(l+r)(l).

Thus the per-capita bond stock grows at the rate (1+r)(l+n)

-1.

But since l+r equals (l+n)(1+'5) in the hypothesized steady state,

bT+l then grows at the rate Ô which equals the rate at which 3Tl

contracts. So the product bT÷l T-l grows at the rate zero. This
violates (lOb) as in our first example with n =

0.

But it just

violates (lob), so it is clear that the second and third examples,
in which the per-capita bond stock grows at a diminishing rate that
approaches zero and at a constant rate less than 6 (respectively),

15

will not violate (lOb').
Allowing proportional depreciation of capital would leave the
crucial relationship between 6 and the growth rate of bonds unchanged.

The marginal product of capital would exceed r by the amount of the
depreciation rate, but the steady-state condition 1+r =

(l+6)(l+n)

would continue to hold and it is the relationship between r and 8

that governs the relative growth rates of bT÷l and T-l
From the cases considered, then, we reach the following con-

clusions regarding bond-financed deficits in a Ricardian/monetarist
economy:
(i)

A permanent per-capita deficit cannot be financed solely

with bonds if the deficit is defined exclusive of interest payments.
(ii)

A permanent per-capita deficit can be financed solely with

bonds, and without inflation, if the deficit is defined inclusive of
interest payments.

(iii) It is feasible to maintain a positive growth rate of real
bonds per capita, but this growth rate must be smaller than the rate of
time preference.

If output grows only as a result of population growth, the per-capita

growth rates in these three statements can be interpreted as aggregate
15 /

growth

rates measured relative to aggregate output growth.

16

Instability

IV.

with a Friedman-Type Policy Rule

exists a sizeable body of literature concerning potential
"instability" under a policy regime in which taxes are collected
according to a proportional (or progressive) schedule, rather than in
There

a Lump-sum fashion. In particular, authors including Blinder and
Solow (1976),

have

Christ (1979), Scarth (1980), Turnovsky (1977) and others

argued that the macroeconomic system will exhibit dynamic in-

stability due to explosive bond growth if the government adopts a policy

regime of the type championed by Milton Friedman (1968): one that

the money

makes

of government spending or income tax schedules. This diffi-

responsas

culty

stock grow at a constant rate and prohibits endogeneous

arises, it should

designed

be emphasized, even when these schedules are

to yield a balanced budget in the steady state. From the

analysis of Section III it appears that explosive behavior of the

bond stock would indeed prevent the attainment of equilibrium, so an
examination of the issue seems warranted,

For this analysis we shall retain the model of Section III, but now

assume that (proportional) taxes are levied at the rate ¶ on production
and interest received from the government. In per-capita terms, real

taxes during period t are then r[f(k) +

For simplicity,

ri be].

let the transfer component of v be zero. Then the per-capita

government budget identity becomes

(23)

(l+n)(l.fr)m1 =

- T[f(k)

+

(l+n)(1+r)1 b1 -

Now we impose the Friedman policy rule by requiring M and

to be

17

constant over time, and we hypothesize the existence of a steady state
with constant values of

kt, arid P. Under those assumptions, (23)

reduces to

(l+n)(l+r) b÷i - bt =

It is also assumed that 1

set at a zagnitude that permits b to

remain constant at some chosen value. But if bt ever departs from
that value, its behavior will be described by

b+i =

(25)

(l+r)(l-Tr)(l+ct)

b + constant
17/

so that dynamic stability prevails only if (l+r)(l-'rr) < (l+i).

To see whether that condition would obtain in the monetarist
steady state, we next

examine the household's choice problem under the

revised

budget constraint, which is

Using the strict equality in the latter, we then see that a steady

(29)

with positive

bond holdings implies

(l+r)(l-Tr) =

(1+ri)(l).

18

Consequently, we see that (l+r)(l-rr) >

so that (25) is dynamically

And the relevant transversality condition is again

so that path is not an equilibrium. Thus the analysis implies that the
Friedman rule is unsatisfactory in the following sense: any departure
of b from its intended constant value will place the system on an
t

18/

infeasible path.

The foregoing argument contradicts the conjecture in McCallum
(1981, p.137), where it is suggested that the presence of growth and

taxes would tend to produce stability in the behavior of bonds per unit

of output. In that paper an equation similar to (25) is utilized, but
it is suggested that r would tend to equal n in the steady state. Here
we see that suggestion to be incorrect: in the present model, the aftertax real rate of interest is approximately equal to the rate of growth, a,
plus the rate of time preference, 6.

Consequently, the suggestion in the last paragraph of McCallum (1981)

assumes a heightened importance. In order to implement a non-discretionary
and

non-activist set of monetary and fiscal policy rules,

as is often

recommended

by Friedman and other monetarists, it would seem to be prefer-

able to

the growth rate of

set

3, rather

than Mt at some constant value.

With a fixed tax schedule and a fixed path for

cyclically-induced

deficits and surpluses would then be automatically financed by changes

in the stock of money. From the perspective of dynamic stability, the
"monetary and fiscal framework" originally proposed by Milton Friedman
(1948) appears to be superior to the one promoted in his later writings
(1959)

(1968).

19

The observation of the last paragraph, that Friedman originally
proposed a constant bond-growth rule, leads one naturally to ask what led

to his change of position. The only explanation I have been able to
find in Friedman's writings is as follows:
I have become increasingly persuaded that

the [1948] proposal

is more sophisticated and complex than is necessary, that
a much simpler rule would also produce
results and would have two great

highly satisfactory

advantages: first, its

simplicity would facilitate the public understanding and
backing that is necessary if the rule is to provide an
effective barrier to opportunistic

"tinkering"; second, it

would

largely separate the monetary problem from the fiscal
and hence would require less far-reaching reform over a narrower

area. (Friedman, 1959, p.90)
From this I would infer that Friedman's

change in position resulted not

from economic considerations but from a belief that it would be easier,
politically, to achieve adoption of the money-stock rule in the United

States. In particular, less cooperation between the monetary and fiscal
authorities would be required. But

is not conducive to effective

monetary control, and that improved per-

formance probably requires termination of the independence of the Fed,
this rationale for the second-best rule seems less satisfactory.

Measures of the Deficit
Previous sections have mentioned two possible definitions of the real

deficit, dt =

+

v

and the more conventional cI =

÷v

Rtl.

+

(Here we ignore population growth.) Recently, a number of writers

have

suggested that a more appropriate concept would be the change in the real

value of the government's liabilities. Thus the suggested definition is

m1 - m + b1
=g t +vt -b t Rt-l

(30) d =

-

-ii(m
t
t+l

+bt+l),

which subtracts from the conventional measure the capital gains to the

government (losses to the public) that result from inflation. This concept
incorporates an entirely sensible adjustment, one that helps to produce a

measure that more accurately reflects real resource flows between the

government and the private sector. There are, however, two points that
need to be made concerning the measure
First, if one is discussing a Ricardian economy it seems inappropriate
to include the bond component

-

As the discussion in Sections II

and III indicates, changes in b or b unaccompanied by changes in N or g
have no effects on private supplies or demands in this type of economy.
Such changes do not, therefore, give rise to resource transfers to or from

the government. And from the balance sheet point of view, changes in b
that have no effect on private wealth--as the Ricardian result is often
expressed--should not be regarded as altering the liabilities of the

government. In a Ricardian economy, therefore, a better measure of the
real deficit would seem to be

21

d**
=mt+1-m,t
t

(31)
the

change between periods t

and t+l in the real value of the stock of

(high-powered) money. The difference in treatment between bonds and money
implied by this definition is appropriate because changes in real money
holdings do, in contrast with those for bonds, give rise to supply-demand

adjustments and resource transfers. In the Sidrauski setup these come
about because m is an argument of u. More fundamentally, the idea is

that transaction cost economies provided by holdings of the medium of exchange
alter the consumption/leisure possibilities faced by individual agents.

The second point to be made applies to d as well as d--indeed, it
is most transparent in an economy in which there are no bonds.. There the

point is that d*, i.e., the period-t change in real money balances
-

cn.

is not a useful measure of the inflationary impact of the period's

fiscal/monetary actions. It is the percentage change in nominal money
balances (corrected for output growth, of course) that measures the in-

flationary potential of those actions. As is familiar from discussions of
hyperinflationary experiences, real money balances will generally be falling
over time during periods of increasing inflation rates, even though the
inflation is entirely due to increasing rates of growth of nominal money

stocks. Alternatively, the measure d* will obviously equal zero in an
inflationary steady-state, whatever the rate of inflation.

Turning to economies with money and bonds, we first note that if the
**
*
economy is Ricardian, d is preferred to d and the argument is just as

above. If, on the other hand, the economy is not Ricardian, the inflationary
impact of a given percentage change in M+B will depend upon the mix of money

and bonds. Thus no single measure will be fully adequate. If one

22

nevertheless seeks a single measure, a natural point of reference is provided by the case of equiproportionate issues of N and B, in which case

the ratio of N to B does not change. In that case the point is that

d is not a good measure of the inflationary impact of the N-plus-B
issue, even if scaled and corrected for output growth. The basic reason
is the same as for the no-bonds economy; it is the groth of N-I-B, not

m+b, that is relevant for the generation of inflation.

VI. Reagan Administration Plans
Let us now briefly attempt to determine whether the results of
Section iii imply that the

monetary and fiscal policy plans of the

Reagan administration__as of early l982--are

inconsistent, in the sense

of requiring an infeasible path for the stock of government bonds.
The values of the planned federal

budget

announced by the Council of Economic Advisers

deficits for 1982-87
(1982, p.98) are as

follows:

Here we see that, although the deficit

magnitudes are large by historic

standards, they decrease each year as a fraction of GNP. Thus the

deficits as forecast by the CEA do not imply monetary-fiscal inconsistency, even if per-capita money growth is taken to be negligible.
But of course these forecasts are
forecast values of output and
for those variables are highly

sensitively dependent upon the

inflation, and the CEA's forecast values

optimistic. In the following table, the

output growth and inflation values forecast by the CEA are compared with
"assumptions" used by the Congressional

Budget Office (CBO) in preparing

its "Baseline Budget Projections" (1982, p.6):

This difference in assumptions about macroeconomic per formance
leads to large discrepancies in deficit forecasts, even with similar
assumptions regarding spending rules and tax schedules.

The CBO's

baseline projection for deficits is as follows:

5.0

5.0

Here the deficit does not fall, as time passes, as a percent of GNP.
Furthermore, the CBO describes alternative projections based on relatively
"optimistic" and "pessimistic't assumptions regarding output and inflation.

Under the latter alternative, the deficit increases steadily in relation
to GNP, reaching 7.47. in 1987 (CBO, pp.15-16).

From the foregoing discussion it seems clear that it is difficult to
be confident about the inconsistency possibility, one way or the other.

And of course the relevant transversality conditions in our model apply
only in the limit so, strictly speaking, six years of forecasts can not

25

be conclusive whatever the magnitudes. Perhaps the best way to think of
the issue, consequently, is as follows. The tax legislation embodied by
the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 is scheduled to introduce

indexing

in 1985, thereby eliminating "bracket creep" resulting from inflation.

In addition, progressivity was markedly reduced. As a first approximation,
then, one might view the relevant tax structure for the period beginning
in 1985 as one in which a constant fraction of real output is collected

by the Federal government in taxes. The crucial issue, then, is whether
government spending will be similarly curtailed. If, instead, spending
rises as a fraction of output, inconsistency would result.

26

VII.

Conclusions
To a certain extent, the analytical results described above provide

support for the monetarist position. In particular, we have seen that
it is possible to construct a utility-maximizing model in which bondfinanced deficits are not inflationary if the bond stock does not grow

too rapidly. Furthermore, the model's restriction on bond growth permits
a permanently-maintained, positive per-capita deficit, provided that the
deficit is measured (as is conventional) as inclusive of interest

payments. And the model places no upper bound on the ratio of bonds to
output.

On the other hand, it is also true that the model places strict limits
on the extent of bond sales, and these limits imply that a constant noninflationary per-capita deficit is not feasible if the deficit is measured

exclusive of interest payments. These limits obtain, moreover, in a model
that is designed to be highly sympathetic to the monetarist position. Thus
21/

the results are not unreservedly supportive of the aionetarist position.

In addition, it is shown that when a zero per-capita money stock growth
rule is combined with a constant per-capita level of government purchases
and a constant proportional tax schedule, the implied behavior of the bond

is dynamically infeasible. If this Friedman-type policy rule is
considered "monetarist," then an additional unsupportive result is obtained.
stock

In

any event, the analysis suggests that Friedman's original proposal (1948)--

in which bond growth is held constant and money issued or returned over the
cycle to satisfy the government budget identity--is superior to the one
promoted in his more recent writings.

Appendix
The object here is to describe in more detail the derivation of the
optituality conditions for the individual household. We take the most
general conditions described in the body of the paper, those in which

the household's population grows at the rate n and taxes are imposed on
income. Thus the objective function is (2) and the budget constraint (26).
We begin with a version in which the household has a planning horizon of

T periods. Thus the relevant Lagrangian expression is

L

(A-l)

It

[u(ct,mt)

(l-4-n)(l+rT )m

is assumed that u and f have properties such that the Kuhn-Tucker con-

ditions are necessary and sufficient for a maximum. These are:

t =

Here the first three are written as equalities because the household will
choose positive magnitudes for

m÷1, and kt1 for t =

1,... ,T-l.

The

optimal value for some be's may be zero, however, so the two-part condition

28

is required. Also relevant are values of mT+l, kT÷l, arid bT+l. The
household would like each of these to be negative (and large in absolute

value) but non-negativity requirements pertain. Thus we have the twopart conditions:

(A6) _T-1 XT

XT(l+iiT)(1i-n) =

XT(l+n) = 0

T-1 XT(l+rT) (1÷n) = 0.

Finally, to obtain conditions for the infinite-horizon assumption we
let

In this case (A-2)-(A-5) become applicable for all t =

1,2,...

while (A—6)—(A-8) hold in the limit. In the body, the first parts of
(A-6) and (A-7) are ignored, since with

> 0 they will be satisfied

automatically. By setting n = 0 and ¶ = 0, the above conditions collapse
to those presented in (4)-(l0). Also applicable, of course, are the
budget constraints relevant for each t = 1,2

Many of there are included in Gordon (1974) and Stein (1976). The models

typically

assume that consumption or private expenditure depends directly upon private wealth,

with government debt included as a component of the latter. See, for example, Brunner
and Meltzer (1976, p. 72). In these models, then, a bond-financed tax reduction
directly increases aggregate demand.

2. This statement presumes that intergenerational transfers are operative. A discussion
of ciretmistances under which Barro's result is inapplicable is provided by Drazen(].978)

3. Recall that the analysis is intended to determine whether a case can reasonably be
made for the monetarist position.

4. My own arguments appear in McCallum (1980).
5. Barro (1974) (1981) argues that neglect of these complicating features does not serve
to distort the results in a predictable direction.

6. This assumption, it should be noted, plays an important role in the Sargent-c.iallace
analysis.

7. Irrelevance of continued bond growth is assumed, without

any utility-maximizing

justification, in McCalluin (1978).

8. The Sidrauski model is, of course, one in which bonds and money can easily co-exist
because real money balances appear as an argument of the household's within-period

utility function. The rationale for this appearance--which has been severely
criticized by Bryant and Wallace (1980) and others--is that transaction costs are
reduced by money balances, so that more preferred bundles of consumption and

leisure can be obtained. For a rather lengthy discussion of related issues, see
McCallum (1982).

9. A notable feature of the Sidrauski model is the invariance of the steady-state
capital-labor ratio to expected inflation rates. This invariance (or superneutrality) does not survive minor modifications, such as making utility

dependent upon leisure. It is my impression that the superneutrality
property is not crucial for the issues under discussion here; the superneutral
version of the model has been adopted for simplicity.

10. The limiting procedure is a modification of one described by Sargent (1979,
pp. 333-335).

In this experiment (and those that follow) it is assumed that steady-state
values for k and in prevail in period 1. Since the crucial aspects of the
analysis involve limiting conditions, this simplification seems adequate for
the issues at hand.

12. It is true, as Gray and Salant (1981) have recently emphasized, that there are
some problems for which transversality conditions such as (lOb) are not

necessary for optimality. That the proposed path cannot be an equilibrium in
the case at hand can nevertheless be verified by observing that the representative household could, in any period, reduce its bond holdings to zero

and obtain extra consumption in that period without reducing consumption in
any other period (and without altering any value of

Under that hypothesis, the inflation rate will be zero.

remain valid in cases in which steady-state growth is possible. That the

implied by the analysis of the next section.
