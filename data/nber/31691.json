    "abstract": "\n\nMoral hazard and provider-induced demand may contribute to overutilization of scarce health care resources. The U.S. health care system includes several compensatory cost-containment mechanisms, but their effects depend on how patients and providers respond. We investigate hospice programs\u2019 responses to a cap in the Medicare hospice benefit on their average annual payments per patient. We estimate their intensive margin responses to the cap by leveraging variation in cap-related financial incentives generated by the policy\u2019s nonlinear design and the transition between fiscal years. We find that programs on track to exceed the cap in the last three months of a fiscal year raise their enrollment rates by 5.7% and their live discharge rates by 4.3% on average, reducing their cap liabilities. The marginal enrollees have longer average remaining lifetimes and are less likely to have been recently hospitalized. Their hospice spells are also more likely to be fragmented by subsequent live discharges. On the extensive margin, we find that cap liabilities are associated with terminations of Medicare provider certification numbers, suggesting that the cap impacts market structure. Current policy discussions about reducing the cap should consider its potential effect on market structure.\n\n",
