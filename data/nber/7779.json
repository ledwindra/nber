    "abstract": "\n\nOur framework for evaluating and investing in mutual funds combines observed returns on funds and passive assets with prior beliefs that distinguish pricing-model inaccuracy from managerial skill.  A fund's  alpha' is defined using passive benchmarks.  We show that returns on non-benchmark passive assets help estimate that alpha more precisely for most funds.  The resulting estimates generally vary less than standard estimates across alternative benchmark specifications.  Optimal portfolios constructed from a large universe of equity funds can include actively managed funds even when managerial skill is precluded. The fund universe offers no close substitutes for the Fama-French and momentum benchmarks.\n\n",
