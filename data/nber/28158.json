    "abstract": "\n\nConcerned about the low academic ability of public school teachers, in the 1990s and 2000s, some states increased licensing stringency to weed out low-quality candidates, while others decreased restrictions to attract high-quality candidates. We offer a theoretical model justifying both reactions. Using data from 1991\u20132007 on licensing requirements and teacher quality\u2014as measured by the selectivity of teachers\u2019 undergraduate institutions\u2014we find that stricter licensing requirements, especially those emphasizing academic coursework, increase the left tail of the quality distribution for secondary school teachers without significantly decreasing quality for high-minority or high-poverty districts.\n\n",
