Optimal Price Adjustment with Time—Dependent Costs

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to analyze an optimal pricing rule for the
case in which the costs of price adjustment are time dependent, and where
those costs depend positively on the magnitude of the percentage price

change. By means of discrete time model, it is shown that the optimal
response to the problem under consideration is to pre—set prices for each

period at the end of the previous period. Within the period prices will
adjust if the unexpected shock exceeds a threshold level. En such a case the
new price is established at a level that is a weighted average of the pre—set
level and of the equilibrium level that would have obtained in the absence of

costs of contemporaneous price adjustment. Under certain conditions, which
are derived in the paper, higher volatility of unexpected inflation might
reduce relative price volatility.

Introduction and Summary

In a recent paper Sheshinski and Weiss (1983) have analyzed the optimal

price adjustment rule for a producer having market power and facing a fixed

cost of price adjustment. Their contribution has demonstrated that the
adjustment rule is of the (S, s) type, and that higher volatility of inflation

would accompany a higher volatility of relative prices. The purpose of the
present paper is to analyze optimal pricing rules for the case where the costs
of price adjustment are time dependent, and where those costs depend

positively on the magnitude of the percentage price change. Two economic
considerations motivate these modifications. First, we expect that the cost
of an unexpected price adjustment would exceed that of a price adjustment that
is anticipated well ahead of time, because in the latter case more time is

available to adjust plans. Next, as Rotemberg (1982) has argued '...under
imperfect information consumers will tend to cater to firms with relatively
stable price paths and avoid those firms which change their prices often and

by large amounts...". Thus, the presumption is that consumers benefit from a
more stable price structure. We capture this notion by imposing costs of
price adjustment that depend on the magnitude of the price change.

Rotemberg (1982) and Sheshinski and Weiss (1983) postulate costs of price

adjustment that are time independent. This paper modifies their analysis by
assessing how time—dependent costs of price adjustment modify the pricing

behavior of a producer. By means of a discrete time model, is shown that for
the case analyzed in the paper optimal behavior requires pre—setting prices

for each period at their certainty—equivalence level. Within the period,

—1—

prices will adjust if the unexpected price—level change exceeds a threshold

value. When this happens, the price moves to a level that corresponds to a
weighted average of the pre—set prices and the price that would have obtained

in the absence of costs of contemporaneous price adjustment. The weights and
the threshold value justifying price adjustment have a simple representation

as functions of the underlying parameters. Unlike the case analyzed by
Sheshinski and Weiss (1983), under certain conditions higher volatility of

unexpected inflation might reduce relative price volatility.1 Necessary
conditions are high volatility of inflation and small marginal costs of price
adjustment.

The analysis also demonstrates that the elasticity of price volatility

with respect to inflation volatility exceeds one. The reason for both results
is that higher inflation volatility leads to more frequent contemporaneous
price adjustment.

The paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 describes the
model, Section 3 derives the optimal pricing rule. Section 4 offers
concluding remarks. The Appendix summarizes the notation used in the paper.

2. The Model
Starting with the case in which prices are fully flexible provides us

with a benchmark for subsequent discussion. Flexible prices occur if the cost
of contemporaneous price changes is nil, and if consumers attach no value to

price stability. Consider in such an economy a producer of good x facing a
demand for his product given by

P

correspond to the price level and the price of good x in

period t. The producer is facing a given price level. To simplify
exposition, the analysis is conducted for the case where marginal costs of

production are zero. The approach described In the paper can be applied also
for the case where labor Is a variable input.
Direct optimization reveals that the equilibrium price is given by:

We

would like to introduce price rigidity by using a modified version of

Rotetnberg's (1982) framework. Like Rotemberg, we assume two types of costs.

One is a fixed cost per price change, denoted by c. The other is a cost that
relates to the reputation of the seller. The presumption is that consumers

benefit from a more stable price structure. We capture this notion by
Imposing a cost that is quadratic in the percentage change of prices. Unlike
Rotemberg (1982) and SheshInski and Weiss (1983), we assume that costs of

price adjustment are time dependent. The presumption is that changes in
prices that are known well ahead of time would impose lesser adjustment costs
than unexpected, last minute changes because in the former case there is more

time to adjust plans. This assumption is a natural extension of the notion
that unexpected inflation imposes higher adjustment costs and welfare loss
than anticipated inflation.

A simple way of introducing these considerations

iS to

assume that price

changes for period t are costless if they are made ahead of time (i.e., before

period t). Price changes impose costs if they are made within the period (at

time t), because they can not be foreseen (at time t1).
In such an environment the producer pre—sets prices for period t at the

end of period t-1, at a (logarithmic) level p .

adjusted within the period to p , under a flexible equilibrium profits would
be rr(p').

Because within—the—period price adjustment imposes costs, we

should adjust profits rr(p) by the costs of price adjustment. Those costs
are the fixed cost, c, and depend also on the magnitude of the percentage

change. This is captured by the quadratic term (p0 —

3. Optimal Pricing Policy

Optimal pricing policy should provide us with three rules: the optimal
price to change if we decide to make a price adjustment within the period

(p); the switching conditions under which we would update prices within the

period; and the optimal pre—set price (p). We derive the policy in three

corresponding steps. First, for a given p we derive optimal p .

Next,

for a given p and the corresponding optimal value of p we find the
conditions under which we would decide to update the price of x within the

period (optimal switching rule). Lastly, subject to optimal p and the
optimal switching rule, we find the optimal value of p° •

We

then use the

optimal pricing rule to study the properties of the resulting variances of the

Next, notice that we would adjust prices contemporaneously if

The price of x for period t is pre—set at the end of the previous period
at its certainty—equivalence level (i.e., at the level that would maximize

profits if the value of c is zero). If the unexpected price level change
exceeds a threshold value,2 the price of x adjusts within the period to level
p' .

The threshold value depends positively on the cost of within—the—period

price adjustment (both the fixed and the marginal cost). It depends
negatively on a measure of the cost of price divergence from its optimal value

We can now derive a measure of unexpected relative price adjustment.

If the price of x is pre—set, the shock to the relative price Is equal to

the aggregate price level shock. Allowing the price of x to adjust within the
period cushions the shock to relative prices by

1 —w =w

(15)

The greater is the cost of price divergence (112)

and the lower the marginal

cost of price adjustment, the greater the cushioning effect. To assess how
higher unexpected inflation volatility affects relatIve prIce volatIlIty let

us impose further structure on the model by assuming that c follows a normal

distribution. Let

4(c)

and c) denote the standard normal density

function and cumulative distribution of c, and V

denote the variance

and standard deviation of y. From equation 14 we obtain that the volatility
of relative prices is:

A higher volatility of unexpected inflation (dV > 0) has two opposite
effects. The direct effect increases relative price volatility at the rate of
the increase in inflation volatility. At the same time, however, higher
inflation volatility implies that the price of x would adjust more frequently
within the period (i.e., more frequently

> k).

Because such an

adjustment cushions the shock to relative prices, higher inflation volatility

would indirectly work to reduce volatility. In terms of equatIon 16,

and that 0 < 11(z) < 1J. From equation 16 we obtain that

if

z > 1.36

if z < 1,36.

Thus, for stable economies the effect of higher inflation volatility on

relative price volatility is unambiguously positive, (i.e., If a < k/1e36).
This Is because the direct volatility effect dominates the cushioning effect

of more frequent price adjustment. In terms of equation 17, both terms are
positives For economies where the volatility of inflation is high enough,

however, the second term in equation 17 is negative (i.e., If a > k/1,36).
Under certain conditions it might even dominate the first term, resulting In a
region where a higher inflation volatility accompanies a lower relative price

volatility. To obtain this result the cushioning effect w of price
adjustment should be adequately powerful. Inspection of equation 17 reveals
that higher unexpected inflation volatility would reduce relative price
volatility if and only if both the marginal cost of price adjustment are small
enough, and the inflation rate is sufficiently volatile.4
Using equations 6, 8' we can obtain also that price volatility Is given

Concluding Remarks

Our discussion demonstrates that considering the possibility of time
dependent costs of price adjustment allows us to focus on the cushioning

effect of within—the period price adjustment. This effect reduces the
magnitude of relative price volatility. Under certain conditions it might
result in a drop in relative price volatility as a result of higher inflation

volatility. These conditions seem restrictive enough to prevent aggregate
analysis from revealing the importance of the cushioning effect. Our analysis
suggests that the price behavior will vary across economies and sectors
according to the degree of competition, the costs of price adjustment, the
volatility of the inflationary process.
