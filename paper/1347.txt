The Inefficiency of Marginal—cost Pricing
and the Apparent Rigidity of Prices
ABSTRACT

Under conditions of natural monopoly, private contracts or
government regulation may attempt to avoid inefficiency by

setting up a pricing formula. Once the capital stock is chosen,

the right price to charge the buyer is marginal cost. But the
point of this paper is that marginal—cost pricing provides the
wrong incentives + or the choice of the capital stock by the
seller.

If the seller can achieve a high price by deliberately

under—investing and driving up marginal cost, there will be a

systematic tendency toward too small a capital stock. One type
a-f contract or regulatory policy that avoids this problem charges

marginal cost to each buyer, but provides a revenue to the seller
that is equal to long—run unit cost, not short—run marginal cost.
Such a contract or policy will make the price, in the sense of
the revenue of the seller per unit of output, appear to be
unresponsive to market conditions.

Setting price equal to marginal cost can be inefficient.
Marginal cost prices provide the correct allocation of the output

from a fixed amount of capital, but may provide the wrong
incentives for capital accumulation.
When a seller receives
marginal cost, it has an incentive to raise marginal cost by
investing too little.

Contracts can circumvent the conflict between the need

for

efficient allocation of output among buyers, which seems to call
for marginal—cost pricing, and the need for efficient investment,

efficient contracts has some extra advantages and fits the facts

about output and revenue.

Under this contract, revenue is

strictly proportional to output, or, to put it another way, the

"price," in the sense of revenue per Linit of output, is
predetermined by the contract (possibly it is indexed to observed
input costs). Price rigidity is a feature a-f the contract.

Prices are thought to be important signals about

the current state of the economy.

For example, the performance

of labor contracts is much better if they can be indexed to the

prices at which goods are actually bought and sold.

But if

government price indexes report unit revenue, and unit revenue is

stabilized for the reason laid out here, then the value of those
price indexes in contingent contracts is much reduced.

The inefficiency of marginal—cost pricing is not completely
unknown in the literature on efficient regulation.

Private managements would have a

times of strong demand, hoping instead to enjoy the
high profits resulting from the high prices required
to ration customers.

Kahn mentions earlier work of James Bonbright (1961), which
contains a brief statement of the point and cites Bruce Knight

(1930), as the originator.

But Knights paper does not really

distinguish between the obvious problem of letting a monopoly

utility set its own price unilaterally and the more subtle
problem of a rule requiring price to equal marginal cost.

In

Jacques Drezes review of the contributions of French applied
economists (1964), there is a brief discussion of the incentives
facing the firm subject to marginal—cost pricing, but it reaches

the incorrect conclusion that private and social optimality
coincide.

tne problem of

inappropriate incentives for investment under marginal cost
pricing, but all of his analysis deals with a public agency that

avoids the problem by adopting consumer surplus rather than

As far

in the 1970s takes Walters' view and is completely silent on the
issue of investment incentives.

fell to its troughs in 1958 and 1961, prices fell somewhat. When
output began its spectacular long rise from 1961 to 1966, prices

continued to decline relative to costs. The fall in output from
1969 to 1971 saw a small increase in the price—cost ratio.

In

the later 1970s, the movement of prices is influenced by energy
costs, which are not considered here. Even so, there is no sign
of movement along an upward—sloping marginal cost schedule.

In

1982, when output fell to its lowest point in the entire period,
prices continued to rise relative to costs.

Data for the steel industry are drawn from Robert Crandall 's

(1981) study of the economics of steel.

Price is measured as

revenue divided by output for a single homogeneous product, cold—

rolled sheet.

Cost is a detailed index of all components of

steel costs. Again, there is no systematic tendency for price to
rise relative to cost in booms or fall in periods of low output.

From 1956 to 1958, steel output fell by 23 percent, while price
rose a little relative to cost.

From a trough in 1970 to a peak

in 1973, steel output rose by 44 percent, yet the price fell
significantly relative to cost.

These data strongly support the hypothesis that prices are
closely linked to factor costs and hardly linked to short—run

marginal cost at all.

The rest of the paper investigates hy

contracts might have exactly this feature and yet provide the
efficient allocation of output and the efficient level of the

3. Contract provisions to provide the efficient capital stock

What is distinctive and complex about the setup considered in
this paper is the investment decision made by the producer after

contracts are signed.

The total revenue from all its contracts

provides an investment incentive to the firm, and the contracts

must be designed to provide the right incentive in order to
achieve capital efficiency.

There is one minor obstacle to contracting for exact capital
efficiency.

As a general matter, the information available to

the firm at investment time, indexed by u, may convey more than

The revenue -Formula R(Q,K,w,r) is homogeneous of degree
one in Q and K.

It will turn out to be reasonable to consider contracts

in

which the quantity choices of the purchasers influence the
producer's revenue only through total quantity and not

through

the vector o-f quantities chosen separately by each purchaser. In

this case, the revenue of the producer is a function R(Q,K,w,r).
The producer chooses K to maximize expected profit,

The derivative of revenue with respect to output is just the
price, which equals marginal cost. Therefore the first two terms
in the criterion for capital efficiency cancel each

other.

All

that is left is the third term, the derivative of revenue with
respect to the capital stock.

This must equal zero for capital

efficiency. However, with marginal—cost pricing, that derivative
is

which is negative, not zero.

The larger is the capital

stock, the lower is the price——more capital lowers marginal cost.

Profit maximization cannot bring the firm to the efficient stock.
This conclusion is summarized in

Theorem 4. Under marginal—cost pricing,

expected profit is

a strictly decreasing function of the capital stock, at the
efficient capital stock.

15

Besides marginal—cost pricing, two other simple revenue
functions deserve mention because they are inefficient.

One is

to let revenue equal cost

This revenue

function satisfies the marginal conditions for

capital efficiency but not the second order conditions.

The

producer has profit of zero no matter what, and so is indifferent

among all levels of K. the purchasers would have to develop some
method outside the revenue function to steer the producer to the
efficient capital stock.

Another choice is to make revenue independent of either
output or capital- At first, this seems like the right approach.

The two parties want the producer to pick the efficient capital
stock so as to minimize the expected cost of producing whatever
level of output the purchasers decide to take. Maximizing profit

might then seem to be equivalent to minimizing cost.

But the

firm influences the level of output through its choice of the
capital stock, even though the purchasers have the unilateral
power to choose the amount of output. For constant revenue,

which is unambiguously negative. The firm faces an inappropriate
disincentive to invest because it is not rewarded for the cost of
producing the extra output stimulated by extra capital.

Though none of the three revenue formulas considered so far
provides the right investment incentives, the marginal condition

for capital efficiency is not actually very restrictive.

A particularly interesting and simple way to provide the

This formula provides no direct reward for investment but can

The roughness comes

from the treatment of uncertainty——the weighted average of
marginal cost takes exact account of the cost of meeting the
producer's commitment to meet variable demand.

If the notion of

long—run average cost is modified to take account o-f the cost of

the variability, then the principle of setting short—run unit
revenue equal to long—run unit cost is an appropriate one.

In

the related context of peak—load pricing. Boiteux (1949) showed
that the average marginal cost should equai long—run unit cost.

The problem faced by the designers of contracts (or by the

regulator) is to find a way to give the producer long—run
marginal cost while at the same time charging the buyers short—

run marginal cost.

When there are many buyers, a contract form

with precisely the right characteristics is

available, as the

next section will show.

4. Contracts to provide both output and capital efficiency

The type of contract considered in this paper is most at
home when one producer sells to many buyers.

When the buyers

have the unilateral power to determine the quantities they take,
the producer need not be concerned with the circumstances of each

of the many purchasers.

Instead, the producer should offer a

standardized contract to each buyer.

This section shows that

such contracts can provide both output and

capital efficiency.

Key to the functioning of the contracts is the notion that each

buyer is small enough so that its purchases do not

affect

marginal cost. Efficiency is approximate in exactly the same way
that the efficiency of competitive equilibrium is

The approximate concept of

output efficiency is expressed in

A contract is output—efficient for a small

purchaser if

A(q,Q,K,w,r) =

That is, the purchaser pays marginal cost for q1, but the
role of qi in total output, Q, is ignored.

This definition saves some tedious arguments later, none of
which is a departure from the same development of the efficiency
of competitive equilibrium.

Output efficiency restricts the form of the standardized
contract:

How does the standardized contract for multiple purchasers

accomplish its goal?

In effect, charging a purchaser only for

the departure of its purchase from its share of total output
makes the N—i other purchasers function as a third party to the
contract between the purchaser and the seller.

When demand is

strong, customers face high prices in the allocational sense, but

the revenue from those high prices flows to the customers as a
group, not to the producer.

In this way, the producer does not

face the incentive to create chronic shortages by investing in

too little capital.

parallel contract in the labor market, where the other employees

firm and one employee.

The potential role of third parties in

In words, the purchaser and the producer agree on a normal share

If the purchaser elects to take exactly its

normal share, it pays long—run unit cost.

Departures from the

normal share are priced at current marginal cost.

Total revenue

from all customers is long—run unit cost times output, and is
independent of the capital stock.

though

realized marginal cost are tricky, because customers may not be
able to verify capacity utilization rates.

It seems to me that

the basic lesson from this investigation is the importance of

stabilizing the revenue of the firm in the appropriate way
against tight conditions.

The customer must be assured that the

firm cant profit by underinvesting.

The allocation of output

when demand is strong is a subsidiary issue, and not necessarily
one that must be handled by explicit marginal—cost pricing.

As

Dennis Carlton (1978) has noted, suppliers in intermediate—
product markets are often deeply involved in deciding UPOfl

the

Output is allocated among

customerE when supplies are short, not soid to the highest
bidder.

Stabilizing

unit revenue is not the only way to provide the

right investment incentives to the firm.

Total revenue could be

made independent of the level of output and positively related to

the amount of capital. But then the "price"——unit revenue of the
firm——would be negatively related to output. Though the evidence

strongly favors stable unit revenue over marginal cost, it does
not go so far as to suggest declining unit revenue in good times.

To put it another way, profits do decline in recessions, though
not by as much as theywould with marginal—cost pricing.

In effect, output efficiency says the level of

In this respect, the study of contracts in

product markets reaches the same conclusion as the closely
related study of contracts in labor markets——there are good
reasons -for the parties to stabilize the flow of payments from
one party to the other, but no reason to expect disequilibrium or

inefficiency just because the flow is stabilized.

There is

little doubt that disequilibrium is a major feature of the
economy, but no reason to think that the price and wage rigidity

associated with long—term contracts is a direct contributor to
disequilibrium.

It is probably reasonable to interpret most government price

held perfectly stable, relative to input costs, then price
indexes are deprived of much of their value in signalling the
25

current state of the economy.

If prices tracked marginal cost,

and so fell during

recessions and rose during booms, they would convey information
in a highly usable way to agents elsewhere in the economy.

For

example, labor contracts are often contingent on prices, but the

unresponsiveness of prices over the business cycle prevents the
contingency from offsetting the parallel shifts in the demand for
labor.

Employment fluctuations might well be smaller (and more

efficient) if prices were closer to marginal cost..

In this

respect, the need to stabilize revenue to provide the correct

incentives for investcent may indirectly contribute to macro
disequilibrium as a byproduct.

Even in product markets, the stabilization of unit revenue

in a transaction at an early stage of production may introduce

problems at later stages.

If the published price of a raw

material is actually stabilized unit revenue, then the contract
between a producer of a product for which the raw material is an

input and a downstream purchaser cannot be made appropriately
contingent on marginal cost.

Theorem 4.

Under marginal—cost pricing, expected profit is a

strictly decreasing function of the capital stock, at the
efficient capital stock.
Proof:

Let p be the marginal—cost price:

p(Ic.,w,x) = 'C(Q(K,w,x) ,}<,w)

Then expected profit is
(I<:,u,w,r. = EEp

(Kw,x ) 0 (K,w,x ) — C (0,K,w) — rK)

The derivative of expected profit with respect to K is
