A Production-Based Model for the Term Structure
Urban Jermann
NBER Working Paper No. 18774
February 2013
JEL No. E22,G12
ABSTRACT
This paper considers the term structure of interest rates implied by a production-based asset pricing
model where the fundamental drivers are investment in equipment and structures, and inflation. The
model matches the average yield curve up to five year maturity almost perfectly. Longer term yields
are roughly as volatile as in the data. The model also generates time-varying bond risk premiums.
In particular, when running Fama-Bliss regressions of excess returns on forward premiums, the model
produces slope coefficients of roughly half the size of the empirical counterparts. Closed-form expressions
highlight the importance of the capital depreciation rates for interest rate dynamics.

Introduction
There are many models of the term structure of interest rates, only a few tie interest rates

to macroeconomic fundamentals. Among fundamentals-based models, most are driven by consumption. Given the relative success of production-based models in matching features of stock
returns at the aggregate level and in the cross-section, it seems promising to further extend the
production-based approach to the term structure of interest rates.
Consumption-based models of the term structure face a number of diﬃculties. Many of these
are related to the equity premium puzzle (Mehra and Prescott, 1985), according to which empirically reasonable consumption volatility and risk aversion are too small to match the sizable
historical equity premium. Backus, Gregory, and Zin (1989) find that complete markets models
cannot explain the sign, the magnitude nor the variability of the term premium. In this class of
models, expected consumption growth and real yields are positively correlated, Chapman (1997)
reports some supportive evidence for this property, as do Berardi and Torous (2005). Considering
richer model specifications, several more recent studies report more positive results for explaining term premiums; for instance, Wachter (2006), Bansal and Shaliastovich (2010), Piazzesi and
Schneider (2007), Ehling, Gallmeyer, Heyerdahl-Larsen, and Illeditsch (2011), and Rudebusch
and Swansson (2008). General equilibrium models that start from a consumption-based model
and add elements of endogenous production still face diﬃculties with jointly explaining the term
structure and macroeconomic aggregates, as shown in Binsbergen, Fernandez-Villaverde, Koijen,
and Rubio-Ramirez (2010).
Production-based asset pricing models have linked stock returns to fundamentals such as
investment and productivity. Cochrane (1991) establishes the link between a firm’s return to
investment and its market return, he also shows a tight empirical relation between aggregate
investment and stock returns. Production-based models have been used to explain the value
premium (Zhang (2005)), and properties of external financing behavior (Li, Livdan and Zhang
(2009)). Production-based models have also shown to be useful for understanding the cross-section
of stock returns more generally, see for instance Berk, Green, and Naik (1999), Liu, Whited, and
Zhang (2009), Belo (2010), Tuzel (2010), and Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2012).1
The objective of this paper is to extend the production-based approach to price nominal bonds

ammarino (2004), Li, Vassalou, and Xing (2003), Warusawitharana (2010), Kogan (2004), Cooper (2006), Pastor

of diﬀerent maturities. Specifically, this paper builds on Jermann (2010) that has analyzed the
determinants of the equity premium and presented a model that can quantitatively match first
and second moments of the real returns on stocks and short term real bonds. I start from the
same two-sector investment model based on equipment and structures. The paper here extends
the analysis to the term structure of nominal bonds and explicitly introduces inflation. The paper
is also related to Cochrane’s 1988 working paper that presents a two-sector investment model and
shows that the real forward premium from the model can track quite well its empirical counterpart
over 1952-1986. In my paper, I present a more detailed analysis of the term structure, explicitly
introduce inflation, and consider nominal bonds. The real side of the model is also more general,
importantly, I allow for general curvature in the capital adjustment cost functions as opposed to
Cochrane’s quadratic specification
The main quantitative findings are that the model, calibrated to match the equity premium
and the volatility of stock returns as well as the mean and volatility of short term yields, matches
the average yield curve up to five year maturity almost perfectly. Longer term yields are roughly as
volatile as in the data. The model also generates time-varying bond risk premiums. In particular,
when running Fama-Bliss regressions of excess returns on forward premiums, the model produces
slope coeﬃcients of roughly half the size of the empirical counterparts.
My model is a two-sector version of a q-theory investment model. Firms’ optimal investment
choices generate the well known equivalence between market returns and investment returns. The
short term real risk free rate can be seen as a long-short portfolio of the two risky investment
returns. With the help of a continuous-time version of the model, the economic forces that drive
the quantitative results are revealed explicitly. In particular, the short rate is shown to be a
weighted average of the two expected investment returns, where the weights are constant and
simple functions of the adjustment cost curvature parameters. Expected returns and the market
price of risk are driven by the two investment to capital ratios that display important low frequency
components. The volatility of the short rate is also a function of the investment to capital ratios.
Thus, even with homoscedastic shocks, the model endogenously produces time-varying bond risk
premiums. A key new finding is that the diﬀerence in depreciation rates between structures and
equipment plays a crucial role for whether interest rates commove positively or negatively with
investment, and for whether the implied term premium for bonds with a short maturity is positive
or negative.
Section 2 presents the model, and section 3 the quantitative analysis. Section 4 analyzes a
continuous-time version of the model. Section 5 concludes.

Model
This section starts by presenting the real side of the model which was first used in Jermann

(2010). Inflation is then introduced.

2.1

Real model

Assume an environment where uncertainty is modelled as the realization of , one out of a set
of two (s1  s2 ), with  the current period realization and  ≡ (0  1   ) the history up to and

including . Assume a revenue function with two capital stocks  (−1 ) for  = 1 2

(1)

=1

As is standard,  (−1 ) is chosen one period before it becomes productive.  () represents the
resources available after the firm has optimally chosen and paid factors of production that are
selected within the period, for instance labor.2  ( ) is driven by productivity shocks and other
factors aﬀecting the marginal product of capital. It is key that there are as many capital stocks as
there are states of nature next period. Without this property, it would not be possible to recover
state prices from the firm’s production choices.
Capital of type  accumulates through

  =  −1 (1 −   ) +   

where   is the depreciation rate, and  ( ) is investment. The total cost of investing in capital
of type  includes convex adjustment costs and is given by

with    0,   1. For each capital stock, diﬀerent values for , , and  will be allowed. The
most important parameter is the curvature , as it determines the volatility of percentage changes
in the marginal adjustment cost, and thus Tobin’s q, relative to investment volatility. The other
parameters play a minor role for the main asset pricing properties this paper focuses on.
Taking as given state prices  ( ), a representative firm solves the following problem,

with respect to the  element of the function. Eq. (7) determines the marginal q,  ( ), the
marginal investment cost, and given that the production function and adjustment cost functions
are homogenous of degree one, it also equals the average q (Tobin’s q).
It is our objective to recover the state prices that drive firms’ decisions from investment and
capital choices. To do this, define the investment return as

With these state prices, any claim can be priced; multi-period claims are priced by iterating
forward. To eﬃciently compute stock returns, I can use the equivalence between investment
returns and market returns that comes form the homogeneity assumptions. In particular, consider
the market returns to the aggregate capital stock

by the firm and  (  +1 ) the ex-dividend value of the firm. Assuming constant returns to scale
5

in  () and  (), it can easily be shown that this return will be equal to a weighted average of
the investment returns:

To evaluate the asset pricing implications of this model, we can postulate a stochastic process
for the firms’ investment growth rates
¡

   +1 ≡    +1     = 1 2

(13)

and for the marginal product terms  ( ). Assuming initial conditions for the two capital
stocks and investment,  (−1 ) and  (−1 ), the investment growth process can be used to
generate histories for investment and capital stocks. Based on these, one can generate investment
returns,  (  +1 ), state prices  (+1 | ) and the prices and returns of any security of interest.
Overall, this simple model allows one to produce asset prices from firms’ investment behavior and
technology shocks that can then be compared to data on asset prices. As described in detail in
Jermann (2010), to insure stationary returns for the aggregate capital stock, we require investment
growth rates across the two types of capital not only to be perfectly (conditionally) correlated
(as is implicit in the two-state assumption), but also to have the same realizations. That is,
¡
¢
¡
¢
   +1 =    +1 for  = 1 2

(14)

Given our empirical implementation with investment in equipment and in structures, assuming
equal volatility of investment growth rates is consistent with the data.3

2.2

Pricing nominal bonds

To price nominal bonds, I need to explicitly introduce inflation. It is assumed that inflation is
given exogenously. In the model, the real value of firms’ cash flows is not aﬀected by inflation. I
assume that inflation is not a priced factor, in the sense that inflation risk will only require a risk
premium to the extent that inflation is correlated with the real side of the model. This approach
seems essentially comparable to the way nominal bonds are priced in basic consumption-based
asset pricing models.
3

See Jermann (2010) for more details. It is also shown how to introduce time-varying investment specific

technologies to accomodate possible diﬀerences in growth rates across capital stocks. Given the limited eﬀect on
the main asset pricing properties of this extension, the more simple specification is used here.

6

Assume inflation can have two possible realizations,  ( ), with  ∈ (z1  z2 ). For transparency, I present here the most basic case. It is straightforward to extended the approach to
handle an inflation process with more than two states and a richer dependence on history. Combined with the real side presented before, we now have an extended state space that has a total
of four states, the product of (s1  s2 ) and (z1  z2 ). In this extended state space, we have
¡
¢
¡
¢
¡
¢
 +1 |    =  +1  z1 |    +  +1  z2 |    

(15)

that is, for two states that diﬀer only by next period’s inflation realization, the sum of the state
prices equals the price for delivery conditional on a real state realization but independent of
the inflation realization. To determine the state prices in the extended state space, we make
two assumptions. First, we assume that the firms’ technology and investment decisions are not
contingent on inflation, so that
¡
¢
¡
¢
 +1 |    =  +1 | 

(16)

With this assumption, the state prices derived from the real model (without considering inflation)
correspond to the sums of two state prices in the extended setup here. To impose that inflation is
not a priced factor, the second assumption is: If two states of nature only diﬀer by their inflation
realization, then the ratio of their state prices is assumed to equal the ratio of their (physical)
probabilities. Thus, for instance, we have

Quantitative analysis
This section describes the calibration procedure and then presents quantitative results. The

calibration fixes a first set of parameter values to match some direct empirical counterparts; a
second set of parameter values is determined to match the first and second moments of US stock
and short term bond returns. The test of the model consists in examining the implications for
the term premium and the predictability of bond excess returns.

3.1

Calibration

The joint dynamics of investment growth and inflation are summarized by a first-order VAR.
Table 1 shows four versions of the VAR estimated for investment in equipment and in structures,
and for inflation measured by the CPI and the GDP deflator, for the period 1952-2010. There
is moderately positive correlation between the innovations of investment growth and inflation.
Inflation forecasts investment typically with a negative coeﬃcient, while investment forecasts
inflation with a positive coeﬃcient. The calibration of the model targets the values of these
moments averaged across the four empirical counterparts. As shown in Table 1, consistent with
our modelling assumption, the historical volatility of equipment and structures are very similar.
In the model, the joint process for investment growth and inflation is represented by a fourstate Markov chain. The model implied VAR reported in Table 1 is based on a very long simulated
8

sample. The model implied VAR cannot perfectly match the calibration target, mainly because
with the limited number of grid points, the Markov chain cannot perfectly match the high persistence for inflation. The model implied VAR also does not fit perfectly, because of the bounds
imposed when the  ratios of the two types of capital move far away from their steady state
values. This is needed to insure a finite firm value. In particular, a lower and an upper limit
for  at 00983 and 01745 are set, respectively. When the simulated process with the original investment growth rate realizations would go outside a bound, the realized growth rates are
limited to reach exactly the lower or the upper bound, respectively. Asset pricing implications
are not significantly aﬀected by the exact values of these bounds. More details, and the values
for the parameters of the Markov chain, are given in Appendix D. The appendix also shows
that none of the conclusions of our analysis depends on the exact specification of this process,
because the model implied term structure behavior is not very sensitive to small changes in the
investment/inflation process.

( ) and  refer to moments of the innovations,  is investment growth,
 is inflation; growth rates are first diﬀerenced logarithms.
Drift terms are included in the realizations of the Markov chain. They correspond to the
historical averages of investment growth rates and inflation of 00355 and 00363, respectively.
Several parameters describing firm technology are set to match long term averages of plausible
empirical counterparts. These are the depreciation rates,   and   , the average relative value
of the capital stocks,   , and the adjustment cost parameters        . Except for
the role of the depreciation rates for interest rate dynamics, these parameters impact our main
9

quantitative results only moderately. The sources for the values are described in Jermann (2010).

There are 4 remaining parameters: the two adjustment cost curvature parameters,   and
  , and the marginal product coeﬃcients  and  . These parameters are important for asset
pricing implications, and they do not have obvious direct empirical counterparts. Following
Jermann (2010), these four parameters are set to match four moments from the data, under
the assumption that      . The target moments are the unconditional mean and standard
deviations of the aggregate US stock market and the one-year yields for the period 1952-2010.
Practically, for a fixed sample of 100,000 periods, I search over the four-dimensional parameter
space.
With the assumption that      , expected returns in the calibrated model are larger for
structures than for equipment, which is consistent with the empirical analysis in Tuzel (2010).
More direct evidence presented in Jermann (2010) also suggests that the adjustment cost curvature
should be larger for structures than for equipment. For instance, the fact that the first-order
serial correlation of the growth rates is somewhat higher for structures than for equipment can
be interpreted as an expression of the desire to smooth investment over time due to the relatively
higher adjustment cost. Some of the parameter estimates in Israelsen (2010), which contains a
structural estimation of a two-sector adjustment cost model with structures and equipment, are
not consistent with this assumption. There are several diﬀerences in the models and the data
that can potentially account for the diﬀerent estimates.
As shown in Table 3, the model can perfectly match the four targeted moments. Each of the
four parameters aﬀect all four moments, but with diﬀerent degrees of sensitivities. In particular,
for the short term yield, the levels of the marginal product coeﬃcients  and  are important.
To see this, consider the deterministic model version with constant investment growth rates,

which is increasing in the marginal product term .4 The implied magnitudes of the adjustment

costs are low, amounting to 5% and 6% of investment on average, for equipment and structures,
respectively. Marginal costs are 14 and 12 on average.

To insure that state prices are always nonnegative, we make the marginal product term for
structures stochastic, such that  (1 ±  ( )). The size of the shock  () is determined so that
the state prices that would go negative without the shock, are equal to 0. In the benchmark
simulation,  is nonzero less than 7% of the time. This is further discussed below.

Results

I consider the model’s implication for nominal bonds of diﬀerent maturities and compare these
to the Fama and Bliss data series of US Treasury bonds’ implied discount bonds. Table 4 shows
the means and standard deviations for yields of diﬀerent maturities. The model matches the
slope of the empirical term structure very well. The term premium (yield diﬀerential) for a fiveyear bond over a one-year bond is about half a percent as in the data. At least as far back as
Shiller (1979), it has been recognized that models that satisfy the expectations hypothesis have

Returns in the model could be compared to an unlevered return to capital. For simplicity and comparability

with the literature, this is not done here.

diﬃculties matching the volatility of yields with longer maturities. The model here does a good
job with yield volatilities; the standard deviations for longer term yields are only moderately
lower than their empirical counterparts.

What determines the term premium in this model? As can be seen in Table 4, the model
produces a positive real term premium and a smaller negative risk premium for inflation risk.
In particular, the five-year term premium equals 588 − 529 = 059, while the term premium
for real yields equals 260 − 175 = 085. This implies a negative premium for inflation risk of
85 − 59 = −26 basis points.
Bond excess returns are in general negatively correlated with the stochastic discount factor,
so that high returns are realized in lowly valued states (relative to their probabilities). High
investment implies lower real interest rates (and thus higher real bond returns) at the same time
as lower state prices (and stochastic discount factors). Section 4 will illustrate the mechanisms
that drive these results with a continuous-time version of the model.
The negative inflation risk premium is due to the implied negative correlation between inflation
and the stochastic discount factor. This property is brought about by the positive correlation
between innovations in investment and inflation, as well as the positive coeﬃcient on investment in
12

the VAR’s equation for inflation. When investment is high, inflation and expected inflation have
a tendency to be high too. Therefore, inflation makes a negative contribution to the returns of
nominal bonds at times when investment, and thus stock returns, are high. The fact that inflation
enters the VAR’s equation for investment with a negative coeﬃcient has a minor quantitative
eﬀect.5
Having shown that the model’s term premium matches its empirical counterpart reasonably
well in some dimensions, we now consider return predictability. In particular, we consider the
popular Fama-Bliss excess return regressions that seek to forecast excess return for -period
bonds with the forward premium of -period bonds. These regressions provide a direct test of
the expectations hypothesis, according to which excess returns should not be forecastable. As
shown in Table 5, empirically, as is well known, excess returns are in fact forecastable with the
forward premium. For every one point increase in the forward premium, excess returns increase
by roughly the same amount. Typically, most fundamentals-based asset pricing models have a
hard time producing the extent of return predictability observed in the data. As shown in Table
5, the model doesn’t perfectly match the data, but it can produce coeﬃcients that are roughly
half the size of the empirical counterparts.

The direct historical evidence on the real term structure from inflation-indexed bonds is short and inconclusive.

As documented in Piazzesi and Schneider (2007), the term structure of inflation-indexed bonds has been on average
upward sloping for the US and downward sloping for the UK.

13

The model’s ability to produce strong return forecastability stems from the implied timevariation in the market price of risk and in risk premiums. In the model, expected returns and
the market price of risk are a function of the state variables, in particular, the investment to
capital ratios of the two types of capital.
As for average yields, inflation risk plays a relatively minor role for the Fama-Bliss regressions.
To illustrate the eﬀect of inflation, we run two alternative versions of the Fama-Bliss regression.
First, inflation risk is eliminated from the model by setting the standard deviation of inflation to
zero. Second, the nominal forward premium is replaced as a regressor by the forward premium
for real bonds. In both cases, as seen in Table 6, the slope coeﬃcients increase moderately.

To conclude this section, I consider here the importance of realizations at the borders of the
state space. In particular, in order to guarantee positive state prices throughout, shocks to the
marginal product of structures are introduced such that the marginal product term becomes
 (1 ±  ( )), with the value for  ( ) set so that a particular state price is equal to zero, if it
were to drop below zero without the shock. For the benchmark calibration, this shock kicks in
somewhat less than 7% of the time, when  for structures becomes very small. It turns out
that the model implied regression coeﬃcients are partially driven by realizations with low 
14

ratios for structures.
Fig. 1 shows expected excess returns and the forward premium as a function of the 
ratio for structures. Both display the negative (conditional) relation which contributes to the
positive regression coeﬃcient in the Fama-Bliss regression. The figure also shows plots for the
market price of risk and the conditional equity premium. In line with the expected excess returns
for the two-period bond, both are downward sloping. However, the two top panels display some
nonlinearity for lower values of the  ratio, which suggests that regression coeﬃcients are
partially determined by this region. For instance, we can run the Fama-Bliss regression with
only those observations for which none of the next periods’ state prices is zero, which roughly
eliminates the 7% of observations with the lowest realization for the  ratio. In this case, for
the two-period bond, the slope coeﬃcient drops to 19 (from 30 reported in Table 5) and for
the five-year bond it drops to 33 (from 55 in Table 5). One could consider alternative ways to
insure positive state prices. However, given the lack of theoretical guidance and the fact that
empirically this essentially concerns relatively rare outcomes, some arbitrariness is unavoidable.
Overall, while the regression coeﬃcients appear somewhat sensitive to auxiliary assumptions,
endogenously time-varying risk premiums are a robust feature of this model. See Appendix A for
additional evidence about the robustness of our results with respect to these assumptions.

3.3

Additional results

Given the extensive empirical literature on term structure behavior, this subsection examines
additional model implications and compares these to their empirical counterparts. In particular,
the autocorrelation of yields and the forecasting ability of term spreads for inflation and excess
stock returns are considered. Of course, one would not expect this parsimoniously parameterized
small scale model to perfectly match all moments in the data. Nevertheless, the model does a
very good job with the autocorrelations, and it can reproduce at least qualitatively the considered
evidence on the forecasting ability of term spreads.
As is well known, yields are highly autocorrelated. Table 7, panel A, displays autocorrelations
for the various maturities over a one-year period. These are between 85 and 9, with higher
autocorrelations for the longer maturities. The yields in the model almost match these values.
There is a long tradition in examining the information content of the term structure for future
economic variables. For instance, Miskhin (1990), or Fama (1990), study the information in the
term structure for future inflation. Following Mishkin, I regress the change in the n-year inflation

15

rate from the one-year inflation rate, ln + − ln +1 , on the term spread between the n-year
and the one-year yield,

(23)

As shown in Table 7, panel B, the empirical slope coeﬃcients   are between 28 and 37, with
R2s between 11 and 14, depending on the maturities. In the model, the slope coeﬃcients are
somewhat lower, between 10 and 14, and the term spread’s forecasting ability is also lower, with
R2s between 01 and 03. The model can generate declining slope coeﬃcients and declining R2s
as a function of maturity, as observed in the data.
Empirical studies have also examined the term spread’s ability to predict stock returns. Examples are Fama and French (1989), and more recently, Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005). I consider
here a simple univariate regression that can capture some of the term spread’s forecasting ability
for stocks:

(24)

Stock market returns (value-weighted returns from CRSP) in excess of the one-year yield for
diﬀerent horizons, + , are regressed on the five-year term spread. As shown in Table 7,
panel C, empirical slope coeﬃcients are between 4 and 11 with R2s between 04 and 10. That
is, a high term spread forecasts high excess returns for stocks (as seen earlier, a high term spread
also forecasts high excess returns for bonds). The model can produce positive slope coeﬃcients,
however, these are somewhat smaller that in the data; the R2s are also smaller in the model.
Overall, the model reproduces qualitatively how in the data the term spread is linked to future
inflation and future stock returns, but, the relations in the model are somewhat weaker than in
the data.

Continuous-time analysis
The continuous-time version of the model without inflation provides additional insights into

the behavior of the short rate, the market price of risk, and the term premium. In particular,
we will see that the capital depreciation rates play a key role for interest dynamics, while not
impacting much other asset pricing implications.

where  is a univariate Brownian motion, and  () and  () are functions of state variables

Clearly, In order to be able to recover the discount factor process from the two returns, the
two diﬀusion terms need to be diﬀerent, that is, 2 − 1 6= 0. As in the discrete time analysis,
once we specify processes for investment in the two types of capital, we have a fully specified
discount factor process.

(33)

the latter representing the return of a given capital stock at steady state in a deterministic
environment with a constant growth rate  . The deterministic return ̄ is a useful quantity to
summarize the eﬀects of the technology parameters on the implied discount rate process. If we
were to consider a deterministic environment, ̄ would have to be the same for the two capital
stocks. But, as seen in Eq. (32), in this stochastic setup, the diﬀerence between ̄ across types of
capital is an important contributor to the market price of risk. Starting from  2   1 and   0,
our calibration selects ̄2 − ̄1  0 and  1 +  2 − 3  0 to produce a large enough (positive)
equity premium and to generate enough volatility for the market return. That is, |  0, and
in this case the discount factor is lower when investment and the market return are high.
Away from steady-state, the market price of risk will change as a function of the state variables.
Movements in the model’s endogenous state variables, the investment to capital ratios  in
the two sectors, are the main drivers. In particular, as is clear from Eq. (31), with  −   0,
an increase in  reduces the expected return for this type of capital. Intuitively, with high
 the value of capital, , is high, and thus expected returns are low. If  gets very small
(close to 0) the expected return can become very large. For our quantitative experiments, this
eﬀect is particularly strong when 2 2 is low, so that 2 increases, driving up the market price of
risk. As shown in Jermann (2010), the time-variation in , and hence the variation in the equity
premium, is substantial enough to have implied at some occasions a negative conditional equity
premium for the model calibrated to the US economy.

2 − 1
2 − 1 2

In particular, consider a path where  = 0 for a very long time, such that  and   have converged, and

  has converged to  − 1 + .

19

the short rate can be seen as a weighted average of the two expected returns 1 and 2 . With
positively correlated returns, and assuming (without loss of generality)  2   1  0, the weight
on the less volatile return,

2
,
 2 −1

is then larger than one, and the other weight is negative. The

economic intuition is the following. There are two risky investment returns that are perfectly
(conditionally) correlated, so that the risk free rate is created with a portfolio of the two risky
returns for which the two return realizations exactly oﬀset each other. This portfolio puts a
positive weight on the less volatile return and a negative weight (that is smaller in absolute
value) on the more volatile return.
Specializing to the case  =  as in the benchmark calibration, the equation for the short
rate becomes
=

2 − 1
1 − 1
1 −

2 − 1
2 − 1 2

(34)

which implies that the "weights" attached to the expected returns are simple functions of the constant adjustment cost curvature parameters   . Thus, the short rate is driven only by movements
in expected returns.
In our simulations, expected returns are positively correlated, but not perfectly so. The
expectation of the less volatile return, 1 , has a relatively bigger weight, but it is also less volatile
than 2 . In our benchmark calibration, the impact of 1 dominates. To see why this is the
case, and to illustrate this mechanism further, assume that drift and diﬀusion of investment, 
and   are constant, so that the only state variables are 1 1 and 2 2 , and consider the
diﬀerential equation for the short rate

Some properties of the interest rate are now obvious. If any of the curvature parameters  is close
to 1, then the short rate can be arbitrarily smooth. In addition, interest volatility moves with the
state variables, that is, interest rates are heteroscedastic even with homoscedastic investment.
At the steady state,

  ̄2 +  2 − ̄1 −  1 

(38)

As shown in Eq. (38), in addition to the terms that are also included in the market price of
risk,   , ̄ and   , the depreciation rates appear explicitly. The equation implies that for the
case with ̄1 = ̄2 , if the sector with the higher curvature, , has the higher depreciation rate,
, then the short rate commoves positively with investment shocks ( |  0), and if the sector
with the higher curvature has a lower depreciation rate, the short rate commoves negatively with
investment ( |  0). Essentially, with a higher depreciation rate, the investment to capital
ratio is higher, and thus a given percentage change in investment produces a larger change in the
investment to capital ratio and, everything else equal, in the expected return. Our benchmark
calibration implies that structures are harder to adjust than equipment,  2 − 1  0, also structures
depreciate less than equipment,  2 −  1  0.7 With this particular parameter configuration, at

steady state, innovations in the short rate are negatively related to innovations in investment
(  |  0). Appendix C considers the more general case when 1 6= 2 , as well as the case for
quadratic adjustment costs; the diﬀerence in capital depreciation rates remain a key determinants
of interest rate dynamics.
This mechanism also plays a crucial role for the term premium. While the setup does not
allow for closed form solutions for the term premium, the solution for the short rate oﬀers some
insights. To illustrate this, consider the holding period return of a discount bond with a maturity

The benchmark calibration also implies ̄2 − ̄1  0 , but this diﬀerence is substantially smaller than  1 −  2 .

That is, stochastic changes in the yield drive the stochastic return movements. As is clear from
Eq. (28), the instantaneous risk premium for this bond equals
−   

(42)

Returns in my model are driven by a single Brownian motion, so that, conditionally, all returns
are perfectly correlated (positively or negatively). However, from the perspective of asset prices,
the model has two endogenous state variables, the investment to capital ratios in the two sectors.
For the reported simulations, the yields of diﬀerent maturities move positively together and their
volatilities are not too diﬀerent. Thus, the expression for   can be a useful approximation for
  for shorter maturities, and −   can be a useful approximation for the term premium.
To get a sense of how informative such an approximation is, compare −   to the conditional
log excess return of a discount bond that has a one period maturity when it is sold, that is, the

Conclusion
This paper extends the q theory of investment to price the term structure of nominal bonds.

The quantitative model does a reasonable job matching averages and volatilities of the nominal
term structure for the US. The model also displays time-varying risk premiums for bonds, providing a possible explanation for observed departures from the expectations hypothesis. In the
model, real and nominal risks aﬀect returns on nominal bonds. Quantitatively, real interest risk
plays a more important role for risk premiums than inflation risk. In the paper, the modeling
of the production technology and the role of inflation for firms’ profits is kept simple for transparency and tractability. Further enriching the model with features used in corporate finance or
in macroeconomics would appear to oﬀer fruitful avenues for future research.

For comparability, the discrete-time model here has IID investment growth and no inflation.

Appendix A: On negative state prices
This appendix presents a result that shows that our approach for preventing state prices from
becoming negative is quite general, and thus, that our quantitative results appear quite robust.
In particular, it is shown that when setting one of the two real state prices to zero, for instance,
by assuming a particular value for one of the two productivity realizations, the value of the
productivity realization in the other state is irrelevant for state prices, and thus for bond prices.
To prevent  (s2 | ) from turning negative in some states  , we adjust the marginal produc-

tivity term 2 (1 +  (s1 | ))  by having  (s1 | ) be negative, so that  (s2 | ) = 0. The next

proposition shows that in this case, the value given to  (s2 | ) does not matter at all for the other

real state price  (s1 | ), and thus for bond prices.
Proposition: If

then

¡
¢  (  s1 ) − 2 (  s1 )

 s2 | = 1

(43)

(44)

and thus, the values of the two remaining investment returns 2 (  s2 ) and 1 (  s2 ) do not
matter for state prices and thus bond prices.
Proof:  (s2 | ) = 0 implies 1 (  s1 ) = 2 (  s1 ). Thus

so that

¡

 s1 | = 2
||
1 (  s1 )
2 (  s1 )

(45)

(46)

This proposition implies that when  (s2 | ) is increased to 0, by lowering 2 (  s1 ) through

adjusting  (s1 | ), the value  (s2 | ) takes, and thus 2 (  s2 ) and 1 (  s2 ), do not aﬀect

 (s1 | ). An obvious alternative way to set  (s2 | ) = 0, would be to raise 1 (  s1 ). However,

this would imply—counterfactually—that a negative productivity shock is associated with a positive
innovation in investment growth. In simulations, we also found that in this case, the productivity
shocks would need to be larger and that risk premiums vary even more.

Because of constant returns to scale in  , following Hayashi, it is easy to see that  (1  2   )
= 1 (1   ) + 2 (2   ) = 1 1 ( ) + 2 2 ( ). Thus, it is clear that optimal investment
follows an Ito process,   =  (   )  +   (   )  .

Clearly, in this case, for the normalization 2 − 1  0, a positive equity premium requires
̄2 − ̄1  0. Thus, with equal depreciation rates,  1 =  2 , the short rate commoves positively
with investment, and given the analysis in the main text, short term bonds then have a negative
term premium. A positive term premium requires ̄2 − ̄1   1 −  2 .

Appendix D : Sensitivity to investment/inflation process
This appendix presents additional details about the calibration of the investment/inflation
process, and shows that model implications for the term structure are not very sensitive to
changes in the investment/inflation process.
The benchmark calibration uses a constrained minimization routine to match the population
moments of the target VAR with a four-state Markov chain. This cannot be perfectly achieved. In
particular, the two slope coeﬃcients of the inflation equation cannot be matched simultaneously.
The calibration that is retained produces a reasonably close fit for both of these two coeﬃcients,
while matching the remaining moments of the target VAR. In the simulations, this Markov chain is
modified because upper and lower bounds on investment/capital ratios are imposed, as described
in the main text. This aﬀects somewhat the investment growth process.
Table 9 reports alternative specifications. Specification (A) uses Tauchen’s (1986) method to
fit the VAR with a four-state Markov chain. As is well known, this procedure has diﬃculties
matching processes with high persistence with a small number of grid points. As shown in Table
9, while there are some diﬀerences in the investment/inflation process relative to the Benchmark
case, this has only moderate eﬀects on the model implied term structure. In particular mean
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
and standard deviations of the long term yields,   (5) and   (5) ,and the slope coeﬃcients

from the Fama-Bliss regressions,  (2) and  (5) are only moderately aﬀected. The mean and
¡ ¢
¡ ¢
standard deviation of the short rate,   (1) and   (1) in Table 9 are exactly the same as in
the benchmark case, because the two adjustment cost curvature parameters,   and   , and the

marginal product coeﬃcients  and  are recalibrated to match first and second moments of
the short rate and the market return.
Specification (B) entirely removes the dependence between investment and inflation. This

31

specification also only produces moderately diﬀerent outcomes for interest rate behavior.
