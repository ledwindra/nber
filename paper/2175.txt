Tariffs, Terms of Trade, and the Real Exchange Rate in an Intertemporal
Optimizing Model of the Current Account

ABSTRACT
In this paper a minimal general equilibrium intertemporal model,

with optimizing consumers and producers, is developed to analyze
the process of real exchange rate determination. The model is
completely real, and considers a small open economy that produces
and consumes three goods each period. The model is also used to
analyze the way in which the current account responds to several
shocks. The working of the model is illustrated for the case of two
disturbances: the imposition of import tariffs, and external terms

of trade shocks. In the case of import tariffs, a distinction is
made between temporary, anticipated, and permanent changes. It is
shown that, without imposing rigidities or adjustment costs,

interesting paths for the equilibrium real exchange rate can be
generated. In particular "overshooting" and movements in opposite
directions in periods one and two can be observed. Precise
conditions under which temporary import tariffs will improve the
current account are derived. Finally, several ways in which the
model can be extended to take into account other issues such as
changes in the fiscal deficit, and financial deregulation are
discussed in detail.

Introduction
The recent wide fluctuations experienced by real exchange rates (RERs)

in the U.S. and other countries have generated concern among policymakers

and academics. In fact, in the last two years or so policy analyses have
increasingly focused on issues related to real exchange rate disequilibrium,
and some proposals aimed at actively intervening in the exchange market in
order to reduce real exchange rate "misalignment" have been discussed.1
These proposals, however, would only make sense if recent RER movements in
fact represent a disequilibrium phenomenon, where the actual RER exhibits

sustained departures from its equilibrium value. If, on the other hand,
this is not the case, and observed RER changes respond to "fundamentals,"

intervention could have counterproductive effects. It would seem, then,
that in order to fully understand RER behavior, and to propose policy
actions, it is first necessary to have a fully articulated theory on how the
equilibrium value of this relative price responds to different (real)

disturbances. Most of the recent exchange rates research, however, has
focused on nominal exchange rate determination, tending to ignore real

aspects of real exchange rate behavior.2 The purpose of this paper is to
propose a minimal real model suitable for analyzing how equilibrium RERs

respond to different (real) shocks. The functioning of the model is
illustrated for the case of two disturbances: changes in import tariffs and
terms of trade shocks. However, the way in which the minimal model can be
expanded to analyze other disturbances is illustrated in detail at the end
of the paper.3

The model presented in this paper considers the case of a small open
economy where optimizing producers and consumers produce and consume three
goods --

importables, exportables and nontradables. Foreign borrowing is

allowed, and the only constraint faced by the nationals of this country is
that the present, value of the current account balances equals zero. There

is no uncertainty, and agents have perfect foresight. The model is
completely real and is solved using duality theory.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II a very general
intertemporal general equilibrium model of a (small) real economy with

optimizing consumers and producers is developed. Here the concept of equilibrium RER in an interteniporal setting is discussed, and the modeling

strategy is set forward. Section III deals with changes in import tariffs
(temporary, permanent and anticipated) and their effect on equilibrium RERs.

Here, the effect of temporary tariffs on the current account is also

analyzed. It is shown that whether this type of policy will result in a
worsening or in an improvement of the current account will depend on the

different intertemporal elasticities. In Section IV the impact of changes
in the international terms of trade on the path of equilibrium RERs is

analyzed. The results obtained are then compared to those of the tariff
case. In Section V the effect of terms of trade changes on the current
account are investigated. The analysis presented here is essentially an
extension of the Laursen-Metzler model to the intertemporal case with

nontradables. Section VI deals with extensions. It is shown that the model
is general enough as to handle a large number of issues, including the

welfare effects of alternative policy packages dealing with economic

deregulation. Section VII contains the concluding remarks.

II. The I1odel

Although the framework used is general enough as to accommodate many
goods and factors, it is useful to think of this economy as producing three

3

goods - -

exportables

(X), importables

(st)

and nontradables (N)

-

-

using standard technology, under perfect competition. It is assumed chat
there are more factors than tradable goods, so that factor price equaliza-

tion does not hold. One way to think of this is by assuming that capital is
sector specific, while labor can move freely across all three sectors.

Alternatively, one can think that this economy uses capital, labor and two
different types of land.

In this version of the model there is no investment, capital

accumulation or growth (see, however, Section V). We consider two periods
only --

periods

1 and 2. Residents of this country can borrow or lend

internationally at the given world rate of interest. There are no exchange
controls, and the only constraint is that at the end of period 2 the country

has paid its debts.4 The importation of M is subject to specific import
tariffs both in periods 1 and 2.

Since there is no investment, the current

account is exactly equal to savings in each period. If the residents of
this country dis-save in period 1, their expenditure will exceed their

income, and the corresponding current account deficit will be financed

through borrowing from abroad. On the preferences side, it is assumed that
the utility function is time weakly separable, with preferences in each

period being homothetical. This means that consumer's optimization takes
place in two stages. Given prices and the discount factor, consumers first
decide how to allocate expenditure across periods. In the second stage,
they decide how to allocate each period's expenditure across the three

goods. These assumptions regarding preferences turn out to be very convenient, since they permit the use of within-period price indexes, as in

Svensson and Razin (1983) and Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1986). The

nominal exchange rate is fixed and equal to one. The price of X is taken

4

as the numeraire.
The model is worked out using duality theory and is given by equations
(1) through (5)

11.1 The Concept of EQuilibrium Real Exchange Rates
In models with importables and exportables the definition of "the" real
exchange rate becomes "tricky", since the by-now traditional concept of

6

relative price of tradables to nontradables loses some meaning. The reason,
of course, is that if there are shocks that affect the price of X relative

to M,

it is not possible to talk about the Hicksian composite 'tradables"

anymore. In a way, in this type of model there are two RERs: the relative
price of exportables to nontradables, and the relative price of importables

to nontradables (1/q). For this reason, and in order to simplify the
exposition, in this paper we will focus on the (inverse) of real exchange

rate for exports q. Of course, once it is known how q responds to
changes in fundamentals, it is possible to compute the effect of shocks on
any of the traditional indexes of RER change.

In the intertemporal model presented above there is not 2 equilibrium
value of the real exchange rate, but rather a path of equilibrium RERs.
Within this intertemporal framework the equilibrium RER in a particular

period is defined as the inverse of q that, for given values of other
variables such as world prices, technology and tariffs, equilibrates
simultaneously the external and internal (i.e., nontradables) sectors.6 In
terms of the model the vector of equilibrium relative prices

(l2)

is composed of those qt's that satisfy equations (1) through (5), for
given values of the other fundamental variables. In that regard, since the
system given by equations (l)-(5) depicts a full equilibrium -intertemporal for the external sector --

and

both

period-by-period for the non-

tradables market, the initial q's are the (inverse of the) equilibrium
real exchange rates for periods 1 and 2.
From the inspection of equations (l)-(5) it is apparent that exogenous
shocks in, say, the international terms of trade, will affect the vector of

equilibrium RERs through two interrelated channels. The first one, which has
been subject to some discussion in the literature, is related to intratempo-

-7

ral

effects of terms of trade shocks on resource allocation and consumption

decisions. For example, as a result of a temporary worsening of the terms of

trade, there will be a tendency to produce more and consume less of M in
that period. This, plus the income effect resulting from the worsening of
the terms of trade will generate an incipient disequilibrium in the nontrad.
ables market which will have to be resolved by a change in the equilibrium
In fact, if we assume that there is an absence of foreign borrowing these

q.

intratemporal effects will be the only relevant ones. However, with capital
mobility, as in the current model, there is a second intertemporal channel
through which changes in exogenous variables will affect the vector of

equilibrium RERs. For example, in the case of a temporary worsening of the
terms of trade, the consumption discount factor

will be affected,

altering the intertemporal allocation of consumption. In the rest of the
paper we will emphasize the role of this intertemporal effect.

11.2. The Solution of the Model
Equations (l)-(5) can be manipulated to find out how the vector of
equilibrium RERs responds to exogenous shocks such as changes in tariffs,
disturbances to the international terms of trade, international transfers,

and changes in world interest rates. From (l)-(5) and (7) the reaction of
the current account to these types of shocks can also be found.

Intertemporal substitution

E11,E12, and E22. For example, E12, is the

response of (real) consumption on all goods in period 1 to changes in period

2's (exact) price index. Notice, however, that given the two periods nature
of this model, and the assumption of time separability of the utility
function there is gross substitutability of (all) goods across both periods,

so that E12 is unambigously positive.
Since the price indexes

it

and

are unit expenditure functions,

it

their derivatives with respect to the different prices are positive and are

interpreted as consumption shares. Intratemporal cross demand effects,
however, can be either positive or negative. The source of this indeterminacy stems both from the possibility of within period gross substitutability
or complementarity for any pair of goods, and from intertemporal

substitution in consumption. Take for example, the case of the cross price

III. Tariffs, Equilibrium Real Exchange Rates and the Current Account
The traditional international and development literatures have analyzed
the effects of tariff changes on the equilibrium real exchange rate from two

perspectives. First, in the shadow pricing literature it has been argued
that the shadow price of foreign exchange can be approximated by the (real)

exchange rate under free trade. Along these lines authors have investigated

how the RER will be affected if J.

trade

restrictions are lifted (Taylor

1978). Second, the policy literature on international trade liberalization
and reform has discussed the way in which the lowering of tariffs and relaxation of other trade impediments will affect the equilibrium real exchange

rate (Balassa 1982). The standard result from most of the work along both
of these traditions is that the imposition of an import tariff will tend to
improve the current account and will require an appreciation of the equilib-

rium real exchange rate. However, a shortcoming of this literature is that
it has generally used partial equilibrium models without nontradables, and

has ignored intertemporal considerations. As a result, these models have
not been able to tackle important questions such as the effects of temporary
or unanticipated shocks on the real exchange rate and current account.

111.1. Temorarv Changes in Tariffs
In this section we investigate the effects of a temporary change in
period l's tariff on the vector of equilibrium real exchange rates and on

the capital account in period 1. In order to simplify the notation assume
that initially tariffs in period 1 and 2 are equal to

—

r.

We first discuss the case where initial tariffs are equal to zero, and

then more to the more general case of positive initial tariffs. From (8),

setting dr1 — dp1,

dr2 — dp2

0 and evaluating for initial rs

0, we

obtain the following expressions for changes in the equilibrium relative
prices in periods 1 and 2:

that (9) involves substitution effects only. The reason is that

by assuming zero initial tariffs we do not have first order income effects.

The sign of (9) is undetermined, since E

0.

If, however, it is

assumed that importables and nontradables are gross substitutes in period 1
(E

we obtain:

Only in this case, then, we

pq

q
have that the more traditional result that suggests that higher tariffs

an equilibrium real depreciation, will hold. The intuition for this
is rather simple. With no income effects and gross substitutability

demand everywhere, the increase in period 1 import prices generated by

the imposition of the tariff, will result in a reduction in the demand for
M in that period, and an increase in demand for all other goods including
nontradables in that period. As a consequence both production and the

12

relative price of N in period I will increase.
Assuming no first order income effect, the change in period 2
equilibrium price of nontradables will be affected by the temporary period 1
tariff in the following way:

-

{Eq2ql[Eplql RlqlI +

E2llRlql

(10)

Eqlql]}

Notice that in this intertemporal model a temporary tariff imposition
in period 1 only will affect the equilibrium RER in future periods.

This,

of course, is only possible in a model with borrowing, where agents can use
the international capital market to smooth the effects of foreign shocks

through time. If E 2 1.

in (10), then there is no intertemporal

substitution and (dq2/dr1)

0. If however,

>

0, and under the

E2q1
assumption of gross substitutability everywhere

(dq2/dr1) is positive,

indicating that a temporary tariff in period 1 will result in an equilibrium

appreciation in period 2. The intuition in this case is analogous to the
case discussed above.

Let us consider now the case when tariffs are initially greater than
zero. Now, we will have first order income effect and a temporary tariff

in (8), which under usual

Equations (11) and (12) provide a number of important results. First,
they show that in this general case, contrary to the more traditional shadow
pricing and trade reform literature temporal changes in tariffs don't

necessarily result in an equilibrium real depreciation. In fact the signs
1

of dq /dr

2

and dq /dr

are undetermined. Second, in the current model

there are income effects which can, and generally will, operate in the

opposite direction than the substitution effect. The importance of the
income effects will depend on the initial levels of the tariffs

andon Ew, ,rW
E2 and E1

irW

and

Another important aspect of (11) and (12) is that the equilibrium path
of the real exchange rate (RER) can be characterized by "overshooting,"

where q1 increases by more than q2. Moreover, it is possible that as a
result of the temporary tariff increase q1 and q2 will move in opposite
directions. This, of course, makes the evaluation of actual movements of
RER's, and the determination of whether they represent equilibrium or

disequilibrium movement, particularly difficult. Notice that this type of
behavior of the RERs is not the result of price rigidities, but rather
responds to different values of the elasticities in different periods.
In sum, then, in this general equilibrium intertemporal setting with
foreign borrowing it is not possible to determine a priori whether temporary
tariff hikes will appreciate or depreciate the equilibrium real exchange

rate. Moreover, in this model it is possible to obtain several "puzzling"
time path of the RERs, including overshooting, or even movements in opposite

directions. This result is in contradiction to the more traditional, and
generally accepted, policy oriented literature on tariff reforms and shadow
pricing.

111.2 Temporary Tariffs and the Current Account
An important question relates to the way in which the current account

will react to the imposition of a temporary tariff. From equation (7) we
can derive the following expression for the case of very low (or zero)
initial tariffs:

Equation (13) provides a general expression for the response of the
current account in period 1 to the imposition of a temporary tariff that

13

affects period 1 only. Notice that the presence of an E.. in every one
of the RHS terms of equation (13) clearly highlights the fact that tariff
changes will only affect the current account via interteniporal channels.9

The first term in the RHS of equation (13) is positive and captures the
direct effect of the imposition of a tariff in period 1 on the current

account in that period. The intuition is straightforward. The higher
period one tariff makes period 1 consumption relatively more expensive, and
as a result of this the public substitutes consumptions away from period 1
into period 2, generating an improvement of the current account balance in

period 1. The magnitude of this effect will depend both on the intertempo-

ral direct effect E
expenditure

1

1 1

and on the initial share of imports on period 1

irir

ir

p
The second and third terms on the RHS of equation (13) are indirect

effects, that via operate changes in periods 1 and 2 RERs. Since, as was

established above, the signs of (dq1/dr1) and (dq2/dr1)

cannot be

determined a priori, the sign of these two terms in (14) are generally

undetermined. However, their interpretation is quite straightforward within
the intertemporal framework of the current model. If the temporary tariff
results in an equilibrium appreciation in period 1, (dq1/dr1) > 0,

there

will be an additional force towards a current account improvement. The

reasoning is again simple. If the tariff results in a higher equilibrium
price of nontradables in period 1, there will be substitution away from
period 1 expenditure, generating a further improvement in the current
account in that period. The third term on the R}iS relates the change in

period's 2 RER to periods 1 current account. If as a consequence of the
tariff q2 increases (see equation (10) above for the conditions under which
this will take place), there will be a tendency to substitute expenditure

16

away from period 2 into period 1, generating forces that will tend to worsen
period l's current account. In sum, then, the effects of imposing a (temporary) import tariff on period l's current account is undetermined, and will
depend on the strength of the intertemporal price effects, initial
expenditure on importables and nontradables, and on the effects of the

tariff on the RER vector. This results contrasts sharply with the
traditional static view where the conditions for tariffs improving the
current account are related to imports and exports demand elasticities

within each period.10

where (dW/dr1) is the welfare effect of the temporary hike in the tariff,
and is negative. Not too surprisingly, given our previous discussions,
equation (14) is fairly intractable, and cannot be signed a priori.

111.3 Anticipated Future Tariff Changes
We now consider the case of an anticipated change in future import

tariffs. In order to focus the discussion we assume -- as we will do for
the rest of the paper, unless otherwise indicated --

that

initial tariff

17

levels are close to zero, arid that there is gross substitutability in

consumption everywhere. From (8) we can find the effects of anticipated
tariffs on periods 1 and 2 equilibrium relative prices:

-

{Eqlp2 (R2q2 Eq2q2) + Eqlq2(Eq2p2
—

{(Rlql Eqlql)(Eq2p2 R222) +

R22 2)} >

E12

(15)

(16)

According to equation (15), if the public expects of the imposition of

a future tariff, and as long as there is gross substitutability among M

and N (i.e.,

E

2 2

>0), there will be an appreciation of the equilib-

qp

rium real exchange rate in the current period. Of course, the mechanism via
which this takes place is the intertemporal substitution in consumption,

captured in equation (15) by terms E

Equation (16) states that under our assumptions, an (anticipated) imposition
of a period 2 tariff will also result in an equilibrium appreciation in that

period. From an inspection of (15) and (16) it is apparent that it is not

possible to know whether q will go up by more in period 1 or 2. Again,
then, we have the possibility of "overshooting" or other "puzzling" time
paths for the equilibrium RER.

111.4 Permanent Tariff Change and the Eauilibrium Real Exchanze Rate
If tariffs are changed permanently, then dr1 —

dr2.

Under the

assumption of very small initial tariffs the effect on q1 and q2 will be
given by:

Then, under gross substitutability in demand everywhere, both of these
terms are positive, indicating that the imposition of a permanent tariff

will result in a real appreciation in both periods. Whether this real
appreciation will be larger in period I or in period 2, will depend on:

+

(Rlq1 Eqlql)(Eq2pl +

It is interesting to compare the reaction of the RER in period 1 for

the cases of temporary and a permanent tariffs. From equations (17) and
(11), and maintaining the assunption of gross substitutability, we find
unequivocally that a permanent tariff will appreciate the equilibrium real
exchange rate in period 1 by more than a temporary tariff imposed in that

period only. In fact (17) can be rewritten as:

IV. Terms
In

of Trade Shocks and the Ecuilibrium Real Exchange Rate

this

section we investigate how exogenous changes in international

terms of trade (p and P) affect the equilibrium path of the real
exchange rate. As in the preceding section the discussion will focus on
three cases:

(1) temporary terms of trade worsening (i.e., increase in

(2) anticipated future terms of trade worsening (increase in p);
and (3) permanent terms of trade worsening (equiproportional increase in

p- and p). Throughout the section we assume that initial tariffs are
very low, so that we can evaluate our derivatives around

—

0.

IV.l Temporary Terms of Trade Shocks

r2

From (8), under the assumption that

0, we obtain that the

vector of equilibrium RERs will react to a temporary increase in the inter-

national terms of trade (pr)

in

the following way:

Eq2ql E1

A number of important results emerge from these equations. First, due
to the existence of foreign borrowing a temporary terms of trade shock that
increases the international price of importables today only, will affect
both the current and future equilibrium value of the real exchange rate.

20

Second, contrary to the case of a temporary tariff, even under the

assumption of ross substitutability everywhere, we now cannot sign these
expressions. The reason for this is, of course, that in addition to the
substitution effects, we now have a (negative) first order income effect

associated to the worsening of the terms of trade. These income effects are
given by the second RHS term in equations (20) and (21). As is usually the
case they are proportional to the level of imports in period 1 (E
p
*1
1
If the income effect dominates the substitution effect, (dq /dp )

1

R
p

-

can be

negative even if we assume gross substitutability in consumption everywhere.
The reason, of course, is that the worsening of the terms of trade will
result in a decline in demand for all goods in every period, generating a
downward pressure on the relative price of nontradables in all periods.
In order to highlight the relation between tariffs and terms of trade

effects, we can rewrite equation (20) in the following way (a corresponding
expression can be written for equation (21)):

-

dp*l

— () (E1-

R11) {Eqlq2 2 E2 +

El(R2q2 Eq2q2)} (22)

where, clearly the RHS of equation (22) is negative under our assumptions
regarding substitutability in demand.

IV.2 Antjcthated Future Worsening in the Terms of Trade
If in period 1 people anticipate that there will be a worsening of the
terms of trade in the future, they will want to immediately adjust to it.

The RER in period 1 will respond in the following way to an anticipated
increase in the international price of imports:

21

The first term on the RHS corresponds to the substitution effect and it
is exactly the same as in the case of the imposition of a fully anticipated

tariff (see equation 15 above). Under our maintained assumption of gross

substitutability, it is positive. As before the mechanisms via which
today's prices react to anticipated changes in future terms of trade are the

intertemporal substitution effects E

1 2

qp

and E 1 2' clearly, if there is

qq

no intertemporal substitution this first term will be equal to zero. The
second term on the RES is the discounted (negative) income effect generated
by the future anticipated worsening of the terms of trade, and is

proportional to the present value of imports in period 2. This second term
is negative, generating forces towards a decline in equilibrium relative

price of nontradables in the current period. The reason for this is that
households try smooth consumption through time; the lower real income in the

future, results in lower demand for N both in the present and in the
future.

IV.3 Permanent Terms of Trade Shock
Equations (24) and (25) capture the effect of a permanent terms of
trade shock on the vector of equilibrium RERs.

where dq1/dr and dq2/dr are the pure substitution effects, and are given
by equations (17) and (18) above. Under our simplifying assumptions of
substitutability, these are positive. Notice that now the negative income
effects are proportional to the present value of total imports. Again, as
in the case of tariffs it is not possible to know a priori which relative
price of nontradables will be affected by more as a result of a permanent
terms of trade shock.

V. Terms of Trade Shocks and the Current Account
More than thirty-five years ago Laursen and Metzler (1950) and
Harberger (1950) established conditions under which terms of trade shocks

would worsen the current account, using essentially static models. More
recently, Obstfel (1982) Svensson and Razin (1983), and Persson and Svensson
(1985) have relooked at the relation between terms of trade shocks and the
current account using models where intertemporal considerations are expli-

citly taken into account. The specific question asked in these papers was:
since the current account is equal to the difference between savings and
investment, what are the mechanisms through which a terms of trade shock

will affect these intertemporal decisions? Neither of these pieces,
however, considered the case of home goods, where terms of trade shocks can
have additional effects via changes in the RER.
Equations (26) and (27) provide expressions for changes in period l's
current account as a result of temporary and permanent terms of trade shocks

It is clear from equation (26), that in the present model it is not
possible to know with certainty whether a temporary worsening in the terms

of trade will improve or worsen the current account. The first three BBS
terms of equation (26) are equivalent to those in equation (14) for the
temporary tariff case, and their economic interpretation is virtually the

same.'2 The fourth RBS term in (26) is equal to period 1 imports and since
it is preceded by a minus sign, it is negative. The last RHS term in (26)
captures the (negative) income effect generated by a deterioration of the

terms of trade, and is positive since (dW/dpi*) < 0 (i.e., the negative
terms of trade shock reduces aggregate utility and real income.) These last
two terms capture the fact that since as a result of the negative terms of
trade shock, the country is poorer, expenditure will go down both in

periods 1 and 2, generating forces towards improving the current account in
period 1.

Equation (27) provides the response of the current account in period 1

to a permanent terms of trade shock. Notice that as before this expression
cannot be signed unequivocally. In this model, even if there is a permanent
terms of trade shock we cannot know p rior1. whether the first period
current account will improve or worsen. What we do know, from (27),

24

however, is that whatever the sign is, it will be smaller than in the case

of a temporary shock only. The reason for this, of course, is that
(5* ir1E12 it22)

is

negative. That is, a permanent negative terms of

trade shock will either worsen the current account by more, or improve it by

less, than a temporary shock. The reason for this is that when the terms of
trade shock is permanent, the negative income effect affects both periods,

and there is no intertemporal substitution of expenditure for consumption
smoothing reasons.

Equation (28) provides the response of period l's current account to an
anticipated future deterioration of the terms of trade in period 2, and
again cannot be signed a priori:

Extensions

The model derived above can be extended easily to handle a number of
important questions related to the reaction of the equilibrium RERs and of

the current account to different shocks. In this section we sketch some of
the possible extensions of the model.

VI.1 Transfers
The model easily captures the effects of transfers from abroad on the

vector of equilibrium real exchange rates. A transfer, denoted by H, in

period 1 will have the following effect on q1 and q2, in the more
general case of nonzero initial tariffs:

25

() ((Rlql

Eqlql)2 E2w + Eqlq2

> 0

(29)

0

(30)

i E) >

That is a positive temporary transfer from abroad will uniequivocally

appreciate the real exchange rate in both periods. The reason, of course,
is that the transfer will result in higher present value of real income, a
fraction of which will be spent in nontradables in each period, exercising

upward pressure on their relative prices. Totice that if the propensities
to spend on nontradables in both periods are zero (i.e.,

either period. The case of an anticipated future transfer is straightforward, and can be easily shown that it will also appreciate the current

and future RER. Although transfers will result in an equilibrium real

appreciation, in the present model they will always be welfare improving.
V.2

Factor

13

Price Rigidities

All of the exercises performed above have assumed that all prices,

including those of factors, are fully flexible. This is not always the

case, especially in the developing countries. Rigidities in some factor
prices can be easily introduced into the analysis. Assume, for example,

that the (real) wage rate (w) is fixed at a level w RL, where R
the unconstrained revenue function, and L is the labor force. In this
case, then, we have to define a constrained revenue function (R) (Neary
1985)

R(',p,q,K) — max {(QXqQNpQN)
Q,L

-

L)

(31)

26

where Q1,

i

X,M,N refers to output of exportables, importables and

nontradables. Also, the rtontradable market equilibrium conditions are
replaced by:

R

(32)

E11; R2 - E22

where R1. is the partial derivative of the constrained revenue function
q

(31) with respect to the price of nontradables in period i. Neary (1985)
has shown that under fixed factor prices the following relation exists
between restricted and unrestricted revenue functions:
R =

R[q,p,L(w,q,p,K)]

-

wL(w,q,p,K)

(33)

where L is the amount of labor employed in the constrained case. Once the
revenue functions have been redefined in this way it is easy to find how the
relative price of nontradables reacts to a tariff reduction in an economy
with fix real wages.

VI.3 Tariffs. Real Exchange Rates and Employment
For a number of years trade theorists have been preoccupied with the
relation between tariffs and employment (Mundell 1963; Eichengreen 1981;

Kimbrough 1984; van Wijnbergen 1986). In the model developed in this paper,
if wages are flexible, tariffs have no effects on aggregate employment.
However, if there is real wage rigidity of the type described in Section
VI.2 above, tariffs will indeed have an effect on the level of total

employment in the economy. For example, equation (34) gives the response of
labor employed in period 1 to a temporary tariff in that period.

where the term (d/dr1) captures the change in the relative price of T

and R11

are Rybczinski

Lq

type terms whose signs will depend on factor intensities. Depending on the

sign of d&/dr1 and on factor intensities in the different sectors
(dL1/dr1) can be positive or negative.

VI.4 Welfare Effects of Temporal Trade Liberalization
One of the advantages of the intertemporal framework based on duality
theory developed in this paper is that it can be readily used to investigate
the effects on welfare of alternative policies or exogenous disturbances. A
particularly interesting question relates to the welfare effects of temporal

trade liberalization. Economists have argued, for many years, that developing countries should reduce import tariffs and become more integrated to the

rest of the world. Moreover, in the recent years a number of poor countries
have in fact pursued policies aimed at reducing barriers to international

trade. Many of these liberalization attempts, however, have been only
temporary. For diverse reasons, after some time with lower tariffs, the
liberalization reform is reversed, with tariffs being hiked once again to

their old level. The question, then, is whether these temporary trade
liberalizations are in fact welfare improving.14 This question can be
easily answered using the system depicted in (8) in Section 2 above. It is
easy to show that if

> 0

a reduction in

conditions, be welfare reducing (i.e., dW/dr1 <

only may, under plausible

0).

This suggests that if

the possibilities of a reversal of the trade reform are high, it may not be
convenient to attempt a temporary tariff reduction.

28

VI.5

Intermediate Inputs and Import Quotas
The intertemporal duality approach used here can be easily extended in

order to incorporate import quotas and intermediate inputs. First, the case
import quotas can be analyzed in a quite straightforward fashion by defining
"virtual prices" as in Neary and Roberts (1980). The use of virtual prices,
of course, assumes that the quota is allocated competitively via an auction
mechanism.

Intermediate goods can also be incorporated quite easily through the

definition of net-outputs as in Dixit and Norman (1980). In this case an
additional source of ambiguity with respect to the sign of dq/dr
15

emerges.

VI.6 Investment
Since the discussion presented above has ignored investment, the
current account in each period is equal to savings in that particular

period. Investment, however, can be introduced in a straightforward
fashion. Moreover, its incorporation will not alter in a significant way
the main results presented above. Once investment is added to the analysis,
the intertemporal budget constraint has to be altered and an equation
describing the process governing investment decisions has to be added to our

system. Denoting investment by I and assuming that there is time to
build, the intertempora]. budget constraint becomes (where V1 is the vector
of factors of production other than capital):
R1(1 ,q1,p1;K1,V1) +

E[ir1(l,p1,q1) ,5*1r2(l,p2,q2)

-

1(6*)

,w}

—

(35)

29

Further assuming that investment decisions are governed by the condition

that in equilibrium Tobin's "q" equals 1, and that investment goods
correspond to the numeraire good, the investment equation is:

5*R —

1

(36)

The manipulation of (35), (36) and the two conditions for equilibrium in the
nontraded goods market in period 1 and 2 (equations (2) and (3)), will now
yield the corresponding expressions for changes in the RERs and the capital
account.

VI.7 World Interest Rates and Exchange Controls
The model of the preceding sections assumes that there is perfect

capital mobility. However it can be easily amended to incorporate the case
where capital flows are taxed. If this tax is prohibitive and there is no
foreign borrowing, the model requires a period-by-period equilibrium in both

the tradables and nontradables sector. This model has been discussed in
detail by Edwards (1987).
The case of a non-prohibitive tax on capital movements can also be

incorporated into the analysis. Under these circumstances the domestic

discount factor is 6 <

5*,

and (the present value of) the tax on foreign

borrowing per unit borrowed is equal to b —

(6*

-

6) —

(r.r*)/(l+r)(l+r*).

In this case the intertemporal budget constraint has to be modified in two

ways. First, 6* has to be replaced by 6. Second, under the assumption
that the proceeds from this tax on foreign borrowing are returned to the

private sector in a nondistortionary way, a tax proceeds term b(R2- ir2E2)
has to be added to the RNS of equation (1).

An interesting exercise is to investigate the form in which a change in

the tax on foreign borrowing b affects the equilibrium RER. Edwards

30

(1987) has in fact shown that with no investment an increase in & - -

- will

is a liberalization of the capital account -

that

always result in a real

appreciation in period 1.

VI.8 Fiscal Deficits and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
The analysis presented above has ignored the government sector.

However, a policy question that has become increasingly important in the
last year or so relates to the role of changes in fiscal policy on the

equilibrium path of RERs.16 The model in this paper can be extended easily

to analyze the role of fiscal policy. This, of course, will require adding
the government budget constraint. Perhaps one of the more convenient ways
to proceed is by assuming that the government finances its expenditures both
by using the proceeds from the import tariffs and by borrowing from abroad.
On the expenditure side it can be assumed that the government consumes both

importables and nontradables. If the government consumption of tradables

and nontradables in period i are denoted by G1j and G, its
(intertemporal) budget constraint is written as:

rl[Rl1 E1) + s*r2[R22

E2] p1G + q1G

÷ &*(p2G+q2G)

(37)

where the LHS is the discounted value of income from taxation and the RHS is

the present value of government expenditure. After amending the private
sector budget constraint and the equilibrium conditions in the nontradable

markets, it is straightforward to find how changes in composition, size and
financing of government consumption affects the RER and the current account.
Notice, however, that in this case both tariffs and all of the government

consumption cannot be exogenous. Now, in order to assure that (37) holds,
has to be endogenous.

31

VII.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper an optimizing intertemporal real model of a small open
economy has been developed to investigate how various exogenous shocks

affect the path of the equilibrium real exchange rate and the current

account. It is assumed that firms produce competitively three goods --

exports,

imports and nontradables. Households maximize the present value of

utility, and consume all three goods. They have access to the international
capital market, where they can borrow or lend at the given world interest

rate. The only constraint they face is that the present value of the current account balances has to be zero. The model uses duality theory and
exploits the properties of exact price indexes as developed by Svensson and
Razin (1983).

The effects of both changes in import tariffs and of exogenous shocks

to the international terms of trade were investigated, with emphasis placed
on the distinction between temporary, permanent, anticipated and unantici-

pated disturbances. It was shown that in an intertemporal model with three
goods a crucial channel through which exogenous shocks are transmitted is

the consumption rate of interest (CR1). Changes in tariffs or the
international terms of trade will affect the CR1, intertemporal expenditure
decisions, and consequently the equilibrium vector of RERs and the current
account.

It is shown that in the more general case - -

where initial tariffs are

high and where no restrictions are placed on the cross price derivatives in
demand -

- it

is not possible to know how changes in tariffs or the terms of

trade will affect the equilibrium path of the RER. This result is important, and contradicts the traditional policy oriented literature which claims

that a hike in import tariffs result in a real appreciation. However, under

32

some (plausible) restrictions in the intertemporal model - -

gross

- it

substitutability, in demand everywhere and no initial tariffs -

is

possible to establish some important unambiguous results. The imposition of
import tariffs - -

either

temporary or permanent -

- will

result in a real

appreciation in both periods.

It is also shown that in this explicit general equilibrium
intertemporal model with nontradable goods it is not possible to determine

priori the reaction of the current account to a tariff or a terms of trade

change. Specific conditions for a current account improvement are derived.
In the final section several directions in which the model can be extended

are sketched, including the case of exchange controls, wage rigidity, and
import quotas, and fiscal policies.

Stability Conditions

In order to simplify the analysis of the stability conditions, and to
sign the determinant, it is assumed that tariffs and the international terms

of trade don't change. Thus, irnportables and exportables can be grouped

into a composite called tradables. We denote the relative price of

nontradables to tradables by f.
The dynamic behavior of nontradable prices are depicted by equations

1See, for example, Williamson (1983), Marris (1985).
2There are some models that analyze the behavior of equilibrium RERs

within a macroeconomic context. See, for example, Hooper and Roper (1982),
and Mussa (1986).

3Naturally, a model like the one presented here is too abstract to be

directly applied to policy evaluation of RER behavior. It does provide,
however, a number of important insights on the way exogenous shocks affect
the eQuilibrium RER.

4For a related model with exchange controls see Edwards (1987).
50n the use of duality in static models of international trade see

Dixit and Norman (1980). Svensson and Razin (1983) and Edwards and van
Wijnbergen (1986) use duality in intertemporal models without nontradables.
6Notice that given the assumptions of our model, for this definition of
equilibrium RER vector implies full employment.
7Notice that ir
E . — CiEEW, where CiE is the marginal propensity
irW
p
to consume on imported goods in period 1 (Edwards and van Wijnbergen 1986).

8Dornbusch (1980) and Corden (1985) assume no income effects in their

static models. The negative sign of

follows from stability (see

Appendix 2).

9The intertemporal nature of this effect can be illustrated better by

using the homogeneity property ,rE11 ÷ ir2E12 — 0,

to replace E11

in equation (14). Then this expression becomes:

Notice that if there is no intertemporal substitution, that is if E12 —

0,

the imposition of a tariff has no effect whatsoever on the current

account.

10See Dornbusch (1980) for a good discussion on the more traditional
models.

111f the period specific substitutability functions are identical and
there is no technological change these two terms will be equal, and

12The main difference is that now the indirect RER effect comes about
*1
via the impact of changes in p

on the vector of q's.

131n the small country case any transfer used for consumption purposes
only are always welfare enhancing.
14Perhaps the best examples of temporal trade liberalization are those

of the Southern Cone of Latin America. See Edwards (1985) and Calvo
(l986a). For theoretical analyses on the welfare effects of temporal trade
reforms see Calvo (1985, l986b).

16See Feldstein (1986) for a discussion of the relation between the

U.S. fiscal deficit and the real value of the dollar. Frenkel and Razin
(1986) have analyzed theoretically a number of issues related to fiscal
policies in the world's economy.
