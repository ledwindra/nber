    "abstract": "\n\nWe study whether actions are justified by beliefs, as is usually assumed, or whether beliefs are justified by actions.  In our experiment, subjects participate in a trust game, after which they have an opportunity to state their beliefs about their opponent's actions. Subsequently, subjects participate in a task designed to \"reveal\" their true beliefs.  We find that subjects who make selfish choices and show strategic sophistication falsely state their beliefs in order to project a more favorable social image. By contrast, their \"revealed\" beliefs were significantly more accurate, which betrayed these subjects as knowing that their selfishness was not justifiable by their opponent's behavior.\n\n",
