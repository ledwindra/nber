    "abstract": "\n\nWe use an iterative relocation algorithm to identify factors in common stock returns.  The benefit of the approach is that factors are portfolios of assets with non-negative weights.  As a result, they are readily interpreted in terms of their characteristics of the underlying securities.  The positive portfolio factors have comparatively high explanatory power in sample and out-of-sample.  We find evidence of a size factor and factors identified with certain industries.  Factors extracted from the mutual fund universe perform marginally better than factors from the universe of equities.\n\n",
