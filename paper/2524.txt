Takeover Bids Below the Expected Value of Minority Shares

ABSTRACT

Focussing on takeover bids whose outcome can be predicted in advance

with certainty, Grossman and Hart estsblished the proposition, which
subsequent work accepted, that successful bids must be made at or above the
expected value of minority shares. This proposition provided the basis for
Grossman and Hart's identification of a free-rider problem and became a
major premise for the analyaia of takeovers. This paper showa that this
important proposition does not always hold once we drop the assumption that
the only successful bida are those whose success could have been predicted
with certainty. In particular, it is shown that any unconditional bid that
is below the expected value of minority shares but above the independent
target's per share value will succeed with a certain positive probability;
that the bidder's expected payoff from such a bid (not counting the
transaction costs of making the bid) is always positive; and that bidders
might elect to make such bids. These results have implications for the
nature of the free-rider problem and for the operation of takeovers; in
particular, it ia shown that, when a raider can increaae the value of a
target's assets, the raider might elect to bid even if no dilution of
minority shares is possible and it holds no initial stake in the target.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

tn

an already classic paper, Grossman and Hart (1980) developed a model

of takeover bids and stimulated much theoretical work on the subject (see,
Harris and Raviv (1986),

eg.,

Vishny (1986),

P'ng (1985),

Scharfstein (1987), Shleifer and

and the survey by Dreyfus (1986)). Focussing their analysis

on bids whose outcome can be predicted in advance with certainty, GrossmanHart established the proposition, which subsequent work accepted, that
successful bids must be made at or above the expected value of minority
shares. This proposition led to Grossman and Hart's insightful observation
that a free-rider problem exists, and it was used by them and subsequently
by others to analyze the operation of takeovers. This paper shows that this
important proposition does not always hold once we drop the assumption that
the only successful bids are those whose success could have been predicted
with certainty. It is shown that certain bids below the expected value of
minority shares may succeed with a certain positive probability, that such
bids may be profitable and may be used by bidders, and that these
possibilities have implications for the nature of the free-rider problem and
for the operation of takeovers.
Suppose that the value of a target's assets is V0 per share under the
present management, and that under the control of a given "raider" the value
of these assets would increase to Vt per share. Suppose also that the
expected value of minority shares in the event of a takeover, Vm, exceeds
because "dilution" of the value of minority shares would either be
impossible or at least possible only to a limited extent

Grossman and Hart,

assuming that the only successful bids are those whose success can be
predicted with certainty, showed that a takeover bid by the raider at any
price below Vu cannot succeed.

A

success with certainty, they pointed out,

cannot be a rational expectations outcome of a bid below Vm: for supposing
1

that a takeover is going to take place, each atomistic shareholder will
prefer to hold out and end up with a minority share worth

rather

thar,

have his share acquired for the lower bid price. Thus, minority
shareholders' ability to free ride on the raider's improvement (at least in
part> would rule out a takeover at any price below

even if this offered

price exceeds the target's independent value V0.
An important implication that Grossman-Hart drew from their conclusion

that only bids at or above Vm can succeed concerns the special case in whic
no dilution is possible (i.e., Vm=Vt). In this case, Grossman-Hart
suggested, the raider would not be able to make any gain on shares acquired
through a successful takeover bid. Therefore, since there are costs to
making a bid, the raider would not bid, and the absence of dilution would
thus prevent a value-increasing takeover from taking place.
The significance of the Grossman-Hart conclusions concerning the
outcome of bids below Vm has been well recognized. The free-rider corollary
--

that

without dilution a raider would be unable to profit on shares

acquired through

a

bid

-

- motivated, and served as a useful
starting point

for, an examination of what explains the making of takeover bids, Grossman

and Hart (1980) suggested that bids are made because legal rules and charter
provisions do enable acquirers to dilute the value of minority shares; and
Shleifer and Vishny (1986) demonstrated that a raider that holds a stake in
the target prior to bidding will gain from the appreciation of its initial
stake (even if it makes no gain on shares acquired through its bid).
Furthermore, the Grossman-Hart proposition has been an important premise of
subsequent models of the case in which some dilution is possible (which has
beer, generally regarded, following Grossman and Hart, to be the common

case)

that bids below

m cannot succeed has been

generally assumed by

analysts modelling the operation and outcome of bids.

2

This paper drops the Grossman-Hart assUniption that the only successful
bids are those whose success could have been predicted with certainty, and
it then reconsiders the prospects, profitability, and use of bids below
Vm.
It is shown that any bid below

but above V0 may succeed if the bid is

is, a bid committing the bidder to purchase tendered

shares even if the bid fails. The intuition behind this result can be stated
briefly as follows. In the case of an unconditional bid below

but above

V0, although certain success of the bid is not a rational equilibrium
outcome, neither is a certain failure. Non-tendering is not an equilibrium
strategy for the target's shareholders because, if other shareholders are
going to hold out and the bid is going to fail, each atomistic shareholder
will prefer to tender and have his share acquired for a price
exceeding the
target's independent value V0. Such an unconditional bid has a unique
symmetric equilibrium, which I identify and characterize, in which
shareholders use mixed strategies and the bid may consequently either
succeed or fail.
Furthermore, I show that unconditional bids below

V but

above Vo may

he profitable and consequently may be used
by bidders. Although such a bid
would produce a loss if the bid fails and the bidder must purchase shares at
a price exceeding
V0, the expected payoff from the bid, exclusive of the
transaction costs of making the bid, is shown to be always positive. To
examine when such bids will be used, I analyze when their expected
payoff
will exceed both the costs of making the bid and the expected
payoff from
bidding at or above

V.

In particular, I show that, in the absence of

dilution, a raider that can increase the value of the target's assets may
hid even if it holds no initial stake in the target; and that,

in the

presence of some dilution, a bidder may elect to bid below Vm, even though
such a bid would not succeed with certainty as would a bid at
Vm.

Section II analyzes the case in which no dilution is possible and
Section III analyzes the case in which some dilution is possible. Section IV
then makes concluding remarks concerning the implications of the paper's
analysis.

I shall call "the raider" --

the per share improvement that a takeover by the raider can produce.
In the event of a takeover, the bidder will be unable to dilute the
value of minority shares. Thus, minority shares will have a per share value
of
The target has

N

shares, where

N

is large. The raider will have control

if and only if it owns at least kN shares, where O<k<l indicates the
fraction of shares necessary for control. The raider is assumed, for
simplicity of exposition, to hold no initial stake in the target. (The
analysis can be adjusted to apply to the case in which the raider owns
initially some non-controlling fraction s (s<k) of the target's shares.)
Each share of the target is held by one shareholder. Because

N

is

large, I shall assume, like Grossman and Hart, that the atomistic
shareholders ignore the possibility that their decision will determine the
outcome of a bid. Dropping this assumption would make the analysis more
complicated but would not change its conclusions.
It is

assumed,

as in Grossman-Hart, that, if the raider does bid and

its bid fails, the per share value of the target's shares will be the
"status quo'

value

of V0.

That

is, should the

4

bid

fail,

investors will not

expect the failing bidder (or another bidder) to make a subsequent bid; If
the raider's failing bid requires it to purchase some shares, the raider is
expected to (or even has committed itself to) sell those shares on the
market or hold them as a non-controlling block.
In the event that the raider elects to bid, B will denote the bid
price. For any bid B,

b

will denote the value of (B-V0)/I; that is, b is the

fraction of the takeover improvement that is offered by the raider as a
premium.
T will denote the number of shares attracted by a bid. We shall
consider two kinds of bids: conditional, where the raider is willing to buy
shares only if T>kN, and unconditional, where no such condition is attached.
The total cost to the raider of making a bid is C, The raider will of
course elect to bid only if the expected profit on shares purchased through
the bid exceeds C.
It is easy to see that,

although a bid with

BVt

would succeed, it

would not provide the raider with any gain on shares purchased through the
hid. Thus, we should consider whether the bidder can make a gain by bidding
below

V.

In particular, since it is clear that any bid below
V0 would

attract no shares, we should focus on bids that are below
Vt but not below

B. Conditional

Bid Below Vt Cannot Succeed

It is worth starting the analysis with conditional bids, the case in
which the proposition that bids below

cannot succeed does always hold.

Consider a bid with VO<B<Vt that is conditional on TkN.

In this

situation, the dominant strategy of each atomistic shareholder will be to

tender.

In the event that the bid fails, the shareholder's tender decision

will not matter; whether he tenders or holds out, his share will not be

5

acquired. In the event that the bid succeeds, non-tendering (and thus ending
up with Vt) is clear].y preferable to tendering (and having one's share
acquired for B<Vt). Thus, we have the following proposition.
Proposition j: Any bid VO<B<Vt (Ob<l) which is conditional on the bidder's
gaining control (TkN) will fail.
C. Unconditional Bids

below Vt

Succeed

Let us now consider the outcome of a bid VO<B<Vt that is unconditional..
In this situation, there is no equilibrium in pure strategies.
Non-tendering is no longer an equilibrium strategy (as it was in the
case of a conditional bid). For, assuming that other shareholders are going
to hold out, a shareholder will not be indifferent between tendering and
holding out (as he was in the case of a conditional bid): he will prefer to
tender and have his share acquired for B rather than remain with a share in
the independent target worth V0.

As to tendering, it is not an equilibrium strategy for the same
reasons as in the case of a conditional bid. Assuming that others are going
to tender and

a

takeover is going to take place, a shareholder will prefer

to hold out and end up with a minority share worth

V rather

than tender and

have his share acquired for the lower bid price of B.
it remains then to consider the possibility of an equilibrium in mixed
strategies. Focussing on the possibility of a symmetric equilibrium, let us
consider the shareholder strategy of tendering with probability t and
holding out with probability l-t, where O<t<l. If all the shareholders
follow this strategy, the likelihood of a takeover will be

Proposition 3: The expected payoff to the bidder (not counting the costs of

Remark: The result in Proposition 3 can be intuitively explained as follows.
If the bidder expected to purchase the same number of shares whether the bid
succeeds or fails, then his expected payoff, per share to be purchased,
would

be

Pr(r)(Vt-B)

[l-Pr(r)](B-V).

But the fact that r is an

equilibrium strategy (i.e., that shareholders are indifferent between
tendering and holding out) implies that this payoff would be zero. Thus,
because the bidder can expect to purchase more shares in the event that the
bid succeeds (TK)

that in the event that the bid fails (T<K), it follows

that the bidder faces a positive expected payoff.

The first expression on the right-hand side of (10) can be shown to

and the right-hand side of (11) is clearly positive.

E. The Optimal

Bid

Supposing that the raider is going to make an unconditional bid
VO<B<Vt,

its

optimal bid is given by the solution to the problem

max W(B)
B

(12)

Solving this maximization problem provides the following proposition,
which is proven in the Appendix.
Proposition 4: The optimal bid is one offering a premium
equal to half of the potential improvement (B =(V+V0)/2)

.

In

the face of

this bid, each shareholder will tender with probability equal to the
control fraction (r=k), and the bid will succeed with likelihood 1/2.

F. The

Incentive to Bid

We can now determine when the raider will elect to

bid (even though

there is no dilution). If the raider does bid, it will offer, by proposition
4, a price of (Vt+V0)/2. Substituting this value for B in (11) and making

Since the raider will bid if and only if the expected payoff given by
(13) exceeds the cost C of making the bid, we have the following

proposition.

For example, supposing that N=l000 and k=l/2, a bid will take place if
and only C is no larger than 0,6% of the total improvement to be produced.
III. BIDDING WHEN SOME DILUTION IS POSSIBLE

Let us now consider the case in which dilution of the value of minority
shares would be possible to some extent. Specifically, suppose that in the
event of a takeover the raider would be able to dilute the value of each
minority share by an amount 0, where I>D>0. Thus, (1-0)

is that part of the

improvement produced by a takeover that the raider would be unable to deny
minority shareholders, and on which these shareholders could thus free ride.
Thus,

may succeed (see Bebchuk

V

11

As before, the interest is in examining bids with Vo<B<Vm. In
particular, we shall examine whether such bids may succeed and whether
raiders will choose to make such bids.

A. The Outcome

of Bids Below Ve

The analysis of the outcome of a bid below Vm can proceed in the same
way as it proceeded in Section II. For the analysis of bid outcomes in
section II depended only on the relationship between B, V0, and the expected
value of minority shares Vm; Vt appeared in that analysis only because,
given the assumption of no dilution, Vm was equal to Vt.

A

bid below Vm that is conditional on the bidder's gaining control is

bound to fail,

for the same reasons as those identified in Section II. Non-

tendering is a dominant strategy, because (i) assuming that the bid is going
to fail (and tendered shares are consequently going to be returned), a
shareholder will be indifferent between tendering and non-tendering, and
(ii) assuming that the bid is going to succeed, a shareholder will prefer to

remain with minority shares worth Vm than to have his share purchased for a
price below that value. Thus, we have

Proposition

:

Any bid with B<Vm which

is conditional on the bidder's

gaining control (TkN) will fail.

In the case of an unconditional bid below

Vm

there is no equilibrium

in pure strategies, for the same reasons as those discussed in Section II.
Supposing that other shareholders are going to tender, a shareholder will
prefer to hold out; and supposing that other shareholders are going to hold
out,

a

shareholder will prefer to tender. Proceeding in the same way as in

Section II, we find that there is a unique symmetric equilibrium in mixed
strategies which is characterized by the following proposition.

12

Proposition 1: For any unconditional bid Vo<B<Vm, there is a unique symmetric

equilibrium,

Thus, the likelihood that an unconditional bid is going to succeed is
equal to the ratio of the premium offered to that part of the improvement
that minority shareholders can capture.

B. The Expected Payoff from Bidding below
When a bidder makes an unconditional bid Vo<B<Vm, there are two
possible outcomes. If the bid fails which has a likelihood of

(VmB)/(VmVo), the bidder will lose (B-V0) on each tendered share. If the
bid succeeds, which has a likelihood of (BVo)/(VnVo), the bidder will make
a gain of

(V-V0) on each tendered share and in addition a gain of 0 on each

non-tendered share, Since Vt-B = D + (VmB), the bidder's gain in the event
of a takeover can be alternatively described as a gain of 0 on all of the
target's shares and in addition a gain of (VmB) on each tendered share,
Thus, the bidder's expected payoff from the bid (not counting the costs of
making the bid) will be

0. The Possible Use of Bids Below Vm

In the case in which no dilution is possible, the only two options of
the bidder that required our consideration were bidding below
Vm and not
bidding; for, in the absence of dilution, the bidder could not make any gain
on shares acquired through a bid at or above Vm=Vt. Thus, the bidder's
choice was

below

determined by comparing the

maximum

expected payoff from bidding

with the cost of making a bid. In ths case in which dilution is

possible, however, a bid at

Vm=VtID

will provide the bidder with a gain of

D*N (not counting the costs of making the bid). Thus,

14

it is necessary to

examine whether a bid below

will ever be more profitable than a bid at

Vm. As will be seen below, the answer to this question is affirmative.

that bidding at V

could produce. On the other hand, the lower bid may

succeed; in this case, lowering the bid would produce a saving of x on each
share purchased through the successful bid.
We have seen that in the no-dilution case of 0=0,
Vm=Vt, it would be
indeed optimal for the bidder to lower its bid from

to (Vm+Vo)/2

In

comparison to this no-dilution case, the presence of dilution increases the
cost of lowering the bid from

in the presence of dilution,

a

bid at Vm

would produce a gain of DN, and any lowering of the bid from this level
would increase the likelihood of losing this potential gain. Thus, it seems
reasonable to suspect that whether the optimal bid would be lower than V
and, if so, by how much

-

- would depend on the size of 0 relative to

I. In

particular, it seems reasonable to suspect that increasing 0 makes it less
likely that the optimal bid will be below Vm or, if the optimal bid is below
Vm,

that the optimal bid fall below Vm by a substantial margin. And indeed,

such a relationship is suggested by the following two propositions, which
are proven in the appendix.

IV,CONCLUDING

R.IARKS

This paper has extended the Grossman-Hart analysis to allow for bids
whose outcome cannot be predicted in advance with certainty. It has been
shown that, once such bids are introduced, the proposition that all
successful bids must be made at or above the expected value of minority
shares does not always hold. Bids below the expected value of minority
shares may succeed, may be profitable, and may be used.
A crucial distinction that the analysis has highlighted is the
difference in consequences between conditional bids and unconditional bids
While conditional bids below Vm cannot succeed, unconditional bids may. The
power of unconditional bids results from the fact that they offer
shareholders the prospect of having their shares acquired even if the bid
fails. Because of shareholders' desire to have their shares acquired in such
a case,

a

failure with certainty cannot be

a

rational expectations outcome

of an unconditional bid. Thus, what might enable such a bid to succeed is
the possibility that it will fail.

16

Note that the paper's analysis assumed that all the target's
shareholders have the same information. In this framework, the sharehoifers
uncertainty about the bid's outcome (which led some of them to tender) was
solely rooted in their use of mixed strategies. It should be possible,
however, to construct a model in which the shareholders' uncertainty about
the outcome is rooted, at least in part,

in differences among the

shareholders in their estimates of Vm or Vt.
It should be emphasized that, although the Grossman-Hart conclusions
concerning takeover bids must be refined in the way described above, the
main insights offered by their analysis do remain: the importance of
dilution in inducing bids, and the importance of the expected value of
minority shares in determining tender offers and bid outcomes. In
particular, although it was shown that bids might be made even in the
absence of dilution, there should be no question that the presence of
dilution is very important in explaining takeover bids.

The sign of the right-hand side of (A3) depends on the sign of the sum in
the braces (since all the terms outside the braces are positive)
large, the value of the sum

in braces

Since N is

(largely) depends on the second

expression in the braces. And the second expression is positive for r<k and
negative for r>k. Thus, the optimal B is that (approximately) which would
produce a r equal to k.
Finally, from (2) it follows that the probability of a takeover
associated with r=k is 1/2. And from (5) it follows that the B which will
produce such r and Pr(r) is

The first expression is the loss of the potential profit that a bid at Vm
would produce, and the second expression is the expected loss on the shares
that would have to be purchased through the failing bid.
On the other hand, the lower bid might also succeed with probability
in which case lowering the bid would produce a saving of

(VmVoE))/(VmVo),

on each share purchased through the bid. Denoting by

T

the expected

number of tendered shares in the event that the bid succeeds, the gain from
lowering the bid in the event that the bid succeeds is
