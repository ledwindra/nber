Populism and the Return of the “Paranoid Style”: Some Evidence and a Simple Model of Demand
for Incompetence as Insurance against Elite Betrayal

ABSTRACT
We present a simple model of populism as the rejection of “disloyal” leaders. We show that adding
the assumption that people are worse off when they experience low income as a result of leader betrayal
(than when it is the result of bad luck) to a simple voter choice model yields a preference for incompetent
leaders. These deliver worse material outcomes in general, but they reduce the feelings of betrayal
during bad times. Some evidence consistent with our model is gathered from the Trump-Clinton 2016
election: on average, subjects primed with the importance of competence in policymaking decrease
their support for Trump, the candidate who scores lower on competence in our survey. But two groups
respond to the treatment with a large (between 5 and 7 percentage points) increase in their support
for Donald Trump: those living in rural areas and those that are low educated, white and living in urban
and suburban areas.

Introduction

It is not unusual for people disappointed with an election outcome to claim that it
was the result of “populist” tendencies.2 The precise meaning of populism varies, but
standard elements include nationalism, redistributive politics and emotional speeches. It also
sometimes includes a peculiar dimension: disdain for competence. One example appeared
during the 2016 US presidential election, where one of the candidates (Donald Trump) was
declared to be incompetent by several observers, who then went on to attribute Trump’s
popularity to voter ignorance.3 This poses a puzzle for those typically impressed with
individual rationality in other domains: why would voters sometimes choose the less
competent candidate?
The canonical model in economics of competence in policymaking demonstrates
that a less qualified candidate may receive the support of voters that are close to him/her on
an ideological dimension (see Besley and Coate, 1997). But, in that model, incompetence
reduces the appeal of a candidate whereas the appeal of populist leaders often appears to
increase with perceptions of incompetence. Indeed, Nichols (2017) explains “Americans
have reached a point where ignorance … is seen as an actual virtue”. Faced with this fact,
some have conjectured that incompetence may be seen as attractive because it is correlated
with courage.4 While this is an extremely interesting idea, the exact mechanism through
which voters in a democracy benefit from having (slightly blind) courageous leaders would
probably benefit from further clarification.
In this spirit, we provide a formal model in which voters demand incompetence for
well specified psychological reasons. Simultaneously, we provide empirical evidence
showing that audiences that seem susceptible to persuasion by populism appear to increase
their support for a relatively incompetent leader when they are primed to think about the
role of competence in politics. Thus, targets of populism seem to have a particular strong
aversion to voting for competent leaders.

The statement by Robert Tuttle, a former official in the Reagan and Bush administrations is typical: “The
Republican nominee for president has no government experience and has done nothing in his career to
demonstrate that he is competent to be president”. See Politico, October 8, 2016. See also, for example, Paul
Krugman in The New York Times, “Trump’s Delusions of Competence”, May 27, 2016, who concludes: “The
truth is that the idea that Donald Trump, of all people, knows how to run the U.S. economy is ludicrous. But
will voters ever recognize that truth?”. A striking feature of that election was that voters, and even many of
Trump’s own supporters, shared the “experts’” assessment: exit polls revealed that 20% of those answering
“No” to the question “Do you think Donald J. Trump has the temperament to serve effectively as president?”
declared to have voted for him (whereas in the case of Hillary Clinton this was true for only 5%). See for

We run a very short survey the week prior to the 2016 election. Half of the sample
was asked three questions about the importance of competence. By design, these are
ideologically neutral aspects of competence and most subjects agreed with the importance of
competence for the design and implementation of policy. Given the fact that there is little
monetary consequence to answering one way or the other, and the fact that the “treatment”
consists of simply reading something so short and non-controversial, we consider the
evidence gathered as “minimal”. Yet, the results are intriguing. Consistent with informal
news reports, our subjects regard Clinton as more competent than Trump. We do not find a
general result, confirming what pollsters and experts hypothesized before and after the
election.5 There is no average effect of the “minimal treatment” on vote intentions.
However, when we allow for effects that are specific to the sub-samples that have been
singled out as receptive to populist rhetoric, the average effect on the rest of the sample is
negative and significant in a regression explaining the support for Trump. This is consistent
with a “standard” channel, whereby subjects primed about the importance of competence
are less likely to vote for the candidate deemed less competent. In contrast, rural subjects
and subjects that are white, have low educational attainment (less than two years of college)
and live in urban and suburban areas react positively to the treatment.
We offer a simple model that can help interpret these findings. In a context where
corruption is a concern, voters must choose between two otherwise identical candidates who
differ in their competence for delivering material results to voters. The only departure from
standard preferences is the assumption that people who experience low income feel worse
when that is the outcome of an action of a politician who was previously trusted. This is
consistent with evidence gathered in the lab whereby people prefer to receive low income as
a result of luck rather than as a result of other people’s decisions (see, Bohnet and
Zeckhauser, 2004).
Our approach is consistent with historical accounts of populist events. For example,
in a celebrated essay Richard Hofstadter labels aspects of the populist style “paranoid”,
explaining the tight connection between politician incompetence and feelings of betrayal in
generating populist demands:
Any historian of warfare knows that it is in good part a comedy of errors and a museum of
incompetence; but if for every error and every act of incompetence one can substitute an act of treason,
we can see how many points of fascinating interpretation are open to the paranoid imagination:
treason in high places can be found at almost every turning –and in the end the real mystery, for one
who reads the primary works of paranoid scholarship, is not how the United States has been
brought to its present dangerous position, but how it has managed to survive at all.
Richard Hofstadter, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, Page 25
Our model is related to a large literature that has focused on the competence of
policy makers, starting with Rogoff’s study of fiscal policy distortions by politicians that want
to signal high ability (see Rogoff, 1990; see also Banks and Sundaram, 1993 and Alesina and
Rosenthal, 1995). Several papers have analyzed the ability of citizens entering politics as
candidates, starting with Besley and Coate (1997). Carrillo and Mariotti (2003) study
candidate selection by parties and show that parties can be excessively conservative, keeping
mediocre incumbents for too long instead of experimenting with newcomers of uncertain
5 See, “Multitude of Factors led to Republican’s Surprise Win”, The Wall Street Journal, November 10, 2016. This
is consistent with the evidence on the existence of a “culture war” (see Jacoby, 2014).

quality. A natural question concerns the causes of low quality politicians, including the role
of rewards from office in raising the quality of entering candidates (see, for example, Caselli
and Morelli, 2004, Messner and Polbern 2004; on the role of threats, see Dal Bo and Di
Tella, 2003).6 Egorov and Sonin (2011) present a model where a principal can have a
preference for a less competent agent in a setting where more competent agents observe less
noisy signals, but where this competence also leads agents to gain more from their capacity
to betray the principal.
Our paper’s focus on betrayal follows Bohnet, et al., (2004), who demonstrate in the
lab that there is less risk taking when the agent of uncertainty is nature than when it is
another person (see, also Bohnet, et al., 2008, for evidence on international differences as
well as Bolton and Ockenfelds, 2010). This is also a theme in previous research in
psychology. For example, Koehler and Gershoff (2003) find that people react more
negatively to a bad action when it involves a violation of a duty (or promise). They find that,
when choosing safety products, people prefer inferior options (in terms of risk exposure) to
options that included an extremely small risk of betrayal but that choices were reversed when
the betrayal risk was replaced by an equivalent risk not associated to betrayal. Finally,
research in cognition has found that an experimental manipulation that is known to increase
analytic processing reduces belief in conspiracy theories (see, Swami, et al, 2014). Obviously,
work on betrayal is connected to the large literature on trust, (see for example, Knack and
Keefer 1995; La Porta, et al. 1997; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2004; Aghion, et al. 2010).
Naturally, there is a lot of prior work on populism as an ideology, a strategy or a
political style, in sociology, history and political science (for a recent review, see Gidron and
Bonikowski, 2013). In economics, one strand of work emphasizes the role of social conflict
and inequality (for an example with short-sighted voters, see Sachs, 1989). While it is
tempting to call “populist” any policy that reduces growth, policies that maximize growth are
only likely to be optimal for governments that care exclusively about “capitalists” (see, for
example, Alesina and Rodrik, 1994). Another perspective, emerging partly from work
describing macroeconomic populism, views it as including non-sustainable policies and
beliefs about key elasticities that economists tend to view as implausible (see, for example,
descriptions of the Peruvian experience in Dornbusch and Edwards, 1991). Acemoglu,
Egorov and Sonin (2013) develop a model where politicians distort policies to signal to
voters that they are not in the pockets of the elite. Politicians choose policies to the left of
what the median voter prefers, which is interpreted as a form of populism.7 Similarly, Di
Tella and MacCulloch (2009) study capture by the elite but focus on voters’ evaluations of
fairness in a model where left wing policies are the only way voters can punish corrupt
capitalists.
One limitation of these papers is that they interpret populism as equivalent to
interventionism (or being on the left), so they are unable to explain right wing populism,

Several studies study candidate quality using education and pre-office income as indicators of competence
(see, for example, Dal Bo, Dal Bo, and Snyder 2009; Besley and Reynal-Querol 2011; Galasso and Nannicini,
2011). Alt, et al. (2011) find that the performance of incumbent US governors, as measured by economic
growth and policies such as taxes, improves with tenure, controlling for term limits.

For an example where most voters may dislike democratic outcomes, see Bates and La Ferrara (2001).

which is also quite common.8 In contrast, Acemoglu, Robinson and Torvik, (2013) provide a
model where populism is interpreted as anti institutionalism: checks and balances may not be
useful because they may reduce the rents of the executive, making it cheaper for the elite to
bribe. Contempt for institutions, and our paper’s focus on disdain for competence, are
consistent with the large literature outside of economics exploring the ways in which
populism does not fit standard a left-right split.9
In the next section we present a simple model that connects betrayal aversion,
perceptions of corruption and competence in decision-making. Section III describes
elements of the 2016 Presidential election in the US, emphasizing themes present in our
model. Section IV describes the results from a short survey we run the week prior to this
election. Section V concludes.

II.

A Simple Model of Paranoid Voters

To explore the demand for incompetence, we start by capturing in a simple manner the idea
that competent decision makers (DMs) have a higher likelihood of improving outcomes for
voters at no cost to themselves. They do so by solving technical problems appropriately. In
a more elaborate model, what these competent policymakers are able to do is to institute
Pareto improving policies whose well-chosen transfers succeed in making everyone better
off. Here, we simplify the analysis by letting all voters benefit equally. While not identical,
this is similar to previous treatments of competence (e.g., in Rogoff, 1990, and in Besley and
Coate, 1997) where it allows politicians to institute a wider range of policies.
We first provide some broad intuition for the model’s key parameters and for its main
mechanism of action. Afterwards, we present an asymmetric information model in which
the space of contracts that DMs can write with voters is limited. In the equilibrium of this
game, there are parameters for which the demand for incompetence is very strong.
The model contains two groups of agents, voters and potential decision makers. Individuals
belong either to one group or the other and all voters have identical tastes. There are two
periods. In the first, one voter chosen at random chooses one of the potential DMs to
become leader. Leaders are in office only in period 2. Between period 1 and 2, they obtain
some information and in period 2 they are able to make one decision. Crucially, this
information is acquired only by the elected leader and not by any other members of the
group of potential DMs.
We now consider a relatively informal intuitive analysis. Competent DMs have a probability
p of coming up with a solution to a problem that voters did not necessarily regard as
solvable. In other words, DMs acquisition of public office makes it possible for them to
identify solutions to problems that voters face. DM’s with a competence level k , have a
8 It is hard to quantify these two strands of populism, but Google scholar reports a very similar number of
entries for left wing populism and right wing populism. See, for example, Norris (2005) and Williamson, et al.,
(2011). One extension in Acemoglu, Egorov and Sonin (2013) discusses right-wing populism as a result of
influential lobbies on the left.

For a cross regional perspective on these and other aspects of populism, see Mudde and Kaltwasser (2012).
For a discussion of how extra-electoral populist practices (such as tribunals and public accusations) can help
control the elites in Machiavelli’s theory of democracy, see McCormick (2001). For a discussion of
“ethnopopulism”, see Madrid (2008).

probability pk of doing so. If a DM solves a problem that voters had, voters’ material
payoffs rise to H. This exceeds the material payoffs L that voters experience if none of their
problems are solved. Thus, voters prefer DMs with higher values of k if everything else is
equal.
The competence of DM’s is not the only determinant of whether DMs help the people who
put them in office. Of similar order of importance is whether DM’s prefer to help voters or
prefer helping their personal friends (who, rather than being voters, belong to the group of
potential DMs). In the extremely simplified setup we develop, there is a perennial conflict
between the two: a DM has the opportunity to help her friends substantially only if she also
has the ability to raise the material payoff of her voters to H . Moreover, the leader cannot
help both voters and friends at the same time. It is only when the DM is lucky/competent
enough to be able to solve a substantial problem faced by her voters that she has an
opportunity to help her friends. If she does the latter, the voters get material payoffs of L,
just as if the DM had not solved a voter problem in the first place.
Voters thus care a great deal about the probability, which we denote by q, that DMs will
choose to help their friends when they could have helped voters instead. If DMs always
prefer helping their friends to raising the material payoffs of voters, q equals the probability
that the DM knows the nature of the action that helps her friends when she figures out an
action that helps voters. Alternatively, one can suppose that a DM always knows the nature
of the action that would benefit her friend (and leave voters with material benefits of L)
whenever she knows how to increase the material payoffs of her voters to H . In this case,
the probability q is simply equal to the probability that the DM prefers to help her friends
rather than the people who voted for her.10
Regardless of the interpretation we give q, the expected material payoffs obtained by a voter
from a DM are equal to
𝐿 + 𝑝𝑘 1 − 𝑞 𝐻 − 𝐿 .
We let all potential DMs have the same p and q , so they differ only in their k ‘s. Some
potential DMs are available whose k equals zero. One advantage of fixing q is that it ensures
that competence k is not mechanically related to the DM’s corruptibility. Voters interested in
material payoffs can then all be expected to hope for the same election outcome, namely that
a DM with the highest k gets elected. This means that the voter who is chosen at random
to cast the decisive ballot chooses a DM with the highest available k.
This result hinges crucially on the assumption that voters care only about their material
payoffs. However, political discourse is often marked by emotionally charged terms that fit
poorly with the idea that voters have such narrow preferences. For example, it seems
common for people to complain that politicians have “betrayed” them.11 The intuitive

The parameter q picks up a particularly pernicious form of corruptibility in the sense that the reduction in
material payoffs that is due to q is not directly observable (since people still get L). What we show is that this
particular form of corruptibility has a very direct effect on the desirability of DM's with different k's.

model we have been discussing has a natural moment in which it would be logical for voters
to feel betrayed.
Suppose in particular, that voters knew that the DM who had been voted into office had an
opportunity to increase the voters’ material payoff to H , and that voters also knew (as a
result of an investigation, say) that the DM chose to help her friends instead. Particularly if q
is interpreted as the probability that the DM will find herself preferring to help her friends
rather than help those that put her into office, it seems reasonable for voters, at this point, to
have a purely emotional loss in utility that is unrelated to the magnitude of the loss in
material payoffs.
This is very much the perspective of Rotemberg (2008), where people have a
minimal altruism that they expect others to have towards them, and react with anger when
the evidence suggests that people are not acting with an altruism level that exceeds this
minimum. The evidence that people react with anger to observable acts that do not “look”
altruistic is quite extensive including, for example, evidence from “road rage.”12 Indeed,
people do not just care about outcomes, but they also care about how these outcomes came
to be (see Rabin, 1993). In a clean demonstration of this effect Bohnet and Zeckhauser
(2004) compare the decision to trust a stranger in a one-shot interaction with taking a risky
bet, and find that trusting requires an additional risk premium to balance the costs of
betrayal (see also Eckel and Wilson, 2004; Fehr, Urs Fischbacher, and Michael Kosfeld
2005).13 Bohnet et al (2008) finds very similar levels of betrayal aversion in comparable
experiments in Brazil, China, Oman, Switzerland, and Turkey. Bohnet, et al (2010) study the
role of different expectations of trust in different countries as an explanation for differences
in willingness to pay to avoid trusting. Subjects in Arab countries demanded a substantially
higher minimum trustworthiness threshold before trusting than did American and Swiss
subjects, well above the probability thresholds required to take risk in an analogous game
where Nature determined the outcome. Cross regional differences in willingness to trust
mainly came from differences in people's intolerance of betrayal (see Ashraf, et al. 2006 for a
comparison of reciprocity versus unconditional kindness in the determination of trust and
trustworthiness; on expectations of trust see also Butler, Giuliano and Guiso, 2015, 2016).
In the simplest case of this model, voters cannot be expected to ever know whether they
have been betrayed by DM’s. In the case where they have been betrayed, their material
payoffs equal L, the same as if the DM simply did not know the solution to any of their
problems. Still, they cannot help but to put some weight on the possibility that they will be
betrayed at some point, since they know that some of the outcomes in which their material
payoffs will equal L, will be the result of a DM choosing to favor her friends.
The resulting loss in utility is easiest to calculate if voters care about their expected utility
EU, and this is computed by multiplying the probability of all three different outcomes
12

See Rotemberg (2014) for additional references.

Apparently, there is a biological basis for this type of trust: Kosfeld et al. (2005) give subjects a neuronal
signal molecule that promote social behavior in animals and observe that they are more likely to accept the risk
of betrayal, but does not change their evaluation of gambles involving random risk. Whitson and Galinsky
(2008) conduct experiments demonstrating that uncertainty is connected to the perception of patterns in what
is essentially a random outcome (including conspiracies). Conspiratorial beliefs have also been linked to being a
member of a disadvantaged group (Abalkina-Paap et al., 1999 and Goertzel, 1994), and associated with the
rejection of scientific findings (e.g., Lewandowsky, et al, 2013).

(voters get H, voters get L as a result of the DM not identifying the opportunity for
improving material outcomes, and voters get L as a result of being betrayed by the DM)
times the utility of voters if they knew that they were in each of these three states. Suppose
further that utility is simply equal to material payoffs in the first two of these states, while it
equals L-B, in the third. The parameter B thus captures the direct psychological loss of
betrayal, and the use of this expected utility function implies that utility is linearly declining
in the probability of this betrayal.
In the current model, the probability of betrayal is simply pkq . This implies that expected
utility equals
𝐸𝑈 = 𝐿 + 𝑝𝑘 1 − 𝑞 (𝐻 − 𝐿) − 𝑝𝑘𝑞𝐵
It follows that voters’ EU is strictly decreasing in k if the following condition is satisfied.
𝐵
1−𝑞
>
𝑞
𝐻−𝐿

(1)

Thus, for sufficiently large values of B and q , voters strictly prefer more incompetent leaders
to more competent ones. The intuition for this result is that, once B and q are high enough,
the main effect of raising k on EU is to increase the subjective cost of betrayal, either
because q is high enough that people mostly expect betrayal or because the subjective cost
of betrayal B is high enough.
The result can be thought of as a political application of the theory of the second best (see,
Lancaster and Lipsey, 1956): once leaders are not necessarily honest, it may be worth hiring
those that are incompetent. Indeed, the abundance of traitors/corrupt leaders moves voters
in the direction of electing incompetent leaders. To see this, notice that in the limit where q
equals one, the voter never receives the material payoff H because he is always betrayed. As
a result, he always prefers to make k as low as possible. In particular,
𝜕𝐸𝑈
= −𝑝𝑞𝐵
!→! 𝜕𝑘
This intuitive analysis suggests that outcomes of the political process could be quite
inefficient. In particular, the potential gains from having DMs that have access to
information on how to help voters would be entirely dissipated if the equilibrium DM had a
k=0. Moreover, in this case, the DM’s friends do not benefit from the DM’s knowledge
either.
lim

This raises the question of whether superior outcomes are possible. We now provide a
game-theoretic structure based on asymmetric information and incomplete contracts that
ensures that this outcome in which all information acquired by the DM is wasted is the only
equilibrium.
We suppose that the elected leader learns the values of two signals s and w. Before these
signals are realized, their ex ante distribution is uniform between zero and one. If s ≤kp , the
DM also learns that, if she takes the specific action b(s) in the second period (again at no cost
to herself), the payoffs to voters equal H. Any other action, or any action when the
realization of s exceeds kp , ensures that voters receive a material payoff of L .14
14 It might be objected that, when k<1, a DM with p>s>kp could still take decisions “at random,” and thereby
occasionally set b equal to b(s) , with the result that her voters obtain H . We have in mind a sufficiently large

8

Notice that realizations of s smaller than or equal to kp represent potentially good news for
society because they imply that material payoffs of all voters can be increased. The
realization of w , on the other hand, governs whether leaders will wish to help voters in this
way. If w≥q , the DM prefers to take action b(s) over any other action. He thus wishes to
help voters. If instead, w≤q , the DM prefers an action that differs from b(s) , and which
raises the payoffs of some of the leaders’ friends. By assumption, all friends of leaders are
members of the group of potential DMs. As in the previous informal analysis, leaders who
can be expected to betray voters in this way with probability µ, cause voters a direct expected
psychological cost of µB.
We suppose not only that no one except the leader directly observes either s or w , but also
that leaders do not have a mechanism for directly revealing either of these signals.
Therefore, there exists no feasible contract in which payments from voters to DMs depend
on the realization of these signals. We make the same assumption regarding the material
payoffs of voters, H and L . DMs and voters are, in particular, unable to write contracts that
make payments between these agents depend on the realized values of voters’ material
payoffs.15
If one accepts these limitations on feasible contracts, the only possible outcome in period 2
is for the DM to choose b(s) when s ≤kp and w>q. She chooses an action that favors her
friends instead if s ≤kp and w<q. The reason this is the only feasible allocation is that it is the
one the DM favors and there is no scheme that allows voters to provide incentives to
deviate from this allocation.
Notice that we have been quite vague concerning the feasibility of contracts between DMs
and their friends. Empirically this reflects the lack of transparency that is one of the defining
characteristics of these contracts. Theoretically, it turns out that the existence and breadth
of allowable contracts of this type is reflected in the parameter q already. If DMs are likely to
help their friends because bribe arrangements are easy to enforce by informal means, this
raises q in exactly the same way as high altruism of leaders for their friends.
We now come to the first period. We demonstrate that, if condition (1) above is satisfied,
the unique equilibrium wastes all information acquired by the DM. In other words, the
resulting allocation is the same as if p were equal to zero for the elected DM. To see this,
consider the voter that has been randomly selected to cast the decisive vote. This voter’s
EU is strictly decreasing in k , so he chooses a DM with k=0 . As a result, the material
payoffs of voters equal L every period and the DM never takes an action that benefits her
friends. The outcome is indeed the same as if p=0 .
A final intuition for why paranoia can triumph in this case is that the probability of betrayal
µ is equal to pkq with the total expected cost of betrayal being equal to µB. This betrayal cost
pushes towards a low k , since a low k reduces the capacity of the DM to betray the voter.

action space that this can be ignored. A stronger version of this result can presumably be obtained by
supposing that DMs with k<1 are such bad decision makers that they are less likely than a purely random
decision generator to come up with b(s).
In practice, the press seems to spend little time discussing such contracts, suggesting that they may indeed be
uncommon.

15

9

The countervailing benefit of a higher k, is that the voter gets H-L with probability pk(1-q).
Because the resulting expected gains depend somewhat differently on the parameters, it is
straightforward to find conditions under which paranoia wins.16

III.

The 2016 American Election

The 2016 US election is a reasonable setting to study these questions, in part because one of
the two candidates, Donald Trump, was consistently described as “populist”, in what was an
extremely partisan election.17,18 It also involved several of the features emphasized above.
Competence: The two candidates were separated by the perception of a competence gap,
favoring the least populist candidate (Hillary Clinton). There were many discussions in the
media covering different dimensions of competence, including ability, temperament and
experience. To some, this was part of a broader rejection of science by populists in the US
and abroad.19 Many viewed it as one of the defining features of the election:
“The paramount question is whether a person exhibiting no qualification for the
office –neither experience, nor preparation, nor personal character- is nonetheless to
become president.” Benjamin Friedman “On the Election III”, New York Review of
Books, November 10, 2016.20
Corruption: Trump’s campaign focused on accusations of corruption against his rival, whom
he named “crooked Hillary”. In his speeches, he provided details. For example, in his speech
of June 22, 2016 in New York City, he expanded
While our model emphasizes psychological features of voters in the demand for incompetence it would be
useful to understand if similar psychological features might explain the demand by a principal for incompetent
agents (see Egorov and Sonin, 2011).

On many measures, it was more polarized than ever before: in the 2016 presidential election over 1,700
counties the winner took the county by 20 percentage points or more (more votes were cast in these counties
than in closely contested counties). In 2012 it was fewer than 1,100, while in 1988 it was fewer than 200. The
Wall Street Journal, November 10, 2016. Polarization (and income inequality) have been linked to support for
Trump (and Brexit) and, in historical studies, to electoral fraud (see, for example Ziblatt, 2009).

17

Charges of populism were levied against Hillary Clinton as well, but Trump was the overwhelming target of
these accusations. See, for example, “Donald Trump, The Perfect Populist”, Politico Magazine, March 9, 2016.
Part of the difficulty, of course, is the paradox of a billionaire acting as an “outsider” (perhaps because this gave
him some freedom to act “unscripted”).

Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez claimed Simon Bolivar had been assassinated dismissing scientists' conclusions
that the liberation hero died of TB. He explained "The Venezuelan bourgeoisie continue to say that we are
trying to change history. No. They changed it," in “Hugo Chávez claims Simon Bolívar was murdered not
backed by science”, The Guardian, 26 July, 2011. On Trump and climate change, see “Echoes of Galileo in the
Populist Retreat from Reason”, The Financial Times, December 7, 2016. Apparently, he explained “The concept
of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”
20 See, also, Elizabeth Drew’s entry in the same symposium: “Historians are going to have a hard time with this
election. How to comprehend that someone manifestly unfit for the presidency won the nomination of one of
the two major political parties and for some of the time was supported by almost as many of the voters as his
opponent?”. See, also, Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post, “The GOP is picking an incompetent candidate”,
July 18, 2016. There were also many reports of Clinton’s competence. One example is The Washington Post’s
endorsement of October 13, 2016, where she is described as “smart”.

“She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for
oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash. Then, when she left, she
made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests –
in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.
Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and
foreign governments in the years since 2001. They totally own her, and that will
never change.”
While Trump also faced accusations of self-dealing, Clinton was perhaps more vulnerable to
corruption accusations because she had been in government for a long period of time.
Indeed, the central theme of Trump’s campaign was that the whole political system was
rigged.21 This campaign was so successful that Trump soon claimed he was the first to use
the word.22 By all accounts, these efforts were effective in framing the electoral choice for
voters.23
Trump’s status as a business tycoon with many interests abroad made him an unlikely leader
to fight big business and foreign interests. Yet, he included specific proposals that appeared
to contradict this perception. For example, he pledged to “renegotiate NAFTA” and dump
the Trans Pacific Partnership (“it is a horrible deal”). And, on the same day AT&T’s CEO
announced “an $85 billion merger … ‘that would turn the giant telephone company into one
of the world’s biggest media companies by swallowing Time Warner Inc.’ Donald Trump
told supporters in Gettysburg Pa., he would block the deal if elected. “Its too much
concentration of power in the hands of too few” he said, calling the merger “an example of
the power structure I am fighting.” The company has one of the largest lobbying operations
in Washington –spending $16 million last year.”24
Coherence: Finally, our model suggests populism is a coherent story connecting actions to
outcomes rather than an instinctive emotional reaction without much order.25 Part of the
Apparently this was the advice of Roger Stone: “In a 13-page memo to Trump, Stone urged him to state that
“the system is rigged against the citizens” and that he is the lone candidate “who cannot be bought.” See
“Donald Trump struggles to turn political fling into a durable campaign”, The Washington Post, August 9, 2015.

An article in FactCheck.org concluded “Our review of public statements suggests Trump borrowed the word
from Sanders, who regularly has used the term “rigged” to describe the government systems that
institutionalize income inequality. That has been a Sanders theme since day one of his campaign — long before
Trump made the word a regular staple of his stump speeches. In fact, populist politicians have been using the
term “rigged” for decades to describe various government or political systems – despite Trump’s claim that a
couple “political pros” told him that he was a trailblazer in using the word “rigged.” Robert Farley, “Trump’s
‘Rigged’ Claim”, in The Wire, July 12, 2016

After the election a standard conclusions was that her campaign was “dogged by scandal over her use of a
private email server, paid speeches to Wall Street and accusations that she used the state department for a ‘pay
to play’ scheme related to the charitable Clinton Foundation”. See “Outsider has last laugh by tapping into
voter disdain”, in The Financial Times, November 10, 2016.

24 See “Donald Trump vs. AT&T: A Signal Test of How Business Will Fare in New Washington”, The Wall
Street Journal, November 16, 2016.

As one observer summarized it: “Most of the commentary about Trump has treated him as if he is a one-off,
as someone who has emerged because of the peculiar coincidence of his larger-than-life self-absorption and the
advent of social media platforms that encourage it. But the Trump-as-one-off argument begins to fall apart
when we think about what else happened in politics this year. First of all, Trump is not alone. If he alone had

Trump campaign focused on providing an interpretation of recent economic woes in
America based on the existence of corruption. In the New York speech of June 22, 2016,
Trump focused on Clinton’s personal corruption (see above) and explained
“Because it’s not just the political system that’s rigged. It’s the whole economy. It’s
rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages. It’s rigged by big businesses
who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the
U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them. It’s rigged by bureaucrats who are
trapping kids in failing schools. It’s rigged against you, the American people.”
If anything, Trump’s interpretation (and our approach), where betrayal has such a large
effect on outcomes, provides too much order. Hofstadter pointed out the paradox:
“It is nothing if not coherent –in fact, the paranoid mentality is far more coherent than the real
world, since it leaves no room for mistakes, failures, or ambiguities. It is, if not wholly rational, at
least intensely rationalistic; it believes that it is up against an enemy who is as infallibly rational as
he is totally evil, and it seeks to match his imputed total competence with its own, leaving nothing
unexplained and comprehending all of reality in one overreaching, consistent theory.”
Richard Hofstadter, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, Page 37

Minimal Evidence on Demand for Incompetence

IV.i. Survey design
Our data was collected through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, an internet-based market for
tasks. It opened on October 27, 2016 and was closed on November 3 (the election was on
November 8, 2016). M-Turk was used to attract subjects by offering a small reward (1 dollar)
for taking a brief survey (“The survey should take you less than 10 minutes”) to “help us
learn more about the relationship between politics, government and policy design in the
context of the current election”. When subjects started the survey they read a similar
description including the information about us (“You are being asked to take part in a survey
being done by a group of researchers from Harvard University”), and explaining that
participation was voluntary and anonymous. We restricted the survey to subjects that had
prior HIT approval greater than 80% (i.e., subjects that at least 80% of their previous tasks
had been approved by their “employers”), and who lived in states where Trump was doing
relatively well in the polls.26

emerged—if there were no Bernie Sanders, no Brexit, no crisis in the EU—it would be justifiable to pay
attention only to his peculiarities and to the oddities of the moment. But with these other uprisings occurring
this year, it’s harder to dismiss Trump as a historical quirk.” See, Joshua Mitchell, “Donald Trump Does Have
Ideas -and We’d Better Pay Attention to Them”, Politico Magazine, September 15, 2016.
These include Texas, Florida, Missouri, Indiana, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Kentucky, West Virginia and Alaska.

26

The flow of the survey is simple: we first ask three basic questions (gender, age and a
standard question on trust). We then administer the treatment (described below) to the
treatment group. Then both groups are asked the key outcome variable (regarding their
voting intentions). The rest of the survey follows.
Our “minimal” treatment is designed to prime subjects with the importance of competence
in politics. It has three parts, each focused on different aspects of competence. The first part
asserts that policy problems are difficult and “demonstrates” that ideology is not useful, by
presenting two cases where the “best course of action” involved solutions that are on
opposite sides of the ideological spectrum. It asks subjects the extent to which they agree on
a 0-10 scale with the following statements:
Nowadays problems in economic policy can be so complex that few people in government fully
understand them. Sometimes, for example, the best course of action is to reduce regulations (as was
the case with the entry of low-cost airlines), while at other times it would have been good to increase
regulations (as was the case with financial products before the crisis).

The second question emphasizes the technical demands of some policy problems and how
that allows politicians not to be captured by lobbies. It also asserts that good universities are
a source of this “technical knowledge”. It reads:
Politicians that understand technical matters can evaluate policies better and engage in a productive
dialogue with industry and private interests. A good education, for example at a top university, is one
of the ways a politician can gain such technical knowledge.

The third and final part of our “minimal treatment” includes relevant, practical experience as
a source of knowledge. It reads:
Politicians can also improve their ability to find solutions to complex problems through practical
experience, either work related or through participation in corporate boards.

Data emerging from such a simple survey have obvious limitations. On the other hand,
some advantages (see Horton, Rand, and Zeckhauser 2011) have recently led several
researchers to rely on this method for gathering data (see, for example, Kuziemko et al.
2015, Weinzierl 2014 and Saez and Stantcheva 2016). Several papers have studied the
characteristics of M-Turk respondents and their usefulness for political research (see,
Berinsky, et al., 2012, 2014 ; Mason and Suri 2012, and Huff and Tingley 2015).
The evidence we provide should be considered “minimal”, for at least two reasons. First, the
data we gather is from a short survey, administered on Amazon’s M-Turk, where subjects
give answers without much consequence.27 Second, the “treatment” that provides a source
of independent variation consists in reading a very short passage (disguised as three
questions) that is designed to prime subjects towards the idea that competence is helpful in
politics.

As in most surveys of this type, payment is conditional on the task being approved, but subjects have an
expectation that this will happen (and they are correct in this case).

27

13

IV.ii. Data
The survey was taken by 4,078 subjects. We collected data on the time spent by subjects on
each of the windows that were presented during the survey. We note that several subjects
took less time than the minimum amount of time required for reading the questions (for
example, two subjects took 14 seconds). To get potentially meaningful answers we consider
only individuals that took at least 90 seconds to complete the survey (not considering the
time spent in the treatment window). Second, among these individuals we consider only
those who spent at least 3 seconds looking at the treatment window (this last condition
doesn’t apply to individuals assigned to the control group). We also introduce three other
restrictions: we do not consider subjects that are under age, those answering that they will
not vote and those that answer the third option (“I prefer to provide my own answer”) in
the gender question (question number 1).28 After eliminating two other subjects who
declared living outside the US, the total number of observations is 3,532.
Table A presents the data summarized across treatments. It shows that, at least with respect
to observables, the data are balanced across treatments, suggesting a successful
randomization.

IV. iii. Basic Characteristics of the Two Candidates
Of course, people’s average opinions can differ from the anecdotal evidence offered as
context in section III.29 Thus, it is important to study the basic characteristics of the two
candidates in our sample.
Competence: Table B presents evidence from four different questions using data from the
untreated sub-sample. Column (1) reports the results using the question
In the current US election, Hillary Clinton stands out for her work ethic and for her attention to detail. She
has a law degree from an elite institution (Yale University), she has launched many social initiatives since
entering politics (such as the Arkansas Advocates Children and Families) and she has learned how real
business works (for example, by serving on several corporate boards).
One advocate explained: “Even Hillary Clinton’s sharpest critics will concede that she is exceptionally
well-informed. Unusually for a presidential candidate, she’s spent a lot of time in what were in effect staff
jobs rather than principal jobs — roles in which knowing what she’s talking about was a key part of the
position.”
Do you agree with this?

Almost 28% of the sample chooses numbers suggesting they disagree (below 5), whereas
67% choose numbers above 5.
The minimum number of seconds for which the frequency of subjects is 10 or more is 84. Results are robust
to other sample definitions, including using only subjects that took more than 120 seconds (the main change is
weaker results in Table 1). They are also robust to excluding a small group of subjects that took 4 standard
deviations more than the mean. In our sample of 3,532 subjects, the mean number of seconds spent answering
the survey is 230 (std. deviation=240).

28

Many have struggled to explain the origin of Trump’s appeal. “Asked to choose one reason for their vote for
Mr. Trump, none comes up with the same one.” See “Diverse voices share yearnings for change”, The Financial
Times, Thursday November 10, 2016.

29

14

The next three columns use questions where subjects have to decide if a particular
description better fits Trump or Clinton. Column (2) reveals that 40% of subjects report
Trump is more “elitist, out of touch” than Clinton, whereas only 26% think this description is
more applicable to Clinton. There are basically no differences in terms of how “popular, in
synch with most Americans” both candidates are. There are large differences in the third
category: 65% of subjects report that the phrase “Understands details of policies and how to
implement them” applies more to Clinton than to Trump, whereas only 12% report the
opposite. Overall, these results suggest that Clinton is clearly seen as more “competent” than
Trump in our sample of untreated subjects.
Since this last question asks for a direct comparison between Clinton and Trump on the
competence dimension it is interesting to note that in this (untreated) sample, 27.3% of
those that will vote Trump or are leaning Trump, say that “Understands details of policies
and how to implement them” applies more to Clinton than to Trump. A very similar
number (30.4%) say that it applies more to Trump. Thus, 72.7% of the Trump supporters
do not choose Trump on this score. In contrast, within Clinton supporters, 93.6% say that it
applies more to Clinton than to Trump, while only 1.4% say it applies more to Trump than
to Clinton.
Corruption: Table C focuses on perceptions of corruption, again using only the part of the
sample that was not treated. It shows that subjects declaring they will vote for Trump also
think there is more corruption in the country. The exact question is

“How much corruption do you think there is in US politics? For example, if you take 10 politicians,
how many do you think are corrupt?” Answers are on a slide, with 0 out o10 on the left-end and
10/10 on the right-end.

The difference is large: Trump voters think that 7.80 out of 10 politicians in the US are
corrupt while Clinton voters only think there are only 6.37. Interestingly, perceptions of
corruption increase (monotonically) as the intensity of preference for Trump goes up.
Subjects that don’t know who they will vote, or are not going to vote, perceive corruption to
be most widespread. We note that rural voters see more corruption than non-rural voters
and that the same is true for low-education-white subjects living outside of rural areas
(although the differences are not large).
We also include in Table C the answers to a question on the importance of being near
people that keep their word. When we combine the Vote Trump and Leaning Trump
categories (and the same for Clinton), there is evidence that Trump supporters regard
keeping one’s word a more important characteristic than Clinton supporters, but the
evidence is not as strong as in the case of corruption.
IV. iv. Main Regression Results
To the extent that the treatment primes subjects about the importance of competence in
politics, the treatment might be expected to increase the support for Clinton, who is seen as
especially competent. This can be termed the “standard channel”: if we have a candidate that
is seen to excel in one attribute and success becomes more tied to this attribute, one would

15

expect the attractiveness of that candidate to increase. Thus, a simple empirical test is to see
if the treatment increases the support for Clinton. Our model suggests instead that, in a
context where corruption is important, treated subjects might want to increase their demand
for the less competent candidate (Trump). We note that there is also an alternative reason –
not covered by our model- why they might increase their support for the less competent
candidate: subjects may simply disagree that something called competence exists and treat it
as a partisan construct (we consider this possibility below).
Table 1 presents our results using as the dependent variable Trump, a dummy equal to 1 if
the subject will vote for or is leaning towards Trump, and zero otherwise. We note that just
over 37% of our sample will vote/lean Trump, 49% vote/lean Clinton while a little over
13% don’t know. Column (1) reports the results of regressing Trump on our treatment
showing an insignificant effect. In the rest of the paper we focus on specific groups that
have been indicated as particularly susceptible to populist tendencies. Although support for
Trump proved difficult to predict,30 those living in rural areas, and those with low
educational attainment living in the cities were considered his main voter base.31 Accordingly
we pay particular attention to these two groups.
Column (2) adds Urban, a dummy equal to 1 if the subject described him/herself as
“someone living in an urban area”, as well as an interaction between this dummy and the
treatment. Just over 27% of the sample (969 subjects) describe themselves as urban. The
marginal effect on urban is negative and comfortably significant, but the interaction is
insignificant. Column (3) repeats the exercise with people living in suburban areas (just over
48% of the sample). The direct effects are insignificant but the interaction term is negative.
Although this effect is marginally significant (at the 5.2% level), it shows that suburban
subjects that are primed about the difficulty of policymaking are less likely to vote for Trump,
who is seen as the less qualified of the two candidates. This is consistent with what might be
termed the “standard channel”.
Column (4) includes the treatment and Rural, a dummy equal to 1 if the subject described
him/herself as a “someone living in a rural area”, and an interaction between Rural and
Treatment. Over 24% of the sample identifies as Rural (859 out of 3,532 subjects). The
marginal effect on Rural is positive and comfortably significant, confirming the view that
Trump was more popular in rural areas (48% vs 32%, a gap in excess of 15 percentage
points). The basic treatment effect is insignificant again (and negative) but interestingly, the
treatment makes rural people more likely to say that they will vote Trump or that are leaning
that way. The effect is only significant at the 7% level, but it is sizeable: rural people that
were treated are approximately 6 percentage points more likely to vote/lean Trump than
untreated ones.32 Considering the “minimal” nature of the treatment and its neutral tone, the
A typical description of Trump’s voters is “A cross section of white America, educated and less so, affluent
and less so, they do not fit into neat categories -apart from being overwhelmingly white.” In “Diverse voices
share yearnings for change”, Financial Times, Thursday November 10, 2016.

30

See Greg Mankiw, “The Triumph of the Less Educated”, Saturday, November 12, 2016, or Paul Krugman,
“Our Unknown Country”, The New York Times, November 9, 2016. He states “There turn out to be a huge
number of people — white people, living mainly in rural areas — who don’t share at all our idea of what
America is about. For them, it is about blood and soil, about traditional patriarchy and racial hierarchy.”

31

Similar results obtain when we restrict the sample to subjects that spent at least two minutes taking the
survey (instead of just 90 seconds). The size of the sample drops somewhat but, if anything, there is a very

32

16

size of the effect is very large. Column (5) includes the two interactions (with Urban and
Rural) with similar results.
Table 2 studies the role of education and race. Column (1) includes the treatment, an
indication for low education and their interaction. Low education is taken to mean less than
a 2-year college degree and there are 1,369 subjects reporting low education (almost 39% of
the sample). The three marginal effects are insignificant. The interaction between the
treatment and low education is only significant at the 6%, with a point estimate implying a
sizeable effect.
To incorporate the racial element in Trump’s support we can create a more restrictive
category: those with low education and identifying themselves as White. The dummy Low
Education, White is equal to 1 for 1,115 subjects. The results from column (2) suggest that
this group is 9 percentage points more likely to support Trump. Again, those in this group
that are “treated” are 6 percentage points more likely to support Trump, although this is
significant only at the 10% level.
Column (3) is particularly interesting. It studies this effect outside of a rural setting
(restricting the sample to urban and suburban residents). At 32%, the base probability of
voting/leaning Trump is lower in these areas. Within the smaller sample (of 2,563 non rural
subjects), 707 (or 27%) are identified as both Low Education and White. The direct
treatment effect is now negative and significant, suggesting that support for Trump on
average falls when subjects are primed with the importance of competence in policy making.
This is the “standard channel” now significant for the sample under consideration: priming
on the importance of competence makes the competent candidate more attractive. In
contrast, and consistent with our model, the coefficient on the interaction between the
treatment and the dummy for Low education-White is positive and significant. The effect is
quantitatively large: whites with less than 2 years of college that are treated are almost 7
percentage points more likely to vote for Trump than those that are not treated.
Column (4) considers the full sample and includes indicators for the treatment and for both
groups of interest: rural subjects on the one hand and whites living in urban and suburban
areas that have low educational attainment. It shows that both groups increase their support
for Trump when they are treated. The implied size of the estimated coefficients is quite
large. Treated subjects in the base category (urban and suburban non-whites and whites with
high education) were more than 5 percentage points less likely to vote for Trump than
untreated subjects in the same group. In contrast, treated rural subjects were 5 percentage
points more likely to vote for Trump than untreated rural subjects. Finally, urban and
suburban low education whites that were treated were 7 percentage points more likely to vote
for Trump relative to subjects in that same group but untreated.33

small increase in the point estimate of the effects of interest suggesting that our results are robust to eliminating
from our sample the “fastest” subjects.
It is important to stress that our finding is very different in kind than the classic polarization finding of Lord,
Ross and Lepper (1979) that reading texts can lead people with different opinions to “polarize” their opinions
so that they are even more different after reading an identical text. The findings might be seen as related
because a) our treatment consists of reading some text and b) the group that predominantly supports Trump
increases its support for him and the same is true to some extent for the suburban group that supports
Clinton. The key difference, though, is that we are not measuring the extent to which individuals who supported
a particular candidate now support him more strongly. Rather, we are seeing individuals change the candidate they
33

17

What this shows is that it was an electoral mistake to emphasize Clinton’s technical
proficiency over Trump to motivate these groups of voters (as some of her supporters did;
see footnote 1). A useful summary using the raw data is presented in Table 3.
A robustness exercise involves exploiting the three categories in our dependent variable
(distinguishing between vote/lean Trump, vote/lean Clinton and “Don’t know yet”). Very
similar results obtain (and are available upon request).

IV. v. Interpretation
A common assumption about competence is that it involves vertical differentiation, so that
people of different ideological predisposition should agree that more of it is better. This is
the way competence is incorporated in our model in section II. Under this “common
assumption”, our results provide evidence that reject what we call the “standard” model for
some groups of voters (rural and low education whites). Instead, the evidence is consistent
with a model where subjects treated with the importance of competence in policymaking
understand that the chances of feeling betrayed are higher with a more competent
policymaker. Thus, other things equal, they choose a less competent policymaker even if this
implies a higher chance of being on a lower material payoff. The expectation under this
assumption is that subjects would tend to agree with the idea that different forms of
“competence” help in policymaking. In particular, rural and low education non-rural whites
should be more likely to agree with our statements about the importance of “competence”
for policymaking.
An alternative assumption is that there is no agreement regarding what competence means.
“Competence” could mean belonging to a more interventionist, left wing party, to a more
deregulatory, right wing party or, in the extreme, “competence” could be synonymous with
the ability to steal. In other words, competence is either an ideological category or, if it is a
non-ideological category, it has the opposite sign than what the confused elites allege (more
of it is worse for everyone).34 If this view were correct, we would expect subjects to disagree
with the idea that different forms of “competence” help in policymaking. In particular, rural
and low education non-rural whites should be less likely to agree with our statements about
the importance of “competence” for policymaking.
Table 4 studies how the two groups that are seen as particularly receptive to populist
rhetoric, namely rural subjects and low education non-rural whites, answer questions about
competence. These questions are part of the treatment (so we focus only on treated subjects)
and focus on three dimensions of competence, which we call Complex, Technical and
Practical.
It starts by affirming a key feature of competence, namely that not everyone has it
(“Nowadays problems in economic policy can be so complex that few people in government
fully understand them.”). It then explicitly addresses the non-ideological dimension of
support, albeit in the direction of their group’s preference.
It may be paradoxical that the elite’s are the ones that are confused. Stephen Bannon, an adviser to Donald
Trump, had a radio show that catered to “those ‘low-information’ citizens who are mocked and ridiculed by
their ‘betters’ - the clueless elites.” See The Washington Post, November 20, 2016.

34

18

competence. We create a variable (called Complex), which is the extent to which they agree
with the idea that complex problems in policy cannot be answered with ideology and that
“few people in government fully understand them”. Column (1) finds that rural subjects are
less likely than those that are urban and sub-urban to agree with this statement. The average
for the sample is 6.5 (std. dev. 1.86) so the effect represents a reduction equivalent to 11% of
a standard deviation. In column (4) we observe a somewhat similar reaction by low
education non-rural whites. The effect is similar (though significant only at the 11% level).
Column (2) studies Technical, a variable designed to capture the technical demands of
understanding policy and link it to obtaining a degree at an elite school. Again rural subjects
don’t agree as much with this idea, significant at the 5.4% level. The mean for Technical is
6.3 (std. dev. 2.17), so the difference with non-rural (urban and sub-urban) subjects is
equivalent to 10% of a standard deviation. Column (5) shows that low education non-rural
whites have the opposite reaction: they are more likely than other subjects to agree with the
idea that there are technical demands that can be learned through formal education. The
estimated effect, which is significant at the 1% level, involves an increase equivalent to
almost 15% of a standard deviation in Technical.
Finally, column (3) studies Practical, which aims to capture the practical demands of
policymaking and link it to obtaining practical experience through work or participation in
corporate boards. The mean of Practical is 7.3 (std. dev. 1.74), so there seems to be more
agreement on the benefits of practical than on technical knowledge in policymaking. The
coefficient on Rural is insignificant in column (3) but in column (6) the dummy on Low
Education, White, Non-rural is positive and significant at the 2.3% level, implying an
increase equivalent to 13% of a standard deviation in Practical.
The general conclusion emerging from these data for the whole sample favors the “common
assumption”: the average answer on each of the three dimensions of competence exceeds 5
(ranging from 6.3 to 7.3), indicating agreement with the idea that competence is helpful in
the design of policy. There is of course substantial variation in answers (note that in
Technical, one standard deviation takes you below 5).
Before turning to the results for specific groups (as studied in Table 4), we note as
background that Table B has revealed that 65% of the overall sample of 3,532 subjects
report that the phrase “Understands details of policies and how to implement them” applies
to Clinton more than Trump. The 969 rural subjects are more skeptical of Clinton, but still
51% of them are willing to accept that the phrase applies more to her than to Trump while
only 18.3% of them think it applies more to Trump. Interestingly, 63% of 707 low education
non-rural whites answer that the phrase applies more to Clinton than to Trump, while 14.5%
say it applies more to Trump than to Clinton.
Turning to the specific results, we note that the answers given by rural subjects are, on
average, more in line with the “alternative assumption” whereas low education non-rural
whites are more in line with the “common assumption” about competence. This can be seen
in the negative coefficients on Rural in the Complex and Technical regressions in columns
(1-2) of Table 4. Rural subjects are less likely to agree with the ideas of competence
summarized in Complex and Technical than the rest of the sample. In contrast, the
evaluations of low education whites living in non-rural areas differ across dimensions.
Whereas they are somewhat less likely than the rest of the sample to agree with competence
as summarized by Complex (statistically insignificant), they are more likely to agree with

competence as summarized by Technical (comfortably significant) and Practical (statistically
significant) in columns (5-6) in Table 4. This group’s reaction to competence is consistent
with what we call the “common assumption” of competence as a good (implying that people
of different ideological bends should agree that more of it is better). This group of subjects
agrees that technical and practical competences are helpful in policy-making. And yet, when
they are treated with the importance of these dimensions of competence, they are less
inclined to vote for the more competent candidate.
Our model can resolve the apparently contradictory answers in the treatment and voting
regressions; where people appear to agree in the former with the idea that competence
matters in politics but then vote in the latter for the less competent candidate, as
follows. When the treatment group is asked about competence, respondents are considering
the "typical case" where B and q are low and broadly agree with the common assumption
that competence is a good thing. When asked specifically about their voting intentions, they
focus on the current election, and certain groups of voters view this as a special case where
B and q are high so that they switch from finding Clinton acceptable to supporting Trump.
We expect, of course, that alternative interpretations for our combination of results can be
produced. It seems to us, however, that alternative explanations will need to take into
account the fact that the people who change their minds as a result of our treatment are
people who already have a weak preference for the candidate that is viewed as more
competent, a feature they generally like. The treatment's effectiveness in reducing their
support for Clinton suggests that some of the other reasons for preferring Clinton (her
program, for example) are being devalued by our treatment.

Conclusion

The “stab in the back” was an image that became popular amongst right-wing German
groups after the First World War as an explanation for Germany’s predicament. It
emphasized the idea that unpleasant groups (Jews, socialists, elite politicians) were
responsible for engineering Germany’s defeat (and for the terms of the surrender) even
though the German army had not been defeated in the field. It singles out a key theme in
populist discourse: betrayal. A second feature of populist rhetoric is disdain for scientific or
technical competence, as traditionally embraced by elites. Is it possible that these two
elements –betrayal and competence- are connected?
We present a psychological model in which they are. We present a simple theory of
populism as demand for insurance against betrayal. Incompetent politicians deliver less
material well-being to voters but are less capable of betraying their trust. Under the
assumption that a certain level of income delivers less utility to voters when it is the result of
another person’s decision than when it is the result of bad luck (see, Bohnet and Zeckhauser,
2004), the model can yield a demand for incompetent leaders. The driving force of populism
in our model is the lack of effective means of controlling potentially corrupt politicians. The
only option available to voters that are betrayal-averse is to elect an incompetent politician
who, at some material cost, will deliver fewer scenarios where a bad material outcome is the
result of elite betrayal. Our model has three attractive features: it goes beyond the
interpretation of populism as simply left wing, capturing instead an anti-scientific bias
dimension. This makes our approach consistent with the evidence present in a large
20

literature in political science discussing aspects of populism that do not fit into a simple leftright divide. Second, it captures the intuition that voters who are not doing well
economically are likely to feel worse off/betrayed if the politician in charge was particularly
competent. This is a direct consequence of the assumption that voters are betrayal averse
and that competence (sometimes) matters. Third, it incorporates a standard theme in
populist accounts (betrayal) through a well-specified psychological mechanism.
We then present “minimal” evidence consistent with these ideas. The week prior to
the US 2016 election, we ask a sample of Americans (through Amazon’s M-Turk) about
their voting intentions. Prior to eliciting vote preferences we ask a subset of our sample their
opinion about three statements explaining the “complex” nature of “technical” challenges to
good policymaking, and about the increased importance of competence, gained both
through education in elite institutions and through practical experience. This “minimal”
intervention was designed to prime subjects about the importance of competence in
policymaking. Our findings are intriguing. Subjects in general describe Clinton as more
competent than Trump and Trump voters perceive a lot of corruption. There is no general
effect of the “minimal” treatment. We then allow for a differential reaction by different
demographic groups. In particular, we separate the reactions of those in rural areas, and
whites, with low education living in non-rural areas. Our preferred specification reveals that
the treatment priming subjects with the importance of competence in policymaking leads
them, on average, to increase the support for the candidate deemed more competent by
pundits and by the public in our sample (Hillary Clinton) by over 5 percentage points. In
contrast, treated rural subjects were almost 5 percentage points more likely to vote for Trump
than untreated rural subjects. Finally, urban and suburban low education whites that were
treated were 7 percentage points more likely to vote for Trump relative to subjects in that
same group but untreated.
In summary, we present results consistent with accounts in political science and
sociology, where populist candidates have some appeal particularly when the elites declare
them to be incompetent. The simplest possible interpretation is that “competence” as
defined by the elites is correlated with something bad for the non-elites. Another possibility,
explored in our model, is that feelings of betrayal in bad times are more prevalent when a
politician is competent. The evidence certainly suggests that populist politics has a
competence dimension, and that it does not evoke similar reactions in all groups. It may thus
have been a mistake to emphasize Clinton’s technical competence with two groups of voters
(rural and low educated whites). Interestingly, these are the two groups of voters that pundits
declared to be susceptible to populist rhetoric.

Column (1) reports the distributions of answers for the question: “The support for Clinton has been
summarized as follows:
In the current US election, Hillary Clinton stands out for her work ethic and for her attention to detail. She
has a law degree from an elite institution (Yale University), she has launched many social initiatives since
entering politics (such as the Arkansas Advocates Children and Families) and she has learned how real
business works (for example, by serving on several corporate boards).
One advocate explained: “Even Hillary Clinton’s sharpest critics will concede that she is exceptionally
well-informed. Unusually for a presidential candidate, she’s spent a lot of time in what were in effect staff
jobs rather than principal jobs — roles in which knowing what she’s talking about was a key part of the
position.”
Do you agree with this?
A slide from 0 to 10 is presented with cursor initially placed on 5, and with the words “Disagree
completely” below the number 0 and “Agree completely” below 100.
Columns (2-4) are the answers to “Please tell me which phrase you associate with each candidate:” Column (2):
“Elitist, out of touch”, Column (3): “Popular, in synch with most Americans”, Column (4) “Understands
details of policies and how to implement them”.

Nowadays problems in economic policy can be so complex that few people in government fully understand
them. Sometimes, for example, the best course of action is to reduce regulations (as was the case with the entry
of low-cost airlines), while at other times it would have been good to increase regulations (as was the case with
financial products before the crisis).
Dependent variable in column (2) and (5) is Technical, the answer to “Please tell me whether you agree with
the following statements: (scale from 0 to 10, with 0=Completely disagree, 10=Completely agree): Politicians
that understand technical matters can evaluate policies better and engage in a productive dialogue with industry
and private interests. A good education, for example at a top university, is one of the ways a politician can gain
such technical knowledge.”

Survey on Politics and the Current Elections
You are being asked to take part in a survey being done by a group of researchers from Harvard University that
will help us learn more about the relationship between politics, government and policy design in the context of
the current election.
The survey should take you less than 10 minutes. Please select the link below to complete it. At the end of the
survey, you will receive a code to paste into the box below to receive credit for taking our survey (you will
receive $1 for completing it).
If you have any questions, please contact us at rditella@hbs.edu. The survey is anonymous, and no one will be
able to link your answers back to you. Participation is voluntary and you are free to stop participating at any
time. Please do not include your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Please make
sure to mark your Amazon Profile as private if you do not want it to be found from your Mechanical Turk
Worker ID. Finally, we encourage you to screenshot or print this screen for your own records, so that you able
to retain our contact information.

Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful

4.

Please tell me whether you agree with the following statements: (scale from 0 to 10, with
0=Completely disagree, 10=Completely agree; labels for Disagree and Agree were also
shown)
4.1. Nowadays problems in economic policy can be so complex that few people in
government fully understand them. Sometimes, for example, the best course of action is to
reduce regulations (as was the case with the entry of low-cost airlines), while at other times it
would have been good to increase regulations (as was the case with financial products before
the crisis).
4.2. Politicians that understand technical matters can evaluate policies better and engage in a
productive dialogue with industry and private interests. A good education, for example at a
top university, is one of the ways a politician can gain such technical knowledge.
4.3. Politicians can also improve their ability to find solutions to complex problems through
practical experience, either work related or through participation in corporate boards.

slide: 0 out o10 10/10

9.

The support for Clinton has been summarized as follows:

In the current US election, Hillary Clinton stands out for her work ethic and for her attention to detail. She
has a law degree from an elite institution (Yale University), she has launched many social initiatives since
entering politics (such as the Arkansas Advocates Children and Families) and she has learned how real
business works (for example, by serving on several corporate boards).
One advocate explained: “Even Hillary Clinton’s sharpest critics will concede that she is exceptionally
well-informed. Unusually for a presidential candidate, she’s spent a lot of time in what were in effect staff
jobs rather than principal jobs — roles in which knowing what she’s talking about was a key part of the
position.”
Do you agree with this?
