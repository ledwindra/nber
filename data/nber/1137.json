    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper is a cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between common stock price reactions to announcements of convertible security calls and variables that represent possible determinants of changes in common stockholders' wealth. The variables are measures of the following effects of convertible security calls: (1) the change in interest expense tax shields, (2) the potential redistribution of wealth from common stockholders to preferred stockholders and debt holders,(3) the decrease in the value of conversion privileges heldby convertible security holders, (4) the relative increase in shares outstanding and (5) the change in earnings per share. A significant relationshipis found only between the measure of the reduction in interest expense tax shields and the stock price response to call announcements.The apparent corporate tax effect is consistent with some combination of effects due to (1) a reduction in interest expense tax shields and (2) unfavorable information about the calling firm's value of earnings prospects that is conveyed by a call of convertible securities.The evidence is consistent with theories of capital structure that imply optimal financial leverage depends on earnings prospects and with theories that imply reductions in leverage convey unfavorable information about firm value.\n\n",
