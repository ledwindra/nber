Heteroskedasticity—consistent Estimation of the
Variance-Covariance Matrix for the Almost Ideal Demand System
ABSTRACT

In this note I demonstrate the previously overlooked fact that if
the AIDS aggregate demand model is constructed as the aggregation of
individual consumer demands, then the error structure for any individual
equation is necessarily heteroskedastic unless the distribution of Income

is constant across aggregates. Maximum likelihood estimation which
ignores this heteroskedasticity yields inconsistent estimates of the
variance-covarlance matrix and renders likelihood ratio tests of the

restrictions of consumer demand theory inappropriate. A
heterokedasticity—consistent estimator of the variance—covariance matrix
Is proposed by adopting the technique of White (1980) to the case at
hand.

Introduction

The Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) has quickly become a popular
functional form for estimation and testing of consumer demand theory

since its introduction by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980).1 AIDS provides a
first order approximation to any arbitrary demand system, and can
"almost" be made consistent with classica) demand theory through linear

resrictions on the parameters of the system.2 Since most empirical
applications of consumer demand theory employ aggregate data, the
desirable aggregation properties of AIDS renders it a particularly useful
functional form.3
In this note I demonstrate the previously overlooked fact that if
the AIDS aggregate demand model is constructed as the aggregation of
individual consumer demands, then the error structure for any individual
equation is necessarily heteroskedastic unless the distribution of income

is constant across aggregates. Maximum likelihood estimation which
ignores this heteroskedasticity yields inconsistent estimates of the
variance—covariance matrix and renders likelihood ratio tests of the

restrictions of consumer demand theory inappropriate. A
heterokedasticity—consistent estimator of the variance—covariance matrix
is proposed by adopting the technique of White (1980) to the case at
hand.

2. The AIDS Model and Aggregation
Muellbauer (1975, 1975) has shown that exact aggregation with respect
to AIDS is possible if the demand system takes the form

3

log Pj + ak

log Exhi/khi.P,) +

where

is the expenditure share for the hth consumer of the kth

commodity in the Ith aggregate, Pj is the price of the jth commodity
(faced by all consumers in aggregate I), Xhj is an error term which Is

assumed to be iid across consumers and homoskedastic. P is a price
index defined by

and ak, k' Tkj are parameters to be estimated.
The term xhj/khi in (1) is called an "income equivalent" and can be
interpreted as the total expenditure by consumer h such that, if

different consumers h with different preferences faced the same prices,

they would choose the same expenditure shares of the commodities. This
specification allows for a limited amount of taste variation among
consumers without requiring linear Engel curves for exact aggregation to
be valid.

Aggregating (1) over all consumers in the ith aggregate yields

and, following Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), we define the aggregate
index k by

(6)

log(xhi/khi)

I

where x is the average expenditure per consumer in aggregate i. The
aggregate k1 is viewed as a distributional entropy index, measuring the

distribution of consumer characteristics withing aggregate i. Aside from
the problem of determining k1, (3) is applicable to aggregate data and
will, in principle, yield estimates of the parameters of the individual

consumer's demand system. in most applications of AIDS where aggregation
has been considered explicitly, k1 has been assumed constant over i or
uncorrelated with

or Pjj due to lack of appropriate data (Deaton and

Muellbauer (1980), Veall and Zirirermann (1986)).

Assuming that Chki is homoskedastic implies that Cki is
heteroskedastic, since

V(Eki) =

where v(chki) =

The degree of heteroskedasticity

depends on the unknown expenditure of alcohol distribution in the

i—th aggregate. Note that

ki

is homoskedastic in general only if xhl/Xi

is independent of i, which will occur if the distribution of income is

5

constant across aggregates.

The heteroskedaticity cannot be modelled since it is inherently

unobservable.5 However by adapting a procedure due to White (1980), it
is possible to calculate a heteroskedaticity—consistent variance—
covariance matrix

for

the parameter estimates.

3. A Heteroskedasticity—consistent Varlance—Covarfance Matrix for AIDS
We begin by using a fundamental statistical relation: the
asymptotic variance—covariance matrix of a maximum likelihood estimator
is equal to the inverse of the variance—covariance matrix of the gradient
of the likelihood function (Kendall and Stuart (1967), Vol. II, p. 9,
Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman (1974), p. 657).

Suppose we write the system of equations (1) in the form

In order to find a consistent estimate of V(j) we first consider the
from ML estimation when heteroskedasicity is

Ignored. This residual will provide the key to obtaining a consistent

estimate of V().
Normalizing A11 (the first observation In the first aggregate) to be
unity, an estimation of Ait. 1, t not both =

t =

From White's (1980) extension of his Theorem 1 to the non—linear
case (p. 821). it is clear that utilizing Att along with consistent

estimates of if

and I will yield a consistent estimate of V(fi).

The simplest way of completing this estimation problem is to use a
standard systems estimation computer program to find the maximum
likelihood estimator whose variance—covariance matrix is a consistent

estimate of the inverse of (13). Let ! be a transformation of both sides
of equation (8) which results in the gradient
