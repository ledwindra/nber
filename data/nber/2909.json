In particular, the paper tries to answer the following questions: What model or framework does the IMF use to generate its advice, and is that advice eclectic? Is there evidence that countries that followed the IMF's advice do better than countries that proceed in other ways? Are the policy decisions of the Fund based on technical knowledge or do they reflect the political views of the larger members? Is the IMF position regarding the debt crisis conducive to a realistic solution? What can we expect from the Fund in the future? The paper also includes an evaluation of recent IMF programs, as well as an econometric analysis of the contractionary devaluation issue.\n\n",
