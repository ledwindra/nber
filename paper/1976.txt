The Wage-Productivity Hypothesis:
It's Economic Consequences and Policy Implications for L.D.C..s

ABSTRACT

This paper explores the implications for less developed countries o
the hypothesis that workers' productivity depends on the wages they
receive. In particular, we show that this hypothesis may explain the
high urban wages and unemployment found in many such countries.
The market equilibrium is shown not to be pareto efficient. If the
government could not control urbaxv'rural migration, but could control
wages and urban employment, it would, in general, set wages and
employment levels differently. The sources of Inefficiency are
identified. The (constrained) pareto optimal policy can be implemented
via taxes and subsidies; but two instruments (both specific and ad
valorern wage tax/subsidies) are required.
More generally, policy changes will affect both the urban wage and
the level of unemployment, and these consequences need to be taken into
accounce, both In the determination of shadow wages to be used In co3t
benefit analysis and In the analysisis of the incidence of any set of
taxes and subsIdIes. The shadow price of labor may differ markedly from
what it would be if wages were arbitrarily fixed and there were no
migration. In particular, in the special case of the HarrisTodaro
migration model, with fixed rural wages and productivity depending only
on the absolute wage received, the shadow wage is the market wage,
regardless of the relative evaluation of current and future consumption.
Shadow prices under other specifications of the wage'productlvlty
relationship are analyzed.

The Wage—Productivity Hypothesis: Its Econo!rlc

Consequences and Policy mplicatlons for L.D.C. 's

by

Josepn E. Stlglitz

Under a variety of circumstances, the wage which a firm pays has an

important effect on the productivity of its labor force. This simple

observation has profon Implications on the nature of market
equllibriim. It implies, for instance, that there may be competitive
equilibria In which demand doe3 not equal supply: wages may not be cut,
even in the face of an excess supply of labor, for to do so mIght lower
the productivity of the labor force more than proportionately to the

reduction in the wage, and hence labor costs would rise. The law of

supply and denand is repealed! It also implies that, since the wage
productivity relationship may differ for different jobs, equilibrium may
be characterized by (ex ante) Identical workers receiving different

characterized by a wage

f

the

ware

productivity curves characterizing different groups differ, there may be
high rates of unemployment In some groups while other groups are fully

employed. Moreover, reductions in the demand for labor (associated,
say, with business cycles) may have their Impact concentrated on

particular groups, those for whom the (maximal) ratio of proctlvIty to
wage Is lowest. Cyclical reductions in demand may be accompanied by
layoffs rather than work sharing (as predicted by most of the standard
Implied contract theory).
This paper Is particularly concerned with explorinc some of the

policy implications in the context of' L.D.C.'s, e.g. for wage sus1die
and shadow pricing. The fact that the wage is endogenously determ inec,
rather than arbitrarily given, has, we believe, some important
consequences which may be fundamentally different from those in which,
say, the urban wage is arbitrarily set at a level above that which would

clear the market. Such models provide no Insight Into what will happen

when the government changes some policy. In particular, they provide no
insight into the circumstances in which such changes will lead to

changes in the urban wage. A central thesis of this risearch is that
policy changes will affect the urban wage, and thus affect the level of'

unemployment; and that these consequences need to be taken into account,
for instance, both in the determination of shadow wages to be used in

cost benefit analysis and in

the

analysis of the full incidence of' any

st of taxes and subsidies.
We show that the presence of unemployment of wages in excess of the

mar<et clearing level does not, in itself, indicate that tne economy is

inefficient. In a planned economy, wages too might well be in excess of
the market clearing level. On the other hand, In the class of models
with which we are concerned here, there Is no presumption that the
competitive equilibrium Is efficient; and in particular, that the level

of i.employment which emerges In the maret equilibrium •* what
macrofteconomists might be tempted to refer to as the natural level of
unemployment

has any optimality properties.

This paper is divided into five sections. In section I, we revie.
the basic arguments for why wages affect productivity; section II
discusses the implications of the dependence of productivity on wages

for marks €quillbrIurn. Section III assesses the efficiency of the
market equilibrium. The presence of unemployment, of wages In exceos of
the market clearing level, does not, in itself, Indicate that the

economy Is Inefficient. In a planned economy, wages too m1t well be
in excess of the market clearing level. We show, however, that there Is
no presumption that the competitive equilibrium is efficient; and In
particular, that the level of une:nployment which emerges in the market
equilibrium, what macroseconornists might be tempted to refer to as the

natural level of unemployment, has any optimality properties. Section
IV then explores the policy implications, focusing in particular on the

implications for tax policy and cost benefit analysis. Section V
presents some concluding remarks.

I. Why do Wages Affect Productivity.
There are a large number of reasons that a firm may expect that an
Increase in the wage it pays may have a positive effect on the

productivity of its labor force.

(a) The efficiency wage hypothesis. Tnis is the oldest explanation
provided within the development literature (see e.g. Leibenstein).2

hen workers are close to the subsistance level, then increases in their
nutritiomal level and

health

care will lead to an increase In their

productivity.3 An Increase In wages is generally believed to result In
an Increase In nutrition and hence in productivity. The relationship
between the paid by
labor

force,

'j,

is

the

Ith firm, wage, w1 and the productivity of its

conventionally depicted as in figure 1, wIth an

Initial region in which increases In wages lead to more than

proportionate increases In productivity. We write

A11(w1), A'>O, A1"(w1)<> 0 as w1 <>

w

(1)

The curve Sho.4s that for low wages, Increases in wages have a marked
(and an Increasing) effect on productivity; at high wages, however,

diminishing returns sets In: though Increases In wages continue to
increase productivity somewhat, the increment in productivity from each

successive increase in wage becomes smaller and smaller. The shape of
the curve is Important for many of the results obtained below.
If the urban worker Is sharing his wage with family members in the
rural sector who receive a wage of Wr, then the productivity of an urban
worker will depend not only on the firm's wage, Wj; but also on the
rural wage w

hypothesis.

Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in productivity from a iven
change In wages will he smaller than It would be if they did not share.
As a consequence, firms may attempt to provide meals and health care to
their workers, to ensure that a larger proportion of the wage Is sent

on productivity enhancing expenditures. They may also subsidize other

prduct1vIty enhancing expenditures, e.g. through a company store.

where p Is the price

dissipation of the benefits of high wages from sharing. If the worker

are

employed elsewhere in the urban sector, then productivity may he

explanation of the dependence of A on the

unemployment rate is that individuals go Into debt during job search;
they must repay these debts after obtaining employment, thus reducing
the funds available for consumption.
In the limiting case where the interest rate is zero arid where

Individuals engage In rent seeking activity to the point where the
lifetime consumption of the individual who obtain the high wage jobs is

is the vector of' wage3 paid by other firms. Since we focus on
symmetric equilibria, all components of w are identical.

an increase in the wage increases expenditures on job search, Lt does

not increase labor productivity.5 3ut this is an extreme case. If
there is a positive interest rate, then even if lifetime expected
utilities are equalized by rent seeking expenditures, consumption during

periods of employment will be higher in high wage firms. Moreover, to
the extent that this is an important problem, firms 1ll he induced to
recruit workers In ways which ameliorate these effects.

(b) Labor turnover. A second Important way that workers' behavior

affects the productivity of firms Is through labor turnover.6 In most
jobs, there are costs of hiring and training which are specific to the

firm. So long as individuals do not pay these full costs at the moment
they are hired (recouping them later In the form of higher wages', them
the greater the quit rate, the greater the firm's expenditures om

training and hiring costs. Increasing the wage rate will, in general,
l•ad to a reduction In the quit rate, and hence to an increase in the
profits of the firm.

The retention rate r (which equals one minus the quit rate and
hence the turnover costs, depend on the relationship between the given

firm's wage and all other wages in the economy. Lower wage individuals
have a higher probability of finding a job at a higher wage, and thus of

Assuming, that is, that productivity depends on 1ifet1me consumption,
or, if it depends on current consumption, at a zero interest rate
individual smooth their con.gumption evenly throughout their life.
61n the context of developed countries, this hypothesis has been
explored by Salop (1973), Stlglitz (1972, 1985), and Hall (1975) among
others. In the context of less developed countries, eee Stiglltz
(19714).

quitting. This is true whether there Is costly search, or whether all
individuals apply to all firms offering a higher wage than

their present

firm, au the firm simply randomly picks among the ap:licants.
1oreover, the greater the unemployment rate, the less likely it is that

the worker will find a better job. Thus, in this hypothesis

r=r (w1,

,

w,

U),

()

r1>O,r2<o,r3<o,r,>O

The effect of higher quite rates Is to decrease the "net"
productivity (net of turnover cost). Firms would not have to pay higher
wages to reduce turnover costs if either (a) they could force workers to
sign binding contracts; or (b) workers paid for all of the training

costs. Indentured servitude Is,

in most

coxitries,

illegal.

As an empirical matter, It appears that workers seldom pay the full
turnover costs at the moment they are hired; and so long as workers are
risk averse and there Is some chance that they will leave the firm
(either because they are badly "matched" with the firm or because of
some

exogenous reasons which Induces them to leave) the optimal contract

between the firm and the worker will entail the firm bearing some of the
risks associated with the costs of labor turnover (so turnover will be

costly to the firm). (See Arnott and Stlglitz [19853). There are
further reasons for workers not bearing the entire costs of training and
hiring. Workers may have insufficient capital; arid the costs

training

and

hiring

of

may not be verifiable. Were the worker to have to

pay the full training and hiring costs, there might be an incentive for
firms to overstate these costs, and

then

to fire workers, making a

profit out of the difference between the payments and

the

true training

costs.

(c) Incentive Effects.7 It Is, in general, costly to monitor

workers. If there were no unemployment and if all firms paid the market
clearing wage, then the threat of being fired would not lead individuals
to reduce their shirking: they would know that they could quickly obtain

another job. But If firms pay wage In excess of that of other firms, or
if there Is unemployment (so that a fired worker must spend a period in
the unemployment pool before he again obtains a job) then workers have

an Incentive not to shirk; there Is a real cost to being fired.
This again gives rise to a productivity wage relationship of the
form (3), with

An increase in other's wages reduces productivity, an increase in

unemployment increases productivity.

Cd) Morale Effects. It is sometimes postulated that an Individual's
behavior Is affected by his views of how fairly he is being treated, or
more generally, how he sees himself being treated in relationship to

Tme Incentive effect of paying high wages, within the context of
developed countries, has been analyzed by Shapiro and Stiglitz (198),
Calvo (1979), and Calvo and Phelps (1977).

full

analysis of this motive for paying higher wages again requires
an investigation into alternative methods of providing incentives. One
such method is to provide a bond, which the individual forfeits if he
shirks. The difficulties with this are similar to those discussed
above. Alternatively, the firm cotfid threaten to lower the wage of any
individual caught shirking. But lowering the wage simply Increases the
likelihood that the individual will shirk in subsequent periods, and
hence Is not an effective incentive device. (See Shapiro and Stig].itz).

otners. Thus, the wage relative to others' wages enters into the
utility function, and consequently also enters Into the effort supply
function.9

(e) Quality effects.° Changes In the wage affect the mix of
applicants for a job. If reservation wages are correlated with
productjvltjes on the job, by offering a higher wage,

a firm

obtains, on

average, a higher quality labor force.11 Again, in this hypothesis th
productivity of the worker is a function of the wage paid by the given
firm relative to the wages paid by all other firms.12

(f) Recruitment effects. It is costly for firms to recruit workers,

particularly to find workers who are "well*matched" with the firm. Fve
If search were costless, a firm paying a higher wage would have a larger
applicant pool among which to choose workers, and this would enable his.

tc recruit a more productive labor force.13

9Like the previous explanation, this requires that it be costly to
monitor the actual leveL of effort put out by the individual. For a
discussion of evidence for this effect in the psychological literature,

see Akerlof, 198L. For an earlier dicusjon of these morale effects,
see Stiglltz, 1973, 197'4a.

101n the context of developed countries, this model has been explored by
Stiglitz (1976a), Weiss (1980), and Nalebuff and Stlglltz. For L.D.C.'s
see Stiglltz (1982a).

The assumptions that firms can Imperfectly observe the inputs of
individuals (as in the previous two explanations), and that they can
imperfectly screen individuals prior to hiring them are critical.
Moreover, we also require that individuals not be able to guarantee
their peformancc (either for one of the reasons presented above, or
because individuals are risk averse, and Imperfectly informed concerning
their skills relative to the job.)
12When workers are heterogeneous, there is not, In general, a single
rural wage; what turns out to be relevant for most of the analysis Is
the wage of the marginal migrant. When labor is heterogeneous, this is

II. Implications

of the

Dependence

of productivity on sages for rnar-:et

equilibrium.

Regardless of the explanation, the dependence of productivity on
wages has one critical consequence: firms may not lower wages in the

presence of an excess supply of laDor. For to lower the wage will lower
the productivity of the labor force, and if its prouctivitv is lowerec
enough, the profits of the firm will be reduced.

131n models with costly search, it may take some time before a firm Is
successful In filling a vacancy. The expected length of time is
dependent on the wages the firm pays. The effect of this is analagous
to that of a direct Increase in productivity resulting from a wage
increase.

(10)

may be less than the supply; nonetheless firms will not be induced to

lower their wages. A firm knows that an unemployed worker who offers tc
work for a wage less than w will have a lower productivity, a
sufficiently lower productivity that its labor costs will be higher, an:
its profits lower.

This argument holds, with equal force, for any of the other
explanations we have proferred for the dependence of productivity on

wages. Thus, for instance, in the labor turnover model firms will not
lower their wages, even in the face of an excess supply of labor,
knowing that If they do so, they will face higher turnover costs, which
may more than offset the direct savings from the lower wages.
Though all of the models can yield equilibrium unemployment, the
different models do, however, differ in their welfare consequences and

policy Implications. Some of these differences we shall note below.

2.2 A eeral M9de1, In this section, we analyze the equilibrium of a

more general version of the wageproductivitY model.

We focus our

attention on symmetric equilibria, in which all firms in the urban

sector pay the same wage. Then the productivity curve facing the itn

In this version, a more productive work is just a "multiple" of a less

may be capital saving.)15

Is a functIon of the demand: just as we noted earlier thatthe demand for
labor Is a function of the unemployment rate, and hence indirectly of

supply. There Is not the simple dichotomy between supply and demand

Moreover, while in

traditional competitive supply and demand analysis, firms and workers
tre3t the wage parametrically, now firms

determine

the wage. Thus,

while traditional analysis depicts demand and supply as a function of
the wage, here, the wage

and the pseudo demand curve (21a), is depicted in figure 3.

2.3 Sorie Speoja]. Ga3e

To gain insight Into the nature of the equilibrium, It is useful to
Investigate three special cases of our

general model (22).

2.3.1 The aaoute wage hypotheLs.
In the first, we postulate that the production function taves on the
multiplicative

form. Then, as

we noted earlier, (16),

giving

the

optimal wage, takes on the simple form:
A1 /wi

=

A1/wj

If we now postulate further that proauctivity depends

(16')
simply on the

wage paid by the firm, the simple nutritional model (1), then the
efficiency wage (the solution to (16')) is independent of both the
number of workers In the urban sector, the unemployment rate, and the

employment level. Thus, (21b) takes on the simple form

pseudodemand curve is now straightforward:

(w*/A (w'))/A (w*).

Notice that the demand for labor is independent of the sup1y: th
pseudodemand curve is a vertical straight line. (See Figure L4a).
We focus

on the special supply equation (22' ) correspon1ng to the

HarrisTodaro Model. We simplify further by assuming a land surplus
economy, where the rural wage is independent of the number

We emphasize that this Is still not the most general model. We have,
in particular, Ignored the dependence of productivity on relative
prices. The omission of this would be particularly serious In the
analysis of a closed economy model, where the relative price of
agricultural and industrial goods affects industrial productivity. See
Sah and Stiglitz (1985).

cciceny of te Market qwiliFtur
The fact that some workers are unemployed suggests that resources

are not being used

efficiently.

However, assessing the efficiency of

the market In the presence of the wage*productivity nexis Is not an easy

matter. We need to specify what the government's objectives are, as
well as the set of available Instruments. If, for Instance, the
government could

control

migration directly, then It could eliminate

unemployment. It might, for instance, randomly assign some Individuals
to the high paying urban

jobs,

but require all other Individuals to

remain In the rural sector. Such control of migration requires a level
of repression that many L.D.C.'s find objectionable. Accordingly, the
more relevant question may be, It the government could control directly
the urban wage rate and the level of urban

emp1oymet

would It set these

variables at levels different from those of competitive markets?

iternat1veiy, the government may not be able to control

wae and

employment directly; it may have to resort to wage subsidies or taxes.

gould

the government wish to impose such subsidies taxes, and If so, at

what rates?
In this section, we assume the government has direct control of

output,

and then consider the more general objective of (constrained)

pareto efficiency.

Under the relative wage efficiency hypothesis, with a fixed rural

zero, employment is at the right level, contingent on the wage being

offered, but the wage may be either too large or too small. Which

depends on hether a proportionate increase In the employment rate has a
greater or less effect on productivity than a proportionate Increase in
the average urban wage.

Hence, from

U

(28a), it

is clear that employment, conditional on the we,

may be either too large or too small (since the above expression does
not depend on the properties of the productivity function but clearly
does, the right hand side of (28a) may be either positive or negative.)
Similarly, from (28b), it is clear that the wage may be either too

high or too low. While

dlnL,dlfl

will be less than unity if individuals are risk averse, the sign of b
depends on the sensitivity of productivity to changes in the average
urban wage relative to its sensitivity to the rural wage rate and the

level of unemployment.

3.2 ParQt efficiocy, The fact that the competitive allocation does
not maximize net national output does not Imply that the market economy

Is not pareto efficient. Pareto efficiency may be most easily examined
in the context of the case where the rural wage is fixed and hence

3.3 So&pces of Market Faj1pe. There are several sources of market
failure in this economy. First, firms fall to take into account the
effect of their wage and employment policy on the productivity of
workers at other firms, both directly and indirectly through their
effect on the unemployment rate and rural wages. (These productivity

externalities21 would arise regardless of the explanation of the

21Some of the externalities appear to be pecuniary externalities, which
in traditional economic theory do not interfere with the productive
efficiency of the economy. But the result that pecuniary externalities
(Footnote continued)

wageproductivlty relationship.) Some of these externalities are
positive, some are negative. Policies -which lead

to a reduced

unemployment rate are likely to reduce productivity (e.g. as a result of

incentive effects). Increases in productivity as a conseqence of a
higher quality applicant pool are at the expense of the quality of those
working at other firms, except to the extent that the wage/employment
policy has resulted in a better matching of workers with firms (on the
basis of comparative advantage.)
As a result, in this class of models the wage does not measure the

correct opportunity cost of labor. For instance, if the reason that
productivity Increases with the wage is that reservation wages are
correlated with productivity, then the applicant pool consists of all of
those whose productivity in the rural sector is less than the wage
offered by the firm; In that case, the wage clearly exceeds the
opportunity cost of a randomly selected applicant.
If by hiring an additional worker, more than one worker migrates
from the rural sector (to seek employment in the urban sector) the loss

in output exceeds the rural wage. Later, we present an example where
the loss in Output equals the urban wage.
Thro shout this section we have assumed that the government cannot

effect migration indirectly through subsidies to the rural sector. As
we show later, such subsidies are, in general, desirable (though It will
not be in the interest of any firm to provide such a subsidy). -

21(continued)
do not matter is special1 and does not hold In the class of models with
which we are concerned here, and more generally, as Greenwald and
StIglitz show (1985), in any economy In which there is Imperfect
information and/or an incomplete set of markets.

IV. Policy
Indirect Intepwention. Tne government can attempt

to

use taxes and

sbsidles to effect the constrained optimum. Since there were two
variables that the government controlled, it requires at least two

Instruments to attain the constrained optimum. In particular, If we
impose ad valorem and

then the market solution will be a constrained optimum.
Note that a pure ad valorem subsidy leaves unchanged the equation
for the optimal wage (dividing (38) by (37)) but does increase the level

of employment. Thus, in the pure wage efficiency model, where the
market wage was optimal, the governnent will only employ an ad valorem

wage subsidy. A specific wage subsidy will increase the wage paid: it
will be partly shifted backwards towards workers (see Figure 5).
If the wage subsidy is shifted backwards towards workers, it will

result in an increase in the unemployment rate, as depicted in figure 6.

this are described more fully below.

Additional Taxes. Although by assumption, the government cannot
directly control migration, it may be able to affect the level of
migration (and the associated unemployment) by providing subsidies to
the rural sector, financed, for instance, by
urban

sector.

In the pure efficiency wage model, such subsidies

unambiguously increase national output and lower unemployment. In

models where productivity in the urban sector is affected by the rural
wage, such a policy has a positive effect on rural output and a negative

effect on urban output. The optimal rural subsidy entails a balancing
of these two effects.
Shadow Prices. The models formulated in this paper have very different

implications for shadow pricing from those of the standard model. First
the opportunity cost of having an additional worker in the urban sector

depends critically on the effect this has on the unemployment rate. If
the government's hiring of an additional worker left unemployment
unchanged, it would imply an induced migration of 1/14U workers, and
hence a loss in output in the rural sector of

so that the o?portunity cost of hiring an additional worker is bust the

as in the labor turnover model or the incentive models)22 then U ill

(Footnote continued)

As figure 7 Illustrates, the new equilibrium level of unemployment
will be lower, provided the efficiency wage decreases with the

unempoy:nent rate. (But just the opposite occurs If the efficiency wage
increases witn U).

Note too, in the case where the rural wage is fixed, that changing
the level of urban employment has no effect on aggregate workers'
consumption; hence If all profits are invested, investment is maximized

by maximizing net national output. Regardless of the relative weight
associated with investment, the shadow price on labor Is the urban wage.
(Tnese results are In marked contrast to the earlier studies of Sen,
Marglin, etc., which ignored the endogenity of migration and of tirban

wage determination.)
If the rural wage increases as Individuals leave the rural sector,
then at a fixed urban wage, the unemployment rate wil be reduced, and
hence the opportunity cost of labor is less than the urban wage (but

still greater than the rural wage). The reduction in the unemployment
rate may lead to an increase in urban wage, but presumably by an amount
which Is less than proportionate to the rise in the rural wage.
V. Disequilibrium versus equilibrium models and wage dispersion.
In all of the models presented here, we have assumed that the wage

is determined endogenously. There is another important class of models
in which wages are set arbitrarily (say by custom, unions, or government

flat). Such models do not provide a basis for inferring what will

23

in the absolute wage model.

happen as a result of a change in, say, taxes, and thus provide an
inadequate basis for the analysis of policy.

Since the pure efficiency

wage model is one in which the wage does not depend either on the level
of' hirjn In the sector, on

unemployment, public employment, wages paid

by other firms, or ad valorem

subsidies, the analysis of the rigid wage

model corresponds (for these policy variables) to that special case of
our
the

general model. On the other hand, our
pure

model predicts that even In

efficiency wage model, a specific wage subsidy will have an

effect on wages paid in the urban sector.

In the c1sequIlibri models, the observed productivity differences
between different sectors (or different firms within a given sector) may

ce viewed as cause by differences In the exogeneously given waze. In
or more general equillbrjun formulation, there may exist differences In
the wages paid by different firms; labor turnover may be more important
to some firms than to others; physical health may be more Important in
some

occupations than in others; in such

cases, wages may be higher.

Even more interesting, however, Is the possibility that identical firms
(identical jobs) may pay different wages; the differences In wages being

perfectly

offset by differences In productivity. Equilibrium may be

characterized by wage disperion, even among otherwise Identical firms.
In these models, there is no single direction of causation: productivity
is higher because wages are higher, and wages are higher because
productivity Is higher.

This paper has considered only some of the Important facets of the
wage productivity nexus and its implications for development policy. It
has, not considered, for Instance, Important consequences for education
policy (whether education is for screening or human capital formation)

and investent

policy (includIng the allocation of capital between the

urban and rural sector). These are questions which we hope to explore
elsewhere.
