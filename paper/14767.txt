Commodity Market Disintegration in the Interwar Period

NBER Working Paper No. 14767
March 2009
JEL No. F13,F15,F59,N70
ABSTRACT
Using data collected by the International Institute of Agriculture, we document the disintegration of
international commodity markets between 1913 and 1938. There was dramatic disintegration during
World War I, gradual reintegration during the 1920s, and then a very substantial disintegration after
1929. The period saw the unravelling of a great many of the integration gains of the 1870-1913 period.
While increased transport costs certainly help to explain the wartime disintegration, they cannot explain
the post-1929 increase in trade costs. Protectionism seems the most likely alternative candidate.

1. Introduction
Since the early work of pioneers such as Jeffrey Williamson (1974), Knick Harley
(1978, 1980), John Hurd (1975) or Jacob Metzer (1974) there has been an explosion of work
documenting the integration of national and international commodity markets during the 19th
century. Successive papers have advanced the state of our knowledge along several
dimensions. A small minority (e.g. O'Rourke and Williamson 1994, Klovland 2005) have
documented patterns of price convergence or divergence for commodities other than the
grains which have been the focus of most papers. Some authors, notably Karl Gunnar
Persson (e.g. Persson 2004), have demonstrated the importance of comparing commodities of
identical qualities in different markets. And during the past decade or so, much more
sophisticated econometric procedures have been used to identify both the speed with which
commodity prices moved back to equilibrium after a shock, and the trade costs which
determined whether such an adjustment process would take place in the first place (e.g.
Ejrnaes and Persson 2000).
Recent work has broadened the scope of these investigations well beyond the late
19th century. David Jacks (2005, 2006) and Federico and Persson (2007) have established
that international commodity markets were becoming better integrated throughout the post­
1815 period, and not just after 1870. O'Rourke and Williamson (2002) find no evidence of
commodity market integration between continents before 1800, while the evidence provided
by Jacks (2004) and Özmucur and Pamuk (2007) for market integration within early modern
Europe is decidedly mixed. Meanwhile, international economists have recently started to
uncover evidence of international price convergence for a variety of consumer goods during
the late 20th century, although this finding is at odds with what little we know about
international agricultural markets during the same period (Engel and Rogers 2004, Goldberg
and Verboven 2005, Parsley and Wei 2002, O’Rourke 2002, Federico and Persson 2007).

2

Strikingly, however, there has been little or no work documenting price convergence
or divergence during the interwar period. This is surprising, since the years after 1929 saw a
collapse in world trade which has been extensively studied, as well as a rise in protectionism
which has also been the subject of much scholarly attention. One of the classic questions
which many have asked regarding the period is: can this post-1929 collapse in world trade
(documented in Figure 1) be attributed to the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 in the United
States, and equivalent import restrictions imposed elsewhere, or was it simply a reflection of
declining world output? Somewhat embarrassingly for economists to whom policies such as
Smoot-Hawley symbolise the folly of interwar economic policy-making, quantitative
analyses of the episode have tended to downplay the role of tariffs in explaining the world
trade slump, emphasising instead the role of falling demand and output (Irwin 1998).
However, Jacob Madsen (2001) argues that discretionary increases in protection were as
important as nominal income declines in explaining the post-1929 world trade slump.
Presumably, if trade barriers had contributed to the fall of world trade, then this would
have manifested itself in an increase in price gaps between markets, leading (ceteris paribus)
to an increase in import prices, a decline in export prices, and a decline in trade volumes, with
the size of all three effects depending upon elasticities of supply and demand. Increasing
price gaps is a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for protectionism to have had any effects
on world trade whatsoever. It thus seems as though the question of what happened to interwar
commodity market integration should be of interest not just to scholars of market integration
per se, but to those interested in the international economy of the period more generally. And
yet, very little work has been done on the subject to date. One exception is Federico and
Persson (2007), who look at world wheat markets over the past two centuries and find (using
annual data) that while these were extremely well integrated in the early 1920s, there was a
sharp increase in international price variance in the years after 1929. The aim of this paper is

3

to provide more such evidence, using higher-frequency data and more sophisticated
techniques, for a greater range of commodities, and to ask: what was the impact of World
War I on international commodity markets? To what extent did these recover during the
1920s? Did the years after 1929 see a further disintegration of international commodity
markets, and if so, was this disintegration severe enough to leave these markets less well
integrated than they had been before 1914? And what were the causes of the disintegration?
Was it due to rising transportation costs, as suggested by Estevadeordal, Frantz and Taylor
(2003), or to policy, or to some combination of the two?

2. Empirics
Data
The primary source for this study is the International Institute of Agriculture’s
International Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics. Although this publication provides a wealth
of information on international commodity markets during the interwar period, it has not yet
been exploited by economic historians, as far as we know. The Institute was founded in 1905
and headquartered in Rome. The IIA was a “world clearinghouse for data on crops, prices,
and trade to protect the common interests of farmers of all nations.” Thus, it was the first
international organization dedicated to the task of generating and publicizing world
agricultural data. Initially comprising forty nations, membership was extended to 51 by 1913.
It was succeeded in 1945 by the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
The first statistical Yearbook was produced in 1909 and covered a wide range of
statistical material, from land area and population to agricultural production and agricultural
prices. After World War I, these volumes were published in subsequent years from 1920 to
1939. Their express purpose was to document the changes in global commodity markets after
the First World War. To quote, “the opinion was widely held that world economy [sic] would

4

return to the position existing on the eve of the conflagration so that data for the years
immediately preceding the War could be taken in a sense to represent the normal and thus to
constitute a good basis of comparison” (International Institute of Agriculture, 1933).
The data collection efforts of the International Institute of Agriculture were
prodigious. They cover 374 weekly commodity price series over 46 commodity
classifications in locales as far-flung as Rangoon, Rio de Janeiro, and almost all conceivable
commercial ports in between. Of the 374 series, we are able to exactly match 27 commodityspecific city pairs. These range from (Danish, creamery for export) butter in Copenhagen and
London to (No. 2 winter, American) wheat in Chicago and Liverpool. The commodity and
temporal coverage of our exact matches is documented in Table 1. We note that the
International Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics potentially allows for an even larger number
of matches. However, we have employed a very conservative selection criterion to ensure
that differences in product quality can play no role in our results.
In the International Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics, all weekly prices were quoted
in local currencies and measurements. Quoted prices in the source country were converted
into the currency and measurement of the matched destination country. For instance, (Danish,
creamery for export) butter in Copenhagen was quoted in crowns per 100 kilograms and
converted into shillings per hundredweight based on standard physical conversion rates and
nominal exchange rates derived from the Global Financial Database.

Methodology
Our chief focus is on estimating trade costs—that is, the costs of physically
transporting goods across markets inclusive of freight rates, tariffs and non-tariff barriers to
trade—over the interwar period, with an especial regard to comparing these to conditions
prevailing on the eve of the First World War. In recent years, a voluminous literature has

5

emerged in economics and economic history on how to gauge the trade costs separating
markets on the basis of price differentials (Balke and Fomby 1997; Obstfeld and Taylor
1997). For instance, Jacks (2005, 2006) documents the process of market integration in the
context of the Atlantic economy by examining grain price data from over 100 markets in
Europe and North America from 1800 to 1913.
In contrast to earlier work which looked mainly at average annual price gaps between
markets, the modern literature has relied on methods directly based on or indirectly inspired
by the threshold autoregression approach first developed by Tsay (1989). Here, we adopt the
latter approach and make use of an extremely parsimonious model of commodity market
integration. The basic idea is that agents—given the prevailing costs of transport, tariffs and
non-tariff barriers to trade, the costs of obtaining credit and contracting in foreign exchange
markets, etc.—will exploit all profitable opportunities in terms of price differentials. In this
case, the basic arbitrage conditions will always be:
1.) Pt1  Pt 2  TC 21
2.) Pt 2  Pt1  TC 12
That is, the price in location 1 must be less than or equal to the price in location 2 plus
the trade cost associated with moving a given commodity from location 2 to location 1.
Likewise, the price in location 2 must be less than or equal to the price in location 1 plus the
trade cost associated with moving a given commodity from location 1 to location 2. Where
commodities are known to be moving in one direction only, say from location 1 (the source
city) to location 2 (the destination city), this implies that
3.) Pt 2  Pt1  M t21  TC12
In this case, the difference in prices for a given commodity and for a given city-pair will
follow a basic threshold auto-regression (TAR) process, whereby
4.) M t21   ( M t211  TC12 )   t .
6

In models of this class, λ is allowed to vary according to whether M t211 is below (that is,

M t211  TC12 ) or above (that is, M t211  TC12 ) the threshold defined by the trade cost term,

TC12 . If M t211  TC12 , then there are no profitable arbitrage opportunities available and λ is
equal to zero. However, if M t211  TC12 , then a profitable arbitrage opportunity exists, and we
assume that agents exploit such opportunities, which would imply that λ is negative.
The International Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics reports weekly observations on
commodity prices. Consequently, we are able to estimate TARs for every individual year
available. This comes at the cost of assuming a constant trade cost term for each year. Given
the slowly evolving dynamics of international shipping and commercial policy, this does not
seem to be too heroic an assumption. Finally, we are not open to the identification problem
highlighted by Coleman (2007). Given that the IIA reports exact commodity-specific citypair matches (for example, Danish creamery butter for export, in Copenhagen and London)
chosen to represent bilateral trading relations, the goods are traded between our city pairs by
definition, so there is little need to worry about the emergence of triangular arbitrage
shipments, which apparently characterised the pre-World War I gold trade between New
York City and London.

Results
Figure 2 illustrates the estimation procedure for a single commodity for a given citypair in a given year. Here, we consider the case of the market for Danish butter for export in
Copenhagen and London in 1913. Throughout the year, the price in shillings per
hundredweight is always higher in London than in Copenhagen. Thus, the margin informs us
about the likely size of the composite trade costs—that is, all the costs of transportation and
transaction involved in exporting Danish creamery butter from Copenhagen to London.

7

Price margins in hand, we estimate the trade cost term in equation 4.) above using the
finmetrics module in S-Plus. The procedure yields an estimate of 8.13 shillings per
hundredweight, depicted as the solid horizontal line, and a 95% confidence interval of (5.86,
8.58) depicted as the dashed horizontal lines in Figure 2. The associated speed of adjustment
parameter, ̂ , is -0.2925 with a standard error of 0.1395 (t-statistic = 2.10). In order to make
this figure for the speed of adjustment parameter more intuitive, it is common in the literature
to calculate the half-life of deviations from the (trade-cost-adjusted) law of one price using
the following formula:
5.)

ln(0.5)
.
ln(1 ̂ )

In this case, the estimated half-life of a shock to the pricing system is 2. That is, in 1913 it
took on average about two weeks until the arbitrage trade in butter reduced a pricing
deviation above the trade cost estimate between Copenhagen and London by 50 percent.
Thus, from 52 weekly observations on the price margin between two cities for a
particular commodity in a particular year, the procedure generates a set of annual estimates of
the trade cost separating these markets, as well as the adjustment speed. In what follows, we
concentrate on the trade cost estimates for two reasons. First, we are primarily interested in
the changes in the costs of doing trade between 1913 and 1939. It is these costs which would
have led to international commodity price gaps widening, assuming that this in fact
happened, and which would have reflected the impact of rising protectionism. At the same
time, there seems little reason to believe that the technology underlying the commodity trade
and, thus, determining the speed at which the commodities in our samples were shipped, or
prices arbitraged, radically changed in this period. These markets had witnessed the
introduction of such innovations as steamships and telegraphs well beforehand.1 Second, the
1

The inauguration of the Panama Canal in 1914 is an obvious exception to this general statement.
However, none of those city pairs for which we have price information in 1913 is likely to have been affected by

8

identification of the threshold parameter comes off the entire set of observations for a given
year (generally 52), while the identification of the adjustment parameter comes off the subset
of observations that the TAR routine determines to be most likely to be above the trade-cost
threshold, resulting in less precision.2
In any case, most of the estimated coefficients are significant at the 10 percent level,
and, as predicted, we always find a negative adjustment parameter  and a positive trade cost

TC. We combine these commodity-, city pair-, year-specific estimates of trade costs with
information on the average annual prices of the same commodities in destination cities to
arrive at a unit-less measure of trade costs which is comparable across commodities and
years. Tables 2a and 2b summarize the estimated trade costs as a share of destination market
prices for the 291 observations at our disposal.
The first finding which we want to discuss is the comparison between trade cost levels
in 1913 versus the post-war period. For the fourteen trade cost series at our disposal with
observations both in 1913 and in the post-war period, fully ten register an increase in trade
costs as a share of destination market prices. Regarding the four which register a decrease, we
note that three of these involved the trade in grains between North American and the United
Kingdom (oats between Winnipeg and London, wheat between Winnipeg and London, and
wheat between Chicago and London). These three exceptions are less surprising if we
consider the staggering heights of commercial activity in these trades—and presumably,
investment in the attendant handling and shipping facilities—achieved during World War I
(Food Research Institute, various years). Comparing trade costs in 1913 to those in 1922 for
those series with available data suggests that, on average, trade costs rose by 60%. The

its completion, as a quick review of Table 1 will confirm. We discuss interwar transportation technologies
further below.
2
In an exercise to follow, we estimate two TARs on all pre-1930 observations, and all post-1929
observations, for the handful of commodities with sufficient data. These results bear out our expectation that
adjustment speeds cannot be distinguished from one another, pre- and post-1929, but that estimates of trade
costs can.

9

respective figures for 1927 and 1929 are 48% and 42%, suggesting that the international
economy was slowly converging back to the levels of integration set in 1913. The evidence
from the price data is thus consistent with the recovery in world trade volumes during the
1920s apparent in Figure 1.
The cataclysm of the Great Depression and the corresponding fallout in commercial
policy changed all of this. The ratio of trade costs in 1933 to trade costs in 1913 is a
staggering 2.59—that is, trade costs as a share of destination market prices had increased by
almost 160%. Furthermore, apart from some fits and starts in re-establishing some semblance
of order to international markets, the ratio still stood at 2.68 in 1938.
Some of these patterns can be detected in Figure 3. Rather than plot all the available
series, we simply consider those trade cost series which bridge the critical period from 1929
to 1933. That is, we are able to track individual commodity trade costs from the onset of the
Great Depression to the nadir in global trade and beyond. The figure distinguishes between
series representing different orientations of trade flows. Thus, in panel A there are five trade
cost series—groundnuts from Madras to London, jute from Calcutta to London, linseed from
Bombay to London, rapeseed from Karachi to London, and rice from Burma to London—
which represent trade between the British Empire (or, more precisely, British India including
Burma) and the United Kingdom. In panel B, there are four trade cost series—cotton from
New Orleans to Liverpool, maize from Buenos Aires to London, butter from Copenhagen to
London, and linseed from Buenos Aires to London—which represent trade between nonBritish Empire countries and the United Kingdom. In panel C, there are three trade cost
series—coffee (I) from Rio de Janeiro to New York City, coffee (II) from Santos to New
York City, and maize from Buenos Aires to Rotterdam—which represent trade among nonBritish Empire countries. Finally, in panel D, there are two trade cost series from Buenos

10

Aires and Winnipeg to London, which allow us to compare the trade in wheat to the United
Kingdom from British Empire and non-British Empire countries.
Across all panels, the series again demonstrate that trade costs were on the decline
during the 1920s. There appears to have been some retrenchment in the later 1920s, but this
seems more to be a slowing in the trend than a turning point. However, 1930 witnessed a
marked transition in the trade cost series. The average for all series shot up from 0.1511 in
1929 to 0.3350 in 1933. Of the fourteen series depicted in 1933, only one — cotton from
New Orleans to Liverpool — stood at a level comparable to that of 1929 (0.1119 versus
0.1128, respectively). And even in this case, cotton trade costs increased by 70% between
1929 and 1932. The series are also roughly synchronized on the downside with most
bottoming out no later than 1935. Finally, after stabilizing at levels generally higher than in
the 1920s, the averages show no clear trend in the years immediately preceding the outbreak
of World War II.
Even more telling than these generalized trends is the differences between Empire and
non-Empire trade. For the series in Panel A, involving trade between British Empire
countries and the United Kingdom, trade costs increased on average by 62% between 1929
and 1933. For the series in Panel B, involving trade between non-British Empire countries
and the United Kingdom, trade costs increased on average by 135% between 1929 and 1933,
or almost twice as much. Among the series in Panel C, involving trade among non-British
Empire countries, trade costs increased on average by 205%. Of course, the commodity
composition of trade flows differed across these three categories, and this matters since
commercial policy responses across goods and countries is likely to have been highly
asymmetric. It is therefore instructive to turn to the series in Panel D, showing trade costs for
wheat between Argentina and the United Kingdom on the one hand, and between Canada and
the United Kingdom on the other. Again, membership in the British Empire seems to have

11

mattered: Argentine trade costs increased by 219% between 1929 and 1933, while Canadian
trade costs increased by 35% over the same period. These patterns are consistent with the re­
orientation of world trade in light of the system of imperial preferences instituted in the
Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference of 1932 (Eichengreen and Irwin, 1995).

A longer run perspective: international price gaps, 1870-1938
Some authors, such as Giovanni Federico (2008), prefer to use simpler indicators,
such as the average annual price gaps between markets, as a measure of international
commodity market integration. In this section we therefore provide this evidence for the
interwar period, and compare interwar price gaps with those pertaining in the late 19th
century, so as to gain a longer-run perspective on interwar disintegration.
Table 3 gives annual average price gaps for twenty commodity routes between 1913
and 1937. As a sensitivity check, the sample of routes presented here differs slightly from
those presented earlier: the selection criterion used here is that monthly data for the
commodity in question be provided in the IIA Yearbooks, expressed in both markets in gold
francs per quintal. Reassuringly, the same qualitative message emerges from these data as
earlier.3 First, the war directly disrupted commodity markets, and price gaps were everywhere
higher in 1922 than they had been in 1913. Second, the early to mid 1920s saw a gradual
reversion to normality, with price gaps narrowing between 1922 and 1927 for each of the
seven routes for which we have data. In some cases (the wheat trade between Britain and
North America) the net result was that 1927 price gaps were below their 1913 levels, but in
all other cases price gaps were still higher in 1927 and 1929 than they had been before the
war. Third, the years after 1929 saw further disintegration. Price gaps rose in 14 out of 19
cases between 1929 and 1933, and in 17 out of 18 cases between 1929 and 1937. For
3

Grades are identical for most of the commodities. However there are some minor discrepancies in the
grades for wheat. For example Argentinean wheat is graded as Barletta in Buenos Aries and as Plate in
Liverpool.

12

example, the New York-Rio coffee price gap rose from 9.8% in 1913 to 15.8% in 1929 and
103.6% in 1933, before declining to a still high 58.2% in 1937.
Figure 4 shows annual average price gaps for nine commodity-routes for which we
have data that are more or less comparable both before and after 1913. The data are taken
from the International Institute of Agriculture, as before, as well as from the 1919 and 1923
volumes of the Indian Department of Commercial Intelligence’s Prices and Wages in India.
For Indian cotton, jute, wheat and cottonseed, as well as for Burmese rice and US cotton and
wheat, the same route is considered for both periods, while for Indian linseed and rapeseed
the routes are different, representing different embarkation points in India (Calcutta before
1913; Bombay and Karachi for linseed and rapeseed, respectively, afterwards). Four stylised
facts emerge clearly from the figure. First, the well-known commodity market integration of
the late 19th century is confirmed. Second, the First World War saw a dramatic disintegration
of international commodity markets. The Liverpool-Bombay cotton price gap rose from 20%
in 1913 to 102% in 1917; the London-Calcutta jute price gap rose from 4.4% to 106.8%, the
rapeseed price gap rose from 14% to 140%, the wheat price gap rose from 16% to 118% and
the linseed price gap rose from 22% to 217%; the Hull-Bombay cottonseed price gap rose
from 40% to 278%; and the London-Rangoon rice price gap increased from 26% to 422%.
Third, those wartime losses were later recouped. And fourth, once this process of post-war
recuperation was over, there was no further progress towards commodity market integration,
while in the cases of rice, linseed, rapeseed, and US cotton, there was disintegration from the
late 1920s onwards, with 1929 appearing as a breakpoint. In the case of the London-Rangoon
rice trade, for example, price gaps in the 1930s were back in the 40%-50% range where they
had been in 1873. On some routes, the interwar period saw a halt to further integration; on
others, it saw a significant erosion of the progress which had been made during 1870-1913.

13

Sources of disintegration: policy or technology shocks?
One of the questions remaining is the source of this disintegration. The historical
literature strongly suggests that any changes in trade costs in the early 1930s were the result
of drastic changes in commercial policy. At the same time, the recent work of Estevadeordal,
Frantz, and Taylor (2003) suggests that there might have been some room for rising
transportation costs in explaining the interwar trade bust and, thus, the climb in estimated
trade costs.
The available evidence is ambiguous regarding what actually happened to interwar
transport costs. The interwar period saw several incremental improvements to ocean shipping
technologies, such as better boilers on steamships, or the development of turboelectric
transmission mechanisms. According to Shah Mohammed and Williamson (2004), TFP
growth in the British tramp shipping industry was as fast if not faster between 1909-11 and
1932-34 as before the war, with annual TFP growth rates of 2.83% on the transatlantic route,
1.27% on the Alexandria route, and 1.05% on the Bombay route. However, most of the
improvements had been realised by 1923-5, suggesting war-induced technological change.
Moreover, Estevadeordal et al. point out, citing Hummels (1999), that what matters for the
relative cost of shipping is its TFP growth rate relative to the economy-wide TFP growth rate
(since the latter will raise factor prices throughout the economy, and thus raise costs for
sectors experiencing below-average productivity growth).
Estevadeordal et al.’s finding that rising real maritime freight rates (from the mid­
1920s through the end of the 1930s) can help explain the interwar trade bust is based on the
Isserlis (1938) maritime freight rate index, which ends in 1936, and which they deflated by
the British consumer price index. However, there are at least two reasons why this finding
should not be accepted uncritically. The first is that the way in which Isserlis constructed his
index has been criticized, for example by Yasuba (1978) who argues that there was an

14

upward bias built into the index based on its choice of routes. The second is that if we are
concerned about the impact of freight rates on international trade, we should be deflating
them, not by a general consumer price index, but by the prices of the goods being traded.
A more recent paper, by Shah Mohammed and Williamson (2004), addresses both of
these concerns. Shah Mohammed and Williamson collect freight rates for a larger and more
representative sample of routes, and deflate by route-specific deflators, based on the prices of
the commodities being shipped on those routes. The resulting nominal and real freight rate
indices, for the period 1870-1944, are plotted in Figure 5. As can be seen, despite the wartime
improvements in transportation technology mentioned earlier, freight rates shot up after 1914,
as a result of higher wages and fuel, and more expensive ships. Transport cost increases are
thus prima facie a plausible contender in explaining the wartime disintegration of
international commodity markets documented earlier. Nominal freight rates remained higher
during the 1920s than they had been before the war, although they fell continuously, and
regained pre-war levels briefly in the early 1930s. They then increased as the 1930s
progressed, before exploding once more during World War II.4
However, it is real freight rates that matter for trade, and commodity prices were
much higher after the First World War than before. The data show real freight rates falling
through the 1920s, at levels below those experienced in 1913, so that the real freight rate
index stood at 0.58 in 1930-34, as opposed to 0.75 in 1910-14. The index then increased to
0.75 in 1935-39, although how much of this rise was due to developments in 1939 is not
clear. An immediate implication of this index is that the interwar trade bust could not have
been due to rising transport costs, since real freight rates only started rising in the mid-1930s,

after world trade volumes had started to recover.

4

This evidence is consistent with the idea that because of the endogeneity between freight rates and
trade flows the two series should be positively correlated—see Jacks and Pendakur (forthcoming) on this issue.

15

While the Shah Mohammed index represents the current state of the art, there is thus a
certain ambiguity regarding the course of international transport costs during the interwar
period. We therefore use our price data to gain some sense of whether or not the technology
of information transmission and goods shipment changed over that time. That is, with the
onset of the Great Depression, did commodity markets experience technological regression as
the world market imploded? We set a break-point in 1929 and estimate two TARs on all pre­
1930 observations and all post-1929 observations for two series: wheat between Buenos
Aires and London and wheat between Winnipeg and London. The choice of these two series
is strictly predicated on data availability.5
Estimating TAR models, as in equation 4.), for 1922 to 1929 and 1930 to 1938, we
generate the results reported in Table 4. In the upper panel, we find that trade costs in
shillings per quarter between 1922 and 1929 were 7.90 and 6.54 for the Buenos Aires and
Winnipeg routes, respectively. Combined with information on the average prices of the
specific varieties of wheat in London, this translates into proportional trade costs of 0.1574
and 0.1190, respectively—results which seem consistent with those in Table 2b above. The
speed of adjustment parameters are also fairly precisely estimated, at -0.3786 and -0.1944.
Turning to the post-1930 environment in the lower panel, we see that trade costs as a
proportion of the average London price increased to 0.2341 in the case of Argentine wheat
and 0.1698 in the case of Canadian wheat. At the same time, the speed of adjustment
parameter for Buenos Aires rose to -0.2882, while for Winnipeg it fell, to -0.2516. Thus,
trade costs as a proportion of London prices rose by roughly 50% in both instances.
5

The price data used in the previous section experienced gaps in reporting from August to December
1926, and from September to December 1932. That is, the observations for 1926 and 1932 previously presented
were estimated over the range of January to July and January to August, respectively. This does not present a
problem for estimation in a given year as the only data requirement for the TAR procedure is that the price data
is evenly spaced (in this case, weekly) and continuous. However, when estimating over the entire period 1922 to
1929, or 1930 to 1938, the data need to be augmented so as to fill those gaps with observations from the latter
halves of 1926 and 1932. Fortunately, the Food Research Institute’s Wheat Studies provides a wealth of data not
only on consumption, production, and transactions worldwide, but also on trends in wheat prices in international
markets. Combining the two sources, we have continuous weekly time series for these two wheat markets from
January 1922 to December 1938.

16

Moreover, the difference is statistically significant across periods. By contrast, while the
speed of adjustment parameters do change across regimes, they do so in an inconsistent
manner, and the differences are not statistically significant. We take this as prima facie
evidence that the communication and transportation technology surrounding trade did not
change in this period, but that policy and other barriers to trade almost certainly did.
Is there any other evidence from these particular markets which might guide us on this
point? Luckily, the Wheat Studies publication also provides some limited information on
prevailing freight rates linking prominent markets in the worldwide wheat trade. In this
instance, we are limited to considering the case of the wheat trade between Winnipeg and
London. Figure 6 depicts the ratio of the estimated trade costs to the London price, and the
ratio of quoted freight rates to the London price. Both ratios start in 1922 at or near their pre­
war levels of 0.2351 and 0.0787, respectively. As in Table 2b, the trade cost to destination
price ratio falls rapidly in the early 1920s, but then remains rather steady up to 1929, when it
was 0.1382. From 1929, the trade cost series explodes, reaching a peak in 1932 of 0.2977,
and then quickly recedes by the mid-1930s. In contrast, the ratio of freight rates to the
destination price declines continuously through the 1920s with an inflection point being
reached in 1929. However, the ratio never rises above 0.1000 and is not marked by the
dramatic spike surrounding the onset of the Great Depression found in the trade cost series.
Thus, we are left with the proposition that the spikes in the proportionate trade cost series
depicted in Figure 3 must have been driven by other processes. Again, the historical literature
leads us to believe that commercial policy is a very likely contender. However, future work
should also consider the collapse of the gold standard, as well as the likely evaporation of
commercial credit in the wake of the Great Depression.

3. Conclusion

This paper has documented a dramatic wartime disintegration of international
commodity markets; a gradual reintegration during the 1920s; and yet another phase of
disintegration from 1929 onwards. The post-1929 disintegration was not due to increasing
freight costs, unlike the disintegration of the wartime years, and protectionism seems the
most likely alternative candidate. On the other hand, an increasing scarcity of trade finance,
similar to what is happening today, may also have been playing a role. Another possibility,
suggested by Estevadeordal, Frantz, and Taylor (2003), is that the increase in transaction
frictions associated with the collapse of the interwar gold standard may have increased trade
costs. On the other hand, the net impact of abandoning gold on trade remains to be seen,
given that, as Irwin (1993) points out, countries which maintained monetary orthodoxy were
more likely to impose quantitative restrictions on trade than those which abandoned gold.
On balance, this paper provides evidence in favour of the view that interwar
protectionism led to a severe disintegration of international commodity markets. Our hope is
that it will stimulate others to undertake the kind of work which has been extensively
undertaken for the pre-1913 period, so that we will ultimately arrive at a fuller understanding
both of 20th century trends in international integration, and of the causes of the spectacular
decline in world trade which occurred after 1929.

Table 3. Average annual commodity price gaps, 1913-1937 (percent)

Source: International Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics, International Institute of
Agriculture, various years. Data for 1927-37 are based on annual averages of monthly price
data, expressed in gold francs per quintal. There are two exceptions: such monthly price data
are only available for Liverpool-Chicago wheat prices for 1927-32; and for London-Buenos
Aires oats prices for 1927-33. Where monthly data in gold francs per quintal are not
available, price gaps are calculated based on the weekly price data used elsewhere in this
paper.

Figure 4. Percentage price gaps, 1870-1938.

Sources: data on Anglo-Indian price gaps, 1873-1921, are computed based on the price
information in the 1919 and 1923 volumes of Prices and Wages in India. Data for 1927-1938
are based on International Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics, International Institute of
Agriculture, various years. Data on the Liverpool-New Orleans cotton price gap are based on
the price information in the International Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics. Weekly
information is used for 1912-26; monthly data in gold francs per quintal are used for 1927­
1938. Data on the Liverpool-Chicago wheat price gap are based on the price information for
#2 winter wheat given in Harley (1980) for 1870-1913, and in International Yearbook of
Agricultural Statistics for 1913-1932. Harley gives prices for #2 winter wheat in Liverpool
for every year between 1870 and 1913, but Chicago information is only available for 1872,
1875, and 1879-1891. For the other years, we use his price data for #2 spring wheat in
Chicago, adjusted up slightly to correct for the average price gap between the two grades of
wheat in Chicago experienced between 1879 and 1891.
