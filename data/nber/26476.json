    "abstract": "\n\nHoynes, Miller and Simon (2015), henceforth HMS, report that the national expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is associated with decreases in low birth weight.  We question their findings.  HMS\u2019s difference-in-differences estimates are unidentified in some comparisons, while failed placebo tests undermine others.  Their effects lack a plausible mechanism as the association between the EITC and prenatal smoking also fails placebo tests. We contend that the waning of the crack epidemic is a possible confound, but we show that any number of policies directed at poor women also eliminate the effect of the EITC when aggregated to the national level.  Identifying small, causal effects of a national policy at a single point in time is exceedingly challenging.\n\nThis paper was motivated by an earlier NBER working paper. The authors of that paper have posted a response to this paper.\n\n",
