It is widely believed that exchange rate changes have important implications for financial
decision-making and for firm profitability. But do exchange rate changes have measurable
effects on firm returns? The existing literature on the relationship between international stock
prices and exchange rates finds only weak evidence of systematic exchange rate exposure. We
argue in this paper that the absence of evidence may be due to restrictions imposed on empirical
specifications used in previous studies.
We adopt a data-driven approach to measuring exposure and study a relatively broad
sample of countries over an eighteen-year period. The results indicate that there is considerable
exchange rate exposure at both the industry and firm level.
I. Defining Exchange Rate Exposure
A firm is said to exhibit exchange rate exposure if its share value is influenced by
changes in currency values (Michael Adler and Bernard Dumas (1984)). There are a number of
channels through which the exchange rate might affect the profitability of a firm. Firms that
export to foreign markets may benefit from a depreciation of the local currency if its products
become more affordable to foreign consumers. On the other hand, firms that rely on imported
intermediate products may see their profits shrink as a consequence of increasing costs of
production. Even firms that do no international business may be influenced indirectly by foreign
competition. Furthermore, firms in the nontraded as well as the traded sectors of the economy
compete for factors of production, whose returns may be affected by changes in the exchange
rate.
Although there are many explanations for the link between the exchange rate and
profitability, the link between the exchange rate and a firm’s stock price is less clear. Under the
CAPM, the expected risk premium on a company's share price is proportional to its covariance

1

with the market portfolio. In theory, investors will only require a return on the non-diversifiable
portion of firm risk and no variable other than the market return should play a systematic role in
determining asset returns. Therefore, a test for exchange rate exposure involves including the
change in the exchange rate on the right-hand-side of a standard CAPM regression and testing
whether its coefficient is significantly different than zero:
Ri,t = β 0,i + β 1,i Rm, t + β 2, i ∆st + ε i, t

(1)

where Ri ,t is the return on firm i at time t, Rm,t is the return on the market portfolio, β1,i is the firm’s
beta, ∆st is the change in the relevant exchange rate and β 2,i measures a firm’s exposure to
exchange rate movements after taking into account the overall market’s exposure to currency
fluctuations. If β 2,i is zero, this implies that firm i has the same exchange rate exposure as the
market portfolio (not necessarily that the firm has no exposure). Alternatively, if we reject the
hypothesis that β 2,i is, on average, zero – we both find evidence of exchange rate exposure and a
rejection of this specification of the CAPM.1
If we do indeed find evidence of exchange rate exposure, this indicates the existence of
some form of market inefficiency. A rejection of no exposure suggests either that investors are not
fully diversifying their portfolios – so that exchange rate risk remains – or that firms themselves
are not fully hedging their exchange rate risks. Unfortunately, without more detailed data either on
investor portfolio holdings or firms' hedging practices, it is not possible to say which of these
situations is operative.

1

It is possible, even likely, that in some countries the exchange rate and the market return are jointly
determined. Our definition of exposure will therefore understate the overall impact of a change in the
exchange rate on firm returns.

2

II. Testing for Exposure
Testing for exchange rate exposure at the firm and industry level entails taking a stand on
a number of empirical questions.
A. Exchange Rates
One of the first questions that arises when thinking about exchange rate exposure is
"Which is the relevant exchange rate to include in equation 1?" Most of the studies in the
literature use a trade-weighted exchange rate to measure exposure. The problem with using a
trade-weighted basket of currencies in exposure tests is that the results lack power if the nature of
firm exposure does not correspond to the exchange rates (and the relative weights) included in
the basket. More generally, we should expect variation in individual firm and industry exposure
to various exchange rates. Any test that restricts the measurement of exposure to one exchange
rate (whether it be a trade-weighted rate or a bilateral rate) is likely to biased downward.2
One possible research strategy to mitigate this problem is to create firm and industry
specific exchange rates. The difficulty with this approach is that it is not clear on what basis
these exchange rates should be chosen. Firms may hedge exposure to the more obvious
currencies (for example, currencies of the countries where they export or import goods), but
remain exposed to currencies of countries with whom their goods compete on world markets (but
with whom they do no direct business). Since theory does not provide us with clear exchange
rate candidates for our exposure tests we include multiple exchange rates in our specifications.

2

Craig Doidge, John Griffin and Rohan Williamson (2000) use both bilateral rates and trade-weighted
exchange rates but “score” exposure based on one rate.

3

B. Industry Aggregation
The majority of exposure studies use industry level data. They do so for two reasons.
First, some hypotheses about exposure are most relevant at the industry level. For example, one
prediction is that exposure will be greatest in highly competitive industries where mark-ups are
low.3 The second reason is that cross-country industry-return data are relatively easy to obtain.
The problem with industry level aggregation is that firms within an industry need not be
homogeneous. It may be that industry-wide exposure is actually high but that individual firms
within the industry are exposed in opposite ways. An aggregation of their returns will therefore
average out the individual exposure effects. Moreover, most industry return indices (including
the widely used Datastream indices) are value weighted so that the largest firms in the industry
are given the greatest weight in the index. We therefore test for exposure at both the industry and
the firm level.
C. Multinationals and Exporting Firms
Another common empirical strategy is to test for exposure in a limited set of firms. For
example, a number of studies test for exposure in multinational firms, or in firms that actively
engage in international trade.4 However, theory does not suggest that exposure will be limited to
these firms. Indeed, one might expect that these firms would be the least likely to be exposed
since they are the most likely to have access to both operational and financial hedging strategies.5
In order to allow the data to inform us about which firms are more or less likely to be exposed
we include all firms in our empirical work.
3

For example, Gordon Bodnar and William Gentry (1993) and Jose Campa and Linda Goldberg (1995).

4

For example, Philippe Jorion (1990) and Jia He and Lilian Ng (1998). Dominguez and Tesar (2000)
test whether firms in industries that are involved in international trade are more likely to be exposed.
5

Examples of operational hedges include locating production abroad and matching the currency of
invoice for both receipts and outlays.

4

D. Equally Weighted versus Value Weighted Market Returns
Empirical tests of the standard CAPM model generally include a country specific valueweighted market return to proxy for “the market”. In a world of perfectly integrated capital
markets the “market return” is best proxied by a global portfolio. But, previous empirical work
strongly suggests that country specific market returns better explain firm and industry level
returns.6 Further, Gordon Bodnar and Franco Wong (2000) explain that value-weighted market
returns are dominated by large firms that are more likely to be multinational and/or export
oriented and are more likely to experience negative cash flow reactions to home currency
appreciations than other firms. Therefore, including the value-weighted market return in an
exposure test not only removes the standard macroeconomic effects, but also the more negative
cash flow effects of larger firms. This would likely bias tests toward finding no exposure. In the
tests results reported below we use an equal-weighted market return.
E. Exposure Stability
The exposure tests are estimated using data covering the period January 1980- May 1999.
In order to test whether the results are robust over subsamples – and whether specific subsamples
drive the full sample results - we re-estimate both firm and industry level tests over three
subperiods. Subperiods are selected on the basis of changes in the underlying currencies used for
each country.

6

In future work we will systematically explore the impact of different CAPM specifications on our
estimates of exposure.

5

III. The Empirical Specification, the Data and Results
Augmented CAPM specifications are estimated at the firm and four-digit industry level
for eight countries (Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Thailand and the UK)
using a broad sample of firms. We use weekly (Wednesday) returns, country-specific market
portfolio returns, and three country specific exchange rates. All data are from Datastream. For
large countries (Germany, Japan and the UK) we selected a representative sample of firms (25%
of the population) based on market capitalization and industry affiliation. For the remaining
countries we include the population of firms. The samples include an average of 300 firms for
each country; Japan includes the largest number of firms at 488; Chile has the smallest number at
199. Firms with fewer than six months of data over the period 1980 to 1999 were excluded from
the sample. The number of industries varied across countries from 20 in Thailand to 39 in the
UK.
Table 1 shows the percentages of industries and firms within a country with significant
exposure at the 5% level (based on robust standard errors). The extent of exchange rate exposure
is remarkably high and clearly above the ratios one would expect to see in a random sample. The
“any” exchange rate column shows that firm level exposure ranges from a low of 19% for Chile
to a high of 31% for Japan. At the industry level, Germany and Japan show greater than 60%
exposure and the rest of the countries show between 22-46% exposure.
The results indicate that tests based on the trade-weighted exchange rate are likely to
yield downward biased estimates of exposure. For example, 24% of the Japanese sample
consists of firms that are not exposed to the trade-weighted exchange rate but are significantly
exposed to one of the included bilateral rates.

Notes: The columns labeled "TW" show the percent (industries or firms) exposed to a tradeweighted exchange rate; "any" show the percent exposed to at least one of the following: the
TW, the US dollar and an additional bilateral rate (based on direction of trade data). The final
column shows the percent of firms that are exposed to a bilateral rate, but are not exposed to the
TW exchange rate.

The augmented CAPM regressions also provide information on the percentage of
significant positive and negative exposure (see Kathryn M. Dominguez and Linda L. Tesar
2000). In three of the countries (Chile, Germany and Italy) positive and negative exposure is
about evenly split. In another four countries (France, Japan, the Netherlands and the UK) 6070% of firms exhibit positive exposure (meaning that an increase in the value of the home
currency relative to other currencies results in an increase in firm share value). In contrast, 80%
of Thai firms exhibit negative exposure, suggesting that an increase in the value of the baht
generally led to a decrease in the value of Thai firm share values.
We also calculate the average increase in the adjusted R2 when we include the exchange
rate in a traditional CAPM specification. Although the smaller countries like Chile and Thailand
show relatively lower levels of industry and firm exposure, the average increase in adjusted R2
from including an exchange rate in the CAPM specification for these countries is relatively high.
This suggests that although fewer firms in these countries are exposed, those that are exposed

7

have a relatively high degree of exposure. This phenomenon also shows up in the average size
of the exposure coefficient.
Finally, we test whether the exposure estimates obtained for the full sample of eighteen
years are robust over subsamples. While there is time-variation in exposure at the firm level, the
overall extent of exposure is not sample dependent. A complete discussion of the subsample
results is presented in Dominguez and Tesar (2000).
IV. Conclusions
This study uses a broad sample of firm and industry returns, equal-weighted market
returns, and multiple exchange rates to test for exchange rate exposure. The results are consistent
with high degrees of exchange rate exposure at both the firm and industry level across eight
countries. In future research we will examine what kinds of country, firm and industry
characteristics best predict exposure.
