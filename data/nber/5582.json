    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents five theoretical openness-and-growth links that can account for trade-induced investment-led growth.  The links are all demonstrated with neoclassical growth models developed in the context of trade models that allow for imperfect competition and scale economies.  This sort of old-growth-theory-in-a-new-trade-model has not been thoroughly explored in the literature since the profession skipped from old-growth-old-trade models straight to new-growth-new- trade models.  Nonetheless, such models are necessary to explain several key aspects of the econometric evidence on trade and growth. For example, cross-country data suggests that openness influences growth only via its effect on investment, and suggests that openness promotes investment in all countries whatever the capital-intensive of their exports (contrary to predictions of the old-growth-old-trade models).\n\n",
