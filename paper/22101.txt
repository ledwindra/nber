Management Practices, Workforce Selection and Productivity

ABSTRACT
Recent research suggests that much of the cross-firm variation in measured productivity is due to
differences in use of advanced management practices. Many of these practices – including
monitoring, goal setting, and the use of incentives – are mediated through employee decisionmaking and effort. To the extent that these practices are complementary with workers’ skills,
better-managed firms will tend to recruit higher-ability workers and adopt pay practices to retain
these employees. We use a unique data set that combines detailed survey data on the management
practices of German manufacturing firms with longitudinal earnings records for their employees
to study the relationship between productivity, management, worker ability, and pay. As
documented by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) there is a strong partial correlation between
management practice scores and firm-level productivity in Germany. In our preferred TFP
estimates only a small fraction of this correlation is explained by the higher human capital of the
average employee at better-managed firms. A larger share (about 13%) is attributable to the
human capital of the highest-paid workers, a group we interpret as representing the managers of
the firm. And a similar amount is mediated through the pay premiums offered by better-managed
firms. Looking at employee inflows and outflows, we confirm that better-managed firms
systematically recruit and retain workers with higher average human capital. Overall, we
conclude that workforce selection and positive pay premiums explain just under 30% of the
measured impact of management practices on productivity in German manufacturing.

INTRODUCTION

In a typical four-digit manufacturing industry in the U.S., plants at the 90th percentile of total factor
productivity (TFP) are about twice as productive as those at the 10th percentile (Syverson, 2004, 2011).
These very large differences in between-firm productivity are highly persistent, contributing to
significant disparities in economic performance over time and across countries.1 They are also central to
a growing body of theoretical research in macroeconomics, industrial organization, and trade. In labor
economics, much empirical and theoretical work finds a strong connection between firm performance
and average wages, which suggests firm productivity could help explain cross sectional wage inequality.
Furthermore, many recent papers attribute a significant fraction of the growth in wage inequality across
individuals to growing differences between establishments.2 Since wage differences between firms are
closely correlated with performance differences, understanding what drives the dispersion in
establishment performance could help us understand why inequality has risen so sharply in recent
decades.
As suggested by the seminal work of Ichniowski, Shaw and Prennushi (1997) a key correlate of plantlevel productivity is the adoption of advanced management practices, including employee monitoring,
financial incentives, and modern inventory control and work-flow techniques. Bloom, Sadun and Van
Reenen (2015) argue that about half of the difference in average TFP between plants in the U.S. and
Southern EU countries is explained by an index of advanced practices that they interpret as “management
capital”. At the very micro level, Bloom et al (2013) find a large causal role for management practices
in a field experiment with Indian textile plants.
While some management practices can directly impact productivity, many others – like monitoring, goal
setting, and use of incentives – are mediated through employee decision-making and effort. If advanced
management practices are complementary with higher-ability employees, as seems plausible, then one
would expect firms that use these practices to systematically alter both the skill composition of their
workforce and the structure of their pay system.3

For example, Bailey, Hulten and Campbell (1992); Hsieh and Klenow (2009); Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta
(2013).

In this paper we formally investigate the extent to which management – as proxied by an index of
adoption of advanced management practices - affects measured productivity through the channels of
workforce selection and pay. Our empirical analysis exploits a unique database of middle-sized German
manufacturing plants included in the WMS (the World Management Survey, discussed by Bloom and
Van Reenen, 2007 and Bloom et al., 2014), linked to employee earnings records from the Integrated
Employment Biographies (IEB) of the Institute for Employment Research. The WMS provides detailed
survey data on management practices and, through links to the ORBIS database, firm-level financial
information. The IEB provides longitudinal data on earnings of workers who were employed at these
plants, including their pay at previous or subsequent employers, which we use to estimate a personspecific measure of earnings capacity for each worker, and plant-specific pay premiums for each
workplace. The worker effects allow us to measure the quality of workers’ skills at each plant as well as
the relative quality of different employee subgroups. The pay premiums provide a summary measure of
the financial incentive system at each plant.
Analyzing these data through the lens of a simple model of firm-specific productivity, we reach three
main conclusions. First, plants with higher management scores have higher average worker skills. Plantspecific measures of observed skills (e.g., the fraction of workers with a college degree) and of overall
skills (as recovered from the person effects in a two-way fixed effects model) have a strong correlation
with measured productivity. Nevertheless, only a limited fraction of the overall impact of management
practices is mediated through average worker skills. A more important channel is though the skills of
the top quartile of employees at a plant – a group that we interpret as the managers of the plant. Higher
average skill for this group has an independent influence on plant-level productivity (controlling for
average worker skills at the plant) and is positively correlated with higher management practice scores.
Overall about one-sixth of the productivity effect of higher management practices is mediated through
the average skill level of manager.
A second finding is that plants with higher management scores pay higher wages relative to the market
as a whole, controlling for the quality of their workforce. Higher pay premiums account for another 13
percent of the measured net productivity effect of better management practices. Some of this could
reflect longer hours or higher levels of performance pay at well managed firms, features we cannot
directly observe.
A third finding is that better managed firms are able to build up a superior stock of employees through
selective hiring and attrition. In particular, examining job inflows and outflows at the plants in our
2

sample, we find that those with higher management scores are more likely to recruit higher ability
workers (measured by the permanent component in their earnings) and are less likely to lay off or fire
the highest skilled workers in the period between 2004 and 2009.
Our paper contributes to many existing literatures. First, as noted above we contribute to the growing
literature on firm heterogeneity and economic performance (e.g. de Loecker and Goldberg, 2014).
Second, we try to understand the causes of the heterogeneity in management practices and the link to
workers’ skills (e.g. Feng and Valero, 2015; Lemos and Scur, 2015). Third, we link to work on corporate
culture by economists and management scholars (e.g. Guiso et al, 2013, 2015; O’Reilly, 1989). Finally,
we contribute to the literature on the importance of managers for firm performance (e.g. Bertrand and
Schoar, 2003; Bennedsen et al, 2007).
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II describes are empirical framework, Section III the
data and Section IV the results. Some concluding comments are offered in Section V. The Online
Appendices contain more details about the data and many additional specifications and robustness
checks.
II.

EMPIRICAL MODELS

a. Conceptual Framework
The classical approach to understanding productivity differences across firms or plants is “reductionist”:
after properly accounting for differences in capital and other non-labor inputs per worker, any remaining
difference in productivity at a given point in time is by definition a measure of the quality of the
workforce.4 Lucas (1978) offers a more sophisticated version of this approach that accounts for firm
heterogeneity. In his span of control model, the talent of the CEO determines the productivity of the
firm. More talented CEOs run larger (or more complex) firms, so the relationship between management
and productivity boils down to the human capital of the CEO.
Although the Lucas (1978) model is powerful and parsimonious, we view the focus on the CEO as overly
narrow. For example, many iconic firms such as Toyota, GE, IBM and Lincoln Electric remain
successful even after their CEO dies and/or all the original managers have left the firm. Management
scholars refer to this as firm “capability” or “corporate culture”. Building on this framework, we view
the quality of the workforce, the pay strategy of the firm, and the adoption of advanced management
Comparisons of productivity over time are also affected by differences in technology. See Jorgenson (1991) for a brief
history of productivity measurement and growth accounting.

practices as jointly endogenous choices that reflect the underlying quality of management of the firm.
We ask to what extent the measured productivity effects of advanced management practices reflect the
impact of higher human capital of all employees at firms that adopt these practices, or the higher human
capital of the managers.
As a framework for our empirical analysis we adopt a standard production function approach that
incorporates variation across firms in both total factor productivity and the quality of labor. Specifically,
suppose that value of the output of firm j in period t, 𝑌𝑗𝑡 , depends on inputs of non-management labor
𝑁𝑗𝑡 , management labor 𝑀𝑗𝑡 , intermediate inputs 𝐼𝑗𝑡 , and capital 𝐾𝑗𝑡 , through a constant returns to scale
production function:
𝑌𝑗𝑡 = 𝜃𝑗𝑡 𝑓(𝑄𝑁𝑗𝑡 𝑁𝑗𝑡 , 𝑄𝑀𝑗𝑡 𝑀𝑗𝑡 , 𝐼𝑗𝑡 , 𝐾𝑗𝑡 ) ,

(1)

where 𝜃𝑗𝑡 represents total factor productivity (TFP) in period t, and 𝑄𝑀𝑗𝑡 and 𝑄𝑁𝑗𝑡 are the productivity
levels of non-management workers and managers at the firm. We think of better-managed firms as
potentially selecting different types of managers and non-management workers and offering different
incentive packages – both of which could raise 𝑄𝑀𝑗𝑡 and 𝑄𝑁𝑗𝑡 . We also think of these firms as adopting
practices and management systems that directly increase 𝜃𝑗𝑡 .
Using a first order approximation of the function f(.) and the assumption that marginal products of the
four inputs are equal to their factor prices, the log of output can be expressed as:
log 𝑌𝑗𝑡 = 𝑠0 + 𝑠𝑁 log 𝑁𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝑀 log 𝑀𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐼 log 𝐼𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐾 log 𝐾𝑗𝑡
(2)

+ 𝑠𝑁 log 𝑄𝑁𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝑀 log 𝑄𝑀𝑗𝑡 + log 𝜃𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑗𝑡

where 𝑠0 is a constant, 𝑠𝑁 , 𝑠𝑀 , 𝑠𝐼 , and 𝑠𝐾 are the cost shares of non-management labor, management
labor, intermediate inputs, and capital, respectively, and 𝜖𝑗𝑡 is an approximation error.5 If the
employment share of managers in the workforce is approximately constant across firms (as we implicitly
assume in our empirical analysis below) this expression can be usefully simplified. Letting 𝐿𝑗𝑡 = 𝑁𝑗𝑡 +
𝑀𝑗𝑡 represent total employment and 𝑠𝐿 =𝑠𝑀 +𝑠𝑁 represent the cost share of labor inputs, and defining 𝑄𝑗𝑡
as the geometric average of the productivity levels of managers and non-managers:
1/𝑆𝐿

𝑄𝑗𝑡 ≡ [(𝑄𝑁𝑗𝑡 )𝑆𝑁 (𝑄𝑀𝑗𝑡 )𝑆𝑀 ]

,

(3)

equation (2) can be rewritten as:
log 𝑌𝑗𝑡 = 𝑠′0 + 𝑠𝐿 log 𝐿𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐼 log 𝐼𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐾 log 𝐾𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐿 log 𝑄𝑗𝑡 + log 𝜃𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑗𝑡 ,

(2’)

Note that the s coefficients in this equation (including both the constant and the factor shares) potentially vary with
characteristics of the firm such as industry and size. In our models below we control for many observed characteristics in
recognition of this fact.
5

where 𝑠′0 = 𝑠0 + 𝑠𝑁 log(1 − 𝑚) + 𝑠𝑀 log 𝑚, and m is the employment share of managers. Notice that
(to first order) the appropriately defined average quality measure 𝑄𝑗𝑡 fully captures variation in the
relative productivity of both management and non-management labor inputs.
b. Management and Productivity
To assess the effects of workforce quality on firm productivity we need to measure the skill composition
of the workforce. The standard approach to measuring labor quality, pioneered by Dennison (1962), is
to classify workers into subgroups based on observed characteristics (e.g., by white collar/blue collar
status or education) and control for the shares of workers in each group. A limitation of this approach
is that observed characteristics explain only a small share of the variation in wages across workers or
firms, suggesting that there may be a lot of unobserved heterogeneity in the productivity of the workers
at different firms. Moreover, the standard approach cannot address the possible impact of wage-based
incentives on the productivity of labor.
As an alternative, we build on the simple framework developed by Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1996,
henceforth “AKM”), which decomposes wages into worker- and establishment-specific pay
components. Specifically, AKM assume that the log of the wage received by worker i in period t can be
decomposed as:
log 𝑤𝑖𝑡 = 𝜂𝑖 + 𝜓𝑱(𝑖,𝑡) + 𝑥′𝑖𝑡 𝛽 + 𝑟𝑖𝑡 ,

(4)

where 𝜂𝑖 is an individual-specific pay component, 𝑥′𝑖𝑡 𝛽 is a linear index of time varying individual
characteristics (incorporating the effects of experience and calendar time) 6, J(i,t) is an index function
that gives the identity of the workplace of individual i in period t , 𝜓𝑗 is a time-invariant wage premium
paid to all workers at workplace j, and 𝑟𝑖𝑡 is a residual pay component. In this model, 𝜂𝑖 can be
interpreted as a measure of worker i’s human capital, incorporating potentially observable factors (like
education) as well as unobserved attributes like cognitive ability or ambition that raise or lower the
worker’s productivity regardless of where they work. The pay premium 𝜓𝑗 can be interpreted as a
measure of the financial incentives associated with continued employment at the firm. AKM show that
under a set of orthogonality assumptions the worker-specific and plant-specific pay components in
equation (4) can be estimated without bias using ordinary least squares.7

We normalize the index 𝑥′𝑖𝑡 𝛽 to be equal to 0 for individuals of age 40, so 𝜂𝑖 measures the permanent individual component
of wages at the roughly the peak of the lifecycle wage profile.
7
The most controversial implication of these assumptions is that the residual component of wages is uncorrelated with the
entire sequence of firm identifiers in a worker’s job history. As discussed by CHK, this rules out mobility based on a “matchspecific” component of pay.
6

5

Card, Heining and Kline (2013) (CHK) show that the AKM model provides a relatively good
approximation to the structure of wages in Germany, with 𝑅̅ 2 statistics of around 90 percent. They also
show that more- and less-skilled workers receive approximately the same proportional wage premiums
at a given establishment – consistent with the simple additive structure of equation (4). Moreover, they
argue that the assumptions needed for unbiased estimation of the worker and establishment effects in the
AKM model appear to be roughly satisfied in Germany. In particular, the “match-specific” component
of the wage residual 𝑟𝑖𝑡 is small in magnitude and uncorrelated with the direction of mobility between
firms. Given these findings, and the fact that we use the same IEB wage data in our analysis, we use the
worker and establishment effects estimated by CHK to summarize different workers’ abilities and the
strength of the financial incentives offered at different workplaces. 8
Specifically, we use the average of the estimated worker effects for full time employees at a given
establishment (𝜂̂ ̅ 𝑗 ) as a simple proxy for the average human capital of workers at the plant, and the
estimated wage premium for full time male workers at the establishment 𝜓̂𝑗 as a proxy for the size of
the financial incentives offered by firm. 9 We assume that the average productivity of labor inputs at the
firm is affected by both factors, as well as by the adoption of advanced management practices (indexed
by a measure Λ 𝑗 ):
log 𝑄𝑗𝑡 = 𝜌0 + 𝜌1 𝜂̂ ̅ 𝑗 + 𝜌2 𝜓̂𝑗 + 𝜌3 Λ 𝑗 + 𝜐𝑗𝑡 .

(5)

Given the scaling of the person effects in equation (4) one might expect that 𝜌1 ≈ 1. Since these effects
are measured with error, however, and are unavailable for part-time workers and trainees, we expect
some attenuation in the estimated value of 𝜌1 .10 The magnitude of the coefficient 𝜌2 is less clear. If a
firm that pays a 10% higher wage premium is rewarded with 10% higher productivity, then 𝜌2 = 1. If,
on the other hand, higher or lower wage premiums have no effect on productivity then 𝜌2 = 0.

Despite the apparent empirical success of the AKM framework, we note that the estimated firm effects are at best a crude
summary of the pay policy of a given firm. Moreover, the estimation issues may be more difficult for certain types of firms
– e.g., those that are undergoing a management turnaround during the sample period.
9
Since the IEB data do not include information on hours, CHK limit their estimated models to full time workers. Over 90%
of West German males are full time so this is not too restrictive. Among women, however, close to a third work part time.
As a result of this fact (and the lower participation rate of females), the sample sizes underlying the CHK estimates are about
80% larger for men than women, leading to less measurement error in the male effects. For simplicity, we therefore use the
establishment wage premiums for men.
10
CHK estimate the AKM model using data for full-time workers between the ages of 20 and 60, so our average person
effect estimates exclude part-time workers, trainees, workers in so-called “mini-jobs”, and those under 20 or over 60.
8

6

As suggested by Lucas (1978) TFP may be affected by the ability of the managers at a firm, as well as
by the firm’s adoption of advanced management practices. We assume that
log 𝜃𝑗𝑡 = 𝜆0 + 𝜆1 𝜂̂ ̅𝑀𝑗 + 𝜆2 Λ 𝑗 + 𝜑𝑗𝑡 ,

(6)

where 𝜂̂ ̅𝑀𝑗 is the mean value of the estimated person effects for the highest-paid workers at the firm,
who we assume represent the managers of the firm. Combining equations (2’), (5) and (6) leads to the
following model for output:
log 𝑌𝑗𝑡 = 𝑠 ′′ 0 + 𝑠𝐿 log 𝐿𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐼 log 𝐼𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐾 log 𝐾𝑗𝑡
+ 𝜋1 𝜂̂ ̅𝑗 + 𝜋2 𝜓̂𝑗 + 𝜋3 𝜂̂ ̅𝑀𝑗 + 𝜋4 Λ 𝑗 + 𝜖′𝑗𝑡

(7)

where 𝜋1 = 𝑠𝐿 𝜌1 , 𝜋2 = 𝑠𝐿 𝜌2 , 𝜋3 = 𝜆1 , 𝜋4 = 𝑠𝐿 𝜌3 + 𝜆2 , and 𝜖′𝑗𝑡 = 𝜖𝑗𝑡 + 𝑠𝐿 𝜐𝑗𝑡 + 𝜑𝑗𝑡 . Equation (7) is
a standard log-linear 3-factor production function, augmented with four additional productivity factors:
(1) a measure of the average quality of the plant’s workforce; (2) a measure of the average wage premium
received by workers at the firm; (3) a measure of the average quality of managers at the firm; and (4) a
measure of the use of advanced management practices.
Since the factor inputs are endogenous, we also estimate a log-TFP specification where we bring labor,
capital and intermediate inputs to the left hand side of the equation:
log 𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑗𝑡 ≡ log 𝑌𝑗𝑡 − 𝑠𝐿 log 𝐿𝑗𝑡 − 𝑠𝐼 log 𝐼𝑗𝑡 − 𝑠𝐾 log 𝐾𝑗𝑡
= 𝑠 ′′ 0 + 𝜋1 𝜂̂ ̅𝑗 + 𝜋2 𝜓̂𝑗 + 𝜋3 𝜂̂ ̅ 𝑀𝑗 + 𝜋4 Λ 𝑗 + 𝜖′𝑗𝑡

(8)

In our empirical analysis below we compare estimates of equations (7) and (8) to estimates of similar
“reduced form” specifications that excludes the labor quality and wage premium measures and include
only the management practices variable. If advanced management practices, higher workforce quality,
and enhanced pay are complementary practices that tend to be adopted as a package by better-managed
firms, then we expect the measured impact of advanced management practices to be larger in this
alternative specification, reflecting an “omitted variable” bias. We also consider controlling for other
factors that may influence productivity and workforce quality in equations (7) and (8) such as firm age,
industry, ownership type, the degree of product market competition, etc.
In addition to examining how the productivity-management relationship changes after conditioning on
worker ability and the firm-specific pay premium, we also examine directly the cross-firm relationship
between the ability distribution and management scores. We first check whether firms with high
management scores employ people of above average ability, especially in the upper quartile of the
within-firm pay distribution. We then investigate the extent to which the positive correlation between
management practices and the average ability of the workforce is due to selective recruiting and retention
7

of higher-ability workers by better-managed firms. We tackle this question by analyzing leavers and
joiners at the firms in our data base between 2004 and 2009 (the dates when the management survey
took place). Using estimates of worker ability based on data from the pre-2003 period we ask whether
the better managed firms disproportionately recruit and retain those of higher ability.
III.

DATA

Our empirical analysis combines data for the German firms in the World Management Management
Survey (Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007; Bloom al, 2014) with longitudinal earnings records from the
Institute for Employment Research (Dorner et al., 2010). In this section we briefly describe the two
underlying data sets and our procedure for forming the matched WMS-IEB data base.
a. The WMS Data Base
The WMS was developed by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) as an instrument for eliciting reliable
information on the use of advanced management practices. The WMS relies on an interview-based
evaluation tool that scores participating firms from one (“worst practice”) to five (“best practice”) in
three broad areas.11 The first is monitoring: how well does the firm track what goes on inside its plant(s)
and use this for continuous improvement? The second is goal setting: does the firm set appropriate
targets, track closely aligned outcomes, and take appropriate action if the two are inconsistent? A third
area is incentives/people management: does the firm promote and reward employees based on
performance, and systematically try to hire and retain the best employees? 12
To obtain accurate responses the WMS uses a ‘double-blind’ protocol. Responding plant managers are
not informed that they are being scored, or shown the scoring grid. They are only told that they are being
“interviewed about management practices for a piece of work”. Likewise, WMS interviewers are not
given any information about the firm.
The interview script consists of open-ended questions rather than yes/no queries or checklists. For
example, the first question on monitoring practices is “Tell me how you monitor your production
process.” The questions continue, focusing on actual practices and examples, until the interviewer can

The survey tool used in the WMS was developed by an international management consulting company. Not all aspects of
management behavior are captured by the WMS. For example, Bertrand and Schoar (2003) focus on CEO and CFO
management style, capturing (for example) differences in strategy over mergers and acquisitions.
12
These practices are similar to those emphasized in earlier work on management practices, by for example Ichniowski,
Prennushi and Shaw (1997) and Black and Lynch (2001).

make an accurate assessment of the firm’s practices in a certain area. The full interview script is reported
in Appendix Table B1.
The survey universe for the German component of the WMS consists of medium-sized manufacturing
firms (employing between 50 and 5,000 workers) selected from the ORBIS data base. Firms with under
50 workers were excluded from the universe because many small firms do not use (or need) advanced
management practices. Large firms were excluded to ensure that the responses from a single plant
manager are broadly representative of the firm’s overall practices. Dropping large firms also makes it
unlikely that the WMS interviewer would have any pre-conceived impressions about the firm or its
management practices.
The WMS survey is targeted at plant managers, who are typically senior enough to have a good
understanding of management practices but not so senior as to be detached from day-to-day operations.13
To insure high response rates and reliable answers the WMS was conducted by MBA-type students with
some business experience and training. German firms in the WMS were also contacted prior to the
survey with a letter of endorsement from the Bundesbank. Importantly, participants were informed that
the survey was for a “piece of work on lean manufacturing”, with no mention of the words “survey” or
“research”. Moreover, interviewees were never asked for financial data – instead these data were
obtained directly from the ORBIS data base. Finally, the interviewers were encouraged to be persistent,
so they typically conducted two interviews a day lasting about 45 minutes each, and spent the rest of
their time contacting managers to schedule interviews. These protocols helped to yield a 44% response
rate which was uncorrelated with the (independently collected) performance measures.
German firms in the WMS were interviewed in 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2014. Since the estimated worker
and firm effects are only available for the years up to 2009, we only use the first three survey waves,
which included 365 medium-sized manufacturing firms, some of which were interviewed two or three
times (we cluster standard errors at the firm level to deal with this).14

The survey also collects information on a set of “noise controls” about the interview itself, including the time of day and
day of the week, characteristics of the interviewee, and the identity of the interviewer. We check whether our results are
robust to including these controls our regression analysis.
14
We also looked at the panel dimension of firms, but the panel dimension only exists for a relatively small number of firms
and there is not enough real time series variation (given measurement error) to identify any significant relationships.
13

Our main measure of management quality was constructed by z-scoring (normalizing to mean 0,
standard deviation 1) the 18 individual questions in the WMS, averaging these and then z-scoring this
average. This process yields a management index with mean zero and standard deviation one.
b. Worker-Level Data from the IEB
The worker-level data used in our analysis come from the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB)
data base maintained by the IAB. For each job lasting a day or more, the IEB includes employee
information such as age, gender and education, employer information such as industry and location, and
job-spell-based information on characteristics such as full time or part time status, average daily wages,
and occupation. It also includes information on benefit spells for workers who are receiving regular
unemployment benefits or unemployment assistance. Dorner et al. (2010) provide more information on
the sources of data used to create the IEB data.
Appendix A3 describes how we merge firms in the WMS to establishments in the IEB data, primarily
using the firm/establishment addresses in both datasets, enabling us to link 361 of the 365 firm in the
WMS to an establishment identifier in the IEB. We then searched the IEB data base to identify all
individuals who had worked at one (or more) of the matched firms for at least one day between 2002
and 2009. We located a total of 251,872 workers who met this criterion. For some of our descriptive
correlations and for our analysis of productivity we construct a panel data set using employee rosters as
of June 30 to define the set of workers at a given firm in a given year.
To measure worker skills and the wage premiums offered by different firms we use the estimated worker
and firm effects estimated by CHK. CHK convert the job spell information in the IEB into a longitudinal
panel with information on a worker’s main job in each year and estimate a version of equation (4) by
ordinary least squares. A limitation of the IEB data is that there is no information on usual hours of
work during a job spell. For this reason, CHK limit their analysis to full time workers: no worker effects
are available for part time employees or those who hold so-called mini-jobs.15 Henceforth when we refer
to “wages”, the reader should bear in mind we are referring to daily wages (rather than the hourly wage).
Another limitation of the IEB data is that daily wage is censored for about 10% of men and 2% of
women. CHK use a Tobit model to allocate earnings for the censored cases. (A similar procedure was
used by Dustmann, Ludsteck, and Schonberg, 2009, who also provide some information on the quality
of the Tobit approximation to the upper tail of wages in Germany).
They also exclude job spells where a worker is in training, and spells worked by individuals younger than 20, older than
60, or with less than 1 year of potential labor market experience.
15

CHK estimated separate models for full-time male and female workers age 20-60 in four overlapping
intervals: 1985-1991, 1990-1996, 1996-2002 and 2002-2009. For our productivity models we use the
estimates from the 2002-2009 interval, which roughly correspond to the survey years for the WMS
(2004-2009). For all our analysis we use the worker effects from the 1996-2002 interval, as this predates the measurement of management in 2004, except for the outflow analysis where we use the 20022009 period.
Overall we have estimated person effects for 88% of all workers in the matched WMS firms (98% of
the relevant population of workers in these firms – e.g. excluding part-timers and workers at firms in
East Germany, which were excluded by CHK). In all firm level models we control for a quadratic
function of the coverage ratio (the proportion of workers in the firm for which we have employee fixed
effects) to partially control for any systematic selectivity biases.
For our inflow and outflow analysis we construct average information by firm on workers who join a
sample firm or leave a sample firm in the period from 2003 to 2009. Specifically, we focus on three
types of joiners: job-to-job joiners, who transition from some other firm to a sample firm with no more
than 2 months between the end of the previous job and the start of the new job; joiners from
unemployment, who transition from a spell of registered unemployment to a sample firm with no more
than 2 months between the end of the unemployment spell and the start of the new job; and all other
joiners. The latter group includes new labor market entrants, recent immigrants, people who have been
on maternity leave, people moving from self-employment or a job in the civil service,16 and people with
longer gaps between their prior job or benefit spell. Likewise, we focus on three types of leavers: jobto-job leavers, who move to a new firm within 2 months of leaving a sample firm; leavers to
unemployment, who enter a spell of registered unemployment within 2 months of leaving a job at a
sample firm; and all other leavers.
We also match in several other datasets to our merged WMS-IEB sample. We use ORBIS for firm-level
information on sales, intermediate inputs (materials) and capital. From the OECD STAN dataset we
have industry-level average data on gross output and labor costs, which we match to the WMS plants at
the three digit level to estimate cost shares. We use the 2000-2009 averages from the STAN data to
approximately match the time period of the management data.

Self-employed workers and civil servants are excluded from the IEB.

c. Overview of the Matched WMS and IEB Dataset
Panel A of Table 1 gives an overview of the key characteristics of the firms included in our matched
WMS-IEB sample (exact definitions of the variables are presented in Table A1). The firms are
distributed across 15 of the 16 German Federal states, with 13% in East Germany. On average, sample
firms have been in business for 64 years, employ 440 workers, and pay a daily wage of just over €100.
About a quarter of all workers at these firms are female and 12% have a university degree.
The next two rows of the table show the average cost shares of intermediate inputs and labor inputs,
based on industry-wide averages for German firms reported in the STAN data set. The input share of
intermediate inputs is relatively large (67% on average) while the average labor share is 23%. Thus,
labor costs account for just over two-thirds of value added.
From the WMS we also have information on ownership structure –whether the firm is family-owned,
non-family privately owned, or institutionally owned (typically by a local government or quasigovernmental agency). The sample includes firms in a wide range of ownership situations, including
about 23% family owned and 13% institutionally owned.
Finally, the remaining rows of Panel A show sample statistics for the WMS management score, and for
the average estimated worker effects and establishment-level wage premiums. For ease of interpretation,
we standardize the management score index and the estimated worker and firm effects to have mean 0
and standard deviation of 1.17 We have estimated employee fixed effects for just under four-fifths of the
workers who can be matched to a WMS firm.18

IV. RESULTS
a. Descriptive Analysis
We begin our analysis of the relationship between management quality, workforce selection, and
productivity with some simple descriptive comparisons. Figures 1 and 2 show how the distributions of

The estimated person and firm effects in an AKM model are only identified up to a linear constant. Since the male and
female models are estimated separately, the person effects are normalized differently. We re-center the male and female
effects to have mean zero across all firms in our sample, then average the person effects for males and females, then
standardize the resulting mean.
18
The coverage is smaller in East Germany, where we can only merge an ability measure if the employee has been in a
connected with a West German firm. We show robustness to dropping all East German firms.

wages and estimated person effects, respectively, differ between firms with relatively high management
scores and other firms. To construct Figure 1 we begin by finding the quintiles of daily wages for all
workers who are matched to a firm in the WMS sample. We then identified the “best managed firms” –
those with management scores in the top 10% of firms in the sample – and all other firms (i.e., those
with management scores in the bottom 90%) and calculated the fractions of workers in each wage
quintile at the two groups of firms. As shown in the right-hand panel of Figure 1, the best-managed
firms have a relatively high share of workers in the top wage quintile (26%) and a relatively low share
in the bottom quintile (13.4%).
To construct Figure 2 we followed the same procedure, but used the estimated worker effects, which
proxy for the long run human capital of the workforce. The differences between the best managed firms
and all other firms are a little different using this measure. The best managed firms have more workers
in the top 2 quintiles than other firms, but no fewer in the bottom quintile. Instead, the gap is made up
by a shortfall in the shares of workers in quintiles 2 and 3 of the person effects – the lower-middle of the
skill distribution. As discussed in more detail below, Figures 1 and 2 imply that firms with more
advanced management practices have somewhat lower dispersion in daily wages but wider dispersion
in worker skills.19
More insight into the potential complementarity between advanced management practices and the
human capital distribution of the workforce is provided in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 is a simple binscatter plot of average management scores (on the y-axis) against the average human capital of all
employees a firm, as measured by the average person effects (on the x-axis). Figure 4 is a similar binscatter using measures of management scores and mean person effects that have been residualized to
control for the effect of firm size. The positive relationship between management quality and the average
human capital of the workforce is particularly strong after controlling for firm size, which previous work
has shown is very strongly correlated with management practice scores (e.g. Bloom et al, 2014).
Next we examine the correlates of firm productivity. Figure 5 shows the non-parametric relationship
between labor productivity - measured by log sales per worker - and the WMS management score. As
noted by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) there is a positive relationship between the two even after
controlling for firm size. Figure 6 presents an analogous scatterplot for productivity and the average
CHK show that over the past three decades establishments in West Germany have become more specialized in terms of
the distribution of occupations. Contrary to our expectations, Figure 2 suggests that this tendency is not more pronounced
among middle sized manufacturing firms with higher management scores.
19

employee fixed effects. There is also a clear positive relationship here, motivating our question of
whether the impact of management practices on productivity is mediated through employee talent.
Interestingly the relationship is quite convex, hinting at a greater role for the skill level of managers in
determining productivity, as specified in equation (6).
b. Correlates of Management Practice Scores
To provide more contextual information on the relationship between workforce quality and management
practices, we estimated a series of simple regression models, summarized in Table 2, that relate the
management z-score at each firm to measures of employee quality and other firm characteristics. All
the specifications also control for firm size, the share of female workers, ownership status, the number
of competitors, firm age, three digit industry, survey year, and location in East Germany.20 Column (1)
relates management scores to mean employee quality, and confirms the strong positive correlation
suggested in Figures 3 and 4. Column (2) focuses on mean ability of the top quarter of employees, which
we assume is a measure of the human capital of the firm’s managers. The coefficient on “managerial
ability” is about 45% larger than the effect of average employee ability. Column (3) enters both
measures and shows that it is managerial ability that matters more – the coefficient on average employee
ability is insignificant conditional on managerial ability. As shown in column (4), this result is robust to
controlling for another measure of average human capital, the share of college-educated workers at the
firm. In Table A2 we show this finding is also robust to including other measures of observable human
capital (experience, age and tenure), none of which have a large or significant correlation with
management scores.
Overall Table 2 suggests that the management practice scores and human capital (especially managerial
ability) are complementary, in the sense that they co-vary together.
IV.B Quantifying the Channels Linking Management Practices to Productivity
a. Analysis Based on Production Function Estimation
We begin our analysis of productivity in Table 3 with a straightforward production function approach
as in equation (7). The basic specifications in columns (1)-(4) control for labor inputs only, while the
models in columns (5) and (6) include labor and capital, and those in columns (7)-(10) include labor,
capital, and intermediate inputs.
Note that to avoid losing observations due to missing values for the control variables we set missing values to the sample
mean and include a dummy for an imputed value. Only a handful of firms have missing data for most control variables, but
92 firms have missing data on capital (which is not included in Table 2 but is used in later tables).
20

14

Looking first at the specifications that exclude capital and intermediate inputs, the estimates in column
(1) show that the WMS management score variable has a relatively large partial correlation with
productivity (0.26) when there are no controls for worker ability. The magnitude of this coefficient is
similar to the coefficient from a parallel specification fit to the overall WMS sample covering 34
countries, reported by Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2015). The coefficient on the management score
variable falls to 0.20 when we control for average employee ability (column 2), to 0.15 when we control
for both average worker ability and managerial ability, and to 0.13 when we add a further control for the
share of college-educated workers.21 Thus, without taking account of variation in capital and
intermediate inputs, one would conclude that up to about one-half of the (relatively large) effect of
management scores on productivity is explained by the fact that firms with more advanced management
practices hire better quality workers – particularly in the upper stratum of the skill distribution.
Column (5) introduces a control for capital (measured by the book value of capital). Despite the wellknown limitations of book value-based capital measures, this variable has a large positive coefficient
that is relatively precisely estimated. Introducing capital into the production function leads to a relatively
large reduction (-40%) in the coefficient on the management score, and to noticeable declines in the
coefficients on average worker ability, managerial ability, and the fraction of college graduates.
Nevertheless, all four remain at least marginally significant.
So far we have focused on the impact of measures of worker quality on the measured effect of the
managerial score variable. As discussed in Section 2, however, firm-specific pay policies may also
affect productivity if they are used by the firm to reward greater effort. Some descriptive evidence on
this mechanism is presented in Figure 7. Panel A shows a bin-scatter plot relating the estimated firmspecific wage premiums to log(sales per worker). These are positively related, as has also been
documented in other countries (e.g. Card, Cardoso and Kline, 2015, for Portugal and Abowd et al, 1999,
for France). Panel B presents a bin-scatter plot of the wage premiums against the WMS management
scores. Again, there is a strong positive relationship, suggesting that firms that use advanced
management practices tend to pay higher wages to their workers relative to the outside labor market. If
we regress the firm fixed effect on management scores there is a significant and positive correlation with
and without the other controls (see Table A7).

In this column a standard deviation increase in management scores is associated with a 13% increase in productivity which
is similar to the findings of the Indian RCTs and non-experimental regressions across all countries (Bloom et al, 2014).
21

15

In column (6) of Table 3 we introduce the firm-specific wage premium as an additional control. As
expected given the scatter plots this variable has a positive and significant effect. Its inclusion also leads
to a further reduction in the effect of the management score variable.
Finally, columns (7)-(10) present estimates for production functions that control for labor, capital, and
intermediate inputs.22 The baseline specification in column (7) includes only the management score
variable and the controls for factor inputs. Relative to the parallel specification in column (1), the effect
of management practices is reduced by around 80%. Evidently, more advanced management practices
are more likely to be adopted by firms with more capital intensive production techniques that also use
larger shares of intermediate inputs. Controlling for these factors, the coefficient in row 1 implies that
a 1 standard deviation unit increase in management practices is associated with a 4.3% increase in
productivity.
Column (8) adds the two worker ability measures to the 3-factor production function. Both variables
are marginally significant and their addition reduces the management-TFP relationship to 0.035. In
column (9) management practices and ability remain significant even conditional on the share of college
educated. Finally, in column 10 we add in the estimated firm-specific pay premium, which leads to a
reduction in the point estimates for the effects of the management score and worker quality variables.
With only 229 firms included in the analysis we have reached the limits of the data to distinguish between
the different channels.
The models in Table 3 use a simple average of the 18 management questions on the WMS survey as a
measure of management practices. We have checked the robustness of our findings by using other ways
of summarizing the WMS questions, such as using principal components, and by looking at subsets of
the question-specific scores. For example, Table A6 presents a series of models similar to ones in Table
3, but using the first principal component of all 18 questions. Overall, the results are qualitatively and
quantitatively similar to those based on simple averages of the z-scores.
b. Analysis Based on TFP
In Table 4 we implement our preferred TFP specification based on equation (8). This approach has the
advantage relative to the production approach used in Table 3 of moving the conventional factor inputs
Information on intermediate inputs is missing for a sizeable fraction of firms in ORBIS, leading to a 30% reduction in
sample size. Unlike the case for other control variables we decided not to try and impute the value of intermediate inputs if
it was missing.

(labor, capital, and materials) from the right hand side to left hand side of the regression, reducing the
effects of measurement errors and endogeneity biases. Moreover, the coefficients on labor, capital and
materials are allowed to vary across detailed subindustries according to their cost shares. On the other
hand a TFP approach assumes that the output elasticities with respect to the three factor inputs are equal
to their cost shares, an assumption which may not be strictly correct.
In general the broad pattern of results in Table 4 is similar to the pattern in Table 3, but the more
parsimonious specification allows us to estimate the key variables more precisely. The first four columns
of the table present models where we exclude the firm size, industry, and ownership controls, whereas
the last four columns present models with these controls included (as in Table 3). As we move from
column (1) to column (2) we observe that the controlling for employee quality reduces the management
coefficient by 24% (= (0.08-0.06))/0.08). Controlling for managerial ability reduces the management
effect by another 14% and controlling for the firm wage premium reduces it by another 16%. So
altogether the reduced form association of TFP with management is roughly halved when we introduce
these additional controls.
We repeat the specifications of columns (1)-(4) in the last four columns of Table 4, but include more
extensive controls. The results show a qualitatively similar pattern, although the fraction of the
management coefficient explained by the other controls is smaller (the original management association
of 0.048 is reduced by about 30% by the final column). Employee ability accounts for only 3%,
managerial ability 13% and establishment fixed effects in pay a further 13%. The fraction accounted for
by average employee ability falls compared to the first four columns because we are now controlling for
the share of employees with a college degree throughout. This suggests that in understanding the
productivity-management practice correlation, the unobserved human capital (recovered by the AKM
specifications) of average workers matters less than managerial human capital.
We summarize our estimation results and their implications for our simple structural model in Table 5.
Recall that the model consists of equation (5), which relates overall workforce quality to average human
capital (𝜂̂ ̅𝑗 ), the firm’s pay premium ( 𝜓̂𝑗 ), and observed management practices (Λ 𝑗 ) (with coefficients
𝜌1 , 𝜌2 , and 𝜌3 , respectively); equation (6), which relates TFP to managerial human capital 𝜂̂ ̅𝑀𝑗 and
management practices (with coefficients 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 , respectively); and equation (8), which is a loglinearized three factor production function with coefficients equal to the cost shares of the factors. From

17

the reduced form coefficients we can recover 𝜌1 , 𝜌2 , 𝜆1 , and the composite management effect 𝑠𝐿 𝜌3 +
𝜆2 .
Table 5 shows the reduced form parameter estimates and the associated estimates of the structural
parameters 𝜌1 , and 𝜌2 from the basic TFP specification in column (4) of Table 4, the extended TFP
specification in column (8) of Table 4, and the production function estimates in column (10) of Table 3.
Reassuringly, the estimated reduced form and structural parameters are fairly similar across these three
specifications. The implied values of 𝜌
̂1 (the effect of higher average human capital on labor quality)
̂2 (the effect of a higher pay premium on labor quality)
are between 0.4 and 0.5, the implied values of 𝜌
are between 0.2 and 0.3, the implied values of 𝜆1 (the effect of a higher human capital of managers on
TFP) are between 0.05 and 0.08, and composite effects of (standardized) management ability on TFP
are between 0.03 and 0.04.
While the estimates of the effect of workers’ average human capital on labor quality (𝜌
̂)
1 are relatively
large, they are still far below 1.0, which is the expected effect if a 1% increase in the average person
effect at a firm leads to a 1% increase in labor quality. There are three likely explanations for the gap.
First, the worker effects are estimated with error. Second, the firm-wide average skill measure excludes
part-timers, trainees, and workers outside the 20-60 age range. Third, there is some slippage introduced
by the presence of multi-plant establishments in our sample, since we only merge firms to a single
establishment in the IEB data base.23 We suspect that all three factors lead to some attenuation in the
measured effect of average worker quality.
Our finding that higher firm-specific wage premiums contribute to average productivity, albeit less than
proportionally, is also interesting. Taken at face value, point estimates for 𝜌
̂2 in the range of 0.20 to 0.30
suggest that firms receive only a partial productivity offset from offering higher pay. Again, we suspect
that the estimates could be attenuated by measurement errors in the AKM procedure, and by slippage in
the match between firms and establishments.
Finally, the finding that average managerial quality has an independent effect on TFP, holding constant
the average quality of the workforce, provides empirical support for the channel emphasized in Lucas’s
(1978) original span of control model and many subsequent models of the effect of managers on TFP.

The establishment identified in the IEB can actually combine 2 or more plants if the plants are all in the same location and
assigned the same narrow industry code.
23

18

We also conclude from the pattern of coefficients on the management practice variables (e.g., between
columns 1 and 4 in Table 4) that the observed effect of management practices in simpler specifications
represents a combination of direct and indirect effects via workforce selection and pay practices. We
turn in the next sub-section to see whether there is any direct evidence that some of the role of
management practices operates via selection.
IVC. Inflows and Outflows
We have shown that firms with a more able workforce, and in particular more able workers in the top
quarter of the skill distribution, tend to have better management practices and higher productivity. We
now investigate in more detail how firms come to have higher ability employees by looking at the
inflows and outflows of workers to our firms.
As background, Panel B of Table 1 shows the total numbers of individuals we observe in the IEB data
set who join or leave one of the matched WBS firms. In total we observe about 122,436 joiners and
132,600 leavers (roughly 350 joiners and leavers per firm, on average). Most inflows (58%) and most
outflows (57%) are job-to-job transitions, but substantial fractions of new hires come from
unemployment (16%) and from other sources (27%). Likewise many job leavers exit to unemployment
(30%) or to other destinations (13%).24
Table 6 presents an analysis of the relationship between management ability measures and the faction
of new recruits at a firm with estimated person effects at or above various percentiles of the overall
distribution among all new recruits. The person effects for this analysis are those estimated by CHK for
the period 1996-2002, prior to the start of the jobs under analysis here. Each column of the table shows
the coefficient of the management ability index in a model for the fraction of new recruits with person
effects at or above the percentile listed in the column heading (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles).
In column (5) for example, the dependent variable is the proportion of workers who were in the top
decile of the ability distribution, based on their estimated person effects in the period from 1996 to 2002.
We present two sets of specifications: a simpler set of models (Panel A) that control for location,
ownership, industry, female share, and production market competition; and a richer set of specifications
(Panel B) that also control for firm size. In both specifications the coefficient on the management score
is positive at every percentile, but particularly strong for workers in the top of the distribution. In the
Recall that the third category includes “out of the labor force” as well as employment in jobs outside the coverage of the
IEB (self-employment and the civil service).
24

19

specifications without size controls the management score coefficients for the 75th and 90th percentiles
are highly significant. As shown in the second panel, these effects are attenuated once we control for
firm size, but the coefficient in the 90th percentile model remains marginally significant. Tables A3 and
A4 repeat the analysis, fitting separate models for inflows from a previous job and from
unemployment.25 The results are broadly robust to disaggregating in this way. Overall, we conclude
that better managed firms are a little more likely to recruit workers from the upper tail of the ability
distribution.
Table 7 turns to the effect of management ability on the composition of outflows to unemployment.
These flows are particularly interesting because they arguably reflect termination decisions by the firm
(i.e., decisions to fire or lay off a worker), rather than decisions by workers to move to another job or
withdraw from the labor force. The dependent variable in all the models in Table 7 is the average value
of the person effect for leavers who move to unemployment, normalized by deviating from the mean
person effect at the firm among all employees in the previous year. Thus, the coefficients reflect the
impact of higher management ability on the differential layoff/firing rate of higher or lower-ability
workers.
The results in Table 7 suggest that firms with higher management scores are significantly less likely to
fire or lay off their relatively high-ability workers. This correlation remains robust in column (2) to more
general controls for firm size, location, the shares of college educated and female workers, firm age,
competition and ownership. Nevertheless, one might be concerned that the relative skill level of workers
who are laid off or fired from a particular firm is correlated with some other characteristics of the worker.
Consequently we also experimented with conditioning on some of the observable characteristics of the
outflow group, such as age (in column (3)) and whether the individual was college educated (column
(4)). Interestingly, these controls tend to increase the magnitude of the management score coefficient,
suggesting that the “quality preference” of better-managed firms is stronger within traditionally
measured skill groups than between groups.26

Haltiwanger, Hyatt and McEntarfer (2015) show that there are differential patterns by firm size (and firm wage) for jobto-job flows compared to other type of flows.
26
We repeated these specifications looking at outflows to jobs at other firms (see Appendix Tables A4). Although the results
were of a similar sign they were generally weaker, which is consistent with our prior that the firm policy variables are most
likely to be seen when looking at exits to unemployment.
25

20

Tables 6 and 7 together confirm that firms with high WMS management scores select higher ability
employees and exit lower ability employees to a greater extent than other firms. This is a clear
mechanism through which they end up with a larger fraction of high ability incumbent employees. We
estimate that it would take about 9 years for a firm which moved from the bottom 90% into the top decile
of WMS management scores to converge to the average employee ability score of its peers purely
through improving the quality of the inflows and outflows.27
IVD. Management Practices and the within plant Dispersion of Wages and ability
So far we have focused on the importance of management practices for the differences in mean levels
of productivity and worker ability across firms. In part, this focus is driven by the recent literature
emphasizing the role of widening between-firm inequality in overall labor market inequality trends (e.g.,
Faggio et al., 2010; Card, Heining and Kline, 2013, Barth et al., 2014; and Song et al, 2015). But an
interesting question is whether advanced management practices are also related to the degree of withinfirm inequality.
We investigate this issue in Table 8. We begin in columns (1) and (2) with specifications that take the
90-10 difference in log(wages) at each firm in our sample as the dependent variable. As suggested by
the pattern in Figure 1, there is a modest negative correlation between use of advanced management
practices and within-firm wage inequality, though the effect is at best only marginally significant. In
columns (3) and (4) we use the coefficient of variation in log daily wages as an alternative measure of
within-firm dispersion. With or without other controls firm wage variation is strongly negatively
correlated with the firm’s management score. Columns (5)-(8) present a parallel set of models, taking as
a dependent variable the corresponding measure of within-firm inequality in worker quality, as measured
by the estimated person effects. Again the findings are consistent with the simple graphical evidence in
Figure 2, suggesting that better managed firms have a slightly wider distribution of worker skill.

27

If we compare firms in the top decile of management to the rest there is a difference of 0.007 (0.554
vs. 0.547) in the average employee fixed effect. The difference in the average employee ability of joiners
from the labor force between these two groups of firms is 0.004 (0.555 vs. 0.551), but the inflow rates
are similar at 6.7%. Hence, improving the quality of inflows will bridge 4.5% (= 0.004*0.067/0.007) of
the employee ability gap per year. The ability difference of outflows to unemployment is larger at 0.014,
but the mean outflow rate is only 3.1%, which makes a contribution of 6.5% (= 0.031*0.014/0.007).
Putting the inflows and outflows channels together implies 11% of the ability gap is closed per year.

21

Overall the conclusion from Table 8 is that firms with high management scores tend to have a little more
dispersion in skills and a little less dispersion in overall wages. The opposite signs imply that bettermanaged firms tend to implement “equalizing” pay policies that offset their more unequal skill
distributions – a pattern that is inconsistent with the additive proportional pay premium imposed by the
AKM specification. We believe that additional work on the relationship between within-firm inequality
and management practices could be a fruitful area for additional research with larger samples. One
interesting question is whether advanced management practices are related to the use of outsourcing
practices, which in some cases at least lead to a reduction in the variation in skill levels at the firm (e.g.,
Goldschmidt and Schmieder, 2015).
IVE. Extensions and Robustness
We also investigated many other outcomes discussed in the Appendix. We examined whether there was
faster wage growth (as a proxy for promotion) for the more able employees in better managed firms
(Table A5). Interacting management scores and worker ability together in the wage growth equation we
did find that better managed firms seemed to promote high ability workers more quickly, but the
coefficient was insignificant.
Another question is whether our approach of using the AKM fixed effects to proxy for employee,
managerial and firm “quality” buys us any more information than simply conditioning on average
wages? There is a tradition in firm-level productivity analysis to include the wage bill instead of
employment as a measure of “labor services” (e.g. Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). Under competitive
markets and perfect substitutability between heterogeneous workers this seems an attractive approach as
the wage bill is usually available in firm accounts, whereas individual wages are not.
Table A8 investigates this issue, beginning in column (1) with the basic TFP specification from column
(1) of Table 4. In column (2) we include the log of the average wage bill per employee, taken from the
firm-wide ORBIS accounts. Consistent with existing work this suggests higher TFP in firms with higher
average “accounting wages” as the coefficient is positive and (weakly) significant increasing the R2 from
0.561 to 0.575. If instead of the accounting wage we include our preferred controls there is a larger
increase in the R2 to 0.685. Furthermore, the average wage estimated from firm accounts is now
insignificant conditional on our controls for person and firm fixed effects in column (4). In column (5)
we include the average of the individual log(wages) from the IEB. This is much more powerful than the
accounting measure (which probably has greater measurement error) explaining 0.679 of the variance,
almost as much as our AKM measures in the previous column. Nevertheless, including our AKM
22

measures gives additional information over and above the simple average individual wage, with
employee and managerial ability remaining significant (the joint F-test of the three AKM terms is 9.84
which is significant at the 1% level). The bottom line from this is that our AKM approach adds much
more information than simply using the wage bill, and significantly more than simply the average of
individual wages of the workers currently in the firm.28
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have examined whether some core management practices found to be important for firm
productivity (e.g. in Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007) are due to the higher ability of employees, especially
managers, in these firm. We merge the near-population administrative data matched worker-firms in
Germany (the IEB) with the WMS management data. We estimate an overall measure of individual
ability for each worker using the employee fixed effects from wage equations in the manner of Abowd
et al (1999). This approach also provides us with information on ability of the top quartile of workers,
who we interpret as the firm’s managers, and with an estimate of the average pay premium paid by the
firm relative to the outside labor market.
We show several interesting stylized facts in our data. First, we find a strong relationship between
average employee ability and management practices. This is particularly strong at the top end of the
ability distribution, suggesting that managerial ability is important in explaining why some firms have
high management scores (over and above average worker skills). When we estimate production
functions we find that firms with higher worker and managerial human capital have higher productivity.
However, the WMS management scores remain significant in production functions and TFP equations
even after conditioning on all measures of employee ability. Including human capital reduces the
association of productivity with management by 25 to 50 percent. Although we can never rule out the
idea that there could be further aspects of human capital we are not accounting for, the continued
importance of management practices in firm performance regressions is striking.
Delving further into the management-ability relationship, we show that well managed firms have a
higher stock of higher ability workers employees. They accomplish this at least in part by selection.

As with Table 2, we also considered controlling for a number of other observable measures of human capital such as
general experience and tenure in the job or firm in the TFP regressions, but these did not make any substantial difference to
the results.

They are able to recruit workers from higher points of the ability distribution and remove those from the
lower part of the distribution. This is revealed through our analysis of inflows and outflows of workers.
Taken as a whole our results suggest that human capital, especially managerial human capital is
important for the ability to sustain successful management practices. However, there appears to be
information in the management practice scores that predicts productivity that is not reducible to the
atoms of human capital employed in the firm. This could be what some scholars have termed corporate
culture - something that makes a firm more than simply its sum of parts.
This is a fascinating research path to pursue as it links economics with other areas of social science.
However, it may be that we are still not properly measuring all aspects of human capital in the firm. The
censoring of the wage distribution may mean, for example, we underestimate the talent of senior
managers. Combining the data we have here with richer information on the talent of top managers would
be an important extension of our work (e.g. Bandiera et al, 2011).

Notes: “High Management Score” firms are those in the top decile of the WMS management score.
“Low Management Score” firms are all other firms. We bin all workers into quintiles based on the overall
distributions of wages or worker ability (as measured by worker fixed effects). Bin 1=lowest 20% and
bin 5 = highest 20%. We then tabulate the fractions of workers in each quintile at firms in the top 10%
of management scores and all other firms.

ONLINE APPENDICES: NOT INTENDED FOR
PUBLICATION
APPENDIX A: DATA
A1. Management Data
We overview the WMS data here. More information on an earlier version of the dataset
can be found in Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2015). More details on the management
survey in general (including datasets, methods and an on-line benchmarking tool) is
available on http://worldmanagementsurvey.org/.
Our sampling frame was based on the Bureau van Dijk (BVD) ORBIS dataset. This
provided sufficient information on companies to conduct a stratified telephone survey
(company name, address, industry and a size indicator). BVD has accounting information
on employment, sales and (for most German firms) capital. Apart from size, we did not
insist on having accounting information to form the sampling population. In every country,
including Germany, the sampling frame for the management survey was all firms with a
manufacturing primary industry code (SIC 1987 code between 2000 and 3999), with
between 50 and 5,000 employees in the most recent year prior to the survey.
Interviewers were each given a randomly selected list of firms from the sampling frame.
This should therefore be representative of medium sized manufacturing firms. In addition
to randomly surveying from the sampling frame described above we also resurveyed firms
in 2006 and 2009 that we interviewed in the 2004 survey wave used in Bloom and Van
Reenen (2007). This was a sample of 732 firms from France, Germany, the UK and the
US. In 2009 we also resurveyed all firms interviewed in 2006.
The accounting databases are used to generate our management survey. How does this
compare to Census data? In Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2012) we analyze this in more
detail. For example, we compare the number of employees for different size bands from
our sample with the figures for the corresponding manufacturing populations obtained from
national Census Bureau data from each of the countries. There are several reasons for
mismatch between Census data and firm level accounts.29 Despite these potential
differences, the broad picture is that the sample matches up reasonably with the population
of medium sized manufacturing firms. This suggests our sampling frame covers near to the
population of all firms for most countries
First, even though we only use unconsolidated firm accounts, employment may include some jobs in
overseas branches. Second, the time of when employment is recorded in a Census year will differ from that
recorded in firm accounts. Third, the precise definition of “enterprise” in the Census may not correspond to
the “firm” in company accounts. Fourth, we keep firms whose primary industry is manufacturing whereas
Census data includes only plants whose primary industry code is manufacturing. Fifth, there may be
duplication of employment in accounting databases due to the treatment of consolidated accounts. Finally,
reporting of employment is not mandatory for the accounts of all firms in all countries.
29

41

Of the German firms we contacted 58.6% took part in the survey: a high success rate given
the voluntary nature of participation, which was aided by our endorsement letter from the
Bundesbank (the German Central Bank). Of the remaining firms 27.2% refused to be
surveyed, while the remaining 14.2% were in the process of being scheduled when the
survey ended. In Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen (2015) we analyze the probability of being
interviewed. Larger firms and multinationals were more likely to agree to be interviewed,
although the size of this effect is not large or significant – firms were about 4 percentage
points more likely for a doubling in size. Further, the decision to be interviewed is
uncorrelated with revenues per worker, a basic productivity measure. This is an important
result as it suggests we are not interviewing particularly high or low performing firms. Firm
age and return on capital are also uncorrelated with response rates.
We have firm accounting data on sales, employment, capital, intermediate inputs, profits,
shareholder equity, long-term debt, market values (for quoted firms) and wages (where
available). BVD have extensive information on ownership structure, so we can use this to
identify whether the firm was part of a multinational enterprise. We also asked specific
questions on the multinational status of the firm (whether it owned plants aboard and the
country where the parent company is headquartered) to be able to distinguish domestic
multinationals from foreign multinationals. We collected many variables through our
survey including information on plant size, skills, organization, etc. as described in the
main text.
Management Practices were scored following the methodology of Bloom and Van Reenen
(2007), with practices grouped into three areas: monitoring (eight practices), targets (five
practices) and incentives (five practices). The monitoring section focuses on the
introduction of lean manufacturing techniques, the documentation of processes
improvements, the tracking of performance of individuals, reviewing performance, and
consequence management. The targets section examines the type of targets, the realism of
the targets, the transparency of targets and the range and interconnection of targets. Finally,
the incentives section includes promotion criteria, pay and bonuses, and fixing or firing
bad performers, where best practice is deemed the approach that gives strong rewards for
those with both ability and effort. Our management measure averages the z-scores of all
18 dimensions and then z-scores again this average. Details of all the questions are in
Appendix B.
A2. Estimating Employee and Firm Fixed Effects in the IEB
We follow Card et al (2013) in estimating the worker and firm fixed effects (see their online
appendix
for
more
details,
http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/suppl/2013/04/02/qjt006.DC1/QJEC12803_KLINE_
online_appendix_compiled.pdf)
Briefly, the IEB consists of information on employment spells at a given establishment
within a calendar-year, the average daily wage (censored at the Social Security maximum
earnings level); information on the gender, birth date, education and occupation of the
individual and the industry and geographical location of the firm.

42

We use all full-time males and females age 20-60 working for non-marginal jobs. One
observation per person-firm-year is selected (excluding those with a daily wage under 10
Euros). Education is coded into 5 classes.
Roughly 10% of person-year observations for male workers and 1-2% of observations for
female workers are top coded. We follow Dustmann et al (2009) and a fit a series of Tobit
models to log daily wages. We then impute an uncensored value for each censored
observation using the estimated parameters of these models and a random draw from the
associated (left-censored) distribution. 500 Tobit models are estimated separately by year,
education and 10 year age range with the following variables: age, mean log wage in other
years, fraction of censored wages, a dummy for individuals only observed one year 19852009, and a dummy for one worker firm. Card et al (2013) report various validation
exercises for the Tobit specifications.
Estimation of equation (4) proceeded in two steps. First the model is fitted to the sample
of movers between firms to recover the vector of establishment fixed effects along with the
vector of coefficients on the time varying covariates. Then for each worker who stayed at
the same establishment over the sample interval, the estimated person effect is calculated
as a residual averaged over the time period the worker stayed at the same workplace.
The main fixed effects we use in this paper rely on the period 1996-2002 (see text) prior to
the management surveys. The only exception is the outflow analysis were we use the fixed
effects estimated in 2002-09.
A3. Merging Firms in WMS with IEB
As noted in the text, the WMS sampling frame was taken from the BVD ORBIS database
for Germany (which is the population of incorporated firms). We selected firms whose
primary industry was manufacturing and who reported having between 50 and 5,000
employees. Interviewers were given random lists of names and telephone numbers within
this frame and sought to interview a plant manager in the firm. The address of the plant
(and name of manager) was collected when a successful interview occurred.
The IEB is an establishment-level database where we also know the address and name of
the establishment. Although most firms are single plant, there can be multi-plant
establishments and firms. We used a master list maintained by the Federal Employment
Agency and merged using a probabilistic record linkage based on firm names and
addresses.30 Data from both sources underwent extensive preprocessing to harmonize
spelling and correct typing errors. For the data linkage process we were supported by the
German Record Linkage Center and used the probabilistic Jaro algorithm (Jaro, 1989)
implemented in the Merge-Tool-Box (Bachteler, 2011).31 To speed up the linkage process
The master list is the BA-Betriebedatei 2006 and contains information on approximately 2 million
establishments.
31
The Merge-Tool-Box is a free Java based record linkage program developed by Rainer Schnell (Schnell et
al. 2005).
30

43

we blocked the data on three-digit postcodes, and limited the matching process to
plants/establishments in the same three-digit postcode (with at most one match per plant).
We then conducted manual quality checks and editing (including internet research on firm
names and addresses) for plants in the WMS that were unmatched, or were matched with
relative uncertainty.
For the majority of the WMS data we can match to IEB straightforwardly on address and
name. For some WMS plants belonging to multi-plant companies, we have the issue that
IEB name may not correspond easily to the company name. We do, however, have the
address from both IEB and WMS which usually resolved any ambiguity. When there still
remained any ambiguity (e.g. multiple establishments in a single address, like an industrial
park) we could use a combination of the names, whether the plant was a production plant
(all WMS plants produce goods, whereas this is not the case in the IEB) and the number of
employees at the plant (available in both datasets) to cleanly identify the IEB-WMS
matches.
Data at the firm level is at a higher level of aggregation than the establishment. Just as
multiple plants can belong to a single establishment, multiple establishments can below to
a single firm. Accounting data on sales, investment and intermediate inputs is only
available at the firm level. Hence, when running production functions or TFP equations we
should be aware that the accounting measures are only for firm-wide quantities. In the
WMS, respondents were encouraged to think of the firm as a whole when answering the
questions rather than just their plant. Nevertheless, even if the manager found his plant’s
practices the most salient in the interview, the management score is still the best predictor
of firm-level average practices. In the few cases when we had multiple
plants/establishments in the same firm we averaged the responses.

APPENDIX B1: MANAGEMENT PRACTICES QUESTIONNAIRE
Any score from 1 to 5 can be given, but the scoring guide and examples are only provided for scores of 1, 3 and 5. The survey also includes a set of Questions that
are asked to score each dimension, which are included in Bloom and Van Reenen (2007).
(1) Modern manufacturing, introduction
Scoring grid:

Score 1
Other than Just-In-Time (JIT) delivery from
suppliers few modern manufacturing
techniques have been introduced, (or have
been introduced in an ad-hoc manner)

Score 3
Some aspects of modern manufacturing
techniques have been introduced, through
informal/isolated change programs

Score 5
All major aspects of modern manufacturing have been
introduced (Just-In-Time, autonomation, flexible
manpower, support systems, attitudes and behaviour) in
a formal way

(2) Modern manufacturing, rationale
Score 1
Scoring grid:

Modern manufacturing techniques were
introduced because others were using them.

(4) Performance tracking
Scoring grid:

(5) Performance review
Scoring grid:

Score 5

Modern manufacturing techniques were
introduced to reduce costs

Modern manufacturing techniques were introduced to
enable us to meet our business objectives (including
costs)

Score 1
No, process improvements are made when
problems occur.

Score 3
Improvements are made in one week
workshops involving all staff, to improve
performance in their area of the plant

Score 5
Exposing problems in a structured way is integral to
individuals’ responsibilities and resolution occurs as a
part of normal business processes rather than by
extraordinary effort/teams

Score 1
Measures tracked do not indicate directly if
overall business objectives are being met.
Tracking is an ad-hoc process (certain
processes aren’t tracked at all)

Score 3
Most key performance indicators are tracked
formally. Tracking is overseen by senior
management.

Score 5
Performance is continuously tracked and communicated,
both formally and informally, to all staff using a range of
visual management tools.

Score 1
Performance is reviewed infrequently or in
an un-meaningful way, e.g. only success or
failure is noted.

Score 3
Performance is reviewed periodically with
successes and failures identified. Results are
communicated to senior management. No
clear follow-up plan is adopted.

Score 5
Performance is continually reviewed, based on indicators
tracked. All aspects are followed up ensure continuous
improvement. Results are communicated to all staff

(3) Process problem documentation
Scoring grid:

Score 3

55

(6) Performance dialogue
Scoring grid:

Score 1
The right data or information for a
constructive discussion is often not present
or conversations overly focus on data that is
not meaningful. Clear agenda is not known
and purpose is not stated explicitly

Score 3
Review conversations are held with the
appropriate data and information present.
Objectives of meetings are clear to all
participating and a clear agenda is present.
Conversations do not, as a matter of course,
drive to the root causes of the problems.

Score 5
Regular review/performance conversations focus on
problem solving and addressing root causes. Purpose,
agenda and follow-up steps are clear to all. Meetings are
an opportunity for constructive feedback and coaching.

Score 1
Failure to achieve agreed objectives does
not carry any consequences

Score 3
Failure to achieve agreed results is tolerated
for a period before action is taken.

Score 5
A failure to achieve agreed targets drives retraining in
identified areas of weakness or moving individuals to
where their skills are appropriate

Score 1
Goals are exclusively financial or
operational

Score 3
Goals include non-financial targets, which
form part of the performance appraisal of top
management only (they are not reinforced
throughout the rest of organization)

Score 5
Goals are a balance of financial and non-financial
targets. Senior managers believe the non-financial
targets are often more inspiring and challenging than
financials alone.

Score 1
Goals are based purely on accounting
figures (with no clear connection to
shareholder value)

Score 3
Corporate goals are based on shareholder
value but are not clearly communicated
down to individuals

Score 5
Corporate goals focus on shareholder value. They
increase in specificity as they cascade through business
units ultimately defining individual performance
expectations.

Score 1
Top management's main focus is on short
term targets

Score 3
There are short and long-term goals for all
levels of the organization. As they are set
independently, they are not necessarily
linked to each other

Score 5
Long term goals are translated into specific short term
targets so that short term targets become a "staircase" to
reach long term goals

Score 3
In most areas, top management pushes for
aggressive goals based on solid economic
rationale. There are a few "sacred cows" that
are not held to the same rigorous standard

Score 5
Goals are genuinely demanding for all divisions. They
are grounded in solid, solid economic rationale

(7) Consequence management
Scoring grid:
(8) Target balance
Scoring grid:

(9) Target interconnection
Scoring grid:

(10) Target time horizon
Scoring grid:
