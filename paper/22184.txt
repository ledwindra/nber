ABSTRACT
The U.S. Civil War and emancipation wiped out a substantial fraction of southern wealth. The
prevailing view of most economic historians, however, is that the southern planter elite was able
to retain its relative status despite these shocks. Previous studies have been hampered, however,
by limits on the ability to link individuals between census years, and have been forced to focus on
persistence within one or a few counties. Recent advances in electronic access to the Federal
Census manuscripts now make it possible to link individuals without these constraints. We
exploit the ability to search the full manuscript census to construct a sample that links top wealth
holders in 1870 to their 1860 census records. Although there was an entrenched southern planter
elite that retained their economic status, we find evidence that the turmoil of 1860s opened
greater opportunities for mobility in the South than was the case in the North, resulting in much
greater turnover among wealthy southerners than among comparably wealthy northerners.

The U.S. Civil War and emancipation wiped out a substantial fraction of southern
wealth. The prevailing view of most economic historians, however, is that the
southern planter elite was able to retain its relative status despite these shocks.
Previous studies have been hampered, however, by limits on the ability to link
individuals between census years, and have been forced to focus on persistence within
one or a few counties. Recent advances in electronic access to the Federal Census
manuscripts now make it possible to link individuals without these constraints. We
exploit the ability to search the full manuscript census to construct a sample that links
top wealth holders in 1870 to their 1860 census records. Although there was an
entrenched southern planter elite that retained their economic status, we find
evidence that the turmoil of 1860s opened greater opportunities for mobility in the
South than was the case in the North, resulting in much greater turnover among
wealthy southerners than among comparably wealthy northerners.
1. Introduction
The Civil War and emancipation represent major turning points in the history of

the United States. For scholars seeking to understand the consequences of the war, a
central question has been whether the southern economic elite was able to retain its

status and economic influence after the war, or was displaced by wartime destruction
and the end of slavery. Some early scholarship concluded that since the plantation

system disappeared after 1867, the war must have uprooted the Southern planter elite.
This idea seems to have originated in an 1881 article by Henry W. Grady, which was

later cited by Hammond (1897) in his well-known history of the cotton industry, and

persisted well into the twentieth century. Buck (1937, p. 145), for example, concludes
that “The small, rich landowning aristocracy in whose interest so much of Southern
energy had been expended was deprived of its privileged position.” By this time,

1

however, other scholars had begun to challenge the view that the war had displaced
the antebellum elite. Shugg (1937), for example, concluded, from an examination of
Louisiana tax records, that the plantation system was not destroyed by the war and
that land ownership actually became more concentrated after the war. 1

The most influential modern works on the subject are Jonathan Weiner’s (1976,

1979) studies using census data for five Alabama counties. Using the manuscript

census to trace the fortunes of the planter elite, Weiner found that 43 percent of the

236 largest landholders in the Alabama black belt in 1860 remained among the planter
elite in 1870. Noting that this rate of persistence rate was quite close to the 47 percent
that prevailed from 1850 to 1860 period, Weiner concluded that the evidence

supported Shugg’s view that the wealthy planter elite held a greater share of real

estate value in those counties after the war than it had before. Ransom and Sutch
(1977) concurred, arguing that landownership was quite stable even though the

number of farms in the five cotton states increased by 52 percent between 1860 and
1870, and that the percent of improved land over 100 acres fell from 81 percent in

1860 to 60 percent in 1870. 2 In a parallel study using data from one Texas county,

Campbell (1982) analyzed population persistence over the 1850 to 1880 period and

concluded that the rate of geographical persistence was fairly high among planters of
Interestingly, Woodward (1951) cited Shugg’s observation that northern
corporations purchased Louisiana sugar plantations in support of his argument that
there was a revolution in land ownership after the war. However, as Wiener (1976)
pointed out, Shugg also argued that there was no such change in ownership for the
cotton plantations. According to Shugg (1968, p. 246), the available evidence on cotton
plantations “argues against any sudden or sweeping overturn in ownership.”

all sizes: 43 percent of large planters persisted between 1860 and 1870, while poor

whites were the least persistent (only a 22 percent persistence rate). He also found

that while the planter elite suffered considerable economic losses during the Civil War
decade, they actually improved their relative position between 1860 and 1880.

Ransom (1989, p. 234) similarly concluded that even though the large farms were

broken up into smaller units, “land ownership in the South remained in the hands of
those who had owned land and slaves before the war.”

A crucial limitation of the work of Weiner, Campbell and others who have

looked at the effect of the Civil War on the southern elite has been the restricted

geographic scope of their analysis. On the one hand, this has meant assuming that

results for one or a few counties can be safely generalized to apply to the region as a

whole. On the other, given high rates of geographic mobility in the nineteenth century,
it has not been possible to establish whether individuals who moved out of the area

under study moved up or down, leaving open the possibility that any conclusions may
reflect the vagaries of sample selection. 3

Recent advances in electronic finding aids for historical censuses combined

with online access to complete census manuscripts for the entire country, both

available through the Ancestry.com website, allow us to improve on these earlier

studies by examining the wealth persistence across the 1860s for a nationwide sample

of individuals linked between 1860 and 1870 despite potential geographic mobility. In
Given the high rates of geographic mobility of wealthy planters before the Civil War,
there is good reason to be concerned about how to interpret the fate of those who
moved out of a confined geographic area in the 1860s. According to Oakes (1982, p.
77), “nearly sixty percent of the 1850 slaveholders [in Jasper County, Georgia] were
gone ten years later.” Schaefer (1985) found similarly high rates of geographic
mobility among slave owners between 1850 and 1860.

this article we analyze the origins of a sample of the wealthiest household heads in

1870 in both the South and the North.4 We find that although high levels of wealth

provided a considerable cushion against the shocks of the Civil War decade, the 1860s
were nonetheless characterized by a much higher degree of turnover among wealthy

southerners than among comparably wealthy northerners. Conventional accounts are
not wrong to emphasize the persistence of many wealthy southerners, but there is
considerable evidence that the turmoil of the Civil War and emancipation opened

greater opportunities for upward (and downward) mobility in the South than was the
case in the North.

Before turning to a description and analysis of the linked data we begin, in the

next section, with a brief introduction to the wealth data available in the Censuses of
1860 and 1870 and use these data to characterize the effects of the Civil War and
emancipation on regional wealth holding. Section 3 describes our procedure for

creating a linked sample beginning with high wealth individuals in 1870 and locating
them in the 1860 census, and section 4 describes what these linked data reveal. We
conclude with some additional interpretation of these results.

2. The Impact of the Civil War on Wealth Levels and Distribution
Both the 1860 and 1870 population censuses included questions about real and

personal property ownership. Along with the 1850 census, which collected data on real
property ownership, they constitute the only nationally representative data on

Because of the small numbers of individuals in the Mountain and Pacific Census
Divisions we exclude them from our analysis.

personal wealth levels prior to the late-20th century. Wealth levels in both census

years were self-reported, but a number of studies have confirmed their reliability.

Soltow (1975, p. 6) found that reported wealth levels in the 1850 to 1870 censuses
were “generally in line with estimates made by various authorities on wealth

distribution. Growth rates are similar to those found for GNP per worker by Kuznets

and commodity output per worker by Gallman.” Steckel (1990) pointed out that real

estate holdings cannot be easily concealed and were probably reliably reported. Even
if respondents could have concealed their wealth, Querubin and Snyder (2011, p. 65)
argued that they had no real incentives to do so because “even if some respondents

were worried that the information provided would not in fact be confidential, there
was no clear incentive for under-reporting or over-reporting wealth. There was no

federal tax on wealth at the time, and no estate tax. Personal vanity, however, might

have lead to some over-reporting.” Steckel (1994) showed that discrepancies between
local tax records and self-reported census wealth levels in Ohio and Massachusetts
were not systematically related to other socioeconomic indicators for the period

between 1820 and 1910. Galenson and Pope (1992, p. 227) also found that the self-

reported census wealth was highly correlated with local tax rolls, and they concluded
that “the wealth figures in the census manuscripts appear to be reasonably accurate

estimates of household wealth, even though they may not typically have been based on
detailed calculations of household wealth.”

Although Census officials at the time and some later scholars have expressed

concern about the quality of the 1870 census enumeration, arguing that there was

significant under count in this year, more recent analysis suggests that these concerns
5

are largely unfounded. 5 According to Hacker et al (1999, p.129), “the undercount
estimate given in the 1890 census report was greatly exaggerated as a result of a

failure to account for the magnitude of the negative demographic shock caused by the
Civil War. They point out that to arrive at the estimate of a 1.2 million person

undercount, the 1890 investigators had assumed that the South experienced steady

population growth between 1860 and 1880. Recent studies, however, have suggested

that the Civil War substantially slowed population growth in the 1860s relative to the
pace in the 1870s. Adopting a more realistic set of assumptions about the rate of

population increase in the 1860s implies an undercount of about 6.6 percent, not

significantly different from nonresponse rates in modern survey data (Hacker, 2013).

On this basis Hacker et al, argued that the “under enumeration of southern whites and
blacks in 1870 was far lower than 1890 investigators estimated. [The 1870 census]

will not pose a significant problem for most analyses.” 6 Whatever undercount issues
exist with the 1870 census are, in any case, likely to be less relevant for the present
study, since we focus on the top wealth holders whereas the undercount was most
significant for poorer and younger blacks in the South.

Tables 1 and 2 summarize regional property ownership patterns by region in

1860 and 1870, respectively based on data available in the Integrated Public Use

This concern originates with the Director of the 1870 Census, Francis Walker, who
believed that there had been a significant undercount of the population. As a result of
these concerns, President Grant ordered a recount in Philadelphia, New York, and
Indianapolis. These concerns were reiterated in the 1890 census and have been
accepted by many subsequent historians.
6 Ransom and Sutch (1975) estimated that the black undercount was about 6.6
percent.

Microdata Series (IPUMS) 1-in-100 random sample of the Census (Ruggles 2015). 7

Because there are only a small number of observations from the Mountain and Pacific

Census divisions we have dropped these regions from our analysis. We further restrict
our sample to household heads. Since more than 90 percent of property ownership
reported in the two censuses was attributed to household heads, inclusion of non-

heads would simply increase the apparent inequity of the distribution without yielding
additional insight. Within each region, we have sorted household heads by their

percentile rank based on total property wealth. In the tables, we report a number of

statistics characterizing property ownership by percentile groups. The first five rows

of each table report the following values for each group: the number of observations in
the IPUMS; median values for real property, personal property, and total property

wealth; and the average share of real property in total wealth. The remaining rows

report a number of demographic and occupational characteristics. The first column for
each region shows characteristics of the bottom 55 percent of wealth holders. We

selected this cut-off because the bottom 55 percent of household heads reported no
real or personal property ownership in 1870. The subsequent columns show
characteristics for higher wealth groups.

The 1860 data illustrate in striking detail the enormous fortunes that the slave

system permitted the wealthiest southerners to accumulate. The median wealth
reported by those between the 99th and 100th percentile of southern wealth

distribution in 1860 was a staggering $122,250, more than three times the median

wealth of the top 1 percent of northerners. Indeed, the median wealth of the richest

northerners was comparable to the median for those between the 95th and 99th
percentiles in the South. In an economy that was still predominantly rural and

agricultural, slavery eliminated the labor constraints that limited the size of northern
farms and allowed for a much greater concentration of wealth (Wright 1970, 1978;

Ransom 1989). As Williamson and Cain (2010) put it, “The total estate for those in the
upper tail of the [wealth] distribution was enormous. It should be emphasized,

however, that this is not a small elite; as a group, slave owners were sizeable and
wealthy.”

The impact of slave wealth in the South is also apparent in the much lower

share of real property in total wealth compared to the North. In the North, real estate

was the principal vehicle of wealth accumulation, accounting for two-thirds or more of

property ownership among the top 45 percent of wealth holders. In contrast, personal
property (which included slaves) made up close to three-fifths of wealth in the top 10
percent of the Southern wealth distribution and was still about half of total property
wealth for those between the 55th and 90th percentiles.

Comparing Table 2 with Table 1, it is evident how large an impact the Civil War

and emancipation had on southern wealth holders. 8 Given the prominent role of

slaves among the property of the wealthiest southerners, it is reasonable to conjecture

that the effects of emancipation may have been most pronounced at the top of the

It is worth noting that the war itself was enormously costly for the nation as a whole,
but disproportionately so for the South. Goldin and Lewis (1975) estimated that the
war cost $75 per capita for the North and $451 for the South. The human cost was also
considerably higher: 2.8 percent of the South’s population was killed in the war
compared to 1.5 percent of the North’s population (Goldin, 1980, p. 938).

wealth distribution. 9 While northern wealth holders above the 55th percentile

experienced an approximately 50 percent increase in property holding over the 1860s,
the value of property owned by southerners fell by nearly 75 percent. The drop was
especially pronounced for personal property; above the 90th percentile, southern

wealth holders experienced a 90 percent drop in the value of personal property, while
real property wealth was cut approximately in half. As a result, after the war the

relative shares of real and personal property in the South converged toward those in
the North, with real property making up 60-70 percent of wealth, at least among the
wealthier household heads.

Tables 1 and 2 also reveal a number of other notable regional differences over

the decade. Women made up a relatively small share of household heads in both

regions and in both census years. However, women represented a larger fraction of
wealth holders in the South both before and after the Civil War, and there was a

noticeable increase in the female share of heads of household among the poorest

households after the war. In the South in 1860, 84.7 percent of households below the

55th percentile of the wealth distribution had male heads, but that number dropped to

only 79.6 percent in the 1870 census. We suspect this is driven by the presence of war

widows in the South, where an estimated one out of five white men of military age died

in the war. 10

The elimination of slave wealth also had dramatic implications for the economic
institutions that emerged during Reconstruction. Since slaves could no longer be used
as collateral to secure credit, the “pawn-shop economy” of the furnishing merchants
stepped into the breach (Ransom and Sutch, 1977). Moreover, Wright (1986) argued
that massive shift in the basis of southern wealth transformed wealthy southerners
from “laborlords” to “landlords.”
10 For more on southern war widows, see Hacker et al (2010) and Faust (2004).

In the North, the likelihood that an individual was living outside of his or her

state of birth diminished as wealth levels increased. In both 1860 and 1870 close to

two-thirds of northerners below the 55th percentile were living outside their state of

birth, a proportion that fell to around 50 percent at the top of the wealth distribution.
In the South, geographic mobility was markedly lower among those at the bottom of
the wealth distribution, and there is no clear relationship between wealth and

geographic mobility. The proportion of high wealth household heads living outside
their state of birth was roughly similar to that for lower wealth household heads.

In both regions, rural residents outnumbered urban dwellers, but residence

patterns looked rather different across wealth strata. In the North, the percent urban

followed an inverted-U pattern in both 1860 and 1870, with the rural shares lowest at

the bottom and top of the wealth distribution. As Rosenbloom and Stutes (2008) noted
in their analysis of 1870 wealth data, inequality increased with urbanization. There

was, however, a noticeable decline in rural residents over the course of the decade at
all wealth levels. This decline was especially pronounced among the wealthiest 1
percent of Northerners, where the proportion rural fell from 53.4 percent to 39.2

percent over the decade. The proportion rural was consistently higher in the South,

and, there was little variation across the wealth distribution in 1860. By 1870, perhaps
reflecting the beginnings of a shift away from agriculture as the source of regional

wealth in the South, the top 1 percent of southern wealth holders were much more
likely to be urban residents than was the case ten years earlier.

The bottom rows in each table report the occupational distribution within each

wealth stratum using the IPUMS standardized 1950 occupational codes. Farmers

10

dominated the top of the southern wealth distribution in both 1860 and 1870, but
white-collar jobs were much more important at the top of the northern wealth

distribution. There were some notable changes in occupational composition across the
wealth distribution over the Civil War decade. Most notably, and consistent with the

rise in urbanization among top wealth holders in the South, the share of farmers in the
top two strata fell, while the numbers of professional & technical and clerical &
managerial occupations rose.

3. Creating a Linked Sample
The cross-sectional evidence presented so far is sufficient to establish that there

were important regional differences in wealth holding, and that the Civil War and

emancipation produced large shocks to wealth holding, especially in the South. They
cannot, however, reveal what happened to individuals during the 1860s. Were the

wealthiest southerners able to retain their relative position in the wealth distribution

despite the absolute loss of wealth during the 1860s? Or did the shock of the war and
emancipation cause those at the top to fall down the wealth distribution and allow

those further down to rise up? As our earlier review of the literature suggests, answers
to these questions have varied over time and have been limited in their generality by

data constraints. Resolving this question requires following the fortunes of individuals
over the course of the decade. Past efforts to do this have focused on following

individuals within a limited area; however, as we describe in this section, we are now
able to construct a nationally representative linked sample that is not constrained to
the geographically immobile.

11

To explore the impact of the Civil War decade on individual fortunes, we have

created a linked sample by starting with those at the top of the wealth distribution in
each region (North and South) in 1870 and attempting to locate them in the 1860
census. As such, this approach answers the question: where did the wealthiest

household heads in each region in 1870 come from? Working backward has the virtue
that we do not have to contend with the problem of failure to link individuals because
of mortality. 11

To construct our linked sample, we used the IPUMS to identify household heads

with total 1870 property holdings that placed them among the top 5 percent in each
region. Since it is still necessary to hand-collect the linked data, we chose the top 5

percent to provide a large enough sample of linked individuals for regional differences

to be visible, while keeping the data collection effort manageable. For 1870, the IPUMS
has collected both a 1 percent random sample and a black oversample, referred to as
the 1.2 percent sample. 12 In hopes of increasing the size of our initial sample of

wealthy individuals we have drawn them from the 1.2 percent sample. To increase the
chances of linking backward we restricted our analysis to household heads 25 and

older, and to avoid the distorting effects of wealth transfers in old age, we imposed an

upper limit of 75 years. This procedure generated a sample of 4,419 household heads
An alternative to the approach we have taken would be to begin with the wealthiest
individuals in 1860 and link them forward. As with the backward linkage approach we
have taken, this method would yield insight about the degree of turnover among the
wealthiest households, but would in addition shed light on what happened to those at
the top of the wealth distribution at the beginning of the decade.
12 For 1860 and 1870 the IPUMS 1.2% sample includes an oversample of households
containing one or more blacks. While non-black households are sampled to produce a
1-in-100 sample of the population, households with black members were sampled at a
rate of 1-in-50.
11

12

(2,520 and in the North and 1,899 in the South) to be linked backward to the 1860
census.

We then searched for each of the individuals in our sample in the 1860 census

using the Ancestry.com database based on first and last name, and year of birth

calculated from reported age in 1870.13 The search engine on this site allows for

variant spellings and provides a list of individuals ranked by the quality of the match to
the information entered. To qualify as a link, the individual located in the 1860 census
had to have approximately the same first and last names and a birth year within 2

years of that recorded in 1870. In cases where the linkage was ambiguous because
there were multiple individuals meeting these criteria, we used place of birth to

distinguish between the potential matches. If, at this point, there were still multiple
potential matches we did not record a link. For each linked individual we noted

several aspects of link quality, including whether the place of birth was the same in

both censuses, and whether we were able to identify other household members in both
censuses. We did not, however, use information about other household members to
determine which links to record because of the potential sampling bias that this
criterion would introduce.

The results of our search are summarized in Table 3. In total we were

successful in linking 1,918 individuals, a success rate of 43 percent. Based on

indicators of link quality, our confidence in the linkage process is quite high. In all but
51 cases, place of birth was identical in both censuses, and in 85 percent of cases we
were able to find other household members (a spouse and/or child) that matched

13

13

across the two censuses. Our linkage rate appears to be considerably higher than
other studies that have sought to link nineteenth century census records. Ferrie

(1996), for example, reports a success rate of just under 20 percent when linking
forward from the 1850 to the 1860 census. The relatively high rate of success in

linking in our sample likely reflects the greater stability of high wealth individuals.

Backward linkage also eliminates the negative effects of mortality on linkage. 14 This is

especially important in light of evidence that approximately 8 percent of white males
between ages 13 and 43 (in 1860) died in the war. 15

Table 3 also reports a number of characteristics of the linked and unlinked

individuals. The final two columns of the table report differences in mean values

between the linked and unlinked samples and their significance levels. It is apparent
that a number of these characteristics differed significantly between the linked and

unlinked individuals. Linked individuals were, on average, 4 years older than those we
failed to link. This may be because of the difficulty of locating records for younger

individuals in 1860, especially if they were living in households headed by others.

They also reported higher levels of property ownership, were more likely to be living
in their state of birth, and were less likely to be foreign born. In addition, there was a

strong regional differential in the likelihood of linkage, with northerners more likely to
be linked than southerners. In contrast to the association of a number of personal

One study that used a backward linkage approach similar to ours was Schaefer
(1985). He also found a high linkage rate of approximately 50 percent between the
1860 and 1850 censuses.
15 The estimated death rate is from Vinovskis (1989, p. 38). Previous studies (Wiener,
1976; Campbell, 1982) have recognized death as a factor in non-persistence and
typically look for potential heirs, but this approach is obviously limited in cases where
there were no surviving heirs.
14

14

characteristics with the likelihood of linkage, the overall occupational distributions

across the linked and unlinked groups was quite similar: close to 40 percent of both

groups were farmers and another quarter were in clerical and managerial positions.

It is worth noting that about 7 percent of the top wealth holders we identified in

1870 were women. While the potential for name changes means that it is more

difficult generally to locate women across census years, we have attempted to do so

here and, as Table 3 indicates, women were only slightly less likely to be linked than
men in our sample. In measuring 1860 wealth for women recorded in 1870 as

household heads, we have attributed to them the sum of any property attributed to
them in 1860 and any property owned by their husband at that time.
4. Assessing Wealth Mobility in the 1860s
The decade of the 1860s was characterized by substantial economic disruptions

in both northern and southern states. In the South, the war resulted in property

destruction and ended with the emancipation of the slave population, wiping out the
largest component of southern wealth. In the North, the interruption of cotton

shipments affected the textile industry, while the demands of raising and supplying the
Union Army created opportunities for enterprising businessmen. How did these

events affect wealth holders in both regions? Were the effects of wartime disruptions
more concentrated in the South? Or were southern wealth holders able to hold onto
their economic power despite the significant reductions in total wealth caused by
emancipation?

15

As we have noted, during the 1860s average wealth levels decreased

substantially in the South, but increased in the North. So it makes the most sense to

consider the question of wealth stability in relative terms within each region. Table 4
summarizes information about transitions in wealth strata in each region over the

decade of the 1860s. The rows of each table indicate the location in the 1860 wealth

distribution, while columns correspond to 1870 wealth levels. To locate individuals in
the 1860 wealth distribution we have used percentile cut-offs for total property

ownership in each region calculated from the IPUMS 1 percent sample. In the lower

panel of the table, we report the value of each cell as a percentage of the column total.
Comparing the two regions, it is apparent that there was considerably more

turnover among the ranks of top southern wealth holders than among northern wealth
holders. While more than half of the those in the top 5 percent of northern wealth
holders had been in the same group in 1860 just one-third of top southern wealth

holders in 1870 had enjoyed a similar status in 1860. Roughly the same proportion of
the top 5 percent in each region was drawn from the next stratum of wealth holders in

1860 (90th to 95th percentile). On the other hand, our data suggest that the turmoil of
the Civil War decade created much greater opportunities for those with moderate

wealth in 1860 – between the 55th and 90th percentiles - to move up to the top of the

wealth distribution. Nearly 40 percent of the wealthiest southerners in 1870 had been
in this group in 1860, compared to less than one quarter of the richest northerners.

One concern in interpreting the results in Table 4 is that they may be influenced

by differences in sample composition across regions. As noted earlier, the probability
of linkage varied systematically with a number of personal characteristics, and it is

16

possible that these differences affected differences in measured persistence. To test
this hypothesis, we report the results of estimating a probit regression where the

dependent variable takes the value 1 if the individual was in the top 5 percent of their
region’s wealth holders in 1860, and zero if the individual moved up from outside the
top 5 percent in 1860. The first specification includes only a constant and a zero-one
indicator variable for 1870 region of residence. The second specification adds a

quadratic in age as well as indicators for foreign born and living in 1870 outside the

individual’s state of birth. In the final specification, we add indicators for whether the

individual’s household includes a spouse or child. While several of these variables are
statistically significant, they have little impact on the magnitude of the 1870 region of

residence on persistence among the top wealth holders. With or without demographic
controls, the regression estimates imply that 1870 residence in the North increased

the probability that a top wealth holder had been among the top 5 percent in 1860 by
close to 20 percentage points.

In addition to wealth mobility, the data we have collected on top wealth holders

in 1870 allow us to evaluate the geographic mobility of this elite group. Only a very

few of these wealthy individuals migrated between regions in the 1860s: only 18 (5
percent) of top southern wealth holders and 9 (1.1 percent) of top northern wealth

holders had lived in a different region 10 years earlier. As Table 6 shows, interstate
migration was also relatively uncommon, but somewhat more likely in the South.
Among top wealth holders in 1870, 12.5 percent of those in the South had moved
across state lines in the previous decade, while the corresponding figure for the

wealthiest northerners was 9.3 percent.

5. Conclusion
For the United States the 1860s were a period of pronounced economic turmoil

resulting from a major war and the politically imposed end of slavery. These shocks

created huge economic losses in the South, but must also have offered opportunities to
profit in the region for those adept enough to respond to changing conditions.
Similarly, economic shocks to the northern economy should have created

opportunities to profit. In the aggregate, the events of the 1860s resulted in

substantial declines in measured wealth in the South and large increases in wealth

holding in the North. Views about how this turmoil affected those at the top of the

southern economy have differed. Beginning in the late nineteenth-century, historians

emphasized the turnover in southern economic elites, arguing that the Civil War wiped
out the planter class and created a new elite. More recently, however, scholarly views
have shifted, arguing that persistence rates at the top were no different in the 1860s

than they had been in the more peaceful 1850s.

By using the Ancestry.com database we are able to improve on past efforts to

link wealthy individuals across census years. Where previous studies have been
confined to a few counties, we are able to study a random sample of wealthy

individuals in all locations and link them across census years regardless of geographic
mobility. Like previous scholars, we too find that there was considerable persistence
among wealth southerners: 45 percent of those in the top 5 percent of property

owners 1870 had been among the top 10 percent of property holders in 1860. But the
rate of persistence in the South was considerably lower than it was in the North over

18

the decade of the 1860s. In the North, almost 61 percent of those in the top 5 percent
of wealth holders in 1870 had begun the decade in the top 10 percent. Thus, while
wealth provided insulation from the shocks of the 1860s, it was a less effective
insulator in the South than in the North.

For those interested in the impact of the Civil War and emancipation on the

economic development of the postbellum South, the results reported here require

some revision of widely accepted views. While there was undoubtedly an entrenched

southern elite that held onto economic status and power, it also appears that the 1860s
introduced considerably greater levels of turnover in the South than in other parts of

the United States. Collection of additional data will be required to determine whether

these regional differences existed in the 1850s as well, or if the Civil War was the cause
of this difference.

More generally, our findings that the Civil War led to higher rates of wealth

mobility in the South have salience for discussions of the dynamics of wealth and

income inequality. Prompted in part by the well-publicized work of Thomas Piketty

(2014), economists have evidenced a renewed interest in this topic recently. Piketty

has argued that capitalist economies are characterized by long-run tendencies toward
increasing concentration of wealth and income, but that in the twentieth century the

forces of concentration were significantly obscured by the massive disruptions caused
by the two World Wars and the Great Depression. A number of other studies have

explored the long-run persistence of social and economic status. Clark (2014) makes
use of differences in the frequency of family names among elite groups to argue that

social status is highly persistent over long time periods. Long and Ferrie (2013), using
19

linked census data for the Unites States to trace patterns of occupational mobility,

concluded that rates of mobility have declined since the nineteenth century. But less
attention has been devoted to the way in which economic and political shocks may

affect the persistence of social status. The evidence presented here adds support for

the view that major political shocks can disrupt the normal accumulation of assets and
cause greater wealth mobility, at least among those on the losing end of these shocks.
