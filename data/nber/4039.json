It is argued that flexibility can in general only be defined relative to the exogenous changes that occur. Using a dual approach, measures of flexibility in response to the particular exogenous shock are developed. In addition, a decomposition of the total change in National Income into its component parts including gains due to flexibility or losses due to inflexibility is developed.\n\n",
