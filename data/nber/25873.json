    "abstract": "\n\nWe use the universe of de-identi\ufb01ed and geocoded cellphone records for 1.8 million individuals from a major Chinese telecommunication provider to examine the role of information exchange in urban labor markets. Information \ufb02ow, as measured by call volume, correlates strongly with worker \ufb02ows at di\ufb00erent levels of geographic aggregation. Having a referral in a location increases by close to four times the likelihood that a job switcher moves there. Di\ufb00erent from the communication pattern between nonreferral pairs, communication between referral pairs exhibits a distinct inverted-U shape that peaks prior to the job switch. Compared with our referral measure, the commonly-used social network proxies deliver a lower bound estimate of the referral e\ufb00ect. We supplement the phone records with administrative data on \ufb01rm attributes and auxiliary data on job postings and residential housing prices. Referred jobs are associated with higher monetary gains, a higher likelihood to transition from part time to full time, reduced commuting time, and a higher probability of entering desirable jobs. Referral information is more valuable for young workers, people switching jobs from suburbs to the inner city, and those changing their industrial sectors. Firms receiving referred workers are associated with more successful recruits, higher matching rates and faster growth.\n\n",
