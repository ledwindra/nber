ABSTRACT
Global climate change and other environmental challenges require the development of new energy
technologies with lower emissions. In the near-term, R&D investments, either by government or the
private sector, can bring down the costs of these lower emission technologies. However, the results of
R&D are uncertain, and there are many potential technologies that may turn out to play an effective role
in the future energy mix. In this paper, we address the problem of allocating R&D across technologies
under uncertainty. Specifically, given two technologies, one with lower costs at present, but the other
with greater uncertainty in the returns to R&D, how should one allocate the R&D budget? We develop
a multi-stage stochastic dynamic programming version of an integrated assessment model of climate
and economy that represents endogenous technological change through R&D decisions for two
substitutable non-carbon backstop technologies. Using the model, we demonstrate that near-term
R&D into the higher cost technology is justified, and that the amount of R&D into the high cost
technology increases with both the variance in the uncertainty in returns to R&D and with the skewness
of the uncertainty. We also present an illustrative case study of wind and solar photovoltaic technologies,
and show that poor R&D results in early periods do not necessarily mean that investment should not
continue.

1. Introduction
A response to global climate change will necessarily include reducing the carbon
emissions from energy production in the future. There are many potential fuels and technologies
that may contribute to future energy production with lower greenhouse gas emissions. For
electric power, candidates include nuclear power, carbon capture and sequestration from coal or
natural gas combustion, solar power (photovoltaic (PV) or concentrated solar thermal), wind
power (on-shore or off-shore), and biomass-fueled combustion. Similarly, for transportation
lower carbon technologies include efficient diesel engines, electric vehicles, hybrid electric
vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, and biofuels.
Potential low carbon technologies vary widely in their current relative costs,
technological maturity, and commercial viability. One current policy challenge is how to
efficiently allocate scarce resources for research and development (R&D) across different
technologies. Public and private entities that fund R&D must choose how to allocate their efforts
among these disparate technologies. For example, in the U.S., the Department of Energy (DOE)
is a major source of public funding for energy R&D (DOE, 2015). Each year, DOE allocates
funding for R&D across technology areas as part of their input into the budget and
appropriations process. However, there is limited objective or quantitative guidance for agencies
on how to choose among possible allocations (Pugh et al., 2011).
To focus the discussion, consider the simple case of two low-carbon energy technologies
that are relatively easily substitutable. Although no technology is a perfect substitute for
another, the ease of substitution in some circumstances may be significant. For example, solar
PV and on-shore wind power constitute one such pair within the electric power system. Both are
intermittent renewable sources of electricity that emit no carbon. Although their relative

1

potential in any specific location may vary depending on the solar and wind resource that exists,
they play a similar role within the power system. Other possible examples include nuclear
power and coal-fired electricity with carbon capture for electricity production (both are baseload
technologies), or hybrid, battery electric, and CNG vehicles for transportation.
In each of these examples, one technology is currently significantly lower cost than the
alternative(s). For example, the 2015 estimates of levelized cost from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration is $73.6 per MWh (2012 U.S. $) for on-shore wind as compared to
$125.3 per MWh for solar PV (EIA, 2015). In this case, solar PV is still higher cost than wind
despite decades of significant public and private R&D in many industrialized countries into solar
PV technology, which has lowered its costs by several orders of magnitude (Barbose et al.,
2014). A reasonable question, therefore, is whether continued R&D investments in solar PV are
justified and at what level of funding, given that wind is lower cost and can fill a similar niche.
This question, as applied to solar, has become particularly relevant since the high-profile
bankruptcies of two solar technology companies in the U.S. that had received substantial public
investment. Solyndra, a California-based company that manufactured solar panels, received
$539 million in guaranteed government loans in 2009, but by August 2011 had gone bankrupt
(Weiner, 2012). Around the same time, Evergreen Solar, a Massachusetts-based solar panel
manufacturer also declared bankruptcy (Church, 2011). In both cases, the reasons for the firms’
failures were due to a number of factors, but certainly include competition from lower-cost
manufacturers in China. Nevertheless, these failures have been cited in debates over public
R&D, and some continue to argue that further investments in solar technology are not costeffective (e.g., U.S. News & World Report, 2012), or at least that public investment in solar
should be scaled back.

2

In this motivating example of wind vs solar PV, a critical factor is that uncertainty in the
returns from R&D into solar is likely to be highly skewed, and more skewed than for wind, the
more commercially established technology. For example, Baker et al. (2009a) performed an
expert elicitation of the uncertainty in the results of solar R&D with several technology experts,
and the resulting distributions are in fact highly skewed. In the past decade, numerous
potentially revolutionary technologies for PV have been identified (e.g., Green, 2000) and much
R&D invested by programs such as Sunshot within the U.S. Department of Energy (Sunshot,
2012), including advanced materials and manufacturing processes. In the past several years,
prices have in fact declined sharply, but the cost reductions are primarily due to other factors
such as economies of scale in production rather than new advanced materials (Barbose et al.,
2014). Does this mean that these recent R&D investments were not wise, given the information
available, or that continued investments are not warranted? Or do the results of solar R&D to
date merely reflect a highly skewed distribution of uncertain returns, and is continued R&D still
optimal?
In this paper, we investigate the factors that influence the economically efficient
allocation of R&D investment across two substitutable energy technologies. In particular, we
focus on the question: under what circumstances should we allocate some R&D to a higher-cost
technology, when a lower cost substitute exists? Further, how should the allocation change if
R&D into the higher-cost technology has uncertain and positively skewed returns? Here, we
explicitly consider R&D as a stochastic process. Uncertainty is a central feature of R&D
processes, since a priori one does not know what will be obtained from a given level of
investment. Moreover, the relevant features of the uncertainty include more than simply mean
and variance. Some technologies may have very low probability of a significant cost reduction

3

and very high probability of little or no cost reduction; this implies skewness in the distribution.
When decision-makers must allocate R&D among technologies with qualitatively different risk
profiles (e.g., more skewed but lower mean vs. less skewed and higher mean), how should this
allocation be made? Using our stochastic framework, we demonstrate the influence of the shape
of the probability distribution of uncertain returns to R&D on the optimal level of R&D
investment into the higher-cost technology.
Numerous studies exist that have addressed the empirical, theoretical, and applied
numerical modeling of innovation and the R&D process. Several excellent reviews exist (e.g.,
Pizer and Popp, 2008; Gillingham et al., 2008; Loschel, 2002, Popp, Newell, and Jaffe, 2010), so
we only briefly review the most relevant studies here. Many theoretical and numerical models
assume an innovation possibilities frontier (IPF) (Kennedy, 1964; Kamien and Schwartz, 1968;
Acemoglu, 2002), which is a function of the stock of “knowledge capital” (Romer, 1990;
Acemoglu, 1998). Examples of numerical models that include endogenous directed
technological change include Popp (2004), Popp (2006), Buonanno et al. (2003), Sue Wing
(2006), Goulder and Schneider (1999), and Goulder and Mathai (2000). The majority of these
models are deterministic, and focus on specific questions such as the welfare gain from including
endogenous technological change when there is a climate policy target (e.g., Popp, 2004;
Buonanno et al., 2003; Goulder and Mathai, 2000), the relative impacts of various policy
instruments on inducing innovation (e.g., Fischer et al., 2013; Fischer and Newell, 2008), the
impact on optimal R&D of uncertainty in the extent of climate change (e.g., Baker et al., 2006),
and the effect on R&D of spillovers across countries (e.g., Bosetti et al., 2009).
Some studies have directly addressed the uncertainty in the returns to R&D, but have
tended to focus on R&D into a single backstop that substitutes for a conventional (i.e., fossil)

4

energy source. Theoretical models of optimal R&D under uncertainty include Hung and Quyen
(1993), who showed that uncertainty can delay R&D and accelerate conventional resource
depletion under some conditions, and Tsur and Zemel (2005), who explored a range of dynamic
growth paths with and without R&D and showed that the growth path depends on the type of
economy. Goeschl and Perino (2009) present a model in which the backstop technology has
uncertain environmental characteristics in a multi-pollutant context, but deterministic cost
impacts of R&D. Baker and Adu-Bonnah (2008) develop a two-stage stochastic model in which
the impacts of R&D are uncertain with a probability distribution over three possible cost
outcomes (target cost, breakthrough, or failure). They show that the effect of increasing the
mean-preserving variance on R&D investment is ambiguous, and depends on the type of
technology targeted. Bosetti and Tavoni (2009) present a stochastic two-stage version of the
WITCH model (Bosetti et al 2006) in which the investment cost of the backstop is drawn from a
symmetric distribution that depends on the cumulative knowledge stock. In contrast to Baker
and Adu-Bonnah (2008), they demonstrate from both an analytical model and from the
numerical model that uncertainty in the returns to R&D unambiguously increases the optimal
level of R&D.
There are fewer studies that explicitly consider multiple technologies and uncertainty.
One notable example is Gritsevski and Nakicenovic (2000), who considered more than 100
energy technologies within the MESSAGE model (Messner et al., 1996). However, their
approach is focused on learning-by-doing rather than explicit R&D. Using a large number of
scenarios of technology dynamics, they show that there are many distinct paths with similar
energy costs. Pugh et al (2011) also used a scenario-based approach to explore the energy R&D
portfolio question. Using results from a range of scenarios from the GCAM model (Brenkert et

5

al., 2003) to inform the benefits of different technologies and a probability distribution for the
likelihood of success of achieving the maximum emissions reductions, they develop example 5year R&D plans.
Most similarly to this study, Baker and Solak (2011) develop a two-stage (stage 1
chooses R&D and stage 2 chooses abatement) stochastic model with R&D into three alternative
backstop technologies: solar, coal with carbon capture, and nuclear. The probability
distributions for the uncertain returns to R&D are taken from expert elicitations of the
uncertainty in cost reductions from R&D into each of these technologies (Baker et al., 2008,
2009a, 2009b). In general, they find that the R&D portfolio is diverse across technologies and is
robust to the uncertainty in climate damages. However, they do not investigate the sensitivity to
different shapes of the distributions of uncertain returns to R&D, nor do they consider more than
two stages. Previous work (Webster et al., 2012) has shown that for some problems, multi-stage
(N > 2) may lead to very different stage 1 optimal strategies compared with two-stage
formulations.
Several questions and challenges remain unaddressed by the extant literature. First, given
two technologies with uncertain returns to R&D, how should R&D be allocated? In particular,
the relative impacts of mean, variance, and higher order moments in the distribution of uncertain
returns on the R&D allocation decision have not been methodically explored. Second, in a
multi-stage context with repeated opportunities for R&D and observed outcomes, what is the
conditionally optimal R&D, given failures in previous stages to reduce cost? Finally, a challenge
remains in calibrating models of technological change using the empirical literature in the
treatment of the depreciation or decay rate of the knowledge stock. Representations of the
Innovation Possibilities Frontier assume a depreciation rate, based on findings in the empirical

6

literature that knowledge decays over time in terms of its effectiveness at generating new
knowledge. However, a deficiency in current formulations is that they therefore assume that the
cost reductions achieved also decay, implying that costs increase over time without a minimum
threshold of new knowledge every period.
We build on the previous studies of optimal R&D under uncertainty to meet a climate
target by investigating the optimal ratio of R&D investment across two generic backstop
technologies. We develop a multi-stage stochastic dynamic model, based on ENTICE-BR
(Popp, 2006) with R&D-induced technological change by means of innovation possibilities
frontiers and cumulative knowledge capital stocks. Using this model, we explore the factors that
determine the relative magnitude of R&D investment that should be allocated to a higher cost
backstop when a lower cost technology exists. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of
varying the shape of the distribution of uncertain returns to R&D, and show that the optimal
R&D depends not only on the relative variance but also on the skewness of the distributions.
Our specific contributions are:
x

A model of multi-stage R&D decisions across two low-carbon backstop technologies under
uncertainty in returns to R&D;

x

A novel formulation of technological change that distinguishes between knowledge stocks
that generate new knowledge and those that generate perpetual cost reductions; and

x

Demonstration of the relative effects of variance of the distribution of uncertain returns,
skewness of the distribution, and initial relative costs of the backstops on the optimal R&D
ratio.

The results of the analysis contribute to the policy discussion over R&D portfolios by
demonstrating that for long-tailed (positively skewed) distributions, optimal R&D into the more

7

expensive backstop should be greater than for less skewed distributions, and that even belowaverage outcomes from first stage R&D into the high-cost technology does not mean that future
R&D should be focused exclusively on the lower cost technology.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we begin by presenting a simple
analytical two-stage model of R&D allocation under uncertainty. This model frames the
qualitative result that we later demonstrate with the numerical model. Section 3 presents the
methodology and key assumptions for the stochastic dynamic version of ENTICE-BR with two
substitutable backstops. We present the results from the numerical model in Section 4. Section
5 gives a concluding discussion.

2. R&D under Uncertainty and the effect of Skewness
To motivate and frame the numerical model and its results, we begin by illustrating the
concepts with a simple stylized analytical model. Although this model omits many features of
the problem to retain analytical tractability and transparency, we illustrate the key intuition. The
numerical model presented in the subsequent sections then includes many of the complicated
features omitted here, and produces qualitatively similar results.
Consider a two-stage model, t = 1, 2, and two possible backstop energy technologies, i
{1, 2}. In the first stage (t=1), the decision maker must choose the R&D investment levels into
each of the two technologies, R1, R2. For simplicity, assume that the total budget is exogenously
constrained:
R1 + R2 <= B,
and that the two technologies are perfect substitutes.

8

We denote the cost of technology i at time t by Cit. Assume that Technology 1 is lower
cost in the initial period than Technology 2:
C11 < C21
In this model, the cost in stage 2 can be reduced by R&D according to some increasing, concave
function f:
‫ܥ‬௜ଶ ൌ ‫ܥ‬௜ଵ െ ݂ሺܴ௜ ሻ; f'>0, f''<0

The concavity assumption reflects the diminishing marginal returns from R&D into a given
technology at a given time, which has been demonstrated empirically (e.g., Popp, 2002).
We model uncertainty in the returns to R&D into Technology 2 using a simple
multiplicative shock to the cost reduction function. Specifically, we assume that with probability
p, there is a multiplicative shock T to f(R2), where T >1. With probability (1-p), the cost
reduction in period 2 from R2 is f(R2). This is a stylized approach, for simplicity and clarity, in
which the probability p represents a realized cost reduction; in reality there is a sequence of
conditions that must occur before the cost reduction occurs, including successful innovation,
diffusion, etc., which we do not explicitly treat here. Furthermore, we assume that the magnitude
of the exogenous cost shock T > Tc is sufficiently large that it will make Technology 2 lower cost
and therefore preferred to Technology 1 in the second period. For ease of explication, we
neglect the case where T < Tc ; this case has a trivial result since all R&D should go to
Technology 1.
Because the motivation for this research is emissions reduction to address climate
change, we assume that there is an emissions target in stage 2 that must be met. Because we
have two non-carbon energy technologies that are perfect substitutes, the decision maker will
adopt the technology that has the lowest costs in stage 2. In this case, we can frame the objective

9

function for the R&D decision as one of minimizing the expected cost of whichever technology
is adopted. Specifically, we assume that with probability p, Technology 2 will be adopted with a
cost of ‫ܥ‬ଶଵ െ ߠ݂ሺܴଶ ሻ, and with probability (1-p) Technology 1 is adopted with a cost of ‫ܥ‬ଵଵ െ

݂ሺ‫ ܤ‬െ ܴଶ ሻ. We therefore write the objective function as

ோభ ǡோమ ‫݌‬ሾ‫ܥ‬ଶଵ െ ߠ݂ሺܴଶ ሻሿ ൅ ሺͳ െ ‫݌‬ሻሾ‫ܥ‬ଵଵ െ ݂ሺ‫ ܤ‬െ ܴଶ ሻሿ.

(1)

Taking the derivative and setting to zero, the first-order condition is:
െߠ‫ ݂݌‬ᇱ ሺܴଶ ሻ ൅ ሺͳ െ ‫݌‬ሻ݂ ᇱ ሺ‫ ܤ‬െ ܴଶ ሻ ൌ Ͳ.

Rearranging this, we can express the optimality condition for R&D in Technology 2 as:
݂ ᇱ ሺܴଶ ሻ ൌ ݂Ԣሺ‫ ܤ‬െ ܴଶ ሻ ή

ଵି௣
௣ఏ

.

(2)

The intuition for the expression in equation (2) is as follows. Relative to a solution
where R&D is allocated such that the marginal productivities of R&D are equal (as would be
implied by ݂ ᇱ ሺܴଶ ሻ ൌ ݂Ԣሺ‫ ܤ‬െ ܴଶ ሻ), the effect of the second term on the RHS is that as the

probability p of a better than expected shock increases, or as the magnitude of that shock T
increases, the optimal allocation will consist of R2 at a lower marginal productivity than R1.
From the concavity assumption, this in turn implies that R2 will be increasing in both p and T.
Put more simply, this result indicates that as the probability of a higher than average
shock or the magnitude of a higher than average shock increases, increased R&D investment into
the expensive technology will be optimal. As we will show below in the numerical results, this
is particularly true for positively-skewed distributions. Because a probability distribution must
integrate to unity, a necessary condition for increasing the magnitude of an extreme upper
quantile while holding the expected value constant is that there must be correspondingly more
probability mass below the mean of the distribution. In such a distribution, proportionally more
random draws will yield below average returns. In order to achieve the same expected cost
10

reduction as a distribution with the same mean but less skewed, more random draws are required.
One can think of “more draws” as roughly implying greater R&D investment. In this stylized
example, greater skewness therefore implies that more R&D investment is optimal.
The model presented above is necessarily simplified and omits many critical features.
Such features include the presence of cumulative, depreciating knowledge capital stock, a nonlinear formulation for the innovation possibilities frontier, a dependence of the benefits of R&D
on the exact amount of future adoption of each technology, less than perfect substitutability, and
multiple R&D decision stages. Because simple analytical closed-form solutions are not possible
for a model with these features, we turn for the remainder of the paper to a numerical model.

3. Numerical Model Methodology
For a numerical example, we build on the ENTICE (Popp, 2004) and ENTICE-BR
models (Popp, 2006a, 2006b), both of which are extensions of the DICE model (Nordhaus and
Boyer, 2000). ENTICE and ENTICE-BR are integrated assessment models of climate change
that represent the global economy and environment and include endogenous technological
change. ENTICE included R&D into energy efficiency among the decision variables, and
ENTICE-BR added R&D into a non-carbon emitting energy backstop technology.
We modify the ENTICE-BR model to address the question of what is the optimal R&D
allocation across two substitutable energy backstops under uncertainty. The original ENTICEBR model includes R&D investment to augment two knowledge capital stocks according to an
innovation possibilities frontier, one which increases the energy efficiency of the economy and
one which lowers the cost of a non-carbon energy backstop. The original model is deterministic,

11

and the parameters in the model were calibrated to be consistent with historically observed
patterns of R&D, energy patents, and energy consumption (Popp, 2001; Popp, 2002).
Here, we introduce three major modifications to the original ENTICE-BR model: 1) we
replace the single non-carbon energy backstop with two backstops that can substitute for each
other; 2) we modify the representation of the knowledge stock to distinguish the dual roles for
knowledge capital of generating new knowledge and reducing technology cost; and 3) the model
is reframed as a stochastic dynamic programming problem, and is solved using approximate
dynamic programming. Finally, for the case study of wind vs. solar in the following section, we
calibrate parameters in this model to be consistent with results from Popp et al. (2013), which
used forward patent citation counts by energy technology type to explore the distribution of
uncertain returns to R&D and the decay rate of knowledge capital by technology. Each of the
above modifications is described in detail below.

3.1 Two Backstop Technologies
The DICE/ENTICE family of models all have the objective of maximizing the present
value of discounted utility, subject to economic and climate system constraints. Here we discuss
only the relevant constraints that are modified, and provide the full model description in the
Appendix. In the original ENTICE-BR, output Qt is produced by physical capital stock Kt, labor
Lt, and effective energy units Et. Labor grows according to an exogenous population growth
trend, and physical capital stock is the result of investment plus the previous period’s stock that
has not depreciated. Overall technological progress is modeled with total factor productivity At.
Effective energy units are produced from three possible energy inputs: fossil fuels Ft, a carbonfree backstop Bt, and knowledge pertaining to energy efficiency HE,t. The cost of fossil fuels and

12

backstop energy, respectively are pF,t and pB,t, and are subtracted from total output. Thus the
production function for the economy is:

ఉ

‫ܧ‬௧ െ ‫݌‬ிǡ௧ ‫ܨ‬௧ െ ‫݌‬஻ǡ௧ ‫ܤ‬௧ .

(1)

Effective energy units are produced from a nested constant elasticity of substitution
(CES) representation that aggregate fossil fuels Ft, backstop energy Bt, and knowledge stock for
energy efficiency HE,t:

The elasticity of substitution between fossil fuels and backstop energy is ͳΤሺͳ െ ߩ஻ ሻ, and the

elasticity of substitution between the fossil/backstop bundle and energy efficiency is
ͳΤሺͳ െ ߩு ሻ.

We extend this model to include two carbon-free energy backstops, B1,t and B2,t. Thus

equation (2) is replaced with:

The elasticity of substitution between the two backstops is ͳΤሺͳ െ ߩ఑ ሻ. Similarly, we denote

the respective costs of the backstops with pB1,t and pB2,t and subtract these from total output.
Equation (1) is therefore replaced by:

3.2 Knowledge Stock Representation of Technological Change
In ENTICE-BR, the cost of the backstop can be reduced by investing in a knowledge
stock HB,t. The knowledge stock increases with the accumulation of research and development
RB,t, as:
‫ܪ‬஻ǡ௧ ൌ ݄൫ܴ஻ǡ௧ ൯ ൅ ሺͳ െ ߜு ሻ‫ܪ‬஻ǡ௧ିଵ

(5)

The parameter ߜு represents knowledge decay. The function ݄൫ܴ஻ǡ௧ ൯ is the innovation

possibility frontier, which models the process of new knowledge creation from R&D and the
existing knowledge stock:
௕

థ

݄൫ܴ஻ǡ௧ ൯ ൌ ܴܽ஻ǡ௧ಳ ‫ܪ‬஻ǡ௧ಳ .

(6)

Both bB and IB are assumed to be between 0 and 1, and IB < 1 represents diminishing returns to
research across time (Popp, 2004). Finally, the relationship between accumulating knowledge
stock and the cost of the energy backstop is represented by:
‫݌‬஻ǡ௧ ൌ

௉ಳǡబ
ആ

ுಳǡ೟

.

(7)

The parameter K converts knowledge stock level to the reduction from the backstop cost in the
initial period, and is calibrated so that ͳ െ ʹିఎ is the cost reduction from a doubling of the

knowledge stock. Consistent with other treatments of endogenous technological change, we

assume here that an increase in the knowledge stock necessarily leads to a reduction in the cost
of the technology. In reality, new knowledge can sometimes increase cost, or even increase
uncertainty, although such cases may be fairly nuanced, with accompanying increases in quality.
For purposes of clarity, we do not include the possibility of increased cost from new knowledge
here, but leave that to future work.
One of the challenges in calibrating representations of technological change such as
described above using empirical data is that although there is evidence that knowledge decays
14

over time, using non-zero depreciation rates has the effect that a non-zero level of R&D is
required to simply maintain the backstop cost at a constant level over time. Without new R&D
investments in a model like equations (5-7), the cost of the backstop will rise over time as the
knowledge stock decays. This behavior is not intuitive. Despite the evidence that knowledge’s
effectiveness at creating new knowledge decays, there is not comparable evidence that the
reduction in the cost of a technology from the stock of knowledge decays. Once a cost reducing
change to a technology has been innovated, diffused, and adopted, it remains part of the state of
the art of that technology.
Here we introduce a modification to the prevailing representation of knowledge stock to
address the challenge just described. Instead of a single knowledge stock for each technology,
we separately track two distinct but related knowledge stocks for each technology. One
௄
knowledge stock, ‫ܪ‬஻ǡ௧
, is combined with new R&D investment to create new knowledge (as in

஼
equation (6)). This first type of stock depreciates over time. The second stock, ‫ܪ‬஻ǡ௧
, is used only

for the reduction of technology costs (as in equation (7)). This latter stock does not depreciate

over time, so that if R&D investments are set to zero after a given time, the technology costs will
remain constant. This modeling innovation allows us to calibrate the model to fit historical
observations on both wind and solar technologies for the case study presented in section 4.4.
The dynamics and constraints for both stocks are defined for each of the two backstop
technologies.
The model used here therefore includes the following constraints, which replace
equations (5-7). The knowledge stock dynamics are:

3.3 Stochastic Dynamic Formulation
As described above, the objective function for the deterministic version of the model is to
maximize the present value of discounted utility, subject to the economic and climate system
constraints, or mathematically:

X(t) represents the decision vector over time, which includes investment in physical capital stock
as well as R&D and the energy produced from fossil and the backstop sources. In general, we
assume that utility is a function of per capita consumption c(t) and population L(t), and that U(t)
is the social rate of time preference.
To model decision under uncertainty, we reformulate the model as a stochastic dynamic
program. We use a formulation consistent with that in Webster et al (2012), in which the DICE
model was framed as a seven-stage stochastic dynamic program. Here, we also assume seven1
decision stages for the reference version of the model t = {1,2,…,7}. The decision or action
space of the model consists of the R&D investment into each of the two backstop energy
technologies and the quantity of energy produced from each backstop in the current stage, X =

As shown in Webster et al. (2012) and also in the Appendix to this paper, the impact on the first stage decision of
the number of decision stages is roughly the same for any number of stages T greater than five. The choice of seven
stages is for computational tractability. Given sufficient computing power, the results for T = 35 (decadal decisions)
would be qualitatively the same.

[R1, R2, B1, B2]. Uncertainty is represented in the returns to R&D as modeled by the innovation
possibilities frontier (eq. 9). We introduce a multiplicative shock T to the function ݄൫ܴ஻ǡ௧ ൯, and
assume that T is drawn i.i.d. from a distribution with an expected value of 1, such that the mean
of many draws is equal to the original deterministic model. We consider many different
distributions in the analysis, and describe them in the next section.
The solution of the finite horizon stochastic dynamic program described can be obtained
by solving the Bellman equations (Bellman, 2003) for all states and all stages:

The value function Vt is a mapping from state to optimal value, and the conventional solution
method for a finite-horizon problem is backward induction. However, backward induction
requires that the state space is defined such that the process is Markov. For the ENTICE-BR
model including the modifications described above, this would require a twelve-dimensional
state space (see Appendix). For a seven-stage model and any reasonable discretization resolution
in each dimension of state space, the computational cost of exact DP would be prohibitive.
As a result, we solve the model using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP)
(Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis 1996; Powell 2007). ADP methods find an approximate solution to the
dynamic programming problem using adaptive random sampling to estimate an approximation of
the value function, using basis functions defined on a subset of the dimensions of the state space.
The specific algorithm is similar to that applied in Webster et al. (2012), but with a few key
differences, described here; the full description may be found in the Appendix. In this study, we
approximate the value function as a linear function of the prices of the two backstops:

The vector E is solved for using least squares on an initial set of sample paths, and then is
iteratively updated using the Bellman Error method (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis 1996) until
convergence.

4. Numerical Case Study: R&D Allocation Across Two Backstops
In this section, we explore the factors that determine optimal allocation of R&D across
two substitutable energy backstops in the ENTICE-BR model. We begin with the dynamics
when the returns to R&D are deterministic. We then show how the results change when the
returns to R&D are stochastic, using a reference distribution for the shock to R&D returns. We
then focus on a case where the cost in the initial period of Backstop 2 is 50% greater than that of
Backstop 1, and show the sensitivity of optimal R&D for Backstop 2 to variance and skewness
of the distribution. Finally, we use parameters and distributions calibrated to Popp et al (2013)
as described above to simulate a case study of Wind vs Solar R&D.

4.1 Deterministic Results
In the absence of uncertainty, the major determinant of the optimal R&D shares is the
ratio of the backstop prices. The benefit of R&D in each period is the reduction in expected
future costs. Therefore, backstop energy use in future periods largely determines the R&D into
that technology in each period. To illustrate this effect, we present the optimal backstop use and
R&D for both technologies for three different initial prices of Backstop 2, $600, $1200, and
$1800 per ton of carbon equivalent (CTE) (Fig. 1). Based on Popp (2006a), conventional fossil
energy is $276 CTE, so the assumed initial backstop prices in the results below are slightly more
than double, four times, and six times the cost of fossil energy. In all cases, the initial price of

initial prices for Backstop 2 of $600, $1200, and $1800 (Backstop 1 is $1200 in the initial period for all
cases).

Backstop 1 is $1200. The elasticity of substitution between the two backstops is assumed to be
5.0, which is highly elastic and makes the two backstops behave as nearly perfect substitutes.
As expected for substitutable technologies, when the initial prices are equal (both at
$1200), the backstop use and the R&D are equally divided between the two technologies. When
the initial price of Backstop 2 is $600, substantially more of this technology is used to provide
non-carbon energy, and less of Backstop 1 is used. The R&D into Backstop 1 is also lower in
this case. When the initial price of Backstop 2 is $1800, more energy is produced from Backstop
1 and less from Backstop 2, and a similar pattern in R&D investment allocation is observed.
Note that the low and high initial price cases are not symmetric, because the average cost over
both backstops are not equivalent across cases. The total energy produced from both backstops
is greatest for initial prices of $1200 (B1) and $600 (B2), and the total energy is the lowest for

initial prices of $1200 (B1) and $1800 (B2) (Table 1). Total R&D, however, follows a different
pattern, with total R&D across both technologies being greatest for the case with initial prices of
$1200 (B1) and $1200 (B2), and least total R&D is for the case where initial prices are $1200
(B1) and $600 (B2). When prices are lower for both backstops from the beginning, the marginal
benefit of R&D (i.e., the avoided future cost of backstop energy) is lower, which leads to less
R&D investment. Note that in this model we only consider cost reductions from R&D and omit
any learning-by-doing effects that would yield additional cost reductions in the technologies as a
function of cumulative production.

4.2 Stochastic Results for a Reference Distribution
To further investigate the dynamics of R&D allocation across the two backstops, we next
introduce uncertainty in the returns to R&D for Backstop 2 (Backstop 1 R&D remains
deterministic in this subsection). As described in Section 3, the quantity of new knowledge
created from R&D into Backstop 2 (eq. 9) is multiplied by a random shock T that is drawn from
a Normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 0.3. In the next subsection,

20

we will perform sensitivity analysis on the distribution of the shock. As above, we assume here
that the initial price for Backstop 1 is $1200, and that the elasticity of substitution between the
backstops is 5.0 (highly elastic).
For all stochastic results shown here and in the rest of the paper, the solution method is as
follows. First, the ADP algorithm is used to solve for the approximate value functions. After the
value functions have converged, an additional set of random sample paths are simulated, with
optimal decisions chosen on the basis of the value functions. For this set of sample paths, there
is an optimal first stage decision and a probability distribution for latter stage decisions and other
endogenous results. We will present most results in terms of the median and 90% probability
range for all backstop energy and R&D investment decisions in Stages 2 through 7.
Consider first an initial cost of Backstop 2 of $600, much lower cost than Backstop 1
with a cost of $1200. For all sampled paths of new knowledge creation for Backstop 2, the
energy used from the backstops is the same, consisting of slightly over 3 times as much from
Backstop 2 as from Backstop 1 (Fig. 2a,b). In contrast, the paths of optimal R&D into backstop
2 do vary with each sample path, with a 90% probability range across the samples of +/- 25%.
When better than average shocks to knowledge creation are observed, more R&D into Backstop
2 is optimal. The marginal benefit of additional R&D into Backstop 2 is a function of the
expected avoided costs of using that backstop in all future periods. Because the backstop energy
decisions are not changing for these parameter values, the observed variation in R&D is entirely
due to changes in the productivity of R&D that results in larger or smaller cost reductions for
future energy use; there is no substitution induced between the two backstops.

Similarly, if the initial cost of Backstop 2 is $1800, much higher than the cost of
Backstop 1, the backstop energy decisions do not change across the sampled shocks to
knowledge creation, but the optimal R&D into Backstop 2 does vary (Fig. 2e,f). In this case,
roughly 8 times as much energy is produced from Backstop 1 as from Backstop 2. The relative
variability in optimal R&D is similar to the $600 case, growing to +/- 20%. However, the
magnitude is much lower because less energy is produced from Backstop 2, and therefore the
benefits of lowering its cost are reduced.
A different dynamic is observed for the case of equal initial costs of backstops (Fig.
2c,d). In this case, the energy produced from both backstops does vary with the particular
sample path of shocks to knowledge creation. The median path of energy decisions is the same
as the deterministic optimal path from the previous section, consisting of equal shares of energy
produced from the backstops. However, better than average returns from R&D into Backstop 2
in early periods leads to greater energy production and greater R&D being optimal for Backstop
2, and correspondingly less from Backstop 1. The converse is also true for worse than average
returns to R&D into backstop 2 in early periods. When technology costs are similar, the
variation in optimal R&D reflects the aggregation of two effects: the benefit of lowering the cost
of energy that would be used anyway (as in the $600 and $1800 cases), and additionally the
benefit of lowering the cost of the technology sufficiently that it substitutes for the other highercost technology, which further reduces future total energy costs.

4.3 Sensitivity to Distribution Shape
We next vary the probability distribution from which the shock to knowledge creation is
drawn. The purpose of this sensitivity analysis is to investigate the influence of characteristics of

23

the probability distribution on the optimal R&D portfolio across the two backstops. We consider
a range of parameters for three different distribution families, the Normal or Gaussian
distribution, the Lognormal distribution, and the Generalized Pareto distribution. The latter two
are positively-skewed distributions, and the magnitude of the skewness varies with the
parameters2; see Fig. 3 for an example probability density function from each of these families
for one choice of distribution parameters. In all cases, the distribution for the multiplicative
shock is normalized to ensure that the expected value is equal to 1.0, so that the mean of a large
number of samples of new knowledge created by R&D will approximately equal the
deterministic value. For the Lognormal distribution, we use parameters P=3.0 and vary V over
the range 0.5 to 1.5. For the Generalized Pareto distribution, we set the location parameter P and
the scale parameter V both to 0.5, and vary the shape parameter [ from 0.4 to 1.0.
We compare the optimal ratio of R&D across the two backstops for a range of initial
costs of Backstop 2 (Backstop 1 remains $1200 in the first period in all cases), and for several
alternative assumptions about the uncertainty in returns to R&D (Fig. 4). The overall trend is
dominated by the relative costs of the two technologies, independent of the representation of
uncertainty. For the deterministic case (solid line in Fig. 4), the R&D into backstop 2 exceeds
the R&D in Backstop 1 when the initial cost of Backstop 2 is below $1200. Note that the impact
of initial cost on R&D allocation is non-monotonic below $1200. This behavior is a
consequence of the interaction of the two effects demonstrated above. If the cost of Backstop 2
is moderately lower than the cost of Backstop 1 (e.g., $800), then the benefits of R&D into
Backstop 2 are the sum of 1) the benefits of reducing the cost of Backstop 2 energy that would

2

Empirical research on the returns to R&D consistently finds evidence of highly skewed results -- some research
projects result in grand successes worth billions of dollars, while others end in failure, with millions spent without
any positive results. See, for example, Pakes (1986), Shankerman and Pakes (1986), Schanerkam (1998), and Jaffe
and Trajtenberg (2002).

have been used in the absence of further R&D, and 2) the benefit of reducing the cost of
Backstop 2 sufficiently to substitute away from the higher-cost Backstop 1 and further reduce
total energy costs. For very low initial costs (e.g., $600), no substitution will occur and the cost
before R&D is already low, so the marginal benefits of further cost reductions are smaller.
When the initial costs of Backstop 2 are greater than $1200, the optimal R&D for Backstop 2 is
less than the R&D for Backstop 1, and is decreasing in the initial backstop cost.

Backstop 2. The solid line indicates the optimal ratio with no uncertainty, the long dashed line indicates
the ratio when the uncertainty in returns to R&D follows a Normal distribution (V=0.3), the short dashed
line is for the Lognormal distribution (V=0.7), and the dotted lines is for a Generalized Pareto distribution
with shape parameter [ = 0.4.

Relative to the optimal R&D ratio in the deterministic case, the effect of uncertainty in
the returns to R&D on Stage 1 is to increase the relative R&D investment in Backstop 2, relative
to Backstop 1, for any level of initial backstop cost. We illustrate the effect of uncertainty on the
optimal Stage 1 R&D ratio with three example distributions: Normal (V=0.3), Lognormal
(V=0.7), and Generalized Pareto ([=0.4). Note that the relative order of optimal R&D ratio by
distribution is not consistent over all initial costs of Backstop 2.
26

To further investigate the impact of the distribution shape on the optimal R&D portfolio,
we focus on a relevant, if stylized, case of initial Backstop 2 cost at $1800, 50% greater than the
initial cost of Backstop 1. In a dynamic programming setting, the optimal decision is the one
that maximizes the sum of the expected utility of the current stage and the expected value of
being in a particular state at the next stage. For the R&D decision, the opportunity cost of the
R&D causes the utility of the current stage to be decreasing in R&D. The expected value of the
next stage depends on the expected costs of the backstops, and therefore is generally increasing
in R&D investment. The sum of the two components is a convex function, as shown in Figure 5.
Here, we plot the expected value of utility observed in stage 1 for different levels of R&D
investment in backstop #2. The optimal R&D for any distribution occurs where this function is
maximized, as shown by the vertical lines in Figure 5. The effect of an increase in uncertainty in
returns to R&D is to increase the expected marginal utility of a unit of R&D in the current stage.
The reason for this effect is the asymmetry in the impact of cost reductions. A smaller than
average return to R&D produces little cost reduction, but the cost is not more than the current
cost. A larger than average return to R&D produces a very large cost reduction and therefore
significantly increases utility. The average over many smaller and larger than expected returns
to R&D is a higher expected benefit of R&D, while the opportunity cost of R&D is unchanged.
The net effect of increasing uncertainty in returns to R&D is to increase the optimal R&D
investment into Backstop 2. A positively-skewed distribution (Lognormal or Pareto) results in
an even higher optimal level of R&D (note that in Figure 5, the maximum of the curves are
increasing as a more skewed distribution is assumed), suggesting that skewness may be a
relevant factor in addition to variance. Another way to view the same result is to examine the
values of the coefficients for the approximate value function for Stage 2 after convergence. The

27

approximate value function is a linear function of the costs of the two backstops. Note that the
primary effect of varying the distribution of uncertain returns to R&D is to increase the
magnitude of the coefficient for the cost of Backstop 2 (Table II). In other words, for higher
variance and higher skewness, there is greater expected utility for a one dollar reduction in the
cost of Backstop 2.
To further illuminate the influence of alternative distributions, we also show the median
and 90% ranges for the optimal energy and R&D decisions over all Stages when the initial cost
of Backstop 2 is $1800 and the distribution of uncertain returns is either Lognormal or Pareto
(Fig. 6). The relevant comparisons for these figures are with Figs. 2e and 2f, which show the

an initial cost of $1800, the energy produced from Backstop 2 did not vary across the sample
paths. In contrast, energy from Backstop 2 may increase under the Lognormal distribution, and
the potential (upper 90%) energy production from Backstop 2 under the Pareto increases even
further. Substitution of Backstop 2 for Backstop 1 may occur under these distributions, because
of the long upper tail and the low probability of very large shocks to knowledge creation. As a
consequence of this potential substitution, as well as the potential cost reduction, the
corresponding variation in optimal R&D is also much larger than for the Normal distribution.
To characterize more generally the effect of the distribution shape on optimal R&D, we
consider a larger set of alternative distributions for the returns to R&D on Backstop 2.
Specifically, we solve for 17 distinct distributions, varying the parameters for Normal,
Lognormal, and Generalized Pareto (indicated as black dots in Fig. 7). As above, we only
consider an initial cost of $1800 for Backstop 2. In general, two effects are apparent across these
solutions. First, as the variance of the distribution increases, the increase in optimal R&D into
Backstop 2 relative to the deterministic solution increases. In addition, an increase in the
skewness of the distribution also increases the optimal R&D into Backstop 2. Plotting these
effects against traditional moments of the distributions, variance and skewness (not shown),
exhibits highly non-linear behavior. However, a transformation of variables, using the natural
log of variance and the difference between 1.0 and the median of the distribution as a measure of
skewness, display a fairly linear relationship between these variables and the relative increase in
optimal stage 1 R&D (surface in Fig. 7). Note that by design, we have restricted all admissible
distributions for this problem to ones with an expected value of 1.0. By definition, therefore, any
positively-skewed distribution will necessarily have a median that is less than 1.0.

Figure 7: Optimal Stage 1 R&D into Backstop 2 relative to Deterministic Optimal R&D as a function of
the log of the variance and the distance between 1.0 and the median of the distribution (as a measure of
skewness). Dots indicate results for a specific distribution (i.e., given family and given parameter values),
and the surface plot is the linear regression over all distributions simulated.

Recall that in Section 2, we derived an expression for the optimality conditions for the
simple stylized model which showed that optimal R&D into the expensive backstop with
uncertain returns was increasing in p, the probability of a higher than average shock, and
increasing in T, the magnitude of the higher than average return to R&D (eq. 2). An increase in
p or in T in this simple model is equivalent to increasing both the variance and the skewness of

31

the distribution. Thus, the general behavior of the numerical model is consistent with that of the
simple analytical model.

4.4 Case Study: Wind vs. Solar
Here, we use the numerical model to examine R&D for a pair of technologies that are
part of the public debate over low-carbon energy, wind and solar. These technologies are often
compared because they are both non-carbon electricity sources that are intermittent. Typical
estimates are that solar photovoltaic has 60% greater cost than on-shore wind. As discussed in
the Introduction, some have argued based on recent “failures” in solar that further investment is
not justified. We calibrate relevant parameters of our two-backstop model to approximate
critical characteristics of wind and solar technologies. We then use the numerical model to
explore optimal investment strategies in latter stages after observing below average R&D
outcomes in previous stages.
For parameter calibration, we use results from Popp et al (2013), which characterized
differences in patent forward citations by energy technology. By showing the links between past
and current innovation, patent citations are an indicator of the social value of innovation as a
௄
building block for future research, and thus analogous to the variable ‫ܪ‬஻ǡ௧
in our model

(Lanjouw & Schankerman 2004, Popp, 2002). One of the features shown to vary widely by

technology was the effect of citation lag on the probability of citation. One can consider this as
proxy for the decay rate of the knowledge stock used to create new knowledge for a given
technology. The faster the probability of citation decreases with time, the faster the depreciation
rate for the knowledge stock. We therefore calibrate our depreciation parameters for wind and
solar to these results (see Fig. 5 in Popp et al., 2013). This procedure yields a depreciation rate

32

of 0.01 for wind and of 0.05 for solar, leading to faster knowledge decay in the latter. These
estimates reflect the fact that wind and solar technologies are in very different stages of the
innovation process, and wind is much less sensitive to knowledge stock decay as explained in
more detail in Popp et al. (2013).
In terms of initial prices of the backstops, we keep wind (Backstop 1) at $1200, and solar
PV (Backstop 2) is assumed to be $2000. This is based on the ratio of the current levelized costs
of electricity estimated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA, 2015), which estimates
that the levelized cost of solar PV is 67% greater than the cost of (on-shore) wind.
Modifying the depreciation rates alone leads to results that are inconsistent with the
calibration of the rest of the model. We therefore repeat the calibration exercises of Popp
(2006a), and adjust the scale parameter a in the IPF (see eq. 6) to ensure that the backstop cost
trend over time is consistent with the costs produced by the original reference parameter values.
We use the original single-backstop version of ENTICE-BR for the calibration exercise, and
adjust parameter values for only wind and for only solar, respectively, applying each of the
above depreciation rates. This procedure leads to values for a of 0.017 for wind and 0.0314 for
solar. In other words, to preserve the price trend observed over time with faster depreciation
requires correspondingly greater average effectiveness of R&D at creating new knowledge.
Finally, we calibrate the shape of the distribution of uncertain returns to R&D to match
the shape of the distribution of patent forward citations for wind and for solar (see Fig. 2 in Popp
et al., 2013). Using 1995 as a representative year, and normalizing so that the expected value of
both distributions are 1, we find that for wind a Normal distribution with variance 0.5 and for
solar an Exponential distribution with parameter O = 1 best fit the shape of forward citations for
the respective technologies.

33

To illustrate the results, we focus here on the ratio of energy production and the ratio of
R&D investment between the two backstops (Solar / Wind), rather than the absolute magnitudes
of R&D and energy decisions. Presenting the outcome in this form relates more directly to the
objective of informing relative R&D allocation. We therefore explicitly report the ratio of
backstop energy and R&D for each sample path after convergence, and summarize with the
median and 90% range of that ratio over time.
The results are shown in Figure 8. If there were no uncertainty in returns to R&D for
either technology, the energy production from Solar would be 12% of that from Wind for all
stages. Under uncertainty in R&D, the median energy production is the same as the
deterministic solution. But the 90% range runs from zero on the low end (after Stage 3) to as
high as 70% that of Wind. The difference between the deterministic and stochastic results for

34

the R&D ratio is more striking (Fig. 7b). The optimal R&D for Solar in the absence of
uncertainty is roughly 20% of that for Wind. Under uncertainty, the optimal first stage R&D
ratio is significantly higher, nearly 50%. The median R&D ratio remains well above the
deterministic solution for all except the last stage. The 90% range for the R&D ratio is quite
broad, from zero to 60%.
Finally, we use the results of simulations of size N=1000 sample paths (after
convergence) of random R&D shocks to examine the question of how to respond to a below
average result from R&D into Solar. Because the random returns to R&D and the decisions are
all continuous, we use illustrative definitions for a “poor outcome” from R&D and for “eventual
success” of a technology. Different threshold values could be used, but the qualitative results
remain the same. Here, we assume that a random draw for the multiplicative shock to the returns
to R&D into Solar of less than 0.5 (where 1.0 defines the mean outcome) defines a “poor
outcome”. We also define “eventual success” of Solar as a sample path for which the backstop
energy produced from Solar in Stage 7 is greater than 1 (the median outcome over all 1000
samples is 0.98). This set of sample paths will consist of the samples for which there is more
substitution of Solar for Wind than occurs in the deterministic solution.
Using these thresholds to operationalize the concepts, within a sample set of 1000, there
were 387 for which the random shock to R&D for Solar was less than 0.5 in the first stage, or a
probability of 0.387. We wish to consider the optimal R&D into Solar in Stage 2, conditional on
observing this “poor outcome” from Stage 1, and also the conditional probability of eventual
success given this outcome from the first stage. The model gives a conditional optimal R&D
decision for Solar in Stage 2 of $634M, not significantly less than the unconditional optimal
decision of $710M. One poor draw is not sufficient to justify major reductions in R&D into

35

Solar. Conditional on a poor outcome in Stage 1 as defined here, the probability of eventual
success of Solar is 0.018. This is considerably less than the unconditional probability of success
across all 1000 samples, 0.071, but may still be large enough to justify continued R&D for
another stage.
Of course, repeated poor outcomes over many stages should not lead to continued R&D
investment at the same level. In this model, if the outcomes of the first three stages are poor
outcomes (less than half the expected value), then the optimal R&D investment into Solar from
Stage 4 onwards is effectively zero.

5. Concluding Discussion
This paper has addressed the question of optimal R&D portfolios into low carbon energy
technologies in the context of climate change. We developed both simple analytical and detailed
numerical models to represent two substitutable low-carbon energy technologies, each of which
can have costs reduced through R&D. Using both approaches, we have demonstrated that given
two technologies with different initial costs and uncertainty in the outcomes of R&D into the
higher cost technology, the optimal R&D investment into the higher cost technology is
increasing in both the variance and the positive skewness of the R&D uncertainty.
In contrast with other approaches that model specific technologies in more detail to
examine the optimal portfolio question, we have deliberately focused on a stylized model of two
technologies and performed sensitivity analyses to explore the general conditions that justify
R&D investment into a higher cost substitute. Nevertheless, we do present one analysis in
which parameters are calibrated to be consistent with observations of wind and solar patent
citations. Using that example, we illustrate that significant R&D investment into solar is

36

justified – the optimal portfolio would divide the R&D budget into roughly 2/3 to wind and 1/3
to solar in the first stage. We also illustrate in that example that a poor outcome from R&D into
solar in the first stage does not lead to a large reduction in the optimal solar R&D in stage 2.
Repeated poor outcomes over three or more stages must be observed before abandoning solar is,
however, justified.
It is important to stress the related questions that we explicitly do not address, because the
model used here is not appropriate for them. One key question is the socially optimal division of
R&D between the public and private sectors. This question requires more detailed modeling of
spillovers and knowledge externalities than captured in ENTICE. Nor do we address how R&D
into energy technologies should be, or will be, divided among different nations. Clearly, energy
technologies exist in a global market, and technological advances achieved in one country reduce
the costs of that technology to consumers in other countries. However, this issue involves
complex issues of economic competitiveness. The results have focused only on the socially
optimal total global R&D, without consideration of public/private or international divisions of
effort. Finally, we have examined here the case of two easily substitutable energy technologies.
Some technologies are complementary in order to make the energy system function reliably, and
the implications for R&D portfolios over a more general set of technologies is left for future
work.
Our main contribution to the debate over energy technology R&D is conceptual. Given
two substitutable technologies, where one is a higher cost today, greater uncertainty in future
R&D outcomes justifies more R&D into that technology. In particular, if one believes that the
distribution of R&D outcomes is highly positively skewed, then considerable R&D may be
justified. A direct consequence of a positively skewed distribution is that the vast majority of

37

outcomes from individual R&D projects will be well below average. Thus a poor outcome from
R&D may not necessarily be reason to abandon future efforts; rather many failures may be
expected along the road to long-shot technology breakthroughs. This perspective lends support
to several recent efforts in the U.S. Department of Energy, including ARPA-E and the Sunshot
Program. An efficient R&D portfolio will therefore allocate R&D both to currently competitive
technologies and also to longshots, in proportion to the expected benefits if successful after all.

Approximate Dynamic Programming Implementation
Here, we briefly present the solution algorithm for the Approximate Dynamic
Programming (ADP) version of ENTICE-BR. More details can be found in
Webster et al. (2012).
Our approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm for solving this
problem is shown in Algorithm 1. ADP is a family of methods (e.g., Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996; Powell, 2007) that approximates the value function
in each stage by adaptively sampling the state space to focus on higher expected
value states until the value function converges. One critical advantage of forward sampling is that this enables a straightforward representation of decisiondependency. Two critical design choices in any efficient ADP algorithm are 1)
the sampling strategy, and 2) the value function approximation.
Our solution algorithm consists of two phases. In phase I, the bootstrap
phase, we use Latin Hypercube Sampling to explore both the action space over
all stages and the R&D result shock space. These sample paths are simulated
forward, and the resulting Bellman values for the sample states and actions are
saved for each decision stage. The full set of these samples of the value function
are used to produce the first estimate of the value function approximation for
each decision stage, using either of the two methods described below.
In phase II, we randomly sample the cost shock in each period to obtain
a sample path, and choose the optimal action in each stage using the current
value function approximations for the value of the next state, and the simulated
ENTICE-BR equations to obtain the current reward. The overall sampling
approach is an efficient (stratified) pure explore strategy in Phase I and a pure
exploit strategy in Phase II.
We employ a parametric approach, using an iterative least squares regression
method, and approximating the value function as a linear function of the prices

where yi is the sampled next system state.
Update ri using a Bellman Error routine:
ri+1 = ri − γi i ∇ri
where γi is a predefined smoothing parameter and

of the two backstops (pB1,t , pB2,t ). The approximation of the value function is
vbt (s) = Φ(s)r

approach.

Sensitivity of Results to Number of Decision Stages
One key assumption in the dynamic programming formulation is the number of
decision stages. The deterministic version of ENTICE-BR solves for 35 decadal
time-steps. Even with the computational efficiency of the ADP implementation,
convergence of a 35-stage model would be prohibitive to solve for for the large
number of scenarios explored in the paper. We therefore reduce the DP formulation to a smaller number of decision stages, each of which consists of several
decades. This raises the question of how the results vary for differing numbers
of stages.
Here we briefly present a sample of results for several different numbers
of stages. Figure 1 shows the ratio of optimal stage 1 R&D for three initial
(t = 0) backstop prices of $1300, $1500, and $1800. Each line shows the ratios
as a function of initial backstop price for different numbers of decisions stages
(N = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11). There are two main features to note. First, relatively more
R&D investment into the risky technology (Backstop 2) is optimal for shorter
decision periods (i.e., larger numbers of decision stages). This is because with
more future stages to reinvest in case of an early success, the expected marginal
benefit of investment increases. However, it is also true that the qualitative
results of the paper, such as the sensitivity to the initial backstop price, is
robust to the number of stages. Notice that the curves all follow the same trend,
and are are simply vertically shifted from one another. Given the robustness
of this and other key results, we have chosen N = 7 stages as a compromise
between representing the multi-stage characteristics of this problem, and the
computational burden of achieving convergence for every case explored in the
paper.
