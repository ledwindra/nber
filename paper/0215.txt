MITIGATING DEMOGRAPHIC RISK THROUGH
SOCIAL INSURANCE
-

Jerry R. Green

Abstract

-

A two-period lifetime overlapping generations growth model is

used to evaluate the possibility that social insurance can effectively
offset economic risks associated with uncertainty about the rate of

population growth. Crude measures of the seriousness of this type of
risk in the current United States situation are presented. Sufficient
conditions on the structure of the economy for such intergenerational

risk pooling to be mutually beneficial to all members of society are

derived. Although it is logically possible to satisfy them1 we argue
that they are unlikely to be realized empirically in an economy similar

to that of the United States. Because of this failure, some more complex types of policy options are also discussed.

2

1. Introduction
Because the return to savings depends on future values of the

capital-labor ratio, fluctuations in the rate of population growth induce

variations in future consumption financed in this way. At the same time,

wages are similarly uncertain but negatively related to interest rates.
This simple fact raises the possibility that mutually advantageous social
insurance schemes might be found1 in which an intergenerational transfer is made contingent upon the realized rate of population growth.

Among the arguments for social insurance has always been that
the government might have risk-pooling opportunities superior to those

of the private market. The government's advantage might take the form
of intertemporal averaging of random returns, smoothing out fluctuations

that would otherwise require a perfect ability to borrow and lend. Others
posit that the government might be able to pool risks at a single moment in

time in ways unavailable to private investors. These claims have been
seriously challenged on factual grounds, but, whether or not they are
correct, they do not apply to the risks of demographic change.

By its very nature, the size of one's generation is a random

variable common to all its members. There are no independent risks
among which to diversify. Even intertemporally1 although fertility rates
display a wide range of variation, they are highly autocorrelated. Long
cycles in the age profile of the population result, sometimes on the

order of decades. These types of risks are not effectively dampened by
the ability to borrow and lend over the life-cycle.

Therefore the prospects for mitigating demographic risks rest with
the government because the necessary social insurance policies would

3

bridge generations not contemporaneous when the contract would have to

be initiated. In this paper, the possibility of using social insurance for
such a purpose is investigated. The results are not entirely positive.
Even though risks to adjacent generations are negatively correlated, it
may not be possible to improve the welfare of both in this way. For
some economic situations, however, mutually beneficial schemes do

exist.
The discussion is organized as follows: Section 2 presents some
specifics of the problem of demographic risks relevant to the current

situation in the United States. Section 3 discusses the criteria which can

be used to evaluate alternative social insurance ichemes. Thecase for
using a Pareto improvement of per capita ex ante expected utilities is

presented. This is the objective adopted throughout the later sections.
Section 4 derives conditions under which a ' small" change away from a
laissez-faire stochastic growth equilibrium will be mutually beneficial

for thembers of two succeeding generations. The results are largely
negative. It is shown that with logarithmic preferences and CobbDouglas production functions there will never exist such a mutually bene-

ficial policy, for any initial oapital stock or stochastip structure of

population growth rates. Either a higher degree of risk aversion, or a
lower elasticity of substitution must prevail if social insurance can be

useful in this regard. Both of these possibilities are then explored.
With logarithmic utility, our general conditions require an elasticity of

substitution under .4, throughout the range of capital-labor ratios that

could arise as a result of different realizations of the growth rate. This
seems too low to offer any realistic hope in this direction. Higher
levels of risk aversion, within the class of those displaying constant
relative risk aversion, have the unfortunate property of implying a

4

negative response of savings to the rate of interest. In the light of
recent empirical findings that indicate a positive elasticity, such an
assumption seems ill advised.
These conclusions demonstrate that although contingent inter-

generational transfer schemes seem as if they could effectively mitigate
risks of demographic change, and although this is a logical possibility,
it requires conditions which are unlikely to be met empirically.
Two further avenues for research and, hopefully, amelioration of

these results, are then presented.

2. The Seriousness of the Problem:
Some Rough Calculations

To get a feeling for the kind of risk involved, we will first look at

some simple estimates of potential variations in the demographic characteristics of the population. Between 1948 and 1975 the fertility rate
(children per woman of child-bearing age) fluctuated between 3. 77 arid

1. 75. A fertility rate of 2. 1 represents a level consistent with zero
population growth. The higher end of this variation was caused by a
variety of factors, most noticeably World War II and a second-generation

effect of the early 20th century immigration waves• For these reasons,
demographers believe that we will not approach such a level again. A

fairly conservative upper-bound estimate is 2. 7. As for the lower end,
the explanations are largely sociological, combined with an increasing

use of contraception and abortion. Although these are imprecisely

understood at present, it is perhaps not unreasonable to take 1. 7 as a
lower bound.

The table above gives some statistics relevant to our crude corn-

putations of variations in the return to saving. Assuming that the rate
of saving is unresponsive to demographic changes occurring in the preretirement years1 we get a first approximation to the impact of different

fertility rates on the capital-labor ratio.
If the amount of capital is K, the three assumptions of the table
produce capital—labor ratios of K/176 751, K/212,852 and 1<1152,378

in the year 2025 for fertility rates of 2.11 2.7 and 1.71 respectively.
Using a Cobb-Douglas production function1 with capital's share set at

• 25, the ratio of the marginal products of capital between the high and
low estimates of fertility would be about 3:4.

This seemingly modest variation in the rental price of capital would

produce very large swings in the total return to saving, accumulated over
an average holding period of say .20 years. For example, assuming constant

proportional taxes on the return to capital in either instance, we might have

a variation in the real net rate of return to saving of between 3% under the
high growth rate and 4% under the low growth rate. At the end of the 20
years, the accumulated wealth can vary by about 9% above or below its

mean level, and the return to saving over a 15—year retirement hbrizon
can vary by about 16% above or below its mean.2

The induced fluctuations in the wage rate of future generations are

smaller, in relative terms, but represent a comparable real magnitude

since wages form a larger share of national income. Wages net of tax
vary by about 7% above and below the middle of their range.

These calculations are obviously inaccurate for several reasons.
To a great extent, fluctuations in the effective working population are

predictable long in advance simply because births lead labor market

entry by about 20 years. On the other hand, the current age structure

8

of the population, including children, is taken into account in the above

table. Our rough computations therefore have already incorporated this
"foreknowledg&' about the future size of the working population.
The rough calculation given above took savings to be independent of

population. Knowledge about future births when they occur will, however,
make the course of the working population somewhat predictable by a

wage earner while he still has time to adjust his savings decisions before

retirement. To the extent that these risks can be partially offset by the
flexibility of private savings, our estimate of the induced variability of

the return to. capital may overstate the real risk of utility loss that may
be suffered.
The twO-period model developed in this paper is subject to the

same qualifications. Because the working period of life is longer than
the retirement period, a two-period model of an individual's lifetime
does not do justice to the richness of the individual's dynamic decision

process as new information accrues during his lifetime. A simulation
experiment trying to capture some of these complexities is currently
under way.

Further features not captured here relate to tije heterogeneity of
the labor force and the endogeneity of labor upp1y. Needless to say,
the structure of wages as a function of age is not constant, nor can It
be properly viewed as an exogenous function of some base wage level,
especially when large swings in the age composition of the labor force

are the central focus of the analysis. There are surely a variety of
institutional factors at work here, some of which are themselves
endogenous. We simply do not have a suitable theory to analyze this,
and it is beyond the scope of this study to construct one.

9

These qualifications aside, however, it may still be useful to pursue
the rough calculations above to estimate the present value of a potential

reduction of uncertainty in future wages and interest rates. Since the
results of any such calculation are going to be sensitive to our choice of
a discount rate and guesses about levels of real income in the future,

among other parameters, we will give an illustrative case, and then
summarize the results under other assumptions in Table 2
To give a lower bound type of estimate, we will proceed in two steps.

We will estimate the present value of the stream of willingnesses to pay

for a reduction in uncertainty about future returns to saving for generations retiring from 2025 to the indefinite future •

and

similarly for

workers from that date onward. Therefore we will be neglecting uncertainty in the intervening 48 years, which could be substantial as seen in
Table 1 above.

By 2025, real retirement income from savings might be on the

order of $11,000 per iamily, or more. Our estimates above suggest a
variation of from $9, 500 to $12,500 due to demographic factors. It is
not hard to imagine that a typical family would be willing to reduce its

income by $100 per year to cut the variance of this return in half. Thus,
for a typical retired family, the value of the reduction in uncertainty
discounted to its date of retirement (at 3.5%, an average real net rate of
return figure) over a 15-year average retirement period would be $1152.

The number of retired families in a given one-year age interval is
a random variable in the long run, but is rather easy to predict for 2025.
With about 30 million retired Individuals, who will form about 18 million

households in 2025, there would be close to 1.5 million households of

age 65 in that year. Averaged over the indefinite horizon, we can safely

3

10

use a figure of about 2 million newly retiring households each year.

Thus, this reduction in uncertainty is worth about $2.3 billion to each

year's retiring cohort on their 65th birthday. To compute the total
social value of this stream at present, we must decide on a social rate
of discount. Using the same rate that was used for the individual's own

computations (a relatively high rate of return, historically, but surely
much lower than the gross return to private capital), we find that this
stream of $2. 3 billion per year, each year from 2025 onward, is worth

today $12.6 billion. Expressed as an annual flow of benefits, at the
same discount rate this is $442 million per year.
On the wage side, future real wages might be fluctuating.in the
range of $18,000 - $21,000, and a reduction in this uncertainty might

easily be worth $100 per family, as in the case of retirees. These
working families have wage earning horizons of about 45 years each;

accumulating over their working lives, one has $2250 per family. The
number of working families becomes more highly variable earlier than

the number of retirees. Let us take a conservative average figure of
100 million working families aged 18-65, or roughly 24 million new

working families entering the 18-year old pool each year. The benefit
per cohort is thus around $5.6 billion, which means a total present value
of $30.8 billion, or an annual flow value of $1.08 billion, at the 3.5%

discount rate.
Combining the benefits of wage earners and retirees, we arrive
at a flow value of about $1.5 billion per year, for a modest reduction in
the risks of population fluctuations.

Apart from its coarseness, and the other qualifying comments
related to a two-period framework already discussed in this section1 a
few comments should be added. The method by which we computed the

potential welfare gain is not a steady-state type of calculation. It is a
gain which would accrue now1 in the current economic situation of the

United States, because of the benefits of a social policy whose impact

would not be strongly felt until well into the next century. But even
though we have discounted these gains to the present at a generous rate1

they still are very significant. A steady—state analysis would surely
show a much higher level of gain, because it would not have to be discounted over so many years.

The potential gain from mitigating risk is somewhat more hidden

than efficiency gains often studied in public finance. Physically, nothing
apparently happens to increase overall productivity or the efficiency of

consumption as in the case of a misallocation of resources. Neverthe-

less, the costs are real and their intangible nature should not disguise
the magnitude of the benefits at stake.

Unfortunately, the conclusions of this paper are largely pessi-

mistic. Although large gains appear possible, we will see that it is
not likely that they can be reaped while simultaneously improving the

welfare of all generations. The nature of such a welfare improvement
is discussed in the next section.

3. Intergenerational Ex Ante Risk Pooling
As discussed above, population growth fluctuations are risky both

for older generations whose return to savings will be affected, and

younger generations whose wages will be affected. The pre-natality of

the latter is at once the source of the uncertainty and the barrier to a
private market solution. A social contract is thus required which specifies a pattern of intergenerational transfer payments in advance of the
realization of the demographic random variables.
How

-

shall we measure the value of such a contract? One way

would be to use a utilitarian criterion; the utility of each agent would
be added in each event, and an expectation of this sum over all events

would be taken. Assuming that all members of a cohort are identical,
we would still have to know the joint distribution of an individual's

utility and the size of his generation. Therefore the efficacy of any
given policy would not be invariant to additive shifts in the utility index.

That is, just as in models with an endogenous population size, some
special meaning would have to attach to a utility of Tizeroll or else the

utilitarian criterion could not consistently be employed. This is true
despite the exogeneity of population growth, and quite aside from any

problems of intergenerational discounting.
An alternative is to require more stringent conditions on the

sequence of utility changes. Clearly no policy exists that would improve

the utility of all individuals in all states, unless the capital accumulation
program is Inefficient. Some type of ex ante expected utility measure
seen)s appropriate.
The utility of each generation depends on the initial circumstances
into which it is born, and on the events during its lifetime. But viewed

-3

14

from the date at which the policy is to be implemented, these initial
circumstances are also random variables, depending upon events in

the intervening period. Thus the appropriate expected utility for a
given generation is as viewed from the date at which the new policy
is formulated.

If a social insurance policy is Pareto improving in this sense,
then all individuals in the original position would prefer to have it
implemented regardless of into which generation they were (eventually)

born.

Is an intergenerational transfer scheme that is mutually beneficial

in this ex ante sense always feasible? If so, vihat are its characteristics?
Before answering this question analytically in the next section, we pause

to discuss the problem in more general terms. On the surface, the
answer to the feasibility question should be positive. The risks to each

pair of generations are inversely related. Therefore, an agreement that
reduces the effective wage below the competitive level when fertility is
low, increasing the yield to capital, and which reverses the direction of
the compensation in the high fertility case, would apparently result in
the same mean payoff to each agent while reducing ita variability. Utility
being concave in consumption and indirect expected utility being concave

in first-period income, this arrangement is apparently sure to succeed.
Unfortunately, however, matters are not quite this simple. If we
want to subsidize/tax the old people according to a function b(n) per capita,

where n is the ratio of young to old, the required tax/subsidy on the young

must be -b(n) in order for the government's budget to balance.

The

subsidy function, b(), must be decreasing in n in order to reduce
rather than increase risks. Therefore revenue to be raised through

15

taxes on the young would be higher when there are few of them, and per

capita taxes would therefore be adversely intensified. High total taxes
would be borne by fewer.young workers, and high total subsidies would

be spread out over many. For lack of a better term, we will call this
the population-bias effect.

The population-bias effect builds in an inherent problem for such

social insurance schemes. There is still one additional problem to be
overcome. When the gross return to capital exceeds the rate of population growth1 it is well known that social insurance on a pay-as-you-go

basis reduces savmgs4and is therefore unambiguously harmful in the

long run. If this form of risk pooling were to reduce savings, similar
effects would arise.
The problem therefore is to determine when and if the potential
benefits from risk pooling can outweigh the population—bias effect and

the depressed savings effect, if the latter is operative. An analytical
model of this is given in the next section.

Mutual Social Insurance Between Two Adjacent Generations

A. Conditions for Pareto Improving Smallt Contracts
Our analysis follows the standard lines of the two-period lifetime
overlapping generations model as introduced by Samuelson (1958)

except that the ratio of the population sizes between adjacent generations

is a random variable. A generation born at date t, called "generation ti"
is assumed to consist of identical indfriduals with homothetic preferences
for their present and future consumption. Generation t provides labor
inelastically at date t, and makes a decision regarding consumption at
that date. The excess of labor earnings over consumption is saved. At
date t+1, the size of the new working generation is determined. The
ratio of this generation's size to that of generation t is denoted n. After
the realization of n. the marginal product of capital is determined1 and
gene ration Vs consumption at date t+1 consists of the principal and

interest on their savings. All markets are assumed to be competitive.
Let
(1)
be

ut(c,c)

-

the utility function for members of generation t (y stands for young,

and r stands for retired).
Production is specified by a neoclassical constant returns to scale

technology. The function f(k) gives output per unit of labor as it
depends on the capital labor ratio at time t.
We will consider a social insurance scheme1 eb(n)1 which represents the transfer to each retired individual of generation t-1 when the
realized growth rate is n. As discussed in the previous section, this

17

implies a tax of — eb(nt) on the members of generation t in order to
maintain a balanced budget for the government.

The social insurance scheme is implemented at date 0, after the
birth of generation zero, but before they have made their savings

decisions. We assume in this section that the insurance scheme is
terminated at date 1, after the realization of n1 and after the transfers
have been carried out as required.

We think of e as a small positive number, in order to represent
a small change from an initial laissez-faire position. By differentiating

with respect to c we can discover whether such small systems
move ex ante expected utilities in a Pareto improving direction.
The principle datum of the system from the point of view of mem-

bers of generation 0 is the capital-labor ratio that they inherit, k0.
Competitive behavior in the labor market determines their wage w0.
If the agents in generation zero choose a consumption level of

cyo

for

that period, their future consumption is given by
(2)

cro(ni) =(w0_c 0)(1+f'(°'°)) +cb(n1).
Each agent behaves competitively with respect Lo his savings-

consumption choice, however. That is, they each regard the argument
of f', k1(n1), as a fixed random variable, independent of their own
choice of

-

cyo.

To simplify the analysis we will assume that utility is additively

that is, when no intergenerational transfers

are being made. Let c0(n1) be the corresponding consumption in the
retirement period as given by (2).
The expected utility of generation 0 increases with respect to e when
(8)

rr

E u'(c°0(n1)) b(n1) > 0.
The welfare of generation 1 is harder to evaluate. The change in
dc*

generation 0's consumption, de which determines the change in the
capital stock at date 1, induces only second-order changes in the welfare

of generation 0. But since the marginal contribution of capital at date 1
to the expected utility of generation 1 is positive, the introduction of the

19

policy induces first-order welfare variations in their utility through this

route as well as through the changes in risk characteristics of the
attainable consumption plans.

In general it is possible that the beneficial effects of the reduction
in risk may outweigh a utility loss imposed by a reduction in the stock of

capital. Let us begin, however, by asking for stronger requirements,
namely both that savings increase and that generation 1 should be better
off even with a constant savings level due to an improved risk situation.

We will return to the more general possibility at the end of this section.

To ascertain the change in savings in an initially laissez-faire

situation, we totally differentiate (7) at c 0, obtaining

The denominator of (9) is negative under the hypothesis that the

equilibrium attained at date 0, given by (6) and (7), is locally stable. Therefore,' savings will increase only if the numerator of (9) is positive,
under our assumptions.
If we were to assume that E b =

Therefore (10) is positive and, together with the hypotheses

generations in an economy with constant relative risk aversion, we will

have to allow for Eb<0. This serves to complicate matters because (13)
forms a simple sufficient condition for the positivity of (8). More generally,

we will have to regard (8) as a constraint to be checked for the particular
candidate b(•), a test which may depend upon the precise distribution of n1.

The constant relative risk aversion family has an interesting

property in this regard: Whenever b(S) is such that savings are
changed with respect to c, utility is unchanged as well. Moreover, this
result is independent of the distribution of n1 and of the production

It can be verified directly by noting that

for all n1, where a is the parameter of the utility

fore, (8) and the numerator of (9) are identical up to a (negative) multiplicative constant.
11 (8) and (9) are bath non-negative, then the only remaining

condition necessary to have a mutually beneficial policy is that the

expected marginal utility of the transfer increase. The initial marginal
utilities of income are those associated with the wage rates at the initial
values of k1(n1), in the absence of taxation. A member of generation 1
will face the problem

max U (cy1.w1cy1(1+f'(-)))

where

Letting U(n1) be the indirect marginal utility of income, w1, in the
problem (15), the criterion is
(16)

111

since the transfer to a typical member of generation I is -b(n1)
n1

Thus, (8) and (16) together with the negativity of (9) assure that

the policy is valuable to members of generations 0 and 1.

22

There is one further point to be noted, however. The policy we
have considered determines transfers at date 1 between these two

generations only. After that time it is assumed to be terminated. But
this does not mean that the effects of the policy are non-existent beyond
this date. The savings of generation 1 will surely be affected by the

realization of n1 and its associated transfer. This will affect the welfare of generation 2, and all subsequent generations.

The induced change in generation l's savings has a different char-

acter than that for generation 0. The savings of generation 0 are
determined ex ante, before any realization of uncertain events,
but the savings of generation 1 is

a random variable, depending

on the realization of w1(n1). As long as the marginal propensity to save
out of wage income is not zero throughout the range of n1 (an irrelevant

possibility) there will be some change in the stochastic process through
which the capital stock is determined over time.
Under the hypotheses with which we have been working, the

stochastic process determining the capital labor ratio at each date is a
Markov chain. This can be proven as follows.
In order to show that (kt) is Markovjan1 we demonstrate that
kt÷l is functionally related to kt and

Independence of (nt) then

assures this result. The per capita savings of each member of
generation t,

depends

on his labor income, which is just a function

of kt. If there are Nt members of this generation, their total savings

is therefore Kt+l = Ntst. But kt+l = NKt÷l
result.

t+.l

=

nt • which is the desired

23

Since the policy we have been considering is terminated at time I,

the Markov chain (k)2

evolves according to the probability laws

derived above. The expected utility of members of generations 2 and

later, being merely a function of kt at the date of their birth, we can say
that their ex ante expected utility depends only on the distribution of the

random variable kt. The social insurance policy affects this by changing

the initial probability distribution of k2. And1 as argued above, the distribution of k2 would shift due to generation l's transfer payment,
-b(n1) as well as through changes in k1.
1

Under the assumption that savings is a normal good, the distribution of k2 after the implementation of the social insurance scheme

will not bear a stochastic dominance relationship to that before it.

Neither, therefore, will there be an unambiguous relation for any of

the kt. t > 2. In order to evaluate the effect of the transfer program on
generations alive only after its implementation has been completed, we
need to know more about individuals' risk aversion toward initial
income, the production function and the underlying distribution of nt.

Before pursuing this question in more generality, we present an
example illustrating the impossibility of creating a welfare—impràvng
policy for members of both generations 0 and 1 in an important special

case.

Because of this result, there is clearly no welfare—improving

policy for all generations, and we need not investigate the issue of the

longer run residual effects of the transfer scheme discussed above.

B. Impossibility of Successful Intergenerational Risk Pooling

As a benchmark, though a somewhat unfortunate one, we consider
the case in which
(17)

ut(c.crt) = a log cyt + (1-a) log c.

(18)

f(kt)=k

0<<1.

We observed above that if Eu,(c0)b(n1) = 0, then both savings nd the
utility of generation zero are constant with respect to e. Using (17) and
(18) this condition is

Thus, using (14) and (20) the fact that, by the optimality of his consumption choice, U = u(°1), we have

as the condition for ex ante expected utility improvement for generation 1.

Assuming that b is continuous, it must be zero at some value of
n1, say n1; for if b were one-signed, then (19) would be obviously

25

impossible. Moreover, b'(n1) < 0 is required to insure the second-order
condition for a welfare improvement for generation 0.
Multiply (19) by the constant

as the condition for welfare improvement. It is apparent, however, that
(22) is false since by definition b(n1) > 0 if and only if n1 <ri1, so that

the integrand will be everywhere positive. There is, therefore, no
social insurance scheme capable of benefiting both generations in this
example.

C. Logarithmic Utility but More General Production
The methods of the previous section can be employed to derive
sufficient conditions on the production function to admit welfare-

improving policies. The zero-savings change/zero utility changefor
generation 0 condition, analogous to (17) is
(23)

In order to show that (23) and (24) are compatible with a function b

satisfying b' C

it is sufficient to show that the elasticity of

the elasticity of (25) is greater than that of (26), its slope at

(algebraically) lower. Moreover, if this relation between elasticities
held everywhere then there could be no other value of n1 at which (25),
multiplied by this factor, equals (26). Thus subtracting this multiple of
(25) from (26) we would find that the result is negative if and only if
b(n1) is positive, so that (24) is satisfied. Indeed, this would show that
(24) would hold for

function b() satisfying (23) and b' C 0, inde-

pendent of the distribution of n1.

which can be written straightforwardly as

where a is the elasticity of substitution of the production function f.
As a sufficient condition for the possibility of a successful social

insurance scheme, (28) expresses the fact that if the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently low, both future interest rates and future wage
levels will be so variable with respect to population that each generation

would willingly insure the other to some extent, even at actuarily unfair

odds. It is important to keep in mind that (28) is required to hold for all
values of k within the range that is induced through variations in n1. In
the Cobb-Douglas case studied above, where a E 1, the right-hand side
of (28) can be written as
(29)

_______
+ kFW

which varies from 1 to j3 as Ic goes from 0 to co. This explains why
mutually beneficial social insurance schemes do not exist in that case for any

distribution of n1.5 With a capital output ratio of 3 and a marginal

product of capital in the range of .09 to .12, the corresponding upper

bound on a is about 1/3. Since this is surely not relevant for the present
technology, within the range of possible future values of Ic, there is no

28

realistic possibility of mutually advantageous social insurance of this

type if logarithmic preferences accurately describe individuals' attitudes toward risk.

D. Other Forms for Utility
The essentially pessimistic conclusions of the previous sections

night be different if individuals were to display a higher degree of risk
aversion. If we are to maintain the strategy of keeping both the savings
and utility of generation 0 constant and then ascertain whether generation

1 can be made better off by virtue of an improved risk posture alone, we

must use the constant relative risk aversion form of utility as discussed
in section 4A. This utility, however1 has the following unfortunate

property: If we consider members of this class in which risk aversion
is stronger1 these also imply a negative response of savings to the rate

of interest.
Recent empirical work (Wright [1969); Boskin [19761)

indicates that just the opposite is true. But the constant relative risk.
aversion utility functions that would be consistent with this fact are
precisely those for which even more stringent conditions than (28) on
the elasticity of substitution would be required.

29

5. Conclusion
The

results of this paper being primarily discouraging, should not

dissuade us from studying more general types of social insurance

policies. It is important to investigate policies that are not of a pay-asyou-go sort. When the government can absorb part of the risk of population fluctuations by running a publicly held deficit, or by investing
surplus tax receipts in capital, much better ex ante welfare improvements

are possible. Stokey (1977) has studied a model like this for intergenerational risk spreading involving productivity. The great difficulty
with this formalization is that the feasibility condition for the stochastic
debt policy required is not obvious.

Finally, it is important to note that the results of this paper are
only "local." The effects of social insurance schemes that depart
drastically from the laissez-faire solution are certainly worth our
attention. Non-convexities inherent in the model make this task difficult.

Cross-section and time theories estimates of the aggregate elasti-

city of substitution differ widely. Typically, the former are much higher

than the latter. The interested reader is referred to Brown (1967) and
Lucas (1969).

The difference between terminal values of wealth is further

accentuated by the difference in the value of annuities at the interest rate

prevailing at the date of retirement. This rate is positively correlated
with the value of wealth, since interest rates vary with the (slowly chang-

ing) population structure. The computation in the text uses a 15-year
annuity to cover retirement consumption, and assumes that the rate of
interest is the average that prevailed during the generations working

lifetime.
The maintained assumptions underlying this table are:

1. $100-per family annual value of uncertainty reduction, for
workers and retirees in the 20-year savings horizon case and

for workers in the 15-year savings horizon case. For retirees
under the. 15-year average holding period of savings, it was set

at $80 per family per year.

2. Theretirement horizon is 15 years.
3. Every cohort enters the labor force at age 20 and works
until age 65.

31

4. Assumptions about numbers of families per cohort are as
given in the text.

The amounts shown are all in millions of dollars or millions of

dollars per year, except per family values. All benefits accruing
between now and 2025 are not reported.

This point can be disputed if private intergenerational transfers
are widespread. See Barro (1974) and Feldstein (1976).
