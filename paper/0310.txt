Summary
Domestic Saving and International Capital Flows
Martin Feldstein
Charles Horioka

This paper uses new statistical estimates to compare two views of international capital mobility.

With perfect world capital mobility, there would

be little or no relation between the amount of saving generated in a country
and the domestic investment in that country.

In contrast, if portfolio

preferences and institutional rigidities impede the flow of long-term capital
among countries, increases in domestic saving would be reflected primarily in
additional domestic investment.

The statistical evidence presented here on

the relation between domestic investment and saving implies that the truth lies
closer to the second view than to the first.

International differences in

domestic savings rates among major industrial countries have resulted in almost
equal corresponding differences in domestic investment rates.
The paper discusses the compatability of this evidence with the obvious
international mobility of short-term liquid capital and with the existence of
substantial international flows of long-term portfolio and direct investments.
There is a brief discussion of the relevance of the new evidence for the
optimal national saving policy and for the analysis of tax incidence.

Domestic Saving and International Capital Flows
Martin Feldstein*
Charles Horioka**

How internationally mobile is the world's supply of capital?

Does

capital flow among industrial countries to equalize the yield to investors?
Alternatively, does the saving that originates in a country remain to be
invested there?

Or does the truth lie somewhere between these two extremes?

The answers to these questions are not only important for understanding the
international capital market but are also critical for analyzing a wide range
of issues including the nation's optimal rate of saving and the incidence of
tax changes.

International Capital Mobility:

Significance and Limitations

Before turning to our empirical analysis, it is useful to consider in
more detail the implication of international capital mobility for these major
questions of policy and analysis.

Consider first the problem of determining

In a closed economy, the national return on addi-

tional saving is the domestic marginal product of capital.

The question of

whether the government should pursue policies to increase the saving rate is

therefore equivalent to deciding whether this domestic marginal product of
capital offers a high enough reward to justify postponing consumption.

1

Although the net yield that individual investors receive is lowered by taxes
on capital income, the nation as a whole receives both the after-tax yield
and the tax revenue; it is this pretax marginal product of capital that
should influence national saving policy in a closed economy.
In contrast, if capital is perfectly mobile between countries, most of
any incremental saving will leave the home country (if it is already a capital
exporter) or will replace other foreign source capital that would otherwise
be invested in the home country (if it is already a capital importer).

In

this case, the yield to the home country on the additional saving is only the
net-of-tax return received by the investor and not the pretax marginal
product of capital.

If the additional saving is invested abroad, the foreign

governments collect the additional tax revenue.

If the additional saving

reduces capital imports into the home country, the tax revenue of the domestic
government remains unchanged and national income rises only by the after-tax
return to investors.

Since after-tax real yields are only about 50 percent

of the pretax yield, the optimal savings policy is likely to depend critically
on whether the "closed economy" or the "perfect world capital market" is a
better approximation to reality.

2

For the United States, a pre-tax yield of

10 to 12 percent may be a convincing reason for more saving while a post-tax
yield of 5 to 6 percent may be much less compelling.

lThis argument is discussed in Feldstein (1977); Feldstein and Summers
(1977) estimate that the domestic marginal product of corporate capital is
between 10 percent and 12 percent.
2

The issue is more complex if there are no capital flows but trade flows
respond to changes in domestic factor proportions.

- 3 -

The extent of capital mobility is also crucial for the analysis of tax
incidence.

In the modern literature on public finance, the theoretical and

empirical studies of tax incidence have assumed a closed economy.

1

It is

easy to see, however, that the results obtained in such an analysis would be
radically altered by replacing this assumption with a model of perfect capital
mobility.

For example, in the familiar model of a closed economy with a

fixed capital stock, a tax on the income of all capital used in production
is borne completely by the owners of capital.

But if capital is free to

leave the country, a very large part of the burden could be shifted to domestic

Similarly, a corporate income tax

would tend to be borne less by capital and more by domestic labor to the
extent that capital is freely mobile across national boundaries.

Moreover,

, labor's ability to shift a tax on labor income to domestic owners of capital
\by a reduction in labor supply would be less if capital is free to escape

\

abroad.

Statistical evidence in favor of the complete world capital mobility

assumption would thus require a major revision of our theories of tax
.incidence.
The view that capital flows among countries to equate net-of-tax rates of
return seems at first to be the most reasonable.

It is clear from the yields

on short-term securities in the Eurocurrency market and the forward prices of
those currencies that liquid financial capital moves very rapidly to arbitrage
such short-term international yield differentials.

Unfortunately, similar

measures of expected real net-of-tax yields on long-term portfolio capital

or direct investments cannot be observed.

l

It nevertheless may seem plausible

that long-term capital movements would also equalize net-of-tax yields since
the failure to do so would leave unexploited opportunities for profit.

There

are however reasons to be skeptical about the extent of such long-term arbitrage. .First, the assumption that investment will flow to the highest
yielding opportunity is only one extreme form of the portfolio theory of
investment.

More generally, since the risks of investing in different coun-

tries and currencies are not perfectly correlated, individual and corporate
investors will tend to choose a portfolio in which expected yields are.not
equal.

For most investors, the uncertainties and risks associated with

foreign investment are perceived as so great that investment is restricted
to the domestic economy.

These risk aversion considerations become increas-

ingly important for longer-term and less liquid investments, implying that
short-term liquid asset arbitrage is consistent with much less mobile longterm capital.

2

If the aggregate portfolio demand functions are not very

sensitive to yield differentials, major changes in national saving rates or

lHarberger (1978) has estimated rates of return on the total capital

rates; the range among developed countries is between 4.4%

housing capital stock which is largely imputation rather than market evidence;
since housing accounts for roughly half of fixed capital, the overall return
will be quite sensitive to the return that local national income accountants
(impute on housing. Harberger provides no evidence on the relative importance
(of capital flows, trade flows and domestic savings responses in any movement
'~oward an equalizing of rates of return.
2Even if long-term capital is not internationally mobile, the yields on
long-term assets could be equalized indirectly if short-term assets are arbitraged internationally and assets of all maturities are arbitraged domestically.
But even within domestic markets, such arbitraging is far from perfect because
of portfolio considerations. An inflow of short-term capital is thus likely
to widen the differential between short and long domestic interest rates and
to limit itself by depressing the forward discount on the domestic currency.

in tax rates can occur without inducing substantial international capital
flows.

1

Second, even if all investors were well informed and eager to seek the
highest yield without regard to risk, the full mobility of capital would be
impeded by official restrictions on the export of capital.

Moreover, the

fear of future capital export controls by potential host countries or adverse
changes in their taxation of foreign investment may deter investors from
putting capital there.
Third, important institutional rigidities

also tend to keep a large

The most obvious of these in the United

States is the saving institutions that are required by law to be invested in
mortgages on local real estate.

American insurance companies and some other

financial institutions have large liabilities that are denominated in dollars
and therefore seek to limit their risk by investing in dollar assets.

Pension

funds and other fiduciaries that are legally governed by the "prudent man"
rule may be unwilling to invest abroad.

2

'Vinally, there is indirect evidence in the pattern of investment flows
that capital does not move to maximize each investor's net-of-tax return.
Because of international differences in tax rules and the interaction of

IEliminating international yield differentials would not, of course,
require all investors to be willing to invest wherever the expected yield is
highest. Yields could be arbitraged if sufficient capital were invested on a
yield maximizing basis. But the existence of some risk neutral investors is
obviously not sufficient for arbitrage; they could specialize their investment
while yield differentials persist.
2If these restrictions prevent households from taking advantage of very
much higher yields abroad, thrift institutions and other restricted intermediaries would lose deposits in favor of higher yielding alternatives. Moreover, these restricted funds are irrelevant if there are enough mobile funds

foreign and domestic taxation, net return maximization implies a very
different pattern of investment flows from what it would imply if there were
no taxes.

Without taxes, the gross returns would be equal in all countries

and each individual investor would be indifferent about where he places his
funds.

But with existing tax rules, investors should specialize their

investment in a particular country that is often different from the investor's
home country.

1

The absence of such specialization is an indication that

portfolio considerations or restrictions on capital movement prevent capital
from flowing to maximize each investor's net return.
Much of the direct investment in foreign markets appears to be associated
with implementing marketing strategies, exploiting production knowledge, or
overcoming trade restrictions rather than with an undifferentiated pursuit of
profit opportunities.

2

This is probably the major reason why individual

countries are both importers and exporters of capital.

3

It implies that

substantial flows of direct investment may exist even if they are not responsive to changes in domestic taxation or relative capital supplies.
In the end, the issue must be settled empirically.

The current paper

provides direct evidence on the relationship between domestic savings and

lFor example, a u.s. individual who wishes to invest in bonds and believes
that purchasing power parity will prevail in the long-run and that Germany
will have a lower rate of inflation should invest in German bonds but not in
U.S. bonds because the return that comes in the form of the appreciation of
the dollar value of the principal of the bond will be taxed as capital gains
rather than ordinary income; equal pre-tax yields imply different post-tax
yields. If market forces make pre-tax yields unequal, some u.s. investors
would maximize total net yield by specializing in German bonds while others
would maximize total net yield by specializing in U.S. bonds.

capital to and receives comparable amounts of investment from a number of
major countries.

international capital flows.

The statistical estimates indicate that nearly

all of incremental saving remains in the country of origin.

These results are

quite incompatible with the assumption of complete arbitrage in a perfect
world capital market.

Large flows of liquid capital may arbitrage short-term

interest rates while direct investment flows may exploit profitable sales
opportunities, but additions to the domestic supply of capital do not appear
to move abroad in search of the maximum return.

Specification and Data
This paper uses data on the major industrial countries to measure the

extent to which a higher domestic saving rate in a country is associated
with a higher rate of domestic investment.

With perfect world capital

mobility, there should be no relation between domestic saving and domestic
investment:

saving in each country responds to the worldwide opportunities

for investment while investment in that country is financed by the worldwide
pool of capital.

Conversely, if incremental saving tends to be invested in

the country of origin, differences among countries in investment rates should
correspond closely to differences in saving rates.
There is in fact substantial variation in domestic saving rates among the

DECD countries that are the focus of the study.

For the period 1960 to 1974

as a whole, the ratio of gross domestic saving to gross domestic product
averaged 0.250 for the 21 DECD countries for which data are available.

1

This

saving rate varied from a high of 0.372 in Japan to a low of 0.184 in the
United Kingdom.

The standard deviation was 0.045.

The pattern of high and low savings rate countries has remained quite
stable over this period.

To measure this stability, we divided the sample

into three five-year periods and calculated the correlation of saving rates
between pairs of sample periods.

The correlations

among the investment ratios in the three 5-year periods are: 0.937 between
1960-64 and 1965-69, 0.884 between 1965-69 and 1970-74, and 0.864 between
1960-64 and 1970-74.
The mean savings and investment ratios from the full 15 year period are
presented in the first two columns of Table 1.
To assess the relation between savings rates and investment rates we
estimated equations of the form:

where (I/Y). is the ratio of gross domestic investment to gross domestic

product in country i and (S/Y)i is the corresponding ratio of gross domestic
saving to gross domestic product.

using average ratios for the entire period as well as for subperiods.

Before turning

to these more general specifications, it is useful to discuss the interpretation of this basic equation.
With perfect world capital mobility, an increase in the saving rate in
country i would cause an increase in investment in all countries; the distribution of

thQ~cremental

capital among countries would vary positively with

each country's initial capital stock and inversely with the elasticity of the country's marginal product of capital schedule.

economy, the value of S implied by perfect world capital mobility would be
zero.

But even for a relatively large country, the value of S would only be

of the order of magnitude of its share of total world capital.

The true value

of S would thus vary among the DEeD countries but would average less than 0.10.
In contrast, estimates of S close to one would indicate that most of the
incremental saving in each country has remained there.

Note that a finding

that S is close to one might reflect the fact that domestic saving and
domestic investment are both stimulated by a high rate of return but that
this interpretation is inconsistent with the hypothesis of perfect world
capital mobility; with perfect capital mobility, the domestic saving rate
does not depend on the domestic investment opportunities.

Note also that the

assumption of perfect capital mobility is inconsistent with the traditional
Keynesian interpretation that exogenous changes in the level of investment
cause income to vary until the resulting savings level equals investment;
whatever the validity of this argument for a closed economy, it is inappropriate if domestic saving is added to the worldwide pool of capital.

It is

of course possible that a high observed value of S could reflect other common
causes of the variation in both saving and investment.

The findings of a

high value of S would however be strong evidence against the hypothesis of
perfect world capital mobility and would place on the defenders of that
hypothesis the burden of identifying such common causal factors.
Although equation 1 measures the extent of world-wide capital mobility by
analyzing domestic saving and investment, the equation can also be interpreted
in terms of foreign investment flows.

Since the excess of gross domestic

investment over gross domestic saving is equal to the net inflow of foreign

- 12 -

investment,l a regression of the ratio of net foreign investment inflow to
GDP on the domestic savings ratio would have a coefficient of 8-1.

Testing

the hypothesis that B equals one is therefore equivalent to testing the hypothesis that the international capital flows do not depend on domestic savings
rates.
It is important to stress that the identity of national saving and investment does not imply equality of

domesti~

saving and. investment.

Because of

international capital flows, domestic saving and investment can differ for
very long periods of time.

For example, during much of the nineteenth century,

British domestic saving exceeded domestic investment while Britain invested
abroad.

The third column of Table 1 shows the average difference between

domestic saving and domestic investment as a fraction of GDP in each country
over the 15 year sample period.

The average absolute value of these differ-

ences was 1.3 percent of GDP and their standard deviation was 1.5 percent of
GDP.

The fourth column of Table 1 presents the 15 year averages of the

differences between saving and investment expressed as a percentage of saving.
The absolute differences averaged 5.2 percent of gross saving with a standard
deviation of 6.1 percent.
Our analysis focuses on gross saving and investment rather than savings
and investment net of depreciation for two basic reasons.

First, it is the

gross flow of savings that is, in principle, free to move from country to
country in response to yield differentials.

Second, the accounting defini-

tions of depreciation are very imperfect, especially when there is significant
inflation; errors of measurement in the depreciation estimates would cause a

1Exce~t

for the official statistical discrepency. It also follows from
the national income identities that the net inflow of foreign investment is
equal to the current account deficit.

- 13 -

spurious correlation between net saving and investment.

Net investment is

nevertheless of interest because it is equivalent to the growth of the capital
stock.

Although the results presented in the following sections generally

deal with gross saving and investment, all of the coefficients have also been
estimated for net flows as well.

The parameter estimates are quite similar.

The coefficients based on net flows are generally slightly higher, reflecting
the common measurement error noted above.
From the basic sample of 21 OEeD countries for which data are available
for all years between 1960 and 1974, five have been deleted because they
l
switched their method of national income accounting during the period.

When

some of the regressions were estimated using the entire 21 country sample,
the coefficients were very similar to the sample of 16 countries that had an
un~hanged

accounting method.

The analysis of the disaggregated components

of saving and investment by sectors in section 4 requires a further reduction
in the sample because of the limited data provided by some countries.

1

The countries that switched were France, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and
Switzerland.

Basic Results
The basic estimates of equation 1 are presented in Table 2.

The estimate

of S for the entire 15 year sample is 0.89 (s.e.=0.07) when gross saving and
investment are used and 0.94 (s.e.=0.09) when net saving and investment are
used.

Neither coefficient is significantly different from one while both are

obviously incompatible with the hypothesis that the true value of

B is zero.

The coefficients for each of the five-year subperiods is similar to the
overall coefficient.

In short, the evidence strongly contradicts the hypo-

thesis of perfect world capital mobility and indicates that most of any
incremental saving tends to remain in the country in which the saving is done.
i/The substantial international capital flows that exist thus do not appear to
"""respond to international differences in saving rates.
The savings rate coefficients based on the net flows are higher than the
corresponding coefficients based on gross flows.

As we indicated in the

previous section, errors in measuring depreciation are likely to cause a
spurious correlation that causes an upward bias in the net flow coefficients.
A consistent estimate can nevertheless be obtained with instrumental variable
estimation by using as an instrument a variable that is correlated with net
saving but uncorre1ated with the measurement error in depreciation.

The

obvious candidate for this variable is the gross saving rate since it involves
no estimate of depreciation but is likely to be highly
net saving.

The instrumental variable estimates of

corre1~ted

with true

B are all lower than the

ordinary least squares estimates of Table 2 but the difference is never as
large as 0.1.

For the overall 15 year period, the coefficient falls from

0.938 (s.e.=0.091) to 0.867 (s.e.=0.102).

Thus using instrumental variable

estimation does not alter the conclusion that domestic investment absorbs

To assess this, we estiThe coefficient of the

squared value of sly is always statistically insignificant and positive.

For

the entire 15 year period, the coefficient of this variable is 0.432 with a
standard error of 1.146.

There is clearly no indication of nonlinearity.

As we noted above, the high coefficient in the relation between domestic
investment and domestic saving may reflect the impact of some third variable.
According to the life cycle theory of saving, the most important exogenous
determinant of the aggregate saving rate is the rate of population growth.

1

A higher rate of population growth might also increase the rate of investment.
However, adding the mean annual growth rate of population as an additional
variable in equation 1 had almost no effect on the estimated value of S; the
coefficient of the growth variable was itself very small and statistically
quite insignificant.

There may of course be other variables that independently

influence both saving and investment; although we do not pursue this question
here, further analysis would clearly be desirable.
We have also examined the possibility that the link between domestic
investment and domestic saving varies with the degree of openness of the
economy.

It seems plausible that small economies that engage in substantial

international trade will have a much weaker link between domestic saving and
domestic investment than large and nearly autarchic

to either the size of the economy or the importance of international trade.
This completes the description of our analysis of the aggregate crosscountry estimates.

countries to equalize yields.

Components of Saving and Investment
For 9 of the countries, the OECD disaggregates total saving into th,ree

components: household saving, corporate saving and government saving.

1

This disaggregation is important because it makes it possible to see whether
domestic investment is equally responsive to all types of saving.

To the

extent that this is so, it is less likely that the high value of S represents
some unobserved factor that increases both saving and investment.

The

sensitivity of total investment to the different types of saving is also
relevant for assessing policies that are designed to increase investment by
stimulating forms of saving.

The data for these countries also permit separ-

ating public and private investment and, within private investment, distinguishing household and corporate investment.

The

major difference among the three types of saving in their contt·ibu tion to
total investment or total private investment.

and quasi-corporate enterprises (including public).

level of corporate investment, there may be intranational barriers or portfolio
preferences that make corporate investment more responsive to corporate
saving than to other sources of funds.
Consider first the response of total gross investment.

The coefficient

of the aggregate rate is 0.957; the coefficients of household and government
saving are slightly higher than this (1.17 and 1.12) while the coefficient of
corporate saving is substantially lower (0.55).

However, with the small

sample of only 9 countries, these differences are not statistically significant.

The F-statistic for the hypothesis that the three coefficients are

equal is only 4.5 and therefore less than the 5 percent critical value of 5.8.
The coefficients for total net investment are even closer to each other and
clearly do not differ in a statistically significant way.

The results for

private saving are quite similar to the results for total saving: although
there is some variation among the coefficients, the differences are not
statistically significant.
Gross corporate investment appears to be most sensitive to gross corporate
saving and substantially less sensitive to household and government saving.
With the net concepts of investment and saving, the pattern is the same but
the differences among the coefficients are smaller and not statistically
significant.

The apparently greater sensitivity of corporate investment to

corporate saving may reflect institutional rigidities or portfolio preferences
within national economies.

Alternatively, the large coefficient may indicate

that corporations choose to save more in countries where corporate investment
is greater.

In either case, the evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis

of perfect world capital mobility.

Some Time Series Evidence
The evidence based on the cross-section of countries reflects the long-

term adjustment of domestic investment rates to the relatively stable differences in savings rates among countries.

Domestic investment may be much less

responsive to short-run variations in saving and a larger share of such
temporary changes in saving amy be reflected in international capital flows.
Because of the national income identities, this is equivalent to stating that
a larger share of the short-run fluctuations in the saving rate is reflected
in changes in imports and exports that alter the current account balance of
payments.
,
We have examined this question in two different ways: by relating changes
in investment to changes in saving, and by estimating individual time series
equations for each country.

similar ways.

Although the coefficient of 0.724 is somewhat lower than

estimated long-run value discussed in section 3, the difference is not very
substantial.

This evidence implies that domestic investment rates adjust

within a few years to changes in saving rates.

In addition to the basic specification of

equation 1, we estimated an equation in which the investment rate was related
to both the savings rate and the current cyclical condition of the economy as
measured by the ratio of actual GNP to trend GNP.

The coefficients for the United States, Germany and

Beyond that, it is difficult to discern any particular

patterns in the coefficients.

Further analysis of these differences would

clearly be desirable but would take us beyond the current paper's aim of
assessing the general validity of the perfect capital mobility hypothesis.
In concluding this section, it is important to emphasize that these timeseries coefficients reflect short-run responses and are not comparable to the
long-run equilibrium responses indicated by the cross-section coefficients
of previous sections.

The difference between the short-run and long-run

responses may reflect both lags in the response of physical investment and
the desire of financial institutions to keep transitory changes in saving
in a liquid form.

Conclusion
This paper has compared two views of the relation between domestic saving

and world capital mobility.

With perfect world capital mobility, there is

little or no relation between the domestic investment in a country and the
amount of savings generated in that country.

In contrast, if portfolio

preferences and institutional rigidities impede the flow of long-term capital
among countries, increases in domestic saving will be reflected primarily in
additional domestic investment.

The statistical evidence presented here on

the relation between domestic investment and saving implies that the truth
lies closer to the second view than to the first.

International differences

in domestic savings rates among major industrial countries have resulted in
almost equal corresponding differences in domestic investment rates.
It is important to emphasize that this conclusion is compatible with the
obvious international mobility of short-term liquid capital.

While a small

part of the total world capital stock is held in liquid form and is available
to eliminate short-term interest rate differentials, most capital is apparently not available for such arbitrage-type activity among long-term investments.

Similarly, our finding of the very close link between domestic saving

and investment does not conflict with the existence of substantial international flows of long-term portfolio and direct investments.
direct investment is

As the introductory section of this paper indicated, the evidence against
world capital mobility and in favor of a close relation between domestic
investment and saving is important in a number of ways.

First and most

directly, it sheds light on the true nature of the world capital market and
the character of existing long-term capital movements.

Second, it confirms

that it is appropriate, at least as an approximation, to study income distribution in general and tax incidence in particular with models that ignore
international capital mobility.

Finally, the evidence implies that the

\ national return on domestic saving is approximately equal to the pretax
\

\~omestic marginal product of capital since such saving does increase the

domestic capital stock rather than either flowing abroad or replacing foreign
investment at home.
