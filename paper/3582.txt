ASSESSING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT IN U.S. MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
ABSTRACT
In this paper we report results of an empirical assessment
of the cost reducing impacts of recent dramatic increases in
stocks of "high—tech" office and information technology equipment

(0) using annual data from various two digit US manufacturing
industries over the 1952—1986 time period.

While there are exceptions, on balance we find that in 1986,
estimated marginal benefits of investments in this 0 equipment
are less than marginal costs, implying over investment in 0

capital in 1986. Ihe sign of the estiaated elasticity of demand
for labor with respect to changes in the stock of 0 capital is
evenly divided in the fourteen industries, but whether positive
or negative, in all industries this elasticity increases in
absolute magnitude over time, indicating ever greater impacts of

0 capital on the demand for aggregate labor. Finally, our
estimates of the elasticity of technical progress with respect to

0—capital are very small in magnitude implying that increases in
o capital have only a small impact on technical progreaa.

INTRODUCTION
The last two decades have witnessed an explosion in the amount of Thigh

tech" computer power and inforatation technology equipment purchased by

American firms and businesses. Yet it has been difficult to establish that
the extent of such investments can ho rationalized in terms of realised cost

savings. Indeed, a common perception is that this dramatic increase in office
and information technology equipment has not had a commensurate impact on
firms' cost and productivity performance. As Martin N. Boily and Robert 3.

Gordon have described this situation ",.

In this paper we report results obtained in a study based on the

economic theory of cost and production that atteapto to assess the shadow
value of office and information technology equipment in U.S. manufacturing
industries, that quantifies the effects of this equipment on the demand for
labor and other inputs, and that examines the relationship between changes in
the stocks of this equipment and technical progress.

Precisely how one identifies and documents cost savings attained by
investments in computer power is not clear. Within a given establishment, for
cxaaplo, cost savings achieved in one division or line of business might be
offset by increased costs in another; further comptexities con emerge for
multi-establishment firms. Pcesunshiy, therefore, it makes more sense to look
for cost reductions at the overall firm level, or perhaps even at an aggregate
industry level. The lack of sufficiently reliable data at the iirei level,

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND PRODUCTIVITY CROWTR

however, suggests that analyses of the

effects

of investment in computer power

might by necessity be confined to aggregate industry studies.

At the industry level, official productivity statistics indicate that
over the last fifteen years the prcductivity growth record of US manufacturing
industries has been much better than that for non-manufacturing industries,2
due perhsps to difficult ptoblema in measuring output in con-manufacturing

industries, especially in the service sectori. If investments in office and
information technology equipment have been prcductive, and given that the
manufacturing industries have demonstrated core rapid productivity growth, one
could argue that one would he most likely to identify and measure the effects
ef office and information technology investments by examining the productivity

performance within and between various manufacturing industries.3 That is
what we attempt to accomplish in this paper.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follcwa. In Section II we
provide some further background discussion, in Section III we outline the
theoretical

framework, in

Section IV we present empirical findings, and in

Section V we aummarize and suggest avenues for further research.

A great deal of research and discussion has taken place en documenting

end interpreting the effects of the expiosico in computer power. For example,
Timothy Bresnahan [198€] has measured spillovers frcu mainframe computers in
financial services, Csry Loveman [t988[ has examined interactions between
information technology capital and lahor prndtictiv y growth at tiLe line-of-

Lester and Robert N. Solow [1990], Stephen S. Roach [1987]. and hy Lester C.
Thorow [1987].

aspects °f the explosion of computer power, to the best of our knowledge none

it is useful to begin by documenting the dramatic changes in

investment and capital deepening from 1976 to 1966.

Net enly has the aggregate capital-output ratio increased since 1976,
but

the composition of the aggregate capital stock has also changed

substantially. In particular, in all manufacturing industries, the (non hightech) equipment share of the aggregate capital stock has fallen, while the
share

of high-tech office and information technology equipment has increased,

often dramatically, e.g. ,

in

clay the 0 share has increased from 6 to 391, in

furniture and fixtures from 2 to l3Z, in printing and publishing from 9 to
43%, and in transportation equipment from 7 to 37%. The share of structures
in total fixed capital stock decreased in 12 of the 14 industries, and

increased slightly in the remainng two.
The increasing share of office and information technology equipnient in

manufacturing industries' total capital stock since 1976 reflects of course
the correspondingly increasing share of 0 in total investment. This is
demonstrated in the final three columns of Table 1, where it is seen that the
1986 share of 0 investment in total F + S + 0 inveateent is larger than the

corresponding share of 0 in the total E + S + 0 capital stock for all
industries except iron and steel. Moreover, in sose industries the 0 share of
total investment in 1986 is very large, e.g., 671 in clay and BOX in
machinery.

In brief, the invcstnent and capital stock data indicate quite clearly

industries, not only has the aggregate

capital-output ratio increased implying enhanced capital intensity, but the
share of office and information technology equipment in the total capital
stock has also increased chraaarically since 1976.

With this overview of data trends in mind, we now present a model in
which the impacts of these investments in 0 capital can be assessed
qoantitstively.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

To assess the impacts on costs and productivity of investment in office
and information technology capital (0), we employ the economic theory of cost

and production. More specifically, we begin by specifying a variable cost
function inclusive of adjustment costs, having the general form G(Y,t,x,Ax,p),
where x and Ax are 3x1 vectcrs denoting capital. stock levels and absolute
values of net investment in fixed inputs (E -other than 0, S --

As a functional form for C, we erspioy the generalized Leontief varieble

Six estimating equations are derived from this generalized Leontief

variable cost function. Specifically, three variable input demand equations

implied rate of investment reflects oC course the effects of internal

adjustment costs. An additive disturbance term is appended to each of these
six equations, and the resulting disturbance vector is assumed to be
identically and independently normally distributed with mean vector zero and
variance-covarfance matrix A.
The estimation method used is three-stage least squares (3SLS), with the

on our estimates of q by industry for selected years.
A complementary measure of the inpect of invcstnont in office and

Estimates of these elasticities will he presented in the following section of

The final measure we compute to evaluate the impact of office and
information technology equipment on costs and productivity refers to its

interaction with technical progress. Specifically, short-run techocial
progress can be evaluated by computing the partial derivative -3Gj3t, and then

When £to is positive (negative), increases in the stock of 0 accelerate

(decelerate) the rate of technical progress ceteris paribus. Note also that
an alternative interpretation oi this elasticity can be obtained by reversing
the order of the derivatives, in which case one assesses how the shadow value
of capital (-80/30) is affected by technical progress (30/at).7

estimated Tebin's q values, reported itt Table 2 below.

In the first four columns of Table 2, we report estimated Tobin's q

ratios at five-year intervals from 1971 to 1986, by industry. A number of
results are worth noting. first, in 1971 q was less than one in all but two
industries (where it was barely above nnity); the sample mean of the q's over
all fourteen industries in 1971 was 0.65.
Second, after 1971 there appears to be considerably greater variability

in the q ratios for 0 capital. Values of q in 1976 range from 0.68 to 1,91,
in 1991 from 0,24 to 2,56, and in 1966 from -1.80 to 4.96. The two industries
with very large q's in 1986 are fabricated metals (q —

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Our purpose in this paper has been to examine empirically the costreducing impacts of recent dramatic increases in stocks of high-tech' office
and information iechnology equipment using annual data from various two-digit
U.S. manufacturing industries over the 1952-4986 time period. Our theoretical
framework is based on the theory of cost and production. The empirical
specification we employ is that of a dynamic factor demand medol, with labor,
energy and non-energy intermediate materials as variable inputs, and office

and information technology equipment (0), non-0 producers' dutsble equipment
(E) and non-residential structures (S) es quasi-fixed inputs. For each
industry, we coaputod the ratio of marginal benefits of 0 investment to
marginel costs, and also calculated a number of related elasticities.

Our principal empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First,
our estimates of the benefit-cost (Tobin's q) ratios varied considerably aisong
industries (with increasing variability over Lime) ,

but

benefit-cost ratio across all industries was 0.90, and

in 1986 the average

if

five "outlier

industries were exciudod, this ratio fell to 0.79. It is worth noting hors
that rho denominator of the benefii-coet ratio is a rental price of capital,

which in our empirical formulation had the expected capital gains term set to
zero. Since the price of 0 equipment fell steadily and considerably over the
1952-86 time period, one might argue that an expectation of declining prices
should

be incorporated into the benefit-cost calculation. Had we incorporated

the capital gains (in this case, capital lassos) tens into the rental price
formula, the denominator of the benefit-cost ratio would have been latger, and

thus the ratio would have been cven snaller, We conclude, therefore, that
while there are exceptions, on balance there appears to have been an

for example. the quarterly reports "Productivity and Costs issued by
the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
31t is worth noting here, however, that when the U.S. Bureau of the Census
obtains data from manutacturing establishments the only data it collects is
on its production activities; in particular, the Census data does not include
date from central office operations, marketing activities, etc. This implies
that when one employs Census data, aa we do in this study, we coniine
ourselves to examining the effects of office and information technology
equuipmenr on production activities.

For an alternative formulation
there is no equation explicitly determining Y.

restrictions on the technology require that the variable cost
function be decreasing and concave in x, implying that, among other restrictions, it must be the case that 324/30 > 0.

7For further discussion of these two interpretations, see Morrison [i988bJ
It should also be noted that this elasticity takes into account the effects of
scale economies and the presence of quasi-fixed inputs. For futther
discussion, see Morrison [l989[

BLS publications are found in harper et al. [19891.

101n the BLS data base, the depreciation rates for each asset follow a
hyperbolic pattern and are not necessarily constant over time; depreciation
rates for the N, S and 0 composites also vary across industries arid time due
to changes in the composition of the stocks, In fact, however, the
depreciation rates tend to be very stab1c over tioe tot each assct. For 1986,
the capital stock-weighted average depreciation rates for N in the machinery,
chemicals and iron and steel iridustrics are approximately 6, 8 and 6%,

depreciation rates for these three industries are 17, 15 and 14%,
respectively.

sectors, additional cnnsLraints were imposed, and in some cases the saisple
