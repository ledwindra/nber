    "abstract": "\n\nWe evaluate reforms that integrated more stringent, biometric ID requirements into India\u2019s largest social protection program, using large-scale randomized and natural experiments. Corruption fell but with substantial costs to legitimate bene\ufb01ciaries, 1.5-2 million of whom lost access to bene\ufb01ts at some point during the reforms. Adverse e\ufb00ects appear to have been driven primarily by decisions about the way the transition was managed, illustrating both the risks of rapid reforms, and how the impacts of promising new technologies can be highly sensitive to the protocols governing their use.\n\n",
