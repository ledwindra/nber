ABSTRACT
We study a dynamic-contracting problem involving risk sharing between two parties — the Proposer
and the Responder — who invest in a risky asset until an exogenous but random termination time.
In any time period they must invest all their wealth in the risky asset, but they can share the underlying
investment and termination risk. When the project ends they consume their final accumulated wealth.
The Proposer and the Responder have constant UHODWLYH risk aversion 5 and U respectively, with 5>U>0.
We show that the optimal contract has three components: a non-contingent flow payment, a share
in investment risk and a termination payment. We derive approximations for the optimal share in
investmentrisk and the optimal termination payment, and we use numerical simulations to show that
these approximationsoffer a close fit to the exact rules. The approximations take the form of amyopic
benchmark plus adynamic correction. In the case of the approximation for the optimal share in
investmentrisk, the myopicbenchmark is simply the classical formula for optimal risk sharing. This
benchmark is endogenousbecause it depends on the wealths of the two parties. The dynamic correction
is driven by counterpartyrisk. If both parties are fairly risk tolerant, in the sense that 2>5>U, then the
Proposer takes on morerisk than she would under the myopic benchmark. If both parties are fairly
risk averse, in the sensethat 5>U>2, then the Proposer takes on less risk than she would under the
myopic benchmark. In themixed case, in which 5>2>U, the Proposer takes on more risk when the
Responder's share in total wealthis low and less risk when the Responder's share in total wealth is
high. In the case of the approximationfor the optimal termination payment, the myopic benchmark
is zero. The dynamic correction tellsus, among other things, that: (i) if the asset has a high return
then, following termination, the Respondercompensates the Proposer for the loss of a valuable
investment opportunity; and (ii) if the asset hasa low return then, prior to termination, the Responder
compensates the Proposer for the low returnsobtained. Finally, we exploit our representation of

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

Introduction

This paper considers a risk-sharing problem in which two investors pool their resources to
invest in a common risky venture. Investment returns are assumed to follow a geometric
Brownian motion, and the investors’ risk preferences are represented by utility functions
exhibiting constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA). The two investors have diﬀerent coefficients of relative risk-aversion and diﬀerent initial wealth endowments. They can write
a long-term insurance contract specifying a division of final output contingent on the
sample path of output of the venture. The venture may end at any time with positive
probability, and when it ends the two investors consume their final accumulated wealth.
To keep the analysis tractable we have stripped out of the model many features which
would make it more realistic. For example, our model allows for only two investors, only
one risky asset, and investors only consume at the end. In addition, we simplify the formulation of the optimal contracting problem by letting one individual, the Proposer, make
a take-it-or-leave-it contract oﬀer to the other, the Responder. Even so, the analysis of
this optimal contracting problem is suﬃciently complex that we are only able to approximate the optimal risk-sharing rule. For reasonable parameter configurations, however,
this approximation is a good fit for the numerically determined optimal risk-sharing rule.
Optimal risk-sharing between two parties was first analyzed by Borch (1962), in the
context of a reinsurance problem. He considers an optimal contract to share risk between
an insurance and a reinsurance company (or between two insurance companies). While
his framework is more general in many respects than the one we have just described,
he only derives a necessary condition for optimal co-insurance between two risk-averse
investors, the well known Borch condition.
In this paper we push the analysis further and derive explicit risk-sharing formulae that
approximate the optimal risk-sharing rule. We do this by reformulating the risk-sharing
problem as a recursive problem in which the Proposer oﬀers the Responder spot contracts,
each of which has three components: (i) a fixed transfer f to the Responder; (ii) a share s
of spot investment returns; and (iii) a final transfer b to be paid to the Responder in the
event that the venture terminates. We then derive relatively simple formulae for s and
b that approximate the optimal risk-sharing spot contract. Thus, a central contribution
of this paper is to derive (approximate) formulae for optimal risk-sharing for the CRRA
case.
As each investor’s aversion to risk and capacity to insure the other investor varies with

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

its wealth, the optimal shares s and b vary with the underlying wealth distribution. Thus,
one advantage of our recursive formulation is that it brings out explicitly the underlying
dynamics of the risk-sharing problem. These dynamics can be understood as follows.
Whenever the two investors engage in risk-sharing, the optimal spot contract will specify
a division of total investment returns that is diﬀerent from each investor’s share in total
wealth. As a result, the wealth distribution in the next period will be diﬀerent from the
wealth distribution in this period. For example, if the Responder insures the Proposer, by
taking on a share of risk bigger than his share in wealth, then his wealth share will increase
when there is a high investment return and decrease when there is a low investment return.
Either way, the wealth distribution changes and consequently each investor’s attitude
towards risk and capacity to insure changes. This change in each investor’s capacity to
insure introduces endogenous counterparty risk, and forward-looking investors will take
this risk into account in deciding on the optimal spot contract.1
To gain insight into how this counterparty risk can aﬀect optimal risk-sharing, consider
the extreme case in which the Responder is risk-neutral and the Proposer is risk-averse.
It is well known that optimal risk-sharing in a one-shot insurance contracting problem in
this case requires that the Responder insure the Proposer perfectly. But if the Responder
were to do this repeatedly, then he would be sure to go bankrupt at some point, and
then the Proposer would no longer be able to get any insurance at all. Foreseeing this,
the Proposer would want to hold back from getting perfect insurance. Only when the
Responder is relatively wealthy would the Proposer seek perfect insurance. When the
Responder is relatively poor, the Proposer may optimally limit the amount of insurance
she gets to preserve future insurance opportunities.
We are able to extend this insight to the general case, in which both investors are risk
averse, by assuming that both the Proposer and the Responder are close to myopic, and
by taking approximations around the myopic optimum. This approximation therefore
takes the form of a myopic benchmark plus a dynamic correction.
Consider first the optimal rule for the sharing of investment risk, namely s. The
myopic benchmark for s requires that the Responder take on a share in total investment
risk equal to the well known ratio of the Proposer’s coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion
1

The role played by counterparty risk in our model is analogous to the role that it plays in futures
markets. There, traders are required to maintain margin accounts as a way of eliminating default.
Although these requirements prevent any default as such, they bear witness to the profound role played
by counterparty risk, and they constrain the amount of hedging a counterparty can oﬀer.

to the sum of both investors’ coeﬃcients of absolute risk aversion. As for the dynamic
correction, if we denote by R and r the coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion of the Proposer
and Responder respectively, then:
1. When both investors are fairly risk tolerant, in the sense that R, r < 2, it is optimal for the less risk-averse investor to take on less risk in the dynamic-contracting
problem than the myopic rule would specify. This is because the less risk averse
investor is willing to take on risk on relatively unfavourable terms, so transferring
more risk to that investor tends to reduce the stock of insurance available to the
more risk averse investor in the future.
2. When both investors are fairly risk averse, in the sense that R, r > 2, it is optimal
for the less risk-averse investor to take on more risk in the dynamic-contracting
problem than the myopic rule would specify. This is because the less risk averse
investor is only willing to take on risk on relatively favourable terms, so transferring
more risk to that investor tends to increase the stock of insurance available to the
more risk averse investor in the future.
3. When one investor (say the Responder) is fairly risk tolerant but the other investor
(say the Proposer) is fairly risk averse, in other words when R > 2 > r, then the
Proposer takes on less risk when she is relatively poor and more risk when she is
relatively wealthy. This is because, when she is poor, her aversion to bearing risk
outweighs her concern that the Responder may run out of money; but when she is
rich, the opposite is true.
Consider next the optimal termination payment b. The myopic benchmark for b is
zero. This is because there is no termination risk in the myopic limit. As for the dynamic
correction, we show that: (i) if the venture has a high return then, following termination,
the less risk averse investor compensates the more risk averse investor for the loss of a
valuable investment opportunity; and (ii) if the venture has a low return then, prior to
termination, the less risk averse investor compensates the more risk averse investor for
the low returns obtained.
Although our model is highly stylized, it may be relevant to a number of applications.
We have already mentioned reinsurance as one application. Insurance companies are obviously capital constrained and they rely on each other to share common risk. Our analysis

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

sheds light on how these companies should structure their risk sharing to take account of
counterparty risk. Another application, which was our initial motivation, is to portfolioor fund-management contracts. In practice, the contract between a representative client
and a fund manager often takes the simple form of a share of portfolio returns for the
client equal to the client’s share of investments in the fund minus a management fee,
which is equal to a small percentage of the funds under management. We recognize that
the main concern in portfolio management generally is the manager’s incentive to run
the fund in the client’s best interest. Still, we believe that our analysis may be relevant
if there are also dynamic risk-sharing considerations involved in the long-term relation
between the client and the manager.2
Besides Borch (1962) and the large literature on optimal risk sharing that it has
spawned (see Eeckhoudt, Gollier and Schlesinger, 2005) our paper is most closely related
to the dynamic asset pricing problem with two classes of investors considered by Dumas
(1989). He analyzes the equilibrium investment and consumption choices of two classes
of investor with diﬀerent coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion in an otherwise standard
competitive economy with aggregate shocks. Although Dumas mainly focuses on equilibrium asset pricing, his analysis proceeds via a planning problem. One key diﬀerence
between his setup and ours is that he allows for ongoing consumption, while we only have
consumption upon termination. Another is that we have termination risk, while he only
considers an infinitely lived economy. Finally, Dumas’ solution method only works in the
case in which one investor has a log utility function.
There is by now accumulating evidence that consumers diﬀer substantially in their risk
preferences. Indeed, Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997), in their experimental
study on risk-taking decisions, found that the behaviour of 5% of subjects was consistent
with a coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion of 33 or higher, that the behaviour of another 5%
was consistent with a coeﬃcient of 1.3 or lower, and that the median coeﬃcient was about
7. Similarly, Guiso and Paiella (2008) and Chiappori and Paiella (2008) among others
find evidence of heterogeneous risk preferences in households’ actual portfolio allocations.
In addition, using panel data on individual portfolio allocations between risky and riskless
assets, Chiappori and Paiella (2008) are able to determine that the elasticity of the riskyasset share with respect to wealth in their sample is small and statistically insignificant,
which is consistent with CRRA risk preferences. In another panel study on household

portfolio choices, however, Paravisini, Rappoport and Ravina (2009) use investor fixed
eﬀects and find that the within-household elasticity of risk taking with respect to changes
in household wealth is negative and quite large. They also find substantial heterogeneity
in relative risk aversion in their sample, with an average coeﬃcient of 2.85 and a median
coeﬃcient of 1.62.
The present paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the two investors’ preferences and the investment technology. Section 3 derives the value function of the Responder
under autarky. Section 4 formulates the long-run contracting problem between the Proposer and Responder. Section 5 formulates the spot-contracting problem, and Section 6
derives the associated Bellman equation of the Proposer. Section 7 establishes that any
long-run contract for which the participation constraint of the Responder binds can be
replicated by a flow of spot contracts for which the spot participation constraint of the
Responder likewise binds. Section 8 shows that the Bellman equation of the Proposer under spot contracting can be reduced to a partial diﬀerential equation. Section 9 provides
a first characterization of the optimal risk-sharing rule and termination payment in terms
of the value functions of the Proposer and Responder. Section 10 uses asymptotic expansions to derive risk-sharing formulae which approximate the optimal risk-sharing rule
and termination payment. Section 11 shows how the Bellman equation for the Proposer
can be further reduced to a pair of ordinary diﬀerential equations on (0, 1). Section 12
identifies suﬃcient conditions under which a solution to these equations extends continuously to [0, 1]. Section 13 then solves the resulting two-point boundary-value problem
numerically. The numerical solutions show how well the formulae derived in Section 10
predict the qualitative shape of the optimal risk-sharing rule and termination payment,
suggesting that these formulae contain most of the analytical insight into optimal risk
sharing that can be obtained for our model. Section 14 oﬀers some concluding comments.

Preferences and Technology

The initial wealths of the Proposer and the Responder are W0 , w0 > 0. There is an
exogenous termination time T , which is distributed exponentially with parameter β > 0.
At any time t ∈ [0, T ] the parties have access to the same constant-stochastic-returnsto-scale investment opportunity, but they cannot consume. For an investment x, this
investment opportunity yields flow returns
dx = x (μ dt + σ dz),

where μ ∈ R, σ > 0 and z is a standard Wiener process (i.e. the shock dz at time t is
normally distributed with mean 0 and variance dt and is independent of the shocks at all
earlier times). Following termination, both parties consume their accumulated wealths
WT + and wT + .3
The risk preferences of the Proposer and the Responder are represented by the strictly
increasing and strictly concave utility functions U and u. In what follows it will sometimes
be helpful to avoid imposing specific functional forms on U and u, but we shall frequently

where we have suppressed the dependence of v on w.
If r is constant, then equation (2) has an explicit solution. Indeed, given that wealth
follows a geometric Wiener process and that utility is CRRA, it is natural to conjecture
that v will take the form
v(w) = Cr (ρr w),
where ρr is the certainty-equivalent rate of return of the Responder under autarky. This
conjecture is correct, and leads to the following Proposition:
Proposition 2. Suppose that the Responder has constant relative risk aversion. Then
equation (2) has a solution of the form
v(w) = Cr (w) + w Cr0 (w) ψr ,
4

More precisely, the random function χ : [0, ∞) → {0, 1} is given by the formula χt = 0 if t ≤ T and
χt = 1 if t > T . In particular, in a reversal of the usual convention, χ is continuous on the left.

where γ r =

In particular, under autarky, the normalized value function of the Responder ψr is
simply the risk-adjusted rate of return μ − 12 r σ 2 divided by the eﬀective discount rate β r .
Proof. Suppose that v(w) = Cr (ρr w), and put ψr = Cr (ρr ). Then
v(w) = Cr (ρr w) = Cr (w) + w Cr0 (w) Cr (ρr ) = Cr (w) + w Cr0 (w) ψr ,
u(w) − v(w) = Cr (w) − (Cr (w) + w Cr0 (w) ψr ) = −w Cr0 (w) ψr ,

Since the marginal value of wealth and the normalized marginal value of wealth must
be positive, we see in particular that a basic requirement for our contracting problem to
make sense is that β r > 0, i.e. that:
Condition I. β > (1 − r) (μ − 12 r σ 2 ).
In other words, the rate of discounting β must exceed the rate of growth of utility
when wealth grows at the risk-adjusted rate of return μ − 12 r σ 2 .

Remark 3. When r < 1, the utility function of the Responder is unbounded above. The
main point of Condition I is then to ensure that the wealth of the Responder cannot grow
too fast. When r > 1, the utility function of the Responder is unbounded below, and the
main point of Condition I is to ensure that the wealth of the Responder cannot shrink
too fast.
It is also natural to assume that the analogue of Condition I for the Proposer holds,
namely:
Condition II. β > (1 − R) (μ − 12 R σ 2 ).
4.

The Long-Run-Contracting Problem

Suppose that the Proposer oﬀers the Responder a long-run contract q, according to which
the two parties will pool their wealths until termination, after which the wealth pool will
be shared between them. More precisely: let Ω denote the set of pairs (X, T ) such that
X : [0, ∞) → (0, ∞) is continuous on the left,5 T ∈ [0, ∞) and X is constant on (T, ∞);6
and let q : Ω → R be a bounded measurable function such that 0 < q(X, T ) < XT + for
all (X, T ) ∈ Ω.7 If the Responder accepts q then: the initial wealth pool will be
X0 = W0 + w0 ;
5

(3)

We assume that the timepaths of all of our variables are continuous on the left. This is a departure
from the usual convention, which is to take the timepaths of variables to be continuous on the right.
We do this because, in order to write our various Bellman equations in a compact way, it is helpful to
have W , w and χ, which are short for Wt , wt and χt , denote the values of the Proposer’s wealth, the
Responder’s wealth and the termination indicator at the beginning of period t; and to have W + dW ,
w + dw and χ + dχ denote the values of these variables at the end of period t.
6
In view of our convention that the timepaths of variables are continuous on the left, the timepath of
a variable over the stochastic interval [0, T ] tells us the value of the variable at the beginning of every
period t ∈ [0, T ] and – by taking limits on the right – the value of the variable at the end of every period
t ∈ [0, T ). In particular, it tells us the initial value of the variable, i.e. the value at the beginning of
period 0, but not the final value of the variable, i.e. the value at the end of period T . (If we adopted the
usual convention, namely that the timepaths of variables are continuous on the right, then the timepath
of a variable over the stochastic interval [0, T ] would tell us the final value of the variable at the end
of period T but not the initial value of the variable at the beginning of time 0.) We therefore need to
supply the final value. We do this by requiring that the variable be defined but constant on (T, ∞), and
by interpreting the value there as the final value. This convention has the advantage that the value at
the end of period T can – like the values at the end of any other period t ∈ [0, T ) – be found by taking
the limit on the right.
7
Notice that the information conveyed by the pair (X, T ) consists of: T , which is the termination
time; the restriction of X to the interval [0, T ], which tells us the value Xt of X at the beginning of each
period t ∈ [0, T ] and the value Xt+ of X at the end of each period t ∈ [0, T ); and the value of X on
the interval (T, ∞), which tells us the value XT + of X at the end of each period T . The final payment
q(X, T ) can depend on all this information.

the wealth pool will evolve according to the equation
dX =

(

X (μ dt + σ dz)

if t ∈ [0, T ]

)

;

(4)

and the final wealths of the Proposer and the Responder will be
WT + = XT + − q(X, T ) and wT + = q(X, T ).

(5)

If the Responder rejects q then both parties will operate under autarky until termination.8
In the long-run contracting problem, the Proposer’s problem is therefore to choose q
to maximize her expected utility
(6)
E[U(WT + )]
subject to the dynamics (3-5) and the participation constraint of the Responder, namely
E[u(wT + )] ≥ v(w0 ),

(7)

where v is the value function of the Responder under autarky.
Three points should be noted. First, taken together, Conditions I and II ensure that
the expected payoﬀs of both parties are well defined in the event of disagreement. Second,
the Proposer can always do at least as well in the long-run contracting problem as she
can under autarky. This is because she can reproduce the autarky outcome by oﬀering
the contract
w0
XT + .
q(X, T ) =
W0 + w0
Third, the participation constraint of the Responder always binds in the long-run contracting problem. For, if it did not, then the Proposer could just scale down q until the
participation constraint of the Responder did bind. This would have the eﬀect of transferring a strictly positive — albeit stochastic — amount of the final total wealth from the
Responder to the Proposer, and would therefore make the Proposer strictly better oﬀ.
The main challenge in establishing the existence of an optimal contract is therefore
to show that the expected payoﬀ of the Proposer is bounded above. One of the many
advantages of the spot-contracting problem introduced below is that it allows us to find
8

Since X is continuous, total wealth XT + at the end of period T is equal to total wealth XT at the
beginning of period T . We write XT + in the interests of notational consistency.

12

transparent suﬃcient conditions under which this is the case.
5.

The Spot-Contracting Problem

The easiest way to solve the long-run contracting problem is to show that it can be reduced
to a spot contracting problem. In a spot contracting problem, the two parties start out
with their initial wealths W0 and w0 . Then, in each period t ∈ [0, T ], the Proposer oﬀers
the Responder a spot contract
¢
¡
(f, s, b) ∈ R × R× − Ww+w , WW+w .

If the Responder accepts then he receives:

1. a non-contingent transfer (W + w) f dt, which is an up-front payment for his participation in the risk-sharing arrangement;
2. a contingent transfer (W + w) s (μ dt + σ dz), which is his share in the total returns
on investment; and
3. a contingent transfer (W + w) b dχ, which is an insurance payment in the event that
he loses the investment opportunity as a result of termination.
More explicitly, if the Responder accepts, then the changes in the wealths of the Proposer
and the Responder are
dW = (W + w) (−f dt + (1 − s) (μ dt + σ dz) − b dχ) ,
dw = (W + w) (f dt + s (μ dt + σ dz) + b dχ) .

(8)
(9)

If the Responder rejects the spot contract, then both parties invest under autarky for the
current period, and the changes in the wealths of the Proposer and the Responder are
dW = W (μ dt + σ dz),

(10)

dw = w (μ dt + σ dz).

(11)

In each period t ∈ (T, ∞), dW = dw = 0. Finally, at the end of period T , both parties
consume their accumulated stock of wealth to obtain utilities U (WT + ) and u(wT + ).

The Bellman Equation of the Proposer

In this section, we consider the case of the spot contracting problem in which the value
function of the Responder is his value function under autarky, namely ve, and the spot
contract oﬀered by the Proposer is always accepted. As will become clear in the next
section, this is the only case that we shall need. In this case, the Bellman equation of the
Proposer can be derived as follows. Suppose that χ = 0 and, for any given spot contract
(f, s, b), put
dW S = (W + w) (−f dt + (1 − s) (μ dt + σ dz) − b dχ) ,
dwS = (W + w) (f dt + s (μ dt + σ dz) + b dχ) ,

dW A = W (μ dt + σ dz),
dwA = w (μ dt + σ dz).
In other words, let dW S and dwS be the changes in the wealth of the Proposer and the
Responder if (f, s, b) is accepted; and let dW A and dwA be the changes in the wealth of
the Proposer and the Responder if (f, s, b) is rejected.
Further, let A(w) denote the set of (f, s, b) such that:
1. the participation constraint of the Responder, namely

is satisfied; and

2. the Bellman equation of the Responder, namely

is satisfied.

(13)

Then the Bellman equation of the Proposer is the equation

Here inequality (12) says that the Responder weakly prefers to accept (f, s, b) rather
than proceed under autarky when his continuation utility is given by ve; equation (13)
says that ve(w, 0) is the expected utility to the Responder from accepting (f, s, b) when his
continuation utility is given by ve; and equation (14) says that if χ = 0 then Ve (W, w, χ)
is the expected utility to the Proposer from choosing the best feasible (f, s, b) when her
continuation utility is given by Ve , and that if χ = 1 then Ve (W, w, χ) is simply U(W ).
Notice that the Proposer can always ensure that the participation constraint of the
Responder is satisfied by choosing f = 0, s = Ww+w and b = 0. In other words, the
Proposer can always reproduce the autarky outcome by a suitable choice of spot contract.
Notice too that the only reason why dW A does not feature explicitly in these equations
is that e
v does not depend on W . Notice finally that, in the special case with which we
are concerned (namely the case in which the value function of the Responder under spot
contracting is simply his value function under autarky), the participation constraint holds
as an equality:
Lemma 4. The following three statements are equivalent:
1. (f, s, b) ∈ A(w), i.e. both the participation constraint and the Bellman equation of
the Responder hold;
¤
£
¤
£
2. E ve(w + dwS , dχ) = E ve(w + dwA , dχ) , i.e. the participation constraint of the

¤

3. ve(w, 0) = E ve(w + dwS , dχ) , i.e. the Bellman equation of the Responder holds.

Proof. We show first that statement 3 implies statement 2. Indeed, since ve is the
value function of the Responder under autarky, we have
¤
£
v(w, 0) = E ve(w + dwA , dχ) .
e

(15)

Combining this with statement 3 leads immediately to statement 2. We show next that
statement 2 implies statement 1. Indeed, if statement 2 holds then, a fortiori, the participation constraint of the Responder must hold. On the other hand, combining statement
2 with equation (15) shows that the Bellman equation of the Responder is satisfied. That
statement 1 implies statement 3 is trivial.

Replicating a Long-Run Contract

In this section, we show that any long-run contract for which the participation constraint
of the Responder holds as an equality can be replicated by a flow of spot contracts for
which the participation constraint of the Responder again holds as an equality. More
precisely: recall that v = e
v(·, 0) is the value function of the Responder under autarky
prior to termination; suppose that we are given a long-run contract q : Ω → (0, ∞) such
that E[u(q(X, T ))] = v(w0 ); let Ft denote the information available up to the beginning
of period min{t, T };9,10 and put
mt = E [ u(q(X, T )) | Ft ] .
Then: m0 = v(w0 ) by choice of q; m is a martingale; and we may apply the martingale
representation theorem to show that there exist coeﬃcients η and θ such that
dm = η dz + θ (dχ − β dt).
Here: dz and dχ are the innovations to information at time t; η and θ depend only on
information available at the beginning of period t; and, by subtracting β dt from dχ, we
ensure that E [dm | Ft ] = 0. Moreover: m is continuous on [0, T ]; m may jump at T ; and
m is constant and equal to u(q(X, T )) on (T, ∞).
Next, define the certainty-equivalent wealth process c of the Responder by the formula
ct =

(

v −1 (mt )

if t ∈ [0, T ]

u−1 (mt ) if t ∈ (T, ∞)

)

.

In other words, let ct be the unique solution of the equation ve(ct , χt ) = mt . Then:
9

Up to now we have largely suppressed the time subscipt. However, the argument given at the end of
the section makes explicit use of two diﬀerent times, namely t and t + dt, and it is therefore helpful to
make the time subsscript explicit on the four variables that are involved in that argument, namely F, m,
c and χ.
10
The underlying stochastic drivers of our model are the standard Wiener process z and the exponentially distributed termination time T . If t > T , then the information available up to the beginning of
time t includes the timepath of z over the interval (T, t]. By conditioning only on information available
at the beginning of period min{t, T }, we exclude the use of this additional stochastic information.

where g = v−1 ; and c is constant and equal to q(X, T ) on (T, ∞).
Now, if we match the coeﬃcients of dt, dz and dχ in equation (9) for the dynamics
of the wealth of the Responder in the spot-contracting problem with the coeﬃcients of
dt, dz and dχ in equation (16) for the dynamics of the certainty-equivalent wealth of the
Responder in the long-run contracting problem, then we get
X (f + s μ) =

In other words, the Bellman equation of the Responder holds. By Lemma 4, this is equivalent to saying that the Participation constraint of the Responder holds as an equality.

The Reduced Bellman Equation

In the long-run contracting problem, the Proposer can always do better by choosing a
contract for which the participation constraint of the Responder holds as an equality.
Furthermore, any such contract can be replicated by a flow of spot contracts for which
the participation constraint of the Responder again holds as an equality. The Proposer
can therefore always do at least as well in the spot-contracting problem as in the long-run
contracting problem. It is therefore of considerable interest to solve the spot-contracting
problem.
In this section, we make a start by showing that the Bellman equation of the Proposer
under spot contracting, namely equation (14), can be reduced to a partial diﬀerential
equation, namely equation (23) below. To this end: put V = Ve (·, 0); denote the partial
derivatives of V by VW , Vw , VW W , VW w and Vww ; and let VP = VW −Vw , VW P = VW W −VW w
and VP P = VW W − 2 VW w + Vww . Then:

We shall refer to equation (23) as the reduced Bellman equation of the Proposer. The
maximand in this equation involves three main terms. The first term is
μ (W + w) VW .

(Term 1)

In order to bring out the analogy with the other terms in the equation, it is helpful to
separate this term into two parts. The first part is
(1 − s) μ (W + w) VW + s μ (W + w) Vw .

(Term 1a)

This is the direct benefit to the Proposer of the expected return on total wealth when it

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

18

is shared according to the sharing rule s. It consists of: the Proposer’s share 1 − s in the
expected return μ (W + w) times the shadow value VW to the Proposer of wealth in the
hands of the Proposer; plus the Responder’s share s in the expected return μ (W + w)
times the shadow value Vw to the Proposer of wealth in the hands of the Responder. The
second part is
(Term 1b)
s μ (W + w) VP
This is the indirect benefit to the Proposer of the expected return on total wealth when
it is shared according to the sharing rule s. In this part: s μ (W + w) is the Responder’s
share in the expected return μ (W + w); and VP is the shadow value to the Proposer of
transfers from the Responder to the Proposer. Notice that: the shadow value of transfers
VP = VW − Vw takes into account both the impact of a transfer on the Proposer’s own
wealth (as measured by VW ) and the impact of a transfer on the Responder’s wealth (as
measured by Vw ); and the impact of a transfer on the Responder’s wealth must be taken
into account since (by making the Responder poorer) a transfer may worsen the terms on
which the Proposer can get insurance from the Responder in the future.
The second term consists of two parts. The first part (with sign reversed) is
¡
¢
− 12 σ 2 (W + w)2 VW W − 2 s VW P + s2 VP P .

(Term 2a)

This is the direct cost to the Proposer of the investment shocks when they are shared
according to the sharing rule s. It can be written more explicitly as
¡
¢
− 12 σ 2 (W + w)2 (1 − s)2 VW W + 2 s (1 − s) VW w + s2 Vww .

Notice that the Proposer cares about shocks to her own wealth, about shocks to the
Responder’s wealth (since these aﬀect the terms on which she can obtain insurance) and
about the correlation between the shocks to her own wealth and those to the wealth of
the Responder. The second part of the second term (with sign reversed) is
− 12 σ 2 (W + w)2

VP 2 00
s v .
v0

(Term 2b)

This is the indirect cost to the Proposer of the shocks to W and w when they are shared
according to the sharing rule s. In this part: − 12 σ 2 (W + w)2 s2 v00 is the cost to the
Responder of the shocks; v 0 is the shadow value to the Responder of wealth in the hands

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

19

of the Responder; and VP is the shadow value to the Proposer of transfers from the
Responder to the Proposer. The cost to the Responder is initially measured in units of
the Responder’s utility. Dividing it by v0 converts it into money terms, at which point its
value to the Proposer can be found by multiplying by VP . The second part of the second
term can also be written

which emphasizes the role played by the absolute risk aversion of the Responder (namely
00
− vv0 ). Notice that the absolute risk aversion of the Responder is endogenous (it depends
on w).
The third term likewise consists of two parts. The first part (with sign reversed) is
β (V − U (W − (W + w) b)).

(Term 3a)

This is the direct cost to the Proposer of termination when it is insured using the payment
b. The second part of the third term (with sign reversed) is
VP
β (v − u(w + (W + w) b)).
v0

(Term 3b)

This is the indirect cost to the Proposer of termination when it is insured using the
payment b. In this part: β (v − u(w + (W + w) b)) is the cost to the Responder of the
possibility of termination; v0 is, as above, the shadow value to the Responder of wealth
in the hands of the Responder; and VP is, as before, the shadow value to the Proposer of
transfers from the Responder to the Proposer.
To summarize, under spot contracting, the Proposer takes into account the expected
return obtained by both parties, the costs to both parties of the shocks to wealth as
mitigated by the risk-sharing rule s and the costs to both parties of the termination risk
as mitigated by the risk-sharing rule b. The maximand of the Proposer involves three
terms: a term in μ; a term in σ 2 ; and a term in β. The term in μ does not involve either
of the control variables s or b; the term in σ 2 involves only s; and the term in β involves
only b. The problem of optimizing s is therefore separable from the problem of optimizing
b.
Proof. In view of Lemma 4, (f, s, b) ∈ A(w) iﬀ equation (13) holds. Putting v = ve(·, 0)

in that equation, we obtain

where

First-Order Conditions for s and b

In this section, we give a preliminary characterization of the optimal sharing rule s and
the optimal termination payment b in terms of the value functions V and v of the Proposer
and the Responder.

to compare it with the optimal static sharing rule

.

Compared with this rule, the optimal dynamic rule exhibits three complications. First,
the exogenous utility functions U and u are replaced with the endogenous value functions
V and v. Second, the risk aversion of the Proposer is evaluated not with respect to her
own wealth W , but instead with respect to the diﬀerence between her own wealth and that
in the
of the Responder, namely P = W − w.12 Third, there is an additional term − VVwP

numerator. This term captures the idea that current changes in the Responder’s wealth
have implications for the price at which the Proposer will be able to obtain insurance in
the future.13

v0

It can be shown quite generally that VP P + v 00 VvP0 ≥ 0, and our later analysis will confirm that this
inequality is strict when both parties have constant relative risk aversion.
12
The risk aversion of the Responder is still evaluated with respect to his own wealth since v does not
depend on W .

The analogous term for the Responder does not occur since v does not depend on W .

for this maximization is

Rearranging, we obtain the desired equation.
The optimality condition (26) is akin to the familiar Borch condition. The optimal
final transfer is set so that the ratio of the Proposer’s and the Responder’s marginal utility
of wealth in the event that termination occurs is equal to the ratio of the Proposer’s and
the Responder’s marginal value of transfers (in the event that termination does not occur).
The close analogy between this optimality condition and the Borch condition suggests that
VP and v0 can be interpreted as the welfare weights of the Proposer and the Responder
in a welfare maximization problem.
10.

Asymptotic Expansions

A first approach to understanding optimal risk sharing is to consider what happens when
β is large, i.e. when the future is heavily discounted. More precisely, we look for approximations to V , v, s and b in the form V (0) + β1 V (1) , v(0) + β1 v(1) , s(0) + β1 s(1) and
b(0) + β1 b(1) . A striking feature of these approximations is that they give a qualitatively
accurate picture of the behaviour of V , v, s and b even when β takes on much more
moderate values, as is demonstated by our numerical simulations in Section 13 below.
10.1. Myopic Terms. We begin by indentifying the myopic components of V , v, s
and b, namely V (0) , v(0) , s(0) and b(0) .
Proposition 8. V (0) = U, v (0) = u, s(0) =

−

U 00
U0

U 00 u00
− 0− 0
U
u

and b(0) = 0.

These expressions can be explained as follows. First, at order 0, the relationship ends
immediately. The myopic value functions V (0) and v(0) are therefore simply the respective
utilities U and u of consuming current wealth. Second, the myopic sharing rule s(0) is
the familiar ratio of the Proposer’s coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion to the sum of the
two parties coeﬃcients of absolute risk aversion. Third, the myopic termination payment
b(0) is zero because, when β is very large, termination is essentially certain and it is not
therefore possible to insure against it.

10.2. Dynamic Terms: V (1) and v (1) . In this section we determine the dynamic

where we have suppressed the dependence of R and r on W and w respectively.
In other words, the dynamic correction V (1) is composed of three elements: the riskadjusted rate of return on the Proposer’s wealth, namely
(μ − 12 R σ 2 ) W ;
the monetary value of the gains from sharing investment risk, namely

and the marginal utility of wealth U 0 (W ). The first two elements are measured in units
of wealth. Multiplying them by U 0 (W ) converts them into units of the Proposer’s utility. Similarly, v (1) is composed of two elements: the risk-adjusted rate of return on the
Responder’s wealth, namely
(μ − 12 r σ 2 ) w;
and the marginal utility of wealth u0 (w).

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

Notice that there is no contribution to V (1) reflecting the monetary value of the gains
from sharing termination risk. Such a contribution would be expected to arise at order
2. However, exploring higher-order terms in the expansions is beyond the scope of this
paper.14 Also, in accordance with the bargaining positions of the two parties, the Responder does not receive any share in the gains from sharing investment risk. Finally, these
formulae do not depend on the assumption that U and u are CRRA. (The formulae for
s(1) and b(1) below do.)
Proof. Equating terms of order 1 in equation (27), we obtain

0 = 12 σ 2 w2 vww
+ μ w vw(0) − v(1) .

Hence, using the fact that v (0) = u and rearranging, we obtain

10.3. Dynamic Terms: s(1) . In this section we determine the dynamic correction
s(1) to the myopic sharing rule s(0) . This correction is of interest for two reasons. First, it
allows us to make qualitative predictions as to how the optimal risk-sharing rule s diﬀers
from the myopic sharing rule s(0) . These predictions can then be compared with numerical
simulations. Second, it oﬀers some insight into why s diﬀers from s(0) in the way that it
does.

((1 − y) R + y r)

is the Proposer’s share in aggregate wealth.

The main lessons that can be extracted from the formula for s(0) are as follows. First,
the myopic sharing rule s(0) is – modulo normalization by multiplying the numerator and
R
,
the denominator by W +w – the ratio of the Proposer’s absolute risk aversion, namely W
R
+ wr .
to the sum of the Proposer’s and the Responder’s absolute risk aversions, namely W
It is strictly decreasing in the Proposer’s wealth share y. When y = 0, the Proposer is
eﬀectively infinitely risk averse, and s(0) = 1. When y = 1, the Responder is eﬀectively
infinitely risk averse, and s(0) = 0.
Second, notice that s(0) is the proportion of the investment risk on total wealth that
the Responder bears. The proportion of the investment risk on his own wealth that he
bears is therefore
W + w (0)
R
s =
,
w

29

and his leverage is
R
y (R − r)
−1=
.
(1 − y) R + y r
(1 − y) R + y r
If R > r then his leverage is 0 when y = 0, and rises to R−r
> 0 when y = 1. In particular,
r
his leverage is greater when his wealth is smaller. His leverage is 0 when y = 0 because
in that case he has all the wealth, and so risk sharing with the Proposer has a negligible
impact. It is increasing in y because – from his point of view – the opportunities for
risk sharing are increasing in y and, as the less risk averse party, taking advantage of these
opportunites means increasing his leverage. If R < r, then his leverage is 0 when y = 0
< 0 when y = 1. In particular, his leverage is smaller when his wealth is
and falls to R−r
r
smaller.
Third, if R = r, then s(0) = 1 − y and s(1) = 0. In other words, each party bears
precisely the risk on their own wealth, and their wealth shares therefore remain unchanged.
Turning to the formula for the dynamic correction s(1) , we begin with a definition:
Definition 11. The Proposer is fairly risk tolerant if R < 2 and fairly risk averse if
R > 2. Similarly, the Responder is fairly risk tolerant if r < 2 and fairly risk averse if
r > 2.
We go on to note that s(1) is the product of three terms, namely
1
2

R r σ 2 y 2 (1 − y)2
,
((1 − y) R + y r)5

(R − r)3 ,

(1 − y) R + y r − 2.

The first of these is always positive; the second has the same sign as R − r; and the third
is aﬃne in y. Hence, if we assume for concreteness that R > r, then we have three cases
to consider:
The Risk-Tolerant Case When both parties are fairly risk tolerant, i.e. 2 > R > r,
then (1 − y) R + y r − 2 < 0 for all y ∈ [0, 1]. Hence s(1) < 0 for all y ∈ (0, 1).
This suggests that s − s(0) < 0 for all y ∈ (0, 1), where s is the optimal risk-sharing
rule. In other words, irrespective of the distribution of wealth, it is optimal for the
Proposer to transfer less risk to the Responder than she would under the myopic
risk-sharing rule. The risk-tolerant case is illustrated in Figure 1(a).
The Risk-Averse Case When both parties are fairly risk averse, i.e. R > r > 2, then
(1−y) R+y r−2 > 0 for all y ∈ [0, 1]. Hence s(1) > 0 for all y ∈ (0, 1). This suggests

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

30

that s − s(0) > 0 for all y ∈ (0, 1). In other words, irrespective of the distribution of
wealth, it is optimal for the Proposer to transfer more risk to the Responder than
she would under the myopic risk-sharing rule. The risk-averse case is illustrated in
Figure 1(b).
The Mixed Case When the Proposer is fairly risk averse and the Responder is fairly

share in total wealth, it is optimal for her to transfer more risk to the Responder
than she would under the myopic risk sharing rule; and, when she has a large share
in total wealth, it is optimal for her to transfer less risk to him than she would
under the myopic risk sharing rule. The mixed case is illustrated in Figure 1(c).
Figure 1 about here
The qualitative accuracy of these predictions can be demonstrated by plotting s − s(0) ,
where s is the (numerically computed) optimal contract.15 This is done in Figure 2.
Figure 2(a) shows s − s(0) in the risk-tolerant case. This figure is very similar to Figure
1(a). The main diﬀerence is quantitative: the minimum in Figure 2(a) is somewhat lower
than that in Figure 1(a). Figure 2(b) shows s − s(0) in the risk-averse case. This figure is
very similar to Figure 1(b). The main diﬀerence is again quantitative: the maximum in
Figure 2(b) is somewhat lower than that in Figure 1(b). Finally, Figure 2(c) shows s−s(0)
in the mixed case. This figure is similar to Figure 1(c) in that the graph first rises to a
positive maximum and then falls to a negative minimum. However, the balance between
the left-hand hump and the right-hand hump is slightly diﬀerent.
Figure 2 about here
The predictions are best understood in terms of counterparty risk. Indeed, consider
the risk-tolerant case. Since r < 2, the Responder is willing to take on risk on relatively
unfavourable terms, and the Proposer must bear in mind the possibility that he will
eventually run out of wealth. This leads her to take on somewhat more risk than she
15

would under the myopic benchmark, thereby delaying the time at which the Responder
runs out of wealth. In eﬀect, insurance is a scarce resource, and she chooses to husband it.
Now consider the mixed case. The Responder is still willing to take on risk on relatively
unfavourable terms, and the Proposer must still bear in mind the possibility that he
will eventually run out of wealth. However, in this case the Proposer is only willing to
.
take on the extra risk when she has a fairly large wealth share, i.e. when y > R−2
R−r
R−2
When y < R−r , the cost of bearing additional risk outweighs the benefit of husbanding
insurance, and she transfers more risk to the Responder than she would under the myopic
benchmark. Loosely speaking, the stock of insurance is measured by 1 − y, and should be
and conserved when y > R−2
. Finally, consider the risk-averse
exploited when y < R−2
R−r
R−r
case. Since r > 2, the Responder is only willing to take on risk on relatively favourable
terms. Transferring more risk to him therefore has the indirect eﬀect of increasing the rate
of growth of his wealth and therefore the stock of insurance. The Proposer therefore does
not hesitate to transfer more risk to him than she would under the myopic benchmark.

10.4. Dynamic Terms: b(1) . In this section we determine the dynamic correction b(1)
to the myopic termination payment b(0) . Since b(0) = 0, this correction leads directly to
qualitative predictions about the optimal termination payment b. The principal prediction
is that the sign of b will depend on whether the investment opportunity is good or bad,
in the sense that the ratio 2σμ2 is high or low relative to the other parameters of the model.
For example, suppose that R > r. In this case, if the value of the investment opportunity
is high, then we should have b < 0. In other words, the Responder should compensate the
Proposer for the loss of the valuable investment opportunity when termination occurs.
On the other hand, if the value of the investment opportunity is low, then we should
have b > 0. In other words, the Responder should compensate the Proposer for the losses
that she faces while the investment is ongoing, and receives in return a payment from the
Proposer when the good state (namely termination) is reached.
There is, however, an important twist to the story: for intermediate values of the ratio
2μ
, the sign of b should depend on the Proposer’s wealth share y. In the risk-tolerant case,
σ2
we predict that b will be positive for small y and negative for large y. In the risk-averse
case, we predict that b will be negative for small y and positive for large y. In the mixed
case, the picture is more involved. However, the most interesting possibility is that in

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

33

which b will be negative for y near 0 or 1 but positive for intermediate values of y.
Proposition 12. Suppose that both U and u are CRRA. Then
b(0) = 0
and
b(1) =

Now, b(1) is the product of three terms, namely
y (1 − y)

(1 − y) R + y r

2

σ 2 B(y) − μ.

The first of these is always positive; the second has the same sign as R − r; and the third
is linear in the core parameters μ and σ 2 , but depends in an apparently complicated way
on y. Fortunately, this complexity is more apparent than real: if we diﬀerentiate B with
respect to y, then we obtain a formula that is highly reminiscent of the formula for s(1) ,
namely
R r (R − r)
B 0 (y) =
((1 − y) R + y r − 2).
((1 − y) R + y r)3
Assuming for concreteness that R > r, we therefore arrive at the three same cases that
we encountered in the context of our discussion of s(1) , namely:
The Risk-Tolerant Case If 2 > R > r, then we have B 0 < 0 for all y ∈ [0, 1]. There
are therefore three subcases to consider, namely
2μ
σ2

< B(1),

2μ
σ2

2μ
σ2

> B(0).

In the first subcase, b(1) > 0 for all y ∈ (0, 1); in the second, there exists y ∈ (0, 1)
such that b(1) > 0 for y ∈ (0, y) and b(1) < 0 for y ∈ (y, 1); in the third, b(1) < 0 for
all y ∈ (0, 1). This case is illustrated in Figure 3(a).

such that b(1) < 0 for y ∈ (0, y) and b(1) > 0 for y ∈ (y, 1); in the third, b(1) < 0 for
all y ∈ (0, 1). This case is illustrated in Figure 3(b).

This case is illustrated in Figure 3(c).16

Since b(0) = 0, these observations concerning b(1) translate directly into predictions
about the optimal termination payment b. These predictions are remarkable at three
levels. First, they are qualitatively correct: every case and subcase described above
occurs. Second, they are quantitatively correct in the sense that they even predict the
parameter values for which the various cases will occur. For example, if we are looking for
the third subcase of the mixed case, which involves b(1) < 0 near the ends of the interval
(0, 1) but b(1) > 0 in the middle, then we should choose

The second subcase of the mixed case divides into two subsubcases depending on whether B(0) < B(1)
or B(0) > B(1). In this connection, it is worth noting that B(0) < B(1) iﬀ the harmonic mean of R
and r exceeds 2. This is another instance where the outcome depends on whether mean risk aversion lies
above or below 2.

In other words, when termination occurs: the Responder pays the Proposer a fraction
s(0) of the total loss I + G to the Proposer from termination; and the Proposer pays
the Responder a fraction 1 − s(0) of the total loss i to the Responder from termination.
These payments are, however, oﬀset by terms reflecting the opportunity cost of buying
the termination insurance ex ante. Finally, substituting for I, i and G and collecting

The three parameters β, μ and σ2 are not independent of one another: one of them can be scaled
out of the problem. For the present purposes, it is convenient to scale out σ2 . In this way we arrive at
2
the dimensionless parameter ε = σβ . Our asymptotic expansions are premised on the assumption that
this parameter is small. In all of the three baseline parameter constellations used in Section 13 below,
we have σ 2 = 0.0225 and therefore ε = 0.45. This is still less than 1, and cannot therefore be considered
to be exceptionally large.

The One-dimensional Bellman Equation

Asymptotic expansions in β1 have yielded approximations for the optimal risk-sharing rule
and the optimal termination payment when β is large. Do these approximations tell us
most of what we want to know about the general case, or do new phenomena arise when β
is not necessarily large? To answer this question, we need to compute numerical solutions
for the Bellman equation and the optimal contract, and to compare these solutions with
the approximations. In this section we undertake some of the preparatory analytical work
that is needed before we can turn to the numerical simulations themselves. This involves
two main steps: (i) we reduce the Bellman equation from a partial diﬀerential equation in
(W, w)-space to a pair of ordinary diﬀerential equations in y-space; (ii) we normalize the
value function with respect to the wealth share of both the Proposer and the Responder.
In the process, we arrive at some new analytical insights. For example, we obtain a proof
of the intuitively reasonable result that the Responder takes on more that his share in
the total investment risk when r < R, and less than his share when r > R.18 Or again,
we obtain a much more concrete formula for s.19 Nonetheless, the reader who is anxious
to see the numerical results – and how they compare with the approximations – may
wish to skip the remainder of this section, review Conditions III and IV in Section 12,
and then proceed to Section 13.
11.1. Some Normalizations. Since both the Proposer and the Responder have CRRA
utility, and since the returns to their investment follow a geometric Brownian motion, it
is natural to look for a solution to the reduced Bellman equation of the Proposer in the
form
V (W, w) = CR (ρ(y) W ),
where ρ is the Proposer’s certainty-equivalent rate of return and y = WW+w is the Proposer’s
share in total wealth. However, as in the Responder’s problem under autarky, we have
CR (ρ(y) W ) = CR (W ) + W CR0 (W ) CR (ρ(y)),
18

See Corollary 17 below.
Compare equation (25) above, which gives the formula for the general case in which U and u are
not necessarily CRRA, with equation (39) below, which gives the formula obtained in the special case in
which U and u are CRRA.
19

37

and it turns out to be more convenient to work in terms of
ψ(y) = CR (ρ(y)),
which we call the normalized value function of the Proposer. It is also useful to note that
VP (W, w) = γ(y) CR0 (W ),
where
γ(y) = 1 + (1 − R) ψ(y) + y ψ0 (y)
is what we call the normalized marginal value of transfers of the Proposer.
We take the following proposition to be economically obvious:
Proposition 13. γ > 0. ¥
Next, we shall need an appropriate normalization of ψ. To this end, we consider
the Proposer’s problem under autarky. By analogy with the Responder’s problem under
autarky, we see at once that the Proposer’s value function under autarky takes the form
CR (W ) + W CR0 (W ) ψR , where
μ − 12 R σ 2
ψR =
βR
and
β R = β − (1 − R) (μ − 12 R σ 2 ).
Moreover her marginal value of wealth under autarky takes the form γ R CR0 (W ), where
γR =

β
.
βR

The required normalization of ψ is then
χ(y) =

ψ(y) − ψR
.
(1 − y) γ R

The motivation for looking at the diﬀerence ψ(y) − ψR should be clear: we want to see
what the Proposer gains by sharing risk with the Responder. The motivation for dividing
through by 1 − y is that the gain from trade is necessarily small when y is near 0 or 1,
and we would like to measure the gain from trade relative to the wealth of the poorer

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

38

of the two parties. Now, the initial normalization that we made in moving from V to ψ
took care of the possibility that the Proposer might have little wealth. So it remains only
to take care of the possibility that the Responder might have little wealth. This explains
the presence of the factor 1 − y in the denominator. The factor γ R serves to simplify the
algebra which follows.
It is also convenient to introduce analogous normalizations for the contracting variables
s and b, namely
b
s − (1 − y)
and g =
.
z=
y (1 − y)
y (1 − y)
From an economic perspective, z is simply the ratio of the Responder’s leverage to the
Principal’s share in total wealth. Indeed, the total investment risk borne by the Responder
is s (W + w), and his leverage is therefore
s − (1 − y)
s (W + w) − w
=
.
w
1−y
From a mathematical perspective, notice that the Responder takes on a share in the total
investment risk diﬀerent from his autarky share, namely 1 − y. This diﬀerence will be
small when y is near 0, since then the Responder has to bear almost all the risk (because
he owns almost all the wealth). It will also be small when y is near 1, since then the
Responder bears almost none of the risk (because he owns almost none of the wealth).
Dividing through by y (1 − y) therefore normalizes the departure of the Responder’s share
under bilateral contracting from his share under autarky. Similarly, the proportion b of
total wealth transferred between the two parties in the event of termination is small when
y is near 0 or 1. It is therefore helpful to normalize b so that it is measured relative to
the Proposer’s wealth when y is near 0 and the Responder’s wealth when y is near 1.
Finally, recall that the gross benefit from sharing termination risk is captured by the
term

in the reduced Bellman equation of the Proposer (namely (23)). Taking advantage of the
fact that V = CR (ρ W ), v = Cr (ρr w), VP = γ CR0 (W ) and v 0 = γ r Cr0 (w), this term can
be rewritten in the form

for all (y, γ) ∈ (0, 1) × (0, ∞) and all g ∈ (−y −1 , (1 − y)−1 ). However, since CR (1) =

We shall also need the function φ given by the formula

for all (y, γ) ∈ (0, 1) × (0, ∞), and by the formulae
φ(0, γ) = max {Φ(g, 0, γ)}
g∈(−∞,1)

and φ(1, γ) = max {Φ(g, 0, γ)}
g∈(−1,∞)

for all γ ∈ (0, ∞).
We shall refer to χ as the normalized gain from trade and to φ as the normalized gain
from sharing termination risk. Also, since the overall gain from trade is made up of the
gain from sharing termination risk and the gain from sharing investment risk, we refer to
χ − φ as the normalized gain from sharing investment risk.
11.2. A Pair of One-Dimensional Equations. We are now in a position to take the
first major step in the derivation of the one-dimensional version of the reduced Bellman
equation of the Proposer:

with respect to z. Also, the maximand (31) for z involves two terms: a linear incentive
and a quadratic penalty. The linear incentive is simply R − r: the more the risk aversion

Substituting into equation (23), dividing through by (W + w) CR0 (W ), taking advantage
of the notation Φ, putting s = (1 − y) (1 + y z), collecting terms in β, z and z 2 , dividing
through by γ σ 2 y (1 − y) and rearranging therefore yields equation (29). Finally, we have
γ = 1 + (1 − R) ψ + y ψ0
and
ψ = ψR + (1 − y) γ R χ.

42

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

Diﬀerentiating the latter equation to get ψ0 in terms of χ0 , substituting in the former
equation and rearranging, we obtain equation (30).
Next we establish that total endogenous risk aversion, and therefore the quadratic
penalty on leverage, is strictly positive. The proof proceeds in two steps. The first step
shows that total endogenous risk aversion must be non-negative, because otherwise the
two parties would use the Wiener noise to construct bets, and thus arbitrage away the
infinite gains from trade implicit in strictly negative total risk aversion.
Proposition 15. Suppose that R 6= r. Then (1 − y) R + y r −

Proof. Since the maximand in equation (29) is additively separable in g and z,

However, as it stands, this equation is not fully precise: z can take any real value, and
therefore the coeﬃcients of the equation are unbounded. To obtain a precise version of
the equation, we need to normalize by dividing through by 1 + z 2 .21 Cf. Krylov [9]. Doing
so yields

Note that the normalization should in principle be applied consistently throughout the paper. However, we have suppressed it for expositional convenience. We make it explicit here since this is the one
place where it plays an important role.

Hence, noting that s = (1 − y) (1 + y z), we obtain (35). Finally, (34) is the same as (30).
One simple but important implication of the expression (31) for the Proposer’s objective is that: if R > r, then we will have z > 0 for all y ∈ [0, 1] (i.e. the Responder takes
on more than his autarky share of the risk); and, if R < r, then we will have z < 0 for
all y ∈ [0, 1] (i.e. the Responder takes on less than his autarky share of the risk). We
formalize this observation in the following Corollary.
Corollary 17.
1. If R > r then s > 1 − y for all y ∈ (0, 1).
2. If R < r then s < 1 − y for all y ∈ (0, 1). ¥
The proof of Proposition 16 also establishes that the normalized gain from sharing investment risk is strictly positive. Combining this with the fact that φ(y, γ) ≥ Φ(0, y, γ) =
0, we obtain a second Corollary:
Corollary 18. Suppose that R 6= r. Then χ > φ ≥ 0. ¥
Notice that φ = 0 iﬀ g = 0. Moreover, on the basis of the asymptotic expansions given
in Section 10 above, we would expect that g will indeed take the value 0 for some choices
of the parameter values.22 This is confirmed by Figure 7 below.

In particular, if γγ > 0, then there are two eﬀects. First, the endogenous risk aversion − VVPPP

of the Proposer is lower than her exogenous risk aversion − UU 0 . Second, the elasticity − VVwP
P
of the shadow value of transfers VP with respect to changes in the Responder’s wealth w is
strictly positive. The first eﬀect tends to lower the Responder’s share in investment risk:
the Proposer can aﬀord to take on more risk because, if she receives a negative shock,
then this is partially oﬀset by a reduction in the opportunity cost of obtaining insurance;
and, if she receives a positive shock, then this is partially oﬀset by an increase in the
opportunity cost of obtaining insurance. The second eﬀect tends to raise the Responder’s
share in investment risk: obtaining more insurance from the Responder tends to increase
the Responder’s wealth, and increasing the Responder’s wealth decreases the Proposer’s
opportunity cost of obtaining insurance.
It turns out that the second eﬀect always outweighs the first. Indeed, we have

In other words, the Responder takes on more risk under the optimal risk-sharing
rule than he would under the myopic benchmark iﬀ the shadow value of transfers γ is
decreasing in the Responder’s share in total wealth.
12.

The Case of Large Wealth

One of the advantages of the one-dimensional Bellman equation derived in the previous
section is that it allows us to investigate what happens when the wealth of one party
becomes very large relative to the wealth of the other. We can understand what happens
when w → ∞ by examining the limit of the solution of the one-dimensional Bellman
equation as y → 0, and what happens when W → ∞ by examining the limit of the
solution of the one-dimensional Bellman equation as y → 1. In this section, we formulate
suﬃcient conditions under which the relevant limits exist. These conditions are also
suﬃcient conditions for the existence of an optimal constract.
It is natural to begin by requiring that both parties have finite payoﬀs under autarky.
Indeed, from a risk-sharing perspective, the Responder is eﬀectively on his own when
y = 0, and the Proposer is eﬀectively on her own when y = 1. This is what Conditions
I and II ensure. However, when y ∈ (0, 1), there is a gain from risk sharing. Moreover,
when normalized with respect to the wealth of the Responder, this gain will be largest
when y = 1; and, when normalized for the wealth of the Proposer, it will be largest when
y = 0. In order to ensure that the normalized gain from risk sharing does not become
infinite, it therefore suﬃces to ensure that it is finite when y = 1 and y = 0.
Putting y = 1 in equation (33) and rearranging yields
χ(1) − φ(1, γ(1)) =

(45)

Now, 1 + g(1) must be in the domain of the function Cr , i.e. we must have 1 + g(1) > 0.
The right-hand side of equation (45) must therefore also be strictly positive. Putting
γ R = ββ , γ r = ββ and β r = β − (1 − r) (μ − 12 r σ 2 ), and rearranging, shows that this is

Condition III. β > (1 − r) μ − 2 r σ + 2

The best way to understand Condition III is to compare it with Condition I. Condition
I requires that the rate of discounting β must exceed the rate of growth of the Responder’s
utility when his wealth grows at the risk-adjusted rate of return μ − 12 r σ 2 , whereas
Condition III requires that the rate of discounting β must exceed the rate of growth of
2 σ2
+ β R . The latter rate is
utility when wealth grows at the higher rate μ − 12 r σ 2 + 12 (R−r)
r
composed of three terms: the certainty-equivalent rate of return derived from investment,

48

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

namely μ− 12 r σ 2 , the certainty-equivalent rate of return deriving from sharing investment
2 σ2
, and the certainty-equivalent rate of return deriving from sharing
risk, namely 12 (R−r)
r
termination risk, namely β R .23 Moreover Condition II requires precisely that β R > 0.
Hence, assuming that Condition II holds, Condition III is stronger than Condition I when
r < 1: the Responder’s utility function is unbounded above, and his certainty-equivalent
rate of return is larger, so we need more discounting if his expected payoﬀ is to be finite.
Similarly, again assuming that Condition II holds, Condition I is stronger than Condition
III when r > 1: the Responder’s utility function is unbounded below, and his certaintyequivalent rate of return is larger, so we now need less discounting than before in order
to ensure that his expected payoﬀ is finite.
We also need the corresponding condition derived from the case y = 0. Proceeding
analogously to the case y = 1, we obtain the four equations

Similarly, if R = 1, then one can solve the two equations (47) and (48) for the two
unknowns γ(0) and g(0). Doing so yields the appropriate special case of (50). Finally,
putting γ R = ββ , γ r = ββ and β R = β − (1 − R) (μ − 12 R σ 2 ) in (50) and rearranging, we

Condition IV is completely analogous to Condition III. In particular, assuming that
Condition I holds, Condition IV is stronger than Condition II when R < 1, and Condition
II is stronger than Condition IV when R > 1. Furthermore, it can be shown that, in the
case in which both R < 1 and r < 1, Conditions III and IV together imply Conditions I
and II. The discussion of the present section can therefore be summarized as follows.
Proposition 20. A suﬃcient condition for the one-dimensional Bellman equation of the
Proposer, namely (33-34), to have a solution that is continuous on [0, 1] is that both of
the following conditions hold:

In particular, these conditions are suﬃcient for the existence of an optimal contract. ¥
Remark 21. If one is interested primarily in the original problem, in which W > 0 and
w > 0, but not in the extended problem, in which the solution of the one-dimensional
Bellman equation of the Proposer is required to be continuous right up to the boundary,
then Conditions I and II should probably still be regarded as minimal conditions: they
ensure that the outside options of both parties are well defined. However, it may be
possible to weaken Conditions III and IV: if the Proposer’s normalized value diverges as
y → 0, then this may be oﬀset by the fact that her wealth W → 0; and, if the Responder’s
normalized value diverges as y → 1, then this may be oﬀset by the fact that his wealth
w → 0. Investigating this possibility is, however, beyond the scope of the current paper.

Numerical Solutions

In this section we solve the system (33-34) numerically, and use these solutions to compute
the optimal contract. The numerical solutions are obtained using the MatLab program
bvp4c.
The most striking feature of the numerical solutions is the degree to which they conform to the predictions of the asymptotic expansions. The first prediction is quantitative:
there should be three main cases, namely the risk-tolerant case (2 > R > r), the riskaverse case (R > r > 2) and the mixed case (R > 2 > r). The second set of predictions
is qualitative:
1. in the risk-tolerant case, we should have s − s(0) < 0 for all y;
2. in the risk-averse case, we should have s − s(0) > 0 for all y;
3. in the mixed case we should have s − s(0) > 0 for low y and s − s(0) < 0 for high y.
The third set of predictions is again quantitative. Putting B(0) = 2 r− Rr , B(1) = R+r− Rr
and B = 14 r (4 + R):
1. in the risk-tolerant case, we should have b > 0 for all y if 2σμ2 < B(1); b > 0 for low
y and b < 0 for high y if 2σμ2 ∈ (B(1), B(0)); b < 0 for all y if 2σμ2 > B(0).
2. in the risk-averse case, we should have b > 0 for all y if 2σμ2 < B(0); b < 0 for low y
and b > 0 for high y if 2σμ2 ∈ (B(0), B(1)); b < 0 for all y if 2σμ2 > B(1).
3. in the mixed case we should have b > 0 for all y if 2σμ2 < min{B(0), B(1)}; b < 0 for
¡
¢
low y, b > 0 for intermediate y and b < 0 for high y if 2σμ2 ∈ max{B(0), B(1)}, B ;
b < 0 for all y if 2σμ2 > B.24
These predictions are borne out by all the simulations presented here and by numerous
unreported simulations. Moreover it seems likely that the first prediction and the second
set of predictions taken together are in fact a theorem.
We omit the subcase in which 2σμ2 ∈ (min{B(0), B(1)}, max{B(0), B(1)}) since it divides into two
subsubcases depending on whether B(0) < B(1) or B(0) > B(1).

10 2.5 0.12 0.15 0.05
8 1.3 0.10 0.15 0.05

In all three cases: σ = 0.15, which is in line with estimates of the volatility of the US
stock market: and β = 0.05, which is loosely calibrated on estimates of subjective discount
rates. The coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion R and r are then chosen – from within the
range that has been found in empirical studies – to balance two competing objectives:
on the one hand, we do not want the dynamic eﬀects to be swamped by the myopic
eﬀects; but, on the other, we want our simulations to be completely stable.25 The final
parameter μ is then chosen in such a way that Conditions I-IV are satisfied. For example,
in the risk-tolerant case, the cost of risk is low and μ must not be too large; and, in the
risk-averse case, the cost of risk is high and μ must not be too small.
For such a small value of β, we cannot expect our asymptotic expansions – which are
based on the assumption that β is large – to be quantitatively accurate in all respects.26
However, as we shall see, the qualitative predictions – and some of the quantitative
predictions – obtained from these expansions are remarkably accurate even though the
β we actually use is rather small.

three baseline cases. In all cases, both 1−y and 1−y increase from 1 to Rr as y increases
from 0 to 1. They take the value 1 when y = 0, because in that case the Responder
has all the wealth, and so risk sharing with the Proposer has a negligible impact on his
leverage. They are increasing in y because – from the point of view of the Responder
– the opportunities for risk sharing are increasing in y and, as the less risk averse party,
taking advantage of these opportunites means increasing his leverage. Notice that the
leverage of the Responder can be quite substantial when y = 1: in the risk-tolerant case

The size of the diﬀerence 1−y − 1−y between the Responder’s leverage under the optimal
contract and his leverage under the myopic benchmark can be seen more clearly in Figure
5. In the risk-tolerant case, this diﬀerence troughs for y around 0.92, with a value of about
−0.07. At this point the myopic benchmark is around 1.85, so the diﬀerence is about
−3.7% of the benchmark. A somewhat larger eﬀect (reflecting the greater diﬀerence in
risk aversion) is obtained for the risk-averse case: the diﬀerence peaks for y around 0.79,
with a value of about 0.13. At this point the myopic benchmark is around 2.44, so the
diﬀerence is about 5.5% of the benchmark. The largest eﬀects are obtained for the mixed
case. In this case, the diﬀerence first peaks for y around 0.70, with a value of about 0.21,
and then troughs for y around 0.98, with a value of about −0.38. So, in the mixed case,
the extreme diﬀerences are about 8.7% and −6.7% of the benchmark respectively.

Next, 1−y
Responder on termination. Figure 6 shows that, in all three of our baseline cases, this
fraction is 0 when y = 0 and decreases as y increases from 0 to 1. It is zero at y = 0
because the Responder has all the wealth, and any payment from the Proposer to the
Responder is therefore negligible relative to the Responder’s wealth. It is negative for
y > 0 because the investment opportunity is valuable, and it is therefore the Responder
who compensates the Proposer when it terminates. What is perhaps most striking is the
sheer size of the payments made by the Responder: in the risk-tolerant case, he pays out
about 62% of his wealth when y = 1; in the risk-averse case, he pays out about 26%;

Conclusion

In this paper we have analyzed an optimal risk-sharing problem in which two parties invest
in a common constant-returns-to-scale risky asset. The two parties have diﬀerent coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion, and they start with diﬀerent wealth endowments. We have
taken out many interesting features from the model to keep the analysis tractable. In particular, we have only allowed for consumption at the end, and we have only considered an
extreme bargaining situation in which one of the parties can make take-it-or-leave-it oﬀers
to the other. Within this model we have, however, been able to push the characterization
of optimal risk-sharing quite far.
For example, we have used asymptotic expansions to obtain approximations to the
optimal risk-sharing rules. These approximations capture in a transparent way the main
tradeoﬀs that the contracting parties face. Moreover numerical simulations confirm that
the picture that they generate is qualitatively (and sometimes quantitatively) accurate.
The approximations can be decomposed into a myopic benchmark and a dynamic
correction. In the case of the optimal rule s for the Responder’s share in investment risk,
the myopic benchmark s(0) is the classical ratio of the Proposer’s absolute risk aversion
to the sum of the Proposer’s and the Responder’s absolute risk aversions, namely

where R and r are the coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion of the Proposer and the Responder, and W and w are their wealths. This formula captures the basic aspects of
risk sharing. For example, the wealthier or the less risk averse the Proposer, the less the
investment risk taken on by the Responder.
The myopic benchmark does not, however, capture counterparty risk. For example,
if the Responder is risk neutral (i.e. if r = 0), then it predicts that the Responder will
take on all the investment risk. However, if the Responder took on all the investment
risk, then he would run out of wealth in finite time. The Proposer would thereafter not
be able to obtain any insurance. In other words, the Responder’s insurance capacity is
finite, and the Proposer should take this into account by adjusting the risk-sharing rule
to conserve it as it begins to run low.
These ideas are captured by the dynamic correction β1 s(1) , which can be written in
the form
1
R r σ 2 y 2 (1 − y)2
2
(R − r)3 ((1 − y) R + y r − 2) ,
β ((1 − y) R + y r)5
where β is the hazard rate of termination, σ is the volatility of investment returns and
y = WW+w is the Proposer’s share in total wealth. This formula for the dynamic correction
is the product of three terms. The first is always positive, so the sign of the dynamic
correction is determined by two considerations: whether the Proposer is more risk averse
than the Responder, in the sense that R > r; and whether the average risk aversion of
the two parties is large, in the sense that (1 − y) R + y r > 2. (As each party’s coeﬃcient
of relative risk aversion is weighted by the other party’s share in total wealth, it is the
risk aversion of the poorer party that matters most in this inequality.)
The three key predictions from this formula for the dynamic correction are then as
follows. First, if both investors are fairly risk tolerant (in the sense that R, r < 2), then
the investor who is more risk averse takes on a larger share of total investment risk than
she would under the myopic benchmark. Indeed, the investor who is less risk averse is
willing to take on risk on relatively unfavourable terms. So the more risk he takes on, the
sooner he will run out of wealth. The optimal dynamic contract therefore transfers less
risk to him than the optimal myopic contract.
Second, if both investors are fairly risk averse (in the sense that R, r > 2), then the
investor who is more risk averse takes on a smaller share of total investment risk than
she would under the myopic benchmark. This is because the investor who is less risk
averse is only willing to take on risk on relatively favourable terms. So taking on more

The Dynamics of Optimal Risk Sharing

56

risk actually delays the time at which he will run out of wealth. The optimal dynamic
contract therefore transfers more risk to him than the optimal myopic contract.
Third, if one investor is fairly risk averse and the other is fairly risk tolerant (in the
sense that R > 2 > r or r > 2 > R), then the investor who is more risk averse takes on a
smaller share of total investment risk when her wealth is small and a larger share when
her wealth is large. This is because, while she would like to reduce the amount of risk
transferred to her risk-tolerant counterparty, the cost of bearing the extra risk herself is
too high when her wealth is low.
In sum, the approximations to the optimal risk-sharing rule s we have derived capture
in a relatively simple way the tradeoﬀ between getting more insurance coverage today and
preserving future insurance options. Moreover, these rules are explicit and easy to apply.
