Historical Evidence on the Finance-Trade-Growth Nexus

ABSTRACT
We study linkages between financial development, international trade, and long-run growth using
data since 1880 for seventeen now-developed “Atlantic” economies and a set of cross-country and
dynamic panel data models. We find that finance and trade reinforced each other before 1930, but
that these effects did not persist after the Second World War. Financial development has positive effects
on growth throughout the sample period, while trade affects growth strongly and independently after
1945. We attribute the rising importance of trade in explaining growth to major post-World War II
changes in tariffs and quantity restrictions associated with the GATT, the establishment of the European
Common Market, and the gradual elimination of capital controls after 1973. The findings are robust
to the use of ‘deep’ fundamentals such as legal origin and indicators of the political environment as
instruments for financial development and trade. Financial development, however, is more closely
linked to these fundamentals than trade.

1. Introduction
The relationship between financial development and economic growth is now well
established in studies using both recent data (e.g., King and Levine, 1993; Levine, Loayza and
Beck, 2000) and historical data (e.g., Rousseau and Sylla, 2003).1 Another rich literature shows a
positive role for trade openness and export orientation in long-run growth (e.g., Dollar, 1992;
Ben-David, 1993; Sachs and Warner, 1995; Edwards, 1998). Yet intersections among these two
strands of the growth literature have been rare and fleeting, particularly when it comes to
interactions between trade and financial development.2
Rajan and Zingales (2003a, b) contribute to the discussion with a framework in which a
country’s opening to trade spurs financial development, international integration and growth by
weakening the power of economic and political incumbencies that may block financial
liberalization. In this paper we emphasize that their channel can be particularly potent as an
economy modernizes if developments in the financial and commercial sectors are mutually
reinforcing, and present evidence that the channel might have operated during the first wave of
economic globalization among the rapidly-developing economies of Europe and the Americas
that occurred between 1870 and the start of the First World War. Specifically, we find that
financial development and trade reinforced each other from 1880 to 1930, which is consistent
with the Rajan and Zingales interpretation, but that these linkages broke down after the Second
World War, with both finance and trade continuing to have independent influences on growth
after 1945.
Levine (2005) offers a thorough survey of the vast empirical literature on finance and growth
that has burgeoned over the past two decades.

Recent exceptions are Baltagi et al. (2009) and Demetriades and Rousseau (2010), which
pursue the nexus between finance and trade with recent data for a wider range of countries.

1

Our starting point is a classic regression from King and Levine (1993, Table 8, p. 731) in
which international trade and liquid liabilities enter together as percentages of gross domestic
product on the right hand side of an otherwise standard cross-country growth specification using
data for 57 developed and developing countries from 1960 to 1989. They find that financial
development is linked to growth but that trade is not, and interpret a small effect of trade’s
inclusion in the model on the coefficient for financial development as supportive of their main
hypothesis that finance has an independent influence on growth.
Regressions such as this, however, do not control explicitly for the possibility that trade
and openness influence growth indirectly through the financial sector and that these effects vary
with the stages of a country’s development. By considering continuous data for seventeen
“Atlantic” economies over the period from 1880 through 2004, we seek to understand the
evolving role of trade in growth as financial systems emerge and mature.3
We also consider whether the roles of financial development and trade in promoting
growth can be encompassed by “deeper” fundamentals. These could include a nation’s legal
origin, which presumably reflects its willingness and ability to protect individual property rights
(e.g., La Porta et al., 1997, 1998; Beck, Demirgü -Kunt and Levine, 2002; Beck and Levine,
2005), and indicators of the political environment, including those related to democratic
principles (e.g., Barro, 1991; Barro and Lee, 1994; Alesina and Perotti, 1994; and Alesina et al.,
1996; Haber, 2003; Bordo and Rousseau, 2006). We believe that the political environment may
be particularly interesting because, unlike legal origin, it can and does evolve over time.
The seventeen countries that we consider are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. Though not all lie on the Atlantic coast, all were
important parts of the late-nineteenth century trading community than spanned the Atlantic and
beyond.

Our results suggest that the component of financial development directly related to legal
origin and the political environment is strongly related to growth throughout our 125-year
sample, while the similar component of trade does not share such a persistent linkage. We
interpret this as suggesting that financial development is “primal” to growth and that trade
generally follows finance in affecting growth later in the development process. At the same time,
the role of trade in post-World War II growth is very strong in these economies.

2. Data and methodology
The analysis is based upon seventeen countries for which we have continuous data since
1880. The macroeconomic data, including population, M2, imports, exports, growth in real gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the GDP deflator are from the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators for the post-1960 period and from worksheets underlying Obstfeld and
Taylor (2000), Bordo and Jonung (1987), Rousseau and Wachtel (1998), and Rousseau (1999)
for earlier years. The levels of GDP per capita are from Maddison (2003) and expressed in
constant 1990 international Geary-Khamis dollars. We measure financial development as the
ratio of broad money (M2) to GDP, which primarily reflects the size of a country’s banking
system. Ideally we would like an additional measure of financial development such as the ratio
of stock market capitalization to GDP, but this is not available over the full period of our study.4
We work with the ratio of the sum of exports and imports to GDP as our measure of trade and
openness, which is something of a standard in empirical growth studies.

Beck, Demirgü -Kunt and Levine (2002, p. 40) report a correlation coefficient of 0.664 for
averages of bank and market-based measures of financial development from 1990 to 1995 in a
cross-section of 115 countries, and so the ratio of broad money to GDP should reflect the size of
a more broadly-defined capital market reasonably well.

4

We begin the analysis with a cross-country growth regression based on the framework
developed in Barro (1991) and extended to the study of financial development and growth by
King and Levine (1993). It has the form
Growth Yit = 0 + Yit + FDit + γTRD it + Φt + µit,

(1)

where the dependent variable is the average percentage growth rate of real per capita income
over period t, which can be five or ten years in length, Yit is the logarithm of its level at the start
of period t, FDit and TRDit are measures of financial development and trade respectively, the Φt
are dummy variables for each five or ten-year period, and µit is the error term. We expect a
negative coefficient on the log of initial real per capita GDP due to the tendency for growth rates
to converge across countries and over time.
We estimate equation (1) over five different time spans using four techniques. The first
time span considers ten-year averages of the dependent variable for each of the twelve decades
from 1880 to 1999. Our sub-samples use five-year averages of the dependent variable. 5 The first
covers the pre-World War I (1880-1914) era, while the second continues this period to the start
of the Great Depression (1880-1929). We work with two post-World War II samples, one
commencing immediately in 1945 and running through 2004, and another starting in 1960 for
comparability with empirical growth studies using more recent data.
The first estimation is by ordinary least squares using initial values of all explanatory
variables in each five or ten-year period to reduce simultaneity biases that could arise from the
Since the data from 1880 to 1999 span a lengthy time period, we are able to focus on longerterm growth effects with ten-year averages while keeping the sample size reasonably large. The
sub-periods capture more medium term effects, but the five-year averaging should still
adequately smooth out high frequency business cycle fluctuations in the data.

influence of growth on the financial and trading sectors. The second estimation uses the five or
ten-year averages of financial development and trade as regressors with their initial values as
instrumental variables. We also report results obtained with the system generalized method of
moments (GMM) estimator developed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond
(1998).6 In these specifications the ratios of broad money and trade to GDP enter as lagged
averages from the previous period.
Our next set of regressions considers the ratios of broad money and trade to GDP as
dependent variables and takes the form
TRDit = 0 +  Yit + FDit + γINFLit + δt + µit, and

(2)

FDit = 0 +  Yit + TRDit + γINFLit + δt + µit,

(3)

with variables defined as in equation (1). We include annual growth of the GDP deflator (INFL)
as a control variable because a growing literature (e.g., Boyd, Levine, and Smith, 2001;
Rousseau and Wachtel, 2002) suggests that high inflation, which is usually related to variable
inflation, can lead to difficulties in nominal contracting and in turn dampen or even reverse
financial development. Inflation is likely to hinder trade for much the same reason. We also
include initial per capita real income on the right-hand side because higher incomes are likely to
be associated with more economic activity and a greater than proportionate increase in the
demand for financial assets and services. Once again we estimate these systems by ordinary least
squares with initial values on the right hand side, by two-stage least squares with period averages
of financial development or trade instrumented by their initial values, and as a dynamic panel.

6

Our use of the “System GMM” estimator parallels that introduced to the study of finance and
growth by Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000).
5

Our final estimation of the growth model in equation (1) considers the role of deep
fundamentals related to legal origin and the political environment in providing the identifying
variation in financial development and trade that influences growth. In other words, we estimate
the growth specification in equation (1) using a host of legal and political variables as
instruments for the five or ten-year averages of financial development and trade.
Following La Porta et al. (1997), Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United
States have English legal origin, Argentina, Brazil, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain have French legal origin, Germany and Japan have German legal origin, and Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden have Scandinavian legal origin. We denote the legal origin of
each country with dummy variables. The variables reflecting the political environment are those
found by Bordo and Rousseau (2006) to be related robustly to financial development. Starting
with the wide variety of political indicators collected by LeBlang (2004), we found that the
average numbers of elections per year, the average number of revolutions or coups per year, and
whether or not the electoral system is based on proportional representation had the greatest
explanatory power.

3. Empirical findings
3a. Growth regressions
Table 1 presents growth regressions that include financial development, trade, the log of
initial real per capita income, and a full set of dummy variables for time periods on the right
hand side. Estimation in panel (a) is by ordinary least squares, with financial development and
trade entering the model as initial values in each five or ten-year period. In all subsamples the
coefficient on the log of the initial per capita income is negative as expected, and is statistically

Standard errors are in parentheses. When used, variable averages are computed over each
decade for 1880-1999 and every five years for the 1880-1914, 1880-1929, 1945-2004, and

significant in all but one (1880-1914). 7 More interestingly, the coefficients on financial
development are positive and statistically significant at the ten percent level or less with the
exception of the coefficient for 1880-1914, which just misses the ten percent cutoff. The
coefficients on financial development are also meaningful in an economic sense. For example,
the coefficient of 1.499 from the first column of panel (a) suggests that increasing the ratio of
broad money to GDP from, say, 0.5 to 1.0 would raise the annual growth rate by about 0.75
percent. The implied growth effects for the 1880-1914 and 1880-1929 sub-periods are even
larger. The coefficients on the initial value of trade to GDP are also positive for each sub-period
in panel (a), but are statistically significant only for 1945-2004 and 1960-2004.
The results in panel (b) of Table 1 are similar to those in panel (a) and show robustness to
estimation with averages of financial development and trade instrumented by their own initial
values. The system GMM results in panel (c) show even larger effects of financial development
and trade on growth, with the coefficient on trade positive and statistically significant over the
full 1880-1999 period as well as the two post-World War II sub-samples. The dynamic nature of
the GMM model may be driving these stronger results, though the dynamics also require losing
the first five or ten-year observation for each country in each sub-period.
Overall, the growth regressions in Table 1 send a clear message: financial development is
strongly linked to growth for these seventeen economies throughout the 1880-2004 period, while
trade appears to have a strong relation with growth after 1945. This could mean that trade
became growth-promoting only at later stages of these countries’ economic development and in a
manner unrelated to financial development, but economic history tells us that this is probably not
We exclude inflation from the growth regressions because a number of studies (e.g., Bruno and
Easterly, 1998; Rousseau and Wachtel, 2002) show that negative relationships between inflation
and growth in cross-country data are driven by extreme observations such as hyper-inflations.

the case. Rather, finance and trading arrangements are normally thought to have co-evolved in
the early stages of market emergence (e.g., Cassis, 2007). Though we lack sufficient data for
enough of these countries going back to the earliest stages of organized trade and commerce, we
can examine these cross-relationships since 1880, which includes the period leading up to World
War I that is generally agreed to represent the “golden” era of globalization.

3b. Trade and financial development regressions
Table 2 presents estimates of regression equation (2) with the ratio of international trade
to GDP as the dependent variable. The log of initial real GDP per capita enters with the positive
sign that we expect throughout and is statistically significant for all but one specification (i.e., the
dynamic model in panel (c) for 1880-1914), and inflation has the expected negative relationship
with trade but is not statistically significant for two of the dynamic regressions. The main result
of interest in Table 2 is that the coefficient on financial development is positive and statistically
significant in the 1880-1914 and 1880-1929 sub-samples for all three model specifications and
estimation techniques, and that this relationship appears to break down after 1945.
Table 3 reverses the specification in Table 2, placing financial development on the left
hand side and international trade on the right as in equation (3). The log of initial GDP per capita
once again enters with a positive sign that is now statistically significant in all cases. Inflation,
when statistically significant, enters the financial development equations with the expected
negative sign. It is also clear that trade is related to financial development in the pre-1930
subsamples, but not for the post-World War II periods.
The results in Table 3 suggest that the possibility of a role for trade in economic growth
in the early stages of market emergence should not be so readily dismissed. Trade and financial

development seem to reinforce each other prior to 1929. The finding that trade is dynamically
linked to financial development in Table 3 while finance is dynamically linked to growth in
Table 1 also suggests that trade and openness had indirect effects on growth that operated
through finance. The results for both of the post-World War II sub-samples, however, show that
these relationships did not persist as the financial sectors of the countries in our sample matured.
The result for the earlier periods tends to confirm the central and bi-directional role of the
emergence of commerce in the development of financing arrangements emphasized by economic
historians. Rajan and Zingales (2003a, b) also treat openness to trade as a key element to
financial development working through the political economy of incumbency.

3c. ‘Deep’ fundamentals in the finance-trade-growth nexus
We now explore how well the components of finance and trade that are determined by
our legal and political indicators explain growth, and compare our findings to those obtained
with the more typical instrumental variables regressions in panel (b) of Table 1 where initial
values of financial development and trade serve as instruments. Table 4 reports on growth
regressions with our legal origin and political variables as instruments for the contemporaneous
five or ten-year averages of financial development and trade. The two-stage instrumental
variables technique is equivalent to running a pair of first stage regressions of financial
development and trade on initial income, time dummies, legal origin, and the political variables,
and then inserting the fitted values into the second-stage growth regression that we report in the
table. Overall, the coefficients on financial development and trade are similar to those obtained
in the standard instrumental variables regression reported in panel (b) of Table 1, though they are
somewhat larger in all of the sub-periods and considerably larger for 1880-1999. This suggests

that the indicator variables for legal origin and the political environment are perhaps better
instruments for financial development than the initial level of finance.8 It may also be that the
deeper fundamentals are “cutting through” the noise in standard measures of financial
development to isolate the portion that matters for growth.9

Hansen tests for the over-identified specifications in Table 4 do not reject the validity of the
political and legal variables as instruments for financial development and trade at conventional
significance levels.

We also estimate a set of instrumental variables regressions for equations (2) and (3) that are
similar to those in panel (b) of Tables 2 and 3, except that we use our legal and political variables
as instruments for the contemporaneous averages of financial development or trade. We find that
neither trade nor financial development is driven by the components of the other that are
determined by these instruments. This indicates that the legal and political indicators isolate
identifying variation in financial development and trade that are pertinent to growth, but that
there are other reasons, addressed below, why financial development and trade had reinforcing
effects prior to the First World War and the Great Depression.

countries in our sample with French legal origin did not seem to be at a disadvantage to those
with English legal origin in the pre-1930 sub-periods, but have significantly higher levels of
financial development after the Second World War. Further, countries with German legal origin
outperform both English and French systems with our measure of financial development in all

14

periods.10 Countries with Scandinavian legal systems have more financial development in the
1880-1914 and 1880-1929 periods, and this linkage is strong enough to affect the results for the
full 1880-1999 period. We also note that the switch of the dummy variable for Scandinavian
legal origin to statistical significance in the post-1945 sample and the loss of statistical
significance for the French systems are difficult to square with the “law and finance” hypothesis,
which proposes that legal origin affects institutional development consistently whenever
measured.
Turning to the political variables, having a proportional representation system (as
opposed to a majoritarian system) is associated with significantly higher levels of financial
development in the pre-1930 samples and over the full period, but not in the post-World War II
samples, while the number of revolutions and coups always has the expected negative sign but is
statistically significant only over the full period and 1880-1929. The frequency of elections
seems unrelated to financial development in our multivariate specification. The R2 statistics for
the first stage are reasonably large for all sub-periods, indicating that a good deal of the
variability in financial development can be explained by our legal and political factors.
We examine the first stage regression for trade in Table 6. In contrast to Table 5, we now
find both French and Scandinavian legal origin strongly associated with trade throughout our
sub-periods, while countries with proportional representation systems seem to have more trade
than those with majoritarian systems after 1945.
The results in Table 5 and Table 6 indicate that links from deeper fundamentals to trade
are weaker than the links to finance. Trade seems to matter for growth, especially more recently,
but seems to have more of an independent influence than one driven by deeper fundamentals.
Beck and Levine (2005) find that countries with German legal origin have the highest average
levels of financial development from 1990-1995 with both bank and market-based measures, but
that this result is strongest for bank-based measures.

4. Conclusion
We study linkages between financial development and trade and their role in promoting
economic growth using historical data for a group of now-developed “Atlantic” economies since
1880. Our main findings are that finance and trade reinforced each other during the 1880-1914
and 1880-1929 periods, but that these links vanished after the Second World War. Financial
development is also strongly related to growth throughout our sample period, while trade matters

16

for growth only after 1945. The growth findings are robust to using as explanatory variables only
those components of financial development and trade that are determined by fundamentals
related to legal origin and the political environment. Finally, we find financial development to be
more closely related to these fundamentals before 1930 than later, while trade is more closely
related to fundamentals after the Second World War.
The openings to trade that occurred among many countries in our sample late in the
nineteenth century may have promoted financial development prior to the First World War by
breaking down the power of incumbencies that had been able to generate rents by controlling the
provision of finance. Rajan and Zingales (2003a, b) make this point, while Haber (2003), in a
study of the economy of Mexico from 1876 to 1929, argues that the political instability that often
accompanies the fall of incumbencies need not affect growth negatively as freer markets emerge.
Another example of a declining incumbency around the time of the First World War
involved the United States and the development of a domestic market in bankers’ acceptances
(i.e., two-name paper). Before this, importers and exporters would be required to finance
international trade with sterling bills (i.e., bankers’ acceptances) issued in London by British
merchant banks. This allowed British merchant banks to dominate international commerce (with
a supplementary role for banks in Paris and Berlin issuing bills in francs and marks). Indeed, the
U.S. National Banking laws in effect from 1864 until the founding of the Federal Reserve in
1914 did not allow national banks (with a very few exceptions) to issue bankers’ acceptances. A
market in less-liquid single-name paper (i.e., commercial bills) which financed domestic trade
developed instead. This state of affairs reflected the ability of the national banks in the interior
(i.e., the “incumbents”) to prevent the New York City banks from creating a market for bankers’
acceptances that would have increased their profitability (Broz, 1997). When the Federal Reserve
Act finally allowed national banks to deal in acceptances and the Federal Reserve Bank of New
17

York helped to create an acceptance market through a wide variety of banks, mainly in New
York City, it opened the door for U.S. firms to finance international trade using less costly dollar
bills of exchange rather than sterling bills, thereby promoting international trade (Bordo and
Wheelock, 2011, pp. 9-10).
The rise of the dollar as a competitor to sterling in the 1920s also helped to break down
the dominance of London, which was the “incumbent” of the time, as the main provider of global
trade finance (Eichengreen, 2011, Ch. 2). The eventual rise to dominance of the dollar as an
international currency after World War I increased competition in the market for trade finance
and may have contributed to the strong link between trade and finance that we find prior to 1929.
An explanation for why the linkage between trade and finance weakened after 1945 is
also related to the Rajan and Zingales view of incumbencies. In particular, as trade barriers are
lifted and economies opened, financial sectors surge to fund the wave of new economic activity.
This surge in finance is essential as economies transition from a state of lower growth to a new
higher-growth environment. Once the transition is complete, however, trade and finance may
settle into a new equilibrium relationship where the interplay among them is driven more by real
factors than mutually reinforcing effects.
We also posit that the growing importance of trade for growth after 1945 is closely
related to the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by twenty-three
countries in 1947 and its expansion in later rounds leading up to the establishment of the World
Trade Organization in 1995. With the GATT came rapid relaxations of tariffs and quantity
restrictions on a wide range of traded commodities that began to re-establish international
linkages that had been severed by the First World War and the high tariff barriers that followed it
(Irwin, 1995; Bordo, Eichengreen and Irwin, 1999). Another factor has been the growth and
expansion of the European Economic Community (i.e., the “common market”) from its
18

beginning in 1957. With the EEC has come a new, second era of enhanced integration among the
member nations, and this has continued with the establishment of the European Union. The
gradual elimination of capital controls after 1973 complemented the opening up of international
trade.
Despite our finding that indicators of legal origin and the political environment explain
much of the cross-sectional variation in financial development and to a lesser extent in trade, we
were surprised that financial development mattered for growth and that trade mattered for
financial development even at times when direct links from the deeper fundamentals to finance
and trade seemed less operable. Consistent with Haber (2003) and Bordo and Rousseau (2006),
we consider this as evidence that having a deep and well-developed financial sector and strong
trading arrangements offers benefits for long-term growth even when institutional underpinnings
are less robust. This is not to say that sound institutions are an unimportant ingredient in growthenhancing financial and commercial sectors, but it does suggest that the study of traditional
channels such as capital accumulation and the overcoming of indivisibilities in investment along
with institutional origins will in the end help us to understand more fully how and why finance
and trade matter for growth.
