ABSTRACT

The provision of social security benefits to retirees distorts the saving
decisions of workers who are rational enough to save for their future. Since the
implicit rate of return in an unfunded social security program is less than the
marginal product of capital, the resulting decline in saving causes a welfare
loss. It has been suggested that this welfare loss could be reduced, while still
protecting those who lack the foresight to save for their retirement (the
"myopes" and "partial myopes" of the paper), by replacing the current universal
social security program with a means-tested program that pays benefits only to
the "myopic" individuals who have little or no other retirement income or
assets.
The present paper evaluates this suggestion with the help of an explicit
steady-state welfare comparison of the optimal universal and optimal
means-tested programs. The relative welfare levels depend on characteristics of
the economy (the growth rates of population and real wages and the productivity
of capital) and of the population (the frequency and degree of myopia with
respect to saving for retirement).
The analysis shows that, although a means tested program is generally
superior, it does not always dominate the best alternative universal program.
A universal program can be preferable under conditions which imply that the
optimal means-tested program would induce rational savers to stop saving. The
analysis also implies that overall welfare can be increased by using different
social security programs for different groups of workers if the working
population as a whole can be divided into two or more subgroups with different
mixes of myopes, partial myopes and rational life-cycle savers.

SHOULD SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS BE MEANS-TESTED?

Martin Feldsteinl

Every society must solve the problem of supporting those individuals who
become too old to work but have not made adequate provision for their own old

age by saving when they were young. At the present time, the major
industrial countries of the world have responded to this problem by creating
social security programs that tax the working population and use the proceeds
to provide a "universal" benefit to all retirees regardless of their
financial condition.

This universal provision of social security benefits distorts the saving
decisions of those workers who are rational enough to plan for the future.2
Since the implicit rate of return that taxpayers get on their contributions
to an unfunded social security program is less than the return available on

Private Economy.
2For a discussion of the effect of promised retirement benefits on the
savings of employees, see Feldstein (1974, 1982a). Barro (1974, 1978) has
discussed an interesting special case in which social security would have no
effect on private saving. His conclusion requires that each individual acts
to maximize a utility function that has as one of its arguments the utility of
his children, and that the initial optimum behavior involves a positive amount
of bequest. Of course, if everyone exhibited such rationality, there would be
rio need or justification for social security retirement benefits. The Barro
conditions imply that social security does not change aggregate savings but
some individuals may save more while others save less. Every individual's
savings will be unchanged only if all individuals in each current and future
generation are alike. [Footnote continued on next page]

savings invested in real capital,3 the individual who substitutes social
security tax Contributions for private savings suffers a welfare loss equal to
the present value of the difference between the social security benefits and
the amount of future income that the displaced savings would have earned.4
The basic problem of designing a social security program is to set the level
of benefits (and the conditions for receiving benefits) in the way that best
balances the desirability of protecting those who would otherwise make
inadequate provisions for their old age against the cost of reduced saving by
those who would otherwise save in a rational way.5

Feldstein (1974) showed that the provision of social security benefits
that are conditional on retirement can increase personal saving if the effect
on saving of the induced increase in retirement outweighs the asset
substitution effect. Sheshinskj and Weiss (1981), Abel (1984) and Hubbard
(1984) examine the implications of uncertain mortality and the absence of
perfect annuity markets f or the effect of social security on saving.
Although there is a wide range of empirical estimates of the effect of
social security on private saving, the bulk of the evidence appears to this
author to support the conclusion that increases in social security benefits
reduce private saving. Studies supporting this conclusion include Blinder,
Gordon and Wise (1983) and Diamond and Hausman (1984). Those who find little
or no effect of social security on savings include Lesnoy and Learner (1982)
and Munnell (1975).
3Paul Samuelson's (1958) classic article showed that the implicit rate
of return in an unfunded social security program is the rate of growth of
aggregate wages. Samuelson considered the special case in which real wages
per worker are constant, making the implicit rate of return on social
security equal to the rate of growth of population.

4See Feldstejn (1982b). There is a further source of welfare loss to the
rational individual if the social security program distorts labor supply
either during working years (because the reward to working is reduced by the
social security tax to an extent that is not compensated by the present value
of future benefits) or at an age when retirement is possible (because
potential benefits are reduced in whole or in part if the individual
continues to work.) See Gustman and Steinmeier (1983) and Danziger et al.
(1981) for recent discussions of these issues. The present analysis
abstracts from these issues by assuming that the quantity of labor supplied
and the age of retirement are both fixed.

a universal social security program for two alternative specifications of

—3—

Milton Friedman (1972) and others have suggested that the common system
of universal eligibility for social security retirement benefits be replaced

by a means-tested program that pays benefits only to those who lack assets
or private pension income with which to finance adequate post-retirement

consumption. Proponents of this change argue that limiting benefits only to
those in financial need would reduce the size of the program and therefore
the distortionary effect of the tax that is used to pay for it.

It is also

argued that, since rational savers would receive no benefits, their

saving

would be influenced only by the presumably modest amount of tax that they pay

to finance the means-tested benefits. Despite the potential magnitude of the
welfare gain, the proposal for a means-tested program has not previously been
the subject of theoretical or empirical analysis.
Some social security specialists oppose switching to a means-tested
program because, they argue, there is a stigma attached to accepting

means—tested benefits which is undesirable in itself and which discourages

eligible individuals from applying for benefits. In addition, eligible
individuals may fail to receive benefits because they do not understand that

they are entitled to benefits.6
In assessing these arguments it is of course difficult to know how much
value to place on avoiding the stigma per se that accompanies means-tested

benefits. it is in principle easier to evaluate the welfare cost of
individuals' failure to apply for means-tested benefits because of such

imperfect foresight. For evidence on the significance of inadequate
retirement savings, see Diamond (1977) and Kotlikoff et al. (1982).

6See Cohen (1972). For more general discussions of social security
policy and proposals for reform, see Boskin (1977), Feldstein (1975, 1977,
1985b), and Munnell (1977).

stigma or because of ignorance of eligibility. Moreover, experience with
other means—tested and conditional programs suggests that the utilization
rate of means-tested retirement benefits by eligible individuals would

increase over time and could be raised by education and advertising. The
potential gains to rational savers of switching the program to a means—tested
basis makes it worthwhile to look beyond the stigma issue and to evaluate

more formally the choice between universal and means-tested programs. That
is the purpose of the present paper.

The analysis shows that there may be a strong case for a means-tested
program but that it is more ambiguous than the casual analysis of Friedman

and others would suggest. Although a means-tested program may be smaller in
total size than a universal program, it does not necessarily produce greater
social welfare even when the implicit return on social security taxes is

substantially lower than the return available on private saving. The analysis
in this paper shows two reasons why an optimal program of universal
unconditional benefits would, under certain conditions, provide a higher level

of social welfare than an optimal program of benefits conditioned by a
means-test.

The principal reason that a universal program may be superior is that a
means-tested program with benefits set at the optimal level may induce some

utility—maximizing workers to save nothing. Although their resulting
consumption in retirement would then be less than they would have chosen
without a social security program, the utility value of the extra consumption
during working years more than offsets the reduced consumption during

retirement. For these individuals, the means-tested program distorts savings

—5—

and reduces individual utility by more than a universal program. If that
group is large enough in the population, the universal program may be more
desirable than a means-tested program.

It is also possible for the universal program to be superior even if the
benefits in the alternative means-tested program are set at a level that does

not induce any utility-maximizing workers to stop saving. This can occur
if, in order to avoid inducing the utility—maximizers to stop saving, the
level of the means-tested benefits has to be set substantially lower than

would otherwise be optimal. In this case, switching from a universal program
to a means-tested program reduces the welfare of those who receive the
constrained means-tested benefits by more than it increases the welfare of
the nonrecipients.

In general, the choice between a means-tested program and a universal
program depends on the parameters of the economy (in particular the growth
rates of income and population and the rate of return on real investments)
and on the character and extent of economic shortsightedness among the

working population. The nature of this dependence is examined in the present
paper. The specific results in the very simple models examined here are of
course only suggestive but they do indicate some important qualitative
properties that may be robust and suggest a framework for a more realistic
detailed analysis.

The fact that the optimal choice between a means-tested program and a
universal program depends on the character of the working population has an

important general implication for the design of social security programs. It
implies that, if the working population can be subdivided into groups that

-6-•

differ in the relevant parameters, it may be optimal to have a means-tested

program for some groups and a universal program for others. The specific
implications of this are discussed in the final section of the present paper.

1.

The Optimal Program in a Two Class Society
It is useful to begin the analysis with the simple case in which workers

are either fully rational life—cycle utility maximizers (or "cyclers" for
short) or completely myopic individuals who always consume their entire net

income ("myopes"). in this case, a means-tested program will produce higher
social welfare than a universal program unless the level of means-tested
benefits must be reduced substantially below the unconstrained optimum in

order to prevent the cyclers from becoming non-savers. Such a constraint may
be binding because allowing the cyclers to become non—savers would imply that
the means-tested program was no longer selective but provided benefits to all

retirees. The present section shows conditions under which such a constraint
causes the universal program to be optimal. It also develops the basic
structure of the analysis that is then extended in the next section to deal

with a more heterogeneous population in which an optimal means-tested program
will induce workers with limited myopia to stop saving.
The analysis is set in an overlapping generations model of the type

developed by Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965). Individuals live for two
periods, working in the first and being fully retired in the second. At time
t there are Lt workers and Lt_i retirees. The population grows at rate n
per period, implying that Lt =
g; thus w. =

(1+g)w1.

(1+n)Lt...i.

Real wages per worker grow at rate

The rate of return on capital is r per period.

—7—

It will simplify notation and interpretation in the analysis that follows
if we define x =

(1+n)(1+g)/(1+r),

the ratio of "one plus the growth rate of

aggregate wages" to "one plus the rate of return on capital." Since the
growth rate of aggregate wages is the implicit rate of return on social
security, x measures the efficiency of social security "saving" relative to
savings invested in real capital.

A fraction i

of

workers are myopes who always consume their entire

earnings during their working period. The remaining 1i choose a saving
level during their working years that maximizes lifetime utility, u(Cit,

C2t+i) where C1.

is

consumption in period t of workers and C2.1 is

consumption of retirees in period t+1. To be able to derive explicit values
of consumption and utility, I shall assume that the lifetime utility function
is loglinear: u(Cit,

C2t+i)

=

ln

C1. +

in

1.1 A Universal Social Security Program
When there is a universal social security program, the government levies

a tax at rate e on wages and uses the proceeds to finance concurrent

benefits of b to each retiree. The budget constraint of a universal social
security program is
(1)

t'-t =

bLt_1

or
(2)

b = (1+n)8w.
Myopes consume

=

(1—e)w during their working years and C21 =

b1

when they are retired. Cyclers choose C1 to maximize lifetime utility

subject to the personal budget constraint C21 = ((1—e)w- C1)(1+r) +
Optimal first period consumption is therefore C =

o.5[(1-e)wt

+

b1/(1+r)]

—8—

=

and the corresponding second period consumption is

0.5[(1—e)w(1+r) + b1]. Using the government's budget constraint (equation 2)
to write b1 =
x =

=

(1+n)8w+i (1+n)(1+g)ew and recalling that
(1+n)(1+g)/(1+r) is the efficiency of social security savings,

yields

C 0.5[(1—e) + ex]w and C÷1= 0.5{(1—e) + ex](1+r)w.
Total utility at time t is the sum of the utilities of the Lt workers and

the Lti retirees. With a program of universal social security benefits,
total utility at time t iS:

(3)

W = L[gi

ln(1_e)W + (1—ji) ln 0.5(1—8 + 8x)w]

+ Lt 1[t.i in b + (1—li) ln 0.5(1—8 + 8x)(1+r)w1]

After substituting b =

(1+n)8w and w1 =

w/(l+g).

it is possible to

factor out Lti and in w. and write

(4)

W = Lt

1[(1+n) .t1n (1—8) + (1+n)(1—ji) in 0.5 (1—8 + ex)

+ g.z ln(1+n)8 + (1—gi) in 0.5(1—8 + ex)(1+r)(1+g)]

+ L1(2+n) in
Since the terms including 8 are in the square brackets and do not change from

period to period, the value of e that maximizes W is the same as the value
that maximizes total utility in any other period.7 I shall assume that the
government wishes to choose 8 to maximize this total utility.8

7Except for the initial period when the program is started. In that
period, retirees get windfall benefits that they never paid for. This is
discussed in Feidstein (1985a, pp. 310—314).
8The government might instead choose 8 to maximize the discounted value of
utility in all years including the initial period. Ignoring the initial
period is equivalent to assuming that the discount rate that the government
applies in aggregating utilities is relatively low so that the initial period

The qualitative implications of this condition are easily established by
totally differentiating equation 5. It is easily shown in this way that

d9*/d > 0, dO*/dx > 0 and dO*/dn < 0.

Before interpreting these it is useful

to derive also the effects of the parameters on the optimal value of the per
u*

worker benefits. Since bt =

e*(i+n)w,

it follows immediately that db /di > 0

u*

and db /dx > 0.

The sign of db /dn is ambiguous and depends on the value of

the other parameters.

It is easy to interpret these properties. Since an increase in the
fraction of myopes increases the number of individuals who gain from a higher
level of the universal benefit and decreases the number who lose, it raises
the optimal benefit level (db*/diA >
rate (d8*/dgi >

0).

0) and therefore the corresponding tax

An increase in the relative efficiency of social security

in comparison to real investment, i.e., a rise in the ratio of the implicit
rate of return on social security to the rate of return on real capital,
reduces the cost to the cyclers of the compulsory social security program and
therefore raises the optimal level of both benefits (db(*/dx >
(d8*/dgi >

0).

0) and taxes

Finally, since an increase in the relative number of workers

gets little weight or that the sum does not converge so that it is only
meaningful to maximize the utility of a representative year. Feldstein
(1985a) develops the discounted value and discusses these issues more
explicitly. If the government's utility discount rate is less than
(1+g)(1+n)-1, the discounted sum of utilities does riotconverge and the
government must maximize the representative value of W.
9The second order condition is satisfied for all feasible parameter
values.

permits a given level of benefits to be achieved with a lower tax rate,
d8*/d(1+n) <

0.

Table 1 presents specific numerical values of 0* and of the resulting
level of welfare1° for a range of values of ii and x. To limit the dimension of
the table, the calculations are done for a single value of n based on U.S.

experience. The value of n represents the rate of labor force growth for a
generation, which I will take to be 30 years. Since the U.S. population
grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent for the three decades beginning
in 1950, I shall take (1+n) = (1.014)30 =

The value of x =

(1+g)(1+n)/(1+r)

during these years to x =

that corresponds to U.S. experience

This reflects the annual labor force growth

of 1.4 percent, an annual rate of growth of real compensation per hour of
2.2 percent and a pretax real rate of return on U.S. nonfinancial corporate

capital of 11.4 percent.11
=

0.115.

Together these imply x =

[(1.014)(1.022)I(1.114)]30

Reducing the population growth rate to zero and the rate of real

compensation growth to 0.32 percent (the average for the most recent decade,
1974—84) cuts the relative efficiency of social security to x =

0.043.

In

contrast, maintaining the values of g and n but cutting the projected real
rate of return in half (from 0.114 to 0.057) raises the relative efficiency of

social security to x =

0.553.

The tabulations in Table 1 are presented for

these three values and for selected values of i between 0.1 and 1.0.

and the term (2+n) mw that does not depend
—1
on e. The values in the tabe are actually [W — (2+n ln

The optimal tax rates shown in column 1 increase with the relative

frequency of myopes. With the historic value of x = 0.115, the optimal tax

rate increase from

0.363 when 90 percent of the population are myopes. In the limiting

0.044 when only 10 percent of the poulation are myopes

case in which everyone is myopic, e =

(2+n)

=

0.396; this corresponds to

the tax rate that distributes income equally between workers and myopes.

Although a lower efficiency of social security reduces the optimal value of
the effect is not very substantial.

1.2 A Means-Tested Social Security Program
If the social security program is means tested and the level of taxes and

benefits is set in a way that causes cyclers to save, benefits are paid only
to retired myopes and the budget constraint linking the tax rate (8) to the
level of means-tested benefits per beneficiary (bm) is

b =

(6)

since

only a fraction

of retirees receives benefits. The behavior of the

myopes is the same under a means-tested program as under the universal

program. They consume their entire disposable income while working
(C1t =

(l—e)w)

and depend exclusively on the benefits to finance consumption

during retirement (C2t+1 =

bt+i).

If the cyclers save, the level of means-tested benefits is irrelevant and

their behavior is affected only by the tax. They maximize u(C1. C2t+i) =

in

+

lnL(1_8)w

—

Ci](1+r)

and therefore choose C =

O.S(1-e)wt

and

C1 = O.5(1—9)w(1+r).
Cyclers will save if the utility that results from this combination of

—12—

is greater than the utility of consuming their entire disposable

income while they are working and relying on the benefits to finance their

consumption. That is, cyciers choose to save if and only if

This maximum tax rate implies a maximum value for the ratio of the benefits
paid to myopes (and therefore their level of retirement consumption) to the

retirement consumption of cyclers. Since

O.S(1—e)w1(1+r). the ratio of benefits to the retirement consumption of

Substituting 8max from equation 10 yields
bt
(12)

=

0.5.

2,t max
Thus the maximum level of benefits consistent with continued saving by the
cyclers is one-half of the level of consumption that the cyclers would obtain

by their optimal saving. While this simple result reflects the particular
loglinear utility, it illustrates how the level of benefits may have to be
constrained significantly in a means—tested program in order to keep cyclers
saving.

The value of 8max increases with the relative number of myopes but less
than proportionately, implying that the maximum benefits in a means—tested

program varies inversely with the number of myopes. The value of e also
varies inversely with x, implying that the maximum tax is reduced as the

benefits produced by any level of tax increases. For example, with x = 0.115,
rises from

= 0.30

at ji

= 0.2

to 8max =

0.52

at ji

= 0.5

and

8max =

0.63 at u = 0.8.

at x =

0.553 to 8max = 0.30 at x = 0.115 and emax = 0.538 at x = 0.043.

Similarly, with i =

0.2,

emax rises from emax = 0.083

If the value 8* that maximizes total utility on the assumption that
cyclers save exceeds emax. the value 8* is irrelevant and the feasible
optimum value for a means-tested program is emax.12

12A means-tested program in which cyclers do not save is, ex post, a
universal program. Such a program is dominated by an ex ante universal
program in which cyclers do some saving.

—14—

The analysis now proceeds by deriving, for different parameter
combinations, the optimal tax value (8*) on the assumption that cyclers save.
If 8*

8max' the total utility is calculated at 8*; if 8* >

8max' total

utility is calculated at 8max These total utility values for a means—tested
program can then be compared to the total utility values for the universal

program to decides whether the means-tested program or the universal program
provides the higher level of total utility.

Total utility at time t under the means-tested program can be written as

the sum of the utilities of the Lt workers and Lt_i retirees as:13

(13)

=

Lt[i

+

Lt1[i

ln(1—8)wt + (1—11) ln O.5(1_e)w]

ln b + (1—n) in O.5(1—8)(1+r)w1).

After substituting b =

J1(1+n)ew and w1 = w/(1+g)

total utility can be

written as

This result is very striking. It implies that the optimal benefit—wage ratio
depends only on the rate of population growth and is independent of the
frequency of myopes in the population and the relative efficiency of social
security and real investment.

This striking conclusion is easily explained. A means—tested social
security program is equivalent to a redistribution of income from all workers

to those retirees who have no private assets. As such, it is a problem in
optimal income redistribution. With no distorting effect of the tax or the
benefit on labor supply or saving,14 the tax should be used to redistribute
income until the marginal utility of a dollar of additional income for the

working generation equals the marginal utility of a dollar to the retired

myopes. The relative efficiency of private saving and social security at
converting present to future income (x) is irrelevant. And while the relative
number of myopes influences the tax rate required to support the benefits, it
does not alter the optimal level of benefits (* is independent of IA).

14The tax reduces the saving of the cyclers by reducing their disposable
income but there is no substitution effect distortion.

Substituting this value of 8* into equation 14 yields an expression for
the optimal level of total utility in an unconstrained means—tested program:

the constraint is binding for gi

0.63, the constraint is always binding. While with x <

0.38,

the

constraint is never binding.
When the constraint -is not binding, total utility for the means tested
program -is always greater than total utility for the universal program.

Although this apparently cannot be shown analytically because the optimal
value of 8 for the universal program -is only defined implicitly by equation 5,

it can be shown by calculating the optimal values of 8u and 8m and the

resulting total utility measure numerically for all conceivable values of t
and x [0

1.0 and 0 <

x

1.0] and for values of n corresponding to

annual population growth rates between zero and three percent (0

n

1.43).

Even when the constraint on the optimal means-tested tax rate is binding
(8* >

8max'

the total utility for the means tested program may still be

—17—

higher than total utility for the universal program. The universal program
provides a higher level of total utility only when the constraint on the level
of benefits given to the myopes in the means-tested program depresses their
utility below what they would get in an optimal universal program by more than
enough to outweigh the greater adverse effects on the cyclers of a universal
program.

Explicit numerical comparison shows that the universal program is optimal
only for high values of x and relatively high values of j.t.

Moreover, the

greater the relative efficiency of social security (i.e., the higher the value
of x), the lower is the relative frequency of myopes in the population at

which the universal program becomes optimal. For example, although the
constraint on e can be binding at x =

0.4,

it is only binding if p >

0.92

even then it is never optimal to use a universal program.15 When x =

and,

0.6,

the

constraint on e is binding for p as low as 0.12 but the universal program is

only optimal at values of p greater than 0.22. Figure 1 shows the
combinations of x and p values at which the universal program is optimal (the
upper triangle) and the wider set of x and p values at which the constraint on
e is binding but the means-tested program remains optimal (including the upper

triangle and t e area between the two lines). The area at the bottom shows
the range of x and p values for which the constraint is not binding and the
means—tested program is optimal.

Note that with the historic measure of social security efficiency

15This calculation assumes the historic rate of population growth of 1.4
percent a year.

—18-

(x =

0.115),

the universal program is never optimal. This conclusion remains

true for all rates of population growth. For the combinations of

ji

and x

reported in Table 1, the universal program is optimal only for x = 0.553 and
=

0.9.

Recall that x = 0.553 corresponds to cutting the real rate of return

on capital in half. But even with this extreme assumption, the universal
program is optimal only if myopes constitute nearly all of the population.
This conclusion about the general dominance of the means—tested program

depends of course on the simplified characterization of the population as
either pure cyclers or pure myopes. In the richer model of the next section,
there is more scope for a universal program to dominate.

2. The Optimal Program When Benefits Distort Saving
A social security program that pays means-tested benefits to only a
fraction of retirees cannot distort saving in an economy with only two types

of individuals. With only two types of individuals, the level of taxes and
benefits can be set in a way that achieves perfect separation between myopes

and cyclers. Nyopes save nothing and depend on benefits while cyclers save
in a way that is influenced by the level of potential benefits. Under these
circumstances, a means-tested program will be optimal unless achieving
separation requires a substantial restraint on the level of benefits.

In an economy with more than two types of individuals, a separation that
does not distort saving is not always a characteristic of an optimal

means-tested program. The analysis in this section shows that the optimal
level of means-tested benefits may cause some individuals who are neither

completely myopic nor perfectly rational life-cycle utility maximizers to stop

—19-

saving and rely exclusively on social security benefits. For these
individuals, the reduction in saving is greater than it would be with a

universal program. If they are sufficiently important in the population, the
total utility of a means-tested program may be lower than the total utility

of a universal program. The current analysis examines the characterization
of the economy and of the population that influences this choice.
The analysis of the previous section can be extended to deal with this

more general case by intoducing a third class of individuals who are
partially myopic, that is, who give too little weight to their future utility

when they make savings decisions during their working years. More
specifically, I will assume that a fraction TI of the population acts during

their working years to maximize inC1 +

even though their

In Pigou's (

) words,

these partial myopes have a "faulty telescopic faculty" that causes them to
give too little weight to future utility.
As before, it is useful to begin by analyzing the effects of a universal

social security program and calculating the total utility level that results

from an optimal universal program. The optimal means-tested program can then
be derived and the resulting total utility level compared with that of the
universal program.

2.1 An Optimal Universal Social Security ProQram
The budget constraint of a universal social security program is the same
in the current three-class economy as it was in the simple economy of the
previous section:

—20-

(18)

e(1+r).
The fundamental difference between the previous section and the current

one lies in the behavior of the partial myopes. The partial myopes choose
their first period consumption by maximizing in C1. + A in C21 subject to
the personal budget constraint

C21 = [(l_8)wt_Cit](11r)

+

bt+1.

This

implies first period consumption of

C = (1+A)'[(1_e)w

(19)

+

bi/(1+r)]

Using the government budget constraint (18) to eliminate bt and recalling
that x =

(li-g)(1+n)/(1+r)

measures the efficiency of social security, the

first-period consumption of the partial myopes can be written:

(20)

=

(1+A)[1—e

Their consumption during retirement can be written:

(21)

Although the partial myopes choose their consumption levels by
maximizing in C1. + A in

the proper social valuation of the total

utility of the consumption of the partial myopes living at time t is

liLt in C+ II Lt_j in C where II is the fraction of partial myopes in the
population. The consumption behavior and utility level of the pure myopes
and the pure cyclers is the same as in the previous section. Total utility
at time t with the universal social security program can therefore be written

When there are no partial myopes (fl=O)., equation 24 is equivalent to equation 4

of the previous section.

Consider now the value of e that maximizes totai utility with this

universal program. Since the terms in equation 24 that include e do not
involve either II or A, it follows immediately that the optimal value of e is

—22-

independent of the relative number of partial myopes or of their degree of

myopia. It can be verified directly by differentiating W with respect to e
that the optimal tax rate in the universal program satisfies

This is exactly the same as the optimum condition of equation 5 for an
economy with no partial-myopes.16
The values of 8* corresponding to different values of

and x that are

presented in Table 1 can therefore be used to evaluate the total utility level

given by equation 24. These maximum values for the total utility achievable
with an optimal universal social security program can then be compared with
the corresponding maximum values that can be attained with a means—tested

program. Before presenting the total utility levels implied by equation 24,
it is therefore useful to analyze the means-tested program.

2.2 A Means-Tested Program With Partial Myopes
A universal program of social security benefits reduces the saving of
all individuals who save to finance future consumption, including both pure

life—cyclers and partial myopes.17 In contrast, a means-tested program reduces
saving only if it induces individuals to cut their saving in order to qualify

16This simplifying property is a result of the loglinear nature of the
utility function. It follows directly from equations 20 and 21 that changes
in 8 alter utility in a way that does not depend on the value of A. The
effect of B on utility is therefore the same for partial—myopes and for pure
life—cyclers. Therefore only the relative number of pure myopes is relevant
to determining the optimal value of 0.
17This is in addition to the reduction in saving caused by the reduction
in disposable income that results from the tax. The discussion in the
remainder of the paragraph also ignores this tax effect and focuses on the
substitution of benefits for private wealth accumulation.

—23—

for the means—tested benefit. In order to analyze this possibility, I will
assume that benefits are provided only to individuals who do not save at

all.18 Interest then focuses on the possibility that the partial—myopes
choose to stop saving and rely only on the benefits to finance retirement

consumption. Since the level of benefits that induces such substitution may
not be high enough to induce full life cyclers to stop saving, the result may

be a means—tested program in which only some retirees receive benefits but in
which a substantial number of people substitute social security benefits for
private saving.

The analysis that follows shows that the means—tested program may be

preferred to a universal program even when partial myopes are induced to
become nonsavers. A means-tested program is preferable to a universal

program under a wide range of parameter values. But the possibility of
inducing partial myopes to become nonsavers does increase the range of

economic parameter values in which a universal program is preferred to a

means-tested program. The implications of this are discussed more fully in
the concluding section of the paper. But first the formal -results must be
derived and analyzed.

In the simpler case in which individuals are either pure myopes or pure

cyclers, I derived the maximum value of B that was consistent with continued

saving by the cyclers. In the current context, two separate sets of
conditions must be derived in order to evalute total utility. In the first
case, the value of B is such that both the cyclers and the partial—myopes

181f the means-tested program provided full benefits to partial-myopes,
there would be no basis for analyzing the substitution of benefits for
private saving. A more complex means—tested program that provided partial
benefits to individuals with private assets but with less than a 100 percent
effective tax rate would be worth analyzing.

—24-

continue to save. In the second case, the value of e is such that only the
cyclers continue to save and the partial myopes are induced to substitute

benefits for private wealth accumulation. For each set of parameter values
(jl,

x,

n, A and 11), both cases must be evaluated separately and the

corresponding values of total utility calculated. The higher utility value
indicates the optimum means-tested program. This total utility value can
then be compared with the value of the corresponding universal program.
Consider first the conditions under which both cyclers and partial

myopes save. Cyclers choose to save if and only if the utility that results
from saving exceeds the utility of consuming all disposable income and

relying on benefits to finance retirement consumption. This condition is
exactly the same as equation 7 of section 1:

(26)

in

in O.5(]._e)w +

ln(1_e)w

+

o.5(1_e)w(1+r) >

in bt+i.

Since in this case benefits are paid only to myopes, the government's budget
constraint implies bt =

(27)

1e(1+n)w

and cyclers save if

in O.5(1_e)w + in O.5(1—O)wt(1+r) >

ln(1_e)w

+

in

st 1e(1+n)(1+g)w.

Solving this implies that cyclers will save oniy if e is less than

(28)

max

I1+4x

just as in the previous section. This maximum value of 8 is denoted 8ax to
emphasize that it is the highest value of 8 consistent with saving by the
cyclers.

—25—

The maximum value of 9 that is consistent with continued saving by the

partial myopes can be derived in a similar way. Partial myopes save only if
the resulting lifetime utility (as they perceive it, with weight A given to
second period utility) exceeds the liftime utility that results if all

disposable income is consumed. If the partial myopes do reject the benefits
and save, their consumption is chosen to maximize in C1 + A
subject to

=

((1_e)wt_C1)(1+r).

This implies C1 =

ln C21

(1)(1)wt

and therefore that the perceived lifetime utility is ln (1+Ai'(1_9)w +
A

ln(1_(1+A))(1_9)w(1+r). The partial myopes therefore save if and only

if

(29)

ln(1+A)(1_e)wt +

A In (A/(1+A))(1_e)w(1+r) >

in(1-9)w

+ A in bti.

Note again that, with partial myopes saving, benefits are paid only to pure

myopes and therefore bt =

M1e(1+n)w.

Substituting for bt+i and factoring

out w yields:

(30)

in (].+A)1(1—9) + A in(A/(1+A))(1—8) > ln(1—9) + A in

6x.

Rearranging terms and solving implies the important condition that
partial myopes save19 if and only if 9 is less than

(31)

where the superscript A on

9 consistent with continued saving by partial myopes.2° Differentiating this

19Th-is is conditional on saving by pure cyclers as well. As I note below,
pure cyciers always save if it is optimal for partial myopes to save.

2O is easy to see (and perhaps reassuring) that with A=1 this is
equivalent to the value of 8max for pure cyclers presented in equation 28.

expression with respect to A shows that 8max rises monotonically with A for
0 < A

1. This means that 8 <

max

implies

8 <

max

; if

the value of 9 is

low enough to keep partial—myopes saving, it is also low enough to keep
cyclers saving.

Before looking at the second case in which partial-myopes do not save,
it is interesting to see the way in which the presence of partial myopes

reduces the maximum value of 8 (and the corresponding value of benefits) that

is consistent with leaving saving unchanged.21 For example, with the value of
x =

0.115 corresponding to U.S. experience of the past three decades, the

= 0.30
maximum tax rate consistent with unchanged saving drops from 8c
max
= 0.11 when partial myopes have A =0.5 and to only
when ji = 0.2 to eA

9max =

0.06 when partial myopes have A = 0.2.

The relative reductions are

only slightly smaller when the fraction of myopes is larger. For example,
when half of the population are myopes (gi
to

max

=

= 0.5), 8ax = 0.52

0.39 when partial myopes have A = 0.5 and 8A

max

=

but declines

0.23 when A = 0.2.

Thus the maximum value of 9 consistent with unchanged saving drops
substantially when

there

are partial myopes whose initial level of saving is

relatively low.

I turn therefore to the second case in which the level of 8 is high

enough to cause partial-myopes not to save but not so high that cyclers cease

saving. The values of e that define this range are not the values of eax
and

max that have just been derived because they were derived using the

government constraint that holds when only the pure myopes are nonsavers.

2LJnchanged saving refers to no substitution of benefits for private
saving. The tax per se will always alter saving.

—27-

Since the current case corresponds to providing benefits to partial myopes as
well as pure myopes, the government budget constraint becomes bt =
It then follows directly that the values of e that define the

corresponds to the first or second case. Consider first the total utility

This is exactly analogous to the previously derived optimum tax rates for
programs except that p+IT now replaces gi because partial myopes behave like

pure myopes.

This optimal value of 9* will be consistent with the limits of equation

The second of these inequalities is satisfied for the historic values of n =

0.52 and x = 0.115

for all possible values of p+TI.

The first inequality is

satisfied for low values of A but not for high values. More precisely, with
the historic values, the first inequality is satisfied for A < 0.13 but is
never satisfied for A

0.23. Thus the double inequality that defines this case

in which partial myopes do not save at the optimal 9* is satisfied only f or a
rather narrow range of very low values of A if x and n take their historic

values. But with a higher value of x, the range of A values consistent with
nonsaving by the partial myopes is much broader. For example, with x = 0.553
(and n Continuing at 0.52), the first of the inequalities is satisfied for

—31—

values ranging to more than A =
values between A = 0 and A =
0.5 even at ji+fl =

for 0 < A

0.8.

0.6

The double inequality is satisfied by

for very low values of i+fl but is satisfied

0.5.

Finally, it is possible that the value of 8 derived on the assumption
that only cyclers save will in fact cause even cyclers to want to stop saving.

Since this limit on 8 is given by equation 32 and the optimal value of 8 is

given by 42, we see that the constraint on 8 will be binding only if
(45)

2+n

2+n

Although this can never be binding for the historic values of x = 0.115 and
n =

0.52,

the constraint could be binding if social security were more

efficient. When x =

0.5,

the constraint is binding if gi+fl >

n.

So even low

values of i and fl could then make it necessary to constrain 8 = (z+fl)/(J2+fl+4x)
instead of allowing it to take its unconstrained maximum value.

To summarize, there are three possible values of 8* and the corresponding
total utility values that must be examined in assessing the means—tested

program. In the first case, only myopes do not save, 8* = M/(2+n) and the
total utility is obtained by substituting this value into equation 36. In the
second case, both the myopes and the partial myopes do not save, e* =

(ii-fl)/(2+n)

and total utility is obtained by substituting the value into

equation 41. Finally, if both myopes and partial myopes do not save and 8
must be set equal to the maximum value consistent with saving by the cyclers

-329 =

(ji+fl)(i+fl+4x),

the total utility is obtained by substituting this value

'into equation 41.

to a relatively much more efficient social security program (x = 0.553 and

For each set of parameter values, the table shows six things. Columns 1

and 2 show the optimal tax rate for a universal program 9u* and the resulting
level of total welfare23 (W). The same two statistics are presented for
means tested programs in columns 3 and 4. An asterisk next to the higher
utility value indicates the type of program that is optimal. Column 5
indicates for the means-tested programs whether the partial myopes save. The
final column indicates whether the tax rate in the means-tested program had to
be limited to assure that the cyclers continue to save.

Over a wide range of parameter values, a means-tested program is

preferable to any universal program. With the historical values of social
security efficiency (x =

0.115)

and population growth (ii =

0.52),

partial myopes give even as little weight to future utility as A =

optimal means tested program would cause partial myopes to stop saving. This
is not a sufficient condition to make a universal program optimal but, if the
partial myopes are frequent enough in the population, it does become important
enough to outweigh the adverse effects of a universal program on the pure
cyclers. Thus the universal program dominates when gi =

= 0.1

and II =

0.5

and similarly when g.t

= 0.2

and II =

0.1

and II =

0.2,

or gi

0.5.

Two things should be noted about these three combinations. First, it
follows from the structure of the problem that if the universal program is
optimal for gi

= o.i,

fl =

0.2

and for ji

= 0.1

program is also optimal for all values of U

and fl =

0.5,

0.2 if gi

since the means tested program is preferable at gi

= 0.1

then the universal

= 0.1.
and II =

Note also that

0.1,

there is

some value of II between 0.1 and 0.2 at which the universal program becomes

optimal. Thus, for low enough A and ji,

the

universal program is optimal as

long as at least a modest fraction of the population are partial myopes.
Second, at ji

= 0.2

the universal program is not optimal at II =

becomes optimal at some value of 0.2 < U <

0.5.

0.2

but

When there are more myopes,

the optimal means-tested program becomes relatively more expensive and thus
keeps the universal program optimal until the distortion of saving by the
partial myopes becomes a more important problem, i.e., until U reaches a

higher level. For the same reason, when gi
optimal at fl =

0.2

= 0.5

and remains optimal until U

the mean-tested program is
0.

When myopes put a higher value on future utility (A =

0.2 and A = 0.5),

the partial myopes continue to save with the uncontrained optimal means-tested

program. Under these conditions, the means-tested program dominates the
universal program.

-34-

When social security is more efficient relative to private saving, two

things hapen. First, under an optimal means-tested program, the partial
myopes will in general choose to stop saving and depend on the social security

benefits. Note that, with x =

0.553, the partial myopes do not save at any of

the parameter combinations. Second, although the means—tested program causes
partial myopes to stop saving, the result is a smaller welfare loss when

social security is relatively efficient. As a result, the means-tested
program remains preferable at moderate values of A.
As A rises, the reduction in the saving of partial myopes caused by a

0.5

means—tested program becomes large. In addition, with a high value of A =
and with ri =

05,

it is necessary to constrain the means-tested tax rate to

avoid causing the cyclers to stop saving as well. In these cases, where
<

8*

for the means-tested program, the universal program is optimal.

The optimal tax rates in columns 1 and 3 show that an optimal
means—tested program is not in general smaller than an optimal universal

program.

*
Since the tax base is the same for both types of programs, 8m >

implies

that total taxes and therefore total benefits are higher under the

means—tested program. With the historic value of x =

0.115,

*

the optimal

means—tested program is larger than the corresponding universal program with
low values of A (because it is then optimal to induce the partial myopes to
stop saving) but is smaller than the universal program when A is not very low.

With a higher value of x =

0.553, the relative size of the universal and

means—tested programs depends on the values of fl and gi and no simple

generalization is possible. It cannot be said that a means-tested program is
better because it is smaller, although table 2 indicates that, whenever the

—35—

universal program is preferable, it is also smaller than the corresponding
optimal means-tested program.
3.

A Concluding Comment
The analysis of this paper shows that a means-tested social security

program may be preferable to a universal program under a wide range of

economic conditions. But the analysis also shows that the optimal type of
program and the optimal level of benefits in a universal program depend on the

of

fl and A, an increase in the relative frequency of myopes raises the optimal

tax in the means-tested program. Similarly, if the means—tested program is
optimal but causes partial myopes to stop saving, the optimal tax rate
increases with the combined frequency of myopes and partial myopes.

This suggests that overall welfare can be increased if the working
population as a whole can be divided into two subgroups with a different type

of program provided to each group. Note that this does not require that the
subgroups be homogeneous --

all

cyclers or all myopes --

but

only that the

groups have different mixes of myopes, partial myopes and cyclers. Moreover,
although it would obviously be best to know the characteristics of each

subgroup with precision, a welfare improvement could be achieved even with
imperfect information.

An obvious criteria for grouping individuals is income. Low income
individuals are more likely to be myopes or to be partial myopes who give low

weight to future consumption. If so, the low income group might be an
appropriate candidate for a universal program.
All of the analysis in this paper has reflected the fact that the utility

-36-

characteristics that influence the saving behavior of each individual are

unobservable. it is possible, however, to observe saving. An individual who
saves, especially in the form of a pension or special retirement account, is

certainly not a myope in the sense of this paper. The analysis presented here
implies that any individual who demonstrates sufficient saving should be

eligible for a means—tested program even if a universal program would be
optimal for that individual's population subgroup.

Finally, it should be noted that, within the population for whom a
means—tested program is optimal, there is no way to increase efficiency by
varying the program among subgroups (unless the means-tested benefits would

cause cyclers to become nonsavers). To see this, note that the optimal level
of means-tested benefits does not depend on the values of A, j.t,

or

11; the

optimal tax rate varies only because differences in .& (and in II if partial

myopes stop saving) changes the tax rate required to finance a given level of

benefits. To see this, recall that 9* = gi/(2+n) for the means-tested program
if partial myopes save (equation 37) and 9* =

(gi+fl)/(2+n) if only cyclers save

(equation 42). But benefits per retiree are bt = (M+n) 1(1+n)ew if only
cyclers save. The benefit to wage ratio is therefore always
bt/wt =

(1+n)/(2+n).

Creating separate subgroups would not cause the optimal

benefit/wage ratio to vary among subgroups. Since redistributing the tax
burden would not provide any overall welfare change, there is no gain from
disaggregation within the means—tested population.
