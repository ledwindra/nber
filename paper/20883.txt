Pareto Efficiency and Identity

ABSTRACT
Inherent in the definition of Pareto efficiency is the idea that, in dynamic environments, an individual
is indexed by the history of events up to his birth (rather than, as usual, the date of birth). Here, we
explore the implications of this natural formulation. The set of Pareto efficient allocations that is consistent
with this view is potentially larger than those considered so far in the literature. We show that the set
of allocations is strictly larger because we do not require individuals to have insurance motives of
the Harsanyi-Rawls type regarding risks on their own type realization. We do, however, maintain the
insurance motives of parents toward their children. Even in our more general framework, efficiency
criteria impose substantial restrictions on the set of allocations. Interestingly, the restrictions are of
a new nature. Our different, more natural view has some important policy implications. The first is
that some policy criteria (for example, the progressive nature of taxes) cannot be defended on efficiency
grounds, once the Harsanyi-Rawlsian insurance criterion is rejected as being normatively unsound.
Second, we show that the condition of imposing no taxes of any kind, coupled with each agent owning
his own production, results in a Pareto efficient allocation.

1. Introduction
Inherent in the definition of Pareto efficiency is the idea that individuals have preference
orderings over allocations. If allocation A is Pareto dominated by allocation B, it is because all
individuals weakly prefer allocation B to allocation A and at least one individual strictly prefers
allocation B to allocation A. Further, although it may be possible for two individuals to have the
same preference ordering, it is not possible for one individual to have two preference orderings. The
individual’s preferences over allocations are what they are.
These obvious statements have an important implication. In this paper, we argue that the
requirement that a person have a unique preference ordering implies that in dynamic economies,
individuals born after the beginning of time must be indexed by the history that preceded their
births. That is, an individual born after one history is a different person (for the purposes of Pareto
comparisons across allocations) than an individual born at the same date but after a different
history. We then consider the implications of such a Pareto criterion on a repeated Mirrlees (1971,
1976) economy similar to that of Farhi-Werning (2007), where each period represents a lifetime for
an agent, but such an agent cares about the utility of his descendants. Here we show that the
set of Pareto efficient allocations that is consistent with this view is potentially larger than those
considered so far in the literature. In fact, we show that they are strictly larger, because we do not
restrict individuals to having insurance motives of the Harsanii-Rawls type against risks on their
own type realization and the realizations of their ancestors. We do, however, maintain insurance
motives of parents toward their children.
Even in our more general framework, efficiency criteria impose substantial restrictions on the
set of allocations. Interestingly, the restrictions are of a new nature. Our different, more natural
view has some important policy implications. The first is that some policy criteria (for example, the
progressive nature of taxes) cannot be defended on efficiency grounds, once the Harsanyi-Rawlsian

insurance criterion is rejected as normatively unsound. Second, we show that imposing no taxes of
any kind, coupled with each agent owning his own production, results in a Pareto efficient allocation.

2. Individuals as Histories
To illustrate the main idea, that individuals must be indexed by the history that preceded
their births, we begin with a simple economy in which one father in the first period has one son in
the second. The father knows his own economically relevant type (for example, his own skill), but
in the first period, he does not know the type of his son, who may have high or low skill. The father
cares about the happiness of the son. Upon his birth, the son knows his own type, immediately and
completely, and he is able to make all relevant decisions accordingly. In this model, the father has
an insurance motive: when he makes the relevant decisions, he has true uncertainty about the type
of the son, and since the son’s happiness affects his, he may want to insure against this risk. For
the son, the situation is different: at the moment in which he makes choices, he knows his type. Ex
ante, in this economy there are three persons, and three persons are relevant for efficiency analysis;
one person (the father) has true uncertainty and two persons (each of his potential sons) have not.
We may ask the realization of the son to go back in time, before his birth, and tell us his
order over allocations from this behind the veil point of view. If we impose some utility function
on him (for example, expected utility, as in Harsanyi (1955), or mini-max, as in Rawls (1971)), he
will give us answers, and in this hypothetical choice he would have reasons for insurance. That
is, we might impute to him an insurance motive of the Harsanyi-Rawls type. By doing so, note
that we are introducing and making relevant preferences that, in our simple model, are not held by
any individual at any point in time. Using the real preferences of the father and the hypothetical
preferences we have described, we would then be able to select allocations that are efficient in this
two-person economy. These allocations are typically efficient in our three potential persons economy;
they may be obtained by restricting the Pareto weights to depend only on the date of birth of the
2

son. They are not, however, all of the Pareto efficient allocations. By introducing the HarsanyiRawls thought experiment, we have arbitrarily restricted the set of efficient allocations. If we find
properties that all such allocations share, we cannot legitimately conclude that these properties are
shared by all efficient allocations.
This model is a simplification, even in some crucial aspects, which we have made explicit.
We will hold similar simplified assumptions in the first part of the paper, which considers a repeated
Mirrlees type environment, and then we will consider extensions. One very important restriction is
that the son knows his type immediately, completely, and at the moment in which he is able to make
competent decisions. This assumption allows for an unambiguous discussion about the son and his
preference ordering. Reality, however, is more complex: types are revealed progressively during the
lifetime; for example, the son may know his gender at birth, know his IQ at 12 years of age, and
be able to make competent decisions at 18. We consider these complexities later in the paper (see
section 6.), and discuss how much, if at all, they change our conclusions.
In our simple illustration, the set of all Pareto efficient allocations can be found if we insist
that, as mentioned earlier, individuals born after the beginning of time must be indexed by the
history that preceded their births. To further illustrate the implications of this criterion, including
the idea that entire histories must be included and not just an individual’s own type at birth, consider
the following single consumption good endowment economy. At the beginning of date t = 1, two
individuals with names i ∈ {1, 2} are born — one with a high endowment and one with a low
endowment. Let the aggregate state θ1 ∈ {θ1 , θ2 } be determined after these date t = 1 agents are
born and denote which agent has a high endowment. Each t = 1 individual consumes ci,1 (θ1 ) of the
consumption good and then dies. At the beginning of date t = 2, two more individuals with names
j ∈ {1, 2} are born, and then state θ2 ∈ Θ2 is realized and each individual consumes cj,2 (θ1 , θ2 )
of the consumption good and then dies. Thus, an allocation is a vector (ci,1 (θ1 ), cj,2 (θ1 , θ2 )) with

3

2(2 + 2N (Θ2 )) elements, where N (Θ2 ) is the number of elements of Θ2 .
1
B
1
A
2
Next, consider two allocations A and B such that cA
1,2 (θ , θ2 ) > c1,2 (θ , θ2 ) and c1,2 (θ , θ2 ) <
2
cB
1,2 (θ , θ2 ) for all θ2 . That is, person j = 1 born at date t = 2 receives more consumption for each θ2

realization under allocation A than B if θ1 = θ1 and more consumption for each θ2 under allocation
B than A if θ1 = θ2 . (The idea here is that allocations A and B are such that person j = 1 at
date t = 2 consumes more regardless of the state at date t = 2 if his “father,” the person with the
same name at date t = 1, has a high endowment than if his father has a low endowment.) If at
date t = 2 person j = 1 is selfish (certainly an allowable preference ordering), then how he ranks
allocations A and B depends on the realization of θ1 . But if our concept of an individual requires
a single preference ordering over allocations, then person j = 1 born at date t = 2 after realization
θ1 = θ1 is a different person than person j = 1 born at date t = 2 after realization θ1 = θ2 , for he
ranks allocations differently. One cannot make Pareto comparisons between allocations A and B
without indexing date t = 2 agents by θ1 . In this example, where θ1 can take on two values, there
are six individuals (persons 1 and 2 at date t = 1 and persons 1 and 2 at date t = 2 for each value
of θ1 ).
But what if we change this example so that each person i at date t = 1 lives for two periods,
and persons j at t = 2 are never born? In this second environment, an allocation is exactly the same
object as in the previous environment — a vector (ci,1 (θ1 ), cj,2 (θ1 , θ2 )). However, most standard
analysis would define Pareto efficiency relative to only two preference orderings: those of persons 1
and 2 at the beginning of date t = 1. But the other four preference orderings (those of each person
for each realization of θ1 at the beginning of date t = 2) still exist. To compare allocations under the
Pareto criterion taking into account only the first two preference orderings (those of persons 1 and 2
at the beginning of date t = 1) is to ignore these other four people. For most cases, we believe this
approach is correct. For instance, when an economist argues that outlawing insurance is inefficient,

4

he or she is ignoring the preference ordering of those individuals whose houses did not burn down
and would prefer not to pay to rebuild the houses that did. But when these “ex post” individuals
are actually separate human beings and not simply the future self of a pre-existing human, it is no
longer clear to us that their preference orderings should be ignored.
A more specific example may be useful. Let the preferences of person i born at date t = 1
be represented by
X



π(θ1 )π(θ2 ) u(ci,1 (θ1 )) + u(ci,2 (θ1 , θ2 ))

(1)

θ1 ,θ2

and the preferences of person i born at date t = 2 after history θ1 be represented by
X

π(θ2 )u(ci,2 (θ1 , θ2 )).

(2)

θ2

Such an example represents a world in which a parent cares about the consumption of his child
(but the children care only for themselves). Or, if individuals live for two periods, equation (1)
represents person i’s preferences at the beginning of date t = 1 and equation (2) represents person
i’s preferences at the beginning of period t = 2 after history θ1 .
At date t = 1, let θ1 ∈ Θ1 = {θ1 , θ2 } be revealed. At date t = 2, let Θ2 = {θ2 } (a singleton)
denoting that all uncertainty is revealed at date t = 1. If θ1 = θ1 , person 1 has an endowment of
three in date t = 1 and an endowment of one in date t = 2, and person 2 has an endowment of one
in date t = 1 and an endowment of three in date t = 2. If θ1 = θ2 , person 1 has an endowment
of one in date t = 1 and an endowment of three in date t = 2, and person 2 has an endowment of
three in date t = 1 and an endowment of one in date t = 2.
Consider two allocations. In allocation A (autarky), c1,1 (θ1 ) = 3, c1,2 (θ1 ) = 1, c1,1 (θ2 ) = 1,
c1,2 (θ2 ) = 3, c2,1 (θ1 ) = 1, c2,2 (θ1 ) = 3, c2,1 (θ2 ) = 3, and c2,2 (θ2 ) = 1. Let allocation B (borrowing
and lending) have ci,t (θ1 ) = 2 for i ∈ {1, 2}, t ∈ {1, 2}, and θ1 ∈ {θ1 , θ2 }. Assuming standard
assumptions on u and no societal ability to transfer the consumption good across periods, this is
the equilibrium outcome when individuals can borrow and lend.
5

In this example, allocation B is strictly preferred to allocation A by both individuals born
at date t = 1. But allocation A is strictly preferred to allocation B from the perspective of person
2 at date t = 2 after history θ1 = θ1 as well as by person 1 at date t = 2 after history θ1 = θ2 .
If these date t = 2 people are interpreted as simply the future selves of those born at date t = 1,
then this reversal simply expresses the desire to not repay a loan. But if these date t = 2 people are
interpreted as new individuals, then this reversal expresses the desire to not repay a loan taken out
by someone else.
In both Phelan (2006) and Farhi and Werning (2007, 2010), Pareto efficiency is examined from
another perspective as well. Applied to this example economy, both papers consider the rankings
of individuals born in period t = 1 as well as mythical individuals who, in essence, exist from the
beginning of time but know they will be born at date t = 2. Thus, they do not know the state θ1
and therefore rank allocations according to
X

π(θ1 )π(θ2 )u(ci,2 (θ1 , θ2 )).

(3)

θ1 ,θ2

Like those born at date t = 1, allocation B is strictly preferred over allocation A by an individual
with a preference ordering represented by (3).
One implication of considering the ranking of such a mythical individual is that any allocation
that is Pareto efficient in relation to individuals with rankings represented by equations (1) and (3)
is also Pareto efficient in relation to individuals with rankings represented by equations (1) and (2).
(If for a given allocation, an alternative allocation is weakly worse for all i and θ1 under criterion
(2), then it is weakly worse given criterion (3) since (3) is an average of (2) over realizations θ1 .)
However, allocations that are Pareto efficient in relation to individuals with rankings represented
by equations (1) and (2) are not necessarily Pareto efficient in relation to individuals represented by
rankings (1) and (3). In the preceding example, allocation B is preferred to allocation A by these
“pre-existing” individuals with a ranking represented by (3). Thus, if only allocations A and B are
6

feasible, only allocation B is Pareto efficient if preference orderings (1) and (3) are the only ones
considered. But allocation A is Pareto efficient as well if preference ordering (2) is considered for
all θ1 .
It is now time to proceed with a formal analysis.

3. The Model
Consider a repeated Mirrlees economy with T + 1 dates (generations), t ∈ {0, 1, . . . , T } where
at each date t, there exists a unit continuum of agents with family names i ∈ [0, 1]. At each date
t, each agent i has a type θi,t ∈ Θ, where Θ is a finite set of positive real numbers. For a type θ
agent to produce y ≥ 0 units of the single consumption good, he must exert

y
θ

units of labor effort.

Agents live for one period, but an agent from family i at each date t < T (a father) is associated
with a single agent from family i at date t + 1 (his son). Thus, associated with each agent from
family i at date t is the history of shocks of his dynasty, θit = {θi,0 , . . . , θi,t }. Let π(θ|θ− ) denote
the probability that a type θ− father has a type θ son. The transition matrix π is such that for all
θ ∈ Θ, f (θ) =

P

θ−

π(θ|θ− )f (θ− ), so the fraction of agents of each type is constant over time, and

such that for all (θ, θ− ), π(θ|θ− ) > 0, which ensures that all future θ paths are possible given past
realizations.
−1
An allocation is a collection {{ci,t (θt ), yi,t (θt )}Tt=0
}i∈[0,1] . A symmetric allocation is an allo-

cation such that for all (i, j), t and θit = θjt , ci,t (θit ) = cj,t (θjt ) and yi,t (θit ) = yj,t (θjt ), and thus is
−1
denoted {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0
. Let θs,t = {θs , . . . , θt } denote a family’s realized types between dates s

and t. Symmetric allocations are feasible if

R

(4)

t=0 θ

where R > 1. From here on, we consider only symmetric allocations.
Agents have identical preferences over the consumption-labor pairs of themselves and their

7

descendants. We assume an agent born at date t with family history θt ranks allocations according
to
Ut (θt ) ≡ u(ct (θt )) − h(

)],

(5)

where u is assumed differentiable, strictly increasing, strictly concave, and with limc→0 u0 (c) =
∞, and h(`) = `ψ for some ψ > 1. That h takes this functional form ensures that the utility
possibilities set is convex when θ realizations are private information. This ranking also assumes
restrictions regarding altruism toward descendants. In particular, we assume that a father cares
about the expectation of the discounted dynastic utility of his son, where β ∈ (0, 1). Exponential
discounting ensures time consistency regarding the preferences of a father toward his grandchild and
the preferences of his son toward that grandchild. This assumption is restrictive and important for
some efficiency results detailed later in this paper.
The type realization θt of an agent born at date t to family i is alternatively assumed to be
publicly observed (the full information case) or privately observed by that agent (the private information case). In both cases, all other objects, such as an agent’s consumption, c, and production,
y, are assumed publicly observed with one exception: in the case of private information, an agent’s
labor effort, yθ , is also assumed to be privately observed by that agent. (Otherwise, one could infer
an agent’s θ type from his labor effort and output.)
In the full information case, a symmetric allocation {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0 specifies consumption
and required output levels as functions of the date and a family’s realized type outcomes. In the private information case, an allocation is understood to specify consumption and required output levels
as functions of the date, and the family’s announcements of type outcomes, where the announcement
of θt is made by the family member living at date t.

8

In the case of private information, an allocation is considered incentive compatible if for all
t, θt , and θ̂ 6= θt ,
Ut (θt ) ≥ u(ct (θt−1 , θ̂)) − h(

In words, this condition requires that an agent born at date t to a family with history θt weakly
prefers to announce his true type given that his descendants will truthfully announce their true
types.
Let the full information symmetric utility possibilities set be the set of collections {{Ut (θt )}θt ∈Θt }Tt=0
that can be generated by an allocation satisfying the resource condition (4). Let the private information utility possibilities set be such collections that also satisfy the incentive condition (6). A
symmetric allocation is considered Pareto efficient if no other feasible symmetric allocation generates
a profile {{Ut (θt )}θt ∈Θt }Tt=0 that weakly dominates it and strictly dominates it for at least one t and
θt . Likewise, a symmetric allocation is considered constrained Pareto efficient if no other feasible
and incentive compatible symmetric allocation generates a dominating utility profile.
Lemma 1. The full information and private information utility possibilities sets are each convex.
t

Proof. Define ut (θt ) ≡ u(ct (θt )) and ht (θt ) ≡ ( ytθ(θt ) )ψ . Then a symmetric allocation can be considered a specification {ut (θt ), ht (θt )}Tt=0 . The utility of each type Ut (θt ) is then a linear function of
the allocation. The incentive condition becomes for all t, θt , and θ̂ 6= θt ,
Ut (θt ) ≥ ut (θt−1 , θ̂) − (

which is a linear function of the allocation. Finally, the resource constraint becomes

subject to ct (θt ) and yt (θt ) non-negative for all t and θt , resource feasibility (4), and, for the case
of private information, incentive compatibility (6). The principal difference between our approach
and that in Phelan (2006) or Farhi-Werning (2007, 2010) is that here γt (θt ) is allowed to depend on
θt . Farhi-Werning (2007) essentially restricts γt (θt ) to be equal across all θt , whereas Phelan (2006)
essentially restricts γt to be equal across dates t as well.
Note that if we let

(10)

again subject to ct (θt ) and yt (θt ) non-negative for all t and θt , resource feasibility (4), and, for the
case of private information, incentive compatibility (6). Note that given weights Γt (θt ), one can
also back out the implied weights γt (θt ) = Γt (θt ) − βΓt−1 (θt−1 ). In particular, note that although
arbitrary weights γt (θt ) ≥ 0 imply weights Γt (θt ) ≥ 0, that Γt (θt ) ≥ 0 for all t, θt does not imply
γt (θt ) ≥ 0 for all t, θt .

4. Full Information
In this section, we consider the implications of Pareto efficiency when θ realizations are public
information.
10

Lemma 2. Every Pareto efficient symmetric allocation solves the planner’s problem for some
weights Γt (θt ) > 0 for all t ≥ 0 and θt ∈ Θt . Likewise, if a symmetric allocation solves the
planner’s problem given weights Γt (θt ) > 0 for all t ≥ 0 and θt ∈ Θt , then it is Pareto efficient if
and only if Γt (θt ) − βΓt−1 (θt−1 ) ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0 and θt ∈ Θt (or, alternatively, if γt (θt ) ≥ 0 for
all t and θt ).
Proof. If a symmetric allocation {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0 is Pareto efficient, then it must lie on the frontier
of the utility possibilities set. The convexity of the utility possibilities set then ensures that it solves
PP for some specification γt (θt ) ≥ 0 for all t and θt . Next, the assumptions on u and h ensure any
Pareto efficient allocation has ct (θt ) and yt (θt ) each strictly positive for all t and θt . (Otherwise,
one could generate a Pareto improvement by marginally increasing both yt (θt ) and ct (θt ).) The
planner’s first order condition with respect to c0 (θ0 ) implies that
γ0 (θ0 )u0 (c0 (θ0 )) = λ > 0,

(11)

where λ is the Lagrange multiplier on the resource constraint. Thus, γ0 (θ0 ) = Γ0 (θ0 ) > 0 for all θ0 .
From the definition of Γt (θt ), this ensures Γt (θt ) > 0 for all t and θt .
Next assume that {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0 solves PP for weights Γt (θt ) > 0 for all t and θt such
that Γt (θt ) − βΓt−1 (θt−1 ) ≥ 0. This then implies that γt (θt ) ≥ 0 for all t and θt . That the allocation
is Pareto efficient is then immediate given that u is strictly increasing (non-satiation).
We now turn to the main characterization result for the full information economy.
Proposition 1. Assume for all dates t, a dynasty’s history of shocks θt is public information. Then
allocation {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0 is Pareto efficient if and only if it satisfies the resource condition (4)
with equality and for all t, and (θt , θt+1 ),
u0 (ct (θt ))θt = h0 (

11

yt (θt )
),
θt

(12)

and
u0 (ct (θt )) ≥ βRu0 (ct+1 (θt , θt+1 )).

(13)

Proof. From Lemma 2, if {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0 is Pareto efficient, then it solves PP for some Γt (θt ) > 0
for all t, θt . That the resource condition must hold with equality is then immediate. That (12) must
hold follows from comparing the planner’s first order conditions with respect to ct (θt ) and yt (θt ).
Next, the planner’s first order condition with respect to c0 (θ0 ) implies that
γ0 (θ0 )u0 (c0 (θ0 )) = λ,

(14)

where λ is the Lagrange multiplier on the resource constraint. Thus γ0 (θ0 ) > 0 for all θ0 . Next, the
planner’s first order condition with respect to ct (θt ) implies for all t ≥ 0 that
γt+1 (θt+1 ) =

Γt (θt )(u0 (ct (θt )) − βRu0 (ct+1 (θt+1 )))
.
Ru0 (ct+1 (θt+1 ))

(15)

Applying this sequentially from t = 0 on then delivers that u0 (ct (θt )) ≥ βRu0 (ct+1 (θt+1 )) is both
necessary and sufficient for γt+1 (θt+1 ) to be non-negative.
Next, assume that {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0 satisfies (4) at equality, condition (12) for all t ≤ T and
θt , and (13) for all t < T and θt+1 . Since PP is a concave programming problem, these are sufficient
for {ct (θt ), yt (θt )}Tt=0 to solve PP with weights γt (θt ) ≥ 0 defined by (15). Lemma 2 then implies
Pareto efficiency.
The intuition behind this result is that an allocation is Pareto efficient if it does not waste
resources, that no individual can be made better off by varying his labor effort and letting him
consume the resulting variation in output, and finally, that no type θt individual can be made
better off by reducing his consumption by  and increasing the consumption of his type θt+1 son by
R
 π(θt+1
|θt ) . Note that these conditions are exactly the same conditions as when periods are interpreted

as dates in a T + 1 lived individual’s life as opposed to generations, with the single exception that
condition (13) is a weak inequality instead of an equality. This condition implies that no father has
an unsatisfied desire to give a positive gift to any particular type son at an actuarially fair rate of
return. We next show that progressive estate taxes are not necessary for Pareto efficiency.

A. Full Information Tax Implementation
From Proposition (1), zero marginal labor taxes are necessary for any decentralized implementation of a Pareto efficient allocation.
Next, for any given allocation, define the implicit inheritance tax τt+1 (θt+1 ) on a type θt+1
son as solving
u0 (ct (θt )) = βRu0 (ct+1 (θt+1 ))(1 − τt+1 (θt+1 )).

(16)

This is the inheritance tax necessary to induce a type θt father to make exactly a zero transfer to
his θt+1 son if he takes the allocation as given but then is allowed to make positive or negative type
conditional transfers to his possible sons at actuarially fair rates of return.
The next result characterizes full information implied inheritance taxes in terms of the planner
weights.
Proposition 2. The full information inheritance tax is
τt+1 (θt+1 ) =

−γt+1 (θt+1 )
.
βΓt (θt )

(17)

Proof. The proof is immediate from the first order conditions of the full information planner’s
problem.
Proposition (2) implies that in any Pareto efficient full information allocation, the implicit
inheritance tax on a type θt+1 son is weakly negative and strictly negative if the son receives positive
weight γt+1 (θt+1 ) in the social planner’s problem.
13

If one sets T = 1 (so t ∈ {0, 1}), the resulting two period economy is very close to being a
full-information version of the private information two-period model of Farhi-Werning (2010) (the
only difference being that in Farhi-Werning (2010), second period agents have no θ type and cannot
work) and thus sheds some light on their result regarding the optimality of progressive inheritance
taxes.
In particular, Farhi-Werning (2010) assumes a social welfare function that is equivalent to
assuming that the Pareto weight on a son, γ1 , cannot depend on the type of the father, θ0 . Letting
T = 1 and requiring γ1 (θ0 , θ1 ) = γ1 (a constant) delivers

τ1 (θ0 ) =

−γ1
.
βγ0 (θ0 )

(18)

Thus, the higher the consumption of the date t = 0 father (which follows directly from a higher
γ0 (θ0 )), the higher (closer to zero) the common inheritance tax on his sons. That is, when γ1 is
restricted to be a constant, inheritance taxes are progressive.
But next consider allowing the Pareto weight of the son, γ1 (θ0 , θ1 ), to depend on the type
of the father, θ0 . (We can continue to restrict it to not depend on θ1 , the type of the son, for this
example.) Then (17) becomes
τ1 (θ0 ) =

−γ1 (θ0 )
,
βγ0 (θ0 )

(19)

and implicit inheritance taxes in a full information Pareto efficient allocation can be regressive
through an appropriate choice of γ1 (θ0 ). In particular, if we let θ0 ∈ {θ, θ} with γ0 (θ0 ) > γ0 (θ0 ) > 0
and set γ1 (θ) > 0 and γ1 (θ) = 0, then inheritances taxes are negative for the “rich” (θ types) and
zero for the “poor” (θ types) and thus regressive.

B. Full Information Property Rights Implementation
In this section, we establish that although inheritance taxes may be necessary to achieve a
particular Pareto efficient allocation, no taxes of any kind are necessary to achieve Pareto efficiency
14

in general.
To this end, define the full information laissez-faire allocation {c`t (θt ), yt` (θt )}Tt=0 as follows:
First, for all θT ∈ Θ, let
VT` (θT ) ≡ max u(y) − h(
y

y
).
θT

(20)

That is, VT` (θT ) is the value to a date T born agent of type θT of receiving a zero inheritance but
having a property right to his own production. Next, for t ∈ {0, . . . , T − 1} (and working backwards
from t = T − 1 to t = 0), define
Vt` (θt )

[u(cn (θt+1,n )) − h(

)] ≥ Vs` (θs ).

θ

(23)

Here, Vt` (θt ) is the value to a date t < T born agent of type θt of receiving a zero inheritance,
again having a property right to his own production, and further having the ability to control the
production and consumption of his descendants, as long as the expected discounted consumption
of himself and his descendants does not exceed their production (which implies the ability to make
actuarially fair conditional transfers to descendants) and these descendants do no worse than what
they could achieve on their own with a zero inheritance and these same rights. (Thus, condition
(23) implies that conditional inheritances be non-negative.) Once Vt` (θt ) is thus calculated for all
15

t ∈ {1, . . . , T }, the laissez-faire allocation then corresponds to the solution to the t = 0 problem
above for all θ0 .
Proposition 3. The full information laissez-faire allocation is Pareto efficient.
Proof. It is straightforward to show that the laissez-faire allocation has (22) hold as an equality for
each θ0 type. (Otherwise, each θ0 type could simply consume the extra resources himself.) That
is, under the laissez-faire allocation, the expected discounted dynastic consumption of each θ0 type
equals its expected discounted dynastic output.
Suppose there exists an allocation that Pareto dominates the laissez-faire allocation. That
β > 0 and π(θ|θ− ) > 0 for all (θ, θ− ) implies that at least one first generation θ0 type agent is strictly
better off in this Pareto-improving allocation. Further, since the allocation is a Pareto improvement,
it satisfies (23) for all s ≥ 1 and (θ1,s ). Thus, it must be the case that for this first generation θ0
type, (22) is violated, otherwise the first generation θ0 type would have chosen it. That is, under the
Pareto-improving allocation, the expected discounted dynastic consumption of at least one θ0 type
exceeds its expected discounted dynastic output. The society-wide resource constraint then implies
that for at least one θ0 type, say θ̂0 , its expected discounted dynastic output exceeds its expected
discounted dynastic consumption. Further, since the new plan is a Pareto improvement, conditions
(23) are satisfied for the θ̂0 type’s problem. Thus, the θ̂0 type could have chosen his part of the
Pareto-improving allocation with (22) holding as a strict inequality, which is a contradiction.
The Pareto efficient full information laissez-faire allocation can be implemented with no taxes
whatsoever (no labor taxes, no inheritance taxes). It does require property rights and sufficient
insurance markets, however. In particular, fathers need to be able to make conditional transfers to
their sons, and the sons need to be protected from fathers making negative conditional transfers.
In fact, these property rights for children not to receive a negative inheritance is where

16

positive Pareto weights γt (θt ) occur. Recall from (15) that
γt+1 (θt+1 ) =

Γt (θt )(u0 (ct (θt )) − βRu0 (ct+1 (θt+1 )))
.
Ru0 (ct+1 (θt+1 ))

(24)

That is, a type θt+1 agent is associated with a strictly positive Pareto weight when u0 (ct (θt )) >
βRu0 (ct+1 (θt+1 )) or precisely when, under the laissez-faire allocation, his father wishes he could
make him a negative conditional transfer. Likewise, sons who receive a positive inheritance, which
from the father’s intertemporal first order condition when (23) is slack ensures that u0 (ct (θt )) =
βRu0 (ct+1 (θt+1 )), have γt+1 (θt+1 ) = 0.

5. Private Information
With private information, characterization of the set of Pareto efficient allocations is less
straightforward. In this section, we present three main results. First, we completely characterize
the set of Pareto efficient allocations for the two-period economy of Farhi-Werning (2010) subject
to a restriction that θ ∈ {θ, θ} and show that, like the economy with full information, in constrained
efficient allocations, implicit inheritance taxes can be either progressive or regressive, depending on
the particular constrained efficient allocation. That is, we show the result of Farhi-Werning (2010)
that optimal implicit inheritance taxes are progressive depends crucially on their assumption that
societal preferences toward unborn generations reflect, in their words, a “preference for equality”
regarding the consumption of unborn generations. In our environment, in which a son born to a
father of one θ type is considered a different person (for the purpose of Pareto efficiency comparisons)
than a son born to a father of a different θ type, this progressivity result no longer holds.
Second, we show that the “inverse Euler condition” result of Golosov, Kocherlakota, and
Tsyvinski (2003) (hereafter, GKT) (itself a generalization of Rogerson (1985)) holds as a necessary
condition for any incentive constrained Pareto efficient allocation, but as an inequality as opposed
to an equality as in GKT. This result is an interesting parallel to our similar result given full
17

information. There, the normal (non-inverse) Euler condition u0 (ct (θt )) ≥ βRu0 (ct+1 (θt+1 )) holds
necessarily as an equality when only the first generation receives positive Pareto weights and holds
as an inequality when future generations are given positive direct, history-dependent Pareto weights.
Here, for the case of private information, we again show that the exact same necessary condition
that holds as an equality when only the first generation receives positive Pareto weights — now the
inverse Euler condition — holds as a weak inequality when future generations are given positive
direct, history-dependent Pareto weights.
Finally, we consider the efficiency of the laissez-faire allocation given private information.
Here, we first show that if θ0 (the skill realization of the initial generation) is public but θt is private
for all t ≥ 1, then the laissez-faire allocation is constrained efficient. We then consider the case in
which θ0 is private as well.

A. Farhi-Werning (2010)
Farhi-Werning (2010) (hereafter, FW) is a two-period version of our economy with one basic
exception: in FW, second period agents (children) cannot produce. In this section, we completely
characterize the set of constrained Pareto efficient allocations in such an economy (when types are
restricted to be either low or high) and show that implicit inheritance taxes are progressive if the
Pareto weights on children are restricted to be independent of their father’s type, as FW essentially
assume in their social welfare function approach, but can be either progressive or regressive if the
Pareto weights on children can depend on the type of their father (or children of high types are
assumed to be different people, for the purposes of Pareto comparisons, than the children of low
types). The next proposition characterizes the set of constrained efficient allocations.
Proposition 4. For the two-period economy t ∈ {0, 1} such that only t = 0 agents can produce,
an incentive compatible, resource feasible allocation (c∗0 (θ), y ∗ (θ), c∗1 (θ)), θ ∈ {θ, θ} is constrained

18

Pareto efficient if and only if
1. the resource constraint holds with equality,
2. the low type has a weak residual motive to work more, or
u0 (c∗0 (θ))θ ≥ h0 (

4. for each θ ∈ {θ, θ} the date t = 0 father has a weak residual motive to transfer consumption
from his son to himself, or
u0 (c∗0 (θ)) ≥ βRu0 (c∗1 (θ)).
5. Finally, let M C(θ) ≡

(27)

f (θ)
u0 (c∗0 (θ)) ,

or M C(θ) equals the marginal societal cost of providing utility


from consumption to type θ, and let M U (θ) ≡ f (θ) u0 (c1∗ (θ)) − h0 (y∗θ(θ)/θ) , or M U (θ) equals
0

the marginal societal cost of increasing both consumption and output for type θ such that the
utility for type θ stays constant. Then (as part of the necessary and sufficient conditions for
(c∗0 (θ), y ∗ (θ), c∗1 (θ)) to be constrained efficient), one needs for θ = θ, θc = θ as well as θ = θ,
θc = θ,

Proof. That the resource constraint must hold as an equality is immediate. (Increasing first period
consumption to raise the utility of each type of father by an equal amount is incentive compatible and
19

Pareto improving.) Thus, (c∗0 (θ), h∗ (θ), c∗1 (θ)) is Pareto efficient if and only if there exist γ0 (θ) ≥ 0

If each of the constraints is subtracted from the objective function to form a Lagrangian (with
multipliers f (θ)µ(θ, θc ) on the incentive constraints and λ on equation (31)), then the derivatives of
this Lagrangian with respect to u0 (θ), u1 (θ), and h(θ) give rise to the following first order conditions:

Since f (θ)λγ0 (θ) ≥ 0, this delivers (28) as a necessary condition.
For sufficiency, note that if one finds an allocation (c0 (θ), y(θ), c1 (θ)) satisfying the derived
necessary conditions, these solve the Lagrangian above (which in the transformed choice variables
has a convex objective function and linear constraints and thus satisfies the Kuhn-Tucker conditions)
with λγ0 (θ) ≥ 0 defined by (37) and λγ1 (θ) ≥ 0 defined by (36).
Next we show that implicit inheritance taxes are progressive if the Pareto weight on the child
of a high type parent is restricted to be equal to the Pareto weight on the child of a low type parent,
or γ1 (θ) = γ1 (θ), but can be progressive or regressive if these Pareto weights are not so restricted.
Proposition 5. Let (c∗0 (θ), y ∗ (θ), c∗1 (θ)), θ ∈ {θ, θ} be a constrained efficient allocation for the two
period economy t ∈ {0, 1} such that only t = 0 agents can produce, and let its associated implicit
inheritance tax τ (θ) solve u0 (c∗0 (θ)) = βRu0 (c∗1 (θ))(1 − τ (θ)). Then, if Pareto weights are restricted
such that γ1 (θ) = γ1 (θ) > 0, τ (θ) < τ (θ) < 0 (or inheritance taxes are negative and progressive). If
instead γ1 (θ) ≥ 0 and γ1 (θ) ≥ 0 are unrestricted, then inheritance taxes remain (weakly) negative
but can be either progressive or regressive.
Proof. First, note that if one solves for τ (θ) from its definition, one derives

τ (θ) =

Thus, c0 (θ) < c0 (θ), which (49) then implies τ (θ) < τ (θ), or inheritance taxes are progressive when

Finally, if γ1 (θ) = 0 and γ1 (θ) > 0, then (49) implies τ (θ) = 0 and τ (θ) < 0, and thus
τ (θ) > τ (θ) or inheritance taxes are regressive.

B. The Inverse Euler Condition
In this section we establish that the inverse Euler condition of Golosov, Kochkerlakota and
Tsvynski (2003) must hold as an inequality in any constrained efficient allocation.
Proposition 6. For the T +1-period economy with t ∈ {0, . . . , T }, an incentive compatible, resource
feasible allocation {c∗t (θt ), yt∗ (θt )}Tt=0 is constrained Pareto efficient only if for all t < T and θt ,

ut (θt ) by ∆ ≥ 0 and increasing ut+1 (θt+1 ) by ∆/β for all θt+1 , and otherwise leaving the allocation
unchanged, the perturbed policy remains in the constraint set. Further, it affects the objective
function only in the terms for dates t and t + 1 following history θt . Thus, if {c∗t (θt ), yt∗ (θt )}Tt=0 is
constrained Pareto efficient, a choice of ∆ = 0 must solve

C. Private Information Property Rights Implementation
In this section, we mimic the results established under full information. In particular, we
establish conditions under which no taxes of any kind are necessary to achieve Pareto efficiency.
Our first result is that if θ0 is public information, but θt for all t ≥ 1 is private, then the private
information laissez-faire allocation is Pareto efficient.
Define the laissez-faire allocation exactly as with full information except that at each step
of deriving V ` (θt ), a date t, type θt agent faces a further constraint that his descendants must be
willing to truthfully reveal their types (assuming all of their descendants truthfully reveal), or for
all s ≥ t + 1, θt+1,s , and θ̂,

With private information, Vt` (θt ) is the value to a date t < T born agent of type θt of receiving
a zero inheritance subject to the same conditions as with full information but with one additional
condition: Again, the date t type θt agent has a property right to his own production and the ability
to control the production and consumption of his descendants. Again, the expected discounted
consumption of himself and his descendants must not exceed their production (which implies the
ability to make actuarially fair conditional transfers to descendants) and these descendants do no
worse than what they could achieve on their own with a zero inheritance and these same rights.
But added is a constraint that the date t agent must choose a consumption-output plan for his
descendants that induces them to truthfully reveal their types. Once Vt` (θt ) is thus calculated for
all t ≥ 1, the laissez-faire allocation with private information then corresponds to the solution to the
25

t = 0 problem for all θ0 . Note that nowhere in this definition of the private information laissez-faire
allocation is a condition that a date t = 0, θ0 type agent be willing to truthfully reveal his type.
Proposition 7. If θ0 is publicly observable but θt , t ≥ 1 is private, the private information laissezfaire allocation is constrained Pareto efficient.
Proof. The proof is essentially identical to the full information case. It is straightforward to show
that the laissez-faire allocation with private information has (22) hold as an equality for each θ0
type. (Otherwise, each θ0 type could simply consume the extra resources himself without upsetting
incentive compatibility.) So as with full information, under the private information laissez-faire allocation, the expected discounted dynastic consumption of each θ0 type equals its expected discounted
dynastic output.
Next suppose there exists a feasible incentive-compatible allocation that Pareto dominates
the private information laissez-faire allocation. Again, that β > 0 and π(θ|θ− ) > 0 for all (θ, θ− )
implies that at least one first generation θ0 type agent is strictly better off in this Pareto-improving
allocation. Further, since the allocation is a Pareto improvement, it satisfies (23) for all s ≥ 1
and (θ1,s ). Finally, since the allocation is incentive compatible, it satisfies (58) for all s ≥ 1 and
(θ1,s ). Thus, it must be the case that for this first generation θ0 type, (22) is violated, otherwise the
first generation θ0 type would have chosen it. That is, under the Pareto-improving allocation, the
expected discounted dynastic consumption of at least one θ0 type exceeds its expected discounted
dynastic output. The society-wide resource constraint then implies that for at least one θ0 type, say
θ̂0 , its expected discounted dynastic output exceeds its expected discounted dynastic consumption.
Further, since the new plan is an incentive-compatible Pareto improvement, conditions (23) and
(58) are satisfied for the θ̂0 type’s problem. Thus, the θ̂0 type could have chosen his part of the
Pareto-improving allocation with (22) holding as a strict inequality, which is a contradiction.

26

Of course, a more natural assumption is that θt is private for all dates t, including t = 0.
It is not immediate, however, that a type θ0 would prefer his own private information laissez-faire
allocation over the private information laissez-faire allocation associated with type θ̂0 6= θ0 . However,
if a type θ0 prefers the allocation chosen by a type θ̂0 , this implies that the allocation chosen by the
θ̂0 type is not in his constraint set. (Otherwise, the θ0 type would have chosen it.) But a date t = 0
agent’s type shows up in the constraint set of the laissez-faire allocation problem only in (22) — the
condition that expected discounted consumption of an agent and his descendants not exceed the
expected discounted production of the agent and his descendants. And in this condition, the date
t = 0 agent’s type shows up only in term π(θ1 |θ0 ). Thus, the following proposition is immediate.
Proposition 8. If π(θ|θ− ) is i.i.d., the private information laissez-faire allocation is constrained
Pareto efficient.
Next, we consider alternative assumptions that ensure that the private information laissezfaire allocation is constrained Pareto efficient. In particular, in the next proposition we assume only
two θ types (high and low) and that although high θ types can claim to be low θ types, the reverse
is not true. In essence, for this proposition, we assume the existence of a skills test that high skill
types can purposely fail if they wish to pretend to be the low skill type, but low skill types cannot
pass.
Proposition 9. Suppose Θ = {θ, θ} and βR ≤ 1. Then the private information laissez-faire
allocation of the high θ0 is preferred by him to the private information laissez-faire allocation of the
low θ0 type. Thus, if a low skill type cannot pretend to be high skill type, the private information
laissez-faire allocation is constrained Pareto efficient.
Proof. First, define the autarkic allocation (ca (θ), y a (θ)) such that ca (θ) = y a (θ) and u0 (y a (θ))θ =
h0 (y a /θ). The autarkic allocation is in the constraint set of θ0 types. Next, let T = 1 (so t ∈ {0, 1})
27

and let θ0 = θ. Here, one can show that the laissez-faire allocation has the θ0 = θ type choosing
the autarkic allocation. (Under the autarkic allocation, u0 (c0 (θ)) ≤ βRu0 (c1 (θ, θ)) since c0 (θ)) =
c1 (θ, θ) = ca (θ) and βR ≤ 1. Likewise, u0 (c0 (θ)) < βRu0 (c1 (θ, θ)) since c0 (θ)) = ca (θ) < c1 (θ, θ) =
ca (θ) and βR ≤ 1. Thus, the θ0 = θ type would, at the margin, weakly prefer to make negative
conditional transfers to both son types, which is ruled out by (23). Thus, autarky (or no conditional
transfers) satisfies his optimization problem.) But next note that the autarkic allocation is in the
constraint set of the high θ0 = θ type as well, ensuring that the private information laissez-faire
allocation chosen by the θ0 = θ type is weakly preferred by him to autarky, proving the result for
T = 2.
Next, let T = 3. Here again, one can show that the private information laissez-faire allocation
has the θ0 = θ type choosing zero transfers to both son types. Here, the θ0 = θ type chooses the
continuation allocation for his θ son to be the autarkic allocation and chooses the continuation
allocation for his θ son to correspond to the T = 2 private information laissez-faire allocation. (This
is in the constraint set of the θ0 = θ type and has u0 (c0 (θ)) ≤ βRu0 (c1 (θ, θ1 )) for both θ1 types; thus
again, the θ0 = θ type weakly prefers to make negative conditional transfers.) The argument then
iterates backward. By noting that if the θ0 = θ type chooses zero conditional transfers to both son
types, then the private information laissez-faire allocation for θ0 = θ is in the constraint set of the
θ0 = θ, and the proof is complete.

6. Extensions
In the previous sections, agents were assumed to live for one period and care about their
descendants. In reality, however, individuals do not live one day but many, and in each of these
days some relevant information about their type is realized or revealed. Thus, an individual after
one additional day of his life has a different history from the one he had until yesterday. Should
this individual be considered, from the point of view of the efficiency of the allocations, a different
28

individual from the self he was yesterday? To formally analyze this question, we introduce a simple
extension of the model in which an individual lives for two periods and cares about his descendants.
(Later, it will become clear how to extend this to N periods.) Further, we assume that the physical
attributes of the environment are unchanged and that preferences over allocations (equation (5))
are also unchanged. To link this current extended model to the previous one, in this section we
consider the effects of assuming that for an agent born at t = 0, date t = 1 refers not to the lifetime
of his son but rather to the second half of his own life. Likewise, date t = 2 refers to the first half
of his son’s life, date t = 3 refers to the second half of his son’s life, and so on.
In this construction, it follows immediately that if the preference ordering of an agent’s
future self is considered for the purposes of Pareto rankings exactly as his sons were in the previous
sections, nothing changes. The set of Pareto efficient allocations is the same as when agents live
for one period, and the implications for inheritance taxes and the efficiency of laissez-faire are also
unchanged, with or without private information.
However, if for the purposes of Pareto rankings we consider only an agent’s preference ordering
at birth, then the set of Pareto efficient allocations is a strict subset of the set of Pareto efficient
allocations when agents live for only one period. Nevertheless, our main results, modified versions
of Propositions (1) through (9), go through.
Specifically, recall that under full information and agents living for one period, in Proposition
(1) we show that a symmetric allocation is Pareto efficient if and only if the resource constraint (4)
holds with equality, that labor is not distorted (condition (12) for all t and θt ), and for all t and
θt+1 ,
u0 (ct (θt )) ≥ βRu0 (ct+1 (θt , θt+1 )).

(58)

When agents live for two periods and only their beginning of life preferences are considered for
Pareto rankings, this result is unchanged except that (58) holds only for odd dates t. In words, this

29

requires that no father, in his second period of life, has an unsatisfied desire to give a positive gift to
any particular type son at an actuarially fair rate of return. For even dates t, the inequality in (58)
is replaced with an equality. This condition requires that no father, in his first period of life, has
an unsatisfied desire to make either positive or negative conditional transfers to his second period
of life, again at an actuarially fair rate of return.
Thus modified, Proposition (1 ) now implies, under full information that an agent’s consumption in the second period of life does not depend on his second period θ realization; he insures against
this. Further, the implicit savings tax (the implicit inheritance tax in the previous sections but for
even dates t) must be zero in any Pareto efficient allocation, whereas the implicit inheritance taxes
(or “wedges” for odd dates t) are again non-positive and can be progressive or regressive. That is,
Proposition (2) continues to hold, but only at odd dates t. Proposition (3), that the full information
laissez-faire allocation is efficient, holds as well, but in modified form. The modification here is that
in the definition of the t date laissez-faire allocation, condition (23) (that agents cannot give descendants born in date s allocations that to them are worse than the date s laissez-faire allocation)
now must hold only for even dates s. Finally, with similar modifications, Propositions (6) through
(9), which characterize the constrained efficiency of the private information laissez-faire allocation,
hold as well.
In this extension, we altered the lifetime of an agent from one period to two. The extension
to N is straightforward. But we have not changed the length of a time period (although our results
hold for all β, π, and R). A second extension is to set up our model so that the length of a time
period can brought to zero. We then consider the extreme assumption that an individual lives
for only an instant, and at every instant a new person is born with rights in determining Pareto
rankings. Even with this extreme assumption, we show that the set of Pareto efficient allocations
is non-trivial.

30

To this end, let ∆ be the length of a time period and assume that agents discount the future
by the continuous time parameter b so that β(∆) = exp(−b∆). Likewise, if r is the continuous time
analogue to R, let R(∆) = exp(r∆). Finally, assume that θ ∈ {θ, θ}, let λ represent the constant
Poisson probability of transiting from state θ to state θ, and let λ represent the constant Poisson
probability of transiting from state θ to state θ. Then π(θ|θ)(∆) = 1 − λ∆, π(θ|θ)(∆) = λ∆,
π(θ|θ)(∆) = 1 − λ∆, and π(θ|θ)(∆) = 1 − λ∆. With β, R, and π thus defined as functions of ∆, we
can consider sequences of economies with ∆ converging to zero.
At each point in such a sequence, each of our propositions hold. For instance, the full
information efficiency characterization Proposition (1) has that for any Pareto efficient allocation,
resources must be exhausted (condition (4) holds as an equality) and the intratemporal laborconsumption efficiency condition (12) must hold; thus these must hold in the limiting economy as
well. Regarding intertemporal consumption paths, we have (analogous to (58)) for all t and θt+∆
u0 (ct (θt )) ≥ exp((r − b)∆)u0 (ct+∆ (θt+∆ )).

(59)

Heuristically, as ∆ → 0 (assuming ċt is well defined), then
c˙t ≥ (r − b)/(−

u00 (ct )
).
u0 (ct )

(60)

In words, when every instant a new person is realized for the purposes of Pareto ranking allocations,
a necessary condition for the stochastic process ct to be Pareto efficient in the full information
economy is that the growth rate of consumption, realization by realization, is bounded below by the
difference between technological and preference rates of discount, divided by the absolute level of
risk aversion at that consumption level. If r = b (or βR = 1 for all ∆), this condition implies that
all consumption paths must be non-decreasing over time.

31

7. Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced a natural method of considering Pareto efficiency in dynamic economies with altruism toward children and uncertainty regarding their skill. We argued
that efficiency requires taking into account the desire of individuals to insure against uncertainty,
but only against the real uncertainty they face — for example, that of fathers regarding the skill
endowment of their children. The same concept does not require individuals to insure against events
that have already happened, and this characteristic in fact defines who they are. For example, there
is no uncertainty on the child’s part regarding the realization of his skill. If we look at the characterization of efficiency in terms of the weights on individuals used by the social planner, our definition
is equivalent to the one in which the weights over an individual may depend on the history of type
realizations of his dynasty until his birth date.
We show that by adopting this natural definition, we substantially extend the set of Pareto
efficient allocations. That the true set of efficient allocations is strictly larger is easy to see in the
case of complete information economies. The set of efficient allocations for these economies can be
completely characterized. An allocation is efficient in this case if and only if every father would not
want to make, at that allocation, direct transfers to any of his child’s type realizations. Although
this is a substantial extension of the efficient set, substantial restrictions are still imposed by the
efficiency requirement, and they are naturally induced by the altruism of the father.
In general we show that, properly understood, Pareto efficiency does not require special
forms of government intervention, such as progressive inheritance taxes, to correct market failures.
In other words, progressive taxation cannot be justified on efficiency grounds alone. Even a total
absence of government intervention may result in efficient allocations.

32

8. Appendix: Continuous Time Model
The economy lasts for an interval [0, T ]. Individuals are born at every integer time in the
interval, live for one time unit, and have a single offspring who lives in the next period. At every
time t, the history of the person is the path of types of his forefathers and his own path up to that
moment.
The set of types is a finite set Θ. The set of type paths is the set Ω of functions from [0, T ]
to Θ that are right continuous and piecewise constant. Let
λ = diag(λθ1 , . . . , λθn )

(61)

with λθi ≥ 0 be the Poisson rate in the state θi . Let π be a stochastic matrix, with π(·|θi ) ∈ ∆(Θ)
the transition probability at θi if a transition occurs. The process on Θ is defined as follows. At
state θi , a change in the state occurs at Poisson rate λθi ; if a change occurs, the state transits to θi
with probability π(θj |θi ). The probability P on (Ω, F) is induced by this process.
Note that λ and π define an invariant measure on Θ as the solution µ of
µ(I − λπ) = 0, µ({Θ}) = 1,

(62)

where I is the identity matrix. At every time t, the probability that the state is θi is µ(θi ).
Definition 1. An allocation a is a pair (c, y) of functions from Ω × [0, T ] to the set C × Y of
consumption and outputs.
Note that an allocation defines consumption and output for the nth member of the dynasty
living in the time interval [n, n + 1). We call this member a person. An individual in this economy
is identified by the history until the point in time at which the individual appears, namely, the path
ω restricted to [0, t]. Thus, each person has a continuum of individual realizations.
Let r and b be positive numbers. The technology available allows transfer of the accumulated
asset at the rate ers . An allocation is feasible if

Consider now a small time interval ∆t. For each such interval, consider the set of allocations
that are constant in the time interval [i∆t, (i + 1)∆t) for every i. Utility is not constant over such
interval because the type can change, as can the disutility cost of effort. For such a time interval, we
have a discrete economy as defined in the main text. For such an economy, feasibility and efficiency
have been defined.
Definition 2. An allocation is efficient if it is the limit of ∆t-efficient allocations.
Lemma 3. If condition (64) holds the set of efficient allocations is non-empty.
