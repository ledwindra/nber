    "abstract": "\n\nJapan has experienced turbulent behavior of land prices after World War II, especially after 1985.  This paper first examines the explanatory power of a simple present-value model and shows its limitation.  We then investigate two additional (not mutually exclusive) factors affecting the Japanese land price behavior: distortionary inheritance and capital-gains taxation, and excessive price sensitivity due to the non-Walrasian structure of the land market.  Empirical results show that distortionary taxation is a major culprit of high residential land price, and that the non-Walrasian price behavior magnifies the effect of underlying change in the market fundamentals.\n\n",
