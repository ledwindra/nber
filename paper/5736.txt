ARE 401 (K) PLANS REPLACING OTHER

PENSIONS?
EVIDENCE FROM PANEL DATA

ABSTRACT

This paper examines whether sponsors of traditional defined benefit (DB) plans are replacing
them with 401 (k) or other defined contribution (DC) plans. I compare pension plan offerings by
sponsors of a DB plan in 1985 with their offerings in 1992 using Form 5500 filings from those two
years.

I find that 401(k) and other DC plans are substituting

for terminated DB plans and that

offering a DC plan of any type increases the probability of a DB termination.

Thus, it appears that,

at the sponsor level, many of the new 401(k) plans may not be avenues for net saving but are
replacements for the more traditional pension forms.
Using several specifications, I estimate that a sponsor that starts with no 401 (k) or other DC
plan and adds a 401(k) is predicted to reduce the number of DB plans offered by at least 0.3. That
is, the estimates imply that one sponsor terminates a DB plan for about every three sponsors that
offer one new 401 (k) plan. The addition of a non-40 1(k) DC plan is estimated to reduce DB plan
offerings by at least 0.4.
Plan-level

point estimates indicate that if a 401 (k) plan is added by a sponsor, the DB

termination probability increases by about 18 percentage pointsto35

percent. The addition of a non-

401(k) DC plan similarly increases the probability that an accompanying DB plan will be terminated.

This paper explores whether this shift

in relative importance is due in part to changing forms of employer pensions.
Evidence of plan substitution on the part of the employer would raise a
cautionary flag about the degree to which the growth in 401(k) plans and
assets are net saving.
Despite uncertain effects on net saving, the concept of the individual
saving plan as employer-provided

pension continues to be popular.

Recent

legislation creates a variation on the 401(k) plan for small business with
fewer anti-discrimination

requirements called the SIMPLE plan:

Incentive Match Plan for Employees.

Savings

Employees contribute the minimum of up to

three percent of salary or $6,000 per year.

Employers are required to match

the contribution, but ❑ay temporarily drop their match rate to one percent in
unprofitable years.

Clearly, it is important to resolve the effects of these

tax-deferred saving plans on net saving both on the part of individuals as
well as their employers.

be surprising to see DBs terminated by closing firms and 401(k)s created by

In fact, this supposition is confirmed by evidence

from the early 1980s, as reviewed in the next section.

EXISTING EVIDENCE
Two strands of literature address, either directly or indirectly,

substitution between types of pension plans.

The first research arose from

concern about wide-spread DB terminations during the mid-1970s

to ❑id-1980s,

and documents broad economy-wide shifts in the shares of employees covered by
types of plans but does not link shifts to changes in plan offerings.
Gustman and Steinmeier

(1992) analyze the role of unions, firm size, and

industry composition using repeated cross sections from Form 5500 filings.
They find that these factors could account for at most half of the decline in
primary DB coverage from 1977 to 1985 (from 89.7 percent in 1977 to 79.3
percent in 1985).
Clark and McDermed

(1990) estimate that only 3,1 of the 15 percentage

point decline in the proportion of DB coverage between 1979 and 1983 can be
explained by changes in the size distribution of firms and industrial

composition.

Using the 1979 and 1983 Current Population Survey supplements on

pension coverage and the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, they conclude that
demographic , employer size, and broad industry and occupation variables
explain none of the coverage decline.

They speculate that pension regulation

could be responsible for the increased use of DC plans.
Petersen (1992) examines DB terminations without directly addressing the
shift to DC plans.

He finds that financial factors play a strong role in the

decision to terminate overfunded DB plans (greater needs for cash and higher
costs in obtaining external capital increase the risk of termination and a
reversion of assets).
The issue of plan t~e

substitution is raised with sponsors directly in

a recent survey by Papke, Petersen, and Poterba (.1996). They find that only
one (albeit large) sponsor in their small sample of 43 plans reports a DB
termination as a result of 401(k) plan introduction between 1986 and 1990.
However, there is evidence of widespread DC conversion,
of a thrift/saving or profit-sharing

that is, replacement

plan with a plan with 401(k) features.

Forty-five percent of responding firms, representing 37 percent of 401(k)
participants

in the survey, indicate that another pension plan was converted

to the 401(k).

fie survey responses indicate that 401(k) plans typically

supplement a preexisting DB plan (63 percent) or DC plan (19 percent).
The

❑ ost

complete analysis of substitution between DB and DC plans is by

Kruse (1995), in which he tabulates participation and assets for the entire
pension sector.

He ❑atches sponsors using Form 5500 data from 1980 and 1986

to study adoptions and terminations of different types of plans, and estimates
the number of employees involved.

For each type of plan, he tabulates

participant counts for companies that adopt, maintain, or terminate a plan

6

(plan categories are DB, All DC, Profit sharing, and Employee Stock Option
Plans) over this period.
Kruse’s key conclusions

in the current context are the following:

(1)

Very little of the growth in DC participants came from companies that
terminated DB plans, with
DB status; (2)

❑ ost

growth coming from companies with no change in

The largest declines in DB participation came from companies

that had no change in DB or DC status; (3) Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPS,
a type of DC plan) tend to supplement rather than replace DB plans.

Kruse

documents a total of 7.2 million 401(k) participants as of 1986 (out of a
total of almost 33 million DC participants), but 401(k) data are not available
for 1980 and he is unable to isolate the effect of the adoption of 401(k)s on
other plan offerings or participant counts.
These findings are reflected in the aggregate data presented in Table 1.
The pension sector over the first half of the 1980s is broadly characterized
by a stable number of net DB plans, and a net increase in the number of and
participation

in DC plans.

While the number of large single employer DC plans

(with 100 or more participants)

rises from 12,978 to 25,713 over this period,

net DB plans are virtually unchanged

(22,424 in 1980 and 22,426 in 1986).

However, the aggregate data from the latter half of the 1980s and early
1990s suggest a need to re-examine the issue of substitution of DC for DB

Second, as Table 1 illustrates, adoption of 401(k) plans escalates over
this period.

The availability of 401(k) plans rises from 29,869 in 1985 to

139,704 in 1992.

The number of active participants

(who ❑ay also participate

in other plans) more than doubles (from 10.3 million in 1985 to 22.4 ❑illion

If a DB plan does not appear in the final 1992 filings but its

terminated.

A DB plan is also considered terminated if the 1992 filing

indicates the plan has been terminated (but the sponsor is required to file
until all assets are distributed) or indicates that a resolution to terminate
the plan has been filed.
To construct the panel of DB plans, I match the DB plans of the sponsors

information.

While the sponsors must be ongoing in 1992 to enter the sample,

the DB plan need not be.

There are two striking changes between the 1985 and 1992 samples that
parallel the aggregate data presented in Table 1.

ECONOMETRIC ESTWTES
As past work indicates, many factors enter into DB termination.

The

primary purpose of this paper is to estimate the role of 401(k) offerings on a
sponsor’s DB offerings.
A.

Sponsor-level Estimates of Plan Substitution

Table 6 presents estima~es of the effect of the change in the number of
401(k) or other DC plan offerings on the change in the number of DB plans
offered by the sponsor.

Specifying the regression equation in changes over

the two years holds constant any characteristics of the sponsor that do not
change over the period.

The (log of) the level of firm employment in 1985 is

included rather than the change in firm employment, because firm employment is
missing for 45 percent of plans in the 1992 data.11
Estimates of the

❑ ost

complete model are presented in column four and

indicate that both 401(k) and DC plans are substitutes for DB plans.

The

addition of a 401(k) plan over this period results in a reduction of 0.184 of
a DB plan,

In other words, a DB plan is predicted to be terminated for about

every five 401(k) plans added.

An additional non-401(k) DC plan is estimated

to result in a reduction of 0.152 of a DB plan,

after controlling for total

firm employment in 1985 and industry dummies.
In the sample, 66.12 percent (4,611 out of 6,974) of employers do not
change the number of 401(k) plans offered, and 28,95 percent (2,019) add at
least one.

The number of net 401(k) plans added is 2,071.

Thus , the point

estimate indicates that these additional 2,071 401(k) plans are associated
with a loss of about 381 DB plans, 10.81 percent of all DB plans lost to

than one 401(k). )

Similar dummy categories are defined for non-401(k) DC plans, adjusted for the
fact that there may be multiple DC plans in 1985.

The coefficient estimates

on these dummy variables are interpreted relative to the base or omitted
category:

the firm offers no 401(k) or DC plan in 1985 or 1992.

The effects of 401(k) and DC plan status reported in Table 7 are fairly
consistent across the models and again indicate substitution across the plan
t~es,

The r-squared of the regression indicates that almost 12 percent of

the variation in DB plan offerings by sponsors is explained by the status of
accompanying 401(k) or other DC plans (column 2).
The

❑ ost

complete model is presented in column four and includes the log

of firm employment in 1985 and industry dummies.

These estimates indicate

that the addition of at least one 401(k) plan reduces the number of DB plans
by 0.312 relative to a sponsor that offers no 401(k) or other DC plan.

(This

is essentially the same as adding one 401(k) plan since 85 percent of sponsors

This estimate implies that a sponsor

terminates a DB plan for about every three sponsors that offer at least one
new 401(k) plan.

Since 2,019 sponsors added at least one 401(k), this

estimate predicts a loss of 630 DB plans or almost 18 percent of the DB plans

Non-401(k) DC plans like ESOPS or profit-sharing plans are also
estimated to be substitutes for terminated DB plans in two out of three
situations.

The estimated effects are larger than those for 401(k) plans.

The addition of a DC plan reduces the number of DB plans offered by 0.410.

If

2.4 sponsors offer at least one new DC plan, then one DB plan is predicted to
be terminated.

These estimated effects are also highly statistically

Apparently, despite the different nature of these plans, by the

latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, 401(k)s and other DC plans have
begun to replace DB plans.
What is the extent of substitution between new 401(k)s and non-401(k) DC
plans?

Recall that earlier work did find evidence of conversion of DC into

401(k) plans, and this is confirmed in Tables 8 and 9.

The most complete

model (column four of Table 9) provides unambiguous evidence of substitution
for these plan types as well.

The preferred estimates in Table 9 indicate

that .241 of a DC plan is terminated for each 401(k) added.

And, a terminated 401(k) plan leads to .499 of a DC plan.

Plan-level Estimates of DB Plan Termination

How does the change in 401(k) or other DC status change the probability
that an accompanying DB plan will be terminated?

Tables 10 and 11 present

linear probability ❑odels estimated on the panel of DB plans.

The dependent

variable equals one if the DB plan is terminated by 1992 and zero otherwise.
That is, the dependent variable equals one if the Form 5500 indicates that the
plan has been terminated recently, or if a resolution to terminate the plan
has been filed, or if the plan is missing from the final 1992 filings but the

19

sponsor has filed Form 5500s for other plans (presumed terminated).
The estimates in the fourth column of Table 10 indicate that the
addition of a 401(k) plan over this period increases the probability of DB
termination by .044 or by 4.4 percentage points.

The addition of a DC plan

similarly increases the DB termination probability by 4.2 percentage points.
The effects of 1985 firm employment and plan assets continue to be small -- an
increase of 10 percent in 1985 firm employment increases the termination
probability by 0.37 percentage points, and a 10 percent increase in plan
assets reduces the termination probability by .52 percentage points.
In Table 11, the three plan status categories are included for 401(k)
and DC plans.

In column four, which includes industry dummies and controls

for firm employment and plan assets in 1985, an additional 401(k) plan is
estimated to increase the termination probability of the accompanying DB plan
by 15.5 percentage points relative to a DB plan of a sponsor with no 401(k) or
DC plan.

This 15.5 percentage point increase in the probability of

termination is large relative to the unconditional

c.

Changes in DB and Non-401(k) DC Plan Participation

Given the legal complications of plan termination, substitution between
a defined benefit and 401(k) plan may be a more subtle process.

If employers

are gradually replacing defined benefit coverage with 401(k) coverage, defined
benefit participation may decline ove~ time as employers offer only the 401(k)
plan to new employees.lz

Table 12 presents estimates of the effect of

changes in 401(k) and DC plan status on participation

plan.
The estimates in the second column of Table 12 indicate that adding a

6. CONCLUSION
This paper examines the changes in pension offerings and plan
participation

for sponsors that began with at least one DB plan in 1985.

Between 1985 and 1992, over 20 percent of ongoing sponsors dropped DB plans
entirely in favor of DC-type plans.

The econometric evidence indicates that

DB offerings are reduced when-a sponsor introduces either a 401(k) or other DC
plan.

That is, for ❑any ongoing sponsors, 401(k) and other DC-type plans are

replacing their traditional DB plan.

In addition, many of the “new” 401(k)

plans appear to be converted from DC plans without the pre-tax participant
contribution

feature.

The addition of a 401(k) plan is estimated to reduce the number of DB
plans by about 0.3 relative to a sponsor that offers no 401(k) or other DC
plan.

That is, one sponsor terminates a DB plan for about every three

sponsors that offer at least one new 401(k) plan.

In the sample, this effect

accounts for almost 18 percent of the DB plans lost to ongoing sponsors in the
panel and the DB loss affects four to five percent of all 1985 DB
participants.

Maintaining

the 401(k) offered in 1985 reduces the number of DB

plans by about 0.2.
Non-401(k) DC plans are also estimated to reduce DB plan offerings, and
the estimated effects are larger than those for 401(k) plans.
a DC plan reduces the number of DB plans offered by about 0.4.

The addition of
Maintaining

the existing DC leads to a termination of 0.26 of a DB plan.
Addition of a 401(k) plan also substantially increases the probability
that an accompanying DB plan will be terminated.

The point.estimates

indicate

that if a 401(k) plan is added by a sponsor, the DB termination probability
increases by about 18 percentage points to 35 percent.

23

The addition of a non-

401(k) plan similarly increases the probability

that a DB plan will be

terminated.
This evidence indicates that 401(k) plans are substituting for the
traditional DB and DC thrift/saving type plans among sponsors that have
offered DB plans in the past.

While the estimates are suggestive, there are

several important caveats to bear in ❑ind.

First, a change in the number or

type of plan offered does not necessarily change pension coverage.

It is

possible that sponsors are consolidating plans, and as mentioned above, a
limitation of this data is that it is not possible to track participants to
specific plans.

Further, a change in pension form, from DB to 401(k), has no

necessary effect on the amount of eventual retirement assets.

Third, for the twenty percent of employers who replaced all DB plans

The evidence presented does suggest, however, that not all the assets in
new 401(k) plans represent net saving.

401(k) assets may in part replace

saving that formerly took place in a DB plan or in an DC plan without 401(k)
features.
