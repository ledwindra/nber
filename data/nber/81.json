    "abstract": "\n\nIf the expenditure of resources in childhood affects the outcomes in adulthood, the adult distribution of education and incomes will depend at least partially on investments made in childhood. There is considerable variation in the amount of parental inputs children of various socio-economic statuses receive. In the empirical work that follows, we will show a relationship between very specific inputs of time by parents and later achievements of children.\n\n",
