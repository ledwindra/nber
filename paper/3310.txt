TENURE CHOICE OF AMERICAN YOUTH

ABSTRACT
While there seems to be no end to estimates of housing tenure
determinants, prior studies have not accounted for the simultaneity of tenure
choice with household formation, labor supply or the marriage decision. Our
estimates are superior to those in the literature both because we address these
issues and because we better measure the cost of owning relative to renting.
Accounting for simultaneity with the household formation and labor supply
decisions matter. Using a household's predicted wage rate rather than its
observed income doubles the response of tenure choice to the price of owning
relative to renting. Including household formation selectivity correction
variables cuts the response to tenure choice to the predicted wage by 25
percent. Moreover, the iapact of variations in demographic variables on tenure
choice is sharply reduced after correcting for selectivity bias.

I. INTRODUCTION
While there seems to be no end to estimates of housing tenure
determinants, prior studies have not accounted for the simultaneity of tenure

choice with household formation, labor supply or the marriage decision. Our
estimates are superior to those in the literature both because we address
these issues and because we better measure the cost of owning relative to

renting. The introductory comments expand on these points.
Although tenure studies of aggregate data purport to explain ownership
variation in response to social, economic, and demographic variables, these
studies (Rosen and Rosen, 1980; Hendershott and Shilling, 1982) actually

explain the ratio of two endogenous variables: the number of owners and total
households. Analogously, microeconomic studies of household tenure choice are
subject to selection bias because they limit their analysis to individuals who

have chosen to form a household (Rosen, 1979)) Because similar types of
variables (some unobserved) explain both choices we suspect that bias
resulting from ssmple selection could be substantial.

In our approach, we model the choices of whether to live with a parent
or not, and, having left the parental home, whether to live with a group or

not. The results of these estimations are then used to correct for potential
selectivity bias in our micro based study of tenure choice. This correction
is shown to be important in that one of the coefficients of the selection
correction variables is statistically significant in the tenure choice
equation and some coefficients in equations with and without the correction
differ substantially.

The jointness of the quantities of labor supply and housing demand is

shown in a study by Kohlhase (1986). One implication of this joint decision
is that tenure choice studies, nearly all of which have used income as an

2

explanatory variable, are subject to simultaneous equation bias because income

depends on endogenous labor supply. Rather than directly treating the
covariation of labor supply with household structure or mode of tenure, we use

the predicted wage rate (an exogenous variable). Again, we find statistically
different results when predicted wage is employed instead of predicted income.

A final source of bias in other studies of household formation is the

assumption that marital status is exogenous. The usual argument is that
married couples have a higher demand for privacy than singles, thus they

prefer to form separate households. However, the decision to marry may be
influenced by the cost of forming a household and therefore marriage and

living arrangement may be determined simultaneously. We estimate a reduced
form marital status equation on a set of demographic, economic, and
attitudinal variables and use the predicted value derived from the probit as a
measure of the respondent's demand for privacy.

Because of our emphasis on the cost of housing, we must pay particular

attention to the measurement of this variable. We explicitly consider the tax
treatment of households in different modes of tenure, and we append to our
survey additional data that describes (by city) the relative price of

constant-quality owned and rented housing. The resulting measures of the
price of ownership and renting by location are more detailed and spatially
comprehensive than are the price variables used in prior studies.

The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections. We first
describe the unique data set employed and the measurement of our key housing

price variable. We then report results, first for the decisions of whether or
not to leave the parental home and, for those who have left, whether or not to
"group up" or live as independent units and then the decision of whether to

own

or

rent. A concluding section summarizes the empirical results.

3

II. DATA
The basic data set is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).

Our focus in on 1987 when the respondents were aged 22 to 29. Included in the
survey is information describing a respondent's demographic characteristics
(age, gender and race), labor force and income experiences, attitudes, wealth,

and housing choices. From a possible sample size of 9851, we exclude youth
currently in college or living in institutions and youth residing in

localities for which we have no housing cost information. We also exclude
respondents living with partners because of problems in identifying home
ownership and wealth.

We append to the NLSY a description of federal and state tax codes and a

data set that indicates the cost of shelter in U.S. urban areas. The shelter
data from Coidwell Banker report, for 175 cities, the purchase cost and rental
equivalent of a "standard" 2000 square foot house with three bedrooms in

neighborhoods where corporate transferees would tend to locate.2 Also
included are measures of local property tax rates and the one year local house

price inflation rate. Although we must omit over half of the respondents
because their location is not one of those covered in the housing data, the
cost of shelter index that we use is substantially more spatially
comprehensive than is the American Housing Survey, the most frequently used
substitute.

To test the validity of the Coldwell Banker data, we compared the
derivad price index to a careful study of housing prices by Moulton (1989).
He forms alternative price indexes for rental costs from data that are

collected to create the CPI house price series. Comparing Moulton's preferred
rental index with the Coidwell Banker series in the 18 areas contained in

both, we find a correlation of 0.77. We conclude that the Coldwell Banker

4

data are consistent with alternative hedonic-based price series and are
superior in their spatial coverage.

The annual cost of owning relative to renting for household j in city s
can be expressed as:

(l-r)(i+S) -

C0ST —

it + 5

(R,/V)

(1)

where i is the pure financing rate (0.10), & is the maintenance and
depreciation rate (0.035), r and S are household specific tenure choice income
and property tax rates, and it and R/V are the city specific expected inflation

rate and rent/value ratio. The rent/value ratio and property tax rate come
directly from Coldwell Banker. Expected inflation is a weighted average of
the actual city house price inflation rate during the previous year (from
Coldwell Banker) and the national expected inflation rate (0.04), where the
local rate is given a 10 percent weight.

The tenure choice tax rate employed in the COST variable is computed
using the methodology of }Iendershott and Slemrod (1983). For a household of
income yJ, r3 depends upon exemptions, deductions, and federal tax rate

schedules. The number of dependents is contained in the data set, but we must
estimate the amount of deductible expenses. For owners, deductions include
state income taxes (derived from state tax tables), state sales taxes
(estimated from 1986 federal tax table guidelines), property taxes (based on

S and Vi), charitable contributions (assumed to equal one percent of y-), and
the mortgage interest deduction (based on the amount of housing debt and a

0.10 mortgage interest rate). The amount of the standard deduction for a
household is computed from federal tax regulations. To compute the tenure

S

choice tax rate, we evaluate:

— TAXR- TAX&

(2)

(i+O)V

where TAXR is the tax household j would pay if it rented snd TAXO if it
owned. For lower income households who would have much greater standard
deductions than itemized expenses if they rented, the tenure choice tax rate
can be much less than their marginal tax rate.3
The variation in the locational variables in the COST expression is

large: the rent-to-value ratio ranges from 0.055 to 0.13 with a mean of
0.087, local inflation varies from negative 0.21 to positive 0.27 with a 0.057

mean, and the property tax rate is as low as 0.005 and as high as 0052 with a
mean of 0.013. The mean value of COST is 0.9, and the regional variation in
any of the three variables is sufficient to cause COST to range from 0.70 to
1.10.

In the estimation of equations explaining in-or-out of parents' house
and group or separate living, we use a relative rent index computed as the
ratio of the Coldwell Banker rent on a standard house in the respondent's city
relative to the average rent on a standard house in all Coldwell-Banker

cities. This index varies from roughly 0.5 to 2.0.
Several additional explanatory variables were created for use in either

the household formation or tenure choice equations. Real income is often used
to measure the economic capacity to leave the parental home, live separately,

or purchase a home. However, labor supply, and thus income, are endogenous.
We employ instead a measure of predicted real wage and estimate its value for
the respondent and spouse (if present) using a tobit model.4

6

Other endogenous variables that may help to explain tenure choice are
wealth and whether or not the household is a married couple (aee Krumm, 1989,

on the endogeneity of wealth). For wealth, we use an instrument created by
regressing current household wealth on a vector of variables describing a

household's human capital and demographic characteristics. For the
probability of the respondent being married, we use the estimated value from a

probit model.5 (Results for both of these equations are available from the
authors.)

III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Our ultimate goal is to estimate the tenure choice of households in a
framework that accounts for their decision to be a separate household (defined

as living away from parents and not in a group). We adopt a two stage
selection correction procedure similar to the model of Behrman and Wolfe

(1984). In the first stage, a bivariate probit model with partial
ohservability is estimated. The choice variables are being in-or-out of the
parent's home and living with a group or separately. Selection correction
variables are generated and used in a second stage analysis of tenure choice.
Household Formations

The tendency to live outside of the parent's home can be described by:

Ii —

Xfl1

+

6li'

(3)

and the tendency to live with a separate (non-group) household by:

1i —

i2

+

62i

(4)

We assume that 6li' 62i are iid and are standard bivariate normal

correlation

coefficient p. Neither Ii nor

with

is observed; rather,

'ii

I

if I. > 0,

— 0 if I'.< 0
Ii—

12i 1 if i>O, it is observed if 'li—i

—0 if I

0, it is observed if 'li—i

— unobserved if

— 0.

That is, we always observe whether individusls are in-or-out of their parents'
home; however, if they remain with their parents, we do not observe their
choice of whether to live with a group of other adults.

This model is discussed in detail by Meng and Schmidt (1985), and the

log of the likelihood function is listed on their page 74. The selection
correction variables are derived in Maddala (1986, p. 368) for the bivariate

probit model. In our sample, the estimated value for p was not significantly
different from zero; thus we adopt the simpler framework attained by assuming
p—O.6 We then enter the two selection correction variables (LAMBDA-PARENT,
LAMBDA-GROUP) in the analysis of tenure choice (Maddala, p. 282).

The number of households is greater the less is "doubling up". Doubling
up takes two forms: young adults remaining in (or returning to) the home of
their parents, and individuals or married couples outside the parental home

forming group living arrangements. Table 1 reports, by age, the proportions
of youth who live out of their parents' home (rising from 62% to 89%) and the
proportions of individuals (rising from 44% to 73%) and married couples (91%
to 97%) outside their parental home that live alone.

8

We present the household formation estimation results of equations (3)

and (4) in Tables 2 and 3. Whether a youth resides with his or her parents
depends on numerous factors. In part, normal maturation will lead to
separation from parents. However, what is normal is apparently different for
females and males; young males (25.5) are more likely than young females to
remain in the parental household, while older males are less likely.
Moreover, the more children one has, the more likely one is to be out of the
parental home. But the economic feasibility of living outside the parents'

home is also important. The greater is one's wealth and especially the
greater is one's predicted wage rate (husband and wife, if married), the more

likely is one to be living outside the parental home. Conversely, the highet
is the cost of independent living (rent), the less likely is one to be outside
the parental home.

The most important determinants of whether or not individuals and
married couples "group up" are the number of their children, their gender and

race, and their predicted wealth and wage. Females and blacks are more likely
to live aeparately, as are those with children. Moreover, the higher are
predicted wealth and wages, the greater is the probability of separate living.
Tenure Choice
We limit our analysis of tenure choice to the 1565 respondents who are
outside the parental home and not living with others than their spouses and

children. Analysis of group tenure choice is not possible owing to lack of
data on those in the group other than the respondent. Table 4 reports the
otmerahip rate of all youth, for youth who live outside the parents' house,

and for youth who do not live in groups. Among all youth, the percentage that
are owners rises rapidly from 14 to 50 in just eight years. The ownership
rate is obviously higher when we limit the reference group to youth who reside
outside their parents' home (by about 6 percentage points) or to youth who do
mot live with groups (by about 10 percentage points).

9

We hypothesize that the basic economic determinants of ownership are
potential earnings, wealth and the cost of owning relative to renting.7
Assuming privacy to be a superior good and that owned units are more private
than rentals, increases in potential earnings will raise the desire for

ownership. An increased capacity to earn income may also lessen affordability
constraints on ownership (Kearl, 1979). On the other hand, increases in
wealth will raise ownership by reducing the risk premium required on
investment in housing and lessening the impact of the downpayment constraint

(Linneman and Wachter 1989, Zorn 1989). We also include the percentage of
household income that is from transfer payments such as alimony, child

support, and governnent welfare as an explanatory variable. These sources may
be considered unstable by lenders, resulting in their implicit or explicit

discounting of such income when considering the maximum size home loan to
extend.

Noneconomic variables included in our probit equation include the

demographic variables and the number of the respondent's children. Of all the
variables tested, only predicted wealth and a variable indicating single male

headship were not statistically significant. The probit estimates are in
Table 5; to provide an indication of the relative magnitudes of the response

of tenure choice, Table 6 has been constructed. In this table, all variables
are initially set at their sample means (listed in the appendix tables) and
then varied one at a time so that we can see how the probabilities differ at
ages 22 and 29, for males and females, at low and high relative owner-renter

cost, etc. The estimated probabilities of ownership when all variables are
assigned their sample means is 34 percent.
The age, race and female head variables work as prior research would

suggest (e.g., Blackley and Follain, 1988). Holding housing costs and
predicted wages and wealth constant, the probability of ownership is 25
percentage points higher for households age 29 than for those age 22, is 14

10

percentage points higher for whites than blacks, and is 8 points higher for
households headed by single males than single females.8
Further, the observed sample variations in the relative cost and
predicted wage variables suggest substantial variation in tenure

probabilities. In areas where the relative cost of ownership is high; the
probability of ownership is 15 percentage points less than in low cost areas,
and the probability of ownership is 24 percentage points greater for those
with predicted wages twice the sample mean than for those with half the mean.
Finally, if the percent of income coming from transfer payments rises to 20

percent from zero, ownership falls by 11 percentage points. This result is
consistent with Hsurin's 1988 finding that ownership and the percentage of
income that is uncertain are negatively related.

Table 7 provides wage and cost elasticities of ownership for blacks and

whites in different household structures. For married households, the wage
elasticity is roughly 0.75 and the cost is -0.8, with the black elasticities

being slightly larger in absolute value. These elasticities are generally

consistent with other cross-sectional work (e.g., Rosen, l979). For single
households, the wage elasticities are noticeably higher for females than for

males and for whites than for blacks. On the other hand, the absolute values
of the price elasticities are sharply higher for singles than for marrieds
(2.0 to 2.8 versus 0.7 to 1.1).

A variety of alternative probit equations have been estimated to

illustrate the importance of accounting for endogeneity and selectivity. The
coefficients (and t-ratios) for the relative owner-renter cost and the income

or wage variables are listed in Table 8. The first three sets of coefficients
are from equations including observed income, predicted income, and predicted

wages, respectively, but not the selectivity correction variables. The last
set is from an equation using predicted wage and including selectivity

correction variables (repeats the estimates in Table 5). Going from left to

i-i.

right,

observed income is very significant, but the relative cost variable

barely works. When predicted income is used, the relative cost coefficient
more than doubles, but income is no longer statistically significant.

However, the predicted wage variable is significant when it

replaces

predicted

income, and the relative cost coefficient declines only slightly. Finally,
adding the selectivity correction variables does not affect the cost
coefficient, but it does reduce the wage coefficient by one fourth.

Making the selectivity adjustment has impacts beyond lowering the wage

estimates. More specifically, the estimated responses to the demographic
variables are sharply lower. The coefficients for children, single male head,
single female head, and age, respectively, are 44, 57, 22 and 11 percent less
than when the selectivity adjustment is not made.

IV.

SUMMARY

We have explained the decisions of American youth to live apart from

parents, to live alone or with unrelated adults, and to purchase a house for

occupation. The first two decisions need to be analyzed in order that tenure
estimates free of selectivity bias can be obtained. Tenure is importantly
affected by demographic variables, rising with age and being more likely for
married couples, for adults with children and for white households, ceteris

paribus. However, the demographic variables are significantly less important
after correction for selectivity bias than before.

Economic variables also matter greatly. Homeownership is significantly
greater in areas with low costs of owning relative to renting (areas having
low house prices relative to rents) and is greater the larger is a household's

predicted real wage. (Real rent and wage also significantly influences when
youth leave their parental home.) These responses vary with race and
household structure. For married households, the wage elasticity is roughly
0.75 and the cost elasticity is -0.8 with the black elasticities being

slightly larger in absolute value. For single households, the wage

12

elasticities are noticeably higher for females than for males and for whites

than for blacks. On the other hand, the absolute values of the price
elasticities are sharply higher for singles than for marrieds (2.0 to 2.8

versus 0.7 to 1.1). Using predicted wage rather than predicted or observed
income affects these results importantly. With observed income, the cost
responses are only about half as large; with predicted income, the income
response is not statistically significant.

Footnotes

1. An exception is Borsch-Supan (1986) who estimated a nested logit model
that allowed both household structure and tenure to be choice variables.

2. The data are derived from the judgment of real estate brokers and the
actual sales of comparable houses. This method is similar to that used by
real estate tax appraisers. Use of the American Housing Survey would severely
limit the spatial scope of' our study, and the hedonic price method would have

to be used to calculate costs for a standardized home.

3. All of the empirical literature cited in this paper, except Haurin,
Hendershott and Ling (1988), have used marginal rather than tenure choice tax

rates. For current renters, we first estimate the amount of housing that they
would have consumed if they had owned and then use equations (2) and (1) to

calculate COST. The reduced from housing consumption equation is corrected
for the selection bias that is introduced by only using a sample of owners
(results are available from the authors). In the calculation of the amount of
itemized deductions renters would have had if they had selected ownership, we
aaaume a loan-to-value ratio of 0.90.
4. Explanatory variables for the respondent's real wage equation include age,
age squared, race, gender, education, education squared, measures of health

limitations, job experience, job training, and an achievement test score. To
control for spatial variation in nominal wages, we include the size of the

local labor force and the population density of county of residence. The
explanatory variables in the spouse wage equation are more limited because of

less detail in the data set. Results for both estimations are available from
the authors.

5. Explanatory variables include age, gender, race, predicted real wage,
whether sexual intercourse occurred before age 16, interactions of these
variables, the desired number of children, various measures of aelf esteem,
and the real rent of a constant-quality unit in the city in which the
respondent resides.

The coefficient estimates obtained by assuming p — 0 are nearly identical

to those estimated with the bivsriate probit.
7.

See Hsurin, Hendershott snd Ling (1988) for a formal derivation from

utility maximizing behavior.

8. We have argued elsewhere that some of the age impact reflects the lesser
expected mobility of older households and the lower ownership costs (smaller
annual equivslent transaction cost) associated with reduced mobility (Haurin,
Hendershott and Ling, 1988).

9. The price elasticities are far higher (in sbsolute value) than those
obtained in time series studies. In esrlier work we provided evidence that
the high cross-section estimates are inconsistent with the observed time
series behavior of homeownership rate (Haurin, Hendershott and Ling, 1988).
