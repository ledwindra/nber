ABSTRACT
This study examines whether pre-crisis international reserve accumulations, as well as exchange rate
and reserve policy decisions made during the global financial crisis, can help to explain cross-country
differences in post-crisis economic performance. Our approach focuses not only on the total stock
of official reserves held by countries, but also on the decisions by governments to purchase or sell
reserve assets during the crisis period. We introduce new data made available through the IMF Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) Reserve Template, which allow us to distinguish interest income
and valuation changes in the stock of official reserves from the actively managed component of reserves.
We use this novel data to gauge how (and whether) reserve accumulation policies influenced the economic
and financial performance of countries during and after the global crisis. Our findings support the
view that higher reserve accumulations prior to the crisis are associated with higher post-crisis GDP
growth.

1. Introduction
The global financial crisis wreaked havoc on world markets and has led to major
economic dislocation around the world. Initially it was the developed countries that bore the
brunt of the crisis, but by mid-2008 the crisis was global; financing for emerging markets dried
up and credit spreads for emerging market debt rose dramatically, raising concerns about their
ability to refinance their debt. After the Lehman Brother’s collapse in September 2008, many
trade-oriented countries saw exports plunge leading to sharp contractions of GDP. Countries
with high levels of debt were also hard hit, with many countries forced to allow their currency to
depreciate and/or draw down their foreign currency reserves. The governments of countries with
exceptionally large banking sectors took over their liquidity-strapped banks, converting private
sector debts to public sector debts. Some countries were hit more strongly by the crisis
(especially in Central and Eastern Europe) while others, at least initially, appeared more
shielded. Many of these emerging market countries had accumulated impressive stocks of
international reserves prior to the global crisis. This paper examines whether these pre-crisis
international reserve accumulations, as well as exchange rate and reserve policy decisions made
during the crisis, can help to explain cross-country differences in post-crisis economic
performance.
We begin with an analysis of initial conditions in order to better understand the choices
countries faced when the global crisis struck. An important component of this analysis focuses
on pre-crisis international reserve accumulation. In the years since the regional crises in the
1990s a number of countries, especially in East Asia, were thought to have built up excessive
international reserve portfolios. If the main rationale for accumulating reserves was to provide
precautionary self-insurance, the global financial crisis would seem to be the ultimate vindication
for that strategy. Yet recent studies by Blanchard, Faruqee and Das (2010) and Aizenman and
Sun (2010) find that even countries with high levels of reserves were reluctant to use (or lose)
them. They find little evidence that reserves were important buffers to the crisis.
Our analysis reexamines the findings and interpretations in the literature about the role of
reserves during crises. First, we argue that the decision by governments not to deplete reserves
during the crisis does not necessarily provide evidence against the positive role for reserves in
self-insurance. Indeed, high reserve stocks prior to the crisis may have protected countries
against speculative attacks, which would require drawing down reserves, and which would have
otherwise occurred. Reserves in this context may be analogous to the lender of last resort
facilities in central banks. Second, our graphical analysis of country-by-country reserve changes
suggests that one has to be careful in defining the timing of crises, which are likely to differ
across countries. The range of currency and reserve defense strategies used by countries is lost in
1

the regressions reported in the current literature which generally use the same crisis timing for all
countries.
The derivation of optimal reserve levels has long been contentious. Recent experience
suggests that models have underestimated the threshold level of reserves after which risk
perceptions about a country rise non-linearly and dramatically. Further, the widely differing
levels of reserve stocks held by emerging countries indicate significant heterogeneity in desired
threshold levels (perhaps based on past experience during crises as Hashimoto and Ito (2007)
emphasize). More importantly, recent evidence suggests that once reserves fall below the
threshold, net new capital inflows abruptly end, leading to debt rollover problems and capital
flight. These capital flow reversals can, in turn, increase the pace of reserve depletion. South
Korea through the current crisis is a case in point. In 2008 there was concern that Korea’s total
external debt maturing over the coming year would exceed its level of international reserves.
Korean officials were also concerned about their losses due to the unwinding of currency hedges
for canceled export orders. In addition to depleting some of its reserves, Korean authorities opted
to draw on their swap line with the Fed in the midst of the crisis in order not to breach their
perceived threshold level of reserves.
Our approach focuses not only on the total stock of official reserves held by countries,
but also on the decisions by governments to purchase or sell reserve assets during the crisis
period. We introduce new data made available through the IMF Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) Reserve Template, which allow us to distinguish interest income and valuation
changes in the stock of official reserves from the actively managed component of reserves. We
use this novel data to gage how (and whether) reserve accumulation policies influenced the
economic and financial performance of countries during and after the global crisis.
2. Why Do Countries Hold International Reserves?
International reserves held by monetary authorities (typically in the Central Bank,
Treasury, or Ministry of Finance) are part of national wealth, and were originally important for
countries with fixed exchange rates that wanted to avoid costly adjustments to disturbances in the
external sector of the economy. For a country with fixed exchange rates, international reserves
are a necessary buffer to maintain the regime. However, in this view of reserves, if a country
moves away from a fixed exchange rate regime, it is less clear how much of a share of the
national wealth should be devoted to international reserve assets. It is worth noting that when
monetary authorities acquire international reserves they typically sterilize the effect of these
purchases on the domestic monetary base by incurring domestic-currency liabilities (often

2

termed “sterilization bonds”).1 Likewise, reserves held by the fiscal authority are typically
financed with domestic government bills. Hence, international reserves in most countries are not
net national assets. If the interest rate on reserve assets is lower than the domestic interest rate,
holding reserves incurs quasi-fiscal costs. Countries with large stocks of international reserves
and a high domestic interest rate may inadvertently be counter-parties to the carry trade. While
carry-traders borrow in low interest currencies and invest in high interest currencies, most
reserve building countries invest in low interest foreign currencies and borrow at the (relatively
higher) domestic interest rate.2 Countries with domestic interest rates that are lower than the
interest rate on reserve assets (e.g., Japan) benefit from net interest income on reserves; in this
case reserve accumulation can be regarded as a form of public carry-trade. Holding reserves also
exposes the country to currency risk. If the domestic currency appreciates vis-à-vis the currencies
denominating the reserve assets, the domestic currency value of reserves drops. These valuation
risks can, at least in theory, be mitigated if the reserve assets are diversified.
Countries accumulate reserves for precautionary purposes against current and capital
account shocks and as a byproduct of intervention strategies to keep the international value of the
domestic currency stable and low in order to boost export growth (Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and
Garber (2003)).3 There have been a number of recent empirical studies attempting to test
whether the precautionary or exchange rate stability motive better explains international reserve
accumulations by both industrialized and developing countries. These studies generally find
evidence in support of both motivations (see, for example, Aizenman and Lee (2007)), while at
the same time finding that neither motivation fully explains the upsurge in reserve accumulations
by developing countries starting in 2000 (Jeanne (2007) and Jeanne and Ranciere (2007)). Three
recent studies that come to the conclusion that reserve accumulations through 2007 were not
excessive include: Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2010) who gage reserve adequacy against
the size of the banking sector, Hashimoto and Ito (2007) who focus on the adequacy of reserves
to maintain exchange rate stability, and Dominguez (2010) who focuses on the role for reserves
in countries with underdeveloped financial markets.
1
If the central bank does not sterilize its foreign reserve purchases it increases its domestic liabilities when
its foreign assets increase. If the central bank sterilizes, it effectively reduces its net assets. In both cases the net
worth of the central bank is unchanged.
2
A conspicuous exception to this is the case of Japan, and possibly China. The interest rate of Japan’s
fiscal bills that have been issued to maintain foreign reserves is markedly lower than the US Treasury interest rate.
The special account of the foreign exchange fund managed by the Japanese Ministry of Finance has recorded net
interest gains in the last 20 years. See Ito (2003, 2007a) for details of the balance sheet of the account, and interest
income. This suggests that Japanese foreign reserve operations are essentially engaged in carry-trade, pursuing net
interest income with exposure to currency risk.
3
There is a large literature exploring the motivation for and efficacy of foreign exchange intervention
policy in developed countries (see, for example, Adams and Henderson (1983), Dominguez and Frankel (1993),
Dominguez (2006b), Ito (2003, 2004, 2005 and 2007b) and Ito and Yabu (2007)). The efficacy of intervention
policies in developing countries has been less widely studied, in large part because governments have been reluctant
to provide detailed data on their operations. Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) document the extent to which the
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves has been sterilized by developing countries since 1990.

3

There are also a few studies that examine reserve policy during the most recent global
crisis. Aizenman and Sun (2010) document that many emerging market countries chose not to
deplete their international reserves as part of the adjustment mechanism. Further, they find that
the main factor distinguishing countries that did rely on reserves was their heavy trade
orientation (measured with trade-openness, oil export share and commodity export ratios). They
suggest that these countries were less wary of depleting reserves when export markets collapsed,
while most other countries opted for adjustment via exchange rate depreciation rather than
reserve depletion.4 Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2009) and Aizenman, Jinjarak and Park
(2011) document the heavy reliance on swap lines of inter-governmental credit during the crisis,
especially by developed countries that did not have large reserve accumulations. They suggest
that swap lines may substitute for reserves for some countries.5
Precautionary and exchange rate stability motives for reserve accumulation may have
been importantly connected for some countries in the pre-global crisis period, and may have
contributed to the global imbalances that are often cited as playing a causal role in the global
crisis. Countries that experienced crises and decumulation of reserves in the late 1990s were in
the process of rebuilding reserves in the years prior to the global crisis. Reserve accumulation by
these countries will have put downward pressure on their own currencies and contributed to
external surpluses.
3. Measurement of International Reserves
The term “international reserves” is not used consistently in the literature. The assets held by
governments and monetary authorities for reserve purposes are interchangeably called “foreign
reserves,” “official reserves,” or “international reserves;” even government publications often
use different labels to describe the same category of assets. In this paper we stick to the naming
conventions used by the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) Reserve template.
Total official reserves (IR) are the broadest definition of international reserves. This
concept includes foreign currency reserves (ForexR) and non-currency reserves, which include
monetary gold (Gold), Special Drawing Rights (SDR), the reserve position at the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and other reserve assets (Other). Foreign currency reserves (ForexR), in
4
In the context of the mercantilist versus precautionary motives, we should expect a mercantilist country
to prefer depreciation over foreign reserve depletion. Indeed the motivation to accumulate reserves for mercantilists
is to prevent appreciation when experiencing capital inflows. At the same time, mercantilist countries should be
delighted to allow the exchange rate to depreciate when experiencing capital outflows. On the other hand, a country
motivated by precaution should prefer to deplete foreign reserves in the face of capital outflows in order to preserve
exchange rate stability. The precautionary motive should lead countries to accumulate reserves during times of
capital inflows in order that they are available for use during times of capital outflow.

As we will describe in more detail in section 3, it is important to recognize that swap lines that are drawn
upon are part of a country’s international reserves.

turn, consist of two categories of financial assets, securities (SEC) and currencies and deposits
(DEPO). In equations:
(3.1)
(3.2)

IR = ForexR + Gold + SDR + IMF + Other
ForexR = SEC + DEPO

The securities (SEC) and currencies and deposits (DEPO) component of official reserves reflect
foreign reserve policy actions, including foreign exchange market intervention and reserve
portfolio management (involving shifts between currency denomination and asset maturities).
Our analysis in the next section focuses on the details of foreign reserve policy actions reflected
in changes in ForexR. Other reserve assets (Other) consist of financial derivatives, loans to
nonbank nonresidents and others, which generally make up a very small share of official
reserves.6
Cross-country data are available for IR, ForexR, Gold, SDRs, IMF reserves, and Other,
so that it is possible to measure each component in equation (3.1). The one reserve component
that is not available is the breakdown of assets between securities and deposits (SEC and DEPO)
in the foreign currency component of reserves (ForexR). In this study we therefore focus on a
new source of data provided through the SDDS in the Reserve Template which provides data on
all these categories of reserves, including the breakdown of SEC and DEPO.
While the definition of official reserves seems straight forward, the details regarding
what assets should be included or excluded has evolved over time. Conceptually international
reserves should be denominated in foreign currency, owned by the government or monetary
authority, and should be highly liquid.7 Reserves held at the IMF, both a country’s “reserve
tranche” as well as IMF loans, are included8, as are certain assets held in special purpose
6

The average share of ‘other’ in IR for the SDDS countries is 2.84% and the median is .04%; for 80% of
the countries in the sample the share is between 0 and 3%. The country with the largest share (45%) of ‘other’ is
South Africa between 2003 and 2005, followed by Norway in 2003-4 and New Zealand in 2006. The financial
derivatives component of ‘other’ is zero for most countries; the average share of financial derivatives in IR is .05%.
7
According to the sixth edition of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6), a country’s international
reserve assets refer to “those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for
meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such
as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy, and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). Reserve
assets must be foreign currency assets and assets that actually exist.” (Chapter 6, 6.64; p.111) In the case of the
United States, international reserves are held in the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) and the Federal
Reserve's System Open Market Account (SOMA). Among the SDDS compliant countries Argentina, Belgium,
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Spain and the UK separately report reserves held by the central government
(CG) and the monetary authority (MA).
8
A country’s “reserve position in the IMF is the sum of (a) the “reserve tranche,” that is, the foreign
currency (including SDRs) amounts that a member country may draw from the IMF at short notice; and (b) any
indebtedness of the IMF (under a loan agreement) in the General Resources Account that is readily available to the
member country, including the reporting country’s lending to the IMF under the General Arrangements to Borrow
(GAB) and the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). While a member country must present a declaration of
balance of payments–related need to make a purchase in the reserve tranche (reduction in reserve position), the IMF
does not challenge a member’s request for reserve tranche purchases” BPM6 (Chapter 6, 6.85; pp. 114).

government funds (often termed Sovereign Wealth funds, SWFs)9 and assets created under
reciprocal facilities (swap arrangements)10. There is an interesting historical progression between
how countries measured reserves in the 1990s (before and during crises) and how the IMF
responded with new restrictions on these funds. Appendix A provides some of these countryspecific examples.
Some SWF assets, including assets managed by Singapore’s Government Investment
Corporation (GIC), are included in the country’s international reserves, since the corporation is
designated as a manager of international reserves. However, the assets in Singapore’s
TEMASEC, another SWF, are not included in the country’s international reserves, since these
assets include equities and other illiquid assets. Assets in the Chinese sovereign wealth fund,
CIC, are most likely not in Chinese international reserves, as they were created to diversify
international reserves, mostly US Treasury bonds, into high-risk, high-return assets, such as
stakes in financial institutions and alternative assets, which would not qualify as international
reserves.
In response to concerns in both the financial markets and by creditor governments to
perceived problems with international reserve measurement as well as the reliability of other key
macroeconomic variables, the IMF launched the SDDS in April 1996 in an effort to guide
countries in the collection and timely publication of economic and financial data, including
international reserves data.11 Nevertheless during the Asian financial crisis proper disclosure of
international reserves became an issue for the affected governments. By June 1997 forty-one
countries, including all of the crisis-hit Asian countries—Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and

9

“Assets held in special purpose government funds that meet the definition of reserve assets are classified
within reserve assets depending on their nature. So, if the special purpose government funds hold deposits,
securities, and other reserve assets, these are classified as such within reserve assets. Assets held in a resident special
purpose government fund that are claims on nonresidents but do not meet the criteria to be classified as reserve
assets are classified in the financial account and IIP under the appropriate instrument and functional category. If
special purpose government funds own direct investment equity and debt securities that could be classified in either
direct investment or reserves assets, as general guidance, in the hierarchy of the balance of payments and IIP
between direct investment and reserve assets, the equity securities should be classified as direct investment ahead of
reserve assets, and debt securities should be classified as reserve assets ahead of direct investment” BPM6 (Chapter
6, 6.98; pp. 116).
10
“Assets created under reciprocal facilities (swap arrangements) for the temporary exchange of deposits
between the central banks of two economies warrant mention. Deposits (in foreign exchange) acquired by the central
bank initiating the arrangement are treated as reserve assets because the exchange provides the central bank with
assets that can be used to meet the economy’s balance of payments financing needs and other related purposes.
Reciprocal deposits acquired by the partner central bank also are considered reserve assets, as long as they meet the
general criteria for being reserve assets, if they are denominated and settled in a convertible currency. Lines of credit
that could be drawn on and foreign exchange resources that could be obtained under swap agreements are not
reserve assets because they do not constitute existing claims” BPM6 (Chapter 6, 6.102; pp. 117).
11
The SDDS is one of the IMF’s Data Dissemination Standards initiatives and subscription is voluntary. It
prescribes the coverage, periodicity (frequency), and timeliness of 18 data categories for the four sectors (real,
financial, fiscal, and external sectors) of the economy. The data dissemination practice of the SDDS subscribers is
monitored by the IMF and the countries receive a monthly report (which is not published) and an annual report
(which is posted on the IMF website). In 1997 the IMF announced a second set of more generalized standards, the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

6

Korea—had subscribed to the SDDS.12 However, governments in the midst of crisis were
reluctant to fully disclose financial information. Complicated questions arose over the
composition and location of international reserve assets, as well as timeliness of data publication.
The selective dissemination of data, which did not deviate from any standards at the time, seems
to have been motivated by a desire on the part of governments to exaggerate usable, net (spotforward consolidated) international reserves. (See Appendix A for details on the relationship
between the Mexican and Asian currency crises and data transparency promoted by the IMF.)
In response to the post-Asia crisis data issues, particularly the need for more transparent
reserve data, the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity
(known as the Reserve Template) was approved at the Executive Board Meeting in 1998.13
Initially the SDDS only required countries to provide international reserve information on a
gross basis, though information on reserve-related liabilities was also encouraged. When the
Reserve Template became effective, SDDS subscribers were required to provide detailed
monthly reserve data by asset class (gold, SDRs, currency and deposits, securities, financial
derivatives)14 and location (reserves held in other national banks, BIS, IMF, or domestic and
foreign commercial banks)15 as well as detailed information on reserve-related liabilities.
It is worth noting that outside of crisis periods countries with large reserve accumulations
may have incentives to “understate” reserves, in an attempt to deflect criticism of mercantilist
motives and excessive reserves. Another consequence of the large accumulations of reserves in
emerging countries is a new consciousness among monetary authorities of the risk of
international reserve valuation losses16 as well as criticism from the US concerning excessive
official holdings of dollar-denominated assets. In order to avoid these economic and political
costs a number of countries with large reserve stocks have begun to pursue strategies that
diversify their reserve holdings17 and create new fund categories. Although these funds are often
12

The first few years, April 1996 through December 31, 1998, were regarded as a formal transition period
for the implementation of the SDDS, and a member “could subscribe to the SDDS even if its dissemination practices
were not fully in line with the SDDS at that time” (Alexander 2008, p.10).
13
During the Asian crisis, it was recognized that “the available data on the international reserves at that
time did not give a complete or timely picture of the liquidity constraints some countries faced during 1997.”
(Footnote 6 of page 11, Second Review of the Special Data Dissemination Standard, IMF, December 2, 1998.
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/dsbb/1998/120298.pdf).
14
In economies in which extensive reserve assets are held outside of the central bank, supplementary
information is required on the institutional sector of holdings of those reserve assets (only external claims actually
owned by the monetary authorities can be classified as reserves assets).
15
The Reserve Template has four parts: I. Official Reserve Assets and Other Foreign Currency Assets; II.
Predetermined Short-term Net Drains on Foreign Currency Assets; III Contingent Short-Term net Drains on Foreign
Currency Assets; and IV. Memorandum Items. Part I of the Reserve Template, official reserve assets, shows the
total amount of official reserve assets disaggregated into (1) foreign currency reserves, (2) IMF reserve position, (3)
SDRs, (4) gold, and (5) other reserve assets. Data on official reserve assets and the Reserve Template for the SDDS
subscribers are publicly available at the IMF’s website, http://dsbb.imf.org/Pages/SDDS/ReserveTemplates.aspx.
16
Dominguez, Fatum and Vacek (forthcoming) examine the implications of systematic reserve
decumulation (intended to mitigate valuation losses) on domestic currency movements.
17
The dollar remains the dominant currency denomination for reserves, though there is some evidence that
countries have begun to diversify into euro and yen, see Dominguez (1999, 2006a).

7

not officially defined as international reserves under IMF (BPM6) rules18, nonetheless they could
be used in times of crisis. Table 1 provides information on selected sovereign wealth funds
(SWFs), detailing which countries with SWFs subscribe to the SDDS or participate in the
GDDS, and whether SWF data are in BOP/IIP as of 2007 or 2010.
Swap arrangements between central banks are included in the Reserve Template (they are
generally recorded as financial derivatives in Section II.2 of the Reserve Template, and if they
are re-lent to commercial banks they are recorded in Section I.B).19 One of the U.S. Federal
Reserve policy responses to the global financial crisis was to provide liquidity to the interbank
dollar market in December 2007. The Fed simultaneously established the Term Auction Facility
(TAF), which provided funding to US banks, and reciprocal currency arrangements (known as
“swap lines”), which provided funding to the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss
National Bank (SNB). The list of central banks to which swap lines were extended was
expanded in September 2008 to include the central banks of Japan, England, Canada, Australia,
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway; and in October 2008 to New Zealand, Korea, Brazil, Singapore,
and Mexico. The addition of the last four countries on the list was an unusual move in that these
countries are regarded as emerging rather than advanced countries. The Fed swap arrangement
allowed Mexico and Korea to temporarily replenish their foreign reserve stocks. It is interesting
that it was the Federal Reserve, and not the IMF, that provided dollar liquidity to these four
countries. It might also be considered controversial that only these four emerging market
countries were offered swap lines.20 Each swap line was originally due to expire in several
months, they were later extended and finally expired in February 2010. The swap lines offered to
the ECB (originally $20 billion), SNB (originally $4 billion), Bank of England (originally $40
billion), and Bank of Japan (originally $60 billion) were uncapped (these banks could ask for any
dollar amount) in October 2008.
Through these swap arrangements foreign central banks were able to obtain US dollars in
exchange for their own currency with an agreement to reverse the transaction at a future date.
The foreign central banks in turn provided dollar liquidity to commercial banks in their
respective countries (Fleming and Klagge (2010) and Goldberg, Kennedy, and Miu (2011)

18

SWFs could be defined as reserves if they allow “the monetary authorities control over the disposition of
funds” BPM6 (Chapter 6, 6.95; pp. 115-116).
19
The Fed does not include the ‘mirror-image’ of the swaps in their SDDS data (though they do appear in
the BOP data), with the view that because the swaps are of short duration (3 months), and many of the currencies
received are not highly liquid, they do not really ‘count’ as reserves. There seems also to be wide variation in the
approach taken by countries that drew on swap lines, in terms of where these appear in the Reserve Template.
Receipts of foreign currencies due to the swap transactions may be recorded in some categories of the reserve
template Section I.A. (which is the data we use in our analysis), but in which exact category they are recorded seems
to depend on the country.
20
At least one other Asian country requested, but was denied, a swap line with the Federal Reserve.

provide details on the Fed swap facilities established during the financial crisis).21 The Federal
Reserve swap lines were drawn heavily, most notably by the ECB, the BOE, and the BOJ,
between September 2008 and December 2008, when the total of outstanding swap amounts
reached $543 billion, as shown in Table 2. Not all central banks used the established swap
lines.22
In order to understand the role of swap lines in the reserve data it is instructive to
consider the case of South Korea. The Bank of Korea faced severe exchange market (outflow)
pressure in the fall of 2008. News reports indicate that the Fed swap line (up to $30 billion)
helped to calm investor concerns with Korea, especially when the swap line expiration date was
extended (from April 30 to October 30, 2009) in February 2008. Later, on June 25, it was
announced that the expiration date was further pushed back to February 1, 2010. Consequently,
for countries like Korea who had access to Fed swap lines from October 2008 to February 2010,
stocks of foreign reserves (which include swap lines which are actually drawn23) were
temporarily inflated.
In addition to the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of England and the Swiss National
Bank provided the liquidity in Euro, British Pounds and Swiss Francs to other central banks
during the global financial crisis. The swap lines established by the ECB to central banks of
Hungary, Iceland, Denmark, and Poland seem to have been effective as they were heavily drawn
upon (Aizenman, et al. (2011)). Although the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) also provided
swap lines to the central banks of Argentina, Belarus, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, and
Malaysia, these swap lines served a different purpose. The Chinese yuan is not a convertible
currency and the Yuan was not part of the international liquidity shortage. The extension of these
swap lines was motivated by the PBoC’s desire to make the Yuan more “international” and to
help trade finance rather than to address any Yuan liquidity shortage, which was a moot issue
(Ito (2011).
Country holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are also included in international
reserves. For many countries, especially advanced countries with relatively small international
reserve positions, SDR fluctuations can be quite important. A nation's IMF quota, the maximum
amount of financial resources that it is obligated to contribute to the fund, determines its
allotment of SDRs. The SDR is neither a currency, nor a claim on the IMF, it is a potential claim
on the freely usable currencies of IMF members. Holders of SDRs can obtain these currencies in
exchange for their SDRs either through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between
21

Initially, the Fed funded the dollar swap lines by reducing its holdings of Treasury securities, though as
its various liquidity facilities grew, the Fed eventually allowed its liabilities to increase. In December 2008 there
were $580 billion in swaps outstanding, which accounted for over 25 percent of the Fed’s total assets.

members or, in some cases, by the IMF designating members with strong external positions to
purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions. It is in this way that SDRs are
transferred among IMF countries. General allocations of SDRs are based on long-term global
needs to supplement existing reserve assets and have been made only three times, in 1970-72, in
1979-81, and in 2009.24 The most recent allocation was made to help mitigate the effects of the
financial crisis and to enable all members of the IMF to participate in the SDR system on an
equitable basis. The 2009 allocation corrected for the fact that countries that joined the IMF
after 1981—more than one fifth of the current IMF membership— had never received an SDR
allocation. Figure 1 shows the importance of specific components of international reserves:
Figure 1a shows the 2009 SDR allocations for the U.S. Reserve Template and Figure 1b shows
the impact of IMF loans in 2008 and 2009 for the Iceland Reserve Template.

4. Measuring Reserve Changes
Worldwide international reserves increased dramatically in the years prior to the onset of the
global financial crisis. Figure 2 indicates that rapid reserve accumulation was most dramatic in
the economies of developing Asia, and to a lesser extent developing Europe, the Middle East and
North Africa. As of the end of 2010, the top four reserve holding countries are China, Japan,
Saudi Arabia, and Russia.

Official Reserves grow as a result of: (1) purchases of foreign currency reserve assets, (2) the
receipt of interest income on existing assets, (3) capital gains on existing assets, and (4) increases
in non-currency asset holdings. Recall from equation (3.1) that Official Reserve Assets (IR) are
composed of foreign currency reserves (ForexR), Gold, SDRs, the reserve position in the IMF,
and Other reserve assets. Foreign currency reserves, ForexR, is further divided into securities
(SEC) and currency and deposits (DEPO).
(3.1) IR= ForexR + Gold + SDR + IMF + Other
= (SEC + DEPO) + Gold + SDR + IMF + Other
The change in official reserve assets from period t to t+1, ⊿IR, is the sum of the changes in
outstanding balances of each of its components:
(4.1) ⊿IR = rs*SEC + rd*DEPO + ⊿SEC + ⊿DEPO + ⊿Gold + ⊿SDR + ⊿IMF + ⊿Other
where rs is the interest rate on securities and rd is the interest rate on deposits. Figures 1a and 1b
show visually how changes in two of these components, new SDR allocations and IMF loans,
influence reserve stocks. Define the sum of changes in Gold, SDRs, IMF reserves, and Other, as
Non-Currency Reserves (NonCR). Then,
(4.2)

IR = SEC + DEPO + NonCR.

12

(4.3)

⊿IR = rs*SEC + rd*DEPO + ⊿SEC + ⊿DEPO + ⊿NonCR

The ⊿SEC + ⊿DEPO from period t to t+1 are the sum of the purchases and sales (⊿PS) of
reserve assets and valuation changes (⊿val). We define the valuation changes as the passive
component of foreign currency reserve management, while purchases and sales are the active
component. We categorize these purchases and sales as “active management” because they are
made at the discretion of authorities; they may be made for investment purposes, precautionary
reasons, or for the purpose of influencing exchange rates. In equations:
(4.4) ⊿IR = rs*SEC + rd*DEPO + ⊿SEC + ⊿DEPO + ⊿NonCR
= rs*SEC + rd*DEPO + ⊿psSEC + ⊿psDEPO +⊿valSEC + ⊿valDEPO + ⊿NonCR

Passive Management
(valuation changes)

Changes in Gold, SDRs,
IMF, and Other

Researchers often use changes in official reserves, ⊿IR, as a proxy for foreign exchange
market interventions because few countries report these operations. However, as equation (4.4)
shows, ⊿IR includes components that have nothing to do with intervention (or active
management). Changes in reserves will be a particularly poor proxy for interventions when
interest income or valuation changes are large. (⊿NonCR does not change frequently and
available data allow these changes to be easily stripped from IR.) The conceptual problem
inherent in using ⊿IR as a proxy for interventions is due to the nondisclosure of the composition
of foreign currency reserves (ForexR).25 Ideally, researchers would like data on the types of
securities (by currency, maturity, and risk-class), and types of deposits (by currency, type of
financial institution taking deposits, and domestic or foreign) held in ForexR, in order to analyze
portfolio management of foreign currency reserves and intervention policy. However, in most
countries this kind of detailed information is not made public.
The SDDS Reserve Template, which requires reporting countries to break down the asset
categories of foreign currency reserves, goes some way toward allowing researchers to estimate
interest income. Unfortunately, details such as the currency composition of foreign currency
25

An alternative approach to isolating the purchases and sales of foreign currency reserve assets is to use “flow
variables” reported in the Balance of Payments (BOP) data set. There are two potential ways to back out the “active
management” component of reserves using the BOP statistics. First, using the Current Account, Capital Account,
and Financial Account data, net foreign reserves can be inferred, though because these data come from different
statistical inferences and aggregations, net errors and omissions are huge. A second approach involves using the
Reserves and Related Items category of the BOP, which records the market valued purchases and sales of reserve
assets. These data also include non-currency components of official reserves. Our approach is to strip the nonCR
components from Reserves and Related Items in order to estimate the valuation change component in (4.4).

13

reserves are not provided in the Reserve Template. The method we use to estimate interest
income is explained in the next section.
The Reserve and Related Items category in the Balance of Payment Statistics (BOP) records
the market valued purchases and sales of reserve assets. These data come directly from the
balance sheet of the authorities and represent real transactions (at market value) because these
data are compiled by authorities based on their transaction records. This data category also
includes transactions of gold, SDRs, the reserve position in the IMF, and other assets. Using the
notation of the ⊿IR equation, Reserves and Related Items (Res_BOP) can be expressed as
follows:
(4.5) Res_BOP = rs*SEC + rd*DEPO + ⊿psSEC + ⊿psDEPO + ⊿NonCR

Interest income

Active management
including intervention

If we subtract Reserves and Related Items from changes in official reserves we can isolate
valuation changes in foreign currency reserves. (Note that the actual entry of the Res_BOP has
the opposite sign to ⊿IR, so that to derive the difference, the two series need to be added.)
(4.6)

⊿IR – Res_BOP = ⊿valSEC + ⊿valDEP

Because Res_BOP includes interest income and changes in NonCR (the transactions involving
gold, reserves at the IMF, SDRs, and other assets) it, like ⊿IR, is not a good proxy for
intervention. But, together with estimates for interest income (which can be substantial for
countries with large stocks of reserves), and information on nonCR, we use Res_BOP to
calculate reserve stock valuation changes.

5. Active versus Passive Reserve Accumulation
While all SDDS compliant countries report detailed, marked-to-market,26 and timely
international reserve data at end-of-month values, they (unfortunately) do not provide
information about whether changes in reserves from the preceding month are due to passive
valuation changes in the underlying assets held, or active purchases or sales of reserves.27 One
of the objectives of this project is to understand whether reserves can serve as important buffers
for countries during times of crisis. In order to fully understand the role of reserves in times of
crisis, however, it is important to distinguish between active and passive reserve changes. If the
values of some reserve assets are declining, which was likely the case during the global financial
crisis, it follows that the value of country’s reserve stocks should have declined in the absence of
active reserve accumulation. So that recent studies that find limited evidence of reserve
depletion during the crisis may be misinterpreting the data.28 Stable reserve levels during the
crisis may in fact indicate that countries were actively accumulating reserves (in order to offset
valuation losses).
In order to be able to distinguish between valuation changes and active accumulation or
depletion of reserves we attempt to adjust the reserves data for changes in underlying asset
values. The SDDS Reserve Template data do not provide details on each asset held in the
foreign currency (ForexR) component of official reserves but it does provide information on the
broad composition of these reserves, specifically the share of these reserves held in securities
(SEC) versus the share in currency and deposits (DEPO). Information on the currency
denomination of these assets, in turn, is available on an aggregated basis (the data are available
for two groups: “advanced” and “emerging and developing” countries) from the Currency
Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) database29. We use the monthly
26

The SDDS reserve template guidebook says, “values of foreign currency resources are to reflect what
could be obtained for them in the market if they were liquidated; that is, at market prices on the reference date. In
cases where determining market value on a frequent basis is impractical, approximate market values can be
substituted during the intervening periods... The stock of equity securities of companies listed on stock exchanges
can be revalued based on transaction prices on the revaluation date. If such transaction prices are not available, the
midpoint of the quoted buy and sell prices of the shares on their main stock exchange on the reference date should
provide a useful approximation... For debt securities, the market price is the traded price on the reference date and
includes accrued interest. If that value is not available, other methods of approximation include yield to maturity,
discounted present value, face value less (plus) written value of discount (premium), and issue price plus
amortization of discount (premium).”
27
While we know of no countries that provide detailed accounts of the individual assets in their reserve
portfolios, some central banks provide general information regarding their reserve management strategies, which are
often published in annual reports. De Gregorio (2011) provides a discussion of the motives for reserve
accumulation in emerging economies with a special focus on the Chilean approach.
28
Another issue that arises in characterizing reserve losses is that large-reserve-loss countries during the
crisis are mainly countries whose reserves first rose and then fell, so that they both gained and lost reserves during
the crisis. This suggests that the timing used to measure reserve changes, especially during the global financial
crisis, matters.
29
These data are available at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/index.htm. There are two
studies that provide limited, but more disaggregated, information on currency composition. Truman and Wong

together with proxies for returns to securities (10-year government bond yields) and deposits (3month inter-bank yields)30, and the quarterly COFER approximations of currency
denomination31, to strip out passive interest income. We use the Reserves and Related Items line
in the BOP (Res_BOP) to strip out passive valuation changes. Figure 4 presents the underlying
security and deposit data that we use in the interest income calculations. The long-term (tenyear) government bond yields fell gradually over this time period, while the short-term (threemonth) bank yields are more dispersed and volatile prior to the GFC.

(2006: Table 3) provide an annual breakdown of the currency composition of reserves for selected countries in 2004
(based on Central Bank annual reports). Lim (2006: Table 2) disaggregates the COFER-reporting countries into
dollar-area and euro-area countries for end-of-year 1998 through 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005. He does
not identify the countries in each area due to confidentiality issues. It is also the case that some individual countries
provide currency composition information. For example, the Swiss National Bank provides current currency
denomination data on reserve assets at http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/assets/id/assets_reserves and historical data are
available through 2006 at http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/stat/statpub/histz/id/statpub_histz_actual. Likewise, the US
provides a current breakdown of reserves into euro and yen at http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chartcenter/IR-Position/Pages/01272012.aspx. The UK provides the most comprehensive data which includes detailed
monthly current and historical (starting in 1999) currency denomination data at
http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/reserves/index.htm,
30
These monthly data are from HAVER (http://www.haver.com/our_data.html). The long-term securities
used include: Japanese 10-year benchmarked government bond yields EOP, UK Government Bonds 10-Year
Nominal par yield EOP, US 10-Year Treasury Bond yields at constant maturity EOP, and Euro-area 10-year
benchmark government bond yields EOP. The short-term deposits used include: Euro-area 11-17 3-month
EURIBOR Rate EOP, UK 3-Month London Interbank offered Rate EOP, US 3-Month London Interbank offered
Rate EOP, and the Japan Call Rate uncollateralized 3-Month EOP.
31
COFER information is only available quarterly (so that in our calculations monthly shares are the same
within the quarter) and at an aggregated level. We use the COFER information in such a way that issuing countries
are not allocated shares of their own currency. For example, Euro assets are only included in the portfolios of
countries not in the euro-zone.

16

An important assumption we must make for this “simulated” interest income calculation is that
each country’s shares of foreign currency reserve assets in securities and deposits are not
adjusted over the month; interest income in period t+1 is based on shares of securities and
deposits in various currency denominations reported in period t.
The equations to follow describe our approach. Recall the basic definition of the change in
reserves:
⊿IR = ⊿ForexR + ⊿NonCR
⊿ForexR = rs*SEC + rd*DEPO + ⊿psSEC + ⊿psDEPO +⊿valSEC + ⊿valDEPO

Interest income

Active management

Passive management

If we decompose the level of foreign currency reserves at t+1 into the level that would have been
achieved without active management together with the active management component:

(5.1)

ForexR(t+1)=ForexRsim(t+1) + ⊿psSec + ⊿psDep

Active management

where simulated ForexR in t+1 is:
(5.2)

ForexRsim(t+1) = ForexR(t)+ rs*SEC + rd*DEPO +⊿valSEC + ⊿valDEPO

Figures 4 to 8 present selected country level plots of actual reserves (the solid lines) and our
“simulated” reserves series (the dashed lines) over the period 2000-2011. (Appendix B provides
these graphs for all the countries in our sample). The second plot in each figure shows the
difference between actual and simulated reserves (the bars), which we term “actively managed
reserves” and the accumulation of actively managed reserves (the solid line). In each of these
figures we also shade the country-specific crisis period (based on a peak-to-trough real
17

seasonally adjusted GDP calculations after 2007). While the full set of country plots indicate
wide variation in reserve accumulation patterns, for many countries actual reserves exceed our
“simulated” series (indicating active reserve accumulation) prior to the crisis period. During the
crisis period many countries experienced active reserve depletion (Bulgaria, Korea and Russia
all show this pattern), while in the post-crisis period, many countries are back on their pre-crisis
trend lines and are again actively accumulating reserves (Russia, Korea and Singapore provide
good examples of this pattern).

Accumulated Active Management

Reserve data for developed countries generally show little evidence of active reserve
accumulation (indeed a number of Euro-zone members were actively depleting reserves well

19

before the global financial crisis).32 Japan in 2003-4 and Switzerland in 2009-2010 are two
interesting exceptions. Both countries actively intervened to stop excessive appreciation of their
domestic currencies over this time period. In the case of Japan, active interventions involving
yen sales (and usd purchases), 35 trillion yen in total, occurred in 2003 through the first quarter
of 2004. In addition, Japan intervened once on September 15, 2010 to sell 2.1249 trillion yen (a
purchase of USD 250 billion at that day’s exchange rate).33 These intervention operations are
reflected in the large increases in actual reserves as well as active reserve accumulation in figure
5. Likewise, the plots for Switzerland show the dramatic accumulation of dollar and eurodenominated assets that occurred in March 2009 through May 2010 as a result of interventions to
stop the appreciation of the swiss franc.
Figure 9 shows average yearly active reserve accumulation for our full sample of SDDS
compliant countries starting in 2000 as well as the emerging market sample. The data indicate
that most countries were actively accumulating reserves in the five years prior to the GFC,
reserve growth slowed dramatically in 2008-9, and in the case of the emerging market sample
went negative in 2008, and then rapidly “bounced back” to pre-GFC levels by 2010.

It is worth noting that when countries join the Euro-zone we typically see a dramatic fall in foreign
reserves, which reflects the fact that Euro-denominated assets are no longer considered foreign reserves for these
countries. This pattern is very apparent in the time series for the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.
33
The Ministry of Finance in Japan discloses the daily intervention numbers (with a time delay). Prior to
this intervention, there had not been an intervention for six and half years. After this intervention, there was one
intervention on March 18, 2011, one week after the mega Earthquake in Japan to calm the yen market, as a part of a
concerted intervention operation by the G7.

6. Reserve Changes during the GFC
When a country faces sudden capital outflows, there tends to be enormous pressure to
depreciate the currency. Monetary authorities have a limited set of policy choices to counter this
pressure; they can (1) allow the exchange rate to depreciate, (2) use foreign reserves to defend
the exchange rate, (3) raise the interest rate in the hope that a higher interest rate will discourage
capital outflows, (4) impose capital controls, or (5) use a combination of all of the above. If the
pressure against the domestic currency is moderate, authorities often allow the exchange rate to
depreciate. However, in cases where the pressure is strong, concerns typically arise that
depreciation will be too precipitous and may encourage further capital outflows, which could
rapidly result in a systemic crisis in the country’s financial institutions. It is in these
circumstances that authorities typically resort to the use of foreign reserves to absorb capital
outflow pressure and to moderate the speed of currency depreciation. This will also be the case
for countries that especially value exchange rate stability. The third approach, raising the
domestic interest rate to make domestic assets more attractive, has the disadvantage of
dampening domestic demand and adversely affecting domestic investment, especially if capital
outflow pressure is strong.34
In order to measure the strength of exchange rate market pressure (EMP) during the
global financial crisis we calculate the correlation between changes in actively managed reserves
and changes in the exchange rate during the country-specific crisis periods, the two components
of EMP. Figure 10 shows combinations of exchange rate changes and active additions or
subtractions to foreign currency reserves, as measured by our “actively managed” reserves series,
for the SDDS compliant countries during the global financial crisis. The exchange rate and
reserve changes for each country are measured during the country-specific crisis period (as
shown in the shaded portions of figures 4-8; based on a peak-to-trough real SA GDP calculation
after 2007). Note that because exchange rate and reserve changes are measured over each
country’s crisis period, countries that share the same currency (for example the euro-zone
countries) will not necessarily scatter vertically on the graph as they would if changes were
measured over the same time period for all countries. The figure shows that the Japanese yen
appreciated most among the currencies of sample countries, while Denmark was the largest
reserve accumulator and Belarus experienced the largest reserve decline. Country labels are
included in the figure for all countries involved in swap arrangements during the crisis,
interestingly there seems to be no systematic relationship between involvement in swap
34

A number of recent studies have analyzed the policies available to countries experiencing capital
outflows based on their explicit preferences toward exchange rate stability and monetary independence within a
Trilemma framework. See, for example, Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2010) and Aizenman, Chinn and Ito
(2010).

21

arrangements and reserve depletion, though the figure indicates that most of the countries
receiving swap lines did experience currency depreciations.
Figure 10 indicates that the majority of countries in our sample experienced both a loss of
reserves and a depreciation of their currency during the financial crisis. The regression line
suggests that the relationship between foreign currency reserve and exchange rate changes was
mildly negative during this time period, and when we exclude the developed countries the
negative slope is less steep. While in past financial crises authorities typically either allowed
their currency to lose value or depleted reserves, these data suggest that during the global
financial crisis authorities were forced to do both. Interestingly, if we use the international
reserves data (IR) to measure reserve changes during the country-specific crisis, rather than our
active management series, we find that more of the observations appear in the upper-right
quadrant of the figure, suggesting that fewer countries that allowed their currencies to depreciate
also depleted reserves during the crisis. The reason for this is that ‘international reserves’
include components that do not reflect reserve policy actions during the crisis (recall from
equation 4.4 that changes in IR include: interest income, valuation changes, changes in the noncurrency components, and active management), which obscures the role of reserve sales.

Our time-series graphs of the country-by-country reserve data in section 5 and Appendix
B suggest that the same country may well change their approach to reserve accumulation in
reaction to global economic circumstances. Many of the emerging market countries experienced
rapid reserve accumulation in the pre-crisis period, indicating that they actively increased their
foreign currency reserve stocks in the 2007-8 period (when many of the advanced countries were
already in crisis) with depletion of reserves only starting in late 2008 and 2009. Our data also
indicate that many of these same countries reverted to their pre-crisis accumulation trends by
2010. This “reserve bounce back” is apparent in the full sample of countries as shown in Figure
11, and is similar to the “GDP bounce-back” documented in Didier, Hevia and Schmukler
(2010). Focusing on GDP growth over this period, they find a bounce-back effect in economic
activity: countries that suffered greater collapses in the global financial crisis tend to be those
that enjoyed larger growth recoveries. We will attempt to relate what we know about country’s
reserve accumulation strategies to their subsequent GDP growth in the next section.

7. Reserves and Economic Performance
Our analysis of reserve accumulation trends prior to the crisis, and the decisions made by
countries regarding exchange rate depreciation and active reserve management, suggest that
foreign currency reserves were considered a counter-cyclical policy tool, at least in some
countries, during the global financial crisis. A close inspection of the data also suggests that the
timing of the crisis in different countries matters in terms of understanding active reserve
management patterns. While the global financial crisis may have officially started in late fall of
2007 for the advanced countries (the NBER dates the US recession from December 2007 through
June 2009), for many emerging market countries the crisis started much later (these countryspecific crisis dates are listed in table 3). The data indicate that emerging market countries were
generally continuing to accumulate reserves up to the point at which their own output levels
began to decline.
Did these reserve management strategies result in less drastic output declines during the
crisis period? A recent study by Llaudes, Salman and Chivakul (2010) finds evidence among the
emerging market countries that pre-crisis reserve holdings were associated with a positive
(though diminishing at very high levels of reserves) moderating impact on output collapse.
Likewise, Frankel and Saravelos (2010) find that the level of reserves in 2007 is a significant
(negative) leading indicator of the cross-country incidence of the global financial crisis.35
It may be that the counter-cyclical value of reserves should not be measured in absolute
terms, but rather relative to a precautionary motive benchmark which reflects “reserve
adequacy”. The same dollar value of reserves might protect countries differently, depending on
specific country characteristics. In Figure 12 we examine the relationship between a measure of
reserve adequacy (international reserves measured against GDP in 2006Q4) and output growth
during the crisis. In this case, we find a negative relationship, indicating that countries with
higher reserve adequacy prior to the crisis experienced greater output declines during the crisis.

35
Frankel and Saravelos (2010) are focused on finding leading indicators rather than causes of the crisis,
but the authors conclude that their results “lend credence to the usefulness of reserve accumulations policies as
insurance during periods of crisis” (page 27). Rose and Spiegel (2010) also examine cross-country indicators of the
crisis but do not find robust links between various potential causes of the crisis, including the pre-crisis level of
reserves (and various measures of reserve adequacy), and its incidence across countries.

24

Figure 12: International Reserve Adequacy and Country-Specific Output Declines

It is also useful to examine the relationship between foreign currency reserve management
and post-crisis economic performance. Did the countries that used their reserves during the
global financial crisis experience faster GDP bounce-back after the crisis? Figure 13 indicates
that foreign currency reserve sales during the country-specific crisis periods are positively
associated with post-crisis (through 2010Q4) GDP recovery.

Reserve Purchases (+) and Sales (‐) during country‐specific crisis

The relationship between reserve accumulation and post-crisis output growth is consistent
with the reserve bounce-back pattern we found earlier (shown in Figure 11). It suggests that
those countries that used their reserves during the crisis, and replenished their reserve stocks
after the crisis, were also the countries that experienced higher GDP bounce-back by 2010Q4.
This does not suggest that building reserve stocks leads to higher economic performance, but it
does indicate a positive (unconditional) association, at least for this sample of countries in this
time period.
In order to more formally investigate the relationship between reserve stocks prior to and
during the crisis, and real GDP growth after the crisis, we examine a cross-section regression
which allows us to include additional macro controls. Table 4 presents these regression results.
The dependent variable is real GDP growth after the country-specific crisis through 2010Q4.
The explanatory variables include real GDP growth prior to the crisis, real GDP growth during
the crisis, the reserves-to-GDP ratio prior to the crisis (in 2006Q4), reserve growth during the
crisis (measured using International Reserves and Active-Management), exchange rate changes
during the crisis, and changes in the terms-of-trade36 during the crisis. The first column in table
4 presents results for our full sample of countries and subsequent columns restrict our sample in
36

Terms of Trade (TOT) data are from Haver and are measured as the percent change during the country-specific
crisis, so that a larger number indicates an improvement in that country’s terms-of-trade. Kazakhstan and Russia
experienced the largest TOT declines in our sample, while TOT improved the most for Australia, Indonesia and
Israel.

26

various ways. The second column excludes the developed countries, the third column excludes
countries that are not SDDS compliant, the fourth column excludes major commodity exporters,
the fifth column is restricted to countries with low reserves-to-debt ratios, and column six
restricts the sample to those countries with high interest differentials relative to the US, which we
label as “carry-trade counterparty countries”.
In column 3 of Table 4 we measure reserve growth during the GFC using the activemanagement series (which excludes interest income and valuation changes), which is only
available for the SDDS compliant country sample. Real GDP growth prior to the GFC
(measured from 2005 to the quarter prior to the country-specific crisis) is positive and highly
significant in the first two columns, suggesting that those countries that were on a high growth
trend prior to the crisis were more likely to return to higher growth after the crisis. Real GDP
growth during the (country-specific) crisis did not influence post-crisis recovery in any of the
regression specifications. In all the country samples we find that the larger the reserve stocks
were, relative to GDP before the GFC started, the higher was post-crisis growth. The statistical
significance of the coefficient on exchange rate changes, terms-of-trade changes, and reserve
changes during the crisis is less consistent across the columns, but the estimates often indicate
that countries which experienced larger depreciations during the crisis and larger improvements
in their terms-of-trade, had better post-crisis recovery (most likely through higher exports) .
Likewise, depletion of reserves during the crisis (measured using the active management series),
conditional on having accumulated reserves prior to the crisis, improved post-crisis growth.
We restrict our sample of countries in column 4 of the table to exclude countries that are
primary commodity exporters, which include a number of the top reserve accumulating
countries. These countries may behave differently than the rest of the sample, in that reserve
accumulation is more likely driven by commodity price movements, than the precautionary or
exchange rate stability motives. The sample of primary commodity exporter countries is too
small (12) to consider separately, but it is interesting to note that when we exclude these
countries from our sample, pre-crisis reserve stocks are still found to be positively associated
with post-crisis recovery.
The role of short-term debt both in motivating countries to build up reserves as well as its
role during the global financial crisis has been the subject of a number of recent studies,
including Blanchard, Faruqee and Das (2010), Frankel and Saravelos (2010) and Rose and
Spiegel (2010). We find, as most studies do, that countries with higher short-term debt to GDP
ratios accumulate larger stocks of reserves, reflecting the precautionary motive. The relationship
between debt and reserves during the crisis is less well understood. One of the hallmarks of the
global financial crisis was the inability of countries to refinance their debt obligations. They
faced a sudden reversal of capital flows, and deleveraging ensued. In this circumstance we might
27

expect that countries with large debt obligations would tap into their reserves to smooth the
deleveraging process. Yet a number of countries, with Korea being a prime example, opted to
draw on their Fed Swap lines rather than fully deplete their reserves. In column 5 of table 4 we
consider whether countries with relatively low reserves-to-short-term-debt ratios (below the
median for the full sample of countries) behaved differently than other countries in the sample.
In this sample of countries we find that larger reserve stocks prior to the crisis increased GDP
recovery, but exchange rate depreciation, terms-of-trade changes, and reserve depletion during
the crisis did not make a difference.
Another of the explanatory variables that has been found to be important in explaining
reserve accumulation is the interest differential; countries with interest rates that are higher than
those in the US tend to accumulate more reserves. These countries accumulate reserves, despite
their higher fiscal costs of maintaining their reserve stock. These same countries may
inadvertently be counter-parties to the carry trade. Carry-traders borrow in low interest
currencies and invest in high interest currencies, while most reserve building countries invest in
low interest foreign currencies (mostly the US dollar) and borrow at the (relatively higher)
domestic interest rate. In other words, this sample of countries is likely to experience the largest
valuation losses, yet the regression results reported in column 6 indicate that they also benefitted
from high pre-crisis reserve stocks. One explanation for why these carry-trade counterparty
countries accumulate reserves (even as they lose money on the reserve stocks) is that they may
be concerned about the stability of their domestic banking system, which is likely financing the
carry trade (see Shin (2010). We also find that exchange rate depreciation (which would lead to
capital gains on reserves) played an important role, in terms of GDP recovery, for these
countries.
8. Conclusions
The contribution of this paper is four-fold. First, we make use of the SDDS Reserve
Template data which provides a breakdown of the types of assets (securities and deposits)
included in the foreign currency reserve component of official reserves. This data, along with
assumptions on currency composition and the applicable interest rate on these assets, make it
possible to estimate the passive interest income and valuation changes which are included in
measures of official reserves. Second, we derive the actively managed component of foreign
currency reserves by subtracting the interest income and valuation changes from the official
reserve data. As a consequence, we have much better estimates of actual purchases and sales of
reserve assets, which are conceptually similar to foreign exchange intervention. Third, we find
that emerging market economies did deplete foreign currency reserves during the global financial
28

crisis. Many countries that were reserve accumulators before the crisis used their reserves and
allowed their currencies to depreciate during the crisis. We also find evidence of “reserve bounce
back”; after the crisis many emerging market countries went back to their pre-crisis reserve
accumulation trends. Fourth, we find that real GDP growth recovery after the crisis was stronger
for countries with large pre-crisis accumulations of foreign currency reserves. The influence of
currency depreciation and reserve depletion during the crisis on GDP growth after the crisis
differed depending on which countries are included in the sample.
Official reserve accumulation among emerging market economies is a contentious topic.
Trading partners often accuse reserve accumulators of having mercantilist motives, and
domestically large reserve stocks are sometimes criticized as wasteful resource
allocation. Emerging market economies often rebut these criticisms by citing the self-insurance
value of reserves. They argue that reserves reduce the probability of falling into a crisis, and that
the value of self-insurance exceeds the costs. Our findings support the view that higher reserve
accumulations prior to the global financial crisis are associated with higher post-crisis GDP
growth.

Appendix A: The Evolution of the SDDS guidelines
When Mexico announced its devaluation on December 20, 1994, investors were surprised
to realize that Mexican international reserves had not been disclosed in a timely manner.37 For
example, Mexico did not disclose its reserve position in the month (November) prior to the
devaluation. The IMF was criticized for its perceived lack of surveillance and responded by
increasing its emphasis on transparency and disclosure of international reserves and other data. 38
Quick calculations from trade data and other statistics led investors to the realization that
Mexican international reserves were most likely exhausted. Moreover, investors realized that the
Mexican government had large external liabilities in the form of short-term, (de facto) dollardenominated, government bonds (tesobonos).39 Heavy selling pressure occurred in the two days
after the announcement of the devaluation, and the Mexican government was forced to allow the
peso to float on December 22, the peso lost half of its pre-devaluation value in a week. It was
later argued that if the Mexican government financial information, in particular the international
reserves position, had been disclosed in a timely manner, market discipline would have worked:
investors would have demanded a higher premium on Mexican bonds much earlier, forcing the
Mexican government to take corrective actions. Thus, timely disclosure of foreign exchange data
and other macroeconomic information became a focus of reform in the international financial
community.
The IMF described its motivation for the SDDS and GDDS initiatives as follows: “work
on standards and codes began in the wake of the 1994–95 international financial crisis, which
underscored the role that information deficiencies play in contributing to market turmoil.
…financial markets, for example, relied on information that too often was incomplete and out of
date and thus could adversely affect resource allocation and the pricing of country risks. In
response to these circumstances, the international community asked the IMF—in line with its
role in the international financial system—to set standards in the provision of economic and
financial statistics to the public. In response to this request, the IMF established the SDDS in
1996 as the first of its core standards” (Alexander (2008; p.7).
When the Asian financial crisis occurred in 1997, proper disclosure of international
37

IMF (1995; p. 56) states, “… the stock of foreign reserves remained fairly stable until the end of October.
In November, selling pressures on the Mexican peso increased again, and foreign exchanges reserves in Mexico
declined $4.8. This reduced the stock of reserves to $12.9 billion by the end of November. The decline in reserves in
November was not publicly announced until after the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December” (emphasis is
the authors’).
38
The Mexican team at the IMF had not closely monitored the macroeconomic and capital market situation
since their Article IV visit to Mexico City in the spring of 1994.
39
The tesobonos were peso-denominated short-term government bonds, but the interest rates were linked to
the dollar-peso interest rate, making them essentially dollar denominated liabilities to the Mexican government. See
IMF (1995; chapter 3).

reserves became an issue for the Asian governments. The issue was not the total amount of
international reserves, but their composition and usability. By June 1997, all of the crisis-hit
Asian countries—Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Korea—had subscribed to the SDDS.
When the baht was hit by waves of speculative attacks in the spring of 1997, in particular
mid-May 1997, the Bank of Thailand became the counterparty of hedge funds and investment
banks in the dollar-baht swap arrangements. By late May the Bank built up huge forward
contracts to deliver US dollars in three to six months. Essentially, the Bank of Thailand had
exhausted international reserves if the current and future positions were consolidated.
The Bank of Thailand became a counterparty to huge speculations against the Thai baht
and lost sizable foreign reserves in forward positions, but their statistics (which only provided
current positions) showed ample reserves (this reporting was IMF-consistent at the time). On
July 2, 1997, the Bank of Thailand floated the exchange rate. The market at that time had yet to
realize the extent of the Bank’s exposure to forward contracts. After the forward position was
revealed in August 1997, at the time of IMF program approval, the market was surprised because
the exposure was higher than market estimates. This episode made it clear that the “forward
position” of the central bank should be included in the foreign reserve data release. After the
crisis the IMF responded by requiring reporting on forward contracts.
The Korean government during November – December 1997 deposited foreign reserves
into Korean commercial banks, and Korean commercial banks used them to repay chaebol firms’
foreign liabilities. Thus, “usable” reserves were much lower than international reserves in
official statistics (then consistent with IMF SDDS). These examples, as well as other Asian
country responses to capital outflows with dwindling foreign reserves, are described in detail in
Ito (2007a)). Deposits with domestic commercial banks became a source of difficulty in the
interpretation of private-and official-sector external transactions and, in the case of emerging
market countries, a source of suspicion for adequacy of international reserves at the time of
crisis.40

Japan, along with a number of other countries, holds a portion of its official dollar deposits, which are
counted as reserves, in domestic banks. The problem with this is that these deposits are not claims on a foreigner,
unless commercial banks hold enough foreign assets themselves. When Japan puts together its BOP accounts it
includes the increase in reserves as a financial outflow. At the same time it must remove that same amount from the
outflows of its banks. But the banks may use the official dollar deposits to buy, for example, US Treasury bills. So
the data show the Japanese official sector increasing dollar deposits and the U.S. thinks it sees the Japanese private
sector buying or holding T-bills, while the Japanese BOP show a reduction in the private bank claims on the U.S.
