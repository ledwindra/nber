    "abstract": "\n\nThis study examines the influence of agricultural labor intensity on individualism across U.S. counties. To measure historical labor intensity in agriculture, we combine data on crop-specific labor requirements and county-specific crop mix around 1900. Potential endogeneity of agricultural labor intensity is addressed using climate-induced variation in crop mix. Our estimates indicate that a one standard deviation increase in labor intensity is associated with a reduction of 0.2-0.3 standard deviations in individualism (as captured by the share of children with infrequent names). We further document significant changes in individualism over time using within-county changes in labor intensity due to mechanization and the boll weevil. We also show that historical agricultural labor intensity continues to influence geographic variation in individualism today.\n\n",
