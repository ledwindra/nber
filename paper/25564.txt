How Does Supplemental Medicare Coverage Affect the Disabled Under-65 Population?: An
Exploratory Analysis of the Health Effects of States’ Medigap Policies for SSDI Beneficiaries

ABSTRACT
A substantial portion of the costs associated with, and the value to beneficiaries of, Social
Security Disability Insurance is Medicare eligibility. However, the benefits of this eligibility can
vary due to differences in state policies on supplemental Medicare coverage, also known as
Medigap. Although Medigap policies are federally regulated to be issued to 65-and-over
Medicare beneficiaries with specific restrictions over underwriting, these policies are left to states
to regulate with regard to the under-65 SSDI population, generating substantial cross-state and
temporal variation. This paper documents the variation in availability and generosity of under-65
Medigap eligibility for the SSDI population. Furthermore, it exploits this variation to provide
initial estimates of how this eligibility affects the health status of non-Medicaid-eligible SSDI
recipients. Our main finding is that requiring Medigap plans be offered for under-65 SSDI
recipients substantially improves self-reported health of this population, with suggestive evidence
that this improvement is stronger as underwriting restrictions increase and among SSDI
beneficiaries with mental health conditions. The estimated effect is highly robust to alternative
scaling or categorizations of self-reported health, choice of data set, inclusion of fixed effects,
controls for local Medicare Advantage penetration, and falsification tests. This effect is nearly
three times the size of the estimated increase in self-reported health in the Oregon Medicaid
expansion.

Introduction
A substantial portion of the costs associated with, and the value to beneficiaries of, Social Security
Disability Insurance is Medicare eligibility. SSDI recipients are the vast majority of under-65 Medicareeligible population in the US, 1 and while previous work has focused on behavior and outcomes during the
two-year waiting period between cash benefit and Medicare eligibility or the effects of eliminating this
waiting period, there is much less research on the impact of differences in Medicare coverage itself,
including private supplemental coverage (Medigap) and Medicare Advantage (MA). These differences
arise from two sources: first, although the over-65 Medicare population faces federally required
guaranteed issuance and open and special enrollment periods limiting underwriting, Medigap policies for
under-65 SSDI recipients depend on state regulations; and second, the availability of managed care
options through Medicare Advantage and Special Needs Plans (SNPs), also varies dramatically from
market to market. This paper documents the variation in availability and generosity of cost-sharing
Medigap options, then uses this variation to provide new evidence of the impact of the structure of health
care coverage on health for this population.
There is a long history of estimating the effects of health insurance coverage on a range of
outcomes, including health service usage, health status, mortality, and labor market outcomes. Measuring
these effects is of central policy interest, given that over a quarter of the US federal budget is dedicated to
Medicare and Medicaid, and numerous government programs insure or directly provide health care for
certain subpopulations. But an early and consistent finding in in this literature was a lack of evidence of a
positive effect of health insurance coverage on health outcomes on average (e.g., Newhouse et al. 1993,
Finkelstein and McKnight 2008, Baicker et al. 2013; see Levy and Meltzer 2008 and Rutledge 2016 for
reviews). Although many of these studies find a substantial monetary welfare benefit due to increased
coverage, the average newly covered individual experienced little detectable gain in health or work
capacity.

1

End stage renal disease (ESRD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the only other two groups, and are
substantially smaller than the over 9 million SSDI Medicare beneficiaries.

This lack of an average effect on health and work outcomes belies the potential importance of
coverage for vulnerable subpopulations, including the elderly, low-income groups, those with chronic
health conditions, and those seeking behavioral health services (Dow et al. 1997, Card, Dobkins, and
Maestas 2009, Andersen 2015). One particular subpopulation for which we would expect positive
benefits of health coverage is the long-term disabled, especially given recent quasi-experimental evidence
that larger SSDI cash benefits decrease beneficiary mortality (Gelber et al. 2018). Despite Medicare
eligibility after two years of SSDI cash benefit eligibility, there are a limited number of prior studies on
the role of Medicare in the health of this population. This prior work primarily identifies the effect of
health insurance using the two-year waiting period between Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
cash-benefit eligibility and Medicare eligibility (Riley 2006, Livermore et al. 2009, and Michalopoulous
et al. 2011). However, limited follow-up periods and lack of variation in anything but the timing of
eligibility naturally limit the policy margins for which conclusions can be drawn. As a result, we know
little about how the disabled population’s health and work capacity is affected by health insurance
coverage, and even less about how structural differences in this coverage could translate into differential
health effects.
This study presents a preliminary analysis of the impact in varying access to Medicare
supplemental coverage on the health of the SSDI population. It exploits cross-state and temporal variation
in these measures, most notably state-level changes in required Medigap issuance for the under-65
Medicare population, and draws on the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to estimate
the impact of such required Medigap issuance and limitations on underwriting on the self-reported health
of the long-term disabled population. Although the data in question allow for only estimation of the
impact of Medigap policies on this measure of health, self-reported health has been shown to provide an
independent explanatory component to a range of health outcomes. Most notably, those reporting poor
health have twice to four times the estimated mortality odds ratios (Idler and Benyamini 1997).
Furthermore, self-reported health is likely to be more sensitive to changes in quality of life, morbidity
severity, and functional impairments than mortality measures (Levy and Meltzer 2008).

There are two direct policy implications for exploring the effect of the structure of Medicare
benefits on the SSDI population. First, since the role of government in the health care sector continues to
be an actively discussed area of policymaking, understanding the subpopulations most likely to be helped
or hurt by changes in government-provided insurance coverage, by how much, and by which insurance
structures, directly informs these discussions. Second, the SSDI population is large and diverse, with
approximately 9 million disabled workers and millions more dependents and survivors (SSA 2016), so
understanding the health needs and work capacity responses to the structure of health insurance coverage
can provide insight as to how to optimally design this program and its benefit structure going forward.

Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare Eligibility
In addition to retirement benefits, the Social Security Administration provides disability coverage for
workers in the US. Coverage and benefit level is determined by prior Social Security-taxable wages, but
benefit eligibility requires a health condition or set of health conditions expected to last for at least 12
months or result in death, and which prevent earning at a Substantial Gainful Activity level ($1,180 per
month in 2018). The application process can be lengthy, with many stages of potential appeal if rejected,
and requires de facto labor force exit. If determined to be disabled, individuals are entitled to monthly
cash benefits five calendar months after their disability established onset date. Twenty-four months after
initial monthly cash benefit entitlement, SSDI beneficiaries gain eligibility for Medicare coverage.
However, on its own, fee-for-service Medicare carries with it a range of deductibles and a 20%
coinsurance rate for physician expenditures. Additionally, there is no lifetime out-of-pocket maximum.
As such, most Medicare beneficiaries purchase or otherwise obtain supplemental coverage, via Medicaid,
Medigap, Medicare Advantage, employer-provided plans, VA health benefits, or TRICARE. However,
this supplemental coverage differs across type of Medicare beneficiary: in 2012, nearly 90% of over-65
Medicare beneficiaries had supplemental coverage, while under 80% of the under-65 Medicare
population had supplemental coverage (Cubanski 2016). Due to the relatively lower assets and income of
this population, the SSDI population has historically been substantially more likely to be eligible for

Medicaid benefits, with 35% of the under-65 Medicare population being dually enrolled in Medicaid
compared to 10% of the over-65 Medicare population.
For the non-dual-eligible SSDI beneficiaries, the focus of this paper, the alternative sources of
supplemental coverage are employer-sponsored insurance (minimal for this group due to the work
restrictions for SSDI eligibility), Medicare Advantage, and Medigap supplemental insurance. These latter
two options, although accounting for nearly half of the over-65 Medicare population’s supplemental
insurance (31% MA and 17% Medigap in 2012), have a different structure for the disabled population;
while a similar proportion of the under-65 Medicare population have MA (27%), only 2% have Medigap
(Cubanski 2016).

Medigap
Medigap insurance arose to meet the demand for wrap‐around coverage for extra expenses not covered by
Medicare, with the plans' coverage characteristics federally standardized in 1990. Appendix Table 1
shows the standardized plan designs for plans A through N; beneficiaries pay a monthly premium to
enroll in a particular plan. An insurer need not offer every plan type, but if it offers any, it must offer a
Plan A and either a Plan C or Plan F, although these requirements apply only to plans offered to the over65 population. Due to its extensive coverage, Plan F is the most popular Medigap plan, accounting for
over 50% of Medigap enrollees (Starc 2014). Unlike Medicare Advantage plans, Medigap coverage is not
restricted to a network. During open enrollment and special enrollment periods (e.g., if an over-65
Medicare MA beneficiary’s MA plan is discontinued), insurers are not allowed to underwrite Medigap
policies.
However, states have separate policies governing the availability and allowable price
discrimination of these Medigap policies for the under-65 population (Harrison 2017). Certain states have
enacted protections to ensure that Medicare enrollees under-65 can purchase Medigap plans, but there is
wide variation across states as to whether and what kinds of Medigap plans are available. These state
policies vary on a number of attributes. First, some states differentiate between Medicare enrollees

enrolled because of disability and those enrolled due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); states may have
Medigap guaranteed issue requirements that apply to one group, both groups or neither. States that have
some form of guaranteed issue requirement for disabled enrollees under 65 also vary with respect to their
requirements for open enrollment periods, during which available policies cannot be underwritten. Lastly,
states vary on their policies related to Medigap premiums. State rules also vary with respect to their
premium rating rules (attained age, issue age, or community rating), whether insurers can charge different
premiums to those enrollees over 65 as those under 65 (or limits to the extent that premiums can vary),
and whether insurers must charge the same premium to all enrollees under 65 (or limits to the periods and
types of plans to which this applies). Further, some insurers offer Medigap plans to enrollees even if they
are not required to do so, or offer rate setting, underwriting, or premiums that exceed state requirements.
We examined the prevalence of these laws to require Medigap insurers to offer plans to the
under-65 population over the period 2004 to 2018 using annual editions of Choosing a Medigap Policy: A
Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS), accessed through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. For this time period, Table 1 shows
which states never had such a requirement, which states always did, which states added the requirement,
and which ones had a requirement they then removed, along with the year that any change took place.
Although the majority of states did not change their requirement status of this time period, nine states
added the requirement and two removed it, with Kentucky having added, removed, and re-added the
requirement. Furthermore, Table 2 shows the additional regulations surrounding open enrollment periods
and underwriting restrictions. The vast majority of states requiring issuance of at least one type of
Medigap plan also require an open enrollment period. However, there is substantial variation surrounding
the premium rating rules in these states. A majority restrict underwriting to some degree, with fourteen
requiring parallel underwriting of under- and over-65 Medicare beneficiaries, and nine requiring only that
all under-65 Medicare beneficiaries be rated equally.
As such, there is substantial variation across the country in the requirement of insurers to offer
these Medigap plans to the under-65 Medicare population. At the current time, we do not have historical

Medigap plan availability for this population over this time period; however, we do have availability of
current 2018 Medigap policies through https://www.medicare.gov/download/downloaddb.asp, which
provide which plans are available in each state and whether these plans are available for the under-65
population.
In 2018, for states not requiring Medigap insurers to offer plans to the under-65 Medicare
population, there were an average of 24.2 Medigap total plans offered to the under-65 Medicare
beneficiaries per state. For states that did require such plans be offered for the under-65 Medicare
population in 2018, there were an average of 126.2 Medigap plans offered to this population per state.
Additionally, only 41% of non-requiring states had a Plan F offered for the under-65 population; 81% of
requiring states had such a plan available. These differences are highly statistically significant. Although
we do not have comparisons for the entire period shown, these statistics indicate that this state-level
requirement is strongly associated with greater availability of Medigap plans, especially the highcoverage Plan F.
Enactment of state policies related to disabled Medicare enrollees under 65 are trending toward
more protections; in 2004, 24 states had these protections, whereas in 2018, 32 do. It is not obvious that
this policy variation is related to health trends in these populations or state-level political attitudes toward
expanded health coverage. 2 However, Appendix Table 2 provides OLS estimates of state-level
characteristics on under-65 Medigap policy. When controlling for an array of sociodemographic
characteristics as well the Democratic margin in the 2008 Presidential Election, more populous states,
more rural states, and more Democratic states are more likely to required guaranteed issuance of Medigap
plans for the under-65 Medicare population. Although there are serious power concerns (N=9), there are
no statistically significant correlates of when a state chose to require this issuance. Moreover, there are no
significant correlates of the specific under-65 Medigap policies. As such, our preferred specifications
include state fixed-effects to account for any persistent confounding differences across states.

2

For example, the correlation between 2014 Medicaid expansion states and the states which required issuance of a
Medigap policy to the under-65 Medicare population is only -0.112, with a p-value of 0.429.

In our analysis of SIPP data below, survey respondents who experienced a change in state policy
over under-65 Medigap policy resided in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, or Tennessee, with the majority
residing in Florida or Georgia. Both Florida’s adoption of these protections in 2009 and Georgia’s
adoption in 2010 were primarily motivated by lobbying of NBA All-Star Alonzo Mourning, a former
player for the Miami Heat and ESRD survivor. Before the signing the bill, Florida Governor Charlie
Crist was quoted: “When somebody of his celebrity status ... undertakes a cause like this and really gets
behind it and really pushes it, it's hard to say no.” While many news outlets picked up the story, news
coverage of the law emphasized its implications for ESRD patients in Florida, even though they represent
only 1% of people impacted by the law, far fewer than the Floridians with Medicare coverage through
SSDIbecause of disability. The idiosyncrasy of such political motivation 3 is indicative of the plausible
exogeneity of under-65-Medigap policy changes to the underlying health of the affected population.

Medicare Advantage
Individuals who are eligible for Medicare may opt to gain coverage through a private plan chosen
in the Medicare Advantage (MA) market, many of which charge no additional premium for enrollment.
Although they offer more supplemental coverage, like Medigap, and are underwritten only by service
area, the tradeoff faced by beneficiaries selecting an MA plan is that most of these plans are managed care
plans or bundle Part D prescription drug plans with formulary limitations. Hence, they restrict enrollees to
a particular network of doctors and require referrals for specialists, as well as potentially limit covered
prescription drugs.
Additionally, insurers may offer Special Needs Plans (SNPs) in select counties or states; SNPs
can be one of three varieties based on the eligible population: those with chronic health conditions, those
dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, or institutionalized populations. Although there are a range of

See, for example, the genesis of Delaware’s under-65 Medigap policy change spearheaded by a local patient
advocacy lobbyist diagnosed with breast cancer: https://khn.org/news/buying-supplemental-insurance-can-behard-for-younger-medicare-beneficiaries-2/
3

chronic health condition categories that chronic health condition SNPs (C-SNPs) can offer eligibility to,
insurers are free to limit eligibility to a subset of these conditions, in some cases focusing the SNP on one
specific type of health condition. Since we generally exclude Medicaid dual-eligibles in our analysis to
avoid conflation of cross-state differences and changes in Medicaid policy with Medicare coverage
options, 4 and the institutionalized population is not included in the sampling frame of our data, we focus
here on C-SNPs, which are of particular applicability to the long-term disabled SSDI population as well.
A recent spate of research has exploited variation in the availability and generosity of Medicare
Advantage (MA) plans, private managed care plans offered by insurers to all Medicare beneficiaries in a
particular coverage area, for the over-65 Medicare population (Geruso and Layton 2015, Cabral et al.
2014). Although the original introduction of SNPs was accompanied with pilot program evaluations and
observational comparisons in plan quality (Cromwell et al. 2008; Maciejewski et al. 2011), there is no
research that we are aware of that examines the impact of MA plans, and specifically the availability and
generosity of SNPs, on the health market outcomes of the SSDI population.
The central difficulty in estimating the impact of MA and MA SNP availability on health
outcomes is the endogeneity of these plans’ being offered. Not every county or state has every SNP, and
the introduction of a particular chronic condition SNP, for example one for diabetes, may be responding
to increasing rates of diabetes in the population. In this analysis, we do not attempt to estimate the causal
relationship between the availability of MA and MA SNPs on health outcomes, although as a robustness
check, we control for prior years’ availability of these plans in order to control for alternative
supplemental options that would affect those potentially considering purchasing a Medigap policy. We
leave for future research the implementation of a causal estimation strategy of the availability of and
enrollment in these plans on SSDI beneficiaries’ health. Appendix Figures 1 and 2 show the enrollment
and availability in MA and C-SNP plans based on cms.gov enrollment figures. Enrollment in both types
of plans have increased from 2008 to 2016, although C-SNP plans experienced a dip in enrollment in

We do perform a falsification check of state Medigap policies on the dual eligible Medicaid population, which
should be unaffected by such policies, and indeed estimate null results.

between. Figure 2 shows the fraction of states 5 that had any enrollment in C-SNP plans in three specific
categories of chronic health conditions: cardiovascular, mental/behavioral health, or diabetes.6 It is clear
that the pronounced dip from 2010 to 2011 corresponds to a similar drop in the number of states with
cardiovascular or diabetes C-SNPs. Regardless, most states have a C-SNP plan that allows those with
cardiovascular or diabetes chronic conditions to enroll. However, there are far fewer states with C-SNP
plans for those with mental or behavioral health chronic conditions. This lack of C-SNP availability may
suggest that for those with chronic mental health issues, supplemental Medicare coverage may be less
available.

Analysis of Impact on SSDI Population
Data
In order to test the effects of Medicare supplementation policies on the health of the SSDI population, one
needs a data source that contains SSDI or Medicare coverage, age, geographic location, and health. Such
requirements are satisfied by the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a panel survey
traditionally started every four years, with approximately 100,000 respondents. These respondents are
interviewed with a core survey ever four months, eliciting information on income, work activity, public
program participation, health insurance coverage, and living situation for each of the four months since
the last interview. Topical modules are also included in each interview wave. We draw upon the 2008
SIPP, which in late 2009, 2010, and 2011 (interview waves 4, 7, and 10) fielded the same topical module:
Medical Expenses/Utilization of Health Care. This module elicited detailed information on medical costs
and usage of the health care system. In this analysis, we focus on the five-point self-reported health
measure, which varies from 1 for “Excellent” to 5 for “Poor.” In this analysis, we follow the Ware et al.

5

C-SNPs are generally not offered at the state-level; they are offered at the county or collection of county level.
However, the empirical analysis conducted in this study is at the state level, and thus we aggregate availability of
such plans at the state level. Although not shown, we include measures of size of C-SNP plan types as well (e.g., at
least 100 enrollees or at least 1,000 enrollees), without any notable difference in our findings.
6
Many C-SNP plans are open to multiple types of chronic conditions. We count a plan as belonging to one of these
categories if any of the conditions it covers is one of these condition types.

(2002) rescaling of this measure, 7 as these authors’ scaling analyses suggest that these categorizations do
not represent equal differences in self-rated health. Tables 6 and 7 present results using alternative
categorizations of these health variables, with broadly similar findings.
Although there are approximately 105,000 respondents in the 2008 SIPP, we limit our analytic
sample to only those respondents in each of these interview waves who were:
1) Current recipients of Social Security income for a disability in at least one month of the
current wave
2) Aged 21 to 64
3) Currently covered by Medicare in at least one month of the current wave
4) Not covered by Medicaid in any of the months of the current wave
These restrictions limit the sample to 1,586 unique individuals. Table 3 presents descriptive statistics of
this group. Not surprisingly given their status as SSDI beneficiaries, their health tends to be at the poor
end of the spectrum, with nearly two thirds reporting either Poor or Fair health. We construct a measure
of whether the same individual reports the same or better health as in the last topical module to allow for
comparability with Baicker et al. (2013). This measure excludes all those who reported “Poor” health in
the prior wave, since mechanically such individuals would always have an outcome of one. This measure
shows that the majority of respondents maintain or improve their health between interviews. This under65 Medicare population is also relatively old for this age window, with an average age of 54.44.
Nearly two-thirds of respondents reside in a state with a requirement for insurers to issue at least
one Medigap plan for the under-65 population, whereas only a quarter require that during the open
enrollment period, such under-65 Medicare beneficiaries must not have a higher premium than over-65
Medigap beneficiaries.
From 2009 to 2011, four states change their Medigap requirement policy: Florida, Georgia, and
Tennessee added the requirement, while Kentucky removed it. In our sample, there are 108 under-65
Medicare beneficiaries for whom we observe self-reported health before and after such a change.

7

This rescaling assigns values as such: 5 (Excellent), 4.4 (Very Good), 3.4 (Good), 2.0 (Fair), and 1.0 (Poor).

Analysis
Our analytic approach is weighted least squares, using the person-level probability weights from the
SIPP. The most common specification we fit is:
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜌𝜌𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

Where the outcome variable is SSDI-Medicare beneficiary i’s self-reported health in year t. The

coefficient of interest is β, which measures the effect of being in a state that requires Medigap insurers
provide a Medigap plan for the SSDI-Medicare population. Fixed effects for each state and year are
included, denoted by δ and ρ, while each state’s MA and C-SNP enrollment in the prior year are included
to control for general availability of such alternatives without confounding any effect of the Medigap
policy with same-year MA enrollment, although these measures, given their endogeneity, are not always
included (regardless, there is no statistically significant impact on the estimate if they are included or not).
Finally, X is a matrix of individual-level covariates, including race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Standard
errors are two-way clustered at the state and year level, given that the variation in treatment is at the stateyear level. The inclusion of state- and year-fixed effects thereby identifies the impact of Medigap policy
from states changing their under-65 Medigap policy.
Table 4 presents linear regression results of the impact of this change on self-reported health,
where health is rescaled according to Ware et al. (2002)’s methodology, which varies from 1 to 5, but
assigns higher values to Good and Very Good health. The columns employ different specifications, with
the addition of demographic controls, state and year fixed effects, and clustering standard errors in a twoway cluster at the state and year levels. All specifications provide statistically significant and substantial
improvements in self-reported health. Additionally, as we add more controls, the size of the effect
generally becomes larger. Column 4 is the preferred specification for estimating the impact of a state
requiring a Medigap insurer offer plans to the under-65 Medicare population, since it corresponds to a
fully saturated difference-in-differences analysis of the impact of the Medigap requirement on health. 8

8

Note that with the limited pre- and post-periods, parallel trends assumptions cannot be tested.

There is a 0.193 increase in the five-point health measure, representing an average improvement of
approximately a fifth of a point, or one in five beneficiaries reporting a one point improvement in selfreported health. 9 Columns 5 and 6 include measures of lagged Medicare Advantage enrollment and for
whether that state had enrollment in one of the three types of C-SNPs shown in Figure 2 in the prior year,
but this inclusion has little statistically significant impact on the estimate.
Column 7 includes not just the overall under-65 guaranteed issue requirement, but also the
additional types of Medigap regulation; it is worth noting that changes in these types of regulation
occurred only when the guaranteed issuance requirement changed. Nevertheless, the overall coefficient
shows that guaranteed issuance improves health even more. However, having an open enrollment period
requirement mitigates this effect. This finding may initially seem counterintuitive, but such an open
enrollment period without premium rating regulations may limit the affordability of such plans to the
under-65 population. Indeed, the coefficient estimate for states with the strongest premium rating
restriction – under-65 Medicare beneficiaries must be charged the same premium as over-65 beneficiaries
– the effect on improved health is even stronger, if only marginally statistically significant. Finally,
Column 8 estimates the health impact including individual-level fixed effects, thereby absorbing many
potentially confounding selection effects. The estimate, albeit noisier, is statistically indistinguishable
from our preferred specification in Column 4.
Our overall conclusion from these regressions is that states requiring Medigap insurers to offer at
least one Medigap plan to the under-65 Medicare population measurably and substantially improves this
population’s self-reported health. This improvement is consistent across a range of specifications and
appears even stronger in the presence of additional regulations limiting premium underwriting, although
inference of these regulations is limited by the sample window in question. But to test the robustness and

incidence of our findings, Tables 5 and 6 presents estimates by subpopulation, an alternative data set, and
over populations which should not be directly affected by under-65 Medigap policies.
Column 1 in Table 5 presents results from our preferred specification (Column 4 in Table 4) for
the purposes of comparison. Column 2 provides a separate interacted marginal effect by sex, indicating
that the improved health effect is stronger for male SSDI beneficiaries. Column 3 provides estimates of
interactions with type of health condition reported by the SIPP respondent: the improved health effect is
even stronger among those with mental health conditions. 10 Given the relative paucity of mental or
behavioral health-specific SNPs and historical restrictions in Medicare coverage of mental-health-related
care (Donohue et al. 2009, Busch et al. 2016), affordable Medigap policies may be of particular use for
SSDI beneficiaries with mental health conditions. Column 4 provides four robustness checks: given that
the within-state variation in Medigap coverage arises from only four states, we conduct four separate
estimates dropping each of these states to determine whether the estimated effect is driven by just a single
state and potential confounding idiosyncrasies of such a state. The estimated effect remains highly
statistically significant and is statistically unchanged from the estimate shown in Column 1. Table 5
therefore shows that there is not a single state driving the estimated effect, and that this effect is strongest
among male SSDI beneficiaries and those beneficiaries reporting a mental health condition.
Table 6 provides further robustness and falsification tests. Columns 3 through 7 all use the same
Ware-rescaled self-reported health measure from Tables 4 and 5, with Column 3 reporting the result from
the same regression as in Column 4 of Table 4 and Column 1 of Table 5. Columns 1 and 2 show estimates
based on different rescalings of the self-reported health measure: Column 1 shows the effect from a lack
of any scale, preserving the 1 (Excellent) to 5 (Poor) health metric, and providing a nearly identical effect
on health as the Ware-rescaled estimate. Column 2 provides an estimate with the Diehr et al. (2000)
rescaling, from 15 for Poor, 30 for Fair, 80 for Good, 90 for Very Good, and 95 for Excellent. Although
noisier (the Diehr rescaling leads a strongly bimodal rescaling of the self-reported health distribution), the

Although the absolute value of the combined effect for those with a heart condition or diabetes indicates a
worsening of health for these groups, this combined effect is not statistically significantly different from zero.

estimated impact is still statistically significant. Furthermore, the estimated change from our preferred
specification in Column 3 is 3.9% of the maximum health value in the Ware et al. (2002) scale, 11 while
the estimated change in Column 2 is 3.7% of the maximum health value in the Diehr et al. (2001) scale, 12
representing similar impacts on health. Although the Ware-rescaled health measure is our preferred
metric, our results are not dependent on that preference.
Although the nature of our SIPP sample window is fortunate for its position after the large
Medicare changes of the mid-2000s and before the implementation of the ACA, having health measures
in only 2009, 2010, and 2011 precludes tests of parallel trends or other common difference-in-differences
validation tests. To provide evidence that the policy variable in question is not confounded by other
broader policy changes or effects that could differentially affect health even while controlling for state
and year fixed effects, Columns 4 and 5 report falsification tests where the same analysis is performed on
groups that are not directly affected by under-65 Medigap policies: SSDI beneficiaries who are dually
eligible for Medicaid, and 18-64 year-olds who are not Medicare beneficiaries at all. The former group,
although generally poorer than non-Dual-Eligibles, are nevertheless similar to non-Dual-Eligible
population in being covered by SSDI and having serious health conditions. Medigap insurers are
generally legally barred from selling policies to the Dual Eligible population except in certain situations,
and, in the absence of health spillovers, there should be no effect of state under-65 Medigap regulation on
this group. Although we find a positive point estimate of the Medigap guaranteed issuance requirement on
the health of this population, this estimate is markedly smaller than our prior estimate, and is not nearly
statistically significant. Furthermore, estimates of state Medigap policy on the non-Medicare adult
population are virtually zero. Both these estimates suggest that the estimated effect is due to the state
Medigap policy under question and is not being driven by other unobservable trends.
Finally, we test whether our results are being driven specifically by the SIPP data set. We draw
upon the cross-sectional CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement (i.e., the “March CPS” or CPS

ASEC) which contains self-reported health, SSDI receipt, age, state, Medicare coverage, and Medicaid
coverage. Because it is limited in measures of disabling health conditions and is cross-sectional (and thus
does not allow for including individual fixed effects, as in Table 4, Column 8, and does not allow for
estimates of improvements in health as reported in Table 7 which enables comparison to health estimates
from other studies), we prefer the SIPP as our primary data set.
However, it does have more years of observation, and thus more states’ changes in guaranteed
issuance policy, and Column 6 shows the estimated impact from 2004 to 2013. We find a statistically
similar improvement in health, albeit with a smaller point estimate, in states with Medigap guaranteed
issuance policies for the under-65 Medicare population, following the same state- and year-fixed-effects
approach as in our preferred SIPP specification. However, as discussed above, there were substantial
policy changes to Medicare in the mid-2000s, including the introduction of Part D (and as a result, the
removal of prescription drug coverage from Medigap plans). Column 7 presents the estimate for the same
years used in the SIPP analysis; the estimated improvement of 0.182 health points is remarkably similar
to the SIPP estimate of 0.193, and statistically indistinguishable. Table 6 suggests that our results are not
dependent on any specific SIPP-related issues, and our estimated health improvement passes the
falsification tests, providing null estimates on untreated groups over the same time period. Furthermore,
our results are not dependent on the rescaling of the self-reported health measure.
We next turn to estimates based on the binary categorization of the self-reported health measure,
a common transformation of self-reported health (Manor, Matthews, and Power 2000). Table 7 shows
estimates on three such binary transformations: an indicator for being in poor or fair health, an indicator
for just being in poor health, and an indicator for whether the self-reported health is at least as good as in
last year’s interview. The latter definition requires limiting the analysis to under-65 Medicare
beneficiaries interviewed in two adjacent years; we also exclude individuals who reported poor health in
the first interview, since such individuals cannot have worse health. This latter measure is comparable to
the Baicker et al. (2013) measure of the impact of the Oregon Medicaid expansion on self-reported health,

wherein the estimated impact of expanded Medicaid coverage was an increased likelihood of reporting
same or better health of 7.84 percentage points.
Although the impact on the first outcome variable – reporting poor or fair health – is small
(approximately a 3-percentage point reduction in the least squares and probit average marginal effects
specifications) and not statistically significant, the majority of SSDI beneficiaries report being in one of
these two categories, and medical recovery among this population is generally rare (SSA 2016). Limiting
the analysis on the likelihood of reporting poor health, we estimate a decline of approximately 9
percentage points across both the least squares and probit marginal effects specifications, both highly
significant. Since the sample average is 20%, this effect is sizable. These two findings – a small,
statistically insignificant reduction in reporting poor or fair health and large, highly significant reduction
in reporting poor health – suggests that much of the estimated improvement in self-reported health of the
under-65 Medigap guaranteed issuance policy is in moving respondents from poor to fair health.
For the impact on same or improved health, the estimated effect is approximately 19-20
percentage points across the least squares and probit specifications, nearly three times the size of the
estimate from Baicker et al. (2013). Although this measure is constructed differently and limits its sample
to those not reporting poor health, who, the prior analyses suggest, likely experience the largest health
improvement, this estimate indicates that the impact of state-level Medigap policy on the health of the
under-65 Medicare population is large relative to other health insurance expansion margins, especially
given Medigap is a supplemental insurance policy.
Conclusion
This study examines the impact of state-level regulation of Medigap policies for under-65 Medicare
beneficiaries on these beneficiaries’ health. The overall finding is that when states require insurers to
issue Medigap plans to under-65 Medicare beneficiaries, their self-reported health is substantially higher.
This result is robust to alternative specifications and data sets, as well as to a range of falsification tests
and robustness checks. This effect is strongest for men, those with mental health conditions, and states
that also regulate the premiums that can be charged to under-65 Medicare beneficiaries.

However, future analyses may provide additional detail as to relevant mechanisms. Currently, the
inclusion of recent enrollment in MA and SNP plans as controls do not statistically impact our central
findings, but policy induced variation in these plans may uncover additional margins for health impacts
(Geruso and Layton 2015, Cabral et al. 2014).
Finally, although the SIPP data is publicly available, contains repeated health measures, elicits
SSDI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid coverage, and has geographic identifiers, it was not designed as a
health survey and does not elicit information on the type of Medicare supplementation beneficiaries have.
Future research will include drawing on the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to measure how state
policies and changes in MA and C-SNP availability change enrollment, utilization, and health, especially
for the populations potentially most affected by the availability and affordability of Medicare
supplementary options, such as those with chronic mental health conditions.
Overall, the size and robustness of the estimated effect indicates that the SSDI Medicare
population’s health is very sensitive to even supplemental coverage; that is, the policy variation in
question is over the remaining 20% coinsurance and insurance products that limit this cost sharing. The
size of the impact on changes in health indicates that state-level Medigap policy has not just a
comparable, but a substantially larger effect on health for under-65 Medicare beneficiaries than Medicaid
expansion on the marginal Oregon Medicaid entrant. Although this estimated effect on self-reported
health is large and robust, additional research is required to estimate the effects of these Medigap policies
on specific morbidity and mortality outcomes, as well as functional impairments and limitations to daily
living activities.
