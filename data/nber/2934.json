In addition to demonstrating that such mixed strategies can dominate both complete discretion and rigid adherence to the partially state contingent rule, we investigate the appropriate setting of parameters in a partially state contingent policy when it is acknowledged that the rule will not be followed on all occasions--i.e., that sometimes the monetary authority will resort to discretion.\n\n",
