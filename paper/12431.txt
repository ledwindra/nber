The Direct Substitution Between Government and Private Consumption in East Asia

NBER Working Paper No. 12431

JEL No. E6, H5
ABSTRACT
We investigate empirically the extent to which government consumption substitutes for private
consumption in nine East Asia countries. Panel cointegrating regression uncovers a significantly
positive elasticity of substitution between government and private consumption, implying on average
government and private consumption are substitutes in East Asia. Country-by-country analysis,
however, reveals diversity in the substitutability estimates. The four North East countries – China,
Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea – tend to share similar and moderate values of the substitution
elasticity. For the five ASEAN countries studied in this paper, the relationship between private and
government consumption vary substantially, both in the sign and magnitude of the elasticity of
substitution. Private and government consumption in Malaysia and Thailand are strong substitutes,
but they are found to be complements in Indonesia and Singapore. In between is the Philippines
which has a near zero elasticity of substitution.

1. Introduction
An important issue in the design of fiscal policy is the substitutability between
government and private consumption. If the private sector derives utility from
government–provided goods and services and regards private and government
consumption as close substitutes, an increase in government consumption will be offset
by a corresponding decrease in private consumption, rendering the size of the fiscal
multiplier relatively small and even potentially negative. On the other hand, if private and
government consumption are complements, an expansionary fiscal policy will be
relatively effective in stimulating aggregate demand as private consumption will
reinforce the initial fiscal impulse. While it is easy to give examples of individual private
and government goods that are substitutes or complements, it is an empirical question
whether aggregate private and government consumption are substitutes or complements
for a particular economy during certain period. The purpose of this paper is to empirically
study the substitutability issue for nine East Asian countries – the four northeast countries:
China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea, and the five southeast ASEAN countries:
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
Traditional macroeconomic models assume that government consumption works
through its impact on private consumption through wealth effect or interest rate effect.
Private consumption is crowded out either because the consumers may feel poorer as a
result of negative wealth effect or they may be induced to postpone consumption in
response to deficit–financed government spending. Bailey (1971) and Barro (1981) first
suggest incorporating government consumption into the representative agent decision
problem, making the public sector part of the general equilibrium system. The idea is that

1

many government goods are to some extent substitutes for private consumption goods.
Moreover, government purchases may also serve as useful inputs to the private
production function so that government consumption can be productive. This is in
contrast to the traditional models in which government consumption are regarded as
purely wasteful or unrelated to private consumption or production. In recent theoretical
literature, the interaction between government and private consumption has been assigned
a central role in the study of fiscal policy, in both the neoclassical real business cycle
fashion (e.g. Aiyagari et al. (1992) and Baxter and King (1993)) and the new Keynesian
fashion with monopolistic competition, increasing returns, and nominal rigidities (e.g.
Devereux et al. (1996) and Ganelli (2003)). However, depending on their assumptions
about market structure and technology, these models can predict totally different reaction
of private consumption in response to government spending shocks.
On the empirical front, a large literature has been developed to estimate the
relationship between government and private consumption. Kormendi (1983) and
Aschauer (1985) are representative of the earlier approach that relies on estimating a
consumption function. Karras (1994), Ni (1995), Evans and Karras (1996), and Fiorito
and Kollintzas (2004) are some of the more recent contributions along this approach. Ni’s
paper also provides a useful survey of the literature. The empirical analysis in this paper
follows Amano and Wirjanto (1997, 1998) who make use of the cointegration approach
of Ogaki (1992) and Ogaki and Park (1997) to estimate the preference parameter that
governs the relationship between government and private consumption. The idea is to
exploit the long–run restriction imposed by the intraperiod first–order condition that

2

characterizes the optimal choice of private and government consumption. Ho (2001),
Chiu (2001), and Okubo (2003) are some recent contributions along the same line.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical
model in detail. We provide a structural interpretation to the cointegrating regression
model by deriving it as an equilibrium condition. Section 3 provides a brief description of
government expenditures in East Asia. The data and empirical results are presented in
section 4. Section 5 concludes.

2. The empirical model

The empirical work in this paper centers around a cointegrating regression that
relates the logarithm of private and government consumption ratio, Ct / Gt , to the
logarithm of their relative price Pt g / Pt c :

(1)

ln(C t / Gt ) = α + β ln( Pt g / Pt c ) + ut

where ln(Ct / Gt ) and ln( Pt g / Pt c ) are both difference–stationary I(1) processes, and ut is
a stationary I(0) process. Formal statistical evidence for the cointegration property will be
provided below. The slope parameter β is the elasticity of substitution between private
and government consumption. A positive (negative) β means that the two goods are
substitutes (complements). One attractive feature of cointegrating regression is that the
slope parameters can be estimated consistently without the assumption that the regressors

3

are econometrically exogenous. In eq. (1), for example, β can still be estimated
consistently even though there may be stationary omitted variables or measurement errors.
So far eq. (1) is treated as a pure statistical relationship between the consumption
ratio of private and government goods and their relative prices. It is possible to provide
the equation a structural interpretation by deriving it as an equilibrium condition,
following the ideas of Ogaki (1992), Ogaki and Park (1997), and Ogaki and Reinhart
(1998). Assume that the representative consumer values two goods, private and
government, according to an expected life–time utility function subject to stationary
preference shocks:

(2)

U = Et [

∞
j =0

δ j u (Ct + j *)]

where

(3)

Ct * = [φε t Ct1−(1/ σ ) + (1 − φ )ν t Gt1−(1/ σ ) ]1/[1− (1/ σ )]

(ε t ,ν t ) are random preference shocks which are assumed to be strictly stationary, have
unit mean and finite variances. The stationarity assumption amounts to say preferences
are stable in the long run. The period utility function is assumed to possess the usual
properties u '> 0 and u '
'< 0. (φ , σ ) are preference parameters which characterize the
representative agent’s utility function: φ is the relative weight assigned to private goods
and σ is the substitution parameter which measures the curvature of the indifference

4

curves. Given time–separability of the utility function, the optimal consumption bundle
will have to satisfy the equality between marginal rate of substitution and relative price:

(4)

∂U / ∂Gt ν t (1 − φ )Gt −1/ σ Pt g
≡
= c
ε tφ Ct −1/ σ
∂U / ∂Ct
Pt

Taking logarithm and rearranging yields

(5)

ln(Ct / Gt ) = −σ ln[(1 − φ ) / φ ] + σ ln( Pt g / Pt c ) − σ ln(ν t / ε t )

Stable preferences implies that the residual term, −σ ln(ν t / ε t ), is stationary and hence eq.
(5) should be a cointegrating regression, provided that log consumption ratio, ln(Ct / Gt ),
and log price ratio, ln( Pt g / Pt c ), are both I(1) processes. In other words, the stable
preferences assumption, together with the consumer optimality condition in eq. (4),
imposes a cointegration restriction on the movements of the log consumption ratio and
the log price ratio series. Eq. (5) provides a structural interpretation to eq. (1) which can
be regarded as the reduced form equation with parameters and residuals related to their
structural counterpart via the relationships

(6)

α = −σ ln[(1 − φ ) / φ ], β = σ , ut = −σ ln(ν t / ε t )

Notice that eq. (5) is a theoretical demand equation, whereas eq. (1) is an
empirical equation describing the equilibrium quantities and prices. Just like the classical

5

supply–and–demand simultaneous equation model, interpreting eq. (1) as the demand
equation requires identification assumption. In general, to identify the demand equation,
we need variability from the supply side and the demand side should be relatively stable.
Since the supply side has to do with production which is subject to technological
improvement, it is reasonable to expect the quantity supplied series should be highly
persistent which can be modeled as a stochastic trend. The demand side, on the other
hand, has to do with taste and it is reasonable to expect preference shocks are relatively
stable in comparison with technological shocks. In the context of demand analysis, Ogaki
(1992) has shown formally that the assumptions of stable preferences and a stochastic
trend in the quantity supplied are sufficient to ensure identification of a cointegrating
demand equation like eq. (1).
In the theoretical analyses of Bailey (1971) and Barro (1981), followed by the
empirical work of Kormendi (1983), Aschauer (1985), Evans and Karras (1996), among
many others, the effective consumption is specified as a weighted average of private and
government consumption:

(7)

Ct * = Ct + θ Gt

In this setup each unit of government goods is equivalent to units of private goods,
irrespective of the current consumption level of the two goods. In other words, the
indifference curves for the two goods are linear which corresponds to the extreme case of

σ = +∞ in the CES aggregator function in eq. (3). Clearly this is an empirically
restrictive assumption, albeit a convenient one for analytical tractability.

3. Government expenditures in East Asia

Table 1 reports a summary of the government expenditures by economic type (in
percentage of GDP) for the Asian countries studied in this paper, together with the
corresponding figures for the United States for comparison. The data source is World
Bank (2004) which in turn is based on the primitive data in the IMF Government
Financial Statistics Yearbook. Total government outlays comprise of government
purchase of goods and services, wages and salaries for government employees, public
capital investment, transfer payments, and interest payments of outstanding government
debts. In terms of total outlays, the governments of the Asian countries are comparable in
size to that of the United States, except for the Malaysia government which stands out as
the outlier of the group. The pattern of government expenditures among the Asian
countries is more heterogeneous. Japan and Korea seem to differ from the rest of the
Asian countries and their government expenditure patterns are broadly comparable to that
of the United States. The governments of Hong Kong and the five ASAEN countries, on
the other hand, spend relatively more on goods and services and on government
employee payroll. Table 1 also reveals that the Asian governments devote considerable
amount of resources on capital investments, presumably most are on public infrastructure
and, for the five ASEAN countries, also on national enterprises. This is in sharp contrast
to the United States in which public investment is only 1% of GDP. Among the heavy
public investors, the Indonesian government stands out as the largest by devoting 6.9% of
GDP to public investment, followed by Thailand (6.5%), Singapore (5.0%), and Malaysia
(4.8%). Another noteworthy component is transfer payments. The transfer payments of

7

the Asian governments are all relatively low comparing with the corresponding US figure
of 12.3%, with Japan and Korea register the highest government transfers in the 8 to 9 %
range and Thailand reports the lowest transfers of only 1.3% of GDP. Clearly the low
transfers in the ASEAN countries and Hong Kong reflect the relatively under–developed
social security system and other formal welfare schemes.

4. Empirical results

We use annual data for 1960–2002 from the World Development Indicators
(World Bank, 2004) whenever possible to ensure cross–country compatibility. Missing or
erroneous entries are reconstructed from local sources. Private and government
consumption are taken to be the relevant expenditure series from the National Income and
Product Accounts (NIPA). The consumption ratio, Ct / Gt , is calculated from the constant
price private and government consumption series. The two price series, Pt g and Pt c , are
simply the respective implicit price deflators constructed by dividing the nominal series
by the constant price counterpart.

Insert Figure 1 here

Insert Table 2 here

8

We begin by examining the time series properties of the log consumption ratio
series, ln(Ct / Gt ), and the log price ratio series, ln( Pt g / Pt c ). Figure 1 depicts the two
series for all nine Asian countries. The strong persistency and co-movements of the two
series are clearly discernable from the plots, giving an initial impression that they are
likely to be I(1) and cointegrated. Table 2 reports formal panel unit root test results. It is
well known that unit root tests have low power and the problem may be even worse for
our application as we have short time series. To better utilize sample information, we
pool the nine countries’ data to perform panel unit root tests, which have been shown to
be more powerful than the individual time series version. All three panel unit root tests
draw the same conclusion: the unit root null hypothesis is not rejected for the level series
but is strongly rejected for the first–differenced series. This shows that the log
consumption ratio and the log price ratio series are indeed I(1). Moreover, the asymmetry
of the p–values for the level series in the IPS test and the ADF-Fisher chi-square test
suggest that log consumption ratio is the less integrated series – in the sense that it has a
weaker random walk component – than the log price ratio. This has important
implications to the specification of the cointegrating regression. It is well known that
cointegrating regression is not invariant to normalization choice –– deciding which
variable to put on the left hand side as the regressand – and different choices may imply
different estimates for the same parameter. For example, instead of running regression eq.
(1), we could have run the reverse regression with the log price ratio normalized as the
regressand to obtain an estimate of (1/ β ). In finite sample the estimates from the direct
and reverse regressions may be far from being reciprocal to each other and they can also
have drastically different statistical properties. According to Ng and Perron (1997), in the

9

context of cointegrating regression, it is preferable to put the less integrated series as the
regressand and the more integrated series as the regressor. Applying the Ng–Perron rule,
this means that designating the log consumption ratio series as the regressand as in eq. (1)
is indeed the right choice.

Insert Table 3 here

Table 3 reports panel estimation results for eq. (1) with country specific fixed
effects. The cointegration property of eq. (1) is confirmed by the two panel cointegration
tests: the null hypothesis of no cointegration is decisively rejected by Kao’s (1999) ADF
test but the null of cointegration cannot be rejected according to the McCoskey and Kao
(1998) LM test. Turning to the elasticity of substitution between private and government
consumption –– the coefficient of ln( Pt g / Pt c ) –– it can be seen that the estimates are all
significantly positive, ranging between 0.57 and 1.05 with small standard errors, and
varying across different estimation methods and sample periods. The empirical results
suggest that on average private and government consumption in East Asia are substitutes
with an elasticity of substitution midway between 0.5 and 1.
We also estimate an unrestricted version of eq. (1) as a simple specification check:

(8)

ln(C t / Gt ) = α + β1 ln( Pt g ) + β 2 ln( Pt c ) + ut

Eq. (1) is a restricted version of eq. (8) with β1 + β 2 = 0. Estimates of β1 and β 2 that are
similar in magnitude but opposite in sign provide evidence in favor of the restriction and

10

hence eq. (1). As can be seen from Table 3, the pattern of the parameter estimates is in
general supportive of eq. (1); and the evidence is especially strong when all nine Asian
countries are included in the sample for the period 1978–2002 (Panel B). According to
the fully efficient DOLS estimates, government and private consumption in East Asia
during 1978-2002 have a substantial degree of substitutability with an elasticity of
substitution around 1, implying a Cobb-Douglas aggregator function for eq. (3).
From a policy perspective, the panel estimate may not be of much practical
relevance, as it tells us little about any individual country. Table 4 therefore reports
cointegrating regression results for the nine Asian countries individually. We also report
the corresponding results for the United States for comparison. To check robustness, we
try three different estimation methods which are all asymptotically efficient procedures
for estimating cointegration regressions. The three methods are Phillips and Hansen
(1990) fully modified ordinary least square (FM-OLS), Park (1992) canonical
cointegrating regression (CCR), and Stock and Watson (1993) dynamic ordinary least
squares (DOLS). In general the parameter estimates are stable across the three estimation
methods. Comparing the DOLS estimates of the elasticity of substitution across countries,
Malaysia and Thailand come up with the highest values of 1.66 and 1.51, respectively,
which are comparable to the value of 1.5 of the United States. On the other extreme are
Indonesia and Singapore for which the negative elasticities of substitution of –0.92 and
–1.76, respectively, imply that private and government consumption are strong
complements. The four North East Asian countries, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea,
share a moderate elasticity of substitution ranging from 0.41 in Hong Kong to 0.65 in
China. The Philippines, on the other hand, has a numerically small and statistically

11

insignificant elasticity of substitution of 0.07, indicating little substitution in private and
government consumption.

Insert Table 4 here

Indonesia and Thailand provide an interesting case of contrast. The estimated
elasticity of substitution between private and government consumption is –0.92 for
Indonesia and 1.51 for Thailand. Government consumption is a strong substitute to
private consumption in Thailand, implying that a fiscal contraction that makes
government goods relatively more expensive will induce substantial expansion in private
consumption, thereby offsetting or even outweighing the negative impact of the fiscal
contraction on aggregate demand. The Indonesian government consumption, in contrast,
is a strong complement to private consumption, implying that a fiscal contraction that
makes government goods relatively more expensive will generate a large negative income
effect that outweighs the substitution effect, leading to a concomitant contraction in
private consumption expenditure that further depresses aggregate demand. These
predictions about the two economies’ reaction to fiscal austerity seem to be consistent
with what have been observed during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Insert Table 5 here

What explains the cross-country diversity in the substitution between private and
government consumption? In their international study, Evans and Karras (1996) find a

12

statistically significant negative relationship between the share of government
expenditure that goes to national defense and the degree of substitutability between
private and government consumption. The idea is that the higher is the defense share, the
higher is the public goods component in government consumption which reduces its
ability to substitute for private consumption. In Table 5 we collect together for the nine
East Asia countries their national defense expenditure shares, education expenditure
shares, and estimated elasticities of substitution between private and government
consumption. The entries are sorted by the substitution elasticities for ease of comparison.
Apparently neither the education share nor the defense share can explain the empirical
pattern of the substitution elasticities for all nine countries. However, the correlation
between the defense shares and substitution elasticities is –0.24, confirming the empirical
findings of Evans and Karras (1996). The strong complementarity between private and
government consumption in Singapore seems to be testimonial to the Evans–Karras story,
in view of the favorable international ratings of the Singaporean education system and
other infrastructure, and the government’s well documented role in the country’s
economic success (e.g. Low (1998) and Krause et al. (1987)). The case of Indonesia may
appear to be defiant of the Evans–Karras explanation: the expenditures on education and
defense are only moderate and yet private and government consumption appear to be
complements, according to the negative sign of the substitution elasticity. One potential
explanation is the well known fact that the Indonesian government heavily subsidies the
private sector including fuel, electricity, fertilizer and other basic goods, and these
subsidies are complementary to other goods in the private consumption bundle; see for
example Hill (1996, 1999) and World Bank (2006). When the Indonesian government

13

adjusts these subsidies in tandem with the overall government spending, this will generate
the observed co–movements of private and government consumption that gives rise to the
estimated negative elasticity of substitution.

5. Conclusion

In this paper we have estimated the degree of substitution between private and
government consumption in nine East Asia countries. On average there is substantial
substitutability between private and government consumption, implying there will be
direct crowding out of private consumption by government consumption. Such direct
crowding out effect will reinforce the conventional interest rate and wealth effect
crowding out channels to make fiscal policy relatively ineffective in East Asia. We also
find that the substitutability between private and government consumption varies among
the Asian countries. Government and private consumption turn out to be complements in
Indonesia and Singapore, but they are substitutes in other Asian countries with different
degrees of substitutability. There is no obvious quantitative variable that can explain each
country’s empirical estimates, although the share of government expenditure that goes to
education and national defense seems to be negatively correlated with substitutability.
Future study on this issue will need a more careful examination of each country’s
institutional details – one will have to understand what sort of government services those
public consumption figures represent – before further conclusion can be drawn.
