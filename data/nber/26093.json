    "abstract": "\n\nPolitical debates around environmental regulation often center around the effect of policy on jobs. Opponents decry the \u201cjob-killing\u201d EPA and proponents point to \u201cgreen jobs\u201d as a positive policy outcome. And beyond the political debates, Congress requires the EPA to evaluate \u201cpotential losses or shifts of employment\u201d that regulations under the Clean Air Act may cause. Yet there is a sharp disconnect between the political importance of the jobs question and the limited research on job effects of policy and general skepticism in the academic literature about the importance of those job effects for the costs and benefits of environmental regulation.\nIn this paper, we discuss how the existing research on jobs and environmental regulations often falls short in evaluating these questions and consider recent new work that has attempted to address these problems.  We provide an intuitive discussion of key questions for how job effects should enter into economic analysis of regulations.  And, using an economic model from Hafstead, Williams, and Chen (2018), we evaluate a range of environmental regulations in both the short and long-run to develop a set of key stylized facts related to jobs and environmental regulations and to identify the key questions that current models can\u2019t yet answer well.\n\n",
