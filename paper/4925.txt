November 1994
DO PENSIONS INCREASE THE
LABOR SUPPLY OF OLDER MEN?

ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the relationship between pension coverage and the retirement
behavior of older men. Pensions are associated with higher work involvement for males in their

late fifties and early sixties but with lower rates of job holding for those aged 65 through 69.
Age of entry into pension employment is shown to be positively correlated with future labor
supply. When combined with evidence on age-specific changes in labor force participation rates,
this pattern casts doubt on the hypothesis that broadened pension coverage explains a substantial

portion of the tend toward earlier male retirement.

Do Pensions Increase

the Labor Supply of Older Men?

The labor force participation rates of older males have dramatically
declined in the United States since the end of World War II, falling from 90%
to 67% for 55 to 64 year olds and from 47% to 16% for those over 65 between

1948 and 1993 (U.S. Department of Labor, 1989, 1994). In explaining this
reduction, economists have recently focused attention on the role of private

pensions.1 Pensions often contain complicated incentives which encourage
workers to remain with the pension provider at some ages but to leave those

jobs subsequently. These incentives are typically strongest for defined
benefit (OS) plans, where pension payments depend on some combination of
seniority and earnings, and often include vesting periods, early retirement
options, and social security offsets.2
The actuarial value of pensions is frequently maximized at fairly young

ages.3 The changes in pension incentives, occurring with age and length—ofservice, can be extremely large and there is strong evidence that workers

respond to these incentives.4 Furthermore, the number of full—time private
wage and salary workers covered by pension plans more than doubled between

supply trends of older men and women. Earlier research on retirement
emphasized mandatory retirement provisions, health limitations. changea in
wealth and earnings, and social security system incentives. For literature

68% of pension—covered workers were enrolled in primary DB plans in 1987,
a reduction from 87% in 1975 (Belier & Lawrence, 1992). Some of these persons
received supplemental coverage from defined contribution (DC) plans.
Kotlikof I & Smith (1983) found that half of civilian employees could
retire at 62 and 15% by age 55, with no actuarial reduction in pension
benefits. Similarly, in Mitchell & Fields' (1984) survey of 10 pension plans,
lifetime benefits were maximized at 62 or earlier in 9 of plans and by age 60
in 5. Mitchell (1992) shows that the early retirement incentives became still
more prevalent during the decade of the 1980s.

For instance, in their case study of one large firm, Rotlikoff & Wise
(1989) calculate the accrual to pension wealth for an additional year of
service at $72,527 for 54 year old managers with 25 years seniority but
negative $14,936 for 65 year olds with 30 years on the job. They estimate
that workers were 30 percentage points more likely to depart the firm prior to
age 60 (44% vs. 14%) than if the company had offered an age-neutral pension

plan.

1950 and 1975, rising from 26% to 52% (Turner & Belier, 1989) .

Although

coverage rates have been static in recent years, the number of retirees with

pensions continues to increase. Many economists have concluded that this
combination of pension incentives and expanding coverage rates is responsible
for a significant share of the secular decline in the labor force
participaticn of older American men.

As suggested by its title, this paper questions this conclusion and
argues that the effects of pensions are far more complicated than is commonly

understood. Although pensions hasten the retirements of some workers, they
delay the labor force withdrawal of others and so the net impact on retirement
ages is not clear.

Pensions have ambiguous impacts for at least three reasons. First,
departures from covered jobs may be followed by subsequent full or part-time
work, rather than immediate retirement, thus moderating the effects of the

pension incentives.5 second, the incentives to leave the firm prior to normal
retirement ages are likely to be limited to persons entering the pension plan
at relatively young ages, since vesting provisions and length—of—service
requirements often discourage early departures for persons beginning pension-

covered employment later in life.6 Third, even for persons entering covered
employment at relatively young ages, defined benefit plans are likely to
discourage mobility prior to the age at which actuarial benefits are maximized
(Allen et. al., 1993; Gustman & Steinmeier, 1990), reducing the probability of
early, as well as late, retirement.7

Continued work after the end of pension employment deserves greater
attention in light of recent research (e.g. Gustman & Steirimeier, 1984; Honig
& Reimers, 1987; Quinn, et. al. 1990; Rubm, 1990, 1991; Slau, 1994) indicating
the prevalence of postcareer employment and partial retirement.

pensions are associated with increased labor supply for men in

their late fifties and early sixties but with reductions in employment and

work hours after age 64. Delayed entry into pension jobs correlates with
higher labor supply among mature males and the pattern of age—specific changes
in labor force participation rates casts doubt on the hypothesis that
broadened pension coverage accounts for a major portion of the trend towards
earlier male retirement.

1. Pension coverage and Retirement Ages
This section examines the relationship expected between pension coverage

and retirement ages.8 Following Mitchell &

Fields

(1984), V is the discounted

value of lifetime compensation, L the number of periods of retirement, and T
and R

the

ages of death and retirement respectively. Specifying Y and P as

the discounted values of lifetime earnings and pension benefits, workers
choose retirement ages to maximize the utility function U(V,L), subject to the
time constraint L = T —

R

and

the budget constraint V

'1 +

P.

Retirement therefore occurs at:
R

argmax (J[V(t),L(t)].
t

from a DB to a DC plan. If the employer contributes to the latter plan at a
rate such that the annuity value for a 60 year old worker with 30 years of
service is the same as for the DB plan, annual retirement probabilities are
calculated to rise prior to age 59, fall between 59 and 64 and increase at
ages 65 and 66. Because of the high propensities to leave the firm at
relatively young ages, however, cumulative retirement probabilities are raised
at all ages studied. Simulations for a second firm by Lumadaine, Stock, &
Wise (1994) similarly indicate that switching from a DB to a DC plan would
increase retirements through age 58 and then lower them subsequently.
The

results below do not depend upon a specific definition of retirement.

The effect of pensions on retirement ages can be examined by comparing
persons obtaining covered positions in the first period of work to those

employed in non-covered jobs their entire working lives. The latter group are
paid their marginal product, y0(t), and receive no pension. If total
compensation is the same in pension covered positions as in noncovered
employment, y(t)i-P

independent of y and pensions will have no effect on retirement behavior. It
is only when pay in pension jobs differs from that in corresponding noncovered
positions that labor supply may be affected.
For instance, assume that the compensation of covered workers, at time t,
exceeds that of noncovered individuals by a positive differential ir(t)

This implies that retirement occurs when the marginal utility of earnings
is exactly offset by the disutility of lost leisure.

In this situation, pensions may either hasten or delay retirement.

Covered workers receive higher lifetime compensation, creating an income

effect which lowers

(if

c 0) and speeds withdrawal from the labor

force. Compensation is also greater by w(Q) at Q, however, generating an
offsetting substitution effect. The ambiguous impact of pensions occurs even
if the actuarial value of pension wealth is declining over time. Although
covered workers exit the labor force earlier than if pensions were actuarially
neutral and earnings

remained unchanged, with competitive labor markets,

the

wage and pension profiles are inextricably linked.
There are a number of reasons to expect higher compensation in pension

covered employment. Compensation premia and pension coverage may go together
in unionized employment. Pay differentials could also exist with competitive
labor and product markets. For instance, pensions might be provided, as a
means of preventing shirking, in jobs where output is sensitive to effort.
The intuition is that effort will only be maximized if sufficiently large

costs are imposed for detected shirking. As retirement approaches, the
penalty must take the form of reduced pension benefits, since the number of

periods over which earnings can be decreased is small. Pension jobs will also
be rationed because new job entrants will not have built up sufficient
deferred payments and so will have incentives to shirk if they can immediately

reenter a new pension jobJ0
If jobs offering pension pay more than those that do not, persons will
repeatedly attempt to obtain covered employment and there will be

heterogeneity in the age of entry into the pension sector.11 In this

these characteristics.

11 several types of evidence suggest that pension jobs offer pay premiums.
Gustman & Steinmeier (1990) indicate that turnover rates are lower in jobs
providing pensions because total compensation is substantially higher in these
positions. Similarly, Ellwood (1985) shows that pension coverage is

situation, late entrants are likely to retire after their counterparts

starting in pension employment at younger ages. This occurs because the
substitution effect is equally strong for the two groups, whereas early
entrants have higher lifetime incomes and a larger (negative) income effect.12
To summarize, pension coverage may be associated with either early or
late retirement, depending on the strength of the offsetting income and

substitution effects. Among workers ever employed in covered jobs, the ages
of entry into pension employment and of retirement should be positively

correlated. A key condition required to generate this result is that total
compensation is higher in covered than noncovered positions.

2. Data
Data for this study were obtained from the Social Security Administration
Retirement History Longitudinal Survey (RHS) .

The PBS contains a

representative national sample (for the United States) of males aged 58
through 63 in 1969, the initial survey year, with follow-up interviews at two

year intervals through 1979. The sample analyzed includes non—self-employed
men whose longest job was in the private sector.13 Data were pooled across
RUS survey years to increase the sample sizes of respondents of given ages.14
Fairly detailed information is available on labor force histories during
the survey period (1969 to 1979), as is less specific data for the presurvey

disproportionately obtained by highly paid and highly educated workers and is
relatively rarely supplied to disadvantaged labor market groups. He also
provides evidence of the dispersion of entry ages into pension employment.

12 Since D(R0,o) = 0, D(R011) > 0, for v > 0 (and u c 0), which implies
that retirement ages rise with the age of entry into the pension sector.

13 women were excluded because information on unmarried females is
extremely limited in the PBS.

14 For example, data on 63 year olds was obtained from the 1969, 1971, and
1973 interviews. Cohort differences were tested for in preliminary analysis
but are not accounted for in the estimates presented below.

years. Importantly, it is possible to ascertain whether the individual was
covered by a pension plan in up to three jobs: the job (if any) held at the
time of the 1969 interview, the employment held iwnediately previously, and
the longest job, if different from survey date and previous employment.

Men working at the 1969 survey date were defined as having pensions if
covered in any of the three jobs for which information is available and to

lack coverage if none of the three positions provided pensions. The pension
status of men not employed in 1969 was determined according to whether or not

the predominance of defined benefit pensions during the survey period. Third,
some workers may have obtained coverage in jobs for which the RHS obtains no
information or have been employed with firms providing pension plans for which
they ultimately did not qualify for benefits.
Despite these deficiencies, the RES is a useful data set to analyze
because it contains a larger representative sample of retirement age men and
better retrospective information on presurvey employment than most other

Economists have variously defined retirement as occurring when
individuals classify themselves as retired, receive public or private pension
benefits, experience a discontinuous reduction in earnings or hours worked, or

exit the labor force, The last criteria is implicitly used when considering
the relationship between pension coverage and labor force participation rates

and ignores any impact of pensions on positive work hours. To avoid depending
on a single definition, four alternative measures of labor supply are

considered below. The first three are dummy variables indicating whether the
individual does not work, works full—time (more than 35 hours per week) •

or is

employed in a career' job (defined as a position which has lasted at least 10
years) .

The fourth is a continuous indicator of weekly hours of work.

nonemployment probabilities are somewhat higher than corresponding national

nonparticipation rates.17 This is partially explained by the exclusion of
unemployed workers from the latter measure.

Figures 1 through 4 summarize information on the relationship between
pension status and the alternative measures of labor supply for 58 through 68

year old men. The patterns are fairly consistent and quite striking. Between

16 The legal minimum mandatory retirement age was raised from 65 to 70 by
the 1978 amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and has now
been eliminated for most workers.

17 For example, 17% and 18% of 58 and 59 year old RHS respondents were not
working at the survey date in 1969. The corresponding national
nonparticipation rates were 11% and 13%, in that year.

the ages of 58 and 61, pension—covered males are substantially more involved

in the labor force than their counterparts. Differences of 7 to 14 and 9 to
17 percentage points are observed in the probabilities of working and of

holding full-time employment respectively. Men with pensions are also 22 to
27 percentage points more likely to remain on career positions and average 4
to 5 more hours per week on the job.

By contrast, the employment probabilities and average work hours of 62 to

64 year old men are virtually unrelated to pension coverage. Small
differentials are still observed; however, when considering the probability of
working full—time (3 to 6 percentage points) and particularly of continuing on
the career job (6 to 13 percentage points).

Beyond age 64, pensions are associated with significantly reduced labor

supply. For example, whereas 74% of covered 65 year olds did not work, 20%
were employed more than 35 hours per week, 12% held career jobs, and weekly
employment averaged 10 hours, the corresponding figures for 65 year old men
without pensions were 61%, 26%. 17%, and 14 hours per week respectively.
Pensions continue to be correlated with reduced labor supply through age 68.

To examine whether these patterns persist after controlling for
observable characteristics, probit models of the form;

After estimating (5) and (6), the average effect of pensions on the

various measures of labor supply was calculated. The first three columns of
table 2 present the predicted impact on nonemployment, full—time work, and
career job-holding probabilities, while column 4 displays the corresponding

differential in weekly work hours.18 For example, the first row of the table

The results in table 2 are similar to those obtained without controls for

individual characteristics. Specifically, pensions correlate with increased
labor supply prior to age 62, with lower work propensities after 65, and with

small differences for 62 through 64 year olds. Thus, pension coverage was

corresponding changes in full-time work propensities averaged 9, 0, and —7
percentage points, for the three age groups, while the mean differences in
career job holding and weekly work hours were 21, 5, and -s

and 1.5,

-2.3, and -4.1 hours respectively.

These findings show that estimated pension effects vary with age and are

sensitive to the measure of labor supply used. They further suggest that it
may be problematic to use only a single criteria (e.g. participation rates)

when evaluating the impact of pensions. For example, averaged over the 58 to
68 year age range, pensions are predicted to decrease employment probabilities
and average hours worked but also to slightly increase the frequency of fulltime employment and to considerably raise the likelihood of remaining in a
career job.

into the pension sector and labor supply of mature adults.
20 Compensation could be equal even when the average earnings of covered

workers exceed those of persons without pensions if pensions are provided as a
compensating differential in jobs with particularly unpleasant working
conditions or if more productive workers choose to take a larger proportion of
their pay in the form of fringe benefits.

—12—

To test whether later entry into pension employment is associated with
elevated labor supply in late middle age, the probit and tobit models
specified by equations (5) and (6) were reestimated. with the addition of a

covariate indicating the commencement age of the covered job. Results of
these regressions, summarized in table 3, support the hypothesized

relationship, at least for ages 62 and older. A one year delay in entering
the pension job reduces the probability of nonemployment by 0.1 to 0.7
percentage points, depending on the exact age considered (see column 1) .

The

corresponding increase in work hours ranges from —0.06 to 0.26 hours per week
and the probability of working full—time rises by as much as 0.6 percentage

Postponed entry into pension employment has particularly pronounced
effects for 62 through 66 year olds, with a smaller impact continuing through

age 68. For example, a one standard deviation (12.5 year) delay in starting
the pension job raises predicted employment rates by 5.2 percentage points at

age 62, 7.8 percentage points at 65, and 3.0 points at 68. corresponding
increases in the probabilities of working full—time are 4.6, 6.5, and 2.4

percentage points, respectively. Persons entering covered jobs after their
early (middle) forties are more likely to be working or employed full-time at
age 62 (64) than their counterparts never obtaining pensions.

Ags-sp.cif Sc Chango in Labor Pores Participation

If broadening pension coverage plays a key role in explaining the secular

decline in the labor force participation rates of older men, the decreases

persons

recently beginning pension employment will automatically be precluded
from holding career jobs. When the sample is restricted to persons starting

jobs for most age groups.

—13—

would probably be most

pronounced

for men aged 6S and above. This would be

expected since pensions are associated with the greatest reductions in labor

surply for this group. Smaller declines would then be anticipated for younger
workers for whom pensions have more modest negative impacts or are correlated

with increased work involvement. Surprisingly, scant attention has been paid
to the pattern of age-specific changes in participation rates.22
The first three columns of table 4 indicate levels and changes in

participation rates for men between the ages of 58 and 68. This information
was obtained from unpublished U.S. Department of Labor data and is presented
as three-year averages for periods centered around the dates listed in the
table (e.g. column 1 presents average rates for the years 1968 through 1970)

The use of three-year averages minimizes the (sometimes considerable) effects
of year-to-year variations in labor force participation.
The second column shows changes in average participation rates occurring

between 1969 and 1979, the period covered by the RHS survey. Column 3
displays corresponding changes taking place between 1969 and 1988. Thus, the
labor force participation rate of 58 year old males averaged 891 during the
three-year period centered around 1969 and fell by $ and 10 percentage points

The participation rate of 58 to 68 year old men fell by an average of

13 percentage points between 1969 and 1979 and by 18 points over the 1969 to
1988 interval.23

"Relative changes" in participation rates, shown in columns 4 and

S of

the table, were next calculated by taking the difference between the change

for the particular age group and the average reduction for all 58 to 68 year

olds. For instance, the 10 percentage point decrease in the labor force
participation races of 58 year olds, between 1969 and 1980, represents a
growth of 7 points (—0.104 - —0.178

0.074) relative to the average for all

58 to 68 year olds. The sixth column displays the predicted effect of pension
coverage on the probability that RBS respondents worked positive hours at

specific ayes. These estimates were obtained by reversing the sign of the
nonemployment effects displayed in column 1 of table 2.
The table shows that 62 to 64 year olds experienced the largest declines
in participation (columns 4 and 5) .

At

these ages, however, pensions were

correlated with (at most) only modest reductions in labor supply (column 6) -

conversely,

the pension disincentives were concentrated among 65 to 68 year

olds, for whom the declines in aggregate participation rates were much
smaller.

These results suggest that broadened pension coverage is unlikely to
explain much of the trend towards earlier male retirement but do not rule out

other roles for pensions. Since coverage rates grew rapidly between 1950 and
1975, recent cohorts will have been enrolled in pension plans for longer

periods of time than their previous counterparts at equivalent ages. This
could lead to a reduction in the age of peak pension wealth and disincentives

for continued work. Second, even holding entry ages into the pension sector
constant, the characteristics of Dli plans appear to have changed over time in

ways that encourage earlier retirement.24

6. Conclusions
Previous research suggests that private pensions reduce the labor supply
of mature adults and, when combined with higher rates of coverage, may account

prior to 65 rose from 4% in 1970 to 15% in 1985 (Ippolito, 1990) .

for an important share of the secular decline in the labor force participation

rates of older men. This paper questions these conclusions, arguing that
pensions are likely to reduce labor supply at some ages but to increase it at
others, resulting in a more complicated and ambiguous aggregate impact than is
frequently realized.

Empirically, pension coverage is associated with higher labor supply for
RHS respondents in their fifties to early sixties, with negligible or small
effects for men aged 62 to 64, and

with

large negative impacts among 65 to 69

year olds. Disparate results are obtained using alternative measures of labor
supply, suggesting shortcomings with relying on any single criteria. The miS
data also provide strong evidence that the labor supply of mature males is

positively correlated with the commencement age of pension employment. This
last result is anticipated if pay premiums are provided in pension jobs and is
may be inconsistent with theories which require equality of compensation
across the covered and noncovered sectors.
The evidence that pension effects vary with age may

explain

why earlier

analysis which constrains the impact to be constant (e.g. Hanoch & Honig.

L983; Elau, 1994) frequently uncovers a negative relationship between pensions

and work propensities.25 The age variation also raises the possibility of
important interactions between private pensions and other forms of retirement

wealth, such as Social Security. Recent research (e.g. Samwick, 1993;
Luinridairie, Stock, & wise, 1994; Ruhm, 1994b) suggests that these interactions

may be important

but provides little consensus on the direction or timing of

the effects.

Luzadis (1988) and Luzadis & Mitchell (1991) provide additional evidence that
the age of maximum pension wealth has been falling over time.

25 Gordon & Blinder's (1900) analysis of age—specific pension effects,
using the miS, obtain results consistent with those reported in this paper.

The age pattern of changes in labor force participation rates also casts
doubt on the hypothesis that broader pension coverage explains a substantial

portion of the trend reduction in male retirement ages. Whereas the age—
specific decreases in participation are largest for 62 to 64 year olds, the
negative impact of pensions is most pronounced among men between the ages of

65 and 68. These divergent patterns do not rule out a role for pensions, and
in particular do not account for secular changes in the age-profile of pension
accruals; however, a closer correspondence would be expected if increases in
private

pension coverage are of primary importance.

Previous research on pensions has

incentives

typically

focused on the microeconomic

implicit in pension plans. Plan incentives are only one component

of total compensation, however, and the latter are determined in the larger

labor market. Thus, pensions could contain incentives which discourage
continued employment of persons enrolled in the plans, while having no
aggregate effecc on or even increasing average retirement ages.
The age of entry into pension employment has a substantial impact on

subsequent labor supply. This highlights the importance of better
understanding the process by which workers obtain jobs offering pensions.
Subsequent empirical work also needs to investigate the dynamics of entry into
and exit out of pension employment, the role of worker heterogeneity in
determining pension coverage, and the relationship between the broad labor
supply effects focused upon in this paper and the results obtained from
detailed analyses of individual plans.

Future research should also attempt to ascertain the applicability of
this and previous studies for the áohort of workers who are currently

approaching retirement. Significant differences could result from the greater

-17--

use of defined contribution pension plans, an economic environment which is
increasingly characterized by stagnant earnings and high rates of labor
displacement, and the rising labor force involvement of women and other groups
receiving limited attention in prior work.

Note: Coefficients show the average effect of pension coverage on the
dependent variable. Columns (1) through (3) are obtained by estimating
probit models of the form Pr(Z 1) = t(Xa + fiP). with predicted pension
effects calculated as the difference in the average values of t(Xa +
and •(X.a), where a and

are probit coefficients. Estimates in column
4) are 2rom a corresponding Tobit model. The dependent variable is hours
worked and predicted effects are calculated as +(X'a + p's), where X'
and P are sample means and • (.) shows the estimated probability that an
observation is censored. Estimates are separately obtained for each age
group and control for marital status, years of education, race (white vs.
nonwhite), household status (head vs. nonhead), whether the individual
resides in an SMSA, and pension coverage. Absolute value of t statistics
are shown in parentheses.

Note: See note on table 2. For the probit estimates, predicted effects are
calculated as the average change in the outcome variable, for persons with
pension coverage, from delaying the start of coverage from the sample mean
age it begins until one year later. For the Tobit model they are estimated
as t(.), for 5 the coefficient on the age of first pension coverage and
'H.) the predicted probability that an observation is censored, with the
regressors evaluated at their sample means.
