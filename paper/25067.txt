The Pivotal Role of Fairness: Which Consumers Like Annuities?

ABSTRACT
Life annuities can be a valuable component of the decumulation stage of wealth during
retirement. While economists argue that most retirees should annuitize, actual demand in the
marketplace is low. We analyze data from two studies to determine how measurable individual
differences among consumers affect their interest in annuities. We find that a relatively high
percentage of respondents dislike all annuities. Demographic factors are not predictive of which
individuals dislike annuities, and individual factors predicted by economic models to be
important (such as beneficiaries) have small or even opposite effects. The strongest individual
differences we measured that predicts liking of annuities is the respondent’s perception of product
fairness. We discuss implications of our findings for financial planners hoping to help their
customers with these decumulation challenges.

THE DECUMULATION CHALLENGE
Since the rise of defined contribution (DC) plans in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
financial advisors, policy makers, and academic researchers have dedicated substantial effort into
helping Americans save more for their retirement. While these efforts have been successful at
increasing savings rates in the productive “accumulation stage” of life, less effort has been put
toward the problem of how individuals should optimally “decumulate” their assets during
retirement.
The size of the decumulation challenge is large and growing. Approximately $9.2 trillion
of retirement assets are held in DC plans or IRAs (Benartzi et al 2011). Each day, around 10,000
individuals enter retirement and face the problem of how to draw down those assets optimally
during their remaining lifetime. If the money is spent too quickly, the retiree may run out and be
destitute, but if spent too slowly, he or she may underconsume and die with unused assets. The
financial and psychological dimensions of this decumulation problem are complex involving
multiple uncertainties and value tradeoffs. First, solving the decumulation decision problem
requires an estimate of the individual’s life expectancy, a judgment that is highly uncertain and
subject to bias (Payne et al 2013). Second, individual differences in family composition, outside
income (such as Social Security), and uncertainites about future health status can all affect
income requirements during retirement. Third, there is a clear tradeoff to be made between more
retirement income sooner versus more income later. Finally, and most importantly for this paper,
psychological differences in individual-level perceived fairness, feelings of ownership, loss
aversion (not just risk aversion), as well as life expectations and patience, can strongly influence
how the individual thinks about the tradeoffs within decumulation options (Shu & Payne 2016,
Shu & Shu 2018, Shu 2018).

ANNUITIES AS A DECUMULATION TOOL
A retiree with retirement savings has several options available for generating consumable
income during retirement.1 One decumulation option is to self-manage the money (whether
done alone or with the advice of a financial planner). Here, economists’ and financial planners’
advice for optimal drawdown is to spend no more than 4% or 5% per year, to avoid running out
within thirty years (Bengen 1994). Another option, and one highly recommended by economics
experts, is to convert some portion of accumulated retirement assets into a life annuity.
A life annuity allows a retiree to exchange a lump sum for a guaranteed stream of lifetime
payments, thus effectively converting assets into an income stream more similar to a defined
benefit (pension) plan. The primary advantages of a life annuity are the implied insurance against
outliving one’s assets as well as a higher percentage annual return than is normally feasible with
self-managed accounts (for example, Brown 2007 models various assumptions and shows that a
self-managed “amoritization” strategy at market rates leads to 25% lower income in retirement
than a life annuity purchased with equivalent wealth). Thus, people who expect to live longer
should find life annuitization particularly attractive, as should individuals who are highly risk
averse and want to avoid uncertainty in future income (Poterba and Wise 1996, Milevsky 1998).
The higher return associated with a life annuity is a result of survivorship benefits, based on
pooling of assets from all contributors being used to support income to annuity holders who
continue to live. Perceived disadvantages of life annuities are that the assets are transferred to
the issuing company and therefore not available either for transfer to beneficiaries (i.e., bequests)
or for use in case of emergencies (liquidity). To address some of these disadvantages, companies
offering life annuities have introduced options such as period-certain guarantees, deferred start
dates, annual income increases to compensate for inflation, and joint annuities (e.g., for married

Decumulating private retirement savings is not the only source of income because most
Americans receive Social Security benefits. Among retirees in the bottom half of the income
distribution, Social Security benefits are in fact the majority of their retirement income (Poterba,
2014).

carries financial tradeoffs; the issue for the offering company is whether consumers are willing to
accept higher prices in exchange for these benefits.

RESEARCH ON ANNUITY CHOICE
The economics literature has long argued that annuities are the most compelling
marketplace solution to the decumulation problem (for a review, see Benartzi et al. 2011). Yaari
(1965) was one of the first to show that rational retirees with no bequest motive should use all of
their retirement assets to buy annuities. Life annuities eliminate “longevity risk”—the risk of
outliving one’s assets—while also offering a mortality premium on returns, due to the fact that
some people in the annuity pool will die early. More recently, Davidoff, Brown, and Diamond
(2005) provided a simple analysis of the attractiveness of annuitization.2 However, retirees’
purchase of annuities remains below their theoretical potential, leading to a so-called annuity
puzzle (Davidoff, Brown, and Diamond 2005; Brown 2007). A recent New York Times article
(Lieber, 1/29/2010) cites a 2009 study by Hewitt Associates reporting that just 1% of employees
actually buy annuities as payout options. Inkmann, Lopes, and Michaelides (2011), using U.K.
data, report that only about 6% of households participate in the voluntary annuity market.
Brown (2007) provides a summary of the “economic” answers to the question of why a person
might not buy some amount of a life annuity in today’s marketplace, including price premiums
due to adverse selection by individuals with longer life expectancies, but also argues that
annuities are a rational choice for many consumers.
Possible reasons for limited market demand for annuities include rational heterogeneous
preferences at the consumer level. Davidoff et al (2005), Babbel and Merrill (2006), Brown
(2007), and Benartzi et al (2011) all provide comprehensive reviews of how individual
2

They compare a one-year certificate of deposit to a security that “pays a higher interest rate at the end of the
year conditional on living, but pays nothing if you die before year-end,” and they conclude that “if you attach no
value to wealth after death, then the second, annuitized, alternative is a dominant asset” (p. 1573).

4

preferences may affect annuity demand. For example, the guaranteed monthly income provided
through Social Security could lead to less demand for additional annuitization among people
with limited retirement savings. However, this does not account for the lack of interest among
individuals higher up the wealth distribution. Similarly, an individual’s bequest motive might
account for less than full annuitization, so that some funds are set aside for beneficiaries, but
bequest motives cannot explain the pattern of nearly no annuitization even among people without
heirs. Concerns about liquidity to insure against expenditure shocks such as medical expenses
could also reduce demand for full annuitization, although demand for bundled contracts of
annuity and long-term care that can address these concerns is relatively small. Risks of inflation
might also be expected to worry consumers, but evidence from Social Security claims suggests
that many consumers have a preference for lump-sum payments rather than inflation-protected
payoffs over time that are similar to annuities. Finally, consumers may worry about default risk
by the annuity issuer, but reasonable levels of perceived default risk do not account for the
relative lack of even partial annuitization.
Thus, although rational economic explanations of the lack of annuitization are important
factors in the annuity puzzle, they do not fully explain the problem, and more psychological
factors need to be considered (Brown 2007). For instance, some studies have looked at the
general framing of the annuity decision. Hu & Scott (2007) argue that people adopt a narrow
framing of the problem as a gamble, rather than as an insurance decision, due to the complexity
of the annuity purchase task. Loss aversion from cumulative prospect theory (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1992) is also widely invoked as a reason why annuities are generally less attractive
than standard utility theory would predict, especially when considering the loss of the annuity
purchase price due to early death. The risk of losing the full value of the annuity due to an
unexpected early death is highlighted by not just loss aversion, but also the tendency to
overweight small probabilities. Brown, Kling, Mullainathan, & Wrobel (2008) offer a
preliminary test of the effects of framing the problem in terms of an investment (using words
5

such as invest and earnings) or in terms of consumption (using words such as spend and
payment) and find that consumers like economically equivalent annuities more in the
consumption frame. Agnew, Anderson, Gerlach, & Szykman, (2008) also find framing effects,
mediated by gender, in a “Retirement Game” in which subjects choose between annuities and
self-managed market investments. In our prior work, we have found that information displays
that help individuals “do the math” on the cumulative value of annuity payouts can affect both
overall interest in annuities and demand for particular annuity attributes (Shu, Zeithammer, and
Payne 2016; see also Kunreuther, Pauly, and McMorrow 2013). These behavioral explanations
of the annuity puzzle provide important insights to aspects of the annuity decision, but much
more remains to be investigated and tested.
In this paper, we go beyond testing for some of the general judgmental biases and
framing effects described above, and conduct an analysis of how measurable individual
differences among consumers affect their interest in annuities. In addition to the differences in
loss aversion described above, we consider a variety of other individual psychological
differences that could affect demand. Schreiber and Weber (2016) show that individual
differences in discount factors affect annuity choice. Other aspects of intertemporal choice, such
as differential discounting of gains and losses, predictions of resource slack, myopia and
hyperopia, construal, procrastination, and/or intertemporal consumption, may also relate to
consumers’ preference for annuities (e.g., Soman 1998, Zauberman and Lynch 2005, Shu 2008).
Consumer uncertainty exists for both judgments of future health and economic outcomes (e.g.,
inflation) and judgments of life expectancy, so capturing individual variation in life expectations
is a key input. Building on research on how trust, branding, company ratings, and perceived
fairness all affect consumer choices, we measure perceived fairness of annuities as a product
(Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1986; Seligman and Schwartz 1997, Roth 2007). Individuals’
financial knowledge and literacy, numeracy, and overall cognitive ability also offer important
predictions for how consumers who differ in individual ability may react to annuity offerings, so
6

we also include a measure of numeracy (Fernandes, Lynch, and Netemeyer 2014, Peters et al.
2006, Frederick 2005). We measure all of these psychological differences, along with a variety
of demographic and financial variables, and analyze how they correlate with individual-level
demand for annuities in a hypothetical decumulation scenario among consumers nearing
retirement.

OUR STUDIES OF CONSUMER PREFERENCES FOR ANNUITIES
To explore how consumers think about the decumulation problem, and especially how
their value differences and belief differences may drive the annuity puzzle, the rest of this paper
analyzes data regarding survey results on consumers’ preferences for annuities. The data
reported here was collected as part of a larger study measuring how consumers value particular
attributes of annuities relative to their actuarial value; those results suggested that individual
differences were also important to annuity choice (Shu, Zeithammer, and Payne 2016). While
our previous work focused on the value of the individual annuity attributes among consumers
who say they would purchase at least some of the annuities our survey offered, this paper
contrasts consumers who are willing to consider at least some types of annuities to those who
avoid them entirely in our surveys.

Study Implementation: subject recruitment and detailed survey procedure
We completed two separate studies, with different participants per study, to explore the
question of who chooses annuities. Study 1 focuses only on how a wide variety of demographics
and psychographics affects annuity choice; we also include measures to capture differences in
bequest motives, family status, risk aversion, and understanding of annuities. In Study 2, we
include a test of an intervention that provides respondents with calculations for the cumulative
value of each annuity, in the hopes of increasing overall demand for annuities (as recommended
in Kunreuther, Pauly, and McMorrow 2013). Both studies were constructed as choice-based
7

conjoint analyses (Lenk et al 1996), in which study participants make a series of twenty choices,
with each choice including three described annuities and an outside choice of self-management.
Because the studies are similar in design we report them side by side in the remainder of the
paper.
Participants. We recruited participants through a commercial online panel from
Qualtrics. Qualtrics does hundreds of academic research projects and also serves clients such as
the US Army and government agencies. Panel members opt-in to Qualtrics through various
websites and are offered the opportunity to participate in surveys; Qualtrics does not actively
solicit for its panel. For both studies, participation was limited to individuals between the ages of
40 and 65 because this target group is the most appropriate for annuity purchases. We placed no
limit on household income or current retirement savings, but we collected data on these
characteristics so that we could perform an analysis of how financial status affects preferences.
We also included several demographic questions including age, gender, race, and marital status.
To assess financial literacy, we included eight numeracy and cognitive reflection (CRT)
questions. Finally, we also collected key individual difference measures suggested in the
literature to affect liking for annuities, including bequest motives, life expectations, loss
aversion, risk aversion, and annuity perceptions such as attitude, desire for control, and perceived
fairness.
To reduce the number of respondents who either do not understand the instructions or do
not pay attention to the task, we included an attention filter at the start of the survey and
excluded participants who did not pass the filter. For Study 1, our final sample consists of 404
respondents. Of the 404, we have eliminated 41 who took less than 15 minutes to complete the
questionnaire—a time we consider unreasonably fast. This elimination results in 363 useable
respondents. Study 2 included two conditions: with and without an “enriched” information
display of cumulative payouts per annuity. This sample consists of 334 respondents in the basic
treatment (no display) and 323 in the enriched information treatment. Table 1 summarizes the
8

respondent demographic and psychographic characteristics. Although ours is clearly a
convenience sample of respondents, many of the demographic measures such as household
income, race, and gender align well with general population distributions, suggesting our sample
is reasonably representative of American households.
Procedure. In both studies, participants began by reading short descriptions of the
annuity attributes being tested in the conjoint analysis as well as the full range of levels for each
of these attributes (see Shu, Zeithammer, and Payne 2016 for more detail on annuity attributes).
They were told the annuities were otherwise identical and satisfactory on all omitted
characteristics. They were also told all annuities were based on an initial purchase price of
$100,000 at age 65. We then asked each participant to complete 20 choice tasks. To control for
order effects, we presented the choice tasks to the participants in a random order.
In each choice task, participants were asked, “If you were 65 and considering putting
$100,000 of your retirement savings into an annuity, which of the following would you choose?”
They then saw three annuity options and a fourth option that read, “None: If these were my only
options, I would defer my choice and continue to self-manage my retirement assets.” Figure 1
provides a sample choice task used in both studies, including the enriched information treatment
from one of the conditions in Study 2.
After completing all 20 choice tasks in their assigned condition, participants were asked
to fill out a number of additional demographic and psychographic measures. First we asked them
how long they expected to rely on their retirement funds, by having them indicate the probability
that they would live to ages 65, 75, 85, and 95 (Payne et al. 2013).3 We next collected
demographic information including gender, race, marital status, number of children, household
income, and retirement assets. To assess financial literacy, we included five numeracy questions
and three CRT questions (Weller et al. 2012, Frederick 2005). In Study 1, we administered an
3

Payne et al (2013) found that wording probabilistic life expectations questions in either a “live to” or “die by”
frame changed average estimate life expectations by approximately ten years. Because “live to” framing has been
found to have better predictive power for retirement decisions, we recommend and use it here.

9

additional set of questions to measure individual differences in key constructs thought to affect
preference for annuities. We collected bequest motives by asking individuals who they would
identify as beneficiaries, whether they had formally or informally designated any portion of their
savings as inheritance to others, and if so, what proportion of their savings was so designated.
We also asked them to agree or disagree (7-point Likert scale) with statements about the
importance of providing inheritance for family members versus financing their own retirement
(see Appendix for text of all questions).
Research has suggested perceived fairness is an important consideration for consumers of
financial products as well as a strong input into attitude measures for such products; such
fairness judgments depend on not just how outcomes are shared between consumers and firms,
but also on the transparency and procedural aspects of the system that determines the outcomes
(Bies et al. 1993). Therefore, in both studies we measured perceived fairness for annuities
through both direct questions about fairness (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1986) and
questions about the process underlying annuities; the inter-item covariance for these factors is
high (α = .91) and factor analysis suggests the factor driven by the single-item direct fairness
question captures 78% of the overall variance. Thus, for the remainder of this analysis, we use
the single-item direct fairness measure as our measure of perceived fairness for annuities.
Specifically, the direct fairness measure asks “Please rate how fair you think a life annuity
product is?” on a 4-point scale {Very Unfair, Somewhat Unfair, Acceptable, Completely Fair}.
We measured risk aversion in Study 1 through a series of choices for uncertain annuity income
streams adapted from Barsky et al. (1997) as used in the 1992 HRS; responses to these choices
allow us to categorize individuals into one of six levels of risk aversion (also see Kapteyn and
Teppa 2011). Finally, participants in both studies responded to a set of 10 questions that asked
them to choose between mixed (gain and loss) gambles, thus providing us with individual-level
loss-aversion measures (Brooks and Zank 2005, Payne, Shu, Webb, and Sagara 2015).

10

Model Estimation Methodology: two types of respondents
Although our conjoint task involved 20 single-stage choices between four options (three
annuities and one outside (self-managed) option), we find that a substantial proportion of
respondents do not like annuities at all. Specifically, of the 363 participants in Study 1, 22%
(n=80) did not choose any annuity at all among the 20 choice tasks they completed (in other
words, they chose the outside “self-manage” option 20 times). We find consistent results in
Study 2, where 20% of the 334 participants in the basic-information condition and 16% of the
323 participants in the enriched-information condition choose no annuities among all tasks.
Some of the annuities in our design provided well over $200K in expected NPV payout, in
exchange for the $100K price of the annuity (held constant throughout). Therefore, we conclude
some people simply dislike the idea of an annuity a priori, and are unwilling to consider these
products even with a suggested substantial economic benefit.
As an example of this disliking of high-actuarial-value annuities, consider the three
options displayed in the sample task shown in Figure 1. Taking into account standard mortality
rates and an annual discount factor of 0.97, the actuarial value for each annuity is $264,900 for
Option A, $174,100 for Option B, and $165,700 for Option C. In Study 1, 41% of respondents
selected “none of the above” in this example choice task. In Study 2, 36% of respondents in the
basic information condition and 24% of respondents in the enriched information condition
selected “none of the above.” This strong aversion to annuities with a high actuarial benefit
relative to upfront costs (more than would ever be offered in the market, in fact) suggests some
individuals are unwilling to consider annuities regardless of the benefit offered. In the next
section, we focus on describing these “annuity haters”.
Estimation results: Willingness to consider annuities
In this section, we describe how the 283 subjects who chose at least one annuity in Study
1 differ from the 80 “annuity haters.” Table 2 shows the univariate analysis, which compares

11

annuity haters to the rest of the sample using each variable separately. Measured variables are
standardized by rescaling them to a value between 0 and 1, except for life expectations which are
left in years. The only variable which exhibits a significant difference in both studies is fairness:
in terms of the underlying 4-point fairness scale, annuity haters consider annuities to be
“Somewhat unfair”, while the rest of the respondents consider them to be closer to “Acceptable”.
Study 1 also suggests that annuity-haters are more likely to be female, over 60, more risk-averse,
and, perhaps surprisingly, wealthy as measured by retirement savings over $150,000. Study 2
also measured gender, age, and retirement savings, but these significant demographic findings of
Study 1 did not replicate (recall that only the basic information condition of Study 2 is relevant
as a replication of Study 1). Conversely, Study 2 found a significant difference in numeracy, but
Study 1 did not.
We now move from the univariate analysis shown in Table 2 to a logistic regression
multivariate analysis. This approach allows the model to take all variables into account
simultaneously, and hence control for confounds. In other words, the logistic regression shows
the marginal effect of each variable while holding all other variables constant. Table 3 shows
results for the three logistic regressions of selecting at least one annuity on individual
characteristics versus disliking annuities a priori (the annuity haters) for Study 1 and the two
conditions of Study 2. In both studies, most demographics are not significant correlates of buying
annuities. In both studies, the exceptions echo the results of the univariate analysis in that
choosing at least one annuity is associated with having lower retirement savings and lower riskaversion in Study 1, and with being more numerate in Study 2. It seems that age and gender –
found to be significant predictors by the univariate analysis in Study 1 but not by the multivariate
analysis of the same data – are merely correlated with other significant explanatory variables.
Interestingly, the multivariate analysis of Study 1 suggests an inverse-U-shape effect of
retirement savings4, with a significant negative coefficient on individuals with over $150K
4

Theory suggests that retirees with about $100K are the best candidates fora $100K annuity

12

saved. Unfortunately, this pattern does not replicate in Study 2 even directionally. The
multivariate analysis also finds that survey respondents in Study 1 who clearly identify a family
member as a potential beneficiary are significantly more likely to select annuities, a somewhat
surprising result given theoretical predictions that individuals with family beneficiaries may like
annuities less due to bequest motives or use of the family as a replacement for an annuity (Brown
2007, Kotlikoff and Spivak 1981). This intriguing result could suggest instead that individuals
who are worried about becoming a burden on family are more open to the idea of annuities; more
research is needed to better understand the tradeoff between bequests and dependence.
As in the univariate analysis, there is only one individual difference that has a large effect
and replicates across both studies: perceived fairness of annuities (measured by a direct question
on a 4-point scale following Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1986, see above for details):
individuals who perceive annuities to be fair are much more likely to select some in our studies.
The coefficients on fairness are much larger than the coefficients on all other measures, which is
meaningful given that the measures have all been standardized to be between 0 and 1. To get a
sense of the effect’s magnitude, imagine an average respondent in Study 1, who considers
annuities to be about half way between “Somewhat Unfair” and “Acceptable”, and has a
probability of 0.16 of being an annuity-hater according to the estimated logistic regression.
Keeping all variables at their average level while changing the fairness perception to
“Completely fair” reduces the person’s probability of being an annuity hater to 0.03. Conversely,
changing to “Very Unfair” increases the probability of being an annuity hater to 0.56. We also
included several other psychological measures in our logistic regression that we expected to
influence overall liking of annuities, such as risk aversion, loss aversion, numeracy, and life
expectancy. None of these measures had a significant effect on willingness to consider annuities,
with the exception of a negative effect of very high levels of risk aversion in Study 1 and a
positive effect of numeracy in the basic-information condition of Study 2. It is worth noting that
the negative effect of risk aversion is contrary to normative economic theory, which predicts that
13

higher risk aversion should lead to stronger preference for guaranteed life income because an
annuity is fundamentally an insurance product.
In addition to evaluating the individual characteristics of which individuals do and do not
like annuities in our studies, the results reported in Table 3 also allow us to observe the effect of
providing the “enriched” cumulative payout table in the second condition of Study 2. Recall
from Figure 1 that the enriched condition “did the math” for participants by multiplying out the
monthly payouts (including any annual increases) by number of years to calculate the cumulative
payout for various survival ages. In our previous work (Shu, Zeithammer, and Payne 2016), we
found that this enriched information table made participants value particular annuity attributes,
such as annual increases, at levels more similar to their full actuarial value. It also increased
overall liking of annuities. We also observe that latter result in the data analysis reported here; by
comparing the constant estimated for condition 1 of Study 2 ( -2.59) to that of condition 2 (1.29),
we can see a significant drop in the overall percentage of individuals who never choose any
annuity at all across our twenty tasks. Put into percentage terms, 20% of participants in condition
1 never chose an annuity (similar to the 22% in Study 1), but this percentage dropped
significantly to only 16% of participants in condition 2. These results suggest that providing the
enriched table helped our study respondents recognize the overall value of these annuities over
time.

DISCUSSION
While the studies reported here are relatively simple in design, they still yield some
interesting and novel insights about the types of individuals who do and do not like annuities.
Looking overall at the percentage of individuals who never selected any of the highly valuable
annuities across our twenty study tasks, a relatively high percentage (approximately 20%) dislike
annuities strongly enough to never select one. Encouragingly, this percentage drops to 16% when
an enriched information display is provided that helps individuals recognize the value of the
14

annuities over time. Such a display offers hope to marketers and planners who hope to encourage
purchase of annuities that simple changes in how information is provided can be powerful as
interventions to increase perceived value.
More novel are the findings about which individual differences are significant predictors
of who likes and dislikes annuities. Standard demographic characteristics, such as gender, age,
marital status, and income are all insignificant in our data. Characteristics predicted to be
important based on traditional economic models, such as health, life expectations, saved assets,
and numeracy, are either insignificant or small in their effect. Some measures predicted by
traditional models to be important that are significant are actually opposite in the predicted
effect, such as risk aversion and well-identified family beneficiaries. We also used this
opportunity to test psychological measures such as loss aversion that more recent behavioral
models have predicted as important for annuities. Interestingly, the coefficient on high loss
aversion is consistently negative across all studies, but not significant, consistent with our
prediction that high loss aversion (unlike risk aversion) can help explain dislike of annuities.5
However, by far the strongest of all the individual differences we measured at predicting
liking of annuities is the question of whether the individuals think annuities are “fair”. Prior
research on consumer fairness has suggested that judgments of fairness are affected by the way
that profits are shared between the firm and consumer (Kahnaman, Knetsch and Thaler 1986),
the intentions of the firm (Campbell 1999), the firm’s perceived wealth and power (Seligman,
Schwartz 1997), and whether underlying costs are variable or fixed (Nunes, Hsee, Weber 2004).
In this project, our fairness measure was a simple one taken directly from Kahneman, Knetsch,
and Thaler (1986). It is difficult using only this measure to determine what our participants had
in mind when they answered the question, or what outside influences might affect these fairness
judgments. For example, it is possible that exposure to negative media coverage of other types of
5

Additional research by Shu & Payne (2013) finds that high levels of individual loss aversion are a strong and
significant predictor of which individuals intend to claim their Social Security retirement benefits early, consistent
with this predicted effect on annuities.

15

annuity products (e.g., variable annuities instead of life annuities) could affect perceptions, as
could access (or lack of access) to financial planners who understand the value of the product.
More research is necessary to understand the drivers of these fairness perceptions. From a
positive perspective for marketers of these products, however, this suggests that the annuity
puzzle is more a problem of perception that of the financial tradeoffs inherent in the product.
Our findings offer several practical implications for financial planners who are working
with clients to design optimal decumulation plans for retirement. While economists have argued
for the important role of life annuities in retirement, especially as a tool to manage longevity risk
and uncertainty, demand by consumers has been limited. Our research identifies which clients
may be most open to the possibility of annuities – specifically, individuals who are less loss
averse and consider annuities more fair will be more willing to consider annuity options.
Ongoing research suggests that these individual differences are more important in decumulation
decisions than in the accumulation stage (Shu & Payne 2013, Shu & Shu 2018); while most
workers agree on the need to save for the future and respond well to standard savings
interventions, the decumulation process requires greater personalization to the needs and
preferences of the client. As legislators consider making annuities a more available option in
workers’ 401(k) plans (Rubin and Tergesen 2018), helping individuals make wise choices about
incorporating annuities into their retirement plans will be an increasingly important task.
