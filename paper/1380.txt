Money, The Rate of Devaluation and
Interest Rates in a Semi—Open Economy:
Colombia 1968—1982

ABSTRACT

In this paper an empirical model for analyzing the behavior of nominal

interest rates in a semi—open economy is developed. The model explicitly
incorporates both the role of open economy factors (i.e., world interest
rates, expected rate of devaluation) and domestic monetary conditions in

explaining interest rates movement. The model is tested using quarterly data
for Colombia for 1968—1982. The results obtained indicate that the semi—open
characterization is adequate for the case of Colombia, and that world interest

rates, the rate of devaluation and domestic monetary conditions have affected

domestic nominal interest rates during the period under consideration. The
results also indicate that unanticipated increases in the nominal quantity of
money have exercised a negative effect on nominal interest rates in Colombia.

I. Introduction
Most empirical studies on interest rates behavior have made extreme
assumptions regarding the degree of openness of the economy under considera-

tion. Generally, it has been assumed that the economy in question is either
completely closed to the rest of the world, or that it is fully open, and that

there are no controls to capital movements. In reality, however, most cases

—

and especially those of developing countries —— correspond to an inter-

mediate situation, where the capital account of the balance of payments is

partially open, and there exist some controls to capital movements. Under
these circumstances it would be expected that in the short—run the domestic
rate of interest will respond both to external factors (i.e.., world interest

rates) and to internal monetary conditions, (i.e., excess supply or demand for

money). The purpose of this paper is to develop an empirical model to analyze
the behavior of nominal interest rates in a small semi—open economy. The
model specifically considers the role of open economy factors —

world

rate of

interest and expected rate of devaluation, for example —, and the role of
more traditional domestic monetary conditions in explaining interest rates
behavior.

The model is tested using quarterly data for Colombia for 1968—1982.
Colombia is a semi—open economy, with a growing domestic capital market

partially integrated to the international financial markets. In that sense,
then, the behavior of the interest rate in Colombia cannot be explained by
conventional models that assume a fully open or completely closed economy.'
The analysis presented in this paper is useful for evaluating two key
policy issues that are of great importance in semi—open developing economies.
First, the model directly addresses the question of the relationship between

the rate of devaluation and the nominal interest rate. The importance of this

2

question stems from the fact that many times the monetary authorities in semi—
open developing countries are reluctant to adjust the exchange rate because of
the possible effects that this measure will have on domestic interest rates.
Second, the model will be useful to determine the effects of changes in
monetary policy ——

both anticipated and unanticipated — on domestic interest

rates. The empirical analysis of the relation between the rate of devaluation
and the domestic interest rate is particularly important in the Colombian
case, where a crawling peg exchange rate system has been in effect since

1967.2 Recently, however, a number of observers have pointed out that the
real

exchange rate is overvalued and have recommended to accelerate the rate

of devaluation of the Colombian crawling peg. [See, for example, Fedesarrollo
(1983),

Ocampo (1983).] The analysis presented in this paper, then, will be

useful to determine the effect of a faster rate of crawling on the domestic
nominal interest rate.

The paper is organized in the following form: Section II presents an
empirical framework for analyzing the determination of nominal interest rates

in a small semi—open economy. In Section III empirical results obtained from
estimating the model using quarterly data for 1968 through 1982 for Colombia

are presented, In Section IV the analysis of the role of monetary factors in
determining the behavior of the interest rate In Colombia is taken one step

further. In this section the role of actual vs. unanticipated changes in
nominal money is investigated. This section also includes a brief discussion
on the role of expected inflation in the semi—open economy framework used in

this paper. Finally, in Section V some concluding remarks are presented.

3

II. Money, the Rate of Devaluation, and Interest Rates in a Semi—Open Economy
In a fully open economy, where economic agents are risk neutral and

foreign

and domestic bonds are perfect substitutes, the internal and external

interest rates are linked through the interest parity condition (1) (this
ignores taxation, see Levi 1977):
=

jW De

(1)

where

= domestic nominal interest rate
i foreign (world) nominal interest rate, on instruments that have the
same maturity as the domestic papers

D =

expected rate of devaluation of the domestic currency between
period t and the period corresponding to the maturity of the

financial instruments. The subscript t refers to the fact that

this expectation is formed in period t. Then, if dt is the
actual rate of devaluation in period t, and the maturity of the

financial instruments is one period, D =

E(d+1),

where E is

the expectations operator.
If in the economy in question there are no impediments to capital movements,

equation (1) will tend to hold both in the short— and in the long—run. The
empirical evidence available suggests that a revised version of equation (1)

—

which replaces De by the forward premium, incorporates transaction costs,

and considers off—shore interest rates —

holds closely for the case of

industrialized countries [see Frenkel and Levich, 1975 and 19771.
In the case of semi—open economies expression (1), however, clearly does

not hold. Quite on the contrary, the recent experience of the countries of
the cone of South—America (Argenina, Chile, Uruguay) suggests that in semi—
industrialized, semi—open economies the divergences from (1) can be

4

substantial, The case of Colombia also shows important deviations from
equation (1) [see Blejer and Landau (1984), and Montes and Candelo
(1982)].

Equation (1) can be modified in several ways in order to incorporate the

fact that we are dealing with a semi—open economy. In particular, it is
possible to write an expression that indicates that the domestic interest rate
tends to equate the world rate of interest plus the rate of devaluation and a

risk premium in the long—run, but that it can differ from it in the short—

run. If we denote the risk premium in period t by '

equation

(1) can

then be replaced by the following expression:
=

e[(i+D+)

—

it_li

(2)

where 0<0<1.
Even though equation (2) captures an important characteristic of a semi—

open economy — the fact that it takes time for the interest parity condition
to hold —,

it

does not allow for domestic monetary conditions to play any

role in the behavior of the domestic interest rate. In a semi—open economy,
however, where capital movements are subject to a number of controls, it is
conceivable that domestic monetary policy will have some effect on the short—

run behavior of the interest rate, The possible role of the conditions
prevailing in the domestic money market on interest rate behavior in a semi—
open economy can be captured by the following expression:
=

where 't

is

0[(i+D+) — 1tlI

— X[log in1 —
log

m]

(3)

the real quantity of money in t, and where m is the

quantity of money demanded in that period. This equation differs from equation (2) in that it explicitly allows for internal monetary disequilibria to

5

affect interest rates movements. The parameter A measures the importance of
these disequilibria, and the negative sign reflects the hypothesis that an
excess supply (demand) for real money will generate a decline (increase) in

the nominal interest rate. An important property of (3) is that the extreme
situations of fully open or completely closed economies are particular cases

of this expression. If the economy under study is fully open to the rest of

the world, we would expect that e =

1.0 and A = 0.

If, on the other hand,

the economy is completely closed to foreign influences it would be expected

that 0

0 and A > 0. In the case of a semi—open economy, however, it

would be expected that both 0 and A would be significantly different from
zero.

III. Empirical Results
In this section results obtained from the estimation of a reduced form of
equation (3) using quarterly data for 1968—1982 for Colombia are presented.3
In the estimation it is assumed that the expected rate of devaluation of the

Colombian peso in period t+l, as formed in period t (Dr), is equal to the
actual rate Qf devaluation in period t (dt). This corresponds to the
(plausible) assumption that during 1968—1982 the rate of devaluation in

Colombia can be represented by a random walk with a zero drift term. In fact,
the time series analysis of the rate of devaluation for this period suggests
that the random walk with zero drift hypothesis cannot be rejected.4

With respect to the risk premium ($)

it

is assumed, in order to

simplify the analysis, that it can be represented by a constant k plus a
normally distributed random term

(

with zero mean and variance

Regarding the demand fr money function, it is assumed that

it has a conventional form:

6

log m = b + b1 log y — b2

for y = real

income.

Combining equations (3) and (4) and using the assumption for the risk

premium

the following reduced form is obtained:6

where

yi(i+d)

is an error term, and it is expected that

(5)

> 0, 13 < 0

> 0,

and 14 > 0. The expressions for the y's in terms of the parameters of the
=

structural equations (3) and (4) are:
13 —

XI(l+Ab2);

14 =

e/(l+xb2);

12 =

(l—e)/(l+xb2);

Ab1/(l+Ab2).

Equation (5) was estimated using OLS and instrumental variables
methods. The reason for using instrumental variables is that

y might not

be exogenous in a small semi—open economy like Colombia. Table 1 contains the
results obtained from the estimation of the reduced form equation (5).

The values of Durbin's h reported in Table 1 indicate that the errors
might be negatively correlated. For this reason procedures that correct for
serially correlated disturbances were also used. For example, equation (5)
was also estimated using the two—stages procedure suggested by Fair (1970) to
deal with serial correlation in the presence of a lagged dependent variable.
The results obtained show that the estimated first—order correlation

coefficient (p) is very small, and that the estimated coefficients reported
in Table 1 are not significantly affected:

Table 2 presents the estimated structural coefficients computed from

equations (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3). One of the most important results reported

in these tables refer to the estimated values of 0. This coefficient, which
in all the estimations was statistically significant, measures the speed at

which uncovered interest rate differentials will be corrected. As can be
seen,

0 is fairly high, indIcating that, with other things given, In one

quarter almost one—half of a unitary discrepancy between (i+d) and

1t—1

will be corrected. This coefficient suggests, for example, that higher world
interest rates will be quickly translated into higher Interest rates in

Colombia. This seems to have been the case in Colombia during the early
1980's where the higher world interest rates were rapidly reflected
domestically.

The results obtained can also be used to simulate the effect of an
increase of the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg on the nominal

interest rate. This is an important policy question that usually arises in
discussions concerning "unwanted" effects of accelerating the rate of

devaluation. Consider, for example, the case of equation (5.1), and assume

that in period 0 the domestic nominal interest rate is 40% and that the rate
of devaluation of the crawling peg is 22% per annum. Assume now that in
period 1 the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg is increased to 32%, and

maintained at this higher level. In the case where all other variables remain
constant, the evolution of the domestic interest rate, using the estimated

parameters from equation (5.1), is given in Table 3. As may be seen, these
results show a fairly fast speed of adjustment of the domestic interest rate

to the higher rate of devaluation of the crawling peg. After one year 6.1
percentage points of the devaluation have already been reflected in the

domestic

interest rate.7

8

The results reported in equations (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) also provide
information regarding the role of monetary conditions on interest rate

behavior. These estimates provide semi--elasticities, of the interest rates

with respect to real money ranging from —0.171 to —0.254. In the next section
the role of actual vs. unanticipated changes in nominal money on interest rate

behavior in Colombia is explicitly investigated.8
The estimated equations also provide plausible estimates for the

parameters in the demand for money equation in Colombia. As may be seen from
Table 2, the estimated long—run income elasticity of the demand for money in

Colombia ranges from 1.6 to 1.9. The semi—elasticity of the demand for money
relative to the nominal interest rate, on the other hand, ranges from —0.954

to —1.231. These numbers roughly correspond to what has been previously
estimated for Colombia [see, Montes and Candelo, 1982].

IV. Unanticipated Money and Interest Rates in Colombia
The analysis presented in the previous section uses actual real money to
investigate the relationship between monetary conditions and nominal interest

rates in Colombia. Most of the recent work in macroeconomics, however, has
emphasized the importance of unexpected monetary shocks as opposed to actual

changes in money.9 In this section the role of unanticipated and actual
changes in the nominal quantity of money in explaining the behavior of nominal

interest rates in Colombia is investigated. This is done in the following

way: First, in equation (5) log mt_i is replaced by a measure of unexpected

nominal money shocks (DMR). And second, in equation (5) log m_1 is also
replaced by the actual rate of growth of nominal money (DMN).
The series for unexpected changes n the nominal quantity of money were
constructedas the residuals from the estimation of an autoregressive process

9

of order 7 for changes in the nominal quantity of money. After running this
AR process the corresponding residuals were checked to make sure that they
were white noise.1° The results obtained from the estimation of the interest
rate equations that include unanticipated and actual nominal monetary shocks
are presented in Table 4.

As may

be

seen the coefficients of Dt'IRt are significantly negative as

expected. Also, as expected, the coefficient of the actual rate of change of
nominal money (DMNt) are non—significantly different from zero. Generally
speaking, these results show that while unanticipated changes in the nominal
quantity of money have exercised a negative effect on nominal interest rates
in Colombia, actual changes in nominal money (with other things equal) have

tended to leave interest rates unaffected. Inother important result from

Table 4 is that the estimated coefficients of (i + d) are not affected by
the inclusion of DMRt. This provides further support to the hypothesis that
models of a semi—open economy are appropriate for explaining interest rate
behavior in Colombia.
Up to now there has been no mention of the possible role of expected

inflation in determining interest rate behavior in Colombia. The reason for
this is that in the semi—open economy framework of this paper the traditional

role of expected inflation is captured by expected devaluation D. As long
as there is a close relationship between the rate of devaluation and inflation, as it has been the case in Colombia, the expected rate of devaluation

will reflect the expectations of inflation.'1 However, in order to test for a
possible independent role for the expected rate of inflation, the equations
reported in Tables 1 and 4 were also estimated adding a proxy for expected

inflation as a possible additional expl;natory variables. However, in the
results obtained the coefficient for the expected rate of inflation were in

10

all cases very small and insignificant.

V. Concluding Remarks
In this paper an empirical model for analyzing interest rates behavior in

a semi—open economy was presented. The model was tested for the case of
Colombia using quarterly data for 1968—1982. The results obtained were

remarkably good, and indicated that: (a) differentials between domestic
nominal interest rates and world interest rates plus expected devaluation and

risk premiums will tend to be corrected quite fast. (b) In one year an
acceleration of the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg, will be trans-

lated in about 60% into a higher domestic rate of interest. (c) An excess
supply for real money will exercise significant negative pressures on the

nominal interest rate (i.e., there is a liquidity effect). (d) Unanticipated
changes in the nominal quantity of money will also exercise a negative presure

on nominal interest rates. On the other hand actual increases in the rate of
growth of nominal money will leave the rate of interest unaffected.

5From a theoretical perspective the risk premium

will depend on

variables like the stocks of outside government assets. Empirical studies on
the subject, however, have generally failed to find this kind of relationship

(see, for example, Frankel 1982). For this reason in this paper a more simple
approach has been taken with respect to the representation of

6 important property of equation (3) is that even in the long—run the
domestic rate of interest will not be necessarily equal to the world interest

rate plus the rate of devaluation. In fact, according to (3) and the assump-

tions regarding D and ,

in

the long—run the domestic interest rate will

be equal to:

=

(i + d) + [k + + w1.

alternative exercise that can

be performed is to simulate the effect

of a higher rate of devaluation of the crawling peg under the assumption that

[log m_1 —

log m] remains constant. In this case, of course, the

adjustment of the domestic interest rate is much faster. For example, for the
numbers used in the exercise reported in Table 3, after one year the domestic
nominal interest rate will be equal to 49.2Z.

8 important characteristic of equation (3) is that it implies that in

the long—run, for given i and d, changes in the real quantity of money
will not affect i. Since this is a fairly strong implication, regressions
that incorporated up to 12 lags of log in were also run. The results obtained show that only the contemporaneous and once lagged coefficients are

signifIcantly negative. Starting with log mt_2 the coefficients become
positive. The sum of the 12 coefficients is not significantly different from
zero (—0.171 with a standard error of 0.474.) It should be noticed, however,

that in a more complete model that allo's for a variable risk premium (),
changes in the real quantity of money could affect i in the long—run,

time the empirical analysis of the determinants of the exchange rate risk

those cases the coefficients of DMRt were also significantly negative.
