    "abstract": "\n\nWould workers apply to better firms if they were more informed about firm quality? Collaborating with 26 science-based startups, we create a custom job board and invite business school alumni to apply. The job board randomizes across applicants to show coarse expert ratings of all startups\u2019 science and/or business model quality. Making ratings visible strongly reallocates applications toward higher-rated firms. This reallocation holds restricting to high-quality workers. Treatments operate in part by shifting worker beliefs about firms\u2019 right-tail outcomes. Despite these benefits, workers make post-treatment bets indicating highly overoptimistic beliefs about startup success, suggesting a problem of broader informational deficits.\n\n",
