    "abstract": "\n\nI review the contribution and influence of Milton Friedman\u2019s 1968 presidential address to the American Economic Association. I argue that Friedman\u2019s influence on the practice of central banking was profound and that his argument in favour of monetary rules was responsible for thirty years of low and stable inflation in the period from 1979 through 2009. I present a critique of Friedman\u2019s position that market-economies are self-stabilizing, and I describe an alternative reconciliation of Keynesian economics with Walrasian general equilibrium theory from that which is widely accepted today by most neo-classical economists.\n\n",
