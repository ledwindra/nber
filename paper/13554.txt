ABSTRACT
This paper measures the direct and indirect incidence of a carbon tax using current income and two
measures of lifetime income to rank households. Our results suggest that carbon taxes are more regressive
when annual income is used as a measure of economic welfare than when proxies for lifetime income
are used.
Further, the direct component of the tax, in any given year, is significantly more regressive than the
indirect component. In fact, for 1987, the indirect component of the tax is mildly progressive. We
observe a modest shift over time with the direct component of carbon taxes becoming less regressive
and the indirect component becoming more regressive. These effects mostly offset each other and
the distribution of the total tax burden has not changed much over time.
In addition we find that regional variation has fluctuated over the years of our anlaysis. By 2003 there
is little systematic variation in carbon tax burdens across regions of the country.

1. Introduction
Economists have long argued that market based instruments are more efficient
than regulations as a means of addressing the social damages arising from polluting
activities. By market-based instruments we mean policies that force firms to
“internalize” the cost of polluting activities. In the context of climate change arising
from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the polluting activity is the release of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases.1 Carbon taxes and cap and trade systems are two
examples of market based instruments that create a cost to emissions. A carbon tax does
this directly by taxing the carbon content of fuels while a cap and trade system imposes a
cost by requiring the surrender of valuable permits in proportion to the carbon content of
fossil fuels.2
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions equaled 7,147 million metric tons of CO2
equivalent (MMCO2e) in 2005, an increase of 17 percent over 1990 levels. Carbon
dioxide emissions account for the vast bulk of emissions and equaled 6008.6 MMCO2 in
that year. A consensus is emerging in the United States that climate change is a critical
issue requiring a reduction in GHG emissions. Several bills have been proposed in the
current Congressional legislative session to control greenhouse gas emissions.3 And at
the end of May, President Bush called for the United States along with other major
greenhouse gas emitting countries to "set a long-term goal for reducing greenhouse
gases" (Stolberg (2007)). The recent releases of reports by Intergovernmental Panel on
1

The major greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and various fluorocarbons
and other gases.
2
While this analysis focuses on energy-related carbon emissions only, a carbon tax or cap and trade
system can incorporate all greenhouse gases, typically by using the 100 year global warming potential
coefficient for the various gases to convert to a CO2 equivalent.
3
Paltsev et al. (2007) describe and conduct an economic analysis of climate mitigation scenarios based on
these proposals.

Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report's Working Groups provide additional
evidence to support the role of anthropogenic warming. Working Group I describes the
build-up of greenhouse gas concentrations and the role of human activity clearly:
Global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous
oxide have increased markedly as a result of human activities since 1750
and now far exceed pre-industrial values determined from ice cores
spanning many thousands of years. The global increases in carbon dioxide
concentration are due primarily to fossil fuel use and land use change,
while those of methane and nitrous oxide are primarily due to agriculture.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007), p. 2

A major concern with either a carbon tax or a cap and trade program to reduce
emissions is that the burden of the costs arising from the policy will fall
disproportionately on poorer households – or in the terminology of incidence analysis,
the policies will be regressive.4 Metcalf (1999, 2007) argues that even if a carbon tax is
regressive, a carbon tax reform (combining a carbon tax with a revenue neutral reduction
in some other tax) can be distributionally neutral or even progressive if desired.
In this paper, we focus on a related but different point. We measure to what
extent a carbon tax is regressive in a lifetime income framework.5 We also decompose
the burden of the tax into direct and indirect components. The direct component
measures household burdens from their direct consumption of fuels (gasoline, home
heating, and electricity) while the indirect component measures the increase in the cost of
other goods resulting from the higher fuel costs used in their production. We look at

4

The costs of a regressive policy as a share of income fall as income rises. The opposite holds for a
progressive policy. We are focusing only on the higher costs of fossil fuels arising from the policies. We
do not focus on the use of the funds from a carbon tax or from auctioning permits in this paper.
5
Without loss of generality we will frame the policy as a carbon tax. The analysis is identical for a cap
and trade program where the permits are auctioned.

three different years, 1987, 1997, and 2003 to see how the incidence pattern would
change had a carbon tax been in effect in these three time periods.
Our results suggest that in general, carbon taxes appear to be more regressive
when income is used as a measure of economic welfare than when consumption (current
or lifetime) is used to measure incidence. Further, the direct component of the tax, in any
given year, is more regressive than the indirect component. In fact, for 1987, the indirect
component of the tax is actually mildly progressive, as the higher income groups tend to
pay a larger fraction of their “income” in carbon taxes.
Studying the intertemporal distribution, we find that between 1987 and 2003,
direct taxes have become marginally less regressive, while indirect taxes have become
marginally more regressive. As a result, the distribution of the total tax burden has not
changed much over time.
Carbon taxes are also thought to have uneven regional effects. We report the
average carbon tax paid per household across regions and find that the regional variation
is at best modest. By 2003 variation across regions is sufficiently small that one could
argue that a carbon tax is distributionally neutral across regions. Not surprisingly much
of the variation that we do observe arises from the direct carbon tax rather than the
indirect tax. In other words, differences in driving patterns and weather conditions drive
the variation rather than the choice of energy intensive commodities in different regions.
In the next section, we explore different methods used to measure incidence and
motivate the lifetime measure of consumption employed in Bull et al.(1994). Section III
details our data and methodology. Section IV presents results for the economic incidence
of the tax. Section V explores the geographic incidence of the tax. Section VI concludes.

II. Measurement of Incidence
Tax incidence measures the ultimate impact of a tax on the welfare of members of
society. The economic incidence of a tax may differ markedly from the statutory
incidence due to price changes. For a carbon tax, the short run economic incidence is
likely to differ markedly from the economic incidence. While the statutory incidence of
an upstream tax on gasoline may be on the refinery owner, the economic incidence is
likely to be on final consumers as the tax is shifted forward to consumers in the form of
higher prices. Measuring the incidence of a tax requires numerous assumptions and we
begin the analysis by setting out our assumptions and methodology.
First, we must determine the appropriate unit of observation, which could be an
individual or a household. For this study, we use the household as a unit. Second, we
must choose the appropriate time frame of analysis. As we discussed in the introduction,
the choice of the time frame for the analysis is extremely important. Early tax incidence
analysis used current income as the base i.e. it compared the tax liability over a short
period to income earned over that period. Following Friedman (1957) and the permanent
income hypothesis, there was a realization that consumption decisions are made over a
longer time horizon. Hence income should be measured as the present discounted value
of lifetime earnings and inheritances. Failing to do so creates substantial measurement
problems, particularly at the low end of the income distribution. For example, elderly
people drawing down their savings in retirement will look poor when in fact, they may be
comfortably well off in a lifetime context. In other words, many low-income people are
not necessarily poor.6 Caspersen and Metcalf (1993) report cross tabulations on income

6

Pechman (1985) realized that income data for the low income groups suffered from substantial income
mismeasurement. Since then, the approach adopted by him and several others, including in this paper, is to

p. 4

and consumption that show that a large fraction of households are in consumption deciles
substantially above their income deciles.
Poterba (1989) follows the approach of using current consumption as a proxy for
permanent income, since if consumer behavior is consistent with the permanent income
hypothesis, then consumers would set current consumption proportional to permanent
income. However, as we mentioned earlier, using data from the 1987 Consumer
Expenditure Survey, Bull et al. (1994) show that consumption, instead of being smooth,
closely tracks current income over the lifecycle. Moreover, energy consumption also
shows a marked lifetime pattern.
This could be problematic for the incidence measurement. Suppose that as people
grow old their energy consumption becomes a larger share of their total consumption, and
suppose, as well, that over a lifetime the energy tax has a proportional incidence, then
using current consumption to measure lifetime income, the energy tax would appear
regressive.
As an alternative to current consumption, we use an adjusted lifetime measure for
consumption that is intended to correct for long-run predictable swings in behavior. This
measure was first employed in Bull et al. (1994). Ideally, a lifetime measure of incidence
would be constructed by taking the ratio of lifetime energy taxes to lifetime earnings.
Unfortunately, the lack of any sufficiently long longitudinal panel data set precludes such
an approach.7

discard the bottom half of the lowest decile i.e. to only look at the bottom 5-10 percent in the bottom decile,
rather than the entire 10 percent.
7
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has good data on income but lacks detailed data on
consumption which we would require. Other authors have used it to study the lifetime incidence of alcohol
and cigarette taxes (Lyon and Schwab, 1995) and gasoline taxes (Chernick and Reschovsky, 1992).

p. 5

To proxy for lifetime consumption, we therefore use the age profile of people
sampled in a particular year by the Consumer Expenditure Survey (a more detailed
detailed description of the calculation is presented in Bull et al. (1994)). In particular, we
first classify people into different subsamples based on their educational level, since the
pattern of income and consumption will be quite different for people with vastly different
human capital stocks. For each sub sample, we then calculate a “typical” path of
consumption through the averages for the age groups. For a given person in the sub
sample we know the ratio of their current consumption to the average for their age group.
We then compute their lifetime consumption by multiplying this ratio by the present
value of the typical lifetime path.
For example, suppose an individual is a 35-year-old PhD whose energy
consumption is 80 percent of the average for her age and education group. Let’s say the
present discounted value of total lifetime energy consumption for a person with a PhD is
$80,000. Then for this individual, the imputed lifetime energy consumption is $64,000.
This procedure allows the age profile of each variable to be different. This
flexibility helps to control for any confounding effects on the incidence calculation that
predictable lifetime patterns of consumption behavior introduce in the cross-section. For
example, suppose an alternative lifetime correction method was used where the share of
consumption received at age 35 was used as the correction method. If 5 percent of
consumption occurs on average at age 35 for a person in a given educational class, then
that person’s imputed lifetime consumption is 20 times their current consumption.
Suppose that the lifetime incidence correction did not renormalize for each variable
studied, but rather used the same correction factor for energy consumption. Then one

p. 6

would multiply current energy consumption by 20 to impute lifetime energy
consumption. But if in reality, 10 percent of energy consumption is spent on average at
age 35 for a person in a given educational class, then that person’s imputed lifetime
energy consumption should be 10 times their current energy consumption. Failing to
renormalize the incidence correction for each of the variables studied in this example
would incorrectly double lifetime energy consumption, biasing incidence results.
Using consumption as the base for measuring income also addresses the problem
of transitory income shocks. For instance, a downward shock to income may push the
recipient into a lower income decile, while leaving their energy consumption unchanged
(especially if the income shock is temporary). In this case, the ratio of energy taxes to
income would be higher than it would be under a correct lifetime measure. Similarly, an
upward shock to income may push the recipient into a higher income decile, while
leaving their energy consumption unchanged. Here, the ratio of energy taxes to income is
lower than it would be under a correct lifetime measure. The combination of these effects
would lead an income-based lifetime incidence correction to be biased toward
regressivity. When lifetime incidence is measured against consumption, however, such
transitory effects are less likely to lead to bias, since energy consumption and total
consumption are likely to react together to income shocks, if they react at all.
The final issue in an incidence analysis is how to allocate the tax burden. Taxes
on energy can be passed forward into higher consumer prices or backward in the form of
lower returns to factors of supply (capital, labor, and resource owners). A number of
large-scale general equilibrium models suggest that in the short to medium run, the
burden of a carbon tax will be passed forward into higher consumer prices. See, for

p. 7

example, Bovenberg and Goulder (2001) and Paltsev, et al. (2007) for recent studies
indicating that the short-run burden of a carbon tax will be essentially on consumers.
Based on the results of these and similar studies, we assume that the burden of the
carbon tax falls on consumers.
III. Methodology and Data
For purposes of our analysis, we consider the effect of a carbon tax set at a rate of
$15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide assuming it were in effect in three different years:
1987, 1997, and 2003. This allows us to see how changing consumption patterns over
time influence the distribution of the tax. Because we are considering a carbon tax in
different years, we deflate the tax rate to keep it constant in year 2005 dollars. Using the
CPI deflator, the tax rates we consider are $8.73 in 1987, $12.33 in 1997, and $14.13 in
2003. The incidence calculations require two types of data. First, to assess the impact of
the carbon tax on industry prices and subsequently on prices of consumer goods, we use
the Input-Output matrices provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Second,
once we have the predicted price increases for the consumer goods, we need to assess
incidence at the household level. For this, we used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey for various years. In this section, we explain
briefly our use of these two different data sets.
Energy related emissions of CO2 were 4,821 million tons in 1987, 5,422 million
tons in 1997, and 5,800 million tons in 2003. Given the tax rates and ignoring initial
reductions in emissions, the tax would raise $42.1 billion in 1987, $66.9 billion in 1997,
and $82.0 billion in 2003.8

8

An analysis by the Energy Information Administration suggests that a $15 tax on CO2 would reduce
emissions by about five percent in the short-run (see Energy Information Administration (2006)).

p. 8

We assume the tax is levied on coal at the mine mouth, natural gas at the well
head, and on petroleum products at the refinery. Imported fossil fuels are also subject to
the tax. As noted above we assume in all cases that the tax is passed forward to
consumers in the form of higher energy prices. Metcalf (2007) estimates that a tax of $15
per metric ton of CO2 applied to average fuel prices in 2005 would nearly double the
price of coal, assuming the tax is fully passed forward. Petroleum products would
increase in price by nearly 13 percent and natural gas by just under 7 percent. The tax is
also passed on indirectly to other industries that use these energy sources as inputs.
The procedure for evaluating the effect of a carbon tax as it is passed through the
economy is discussed in detail in Fullerton (1995) and Metcalf (1999). We provide a
summary of the methodology in the Appendix. The starting point for the analysis is the
use of Input-Output matrices available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In
particular, we use the Summary Make and Use matrices from the I-O tables for 1987,
1997, and 2003. The Make matrix shows how much each industry makes of each
commodity and the Use matrix shows how much of each commodity is used by each
industry. Using these two matrices for each year, we derive an industry-by-industry
transactions matrix which enables us to trace the use of inputs by one industry by all
other industries. Various adding-up identities along with assumptions about production
and trade allow the accounts to be manipulated to trace through the impact of price
changes (and taxes) in one industry on the products of all other industries in the economy.
For each year, we cluster the industry groups provided in the I-O tables into 60
categories. For 2003, we separate out aggregate mining into two separate groups, mining
and coal mining using the split provided in the 2002 benchmark I-O files. We do a

p. 9

similar split to break out electricity and natural gas from other utilities. This was not a
problem for the 1987 and 1997 benchmark I-O files, where these splits already existed.
Once we obtained the effect of the tax on prices of consumer goods, we used data
from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to compute energy taxes paid by each
household in the survey. The CEX contains data on household income and expenditures
for numerous consumption goods. We combine commodities to work with 42 categories
of personal consumption items. Having computed the average price increase for each
industry using the Input-Output tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, we
translate those price increases into corresponding price increases for these consumer
items. This is also discussed in detail in the Appendix, and we provide tables showing the
recorded price increases in each year for each consumer item as a result of the tax.
IV. Results
Table 1 presents our results for incidence using annual income as our measure of
economic welfare. We have grouped households by annual income and sorted the
households into ten income deciles from the poorest ten percent of the population to the
richest ten percent. Confirming conventional wisdom, the carbon tax is quite regressive
when measured relative to current income for all three years. The burden in the lowest
decile in 1997 and 2003, for example, is over four times the burden in the top decile
when measured as a fraction of annual income.
TABLE AND FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE
Figure 1 shows that the overall burden distribution has not changed substantially
across the sixteen year period when annual income is used to rank households. There is a
slight flattening of the average tax rate curve across the three years. The burden has

p. 10

fallen by roughly one half a percentage point in the bottom three deciles while only
falling roughly two-tenths of a percentage point in the top three deciles. The overall
burden is declining slightly over time from 1.54 percent of income in 1987 to 1.30
percent by 2003. This in part reflects the greater energy efficiency of the economy.
Aggregate energy intensity in the United States (measured as energy consumption
relative to real GDP) fell by 23 percent between 1987 and 2003.9
Table 2 (and Figure 2) show the burden of the direct component of the tax in the
three years. The direct component of the tax is highly regressive – the average tax rate in
the bottom decile is 4.9 times the average tax rate in the highest decile in 1987, 6.3 times
in 1997 and 5.7 times in 2003. As with the total burden, the direct burden is declining
slightly over the sixteen year period. The overall direct burden declines from 0.79
percent of income in 1987 to 0.73 percent in 1997 and to 0.58 percent by 2003.
TABLE AND FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE
Table 3 and Figure 3 shows that the indirect burden is relatively constant over this
time period. The regressivity of the indirect portion of the tax has increased slightly with
the burden in the lowest decile rising from 2.5 times the burden in the top decile in 1987
to 3.6 times in 2003. That the indirect component of the tax is regressive but to a lesser
extent than the direct component is consistent with the observation of Herendeen, Ford,
and Hannon (1981) that indirect and direct energy consumption profiles differ in shape.
TABLE AND FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE
In summary, had a carbon tax been in effect in 1987, 1997, and 2003, the tax
would have looked quite regressive using annual income as a measure of household well
being. Using an annual income approach, the regressivity is increasing slightly over this
9

See Metcalf (2007b) for an analysis of the determinants of changes in energy intensity.

p. 11

time period. The overall burden falls a bit with the decline primarily attributable to
declines in the direct burden of the tax.
Turning to the measures of incidence using consumption as a proxy for lifetime
income, the results change dramatically. Table 4 (and Figure 4) shows the distribution of
the carbon tax in the three years when households are sorted by current consumption.
Now we find that the total carbon tax is less regressive, with the ratio of average taxes
paid by the bottom and the top varying from about 1.6 to 1.8 across the three years.
TABLE AND FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE
The next two tables and figures demonstrate that nearly all of this regressivity can
be accounted for by the direct component of the tax, since the indirect component is
roughly proportional between the top and bottom deciles. Even the direct component is
less regressive than when we used current income to construct average tax rates. The
ratio of direct taxes paid by the bottom and top deciles ranges between about 2.4 and 2.6
the three years. This is nearly half the ratio when we used current income as the welfare
measure. The indirect burden is slightly progressive in 1987 but becomes essentially
proportional in the latter two years.
TABLES AND FIGURES 5, 6 ABOUT HERE
Turning to the measures of average tax burdens using lifetime consumption
(Tables 7, 8, and 9), we see that this correction flattens the distribution even more.
Indeeed, the burden is now slightly progressive over the bottom half of the income
distribution. The incidence of the total carbon tax is nearly proportional, with the ratio of
burden in the lowest to top decile varying from 1.3 to 1.4 across the three years. Both the
direct and the indirect components of the tax are the least regressive using this measure.

p. 12

As with the current consumption proxy for lifetime income in 1987, the indirect tax using
our lifetime income measure is marginally progressive.
TABLES AND FIGURES 7-9 ABOUT HERE
In summary, incidence calculations based upon annual income imply much
steeper regressivity than do calculations based upon lifetime income proxies. Moreover,
the inter-temporal variation in incidence is reduced substantially using measures based on
lifetime consumption rather than those using income. We suspect this occurs in large part
because transitory income shocks exacerbate the apparent regressivity of the tax when
measured against income.
V. Regional Incidence of the Tax
In this section, we will focus on the regional incidence of the tax. Policy makers
are often concerned that a tax might disproportionately burden one region or part of the
country at the expense of another. To measure the geographic burden of the tax, we
group households by region and measure their average tax rate using weighted averages
of the tax burdens.10 Results are shown in Tables (and Figures) 10, 11 and 12. Variation
in the average tax rates peaks in 1997 and is quite modest by 2003. The maximum
difference in the average rate across regions is less than two-thirds of a percentage point
in 1987. The maximum difference rises to 0.9 percentage points in 1997 and then falls to
just over one-third of a percentage point in 2003. It is quite remarkable how small the
differences are across the regions given the variation in weather conditions and driving
patterns across the regions.
TABLE AND FIGURE 10 ABOUT HERE

10

As with the distributional tables across income, we drop the bottom five percent of the income
distribution from the analysis before carrying out the regional analysis.

p. 13

Tables 11 and 12 indicate that the bulk of the variation across regions in carbon
tax payments arises from the direct portion of the tax. This is perhaps not surprising
given that purchased commodities are increasingly traded across regions in the United
States leading to homogenization of the indirect carbon tax effect.

VI. Conclusion
This paper measures the incidence of carbon taxes using a lifetime incidence
framework. We analyze the household burden of a $15 per metric ton tax on CO2 in
constant 2005 dollars at three different points in time. The burden is measured ranking
households by current income, current consumption and lifetime consumption as the
basis for the incidence measures. The methodology involves first working with the
economy-wide Input-Output tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to assess how
the $15 tax would affect the industrial sector, in particular the prices of energy goods and
other industrial goods in which these energy goods serve as inputs. We then use this
information to calculate the increase in prices of consumer goods as a result of the tax.
Once we obtain the price increase in 42 categories of consumer goods, we calculate the
burden of the tax on households using consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure
Survey.
As the paper discusses, energy taxes have different incidence effects across the
lifecycle. Therefore, it is important to measure the burden of taxes in terms of lifetime
incidence, not just their burden in a given year. To take account of the lifetime incidence,
we use two proxies. First we use current consumption following work of Poterba (1989).

p. 14

Second we use lifetime-corrected consumption introduced in Bull et al. (1994) and
explained in detail in the Appendix to that paper.
Our results suggest that when the total lifetime effect of a carbon tax is taken into
account, the regressivity of the tax decreases. This is particularly true when we use
lifetime-corrected consumption to rank households, rather than current consumption.
While the direct tax effect continues to be regressive to varying extents depending upon
the incidence measure we use, the indirect effect is much more proportional, thus
mitigating the effect of direct taxes on total taxes. This is particularly true for the year
1987 when the indirect tax appears to be mildly progressive.
In addition to looking at the economic incidence of the tax, we studied the
incidence of the tax across regions. These data show that the variation across regions is
relatively modest with the variation decreasing over time.
Our results suggest that a carbon tax is far less regressive than is generally
assumed when the analysis is done on a lifetime basis. This suggests that concerns over
the distributional impact of a shift to a carbon tax may be overstated. It should be
emphasized that we have not addressed how the revenues of the tax are utilized, either to
lower other taxes, reduce the deficit, or finance new spending. Metcalf (2007) presents
an analysis of a carbon tax reform that is distributionally neutral when evaluated in an
annual income framework. The results of this analysis suggest that such a reform may be
progressive when analyzed in a lifetime income framework.
Our results also suggest an interesting area for future research. If a carbon tax
applies only to indirect energy consumption, then it would be almost distributionally
neutral, and accomplish that without any additional changes to the tax code. Future

p. 15

research should explore whether environmental objectives could be achieved with such a
tax, and evaluate the other economic consequences of applying the tax to the indirect
base only.

Appendix
1. Using the Input-Output Accounts (based on Fullerton, 1995, and Metcalf, 1999)
The Input-Output accounts trace through the production of commodities by
industries and the use of those commodities by industries. The Bureau of Economic
Analysis provides two kinds of matrices that help us to track such transactions through
the economy. The Make-matrix, MIxC, shows how much each industry makes of each
commodity, and the Use-matrix, UCxI, shows how much of each commodity is used by
each industry. Combining these two, we can derive the industry-by-industry transactions
matrix by dividing each entry of MIxC by its column sum and multiplying the resulting
matrix by the use matrix, UCxI. Using the resulting matrix, it is possible to trace the use of
inputs by one industry by all other industries. Further, it is also possible to trace through
the impact of price changes in one industry on the products of all other industries in the
economy. Below we detail some of the steps involved.
Tracing price changes through the economy on the basis of Input-Output accounts
dates back to work by Leontief (1986). The model makes a number of important
assumptions, the most important of which are (1) goods are produced and sold in a
perfectly competitive environment such that all factor price increases are passed forward
to consumers, (2) domestic and foreign goods are sufficiently different so that the price of
domestic goods can adjust following changes in factor prices (Armington, 1969) and (3)
input coefficients (the amount of industry i used in the production of industry j) are
constant. Thus, input substitution is not allowed as factor prices change. This last
assumption means that price responses are only approximate as they don’t allow for

p. 21

product mix changes as relative prices change. In effect, the Input-Output accounts can
be used to trace first-order price effects through the economy.
Two sets of equations define the basic Input-Output accounts. The first set relates
the demand for goods from an industry to the value of output from that industry:
x11 p1 + x12 p1 + ..... + x1N p1 + d1 p1 = x1 p1
x 21 p 2 + x 22 p 2 + .... + x 2 N p 2 + d 2 p 2 = x 2 p 2
.
.
.
x N 1 p N + x N 2 p N + .... + x NN p N + d N p N = x N p N

[1]

Where xij is the quantity of the output from industry i used by industry j, pi is the unit
price of product i, di is the final demand for output i and xi is the total output of industry i.
These N equations simply say that the value of output from each industry must equal the
sum of the value of output used by other industries (intermediate inputs) plus final
demand. Without loss of generality, we can choose units for each of the goods so that all
prices equal 1. This will be convenient as the expenditure data in the Input-Output
accounts can then be used to measure quantities prior to any taxes that we impose.
The second set of equations relates the value of all inputs and value added to the
value of output:
x11 p1 + x 21 p 2 + ..... + x N 1 p N + v1 = x1 p1
x12 p1 + x 22 p 2 + .... + x N 2 p N + v 2 = x 2 p 2
.
.
.

[2]

x1N p1 + x 2 N p 2 + .... + x NN p N + v N = x N p N
Where vi is value added in industry i. Define aij=xij/xj, the input of product i as a
fraction of the total output of industry j. The system [2] can be written as
p. 22

(1 − a11 ) p1 − a 21 p 2 − ..... − a N 1 p N = v1 / x1
− a12 p1 + (1 − a 22 ) p 2 − .... − a N 2 p N = v 2 / x 2
.
.
.
− a1N p1 − a 2 N p 2 − .... − a NN p N = v N / x N

[3]

These equations can be expressed in matrix notation as
( I − A′) P1 = V

[3A]

Where I is an NxN identity matrix, A is an NxN matrix with elements aij, PI is an Nx1
vector of industry prices, pi, and V is the Nx1 vector whose ith element is vi/xi. Assuming
that ( I − A′) is nonsingular, this system can be solved for the price vector:
PI = ( I − A′) −1V

[4]

With the unit convention chosen above, PI, will be a vector of ones. However, we can add
taxes to the system in which case the price vector will now differ from a vector of ones as
intermediate goods taxes get transmitted through the system. Specifically, let tij be a unit
tax on the use of product i by industry j. In this case, the value of goods used in
production (grossed up by their tax) plus value added now equals the value of output:
x11 p1 (1 + t11 ) + x 21 p 2 (1 + t 21 ) + ..... + x N 1 p N (1 + t N 1 ) + v1 = x1 p1
x12 p1 (1 + t12 ) + x 22 p 2 (1 + t 22 ) + .... + x N 2 p N (1 + t N 2 ) + v 2 = x 2 p 2
.
.
.
x1N p1 (1 + t1N ) + x 2 N p 2 (1 + t 2 N ) + .... + x NN p N (1 + t NN ) + v N = x N p N

[5]

This set of equations can be manipulated in a similar fashion to the equations above to
solve for the price vector:
PI = ( I − B ′)V

[6]

p. 23

where B is an NxN matrix with elements (1+tij)aij.
We regrouped industries in the Input-Output Accounts into 58 industry groupings.
For the years 2003 and 1997, a separate industry for coal mining was created out of the
industry group including all mining. This was done using the split between mining and
coal provided in the 1994 benchmark Input-Output accounts. For the year 1987, we used
the benchmark Input-Output table which already has coal mining as a separate industry.
Tax rates are computed as the ratio of tax required tax revenue from the industry
divided by the value of output from that industry. For the carbon tax, the tax rate equals
t 4. =

20
N

∑x
j =1

4j

where the tax is designed to collect $20 billion from the coal industry (industry 4). This
tax is applied to all variables in the third equation of Equation [5]. Other industry level
taxes are computed in a similar manner.
Equation [6] indicates how price changes in response to the industry level taxes.
We next have to allocate the price responses to consumer goods. The Input-Output
accounts provide this information by means of the PCE Bridge tables for each year that
show how much of each consumer item is produced in each industry. Let Z be an NxM
matrix, where zij represents the proportion of consumer good j (j=1,..,M) derived from
industry i (i=1,….,N). The columns of Z sum to 1. An example of the Z-matrix is
provided in Appendix Table 2 for a subset of consumer goods. If Pc is a vector of
consumer goods prices (an Mx1 vector), then
Pc = Z ′P1.

p. 24

The consumer prices derived using this methodology are then applied to consumption
data in the CEX. The consumer prices derived using this methodology is provided in
Appendix Table 1 for all three years.
