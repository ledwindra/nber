    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate the impact of state-level \u201cE-Verify\u201d legislation that mandates employment eligibility verification for private-sector workers.  We document declines in formal sector employment and employment turnover after mandate passage, with effects concentrated among those likeliest to be work-ineligible. Using newly available data, we show that larger firms are far more likely to comply with mandates. Heterogeneity in adherence leads to substantial within-state employment spillovers from larger to smaller firms, as well as a reduction in the number of large firms. We find no evidence that work-ineligible populations relocate or that native-born workers\u2019 labor market outcomes improve in response to mandates.\n\n",
