The Crash of 1882, Counterparty Risk, and the Bailout of the Paris Bourse
Eugene N. White
NBER Working Paper No. 12933
February 2007
JEL No. E58,G18,N23
ABSTRACT
The rapid growth of derivative markets has raised concerns about counterparty risk. It has been argued
that their mutual guarantee funds provide an adequate safety net. While this mutualization of risk protects
clients and brokers from idiosyncratic shocks, it is generally assumed that it also offers protection
against systemic shocks, largely based on the observation that no twentieth century exchange has been
forced to shut down. However, an important exception occurred in 1882 when the crash of the French
stock market nearly forced the closure of the Paris Bourse. This exchange's structure was very similar
to today's futures markets, with a dominant forward market leading the Bourse to adopt a common
fund to guarantee transactions. Using new archival data, this paper shows how the crash overwhelmed
the Bourse's common fund. Only an emergency loan from the Bank of France, intermediated by the
largest banks, prevented a closure of the Bourse.

The spectacular crash of the French stock market in 1882 inaugurated a deep
recession that lasted until the end of the decade.1 Unlike other stock market busts, the
surprising features of the 1882 crisis were that it was largely confined to France
(Kindleberger, 1993) and it nearly brought about the demise of the Paris Bourse. In his
magisterial study of the crash, Jean Bouvier (1960) detailed the rise and fall of the bank,
Union Générale, which played a central role in boom and collapse of the market.
However, Bouvier focused less on the propagation of the crisis and more on the
politically charged question of whether there was a conspiracy to bring down the bank. In
the wake of the crash, the bank’s founder alleged that its demise was caused by JewishGerman banks and Freemasons who sought to destroy emerging financial institutions that
backed a conservative Catholic political agenda. This myth found favor with the antiSemitic right (Ferguson, 1999).

Bouvier (1960, 1968) concluded that there was no

evidence of a conspiracy and that Union Générale was destroyed by its leveraged position
and accounting fraud.

While Bouvier’s findings have been generally accepted, what

remains unclear is why the collapse of this bank proved to be so devastating. Using new
archival materials and data on the finances of the Bourse, this paper examines how the
Bourse’s common fund failed to safeguard the liquidity of the exchange. This failure
stands out as an extraordinary exception to the otherwise exemplary record of similar
institutions in the twentieth century that are cited as examples of how markets can
effectively manage risk privately and reduce the danger of a liquidity crisis (Edwards,
1984; Bernanke, 1990; and Kroszner, 1999 and 2000).
In the French market, forward contracts were the primary instrument for trading
securities; and in rapidly moving markets, these contracts could expose brokers to
substantial counterparty risk. Well before futures markets set up guarantee systems, the
Paris Bourse recognized these problems and created a common fund designed to
guarantee the completion of contracts.

However, while this fund could manage

idiosyncratic, it was unable to absorb a systemic shock. In the midst of the 1882 crash,
fourteen of the sixty stock brokers appeared to be in imminent danger of failure and
seven ultimately proved to be insolvent. The more severely afflicted bourse of Lyon was
liquidated, and closure of the Paris Bourse was only averted by an emergency loan from

the Bank of France, mediated by a syndicate of bankers. This timely credit from the
lender of last resort ensured there was sufficient liquidity for the end-of-January
settlement of forward contracts.

These events have no parallel today or in the other

stock markets of the era. An equivalent disaster in the U.S. would have resulted in the
closure of the Boston or Philadelphia exchanges and the rescue of the New York Stock
Exchange by an emergency loan from the U.S. Treasury.2 The Bourse managed to repay
the emergency loan by levying an assessment on its members.

But recovery and

recapitalization of the common fund lasted until the end of the decade, weakening the
Bourse at a critical time when it faced increasing competition from the Coulisse (the curb
market).
I. The Microstructure of the Paris Bourse
The Paris Bourse was founded by Napoleon’s decree of 27 Prairial X (June 16,
1802).3 Combined with a law enacted on 28 Ventôse IX (March 19, 1801) and the Code
de Commerce in 1807, it set the basic microstructure of the nineteenth century exchange.
These laws gave the agents de change or stock brokers a monopoly of trade in
government securities and other securities “susceptible” to being quoted.4 The remaining
securities were left to the free market or the Coulisse. Entry was strictly regulated, each
agent de change was required to post a bond of 60,000 francs, later raised to 100,000 in
1805; and the number of brokers was fixed at sixty in 1816.

New brokers were

nominated by their predecessor, subject to the approval of the bourse. The agents de
change formed a corporation, the Compagnie des Agents de Change that was governed
by a chambre syndicale. This governing committee was elected by the members and led
by a syndic.
The brokers were forbidden to trade on their own account by the Code de
Commerce (Article 85).5

Commissions were fixed and determined by the chambre

syndicale. Yet, the Napoleonic laws had very little to say about the rules that would

through the Napoleonic era.

This definition led to a long struggle between the Bourse and the Coulisse over which securities the
former had exclusive trading rights.

The curb brokers were not prohibited from making a market, although they were legally obliged to notify
their clients when they traded on their own account as a counterparty.

govern trading.6 Article 22 of the 1802 decree charged the brokers with the creation of
the rules needed for “internal discipline.” These rules would then be forwarded to the
Ministry of the Interior (after 1816, the Ministry of Finance) to receive government
approval and thereby gain legal sanction.
There was, however, one important restriction that Napoleon imposed on trading.
Although the cash market for securities (marché au comptant) was left unregulated, the
forward market (marché à terme) was not given legal status. Napoleon shared traditional
suspicions that short selling fostered speculation and insisted that forward trading remain
outside the law. The decree of 1802 enjoined brokers to have in their possession
securities for selling customers and cash for buying customers before they traded.
Although left in legal limbo, the forward market soon became larger than the cash
market. Because no merchandise or cash changed hands, time contracts were treated as
gambling debts. According to Article 1965 of the Code Civil, the state would not enforce
a gambling debt (Vidal, 1910.). This principle was tested several times in the courts and
the established position was maintained. In 1842, the leading bankers sent a memorial to
the government, pleading for the forward market to be made legal; but they were
rebuffed. In 1867, an Imperial commission was appointed to investigate the question and
concluded in favor of revising the law; but only after the crash of 1882 was there
sufficient political pressure. Forward contracts became legally enforceable after the
passage of the Law of June 28, 1885.

Although most customers honored their

commitments because they wanted to remain active in the market, the possibility that
they could walk away from large losses added to the potential risk in the forward
contracts, though it was not the sole factor as some contemporaries presumed.
A distinctive physical feature of the Paris bourse was the ring around which the
agents de change congregated. Protected by an outer rail or barrier, the brokers faced
one another around an inner ring or corbeille, while trading orders were delivered to them
by their clerks (commis), and commission brokers (remisiers). Brokers announced their
orders to their colleagues around the corbeille, seeking counterparties. The agents de
change handled the official forward market for securities. On the petites corbeilles,

Yet, it remained largely self-governed.

smaller rings, their clerks operated the official cash market for securities and the official
forward market for French rentes. These markets were in the central hall of the bourse—
the parquet—named for its flooring. The rest of the market, the Coulisse was taken up by
the curb brokers or coulissiers who worked outside under the peristyle of the building.7
By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the Bourse developed a distinct set
of rules for trading. Orders were announced by brokers in a continuous market, with
clerks moving back and forth from the floor to their office stations, relaying information
about prices and receiving new orders. In the cash market, orders were given to the
brokers at a fixed price (à cours fixe), a best price (au mieux) or the average price (au
cours moyen), which were good until cancelled by the customer.8 However, the forward
market was the dominant market, where large investors and speculators typically
operated. Here, buyers and sellers agreed to exchange a fixed number of shares for a
fixed price on the fifteenth day or the end of the month.9 Bulls or haussiers would buy in
the marché à terme with the intention of reselling at a higher price, while bears or
baissiers sold contracts, expecting prices to fall.
Although securities and cash were not in hand, risk to the broker was controlled
partly by margin (couverture). No regulations governed margin, which was determined
by the broker on the basis of the securities in question and the client’s account in general
(Proudhon, 1857).10 Although it was common for brokers to obtain margin and demand
an increase if the value of a security fell quickly, it was not until 1890 that brokers were
given the legal right to demand and receive margin (Robert-Milles, 1892; Boissière,
1908, and Poiteux, 1928). Margin was set to prevent defaults when prices changes were
in the “normal range.” It was the first line of defense against a defaulting customer.
However margin imposed a real cost on traders, and brokers were obviously reluctant to
7

See also, Walter (2001) for additional details.
At the end of the day, the highest and lowest of the prices were averaged to obtain the average price at
which the orders au cours moyen would be executed. (Vidal (1910), pp. 34-36)
9
The duration of these contracts was determined by settlement dates (liquidations). Settlements were
semi-monthly on the fiftheenth (liquidation de quinzaine) and the last day of the month (liquidation de
ultimo), or the following day if it was a holiday. The exceptions were the French rentes, shares of Crédit
Foncier, and railroads which were only settled at the end of the month (Vidal, pp. 70-71). The number of
days for clearing varied, depending on whether the transaction occurred in the cash or forward market and
whether it was a registered security (titre nominantif), which bore the name of the owner, or a bearer
security (titre au porteur), where the holder was presumed to be the owner (Vidal, 1910).
10
Similarly, before the New Deal imposed margin requirements in the United States, margin was set at the
discretion of the broker.

set margin so high that it would rule out all possible price changes, especially those
resulting from extremely rare events such as crashes (Bernanke, 1990).
Settlement day forced traders in the forward market to decide if they wanted to
liquidate their positions. A buyer might not want to take the securities if the current cash
price was below the contract price. In the hope that the price might rise in the future, a
buyer could renew his position by means of a report. If he had contracted to buy on the
fifteenth of the month, then on that date he would buy at the agreed upon price and
immediately sell the securities at the clearing price, or cours de compensation, entering a
new forward contract to repurchase the securities at the next settlement date.

The

difference between the two prices was the cours de report. The cours de compensation
was fixed on the settlement day by the syndic and was usually the average quoted price
for that day in the cash market. The investor, or reporté, obtained funds for this operation
from reporteurs who were financial institutions or agents de change.11

II. Counterparty Risk and the Common Fund
In futures or forward markets, there is significant risk of default on contractual
obligations because of the lag in time between contract and delivery dates. During the
course of a contract, losses can grow, exacerbated by the incentive for a customer in
distress to take on more risk (Kroszner, 1999). Brokers on the Bourse thus faced the risk
that a customer might default, when unexpected changes in the customer’s net wealth
affected his or her ability to meet their contractual obligations. If a customer was unable
to settle his account, he was subject to a procedure known as an exécution.

In an

execution, a broker was obliged to complete his customer’s transaction, buying-in and
selling-out the securities; and if the margin were insufficient, the broker absorbed the loss
(Boissière, 1908).
But, there is an additional risk factor, counterparty risk. In the process of clearing
and settlement, the failure of one broker could produce losses for other brokers. On the
Paris Bourse, if a broker defaulted, the syndic, on behalf of the chambre syndicale, made
an exécution against the broker buying-in and selling-out the securities for the other
brokers. This counterparty risk is a significant problem for forward and futures markets,
11

See Courtois (1892).

6

and the bankruptcy of one broker can yield large and extensive losses to others. For
example, the failure of one member of the Chicago Board of Trade in 1902 led to some
losses for 42 percent of the members (Moser, 1998).
The high volume and rapid speed of the verbal market on the parquet required
customers and brokers to be certain that their orders would be completed. Consequently,
the Bourse adopted rules to control counterparty risk.

Surveying the regulations

contemporary exchanges use to manage this risk, Edwards (1984) found that they
employed a mix of expulsion, monitoring, margin, position and capital requirements, and
price limits, some of which were explicit and others discretionary.

While margin

requirements tied to other regulations were the first line of defense, the integrity of
transactions on these exchanges was ultimately protected by a guarantee fund coupled
with ex post member assessments. This mutualization of counterparty risk through the
agency of an exchange (usually with the fund based in the exchange’s clearing house),
thus ensures the market’s liquidity, allowing investors to trade without concern about the
creditworthiness of their counterparties. However, mutualizing counterparty risk makes
it necessary for an exchange to devise regulations and a monitoring system to manage the
resulting problems of adverse selection and moral hazard (Edwards, 1984; Bernanke,
1990).
In advance of the futures markets, the Paris Bourse developed a very similar set of
regulations and institutional structure to ensure the successful completion of all trades
and manage counterparty risk in the early nineteenth century. Had the letter of the law of
1802 been applied and trades were made with securities and cash in hand, there would
have been minimal counterparty risk, but the time delay in forward contracts created the
potential for large risks.

The need to control counterparty risk on the Bourse had

emerged very quickly.

Beginning in 1818, the hottest question in the General

Assembly’s meetings was whether to establish a common fund.12 Responding to several
failures, a common fund, the caisse commune was established in 1822 to provide
12

The bourse of the ancien régime had maintained a small fund to pay for collective expenses, but it had
not common fund. In the nineteenth century European coffee and grain markets were the first futures
markets to create liquidation funds (caisses de liquidation) to guarantee full payment to the injured parties
by collecting from the defaulter and drawing from a members’ mutual fund (Emery, 1896). Diffusion of
was slow. In the U.S. the Minneapolis Grain Exchange was the first to employ this system in 1891. It only
adopted by the Chicago Board of Trade in 1925 (Moser, 1998).

temporary credit to an illiquid broker or in case of insolvency permit an orderly
liquidation that would not halt other brokers’ operations.13
Given that a mutual guarantee was offered, moral hazard became a problem and
monitoring to limit increased risk-taking was needed. Even though the small number of
brokers facilitated mutual monitoring, the chambre syndicale began to require twice
yearly reports of brokers’ income and capital.

When one of the sixty seats became

There were no capital requirements, but by

1880 a broker’s total capital, including the 250,000 franc security bond and his 100,000
franc share in the common fund, was quite high, typically 1.5 to 2.5 million francs.
Using the archives of the Paris Bourse, I obtained the caisse commune’s income
statements and balance sheets. The revenues and expenditures of the Compagnie des
agents de change for 1873 to 1913 are presented in Figure 1 and given in greater detail
for the critical years of the crash in Table 1.14 The ordinary operation of the common
fund can be seen in events of the year 1873. The Compagnie secured almost all of its
revenue from three sources: a stamp tax, brokerage fees for the rentes, and interest for
funds invested in reports. By far the most important source was a stamp tax imposed on
the special paper used by brokers to record their operations, the price of which was
determined by the brokers in their General Assembly. Roughly, this was a tax on the
volume of activity on the bourse and it was borne in proportion to the activity of each
broker.15 The greater a broker’s volume, the greater his exposure to this risk, and hence
this revenue had a positive relationship with counterparty risk. In 1873, the stamp tax
provided 4.1 million of a total of 5.5 million francs of revenue.

The next most

importance source of revenue was the brokerage fees (courtages) obtained from the
Treasury’s trading activities. In 1862, the Fonds Spécial des Trésoreries Générales was
established to handle the orders to buy and sell French rentes for government’s tax
collectors (receveurs généraux), rather than have individual agents execute them. To
manage this operation a special fund was created, with a precautionary reserve. The
income from the fees on these trades was 922,425 francs in 1873. The last significant

members.

Expenses for 1873 totaled 787,300 francs. The largest element of expenditures
was salaries for the bourse’s personnel including the guards and concierges, which were
255,700 francs, followed by rent, taxes, and insurance totaling 78,308 francs. Remaining
expenditures included legal fees, clearing operations, and telegraphy. The Compagnie set
its expected revenue much higher than its expenses to ensure that there was a sufficient
buffer against counterparty risk. Consequently, the Compagnie was left with a large
surplus of 4,728,619 francs, which could have been added to the common fund or rebated
to the brokers. Some extra income was annually transferred to the common fund but
most of this surplus was rebated to the members. For 1872-1873, the Compagnie added
108,620 francs to the reserves of the common fund and rebated 4,620,000 francs or

77,000 francs to each broker.17 The rebate was not proportional to the members’ payment
of the stamp taxes or other sources but was distributed in equal shares, thus redistributing
some revenue from higher to lower volume brokers. The surplus revenue was in effect a
refundable ex ante assessment against potential losses, where the assessment was set in
rough proportion to the business each broker conducted and hence his exposure to risk.
Given the redistribution, the Paris brokers must have been deeply concerned about
counterparty risk, as it has been argued (Pirrong, 1997) that the Chicago Board of Trade
did not adopt a mutual fund until 1925 because of objections by strong members to the
implicit subsidy to weaker members and the potential for moral hazard.

Total Common Fund

This rebate was distributed twice yearly after the liquidations of May 31 and November 30. There was an
additional 10,498 francs in the Common Fund, representing assets to be recovered.

In its annual report to the General Assembly, the accounting committee for the
caisse commun reported that on November 10, 1873, the common fund stood at
7,558,394 francs.

Figure 2 shows the common fund for 1873-1913, with Table 2,

focusing on the years 1873-1890. Each agent de change owned a one sixtieth of the fund.
The fund was administered by the syndic, and it was monitored by a deputy (adjoint) of
the syndic and three agents de change appointed by the General Assembly. The largest
component of the common fund, 6 million francs, was composed of the 100,000 franc
security bonds deposited by the 60 brokers. To this was added the reserve of 644,304
francs for the Trésoreries Générales.

Un-rebated surplus revenue over the years had

contributed to secondary reserve of 794,972 francs by the end of the previous year. The
108,620 francs for 1872-1873 raised this reserve to 903,592 francs. Most of the common
fund was placed in reports, earning interest, except for the reserves for Treasury
transactions that were held in rentes.

If a broker requested a loan from the caisse commune, he had to provide collateral
equal to the advance from his security bond, and the chambre syndicale set the interest on
the advance. Further collateral came from a broker’s office or seat on the exchange. If a
broker failed, he could not obtain a loan from the common fund, and the chambre
syndicale substituted itself for the defaulting agent to wind up his affairs and make good
on his obligations. The years 1873 and 1874 were without incident; additions were made
to the surplus of the common fund, but most revenue was rebated to the brokers.

III. L’affaire Jumel: an idiosyncratic shock
A typical operation of the common fund can be seen in the failure of the broker
Alexis-Alphonse Jumel, in 1875.

Jumel had been an agent de change since 1867.

Although little is known about the circumstances of his failure, Jumel was forced to give
up his office on May 7, 1875.18 On August 23, the General Assembly voted to pay out
1,590,000 francs to wind up Jumel’s position. Of this sum, 250,000 francs represented
the seizure of his security bond, 340,000 francs from his assets, and 1,000,000 francs
from the reserves of the caisse commune.19
Jumel’s demise proved costly to brokers who had traded heavily with him. After
the cancellation of his bond, the Compagnie paid one-third of the value of his outstanding
debts to fellow brokers. His trading apparently had been highly concentrated, and this
partial compensation was a big hit for certain agents de change. Paul-Alphonse SaintEvron experienced the greatest loss and received a third of what Jumel owed him or
136,206 francs out of a total debt of 412,746 francs.20 The remaining brokers received
one-third of the value of their claims or 814,625 francs, with 389,168 francs set aside for
obligations coming due. Nevertheless, all the Bourse’s customers who had been on the
other side of Jumel’s trades were made whole, ensuring confidence in the exchange.
With surplus revenues of 4.1 million francs, the brokers in the General Assembly
could have paid out all of Jumel’s debts in full, which rose to 2,852,493 francs, but they

Saint-Evron was probably forced out of business by this and other losses, as he gave up his office on July
15, 1875.

13

did not. Instead, the common fund was allowed to drop from 7.9 to 7.4 million francs,
and 4.2 million francs was rebated to the brokers. Why the Assembly decided to saddle
the brokers trading heavily with Jumel with large losses was not explained. However, the
General Assembly seems to have thought that the brokers who had traded heavily with
him should have been more observant and did not want to burden all of the brokers’
equally.21 Using its discretionary authority to limit payments, the Compagnie was acting
in a manner consistent with increasing private incentives to monitor risky behavior and
thereby control the moral hazard created by the insurance fund.
In 1876, when revenues, especially those from the stamp tax fell, the secondary
reserve was little changed; but, as the syndic explained to the brokers in the General
Assembly, the Compagnie was obliged to pay out an unexpected 340,000 francs to settle
additional debts of Jumel.22 The next year, revenues continued to fall, and the rebate to
brokers was cut to 3.2 million francs with a small additional decline in the precautionary
reserve. Only in 1878, with revenues again on the rise, was the common fund increased,
as were rebates.23
Although the failure of an individual agent had produced substantial losses, it was
an idiosyncratic shock, related primarily to one broker. As such, the Compagnie could be
satisfied that its common fund gave adequate protection against counterparty risk.
However, the demise of Union Générale in 1882 overwhelmed the system, as it was a
systemic shock arising from the collapse of a new group of financial intermediaries.
Without assistance from the Bank of France, the Bourse would have collapsed
.

21

For American futures exchanges, Edwards (1984) noted that there was a trend away from unlimited
liability for the members of the clearing house fund.

made the final payment of 75,000 francs on his debts it was met with loud applause.
23
Expenditures rose by about 300,000 francs in 1880 due to 94,729 francs of work on a building, and other
higher expenses.

IV. Union Générale, and the Boom and Bust
The crash of 1882 is closely identified with the collapse of the investment bank
(banque des affaires), the Société de l’Union Générale, founded in 1878 by Paul-Eugène
Bontoux, an engineer and one-time employee of a Rothschild railroad company. In the
boom years of the late 1870s, many new enterprises in industry, construction, commerce,
and transportation at home and abroad flooded the Paris markets with new issues.
Bontoux organized a new financial network to channel French capital to Central and
Southern Europe, aiming to challenge the position of the Rothschild-Creditanstalt group
in Vienna. His plans also had a strong political agenda that appealed to French
conservatives, especially legitimist nobility and clergy frustrated by the success of the
Third Republic. Based in Lyon, Bontoux used Ultramontane and anti-Rothschild rhetoric
to induce conservative Catholic investors in France to buy shares and deposit their
savings in his bank (Bouvier, 1960).
Bontoux promoted his enterprises through a series of interlocking financial
institutions. Vidal (1910) estimated that the capital raised by Union Générale and its
affiliated enterprises to be one billion francs. Rapidly gaining deposits, the bank itself
increased its capital from 25 million to 50 million francs in 1879, 100 million francs in
1881, and finally a planned 150 million francs for January 1882.24 In 1881, Bontoux
founded the Austrian Österreichische Länderbank, in which the Union Générale had a
controlling interest.

The government in Vienna granted the new institution all the

privileges of the Bank of France except that of note issue. Together these institutions
became instruments of the Imperial Austrian government aimed at channeling capital to
railways that would enable it to dominate the Balkans. In the power vacuum created by
the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1878, Vienna was anxious to thwart Russia’s efforts
to establish its hegemony in the region.

Bontoux’s enterprises were central to the

government’s plans. To build the railways into the Balkans, Hungarian assent was also
required. In 1881, Bontoux persuaded the Hungarian Parliament to charter the Banque
Nationale Hongroise or the Ungarische Ländesbank and to subsidize new rail lines that
penetrated deep into the Balkans. Completing Bontoux’s master plan, this new bank was
controlled by its principal shareholders, the Union Générale and the Länderbank,
24

See Bouvier, (1960, pp. 47ff) for a description of the various stock issues and their pricing.

15

Following Bontoux’ success, enthusiasm for new investment opportunities in the
Balkans spread. Other new banks were created in Lyon, France’s second city. The
Banque de Lyon et de la Loire, was promoted by Charles Savary, who was married to the
daughter of the Parisian agent de change Paul-Edmond Mahou.25 When the bank opened
in April 1881, Savary was president and his in-laws were on the board. The initial capital
of 25 million was raised to 50 million in November, and it attracted local depositors with
high rates of interest. The bank promoted industrial enterprises, including many in
Russia. The established banks also joined in the boom. Credit Lyonnais doubled its
capital and acquired two insurance companies (Bouvier, 1960).
The general rise in the market can be seen in Arbulu’s (1998) stock market index
for the Paris market in Figure 3, where I have set January 1870 as the base month. At the
end of December 1879, this market index, which stood at 156, began its ascent. By the
end of the next year, it had reached 184, and peaked in December 1881 at 222, a height it
would not see again until July 1896, fifteen years later. Among the leading speculative
issues was Union Générale, rising from 500 francs a share in 1879 to over 3000 francs at
its apogee.
In the booming market for new securities, investors jumped into the forward
market. Speculators borrowed on credit, renewing their forward contracts from one
settlement to the next, hoping for steadily rising prices. Banks and new intermediaries
provided the funds for the reports. Flandreau and Sisic (2003) found that the four largest
banks roughly doubled the share of their assets invested in reports to 20% during the
boom. Specialized intermediaries, caisses de reports accepted deposits, which were
invested in reports, returning a high yield to the depositors. The Banque de Lyon et de la
Loire was very active in this market, investing heavily in reports; and it founded its own
caisse de reports, the Caisse Lyonnaise, to channel more funds to this business.

25

See Bouvier, (1960, p. 120). Mahou became deeply involved and failed in the crash (Archives de la
Bourse, dossier Mahou).

The brokers found the market extremely profitable. Not only did they benefit
from increased volume that yielded more brokerage fees, but they also profited from the
reports. The rising value of their offices is seen in Figure 4. Unlike the free market for
New York Stock Exchange seats, the market for “seats” on the Paris exchange was
influenced by the chambre syndicale, which gave out prices in response to inquiries by
brokers interested in selling their offices and carefully vetted new brokers. However, the
chamber syndicale did respond to market pressure; and prices moved steadily upwards
from 1.4 to 1.8 million francs from 1873 to 1881.26

26

After the long period of depressed seat prices following the crash, the Ministry of Finance took over the
market and set a price of 1.5 million francs.

Yet, in spite of their prosperity, many brokers became concerned. The syndic was
alarmed when the exchange was overwhelmed on the settlement days, with increasingly
long nights and long delays in clearing trades (Compte rendu, 1881, p. 1-2). In his 1882
annual report, the syndic, with some benefit of hindsight, described the madness that
overcame with market, claiming that he had been appalled by the rise in speculation and
had counseled prudence. He wrote, “It sufficed to announce a new company, sell it
shares and launch a new one.” He blamed the press and bankers for inflaming the
appetites of investors and compared the fever that hit Lyon with the madness of
Mississippi Bubble.

Bank of France Discount Rate

Open Market Paper

3 Percent Rentes

Source: NBER, www.nber.org, Macro history database, Series 11021, 13013, and 13017

But as the market reached new heights, interest rates began to rise. In this
favorable market, the French Treasury had issued a billion francs of 3% notes in July
1881. It attempted to market the issue directly to the public by permitting installment
payments, but this feature enabled leverage speculation using the reports (Say, 1886).
Then, a refinancing of the Italian debt produced a capital flow to Italy. When the Bank of
England raised its discount rate, the Bank of France followed and increased its lending
rate to 4% on August 25 1881, and 5% on October 20, 1881. The Bank of France’s
discount rate and the yields on the rentes and open market paper (used for international
trade) are shown in Figure 5. Open market paper had hovered at just over 3% for nearly
a year when the discount rate was 3%, now they both jumped to 5%. During the boom
19

years, the yield on the rentes had steadily declined; yet the yield curve, implicit in the
difference between the yields on the rentes and open market paper, remained upward
sloping. Now, the yield curve quickly flattened in late 1881, suggesting the imminence
of a recession.
As the boom continued, the reports became very expensive, although they varied
depending on the security and the lender. According the Bouvier (1960), the reports for
blue chip stocks cost 4 to 5% at the end of 1880, 8 to 10% in the Spring of 1881, then 10
to 12% in late 1881. Flandreau and Sicsic (2003) find that rates for the securities of the
major financial institutions were above 10% with the cost for carrying stock of the
Banque de Paris et Pays-Bas at 15% and for the Union Générale at 29%. These high rates
and especially those for more speculative stocks strongly suggest that lenders were
demanding a premium as the market moved higher, sensing a collapse was imminent.
These developments resemble those in the American call loan market at the peak of the
1929 boom. Rappoport and White (1994) showed that the rising interest rate premia and
climbing margin on these loans collateralized by stock indicated that the crash was
anticipated.

Savvy French contemporary observers recognized that at these rates

sustaining a bull market was impossible (Say, 1886).
Some major institutions, like Credit Lyonnais began to curtail their lending and
promotion of new issues (Bouvier, 1960). When the Marseilles branch of the bank
experienced a run in October 1881, Henri Germain, the head of the bank, ordered a
reduction of reports on the Lyon and Paris exchanges, though they were allowed to
finance the bank’s own stock (Bouvier, 1968). The French Treasury, worried about the
falling price of its new issue put 53 million francs into reports in early January (Say,
1886).
The collapse began when the Austrian government refused to give the Banque de
Lyon et de la Loire a concession for the creation of a Banque Maritime de Trieste
(Bouvier, 1860).

The bank’s shares fell from 1400 francs on January 4, 1882 to 540

francs on the January 13. Investors in the forward market who had purchased shares for
the mid-January settlement at 1800 francs faced huge losses. At the same time, the price
of a share in the Suez Company, a leading issue, fell from 3,440 francs on January 7 to
2,900 francs on January 14.

20

In this gathering storm, the price of Union Générale began to collapse. Although
its true condition only became clear later, it was compromised by serious financial
irregularities. The bank had not succeeded in selling all its capital and gave fictitious
subscriptions to bolster demand for its successive capital increases. In the final issue of
50 million francs in 1881, the bank held back 31,389 shares out of 100,000. Not only did
Union Générale have less capital than it had reported, but it was also heavily trading in its
own stock.

In addition, the bank falsified its quarterly report of September 1881,

showing a fictitious profit of 34 million francs. On January 5, the first cash price of a
share was 3040 francs, with the forward price hovering between 3020 and 3060 for the
upcoming settlement. The cumulative bad news brought both prices down to 2800 francs
by January 14.
A crisis loomed for the upcoming settlement on January 15, 1882 on the smaller
Lyon Bourse where many of the new intermediaries had opened. The structure of the 20
broker Lyon Bourse was similar to the much larger Paris exchange, where a common
fund also guarded against counterparty risk. Given that the promotion of many new
speculative issues financing development in the Balkans was centered in Lyon, numerous
clients in the forward market were trapped by the fall in share prices. Unable to settle the
contracts of ruined investors, brokers’ liabilities mounted, and the Lyon chamber
syndicale decided that the exchange should cease operations on the evening of January
19; the agents closed their books on the twentieth and sought out assistance in Paris.

V. Crisis on the Paris Bourse
The crisis gained speed after the mid-January 1882 settlement. When, on January
18, the Banque de Lyon was hit by a run and closed its doors, the cash and forward prices
of Union Générale, which had drifted down to 2390 and 2400 francs, collapsed to 1400
and 1300. Although Bontoux desperately tried to save the bank with an infusion of new
capital, it was shut down on January 30. On that day, the cash and forward prices of
Union Générale stood at 500 and 600 francs on the Paris bourse. In February 1882,

21

Union Générale went into bankruptcy.27 The whole market was convulsed by the news of
its falling share prices. Overall, the Paris market, as represented by the index in Figure 3,
fell 7.3 percent from December 1881 to the end of January 1882.
Many of the speculators in the forward market for Union Générale and other
securities were unable or unwilling to cover their rapidly growing losses as the end-ofJanuary settlement approached.28 Vidal (1910) reported that “many persons occupying a
certain social standing did not hesitate to refuse to meet their obligations” as the law
permitted a plea of gambling to avoid payment of a forward contract. As the exchange
and its brokers were obliged to carry out the orders placed with them, a wider crisis
loomed.
The key question that beset both the Paris and Lyon exchanges was what would
be the end-of-month settlement price.

Typically, this rate was set by the chambre

syndicale on the first day of settlement, using the cash price on the first day of the month.
It was the mandated price for reports and exchanges between agents, permitting
clearance without the transfer of money and certificates.

The settlement price was

passionately discussed. Would the settlement price be the price of securities before or
after the collapse of the market? The reporteurs, the bankers, and the bears demanded
that the use of the February 2 price. The reportés and the bulls wanted to use the prices
on January 19 when the Lyon brokers shut down their market. The higher the price, the
smaller the loss they faced---and the differences were staggering. A purchaser of a
forward contract of Union Générale on January 17 promised to pay 2400 francs a share at
the end of the month. The prospect of reselling at the January 19 cash price of 1300

27

Although he had engaged in fraud, Bontoux’s enterprises were grounded in the development of the
Balkan railroads; in bankruptcy, his enterprises eventually paid out over 80 percent of their liabilities After
the crash, the Comptoir d’Escompte de Paris picked up the pieces, and the Vienna-Constantinople line via
Belgrade opened in 1888. (Bouvier (1960), p. 104, p. 229). In March 1883, the Cour d’Appel de Paris
condemned Bontoux to five years in prison for fraud. While on appeal, Bontoux fled France. (Bouvier,
(1960), pp. 214-218). Bontoux claimed that the Jewish and Freemason bankers wanted to see him fail.
His defenders claimed that he was a victim of a “syndicat à la baisse” a bear pool run by the Jewish
bankers, Crédit Lyonnais, and the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. The press on the right took up
Bontoux’s claim that Jewish finance and freemasons in the government had conspired to bring down
Union Générale. This idea gained wide currency. See Emile Zola’s novel L’Argent (1890) and Ferguson
(1999, pp. 262-263.).
28
The financial community denounced investors who walked away from their contracts; and on February 8,
1882, the Paris Chambre de Commerce passed a resolution calling for the government to change the law.
(Vidal, 1910, pp. 211-214).

francs was painful, but it would be worse if the February 2 cash price of 400 francs was
the settlement price. Although the bulls lobbied hard for high prices, neither François
Allain-Targé, the Finance Minister nor his successor, Léon Say, supported them; and the
Paris Bourse chose the February 2 price of 400 francs for its settlement price (Bouvier,
1960). At the same time, the Treasury was unable to withdraw its 53 million francs in the
reports without precipitating further collapse and so raised its stake to 65 million francs
by the end of January, which was then increased to 165 million francs for the February
settlement.29
Meanwhile, the question of how to finance the upcoming settlement loomed.
Many customers and certainly some brokers would not be able to honor their
commitments, upsetting an orderly settlement. The common fund could not cope with
systemic risk. The crash of 1882 was a shock so large that it exhausted the fund’s capital
and immediate additional assessments would have been insufficient to permit the market
to continue to function.30 To meet this crisis, the Compagnie held an emergency General
Meeting on January 25 and gave the syndic the power to contract an 80 million franc
loan. With the approval of the government, the Bourse obtained credit from the Bank of
France, intermediated by private bankers and financial institutions because the Bank
could only provide a loan upon collateral of bankable paper that the brokers did not
possess. The chambre syndicale created 160 ten-year bonds of 500,000 francs carrying 5
percent interest. In turn, the bankers would receive these bonds and issue three-name,
three-month paper that could be discounted at the Bank of France. The solution was for
the Bank of France to manage the systemic risk by becoming the “insurer of last resort”
(Bernanke, 1990).
On January 30, 1882, this operation was carried out and the Compagnie des
Agents de Change borrowed 80 million francs to ensure that its members’ obligations
were honored, thereby preventing “an immense disaster that could upset all of Europe’s

29

Given his free market principles, Finance Minister Say (1886) went to great lengths to justify his actions.
By March, the Treasury was able to cut its funding of reports by half, finally ending this operation in July
1882.
30
Unlike private insurers, the Bourse could not exclude systemic shocks by setting some limit on the
common fund’s guarantee because falling prices might provoke a more rapid collapse when the market
approached the limit.

23

financial equilibrium.”31 On the first day of the end-of-month January settlement, 14
agents asked for assistance.

All totaled 66,800,000 francs were requested, leaving

12,000,000 left from the loan. Combined with the remaining 7 million from the Common
Fund, there were only 19 million francs left for the second day of the settlement. This
sum did not suffice and the syndic obtained a second 18 million loan from the
Rothschilds. Once the liquidity crisis was overcome, this loan and 50 million francs of
the 80 million were quickly repaid.32 The syndic, Ferdinand Louis Moreau expressed his
hopes that the remaining eight indebted brokers would soon be able to repay the advances
they had received (Compte rendu, 1882). In a letter of July 28, 1882, he reported that the
debt now stood at 29,250,000 francs. Moreau found this indebtedness humiliating and
begged the members to consider raising 350,000 francs each for the common fund from
their own pockets and those of their partners.
While the Paris stock brokers were bailed out, no such aid was forthcoming for
Lyon and many coulissiers suspended operations. A delegation of Lyon’s financial elite
pleaded for relief with the Bank of France, the Minister of Finance, leading bankers, and
the President of the Republic.

But, they were told that the government would not

“intervene in private calamities” (Bouvier, 1960, p. 193).

This hesitancy probably

reflected the political leanings of the center-left government, which had little interest in
assisting the conservatives of Lyon. Furthermore, although Lyon’s collapse had been
precipitated by the same events, Paris, the center of the nation’s financial markets, could
be aided independently of Lyon. The situation of the Lyon brokers was desperate; there
were enormous inter-broker debts and debts between brokers and their clients. The net
debt of the brokers was 63.7 million francs alone; the combined total reached 191
31

The bankers consortium contributed the 80 million francs accordingly: the Rothschilds 10 million and 2
million each from Heine, Gunzburg, Stern, Hensels, Camonds Vernes, Cohen, De Machy et Silliere,
Gillet, Hottinguer, Marnard , and Mallet frères. One million francs was provided each by Hannadex,
Péreire frères, Mirabad, and Donon, Alberti. Five million were provided by Crédit Foncier, the Comptoir
d’Escompte, the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas, Société Générale, Crédit Lyonnais, and the Banque
d’Escompte; 3 million from the Société de Crédit, 2.5 million from the Société de Depots et Comptes
Courants, and 1 million each from the Banque Hypothecaire, Crédit Mobilier, Crédit Moblier Espagnol, the
Banque Ottomane, the Banque Franco-Egyptienne, Crédit General Francais, and the Banque de
Constantinople (Compte rendu, 1882). The curb market in Paris was also provided with aid from the
leading banks of approximately 20 million in advances to the leading firms. According to Bouvier (1960), a
total of 175 million francs was required in Paris (including the loans to the brokers of the Bourse and the
Coulisse) in order to finance the reports.

million. In the absence of any aid, the Tribunal de Commerce announced the liquidation
of the exchange on January 28. Nine of the twenty brokers on the Lyon bourse proved to
be insolvent. A new Lyon chambre syndicale was created with a new syndic on May 13,
1882, but by July 6, only 16 brokers had joined the revived exchange.33
VI. Why Paris? Why 1882?
Why did the Paris Bourse nearly fail in 1882 and not in other stock market
crashes?

Why did the contemporary New York and London stock markets not

experience similar calamities? A definitive answer to these questions is not yet feasible,
but a few comparisons provide some useful insights for these questions. There are five
possible contributing factors: (1) the absence of legal standing for time contracts, (2) the
importance of the forward markets, (3) the size of the crash, (4) the concentration of
trading among brokers, and (5) moral hazard, arising from the operation of the common
fund.
Although French contemporaries stressed the lack of legal standing for forward
contracts as an important factor contributing to the crash, the legal status of time
contracts was similar in France, Britain and the United States for much of the nineteenth
century. In Britain, Barnard’s Act of 1734 prohibited time contracts, including options
and forward contracts, imposing stiff fines on the traders and brokers (Banner, 1998).
These contracts were void and denied legal recourse, but Barnard’s Act did not appear to
severely hinder this market. By the early nineteenth century, it was generally conceded
that Barnard’s Act was ineffective; and it was repealed in 1860 (Banner, 1998). In 1792,
New York State adopted a law based on Barnard’s Act. Contracts to sell debt or stock
that one did not own at the time of the contract were declared void and unenforceable in
state courts. Banner (1998) considers New York’s law to have been weaker than its
British model because it did not explicitly prohibit options or the settling of forward
contracts by payment of price differentials, and it imposed no fines beyond refunding the
money from the voided contract.

Nevertheless, as in Britain and France, markets for

time contracts flourished. The New York law was repealed in 1858, long after it was
recognized to have had little success in suppressing time contracts. While legal status had

25

been granted to these contracts in Britain and New York a quarter century ahead of
France, they were not a source of disaster for the Anglo-American markets hit by crashes
when laws were similar to French statutes.
Although the forward market may have been more important in Paris compared to
London or New York, we have few measures of the relative importance of time contracts
on any exchange in the nineteenth century.

Yet, the scanty evidence suggests that time

contracts were a significant portion of the business on the Anglo-American exchanges.
One well respected early nineteenth century observer, George Carey (1821) estimated
that “time-speculations” in London exceeded cash transactions by a factor of ten. On the
New York Stock and Exchange Board, Werner and Smith (1991) estimated that time
contracts constituted at minimum 20% of the transactions between 1818 and 1840.
This evidence on the first two factors makes it more difficult to argue that the
dominance of the forward markets and the absence of legal standing for time contracts
were exceptional features of the French market and placed it at special risk. Yet, it was
only in Paris, not New York or London, where the exchange felt obliged to set up a
common fund when the legal regimes were similar in all countries.34 New York and
London were still concerned about the problem of counterparty risk, but used more
limited regulation to manage it.

A substantial part of the minutes of the General

Committee of the London Stock Exchange in the nineteenth century were devoted to
questions of how to discipline defaulting members.

For London, higher admission

standards, expulsion of defaulting members and increased security bonds appear to have
been adequate remedies (Neal, 2004; Neal and Davis, 2006). Similarly, New York
expelled defaulting members. Expulsion of a small number of the one or two thousand
brokers from an idiosyncratic shock did not disrupt the operations of the exchange,
though there would have been losses for individual brokers in the absence of insurance.
Systemic shocks---stock market plunges---do not appear to have caused enough broker
failures to threaten the existence of these Anglo-American exchanges. Neither New York

34

The competitor of the Bourse de Paris, the Coulisse had counterparty risk from its use of forward
contracts but no common fund. Its absence may be explained by the fact that the Coulisse in this period
had no real corporate entity and the legality of its activity in the market was frequently contested, making it
difficult for the coulissiers to organize a fund and monitor one another.

26

nor London felt the imperative to mutualize the risk and provide an insurance fund for
their brokers.
The size of a shock could have been critical. The ability of brokers to weather a
large shock depended on the margin they had demanded from their customers, their own
capital and the distribution of defaulting customers. One possibility is that the French
agents de change were caught up in a speculative bubble and failed to raise margin and
capital sufficiently to cover the potential risk of a crash. The general magnitude of the
shock in 1882 was large but certainly not the greatest monthly drop in the market.
According to Arbulu’s index of stocks on the Bourse, the January 1882 drop in the
market of 7.3% was only the eleventh largest decline since 1800.

If one includes the

period up and including 1914, January 1882 falls to twenty-first place. The top two
crashes were 48.4% in March 1848 and 13.9% in April 1859; both of which the Bourse
weathered. In twentieth century U.S., there were two crashes before the establishment of
the Federal Reserve (Mishkin and White, 2003). During the 1903 crash, the Dow Jones
index fell 8.2% in October 1903. Then in the more severe crash of 1907, the index fell
9.7% in March, 8.2% in August and 11.3% and 10.9% in October and November of the
year. The crash of 1929 sent the Dow Jones tumbling 24% in two days October 28-29,
although the Federal Reserve, now in operation, intervened to ensure that banks provided
assistance to brokers (White, 2000).
The size of the shock does not seem related to the number of failing brokers in
this limited comparison. The seven Parisian agents de change who failed as a result of
the crash, represented 12% of the members.

On the New York Stock Exchange,

insolvencies were relatively minor events, even during the worst panics. Although there
are no published statistics for insolvencies during the nineteenth century, the percentage
of failing NYSE members ranged between zero and 1.23% for the period 1900-1933
(NYSE Yearbooks and www.nyse.org). Thus, during the panic of 1903, when there were
1,100 members of the exchange, 10 failed in 1903 and 6 in 1904. The more severe panic
of 1907-1908 brought down 8 members in 1907 and 9 members in 1908. Even the stock
market crash of 1929 and extraordinarily volatile years of 1929-1933, only caused 9, 10,
16, 4, and 2 member insolvencies with 1,375 members.

The American crashes of 1907

and 1929 are regarded as the end of speculative bubbles; yet broker failures were

27

minimal, perhaps because NYSE brokers were not sanguine about the boom (White,
2006). On the London exchange, the number of failures ranged from 10 to 49 brokers
between 1879 and 1899, representing at its peak 2% of members in 1894. Additional
protection to counterparties was provided by the surety bonds posted by each of three
recommenders for every member. Bonds were increased from £300 to £500 in 1872 and
to £750 in 1874 after the crisis of 1873, only to be lowered in 1879 (Neal and Davis,
2006), apparently containing the risk to the exchange.
The need to control counterparty risk may have been especially high on the Paris
exchange because counterparty risk is higher when a broker’s trades are highly
concentrated with a small number of counterparties, and brokers’ activities are not fully
diversified.35 A high degree of interdependence among brokers could trigger a cascade of
defaults on settlement day. The contrast between exchanges of this period is striking.
While the Bourse de Paris had sixty agents de change in 1880, the New York Stock
Exchange had 1,100 seats and the London Stock Exchange had just under 2,000
members. Although members on the London and New York exchanges were certainly
less well-known to one another than their peers in Paris, creating potential monitoring
problems, the magnitude of counterparty risk was apparently, relatively small. A default
by one broker on the New York or London exchange would have been unlikely to
bankrupt other brokers because their trades were more likely to be widely distributed.
But on the Paris exchange, the failure of one agent de change might more easily have
produced a liquidity crisis.
Perhaps, French brokers were more caught up in the boom market than their
British or American counterparts. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the capital of
Anglo-American brokers; but there is some evidence that the agents de change failed to
adequately raise their capital in the course of the stock market boom.

Scattered

statements on brokers’ capital suggest that it ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 million francs and
changed little in the boom years of 1880 and especially 1881. Volume, as measured by
the exchange’s stamp taxes had shown little upward movement until the boom. As seen
35

Jarrow and Yu (2001) model the pricing of counterparty risk for securities using a double poisson
process with jump terms to capture the inter-firm linkages. They find that in the limit, as firms hold welldiversified credit risk portfolios, the counterparty risk part of their default intensities (the likelihood of
default per unit of time) declines and disappears.

28

in Table 1, revenues peaked in 1872 and 1875 at 4.3 million francs (a sum only reached
once before in 1860), declining to 3.1 million in 1877 and then rising to 3.8 million in
1879 and 1880. In the boom, revenues from the stamp taxes jumped to 6.2 million francs
for 1881. For this fifty percent increase in the previous peak of transactions, there was no
noticeable increase in brokers’ capital.
Crashes are rare events, and brokers may have given careful consideration and
determined that they did not need to raise their capital or they may have believed the
overly-optimistic predictions for the market and were carried away by “irrational
exuberance.”

In addition, the caisse commune might have given them a false sense of

security since it had never failed them before. The incentives to morally hazardous
behavior may have increased during the boom. The rise in the common fund’s annual
reimbursement from 4 million francs in 1880 to 6 million francs in 1881, as the market
boomed, suggests that they perceived little increase in risk. The lure of higher returns
could have induced more risk-taking by the brokers, considering only idiosyncratic rather
systemic risks. Thus, brokers may not have had enough capital in their partnerships to
cover potential losses from a crash.

In New York or London, brokers may have been

more cautious because there was no protection from counterparty risk. A concentration
of trades between specific brokers, perhaps a larger forward market, a boom where
capital was not increased as the risk of a crash rose, and moral hazard from a mutual
guarantee fund appear to be important elements explaining why the crash of 1882 almost
closed the Bourse de Paris.

VII. The Clean Up in Paris
After the end-of-January settlement, the Paris Bourse had survived but seven
brokers ultimately lost their offices and the exchange was deeply in debt. Details in the
archives about the factors behind of the demise of the agents de change are sketchy.
While the personal dossiers of most brokers are generally complete, all brokers’ twice
yearly reports of income for the years of the crash are missing. This material appears to
have been removed at the time of the crisis, as a lawsuit soon after the crisis indicated

29

there were no relevant documents present. The dossiers of the individual brokers who
failed were apparently “cleaned up,” but they still provide some evidence.
Four brokers immediately failed as a result of the crash and they formally gave up
their offices on the same date, March 29, 1882.

They were Paul-Edmond Mahou who

had been an agent de change since 1854, Augustin LeGrand who started in 1868, DenisPaul-Alfred Sucède who took office in 1873 and Albert-Marie-Henri Ramel who joined
the bourse in 1865. Two additional agents gave up their office on April 24, 1882,
Phillippe-Adolphe Evrard (1868) and Marie-Philippe-Adolphe Tollin (1870).

These

departures and that of Leon-Edouard Lehoux (1862) who left office on May 29, 1882
also appear to have failed as a consequence of the crash.
Typical of the empty dossiers is the one for Mahou. He was deeply involved in
the speculative ventures that had been launched in Lyon, notably the Banque de Lyon.
Unfortunately, Mahou’s dossier does not allow us to reconstruct his demise as most
material for the period is missing. His only income reports are for 1863. Sucède’s dossier
has more information about his efforts to repay his debts. Reports of income indicate that
his brokerage, operated with a staff of about 18, was quite profitable up to the crash.
Except for a bad second semester in 1875, brokerage fees yielded the partnership
earnings of roughly 260,000 a year on a capital of 2,225,000, of which he had contributed
1,001,250 francs.36 In his dossier, there is an undated draft of an agreement between the
syndic and Sucède on how to resolve his debt. He owed the common fund 537,946 francs
on February 1882 and proposed to extinguish this debt with a cash payment of 200,000
francs and a transfer of the ownership of 12,000 francs of 3 percent rentes (nominally
worth 400,000 francs).37 Yet, these and the payments of other brokers to the common
fund were very slow in arriving.
By July 1882, 29.3 million of 80 million franc loan remained to be paid. If they
stayed in debt, brokers feared for the future of their monopoly, which was criticized by
many politicians. How could the brokers who were collectively responsible quickly pay
off this debt?

There was considerable disagreement because the brokers were a

Two of his partners were Isacc and Eugène Péreire who contributed 333,750 and 445,000 francs, in
addition to a M. Guastalla who provided 445, 000.

30

heterogeneous group; some remained strong after the crash while others were nearly
ruined. In the meeting of the chambre syndicale on October 13, 1882, the syndic Moreau
offered several choices.38 The Compagnie could obtain a long-term loan and slowly pay it
off, but this was felt to be politically undesirable. Alternatively, the brokers would have
to raise the money themselves. They argued over whether they would each have to pay
an equal amount or figure out some way to allocate it proportionally. They settled on a
fixed contribution of 300,000 francs for each of the sixty brokers.39 This raised 18
million francs, which combined with the 8.7 million francs left in the common fund, just
covered the repayment of the bank consortium’s loan. This internal loan of 27.4 million
francs appears in 1882 in Table 2 as advances to brokers; and when combined with cash,
rentes, and reports of 2.3 million, yielded assets of 29.7 million francs for the common
fund. The jump in the size of the caisse commune, seen in Figure 2, did not imply a
greater level of safety for the Bourse, which is represented by the “net” common fund.
The mid-1880s were lean times for the brokers, a stunning reversal of their earlier
prosperity. When the General Assembly met on the eve of the crash, on December 19,
1881, they basked in their good fortune. Revenues for the Compagnie had jumped from
5.0 to 7.5 million francs. Even though trades of government securities had declined,
surging volume had raised receipts from the stamp tax and the reports. The brokers did
take some precaution, creating a new secondary reserve to bolster the common fund.
Yet, they confidently raised their rebates from a total of 3,960,000 francs in 1880 to a
round 6,000,000 in 1881.
The crisis crushed the Bourse; there would be no rebates. As volume fell after the
crash, revenues to the Compagnie plummeted. Even though they were offset some by the
temporary increase in interest on reports, income was down to 6.2 million francs and
expenses rose to 2.9 million francs because of interest of the its loans. The caisse
commune had only 2.3 million to meet any new crisis. The whole of the surplus of 3.2
million francs for 1882 had to be transferred to the amortization account to begin the
process of accumulating the funds needed to pay off the internal loan.

with business. Many others appear to have renegotiated their contracts with unhappy partners.

31

The crash also took its toll on the officers and brokers. The syndic Moreau retired
immediately after seeing the Bourse through the crisis and was succeeded by August
Fernando Hart. He had been a broker on the exchange since 1853 and the syndic for 21
years. He was careworn and died shortly thereafter.40 The value of the Bourse as
financial institution was impaired and openly questioned in Parliament. Even though, the
chambre syndicale was resistant to allow a drop in the price of brokers’ offices, it
lowered the quoted price for an office from 1.8 in January 1882 to 1.7 million francs in
February 1882, as seen in Figure 4.
In 1883 and 1884, the revenues of the Compagnie continued to decline as the
stamp tax fell with volume, and expenses remained high because of interest costs, legal
fees and publicity. In addition to lower revenues, collection of debts proved difficult.
The syndic reported that the Compagnie was not treated the same as other debtors of
Union Générale.41 Even the welcome 1885 law, legalizing the forward market, met with
complaints because it did not do so retroactively, preventing the chambre syndicale from
going after defaulting clients.42 In 1884, the collections of debts in addition to ordinary
revenues permitted the reconstitution of the brokers’ 6 million francs security bond in the
common fund and the reimbursement of three million of the brokers’ 18 million franc
loan.43
By 1887, revenues had recovered to 6.6 million, producing a surplus of 4.6
million.

The Common Fund reached 26.8 million francs, of which amortization

accounted for 20.6 million, approaching the 22.5 million francs loans outstanding to
brokers.44 In 1888, there were no reported collections of the stamp tax in the first half of
the year; however, it appears that the chamber syndicale decided to directly grant 50,000
francs to each agent, which would represent 3 million francs in revenue from the stamp
tax. Finally in 1889, the accumulated surplus in the amortization fund permitted the
repayment of the internal loan and left the common fund recapitalized with 9.5 million

The 18 million franc loan was “added” to the bonds of the brokers, so that instead of being recorded as 6

The syndic Hart commented that the “this felicitous result of the complete

amortization of the account for loans to brokers has allowed the rebates of the stamp
taxes to begin.” In a patriotic metaphor, recalling the departure of occupying troops after
the Franco-Prussian war and the payment of reparations, he considered the repayment a
solemn date for the Compagnie when she could celebrate the “liberation of her territory.”
The annual report for 1890 showed a surplus of 3.6 million, allowing the
secondary reserves of the Common Fund to rise to 10.6 million francs, well above the
pre-crisis level. Rebates could begin once again after an interval of nine years. The
common fund continued to modestly increase until 1893 when a decline in revenues
coupled with high expenditure caused it to fall.45 In spite of the disaster in 1882, the
brokers did not allow the surplus to build up a greater cushion.

In fact, from 1894 to

1897, the secondary reserve was allowed to slowly shrink. The last substantial increase
in the common fund came from the security bonds of the ten new brokers, adding 10
million francs in 1899. There was no recorded discussion of these issues; however, the
brokers may have resisted any increase in the tax to support the common fund as they
struggled to compete with the Coulisse, and the indirect loan from the Bank of France
may have created a moral hazard, reducing their concerns about counterparty risk.
VIII. Long-Term Consequences for the Bourse
The Bourse’s near collapse in 1882 did not, however, lead to reform, in spite of
political pressure for change from some radical deputies and the press and competition
from the Coulisse.

In February 1882, a bill was proposed to abolish the Bourse’s

monopoly and allow free entry into stock broking. The bill failed to gain any traction,
and the only significant reform to emerge from the events of 1882 was the 1885
legalization of the forward market, which while it reduced some of the counterparty risk,
did not eliminate it.
The need to repay its debt weakened the exchange in its competition with the
Coulisse. Some curb brokers failed; but the survivors did not bear the burden of repaying
collective debts, as did the agents de change. The recovery of the stock market did not
restore the pre-eminence of the Bourse. The agents de change and their clerks were fixed

in number, requiring a network of financial institutions, bankers, and remisiers to
transmit orders to the brokers. The Coulisse was free to expand and traded more new
securities, becoming the dominant market. Comparative data on volume is not available
until the introduction, in 1893, of a tax on transactions. For the years 1893-1895, the
Ministry of Finance reported that the agents de change of Paris paid 11.8 million francs
in tax, the bourses in other cities 1.7 million francs, and the coulissiers and banks 22.1
million francs.46 The Paris Bourse’s low share seems to reflect a stagnation of activity on
the exchange. As measured by the stamp tax contributed to the common fund in Table 1,
volume on the Bourse remained relatively low after the clean up from the crash. Thus, it
is not surprising that the value of the office of an agent de change declined.

The year

1882 marked the peak price for the Paris brokers, and implicitly the value of the
exchange as an institution. Figure 4 shows that, although the chambre syndicale tried to
maintain high office prices and resisted lowering them, prices only moved downwards in
spite of a booming market for securities in the 1890s.
A strange twist of fate reinvigorated the unreformed Paris Bourse. The next
market crash did not hit the parquet but the Coulisse. Beginning in 1894, a boom began
in South African gold mining stocks, following their immense popularity on the London
exchange. These new foreign mining shares were listed by the Coulisse. By the end of
1895, there were 66 new gold, coal and colonial exploration companies added to the
Coulisse’s cash market and 32 to its forward market. The boom was also facilitated by
falling interest rates as seen in Figure 5. The failure in January 1896 of the Jameson raid
to provoke a British takeover of the Transvaal Republic produced a crash in gold stocks.
As the Bourse, whose share index declined a scant one percent, had been excluded from
this market, the Coulisse, where these stocks had been vigorously promoted, was held to
be responsible.47 Unlike 1882, the Bank of France did not intervene, its discount rate
remained unchanged, and coulissiers were allowed to fail. No general liquidity crisis, as
evident in the absence of any interest rate spikes in Figure 5.48

by Vidal (1910), p.233.

According to Arbulu’s index (1998), the maximum decline for the Bourse’s stocks was 1.2 percent over
the period October 1895 to March 1896.

The only intervening crisis arose from the failure of the Comptoir d’Escompte in 1888. The Banque de
France raised the discount rate and acted as a lender of last resort.

The crash politically undermined the Coulisse, leading to a reorganization of the
securities markets, which reinforced the position of the Bourse.

The Compagnie des

Agents de Change deftly supported the pro-tariff and bimetallist interests and gained the
government’s support. The Coulisse also suffered from attacks by the anti-Dreyfus, antiSemitic nationalist press as many of the curb brokers were not native-born Frenchmen
and included many Jews. The law of April 13, 1898 established the “solidarity” of the
agents de change and formally required the chambre syndicale to execute the trades of a
defaulting broker. The capacity of the Bourse was increased by raising the number of
brokers to 70, and the maximum number of head clerks for a broker was upped from four
to six. The Coulisse was blamed for stock swindles, tax frauds, and bear raids on the
French rentes and Russian bonds.

In response, Parliament reinforced the Bourse’s

monopoly. Trading by the Coulisse in listed securities was proscribed, limiting the curb
brokers to trading in the rentes and unlisted securities. Although the brokerage rates were
lowered in 1898, a new law in 1901 raised them for the strengthened monopoly.
Defeated, the coulissiers formed two syndicats one for the cash and the other for the
forward market; and in 1901 a modus vivendi was established between the Compagnie
and the two syndicats, permitting the coulissiers to act as remisiers to the parquet in
addition to trading unlisted stocks and the rentes.49
The Paris Bourse just avoided a complete collapse in 1882. The general decline
in the market ruined many traders and, in turn, destroyed some brokers, weakening the
rest. Not only was the margin demanded of clients insufficient to cover losses from the
crash, but the common fund was exhausted and no quick assessment of the solvent
brokers was possible.

Thus the worst case scenario for contemporary futures markets

was played out on Europe’s second largest exchange in 1882. Fortunately, the Bank of
France recognized the danger of an expanding liquidity crisis and step in to provide credit
to the market, acting appropriately as the “insurer of last resort.” The Bank of France
was careful to distinguish this shock as a systemic one, compared to the crash of the gold
stocks, where losses did not threaten the liquidity of the financial system and hence did
not require intervention. Its prompt action in 1882 may have limited contagion from the
crash, explaining why it did not reverberate more strongly beyond France’s borders.
