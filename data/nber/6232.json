    "abstract": "\n\nOne of the motivations for NAFTA from the US point of view was to reduce the\" incentives for Mexican migration into the US.  Unskilled rural males are a primary source of\" illegal immigration and also Mexico's relatively abundant factor. This group should therefore\" be made better off by trade and investment liberalization according to the traditional\" Heckscher-Ohlin model.  Existing evidence, along with best guesses of many experts in the\" area, suggest that NAFTA is unlikely to have a significant positive impact on this group least not within the time frame of several decades.  We draw on a number of recent theoretical\" contributions in order to offer reasons why NAFTA may not raise the wages of unskilled\" Mexican workers.\n\n",
