This paper analyzes

the relationship between patenting and research

and development activity at the firm level by the U. S. manufacturing
sector during the 1970's.

Previous work by Pakes and Griliches (1980).

which looked at a subset of the firms considered here, was the first
attempt to use the patenting and RID behavior of firms over time both to

control for individual firm effects and to try to learn something about
lags in the productivity of RID. The present study extends their sample to
1979 and covers almost all of the firms doing appreciable amounts of RID in
the manufacturing sector.

In attempting to characterize the lag structure

of the patents—RiD relationship, a number of econometric problems arising
from the panel nature of the data and from the measurement of the dependent

variable have to be solved or at least considered in interpreting the
results.

The basic model underlying this analysis has been described elsewhere
(Pakes and Griliches 1980, Hausman, Hall, and Griliches 1984) and will only

be Aketched here.

The annual research and development expenditures of a

firm are considered to be investments which add to a firm's stock of
knowledge

This stock of knowledge is depreciating over time so that the

contribution of older RID investment becomes less valuable as time passes.

fle aim of the study is to use patent applications in any given year as an
indicator of the "value" of the underlying stock of knowledge, and to infer

from the lag distribution on past RID something about gestation lags in

1

knowledge production. It is important to note at the outset that there are

difficulties with this approach:
only output of RtD —

the first is that patents are not the

they measure only a fraction of this output, and the

fraction may vary considerably over industry and possibly also over time.
Controlling for differences in the firms' propensity to patent (conditional

estimation) as well as including an overall effect for each year are
partial answers to this.

A second and related problem with the existing

data is that most of the information on the question will, come from
relative changes in the two variables over time within the firm; if these
changes are contaminated by measurement error or they are very small, the
lag structure will be extremely difficult to discern.

A third problem has to do with the economic value of the patents
themselves. Researchers such as Mansfield (1977) and Taylor and Silberston

(1973) have suggested that the existence of the patent system may be a
relatively unimportant factor in the research and development strategy of

some firms.

There is also a growing body of evidence (Grabowski 1983,

Pakes 1984, Schankerman and Pakes 1984) showing that a large fraction of
patents granted are 'worthless"
time.

or become worthless in a short period of

This paper has very little to say on this range of topics; we

observe the fact that firms do take out patents which are related to the
output of their research and development laboratories (and other activities

of the firm in the R*D area) and that therefore, patents can be used as an

indicator of this activity in the aggregate even though the information
conveyed by an individual patent may be very small.

In discussing an earlier version of this paper. Stoneman (1983) argued

strongly that patents are an input to the ReD process rather than an
output.

That is, the patent application occurs at an early point in the

development process and most of the expenditures that would be associated

2

with it occur after the application is made.

With this data we are in a

position to investigate this question of timing, and find that the evidence

for it is relatively weak, at least in aggregate firm behavior.

The

strongest thing one can say is that RSD and patents appear to be dominated
by a contemporaneous relationship, rather than leads or lags.

The earlier work in this area also found a

strong contemporaneous

effect of RtD on patents but was inconclusive as to whether there

was a

Fakes and Griliches, using the standard fixed

effects model, found evidence of a lag truncation effect in the distributed

lag of patents on ReD.

That is, when they controlled for permanent

differences across firms in the propensity to patent, the estimated
coefficient on the last lag of R*D which they considered (ken

expenditures

of four years prior) was significantly higher than the coefficients of more
recent RtD.

Hausman, Hall, and Griliches used a different functional form

(which took the discreteness of the patent data explicitly into account)
and found similar results for the random (uncorrelated) effects model but

not in their conditional fixed effects version.

When they conditioned

their estimates on the total number of patents received during the whole

period, no coefficients except for the contemporaneous RID variable were

statistically significant either in the Poisson or negative binomial
vers ion.

These previous studies both used samples of about 120 firms with seven

to eight years of patent data and twelve to thirteen years of RID data.
For the current study, although we have about fourteen years of patent data

from 1966 to 1979, we have only eight years of RID data for about 650
firms, with an additional two years (1970 and 1971) for half the firms.

This fact constrains our ability to look for

3

very long lag effects,

especially since we cannot distinguish easily between permanent differences

across firms in the propensity to patent and effects due to the

past RtD history.

unobserved

We discuss this issue at greater length in the body of

the paper.

The other problem we have to deal with is the specification of the error

term in our model. The difficulty arises from two somewhat related causes:

the presence of a large number of zeroes in our dependent variable, the
number of patents applied for by a firm in a particular year. and the large

size range of the firms in our sample. A previous paper (Bound et at 1984)

which analyzed a large cross section sample,

including the firms under

consideration here, demonstrated that estimates were quite sensitive to the

specification of the distribution of the error term.

Since most of the

estimators used were consistent, this can be construed as informal evidence
of misspecification of the underlying model,

possibly due to nonlinearity

in the relationship of log patents to log R*D or to heteroskedasticity

which is size—related.

We have taken two approaches in obtaining our

estimates in this paper:

the first uses a nonlinear least

squares

specification with additive errors; for these estimates we are able to

obtain robust standard errors which are correct in the presence of
arbitrary heteroskedasticity, including year—to—year correlation within
firms.

For this version of the model however, we are unable to obtain

conditional estimates, due to its intrinsic nonlinearity and the shortness
of

our

panel.

The second approach uses an explicit

specification for the patents variable, that it follows

stochaflic

a Poisson or

negative binomial distribution, which enables us to obtain conditional
estimates of the slope parameters, but at the price of a distributional
assumption which may not hold.

The plan of this paper is the following:

4

first we discuss the

derivation of our dataset and look at the properties of our independent
variable, R%D expenditures.

Then we present some estimates of the basic

patents—ReD relationship, followed by a discussion of the biases which may
be present in the cross section estimation of this relationship.

Finally

we present conditional estimates of our model in an attempt to control for
some of these biases and we conclude with a brief discussion of what we can
learn from these data.

S

I. Data

The data we use are an extract from a larger and longer panel of firms
in U.

S. manufacturing drawn from the Compustat (Standard and Poor 1980).

This dataset was assembled and combined with patent data form the Office of
Technology Assessment and Forecasting at the NBER and is described in Bound

et al (1984) and Cummins, Hall, and Laderman (1982). The original universe

from which our sample comes consisted of approximately 2700 firms in the

manufacturing sector in 1976, and included almost all of the firms which
report R%D expenditures to the Bureau of Census—NSF RtD survey.

Our sample of firms was chosen from this universe by

requiring that

data on sales, gross capital, market value (value of common stock), and R t

D be available for all years from 1972 through 1979 with no large jumps
during that period.

A jump is defined as an increase in capital stock or

employment of more than 100 per cent or a decrease of more than 50 per
cent.

This test was not applied unless the change in employment was

greater than 500 employees or the change in capital stock was greater than
two million dollars.

We also removed six fins which had abnormally small

K I D values (less than 110,000) in one of the years.

The number of firms

remaining in the sample after these cuts was 642, with a size distribution
heavily tilted toward the larger fins in our original universe.

Table 1

shows the selectivity of this sample with respect to size and indicates
that although we have only a quarter of our original sample of firms, most

of those lost were either smaller or were not K % D doing (and reporting)
firms.

Our coverage of the larger K t D firms is almost complete, and our

sample

includ!s 90 per cent of the RID dollars expended by

the

manufacturing sector in 1976.

Table 2 exhibits the characteristics of our remaining sample of firms,

both the 642 firms with R t D between 72 and 79 and a subset of firms with
a longer it * D history back to 1970.

Quantiles are shown in order to give

some indication of the skewness of the data: for example, median sales for

this sample in 1976 were 182 million dollars. while mean salel were 1.06
billion dollars. The subset of firms with a longer R*D history consists of

somewhat larger firms and is more heavily tilted toward
sector.

the scientific

Even for this sample of relatively RtD—intensiye firms, we find

that over 20 per cent of the firms did not apply for patents in 1976 and

that more than half applied for less than five.

This confirms our

impression that the patents variable in these data must be treated in a way
which

correctly reflects its relative imprecision at small values.

Previous experience with estimation of the patents equation in the cross

section (Bound et al 1984) has shown us that slope coefficient estimates
may not be robust to changes in the way in which we specify the error in
the equation (and the weighting which is implied by such specification).
In the later sections of this paper we look at this question again in an
effort both to. draw some robust conclusions from the data and to understand

the reasons for the unstable coefficients. However, first we take a cloSer
look at the process generating our independent variable, R*D. since the way

it evolves has important implications for our ability to identify the true
coefficients in the presence of lag truncation and firm effects.

To study the stochastic process for R*D,

we use a procedure due to

MaCurdy (1983) for computing the sample autocorrelation

The basic result is that the AR2 specification

is in fact very close to a random walk.

The last two columns of this table provides a partial answer to the
question of whether patents can be viewed as an input to theY RtD process in
this data.

We use a simple version of a Granger causality test: with two

lags of RID used to predict the current level of R1D, we include
contemporaneous and lagged log patents in the regression to see if they

help in predicting RID in the presence of its past history.

The

coefficient on contemporaneous log patents is significant (t=3.1), but

We should qualify this result by noting that there is a

considerably lower signal to noise ratio in the patents variable than in

earlier and because it is intrinsically an integer variable. This has been

II. Basic Results

In earlier work with the 1976 cross section of these firms, Bound et al

found that estimates of the elasticity of patenting with.respect to RID at

the average RID in the sample varied from 0.35 to 2. depending on the

choice of specification: log linear. Poisson, negative binomial, or
nonlinear least squares.

This difference was greatly attenuated when the

firms were divided into two groups, those with R 1 D budgets larger than
two million dollars and those with smaller R 1 0 budgets.

paper, the problem is not as severe since our sample

In the present

is more heavily

weighted toward the firms in the larger group (approximately 50 per cent

have R I D greater than two million, rather than 20 per cent), but it
still persists and affects our estimates of the: lag distribution.

In Table 'k

we look at the differences in estimates of our basic model

which are implied by differing specifications of the error structure.

The

model is

are the observed firm characteristics (size, as measured by the

log of gross plant in 1972, and a dummy for the scientific sector).

Our

sample is the 642 firms estimated over the years 1975 to 1979 so that we
can include three lags on RID, which yields a total of 3210 observations on

the dependent variable, patents.

The first column shows the nonlinear

least squares estimates of the parameters, which are obtained by assuming
an additive and homoskedastic error in equation (1).

These estimates are

consistent for the underlying coefficients, provided the model is correctly
specified.

The standard errors shown are robust to heteroskedasticity of

the disturbances; they are computed using the formulas due to Eicker—White—

10

Chamberlain, and allow both for differing variances across firms and
arbitrary serial correlation over time within firms.

The next two columns of Table 4 give the results of estimating the
Posson and negative binomial versions of our models.

The advantage of

these models is that they take into account the non—negativity and
discreteness of our data.

Moreover, in the next section of this paper we

will see that the conditional versions of these models allow us to estimate

a fixed effects model, something that we cannot do easily with the
nonlinear least squares version of the model.

On the other hand, these

models require us to be explicit about the exact form of the distribution
from which the disturbance is drawn, and may produce inconsistent estimates

if the distribution is not correct (Gourieroux. Montfort, and Trognon
1984).

The Poisson and negative binomial models were described in detail in our

earlier paper (Rausman, Hall, and Griliches 1984) and we shall summarize
only their main features here. The log likelihood function for the Poisson
model is given by

Estimates obtained with this model differ from the nonlinear least squares
estimates primarily by the weighting scheme used.

The NLS estimates are

unweighted, implicitly weighting the numerically larger deviations of the
larger firms more than those of the small firms. The Poisson model assumes
that the variance of the disturbances is proportional to the expected value

11

of the patents and weights the observations accordingly.

The negative

binomial model generalizes the Poisson model by allowing for an additional
source of variance above that due to pure sampling error. The logarithm of
the likelihood for this model is

formula for the variance of these estimates is given in GMT, and is a
special case of the Eicker—White—Chamberlain formula with known weights.
Since

all of these models differ only by their

distributional

assumptions and not by specification of the expected value, they should all

yield roughly the same results unless the basic specification of the
equation is wrong.

In fact,

it can be shown (see GMT) that both the NLS

estimates and the Poisson estimates of the parameters are consistent if we

have correctly specified the expectation in Cl) and the true conditional
distribution

satisfies certain regularity conditions given in their

article. Because the estimators make different assumptions about the error
structure they do yield different estimates of the standard errors, even in

the case of similar coefficients.

In this respect,

the nonlinear least

squares estimates, weighted or unweighted. are the most robust, since we
have computed standard errors which allow for unknown heteroskedasticity.
It can be seen from the table that in return for making a relatively mild

assumption about the form of the variance (that it is increasing in the
mean and mean squared), we obtain a considerable increase in the precision
of our estimates (compare columns 1 and 4).

In Table 4 we see that the results of using the four different
estimators on this dataset are qualitatively the same, although there is a

substantial increase in the coefficient on contemporaneous RtD as we move

from nonlinear least squares to weighted nonlinear least squares (GMT).

correct model, but are estimated with different weighting schemes.2 one

III. Correlated Effects or Lag Truncation Bias?

In obtaining the results shown in Table 4, there was no attempt to
control for permanent differences in the propensity to patent across firms,

except for the firm size variable and a dummy for the scientific sector.

We expect that these differences may bias our estimate of the RID
coefficients if they are correlated with the RID variables.

All of the

estimates, except possibly those for the smaller firms, exhibited evidence

of a u—shaped lag structure, with the first and last coefficients being
larger than those in the middle.

The large coefficient on the last lag

could be due to the correlation of the last R1D variable with earlier left—

out RID, but it turns out that under reasonable assumptions on the RID
process itself, it could also be caused by (correlated) fixed effects.

Assume that the log deflated RID variable itself follows a first order

maintain the hypothesis that RID follows an AR1 process, we can compute the

bias formula for the coefficients on RID in the presence of two types of

the same correlation with RID in all periods.

If y is close to one, as it appears to be in our

data, the bias for coefficients

To explore this idea further, we use a longer sample of firms which have
RtD data available back to 1970.

This leaves us with 346 firms, slightly

more than half of our original sample, and somewhat more heavily weighted
towards larger firms.

For this sample, we obtain estimates for a model

with five lags on ReD (shown in Table 5). For comparison, estimates of the

original model (with three lags) on this new sample are also shown,

It

appears from these results that some of the effect we observed in the last
lag was indeed due to truncation (note how the coefficient on R3 in column

1 is spread between H3, H4, and R5 in column 2) if we push the idea
further by estimating with seven lags on the last three years of data (1977

through 1979), the loading on the last lag seems to have disappeared.
However, we have also pushed the data beyond the point where it will yield

meaningful results, since significant instability in the RD coefficients
for adjacent years is now evident.

The tentative conclusion is that there

is unlikely to be a substantial effect of RtD more than seven years old on
the patent activity of firms in the manufacturing sector.

To examine the other alternative, a fixed effects explanation of the u—

shaped lag distribution, we hypothesize a differing propensity to patent
for each firm which is (possibly) correlated with its RtD activity.

The

reasoning in this section suggests that estimates conditional on the
permanent patenting :propensity of the firm should reduce both the first and

last lag coefficient if we have correlated effects and only the last one if

the problem is lag truncation (and the lag truncation is

relatively

constant from year to year). This leads us to look at models which are
conditional on the permanent R%D behavior of firms in the next section.

IV. Conditional Estimates

We take two different approaches to obtaining conditional estimates for

our model:

the first includes all observed values of MD (for a firm) in

each equation with the coefficients constrained to be equal across the
different years. This is an attempt to control for fixed effects which may

be correlated with our MD variables, since we cannot simply estimate the

effects due to the shortness of our panel and the nonlinearity of the
model.

The second approach imposes a specific distribution on the error

term, namely the negative binomial, allowing us to derive an estimator
which is conditional on the total number of patents applied for by the firm
in all the observed years.

This second approach was described in our earlier paper (Hausman, Hall,
and Griliches 1984); by conditioning on the total number of patents applied

for by the firm,

it essentially allows for a different intercept for each

Due to the multiplicative nature of the error in this model, this

translates into a different variance for each firm, so that the conditional

model estimates an overall variance parameter, but not the individual
intercepts or variances. The log likelihood for this model is

Table 6 gives the results of estimates obtained in both ways for both of

our samples of firms. The first two columns are estimates of the
conditional negative binomial model, while the last two are estimated using

weighted nonlinear least squares on equation (1), where the firm effect

18

includes all the R&D variables in all years. but with coefficients 8

constrained to be the same across the years.

These two methods of

estimation are both compromises of a different sort: the negative binomial

version allows for an arbitrary firm effect while making a specific
distributional assumption while the GMT version controls for a firm effect

correlated with R&D in a particular way (linear in the exponential
function) but does not impose a distribution on the error term.

It is

therefore reassuring that there are not huge differences between them.
The basic result is that none of the coefficients are significant except
those on current R&D. although the total effect of the lagged R&D does seem

to add about .05 to the coefficient on the sum,

It makes very little

difference whether we look at the 642 firm sample or the sample of 346
firms which has a longer R&D history.

From the fact that the coefficient

on contemporaneous R&D hardly changes from the unconditional estimates,
while that on the last R&D goes to zero we conclude that most of what we

have removed by conditioning is the R&D prior to our longest lag.

This

confirms the result of Table 5 where we saw a considerable smearing of the
lag coefficients when we used a longer lag in the unconditional estimates.

However, the coefficients are fairly unstable and the standard errors are
large, so the most we can say is that there appears to be a fairly strong
contemporaneous effect,

even when firm effects are controlled for.

Evidence for a contribution of lagged R&D to current patenting activity is
of the order of about 0.05 in the conditional estimates and possibly larger
in the unconditional.

Using an idea in Pakes and Griliches (1984), we can try to estimate more

lags in this equation by assuming that R&D follows a low order AR process.

in this case ARt.

Since this implies a correlation only between the last

included R&D and the presample R&D. the estimates of all coefficients

19

except the last will be unbiased by the omission of earlier flfl.
Accordingly, we leave the last coefficient free in each year of the
equation, which allows us to estimate six lags in the 1972—1979 sample and

eight lags in the 1970—1979 sample.

The precision of the estimates

declines with the length of the lag since we have fewer and

fewer

observations for the longer lags (lag six in the 1972—1979 sample is

estimated only from the 1979 equation, for example).

However, this

constraint allows us to use all but one of the years of data on patents for

each sample of firms, so that we have seven years in the 642 firms sample
and nine in the 346 firms sample.

We show these results in Table 7; they are essentially the same as the

conditional estimates in Table 6.

We also estimated this version of the

model including firm effects correlated with lttD;

these tuned out to be

insignificant (X2(7) = 3.9 for the first column and x219)=11.2 for the
second), although the model in this form is highly collinear so that it is
difficult to draw firm conclusions.

The basic message of the results in this section is that permanent
differences across firms in the propensity to patent do not appear to bias

our estimates of the distributed lag relationship between patenting and
RtD, except insofar as they are related to the presample history of RID.

The results of the previous section suggested that this bias, if it

existed, would appear of equal magnitude in the first and last lag
coefficients of RftD. This does not seem to be the case; what bias there is

seems only to affect the last lag, and is eliminated by modelling the

presample RID process itself.

This does not imply that there are no

differences in the propensity to patent across firms:

the size variable

and the scientific sector dummy are still significant in the final version

20

of the model.

Nor does it imply that all the differences are uncorrelated

with RIO. but only that the correlation which is observed can be
successfully explained by controlling for the part of the R&D history which
we do not observe.

21

V. Conclusion

What do we conclude from this lengthy exploration of a basically simple
model?

First, there does seem to be a rather strong contemporaneous

relationship between RftD expenditures and patenting, which does not
disappear when we control for the size of the firm, its permanent patenting

policy, or even the effects of its RtD history.

The remaining elasticity

appears to be about .3 with a fairly large standard error.

Second, the

contribution of the observed RiD history to the current year's patent
applications is quite small, on the order of .05. Third, the contribution
of the unobserved or presample RtD appears to be large, about .25. and is a

possible explanation of the existence of the observed differences across
the firms in the propensity to patent.

One of the most interesting results in this paper has nothing to say

about patenting, although it provides one reason why we have diffculty
measuring the relationship within firm over time:

the characterization of

the pattern of MD investment within a firm as essentially a random walk
with a relatively low error variance.

In other words, MD budgets over

this short horizon (8 years) are roughly constant or growing slightly (in

constant dollars) and therefore it is difficult to imagine that they are
very sensitive to patenting success or vice versa.
Finally, it is difficult to give a clear cut answer to the question this

paper was originally designed to answer: is there a significant longrun

effect of successful R*D investment for which patents can serve as an
indicator?

The evidence here indicates the longrun level of RtD can be

quite important, but the result is predicated on inference about the
There is very little direct evidence

unobserved part of the R*D process.

of anything but simultaneity in the year—to—year movements of patents and

22

RtD.

This finding suggests another way of looking at the process:

in

large industrial firms the fraction of RD expenditures devoted to
development rather than basic or applied research tends to be well over
fifty per cent (NSF 1982).

It seems reasonable to suppose that successful

research leads both to a patent application and to a committment of funds

for development.

A detailed investigation of this timing is beyond the

scope of annual data, but the strong evidence of simultaneity in patents
and R%D in our data conforms very well to this picture.

We should not close this paper on the usual note of the failure of the
data to live up to our econometric expertise. Even though we have not been

able to elucidate the RtD to patents lag structure better, our overall
findings

showing a

are quite interesting,

persistent

significant

contemporaneous relationship of RD and patenting and rather wide and semi-

permanent differences across firms in their patenting and RID policies.

The later finding provides the challenge for further research in a
different style: trying to understand how and why firms differ in their
responses to the technological environment they find themselves in.

1. Ideally we would like to perform this test also in the
other direction using patents on lagged patents and RID, but
there are difficulties in performing a comparable test due to the
discrete nature of the dependent variable already alluded to.

2. Another way to understand what the different estimators are
doing is to examine the first order conditions (again suppressing
the t subscript and writing e. for y1—exp(X.fl) ):

NLLS:

precisely what makes this estimator inconsistent when

the

distribution is not negative binomial, although the other three
estimators remain consistent in this case since they are all
version of weighted least squares.
Displaying the first order conditions in this way reveals that
the estimators only differ in their choice of weights, although

NLLS and GMT are minimum distance estimators, and Poisson and
negative binomial are maximum likelihood estimators.
They can
be ranked by the weight which tbey give to firms with larger X's,
