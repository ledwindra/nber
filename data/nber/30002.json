    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a satisficing model of choice in which the available alternatives differ in their inherent complexity. We assume\u2014and experimentally validate\u2014that complexity leads to errors in the perception of alternatives\u2019 values. The model yields sharp predictions about the effect of complexity on choice probabilities, some of which qualitatively contrast with those of maximization-based choice models. We confirm the predictions of the satisficing model\u2014and thus reject maximization\u2014in a novel data set with information on hundreds of millions of real-world chess moves by highly experienced players. These findings point to the importance of complexity and satisficing for decision making outside of the laboratory.\n\n",
