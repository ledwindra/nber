EU Accession and Foreign Owned Firms in Bulgaria

NBER Working Paper No. 21860
January 2016
JEL No. F15,F21,F23
ABSTRACT
Bulgaria signed the Europe Association Agreement (EAA) in 1995 and the European Union accession
treaty in 2005. Accession had the effect of increasing FDI in Bulgaria. We analyze World Bank BEEPS
firm level data for 2007 to better understand characteristics and performance of foreign firms in Bulgaria.
We estimate linear probability and logit models to determine the likelihood a firm is foreign in Bulgaria.
Regressions show foreign manufacturing firms in Bulgaria are larger than domestic firms, have lower
capital to labor ratios and are more likely to export. Foreign service sector firms are larger than domestic
firms, have lower capital to labor ratios, are more likely to export and to locate in Sofia, the capital.
Our analysis points to limited success of foreign firms in Bulgaria. Regressions show foreign manufacturing
firms do not have higher sales growth and made less capital investments than domestic firms. Foreign
firms in the service sector did not experience faster sales growth or had greater capital investments
than domestic firms. Institutional indicators show manufacturing and service sector firms with larger
fractions of exports relative to sales had a greater number of visits from tax officials. This suggests
that exporting firms receive larger scrutiny than other firms, which represents a challenge to foreign
firms in Bulgaria.

1. Bulgaria’s integration to the European Union
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, communist Eastern
European countries transitioned into market economies. One important part of this
transformation was the opening of trade between Eastern and Western Europe. Most
Eastern European countries signed preferential Trade Agreements with the European
Union (EU), and eventually joined the EU.
Eastern European countries transformed from command and control economies,
where most firms were government owned, to economies that responded to market
supply and demand forces. Laws allowing private ownership and integration to the EU
led to a significant growth in foreign owned firms through privatizations and
establishment of new enterprises.
In 1992 Bulgaria started negotiations with the European Community and became
an associate member of the EU by signing the Europe Association Agreement (EAA) in
1995. The EAA established free trade between a respective country and the EU through
gradual full elimination of barriers to trade in industrial goods and some liberalization of
trade in agricultural goods. In the case of Bulgaria, first EU eliminated all import duties
and non-tariff measures applied to Bulgarian exports of industrial products on January 1st
1998 and then Bulgaria eliminated all import duties and non-tariff measures on EU
exports of industrial goods on January 1st 2002.1
In 2005, Bulgaria signed an accession treaty, which came into force in January
2007. Bulgaria’s accession was part of the fifth enlargement of the EU, and was the first
1

The free trade area agreements within the European Union apply only to industrial
production and not to agricultural goods. There are additional reciprocal concessions for
some agricultural goods, such as tobacco, cheese and wine.
1

time the EU extended beyond the Iron Curtain. The first phase of the enlargement took
place in 2004 when Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta,
Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined. During the second phase Bulgaria and Romania
joined (Kalotay, 2008). FDI almost doubled following the signing of the accession treaty
(Sakali, 2013). FDI continued to increase in 2007 but the rate of growth of FDI declined
in subsequent years.
There has been limited research on the impact of the EU preferential trade
agreement and EU accession on the location, characteristics and performance of foreign
firms in Eastern Europe. In this paper, we analyze firm level data from the World Bank’s
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) 2007, to better
understand the characteristics and performance of foreign firms in Bulgaria at a transition
point, when Bulgaria was completing the EU accession treaty. We estimate linear
probability and logit models to determine characteristics of foreign firms in Bulgaria. We
analyze economic outcomes of foreign firms and institutional conditions that may play a
role in their performance.

2. Determinants of FDI and Foreign Firms in Bulgaria
The literature on the determinants of FDI is extensive. Blonigen (2005)
summarizes this literature into research that focuses on factors internal and external to the
firm. Factors internal to the firm include characteristics and price of capital and labor, and
intangible factors include technology and managerial skills. Factors external to the firm
include macroeconomic conditions, exchange rates, taxes, trade policy and institutions.
EU accession gave Bulgaria a location advantage by expanding the market size

2

firms were able to reach, by improving the availability of resources for infrastructure
development and by providing more political and legal stability. According to Bitzenis
and Vlachos (2013), FDI stock in Bulgaria doubled after EU accession. Four-fifth of the
foreign investment originated in countries from the EU.
The literature on Bulgaria’s integration to the EU and it’s impact on FDI has
focused on aggregate FDI inflows. Kalotay (2008) analyzed aggregate FDI inflows to
Bulgaria from 1994 to 2006 and finds that that despite lower labor costs and lower
corporate taxes, Bulgaria attracted relatively few efficiency seeking foreign investments,
mostly in garments and footwear industries. These industries are under a global
competitive threat and their growth prospects are limited.
Sakali (2013) analyzes bilateral FDI inflows from a panel of countries investing in
Bulgaria from 1996 to 2010 and finds that Bulgaria’s trade integration, secondary and
tertiary education and transition reforms increased FDI in Bulgaria. Bitzenis and Vlachos
(2013) also analyze FDI inflows to Bulgaria from 1999 to 2011 and find that the main
drivers of FDI in Bulgaria are the prospects of extra EU exports and the size of the
domestic market.
The literature has also focused on Bulgaria’s institutional framework and it’s
impact on foreign firms’ ability to do business. According to Bozhilova (2010), Bulgaria
and Romania were slower at adapting and applying open market rules when compared to
other countries that became part of the EU during the 5th enlargement. Moreover,
Bulgaria was the poorest country to join the EU during the 5th enlargement. Bitzenis and
Marangos (2008) surveyed 64 foreign firms on their views of the business environment in
Bulgaria. The authors find that 52% perceived Bulgarian business environment to be high

3

risk, primarily due to an unstable legal framework, large bureaucracy, corruption and
crime.
More research is needed on FDI in Bulgaria using micro level data to understand
the characteristics of foreign firms, their economic performance and their interaction with
institutions. Firm level data can help us better understand how EU accession has affected
foreign firms in Bulgaria.

3. Data Description
We use World Bank’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS) for Bulgaria, 2007. This is a stratified random sample of firms outside
agriculture in four major cities in Bulgaria: Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas (See Figure
1). These are the main cities in Bulgaria and major industrial clusters of the country.
They comprise 40% of the country’s population and 23% of the territory. The sample
includes all manufacturing sectors according to ISIC classifications Revision 3.1,
construction (group F), services (groups G and H), transport, storage and communications
(group I) and ISIC 72 Computer and Related Activities. The sample excludes financial
intermediation (group J), real estate and renting activities (group K). Data was collected
on 1,087 firms. Due to omitted variables, our sample includes 856 of those firms.
Additional data was collected from the World Trade Organization on European Union
most favored nations tariff rates by 3 digit level ISIC industry.

4. Methodology
We estimate the probability that a firm is foreign based on firm characteristics, EU tariffs,
and location of the firm.
We estimate the following probability model using OLS and logit regressions:

PForeignijk    1Kijk / Lijk   2 LogSalesijk  3 PExportsijk   4 DTariff j 

5 Sizeijk  Ind j  Sofiak   (1)
ijk

The subscript ijk refers to firm i in industry j and city k. Where Foreign is a dummy
variable that equals 1 if the firm is foreign and 0 if the firm is domestic. Capital/Labor is
the capital to labor ratio of the firm. LogSales is the natural log of sales of the firm in
2006. PExports is the percent of sales that is exported. DTariff is the difference between
average EU Tariff and Bulgarian Tariffs in 2006.2 The difference captures changes in
the tariff structure when Bulgaria joined the EU.3 Size is a series of dummy variables for
employment size of the firm. The employment categories are small, 0 to 49 employees,
medium, 50 to 249 employees and large, 250 and more employees. The omitted
employment category is small. Ind are industry dummies. There are 6 industry dummies,
three in manufacturing and three in the service sector. They are described in Table 1.
Sofia is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm is located in Sofia and  is a random
component, assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero. We estimated equation
(1) separately for manufacturing and service sector firms.
To compare the economic performance of domestic and foreign firms, we
estimate the following equation separately for manufacturing and service sector firms:

Bulgarian Tariffs were eliminated in 2007 and replaced with EU Tariffs.
Average EU and Bulgarian tariffs were estimated for the 3 digit level ISIC industry of
the firm.

Where DLogSalesijk is the difference in the natural log of sales of the firm from 2005 to
2006. Age is the years since the firm was initially established. Other variables in the
regression are the same as in equation (1). We also analyze other firm level economic
outcomes and institutional variables. One of them is capital investments in 2006, a
variable that equals 1 if the firm made capital investments in 2006 and 0 otherwise.
Another one is access to a credit line, which equals 1 if the firm has access to a credit line
and 0 otherwise. We also estimate regressions on time spent on government regulation
and number of times visited by Bulgarian tax officials during the year.
All regressions measuring economic outcomes and institutional framework faced
by firms in Bulgaria were estimated using OLS with the exception of number of times
visited by tax officials, which was estimated using Poisson regressions. All standard
errors were estimated using clustered standard errors, which were based on industry
affiliation.

5. FDI in Bulgaria
Figure 1 shows a map of Bulgaria, which includes markers on the four cities
included in the BEEPS survey: Sofia, the capital, Plovdiv, located in the center of the
country, Burgas and Varna located in the Black Sea coast.
Figure 2 shows net inflows of Foreign Direct Investment in Bulgaria from 1998 to
2014. It shows an increase in foreign direct investment starting in 2002, the year when
Bulgaria eliminated all import duties and non-tariff measures on EU exports of industrial
6

goods. Bulgaria’s inward FDI grew by approximately 50% from 2005 to 2006
immediately after the country signed the accession treaty. Inward FDI peaked in 2007,
the year of accession, and decreased in subsequent years. By 2010, net FDI inflows were
below the 2002 levels and had little improvement in subsequent years.
A comparison between FDI inflows in Bulgaria before and after accession to
those of the European Union suggest that FDI flows into Bulgaria were positively
affected by accession in 2007. The timing of FDI inflows in Bulgaria is different from
that of the European Union (28 countries), shown in figure 3.4 While Bulgaria’s FDI was
steadily increasing from 2002 to 2007, FDI in Europe fluctuated, declining from 2002 to
2004 and increasing from 2005 to 2007. From 2007 to 2008, FDI declined in both
Bulgaria and the EU, but unlike the European Union, Bulgaria’s FDI continued its
decline after 2008.
Figure 4 shows net FDI inflows in Bulgaria by industry from 1998 to 2014. Most
industries experienced an increase in FDI before EU accession and decreased after EU
accession. FDI in Real estate and business services, financial services, and retail and
wholesale trade peaked in 2007 and declined in subsequent years. FDI in Manufacturing
peaked in 2006 and declined in subsequent years. FDI in hotels and restaurants has been
more stables over time.
The distribution of Bulgaria’s FDI stock by industry for 2006 is shown in Figure

The member states of the European Union are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.

and retail trade, 16% in real estate and business services, 15% in financial services, 8% in
utilities, 7% in transportation and communication, 5% in construction and 5% in other.
Most of the foreign direct investment in Bulgaria originates in Europe. Distribution of
FDI by country of ultimate ownership in 2006 is shown in Figure 6. The largest investor
countries are Austria (17%), Netherlands (10%), Greece (9%) and the United Kingdom
(8%). Other countries with substantial investments in Bulgaria, 4% to 5% each, include
Belgium, Cyprus, Hungary and the United States.

6. Empirical Analysis and Results
Statistical descriptions of the data are available in Tables 1 and 2. Of the 856
firms, 13.1% are foreign owned (112 firms) (see Table 1). Table 1 shows the distribution
of domestic and foreign firms by industry. Each firm has a two digit SIC Code that was
classified into six industries, three in manufacturing and three in services. Foreign firms
in manufacturing are more likely to be in Industry 1. Industry 1 includes food products,
beverages, tobacco, textiles and apparels. Foreign firms in Services are more likely to be
in industry 6, which includes computer and related services, other business services,
recreational, cultural and sporting activities. Overall, most foreign firms are in services,
in industry 6, which includes 33% of all foreign firms, compared to 14.3% of domestic
firms.
Table 2 shows average statistics for foreign and domestic firms in manufacturing
and service industries. The table shows annual sales growth of domestic firms is higher
than those of foreign firms. From 2005 to 2006, sales grew by 41.1% on average in
domestic manufacturing firms compared with 16.9% in foreign firms. In the service

8

sector sales grew by 35.1% in domestic firms compared with 26.5% in foreign firms.
Foreign firms are more likely to be exporters. In manufacturing, foreign firms exported
67.0% of their sales compared 20.1% of sales of domestic firms. In services, foreign
firms exported 50.8% of sales compared with 8.5% of domestic firms. Capital to labor
ratios are lower for foreign firms than for domestic firms in both services and
manufacturing. Foreign firms are more likely to be larger, with a larger percentage in
medium and large employment categories. Moreover, foreign firms are more likely to
locate in Sofia.
The determinants of FDI regression results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
According to OLS and Logit regressions in Table 3, foreign manufacturing firms have
higher sales, export a larger percentage of their sales, have lower capital to labor ratio, are
more likely to have a medium or large employment size and are more likely to locate in
Sofia. Coefficients on these variables are significant at the 5% and 10% levels. Foreign
firms are not in industries with a large reduction in tariffs due to EU accession.
OLS and Logit regressions for service sector firms are shown in Table 4.
Foreign firms have higher sales, export a larger percentage of their sales and have lower
capital to labor ratio than domestic firms and are more likely to have a medium or large
employment size. They are also more likely to locate in Sofia. The coefficients are
significant at the 5% and 10% levels.
To analyze firm performance and investments, we estimated sales growth from
2005 to 2006, measured as the change in log of sales, whether the firm made capital
investments in 2006, and whether the firm has access to a credit line. Results for
manufacturing are shown in Table 5. Sales growth of manufacturing foreign firm is not

9

significantly different from domestic firms. Foreign manufacturing firms are less likely
to have made capital investments in 2006. The coefficient is significant at the 5% level.
We also find that firms that export a larger fraction of their sales are more likely to have
made capital investments in 2006. The coefficients are significant at the 5% level.
Foreign firms access to a credit line is not different from that of domestic firms. The
results also show firms with higher sales are more likely to have a credit line. The
coefficient is significant at the 10% level.
Results for service sector firms are shown in Table 6. Foreign firms’ sales growth
is not statistically from domestic firms. Foreign firms are not statistically different from
domestic firms in their likelihood of making capital investments in 2006. Firms with
greater sales are more likely to make capital investments. The coefficients are significant
at the 5% level. Foreign firms have similar access to a credit line than domestic firms.
Firms with higher capital to labor ratio are more likely to have a credit line. The
coefficients are significant at the 10% level.
To better understand the institutional conditions affecting firms in Bulgaria, we
estimated regressions on management time spent on government regulation and number
of times visited by tax officials. Results for manufacturing firms are shown in Table 7
and for service sector firms in Table 8. In manufacturing, foreign firms’ management
time spent on government regulation is not statistically different from domestics firms.
Firms with higher rates of exports are less likely to spend time on regulation. The
coefficient is significant at the 5% level. Firms that are in industries that experienced a
larger reduction in tariffs spend less time on government regulation. The coefficients are
significant at the 5% level. Foreign firms do not receive more visits from tax officials

10

when compared to domestic firms. However, firms that export a larger fraction of sales
experience more visits from tax officials.
In the service sector, time spent on government regulation for foreign firms is not
statistically different from domestics firms. Foreign firms receive less number of visits
from tax officials. The coefficient is significant at the 5% level. Service sector firms with
higher percentages of exports relative to sales and higher sales receive more visits from
tax officials. Older firms receive fewer visits from tax officials. All of these coefficients
are significant at the 5% level.

7. Conclusion
EU accession had the effect of increasing net inflows of FDI in Bulgaria.
However, net inflows of FDI peaked in 2007, the year of EU accession, gradually
declining until 2010. Net inflows of FDI have stayed below the levels Bulgaria achieved
in the early 2000s when the country signed the EU accession treaty.
We analyze World Bank BEEPS firm level data for 2007 to better understand the
characteristics and performance of foreign firms in Bulgaria. We estimate linear
probability and logit models to determine the likelihood a firm is foreign in Bulgaria.
Regressions show foreign manufacturing firms in Bulgaria are larger than domestic firms,
have lower capital to labor ratios and higher percentage of sales in exports. Foreign firms
are not in manufacturing industries that experienced larger reductions in tariffs due to
accession to the EU. Foreign firms in the service sector in Bulgaria are larger than
domestic firms, have a higher percentage of sales in exports and are more likely to locate
in Sofia.

11

We find sales growth and access to credit of foreign manufacturing firms are not
different from domestic firms. However, foreign manufacturing firms are less likely to
make capital investments than domestic firms. Sales growth, capital investments and
access to credit of service sector foreign firms are not different from domestic firms.
These results suggest foreign firm have had limited success in Bulgaria.
We measure institutional factors affecting foreign firms with time spent on
government regulation and number of times visited by tax officials. We find time spent
on government regulation is not different for foreign and domestic firms. Exporting firms
spend less time on government regulations. Number of visits from tax officials is not
different for domestic and foreign firms in manufacturing. Foreign firms experience less
visits from tax officials in the service sector. However, both in manufacturing and the
service sector , firms with a larger fraction of exports relative to sales experience greater
number of visits from tax officials. Since foreign firms are more likely to be exporters,
this suggests foreign firms are under more scrutiny. The findings suggest foreign firms
may be facing institutional challenges in Bulgaria.
While our findings do not explain the decline in FDI in Bulgaria after accession,
they provide a firm level perspective on the challenges foreign firms experience in
Bulgaria.
