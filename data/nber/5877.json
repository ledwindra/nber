Traditionally, interest rates and forward exchange rates have been used to extract expected means of future interest rates, exchange rates and inflation.  More recently, these methods have been refined to rely on implied forward interest rates, so as to extract expected future time-paths. Very recently only the means but the whole (risk neutral) probability distribution from a set of option prices.\n\n",
