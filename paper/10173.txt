JEL No. F17, F13, F15
ABSTRACT
This paper attempts to examine the impact of an East Asia FTA on trade patterns in East Asia by using a multisector computable general equilibrium model. The model used in this analysis is the standard GTAP model and
GTAP database developed by Hertel (1997) and his colleagues of Purdue University. Our findings are summarized
as follows: First, the impacts of an East Asia FTA on GDP and welfare of member countries are generally positive,
while the impacts on non-members are negative. Second, and surprisingly, the FTA does not seem to affect much
on the patterns of comparative advantage or intra-industry trade. Third, production of the sectors with a
comparative advantage increases. Fourth, unexpectedly, exports of protected sectors increase, reflecting a shift
in incentives from domestic sales to export sales. Finally, an East Asia FTA will promote regionalization in East
Asia but it will not necessarily promote regionalization in AFTA.

The Impacts of an East Asia FTA on Foreign Trade in East Asia

Introduction
The world economy has been witnessing the surge in free trade agreements (FTA)
since the early 1990s. Up to December 2002, some 250 FTAs have been notified to the
GATT/WTO, and of those 130 were notified after the establishment of the WTO in January
1995.1 More than 170 FTAs are currently in force, and additional 70 FTAs are expected to
be operational, although not yet notified. According to the WTO, by the end of 2005, if
FTAs reportedly planned or already under negotiation are concluded, the total number of
FTAs in force may approach 300. Among the regions of the world East Asia were not active
in establishing FTAs until recently. Indeed, until 2002, when Japan-Singapore FTA was
enacted, ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) was the only major FTA in the region. Many
East Asian economies started showing a strong interest in FTAs toward the end of the 1990s.
Although East Asia has so far seen the creation of only few FTAs including AFTA and
Japan-Singapore FTA, it is likely to observe the establishment of many FTAs in the near
future. Indeed, it may not be unrealistic to imagine the formation of the East Asia FTA,
covering all East Asian countries and economies.
In light of strong interest in FTAs by East Asian economies, this paper attempts to
examine the impact of East Asia FTA on trade patterns in East Asia by using a multi-sector
computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Since FTA removes tariff and non-tariff
barriers on trade among members, East Asia FTA is expected to have substantial impacts on
trade patterns of East Asian economies. An analysis of the impacts of an East Asia FTA is
useful not only for researchers interested in trade issues, but also for policy makers
responsible trade policies.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews recent developments in

Under the GATT/WTO the term regional trade agreements (RTAs), which include free
trade agreement (FTA) and customs union, are used to describe regionalization. But in this
paper we use the term FTAs to mean RTAs, as many RTAs, especially those in East Asia,
are FTAs. See WTO website, http://www.wto.org for the information on RTAs.

FTAs in East Asia. Section 3 presents the model and the data used in the simulation analysis.
One important objective of this section is to examine trade and protection patterns in East
Asia, to set the stage for the simulation analysis of the impact of East Asia FTA on trade in
East Asia. Section 4 discusses the results of the simulation. Section 5 concludes the paper.

Emergence of FTAs in East Asia
East Asia was not active in the formation of regional trade agreements such as free
trade agreements (FTAs) until recently2. Indeed, ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) was the
only major FTA until Japan and Singapore enacted Japan-Singapore FTA (formally
Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement) in November 2002. This section
provides a brief discussion on the recent developments concerning FTAs in East Asia.
AFTA was established in 1992 with six ASEAN member countries, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei. New ASEAN members,
Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos joined AFTA in the latter half of the 1990s, and
currently AFTA has 10 member countries. The main objective of AFTA is to develop
competitive industries in ASEAN by promoting intra-ASEAN trade. Several factors
contributed to the formation of AFTA. One is the realization of the need to capture export
market in the face of increasing FTAs in the world. Another factor is the emergence of
China as a competitor for attracting FDI. The end of the cold war also had an impact on
ASEAN as it made ASEAN concentrate on economic development. Besides AFTA,
ASEAN as a group as well as its members have become active in FTA discussions with
other countries. One of the FTAs involving ASEAN that has received most attention
recently is that with China, which will be discussed below. ASEAN is also discussing the
possibility of FTAs with Japan and Korea.
Compared to ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia, the countries in Northeast Asia
including China, Japan, and Korea had not been active in FTAs until recently. Despite
increasingly strong interest in FTAs by Northeast Asian countries, there is only one FTA
(Japan-Singapore FTA) that has been enacted so far. Japan is currently negotiating an FTA
with Mexico, and it has been studying possible FTAs with Korea, ASEAN, Thailand,
Malaysia, and the Philippines. The importance of FTAs with East Asian countries for Japan
and East Asia is understood by many Japanese, including policy makers and business

people. However, the moves toward the formation of FTAs have been rather weak because
of strong opposition from various groups such as non-competitive farmers, who would
suffer from trade liberalization of agricultural products.
Korea started having an interest in FTAs before Japan. In 1998 Korea disclosed a
plan to start FTA negotiations with Chile, and it also set up a joint-study group at private
level on FTA with Japan. Korea started negotiations with Chile in 1999, and Korea and
Chile signed the agreement in October 2002 after difficult negotiations on liberalization of
agricultural imports. Although the agreement was signed, it has not yet ratified by the
Korean National Assembly because of strong opposition from the farmers. Korea also
started studying the possible FTA with ASEAN.
China’s active FTA strategy has received a lot of attention. China joined the WTO
in 2001 and established an access to the world market, and it started to pursue regional
strategies by using FTAs. China signed a framework agreement on comprehensive
economic cooperation with ASEAN in November 2002. The agreement, which was
proposed strongly by China, has not only trade liberalization but also cooperation in the
areas of FDI and economic development. China and ASEAN started negotiations on FTA
January 2003 with a target for its conclusion by June 2004. China has offered various
schemes attractive to ASEAN and particularly to its new members such as economic
cooperation for the new ASEAN members and advanced trade liberalization (early harvest)
in agricultural products. In addition to ASEAN, China has proposed Japan and Korea to
establish a trilateral FTA including these three countries.
An idea of FTA covering East Asian countries has emerged. At the Leaders’
summit meeting of ASEAN+3 (China, Japan, and Korea) in 1998 the leaders decided to set
up East Asia Vision Group to study long term vision for economic cooperation. The group
has presented the leaders with recommendations including the establishment of East Asia
FTA. Despite the recommendation from the Vision Group, East Asia FTA has not yet
become a concrete agenda at the leaders meeting.
One can think of various factors that have led to an emerging interest in FTAs
among the countries in East Asia. Many countries consider FTAs as an effective way to
penetrate the market of the member countries. Some countries think FTAs would promote
deregulation and structural reform to revitalize their economy. The financial crisis in East
Asia increased the awareness of the need for regional cooperation such as FTAs to avoid
another crisis and to promote regional economic growth. Rivalry in the region has been a

3

factor contributing to an increased interest in FTAs. Specifically, both China and Japan,
which are competing to become a ‘leader’ in the region, are keen on using FTAs to
strengthen the relationships with ASEAN and the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs).
Indeed, in November 2002 Japan proposed an economic partnership framework to ASEAN
one day after China agreed to start FTA negotiations with ASEAN. It should also be noted
that ASEAN and the NIEs also consider FTAs as a means to maintain and increase their
influential position in East Asia.
Currently, the establishment of China-Japan-Korea FTA appears difficult not only
because of the opposition groups against trade liberalization but also because of the
differences in their views on past history and other non-economic issues. Rather than
China-Japan-Korea FTA, the establishment of three ASEAN+1 FTAs, namely
ASEAN-China, ASEAN-Japan, and ASEAN-Korea FTAs, may be more likely. Indeed,
ASEAN may be interested in establishing three ASEAN+1 FTAs to keep their negotiating
position before moving to the establishment of East Asia FTA.
Considering that FTA would contribute to economic growth of the countries
involved and considering that FTAs are likely to increase in other parts of the world, it is
hoped that East Asia work hard to establish East Asia FTA by overcoming the obstacles
with active cooperation. With these observations in mind, we attempt to investigate the
likely impacts of the East Asia FTA on East Asian economies in the following sections.

3. The Impacts of East Asia FTA on East Asian Economies: A Simulation Analysis
3.1. The Model
This section investigates the economic impacts of an East Asia FTA on East Asian
economies using the standard Global Trade Analysis Project model (GTAP model)
developed by Hertel (1997).3 This is a multi-sector, multi-country computable general
equilibrium (CGE) model that has been widely used in a number of studies. The
characteristics of the GTAP model are summarized as follows. The demand side of the
standard GTAP model assumes that total national income is allocated using fixed value
shares among three kinds of final demand — government, private household, and savings
3

The impacts of an East Asia FTA using CGE model are also examined in Ballard and
Cheong (1997) although they do not focus on the impacts on trade patterns. For more detail,
see Ballard and Cheong (1997).

— which are derived from an aggregate utility function of the Cobb-Douglas form. The
single representative household in each country maximizes a constant difference of
elasticity expenditure (CDE) function. CDE function is calibrated to different income and
the price elasticity of demand, and calibrated elasticity is used to specify private household
demand function.
On the production side, the standard GTAP model employs constant returns to scale
technology and perfect competition. Production in each sector in each country is
represented by a multi-level production function of a Leontief form that involves
value-added and intermediate inputs generated from the input-output tables. The demands
for factors and intermediate inputs are represented by a nested constant elasticity of
substitution (CES) function. Each firm uses a CES composite of domestically produced and
imported intermediate goods and determine the optimal mix of imported and domestic
goods given domestic and import prices. Imports are distinguished by country of origin
(Armington assumption).4
Labor is mobile across industries but not across countries. Capital is mobile across
industries and countries and its accumulation is endogenously determined. Investments are
assembled to be allocated across regions through a hypothetical global sector called the
global bank in such a way that the global bank equates the change in the expected rates of
return across countries. Transport margins are derived from equating supply and demand in
another hypothetical global sector called the global transportation sector. Equilibrium
satisfies the conditions in that demand equals supply for all goods and factors, and
representative firms in each industry earn zero profit.
3.2. The Data
Main data come from the GTAP database Release 5 (GTAP-5), which contains 66
countries/regions and 57 sectors for 1997. 5 The database provides production and
consumption structures described in a social accounting matrix for each country. To
facilitate the computation, the database is aggregated into 20 countries and 21 sectors.
In the GTAP database, trade barriers, which include tariff- and non-tariff measures,
are described as the differences between domestic market prices and world market prices.
4

For more detail about current standard GTAP model, see
http://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/products/models/current.asp.
5
For the GTAP-5, see Dimaranan and McDougal (2002).
5

Thus, the tariff and non-tariff measures cover import tariffs, export subsidies, and domestic
supports (output subsidies, intermediate input subsidies, land-based payments, and
capital-based payments).6 However, the information on the barriers in service trade is still
under development and does not cover many barriers.7 Hence, this paper focuses on
merchandise trade, that is, agricultural, mining and manufacturing trade in analyzing trade
flows.
3.2.1. Trade Patterns of East Asian Economies
Table 1 summarizes the export and import compositions of East Asian economies
in 1997 from GTAP-5. Three distinct features are observed in this table. First, major
exports of many East Asian economies are textile and machinery, especially electric
equipments. Second, major imports of many East Asian economies are concentrated in
electric equipments and general machinery. Third, the shares of imports for agriculture, and
food products and beverages are larger than the corresponding export shares for all the
economies except for Vietnam. However, we should also note that most East Asian
economies show low compositional shares in trade (exports and imports) for agriculture
and food products and beverages except for Thailand and Vietnam for exports and Japan for
imports.
=== Table 1 ===
Table 2 presents the intra-industry trade (IIT) patterns and revealed comparative
advantage (RCA) for East Asian economies8. The IIT index takes the value between 0 and
100, and it increases with the extent of intra-industry trade. RCA takes the value greater
than or equal to zero. If RCA for an industry for a country takes the value greater than unity,
it is interpreted that the country has a comparative advantage in that industry. Similarly, if it
takes the value less than unity, then the industry has a comparative disadvantage.
6

In GTAP-5, zero rates are reported for anti-dumping duties, price undertakings and
voluntary export restraints (VERs) due to the absence of up-to-date data (Dimaranan (2002,
p.16-A-11)).
7
Because of the limited data availability, the number of sectors significantly decreases
when we include the trade barriers in services in the CGE analysis. For a study that focuses
on the trade barriers in services, see Brown and Stern (2001).
8
For the formulas used to compute the IIT index and RCA index, see Appendix.
6

=== Table 2 ===
There are three notable findings in this table. First, for many economies, pulp,
chemicals, and electronic equipment tend to show large figures for the IIT index. Second,
most of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining and food products and beverages do not
register large ITT figures. Third, the largest RCA is likely to be observed in electric
equipment. Specifically, electric equipment presents largest RCA figures for Japan, Korea,
Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. The large numbers also appear in textiles
and fishing. It is interesting to note that transportation machinery takes values greater than
unity only for Japan and Korea, while general machinery takes values greater than unity
only for Japan and Taiwan.
These observations indicate that many East Asian economies have a comparative
advantage in the production of electric equipment, and many economies appear to engage
in vertical division of labor in electronic equipment production. Specifically, many East
Asian economies’ competitiveness comes from labor-intensive assembling operation in the
production of electronic equipment, as they import electronic parts and components to
assemble finish products and export them to foreign countries.
Table 3 presents the three types of regionalization measures in terms of trade for
East Asian economies 9 . The absolute measure compares the scale of a particular
intra-regional trade relationship to world trade, while the relative measure compares it to its
overall regional trade. The double relative measure, which is commonly called the trade
intensity index, shows the intensity or bias of the intra-regional trade relationship by taking
into account its importance in world trade. The value of unity for the double relative
measure can be interpreted so that the intra-regional trade relationship is neutral, while the
relationship is more (or less) biased when the measure is greater (or less) than unity.
The computed absolute measures show that intra-regional trade in East Asia and
ASEAN amount to 11 and 1 percent of world trade, respectively. As to the relative
measures, the share of intra-regional exports in East Asia’s exports was 44 percent, while
the share of intra-regional imports in East Asia’s imports was larger at 50 percent. These
9

The definitions of the three measures are given in Appendix. See Petri (1993) and Urata
(2001) for the discussion of the regionalization measures and their application to East Asian
economies.
7

findings on the relative measures for exports and imports indicate that East Asia is an
important source of imports rather than a destination of exports. The relative measures for
exports and imports for ASEAN are 21 and 20 percent, respectively, significantly smaller
compared with trade in East Asia. ASEAN countries depend on non-ASEAN countries,
particularly other East Asian countries, in their trade. The computed double-relative
measures show that trade in both East Asia and ASEAN have strong intra-regional bias.
Intra-regional bias is particularly strong for ASEAN trade, reflecting the presence of the
AFTA, under which preferential treatment is given to intra-ASEAN trade.
=== Table 3 ===
The results for disaggregated sector levels reveal several interesting developments.
First, for electronic equipment, fishing, and textiles intra-regional trade in East Asia has a
significant share in world trade, indicating that these products are actively traded in the
region. Second, for electronic equipment and textiles, East Asia is an important source of
imports rather than a destination of exports, reflecting the pattern of production and trade,
in which parts and components are procured in East Asia to be assembled for the finished
products in East Asia, which in turn are exported to outside the region. Third, high double
relative measures are observed for ASEAN trade vis-à-vis East Asia trade for all products
except mining, indicating the influence of the AFTA on trade in a wide range of products.
3.2.2 Nominal and Effective Rate of Protection for East Asian Economies
In the GTAP database, trade barriers, which include tariff- and non-tariff measures,
can be expressed as the differences of prices between domestic market prices and world
market prices. We denote the difference as the nominal rate of protection (NRP). We also
compute the effective rate of protection (ERP), which accounts for the protection on value
added by taking into account of protection given not only to the product under study but
also to intermediate inputs used for the product.10
Table 4 presents the calculated results of NRPs and ERPs from the GTAP database.
There are three notable findings in this table. First, for China, Japan and Korea, the levels
of protection on agriculture and food products and beverages are extremely high. NRPs on
food products and beverages are also high for these three countries and Taiwan. The results
10

Appendix explains the computational method of ERP.
8

for China are somewhat surprising, as China exports substantial magnitudes of agricultural
products, food products and beverages.
=== Table 4 ===
Similarly, ERPs tend to high for these industries in these countries with few
exceptions, indicating that these industries are given substantial protection from import
competition. Two exceptions are agriculture in Taiwan and food products and beverages in
Korea, for which negative ERPs are obtained. These negative results are due to the fact that
NRPs given to intermediate goods for the production of agriculture (in the case of Taiwan)
and food products and beverages (in the case of Korea) are higher than NRPs given to
agriculture, and food products and beverages. In other words, agriculture in Taiwan and
food products and beverages in Korea suffer from negative discrimination imposed by their
governments.
Second, high level of protection is given in paper, chemicals and machinery
industries in ASEAN countries as well as China, and these industries tend to present larger
figures for ERP than for NRP. Such patterns of protection, that is, higher ERP than NRPs,
are common in many countries and characterized as tariff escalation. Indeed, tariff
escalation is regarded as rational patterns of tariff protection for the development of a
particular industry, although the effectiveness of such policy appears questionable. It is to
be noted that high protection is observed for transportation machinery industry in many
ASEAN countries and China, reflecting the importance of the industry for these
governments.
Third, there are virtually almost no trade barriers in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Only agriculture and food products and beverages receive protection, although the level of
protection given to this industry by these governments is substantially low when compared
to the cases for other East Asian economies.

4.

Simulation Results
We conducted a simulation analysis to discern the impacts of an East Asia FTA by
removing trade barriers among East Asian economies. In this section we examine the
results. We begin with the results for GDP and economic welfare in terms of equivalent

9

variation (EV), and then turn to the results on overall as well as sectoral outputs and trade.
Table 5 presents simulation results for GDP and EV for East Asian economies with
a few selected countries. The results indicate that all FTA member economies obtain
benefits from an East Asia FTA in terms of GDP and EV. The positive impacts are very
large for the ASEAN countries. Among the ASEAN countries Thailand gains substantially.
Indeed, Thai GDP is estimated to increase as much as 16 percent from an East Asia FTA.
Large gain for Thailand is attributable mainly to high protection imposed on the Thai
economy before East Asia FTA. Vietnam and Indonesia also would gain substantially from
an East Asia FTA.
By contrast to the gains accrued to the FTA members, non-member countries
experience negative impacts in the forms of declines in GDP and EV. These negative
impacts are mainly attributable to the trade diversion effect from the East Asia FTA, by
which non-member countries’ exports to East Asia are substituted by member countries’
exports as a result of preferential treatment given to trade between the members. It should
be noted that the negative impacts on the United States and the EU are quite small while
they are somewhat substantial for Australia/New Zealand and other Asia. Relatively large
negative impacts for Australia/New Zealand and other Asia stem from the fact that East
Asia is a very important region for their export destination. Since the results of the
simulation depend on the elasticity of substation between domestic and imported products,
we examine how sensitive our results are to the size of elasticity by conducting a simulation
with 10 percent increase in the elasticity values. We found that the results are greater by
approximately 10 percent, indicating the importance of the size of elasticities in
determining the impacts of FTA11.
=== Table 5 ===
The impacts of an East Asia FTA on the changes in real outputs and real exports in
agriculture and manufacturing sectors are presented in Table 6. For Hong Kong, Singapore,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, positive impacts on real outputs are
observed in almost all industries. One major exceptional sector is transportation machinery,
whose production declines for these economies except for the Philippines. Indeed, it should
be noted that production of transportation machinery declines for all the economies except
11

The results are not given in the paper, but they are available on request from the authors.
10

Japan and the Philippines. Unlike the case for many economies noted above, China, Japan,
Korea, and Taiwan show sectoral variations in the direction of the changes in output.
Notable increases in output production are observed for the following sectors for the
East Asian economies; agriculture (China, Singapore, and Thailand), food products and
beverages (Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand), textiles (Korea, Taiwan,
Philippines, and Vietnam), electronic equipment (China, Indonesia, Philippines, and
Thailand), and general machinery (Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand). Some notable
declines in output production are recorded as follows; agriculture (Japan and Korea), iron
and steel (Vietnam), and transportation machinery (China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, and Vietnam). These findings reveal the difficulty in establishing an East Asia
FTA because of its negative impacts on the sectors with political influence in respective
economies.
=== Table 6 ===
We have examined the impacts of an East Asia FTA on output at sectoral level and
found variations in its impacts among the sectors. It is of interest to examine if any
systematic patterns exist in explaining the impact of an East Asia FTA among different
sectors and economies. One would expect that output of the sector that has a comparative
advantage would increase more compared to that of the sectors with comparative
disadvantage as a result of FTA, because freer trade environment would give greater
opportunities for output expansion for the sectors with comparative advantage. Along the
similar line of the argument one would expect that output of the protected sector would
decline as a result FTA because of increased import competition. We examined these
hypotheses by conducting regression analysis covering 11 economies and 13 sectors. For
the analysis three different models are examined. The dependent variable, which is the
same for the three models, is the rate of change in output, and explanatory variables are
RCA, NRP, and ERP at base year, respectively. The results of the analysis support the first
hypothesis, indicating that FTA increase output of the sectors with comparative advantage
(Table 7). However, they do not support the second hypothesis.
=== Table 7 ===

11

It is interesting to observe that exports increase for all the economies for almost all
products with a few exceptions. Even exports of transportation machinery, whose
production is shown to decline, are expected to increase for all the economies except for
Hong Kong and Singapore. These contrasting patterns of change in production and exports
in transportation machinery reflect increased incentive given to exportation as a result of
elimination of protection under the East Asia FTA. The sectors with substantial increase in
exports include the following: agriculture (China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the
Philippines), food products and beverages (all economies), textiles (Japan, Korea, and
Vietnam), transport machinery (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and
Vietnam), electronic equipment (China, Indonesia, and Thailand), and general machinery
(Indonesia and Thailand). One should note that these values are the rate of change, as such
a large value may be partly due to the low initial value before the formation of an East Asia
FTA. A case in point is agriculture and food products and beverages for Japan, for which
large rates of export growth are expected partly because of low export value before the
formation of an East Asia FTA.
Following the discussions on the determinants of the change in output above, we
examine the determinants of the change in exports using the same framework. One would
expect the sectors with a comparative advantage and the sectors with low protection to
increase as a result of an East Asia FTA. The results show that exports of the sectors with
high protection increase as a result of East Asia FTA. This unexpected result can be
explained by a shift of incentives from domestic sales to export sales because of the
removal of protection. As to the relationship between RCA and export expansion, we could
not detect the expected relationship.
The impacts of an East Asia FTA on export change lead to the changes in the
composition of exports, which are shown in Table 8. The figures for 1997 indicate the
export composition in 1997 (obtained from Table 1) and those under FTA indicate the
export composition after the simulation. Italic figures indicate the percentage changes
between compositions in 1997 and those in FTA.
=== Table 8===
The results show that the impacts of East Asia FTA are not large enough to change

12

the composition of each economy’s exports and imports substantially12. Specifically, the
changes in exports with more than 5.0 percentage points are confirmed for only a few
sectors such as mining in Vietnam, food products and beverages in Korea and Thailand and
textiles in Vietnam. For other sectors and economies, the magnitudes of the changes are less
than 5.0 percentage points, most of which are less than 1.0 percentage point.
An analysis of the impacts of an East Asia FTA on intra-industry trade pattern is of
interest. One would argue that FTA may expand intra-industry trade because enlarged
regional market resulting from the elimination of trade barriers gives greater trade
opportunities for differentiated products. However, the results shown in Table 9 do not
support this argument, as more than a half cases, specifically 73 cases out of 143 cases (11
economies and 13 sectors), show a minus sign, reflecting the decline in the intra-industry
trade.
=== Table 9 ===
We now turn to the impacts of an East Asia FTA on regional trading patterns. Table
10 presents the regionalization indexes for East Asia and ASEAN countries. The results
indicate that for overall trade all three regionalization measures increase for East Asia as a
result of an East Asia FTA. These observations, which appear to reflect that the trade
diversion effect is greater than the trade creation effect, indicate that the establishment of
the FTA promotes regionalization. This result is consistent with our expectation because
FTA is trade arrangement, which treat the members preferentially and non-members
discriminatorily. Contrary to the case for East Asia as a whole, intra-regional trade bias
declines for ASEAN, although the absolute and relative measures of regionalization
increase. This finding indicates that for ASEAN extra-ASEAN trade expands faster than
intra-ASEAN trade.
=== Table 10 ===

12

It should be added that an East Asia FTA does not change the patterns of revealed
comparative advantage (RCA) significantly, as can be expected from small changes in the
compositions of exports. The RCA figures under an East Asia FTA are available from the
authors on request.
13

At the sector-level, for almost all sectors absolute and relative measures increase as
a result of an East Asia FTA. This means that the importance of intra-regional trade in East
Asia and AFTA countries increase with respect to the world trade as well as their own trade.
The rates of change are particularly high for agriculture, food products and beverages, and
transportation machinery for East Asia. Unlike the patterns observed for the absolute and
relative measures, the rates of change for the double relative measure are not uniform. For
East Asian trade, large increases in regional bias are observed for agriculture, pulp, paper,
and paper products, and general machinery, while notable decline is observed for chemicals.
For ASEAN many products show a decline in a bias with notable exceptions for agriculture
and general machinery. These results imply that an East Asia FTA promotes the
regionalization within East Asia, and it encourages ASEAN countries to have closer
relationship with other East Asian economies.

Conclusions
In light of increasingly strong interest in FTAs and an East Asia FTA among many
East Asian economies, we investigated the economic impacts of an East Asia FTA on East
Asian economies with a focus on trade patterns by conducting a simulation analysis
utilizing a computable general equilibrium model. We found that an East Asia FTA brings
positive impacts to East Asian economies in terms of economic growth and economic
welfare. As to its impacts on trade patterns for East Asian economies, the simulation results
show relatively small impacts but they reveal some interesting patterns. We found that the
sectors with a comparative advantage increase output and those with strong protection
increase exports. The former relationship is expected but the latter finding is not consistent
with the expectation. One explanation for this unexpected result is that an FTA shifts an
incentive from domestic sales to export sales for protected sectors. Although exports of
many sectors would increase as a result of an East Asia FTA, output production of some
sectors is likely to decline. These potentially impacted sectors do oppose an East Asia FTA.
To overcome such opposition and to establish an East Asia FTA, financial and technical
assistance should be given to potentially impacted workers to ameliorate the costs of
adjustment. An East Asia FTA is found to promote regionalization in trade in East Asia,
partly at the cost of exports from outside the region. Indeed, it has negative impacts in
terms of economic growth and welfare on non-members. These findings argue strongly the

14

need to pursue worldwide trade liberalization under the WTO. Indeed, the formation of an
East Asia FTA has to be regarded as a step toward multilateral liberalization.
We have examined the impacts of an East Asia FTA on trade patterns in East Asia
by using a CGE model. Our results present useful information on the likely impacts of such
FTA. However, we do realize some shortcomings. First, there are some features of FTAs
that could not be incorporated satisfactorily in our model, and we need to devise the ways
to incorporate them more satisfactorily. They include rules of origin, foreign direct
investment (FDI), technology transfer associated with FDI, international labor mobility and
others. Besides the issues related to the simulation model, which is constructed at the sector
level, we also realize the need to investigate the likely impacts of FTAs at firm level, to
discern the detailed impacts of FTAs. As the availability of firm-level data has become
better in recent years, researchers should analyze the impacts of trade liberalization on
firms’ trading behavior, to draw some implications on the impacts of FTAs. Finally we
strongly hope that our results will be used for policy discussions on an East Asia FTA.

Appendix. Definitions of Variables
Regionalization index
We use three types of regionalization index. First index is called absolute measure
and defined as:
A=

x jk

∑∑
k

x
j jk

,

where j and k indicate home and partner countries, respectively. x jk represents
exports from country j to country k , respectively. Therefore, absolute measure captures
export the share of country j to country k relative to world total exports.
Second index is called relative measure, which is defined as:

B=

∑

A

x
k jk

∑∑
k

x
j jk

=

x jk

∑

x
k jk

.

The relative measure indicates the export share of country j to country k relative to
country j ’s total exports.
Third index is called double relative measure. Double relative measure is the
divided by home and partner export shares so that we could partly control both home and
partner’s scale.

C=

(∑ x
k

jk

∑∑
k

A
j

x jk

)(∑ x
j

jk

∑∑
k

j

x jk

)

=

16

x jk × ∑k ∑ j x jk

∑

j

x jk × ∑k x jk

,

The value of exports is evaluated at the domestic market price while value of imports is
evaluated at the world price.
Intra-Industry Trade (IIT) index
Intra-industry index is defined as:

∑k xijk − mijk  × 100,
IITij = 1 −
 ∑ ( xijk + mijk ) 
k



where i , j and k indicate industry, home country and partner country, respectively.

xijk and mijk represent exports and imports of industry i in country j to country k ,
respectively. IIT index takes value between 0 and 100. The larger the index is, the larger the
intra-industry trade will be. The value of exports is evaluated at the domestic market price
while the value of imports is evaluated at the world price.
Note that the definition of IIT index in GTAP model is different from that of
Grubel=Lloyd type IIT index. The former is differentiated across countries in the same
industry. The latter is differentiated across sub-industries (or detailed level of industries) in
the same industry.
Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)
RCA is defined as:
RCAij =

∑

xij
x
j ij

∑x
∑∑x
i

j

ij

i

,
ij

where i and j indicate industry and home country, respectively. xij represents exports
of industry i in country j to world and evaluated at domestic market price. Therefore,

RCAij > 1 means that industry i in country j has comparative advantage (compared
with world average) while RCAij < 1 means i in country
disadvantage.

17

j

has comparative

Nominal Rate of Protection (NRP)
The rate of protection in imports is defined as:
t ij = (mijM − mijW ) mijW ,

where i and j indicate industry and home country. mijM and mijW are the values of
imports evaluated at the domestic market price and at the world price, respectively. Hence,
the rate of protection in imports includes both tariff barriers and non-tariff measures.
Effective Rate of Protection (ERP)
We define Effective Rate of Protection (ERP) as follows.
ERPij =

t ij − ∑ z t mj aizj
1 − ∑ z aizj

,

where i , z and j indicate final goods industry, intermediate goods industry and home
country, respectively. aizj indicate the input coefficient from industry i to m in country

j obtained from input-output table in GTAP database. t ij is the NRP defined as above.
The rate of protection in this analysis, therefore, includes both tariff and non-tariff barriers.

Notes: 1) The figures in 1997 indicate the export composition in 1997 (from Table 1).
2) The figures in FTA indicate the export composition resulting from FTA (model simulation).
3) The changes indicate the difference between 1997 and FTA (percentage points).
4) Non-manufacturing do not include service sectors.
5) Services are not reported since trade barriers in service sectors are not available and it might underestimate the impacts of an East Asia FTA.

Notes: 1) The figures in 1997 indicate the IIT index in 1997 (from Table 2).
2) The figures in FTA indicate the IIT index under FTA.
3) The changes indicate the difference between 1997 and FTA.
4) Services are not reported since trade barriers in service sectors are not available and it might underestimate the impacts of an East Asia FTA.
