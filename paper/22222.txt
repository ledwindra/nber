ABSTRACT
In 2010, the Ministry of Education in Trinidad and Tobago converted 20 low-performing
secondary schools from coeducational to single-sex. I exploit these conversions to identify the
causal effect of single-sex schooling holding other school inputs constant. After also accounting
for student selection, single-sex cohorts at conversion schools score higher on national exams and
are four percentage points more likely to complete secondary school. There are also important
non-academic effects; all-boys cohorts have fewer arrests as teens, and all-girls cohorts have
lower teen pregnancy rates. These benefits are achieved at zero financial cost. Survey evidence
suggests that these single-sex effects reflect both direct gender peer effects due to interactions
between classmates, and indirect effects generated through changes in teacher behavior.

The Effect of Single-Sex Education on Test Scores, School Completion,
Arrests, and Teen Motherhood: Evidence from School Transitions
By C. KIRABO JACKSON 1
In 2010, the Ministry of Education in Trinidad and Tobago converted 20 low-performing
secondary schools from coeducational to single-sex. I exploit these conversions to identify
the causal effect of single-sex schooling holding other school inputs constant. After also
accounting for student selection, single-sex cohorts at conversion schools score higher on
national exams and are four percentage points more likely to complete secondary school.
There are also important non-academic effects; all-boys cohorts have fewer arrests as
teens, and all-girls cohorts have lower teen pregnancy rates. These benefits are achieved
at zero financial cost. Survey evidence suggests that these single-sex effects reflect both
direct gender peer effects due to interactions between classmates, and indirect effects
generated through changes in teacher behavior. (JEL I20, J00)
It is well-documented that boys and girls may react differently to the same environments. 2
In addition, in some contexts, boys and girls have better academic performance when exposed to
more same-sex classmates. 3 These patterns have led some to advocate for single-sex education –
a controversial form of tracking such that boys and girls are educated in separate classrooms or
schools. The merits of single-sex education have been debated for decades. However, there is a
paucity of credible evidence on the effects of expanding single-sex education. This paper helps fill
this gap by analyzing academic, crime, and teen fertility effects of a policy in Trinidad and Tobago
under which twenty low-performing coeducational (coed) schools were converted to single-sex.
This research is the first analysis of (a) a large-scale policy to expand single-sex education to lowachieving students, and (b) the causal effect of single-sex schooling on crime and teen fertility.
If beneficial, single-sex instruction would be tremendously cost-effective as it involves only
the re-allocation of existing resources and no additional financial costs. 4 In theory, holding other
schooling attributes fixed, single-sex education may improve outcomes because single-sex

classrooms may (a) allow for instruction tailored to the specific needs of each sex, (b) allow
teachers to focus better on instruction, and (c) remove opposite sex peers who may affect social
dynamics in ways that are deleterious to student outcomes. Conversely, by depriving youth of
opposite-sex peers, single-sex education could lead to poor socialization, generate negative social
interactions, and reinforce sex stereotypes (Eliot 2016). 5 To fix ideas, I present a model of singlesex schooling that nests the mechanisms above. The model highlights that single-sex schooling is
neither always good nor always bad for either boys or girls. Moreover, the model suggests that the
distinctions between single-sex schools, single-sex cohorts, and single-sex classrooms have to do
with which mechanisms may be at play in each situation. To help make sense of the existing
empirical literature, the model highlights settings in which single-sex education will likely benefit
or hurt students. I also derive testable implications and evaluate them empirically.
Parents tend to perceive single-sex schools as being superior to coed schools (Jackson 2012,
Park et al. 2013), and more than one-third of Americans support having single-sex public schooling
options (Howell, West, and Peterson 2008). Observational evidence supports these views; in the
US, single-sex charter schools (such as the well-known Urban Prep Academies) that enroll lowincome ethnic-minority students boast college-going rates well above average for schools serving
similar populations (Chavous 2013). In England, nineteen of the 20 highest-ranked public high
schools in 2016 were single-sex (Woolcock 2017). Also, graduates from all-women’s colleges are
more likely to pursue graduate degrees and have better labor market outcomes than those who
attended similar coeducational institutions (Day 2008), and girls at all-girls schools are purported
to be less likely to become pregnant as teens. 6 Across many national contexts, single-sex schools
are associated with better outcomes (Mael et al. 2005). However, because of possible student
selection to schools, it is unclear whether these apparent successes reflect causal relationships.
To address this selection problem, a few recent studies rely on quasi-random assignment of
students to schools to compare outcomes at single-sex schools to those at coed schools among
students who are similar in both observable and unobservable ways. 7 These studies have found
positive effects of all-boys schools (Lee et al. 2014), all-girls schools (Jackson 2012), or both
(Park, Behrman and Choi 2013, Ku and Kwak 2013). However, because schools do not become
Booth and Nolen (2012) find that females tend to have less stereotypical traits in single-sex grouping or schools.
This is a key claim made by the National Association for Single-sex Public Education.
7
There is an older research literature in which researchers were unable to credibly disentangle the effects of single-sex
schooling from the characteristics of the students who chose to attend single-sex schools (see Mael et al. 2005).

single-sex at random, single-sex schools may differ from coed schools in unobserved ways that
preclude a like-with-like comparison. Indeed, both Jackson (2012) and Ku and Kwak (2013)
document that single-sex schools tend to have better observable characteristics than coed schools.
As such, these cross-school comparisons (while informative about schools) are uninformative
about whether students benefit from single-sex education per se. Therefore, they do not speak to
the policy-relevant question of how expanding single-sex education may affect student outcomes.
To address these limitations, I analyze a policy experiment in Trinidad and Tobago. In 2010,
the Ministry of Education (MOE) identified ten pairs (20 in total) of geographically close, similarly
sized, low-performing coed public secondary schools. One school in each pair was converted to
all-boys, and the other to all-girls. The transition was gradual such that the incoming 6th-grade
cohorts after 2010 were single-sex while the previously admitted cohorts remained coed. The
selected schools had no control over this decision. In addition, to ensure a clean experiment, the
MOE dictated that there be no other changes at these 20 schools. Because this experiment allows
one to compare students who attended the same school under both coed and single-sex regimes,
one can isolate the effect of adopting a single-sex policy from that of unobserved school-level
differences that might exist between coed and single-sex schools in other settings. 8
To analyze this policy experiment, I link student admission records before secondary
school entry to national examination data three and five years later, arrest records, and birth
registry data. These data allow me to analyze the effect of single-sex education on a broad array
of outcomes. These outcomes include test performance across both academic and non-academic
subjects, the upper-level subjects taken, high-school dropout, earning a high school completion
credential, being arrested as a teen, and teen motherhood. I supplement these administrative data
with survey data collected during the policy experiment to present evidence on mechanisms.
To identify the effect of the transition from coed to single-sex holding other school inputs
constant (i.e. a single-sex effect), I compare the outcomes of student cohorts who attended the
same secondary school but who were admitted under coed versus single-sex regimes (i.e. before
versus after the phased transition to single-sex). While this transition allows one to hold both other

8

In a working paper, Ku and Kwak (2013) study outcomes at nine all-boys schools and four all-girls schools that
changed from single-sex to coed and find that males performed better in coed environments while females fared worse.
In related work, Booth, Cardona-Sosa and Nolen (2013) randomly assign students to all-girls and all-boys discussion
sections in a University economics course. The authors find positive effects for females. It is unclear that these results
will generalize to the context of secondary school children, or those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

observed, and other unobserved, school inputs fixed, it does not ensure that student populations
are comparable across cohorts. To address this concern, I exploit discontinuities in the school
assignment rules to isolate exogenous variation in school attendance and remove bias due to
student selection. Specifically, I combine exogenous variation in school assignments with
exogenous within-school changes in single-sex status to compare the causal effect of attending an
experimental school under the coed regime to the causal effect of attending that same school under
the single-sex regime. I present several empirical tests to show that this strategy is valid.
After accounting for both student selection and unobserved school-level differences, I find
large positive effects of the transition to single-sex of about 0.2 standard deviations (sd) on math
achievement on tests taken three years after secondary-school entry. These math test-score effects
are equivalent to reducing class size by about 30 percent or increasing teacher quality by 2 sd.
However, these benefits were gained at zero financial cost. Importantly, I show that the crossschool variation confounds any correlated school-level effects with the single-sex education effect
–validating the use of within-school variation. I find similar effects on other academic subjects for
boys, with smaller and less robust effects on test scores in other subjects for girls. The positive test
score effects reflect improvements throughout the achievement distribution for boys and more
marked improvements in the upper tails for girls.
Single-sex education may affect human capital in ways not well measured by test scores
(Jackson 2013, J. Heckman 1999). As such, I present the first analysis of the causal effect of singlesex schooling on a broad set of non-test-score outcomes. Looking at non-test score academic
outcomes, five years after secondary school entry, both boys and girls are more likely to take
advanced courses in the single-sex cohorts. In addition, single-sex cohorts at experimental schools
are roughly four percentage points (12 percent) more likely to earn a secondary-school-leaving
credential. Looking at social outcomes, boys in single-sex cohorts are roughly six percentage
points (60 percent) less likely to be arrested by the age of 18, and the all-girls cohorts are about six
percentage points (about 50 percent) less likely to have a live birth by the age of 18. 9
One limitation of the extant literature on single-sex education is a lack of evidence on
mechanisms. To help in this regard, I administered student surveys at experimental and comparison

9

These social effects are economically important outside of the Trinidad and Tobago context. In the United States
almost half of black males, 40 percent of white males are arrested by age 23 (Brame and Bushway 2014), and one in five
American women have a live birth as a teen (Bialik 2009).

schools in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Surveys provide suggestive evidence that gender peer effects are
complex. For girls, surveys suggest positive direct peer effects in all-girls settings through less
peer distraction, less peer disruption, and more peer learning. For boys, the direction of the direct
peer effects is unclear. Consistent with Lee et al. (2014), I find evidence of positive indirect peer
effects through changes in teacher behaviors in single-sex settings. That is, there is evidence of
efficiency gains for teachers to the more homogeneous single-sex classrooms. The positive overall
effects for both sexes echo Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2011) who find that both low- and highachievement students benefit from achievement tracking.
This paper makes a few important contributions. First, it contributes to our understanding
of single-sex education by laying out a model outlining the contexts in which single-sex education
is likely to be beneficial or harmful. Second, it is the first paper to identify the policy-relevant
effect of converting coed schools to single-sex. Third, it adds to the literature documenting a causal
link between education and crime. Fourth, it is the first paper to credibly link single-sex schooling
to teen pregnancy outcomes. Fifth, it contributes to the tracking literature. Finally, given the
population under study, the findings contribute to the literature on how certain types of schools
can help disadvantaged youth (e.g. Fryer 2014, Deming, Hastings, and Staiger 2013). 10
The remainder of the paper is as follows: Section I lays out a theoretical model of singlesex schooling to inform and guide the subsequent empirical work. Section II describes the policy
landscape, the policy experiment, and describes the data used in the study. Section III lays out the
empirical strategy. Section IV presents the main empirical results, robustness checks and evidence
on mechanisms. Section V presents a discussion and concludes.

A Simple Model of Single-Sex Education
Much of the debate on single-sex education is focused on whether single-sex education

works or does not work, and results from the empirical literature are mixed. However, there are
several mechanisms through which single-sex education may affect student outcomes such that

10

However, the results speak to the effect of having all instruction in single-sex classes, which may be different from
that of having a few single-sex classes in a coed school. Strain (2013) finds that introducing single-sex classes reduced
achievement in math, and Lee et. al. (2014) find that single-sex classrooms within coed schools reduce boys’
achievement while single-sex schools improve their outcomes. Also note that I present the effect of schools
transitioning from coed to single-sex, holding teacher quality and other inputs fixed. This is a key parameter of interest.
However, it may not represent of the long-run general equilibrium effects of introducing single-sex schooling to an
education system if school inputs change in response to changes in the distribution of the student body in the long run.
The data requirements for such an analysis would be considerable.

“work” versus “not work” dichotomy may be too simplistic. To help make sense of the disparate
findings in the literature and to motivate my own empirical work, I present a model that nests
common explanations for single-sex schooling effects and allows for three separate (not mutually
exclusive) mechanisms through which single-sex education can affect student outcomes. The
model shows that single-sex education (relative to coed) may have different effects depending on
context, and it highlights the conditions under which single-sex education effects may emerge.
Student Outcomes:
Student outcomes are given by (1) where Yijg is the outcome of student i with teacher j of
gender 𝑔𝑔 ∈ {𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔, 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏}, Gi is an indicator equal to 1 if student i is a girl and 0 otherwise. 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ is the

share of girls in class with teacher j, the proportion of time that teacher j aligns instruction to girls
is 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ∈ [0,1], and uij is a random mean zero error term.
(1)

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 + 𝑓𝑓𝑔𝑔 �𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ � + ℎ𝑔𝑔 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 + 𝜓𝜓�2𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 − 1� + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

There are three channels through which gender peer composition affects student outcomes.
There is a direct gender peer effect and two indirect effects; the boutique effect and the focus
effect. In (1), 𝑓𝑓𝑔𝑔 �𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ � captures the direct gender peer effect that operates through peer interactions.

Some studies find female classmates improve all students’ outcomes— arguably because boys are
disruptive (Hoxby 2000; Lavy and Schlosser 2011). However, others find that students have better

outcomes when exposed to same gender peers— arguably because the opposite sex is distracting
(Black et al 2013; Ooserbeek and van Ewijk 2014; Lu and Anderson 2015). To allow for
differential responses to the proportion of female classmates, I include the subscript g on 𝑓𝑓𝑔𝑔 .

The term, ℎ𝑔𝑔 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 captures the idea that that certain teaching practices may benefit girls more

than boys and vice versa. Where 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 is the proportion of time the teacher spends “aligning”

classroom practices to the needs of girls, ℎ𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ≥ 0 and ℎ𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 ≤ 0. The idea that students may

benefit from similar peers because instruction can be aligned to their type undergirds the
“Boutique” model of peer effects (Hoxby and Weingarth 2006), and is posited in Duflo, Kremer
and Dupas (2011) model of ability tracking. This “Boutique effect” captures an indirect peer effect
because the teacher’s choice of pj may depend on the gender composition in the classroom. 11

11

The term 𝜓𝜓�2𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 − 1� captures the idea that there may be some efficiency gains for

This gender alignment effect could be driven by the kinds of teaching examples used, the pedagogical practices
employed, the discipline practices used, or even the ability level to which the class is pitched. As an example of
gendered content, sports-based examples might be more engaging for boys than for girls.

teachers associated with focusing their instruction to one group (either boys or girls). Hoxby and
Weingarth (2006) call this the “focus” mode of peer interactions. Importantly, unlike the boutique
effect, the focus effect is the same for all students. This focus term is motivated by the finding that
students tend to have better outcomes in more homogeneous classroom environments (e.g. Hoxby
and Weingarth 2006, Ding and Lehrer 2007). The efficiency gains may be due to teachers spending
less time planning lessons for two separate audiences, or teachers spending less time managing the
disengagement of those students whose type is not being catered to at any given point in time. This
“focus effect” term captures another indirect peer effect because the teacher’s choice of alignment
(𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ) may depend on the gender composition in the classroom.
Teacher’s Choice of Alignment (pj):

To understand how the indirect peer effects (i.e. the focus and boutique effects) operate
across coed and single-sex settings, one must model how teachers chose gender alignment (𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ) as

a function of the gender composition (𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ ). A teacher’s payoff is an increasing function of the
outcomes of her class 𝑊𝑊(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 ) so that 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕/𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑖𝑖 > 0 ∀𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑗𝑗. Teachers chose how much time to

spend aligning instruction to girls (𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ) in order to maximize their individual payoff. As shown

formally in Appendix A, teachers will employ entirely male-aligned instruction (pj=0) in all-male

classrooms and entirely female-aligned instruction (pj=1) in all-female classrooms. Intuitively, if
teachers prefer it when their students have better outcomes, they will align all their instruction to
girls in all-girls classroom and to boys in all-boys classrooms. Appendix A also shows that a
teacher’s choice of alignment in mixed-gender classrooms is unclear ex-ante, and depends on the
parameters of the production function and the incentives faced by teachers. This result implies that
the behaviors of teachers in single-sex relative to coed settings are context specific.
Expected Benefits of Single-Sex Instruction:
Taking expectations of equation (1) for students in single-sex environments minus that for
coed environments will yield the single-sex treatment effect β, the expected difference in outcomes
in single-sex environments (s=1) relative to coed environments (s=0). Because coed classrooms
1
are roughly half female, I assume (𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ |𝑠𝑠 = 0) = . The single-sex treatment effect for girls and

boys is given by (2) and (3) below, respectively.

The single-sex schooling effect for each sex depends on three factors. The first factor is the
1

2

benefit from more female classmates then, all else equal, girls will be better off in single-sex

settings and boys will be worse off. However, if both boys and girls benefit from more same-sex
classmates, then both boys and girls in single-sex settings will enjoy positive direct peer effects.
Importantly, the direct peer interaction effect can be positive or negative for either boys or girls.
The next two factors reflect indirect peer effects through teacher action. The second factor
is the “boutique effect” (i.e. the effect of having greater alignment to one’s own type) from
ℎ𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 (0) − ℎ𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 |𝑠𝑠 = 0� and ℎ𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 (1) − ℎ𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 |𝑠𝑠 = 0�. The boutique effect is nonnegative,

but the magnitude depends on alignment in coed settings. That is, the benefits of all-boys classes
to boys is larger if coed classes are more girl aligned and vice versa. This is important, because the
choice of alignment in coed settings depends on teachers’ incentives, which may vary from context
to context. If teachers split their attention in coed settings (i.e. 0 < 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 < 1), both boys and girls in

single-sex settings may benefit from the boutique effect. The third factor is the “focus effect” (i.e.
the positive effect of having a teacher focus her instruction to only one type) and is summarized
with 𝜓𝜓 − 𝜓𝜓�2𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 − 1�. The more teachers split their time between aligning instruction to both girls

and boys in coed settings, the greater is the benefit to single-sex schooling for both boys and girls.
However, if teachers are already fully aligned to any one group in coed settings, then there would
be no additional focus effect in the single-sex settings for that group.
A key implication of the model is that under rational behavior, the indirect effects of singlesex schooling are non-negative. However, the direct peer effects can lead to negative single-sex
schooling effects. As such, single-sex schooling is neither always good nor always bad and
depends on the mechanisms at play in the specific context. This is important for thinking about
how single-sex schools may differ from single-sex classrooms within coed schools. If teachers
have a greater incentive to align instruction to one sex in single-sex schools than in single-sex
classrooms within coed schools, one may see larger benefits to single-sex schools than single-sex
classrooms. In addition, if the direct gender peer interactions in the classroom are affected by the
gender composition of the school, single-sex classrooms may have different effects from that of
single-sex schools. The model does not predict what one may observe in any one situation.
However, it does organize thinking around the effects, and shows that the single-sex effect depends

8

on three key factors; (a) the size and direction of the direct gender peer effects (b) the change in
alignment of instruction between coed and single-sex settings, and (c) the size of the teacher “focus
effect”. After presenting the effects of single-sex schooling in the Trinidad and Tobago context,
Section IV.F employs survey data to present suggestive evidence on mechanisms.

II.

The Trinidad and Tobago Context and the Pilot Program
The Trinidad and Tobago education system evolved from the English system. Secondary

school begins in form 1 (grade 6) and ends at form 5 (grade 10). All the experimental schools
(called pilot schools) are on the main island, Trinidad, which is roughly 50 miles long and 37 miles
wide. All of the pilot schools are government (traditional public) schools. 12 These schools provide
instruction from forms 1 through 5 and teach the national curriculum. Students take two externally
graded exams at the secondary level. These are key outcomes in this study. The first is the National
Certificate of Secondary Education (NCSE) taken at the end of form 3 (grade 8) by all students
(both in public and private schools) in eight subjects. 13 The second exam is the Caribbean
Secondary Education Certification (CSEC) taken at the end of form 5 (grade 10) which is
equivalent to the British Ordinary levels exam. 14 Students seeking to continue their education take
five or more subjects, and all testers take the English language and math exams.
A useful feature of Trinidad and Tobago education system is that the Ministry of Education
(MOE) assigns students to secondary schools. At the end of primary school (after grade 5, typically
at age 11) students take the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) examinations, and each student
12

There are two types of public secondary schools: Government schools and Government Assisted schools (Assisted
schools). Government schools are fully funded and operated by the Government while Assisted schools are run by
private bodies (usually a religious board) and at least half of their expenses are paid for by the Government. Along all
other dimensions, Government and Government Assisted schools are identical. Assisted schools are similar to charter
schools in the United States. Unlike in many countries where private schools are often of higher perceived quality,
private schools in Trinidad and Tobago account for a small share of student enrollment and tend to serve those who
“fall through the cracks” in the public system (roughly 2 percent). Students who attend private secondary schools have
test scores a third of a standard deviation lower than the average 5th grade student does, and half a standard deviation
lower than the average among those students who take the secondary school completion exams.
13
Students are assessed using regular continuous assessments. The students’ final score is a weighted average of
course grades in that subject (submitted by their teachers) and an externally graded exam. The MOE awards certificates
to all students who attain a combined final mark of at least 60% for each of the eight core subjects.
14
There are 31 CSEC subjects covering a range of academic subjects such as Physics and Geography, and vocation
subjects such as Technical Drawing and Principles of Business. The CSEC exams are accepted as an entry
qualification for higher education in Canada, the UK and the United States. After taking the CSEC, students may
continue to take the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations at the end of grade 12, which is considered tertiary
level education but is a prerequisite for admission to the University of the West Indies (the largest University in the
Caribbean). The CAPE is the Caribbean equivalent of the English Advanced Levels (A-Levels) examinations.

lists four ordered high school choices. These choices and their SEA score are used to assign
students to schools using a deferred acceptance algorithm (see Appendix C). This algorithm creates
a test-score cutoff for each school that determines admission to that school in each year. The
variation in school attendance driven by these cutoffs is outside the control of students or parents
and plays a key role in isolating the school effects from selection effects in this study.
II.A.

Description of the Data
This project uses administrative SEA data from 2006 through 2012. These data include

scores on the national examination taken at the end of grade 5, the school choices made by the
student before sitting the SEA exam, and the administrative secondary school assignment. The
data also include age, gender, primary school, and religious affiliation. The final dataset contains
information on 124,382 students across the seven SEA cohorts. The key outcomes under study are
test scores in 8th grade. As such, the SEA data are linked to the NCSE data for 2009 through 2015
by full name and date of birth. 15 The NCSE data contain scores earned on NCSE exams in eight
subjects taken at the end of form 3 (8th grade) when the typical student is 15 years old.
To present evidence on longer-run educational outcomes (including and beyond test
scores), I link the SEA data to the administrative examination data for the 2012 through 2016
CSEC (taken five years after secondary school entry) by name and date of birth. 16 Because the
first treated cohort entered school in 2010 and took the CSEC in 2015, this allows for an analysis
of the CSEC for the first two treated cohorts. The typical student is 17 years old when taking the
CSEC and virtually all students take this exam (in both public and private schools) so that not
taking this test is an excellent measure of high-school dropout. The CSEC data record the subjects
that students decide to take, final grades on the examinations taken, and whether a student earned
a secondary school-leaving credential (i.e. successfully completed high school). A key innovation
of this paper is to study effects on social outcomes. To look at crime, I linked the SEA data by
name and date of birth to official arrest records between January 2000 and February 2015. To track
teen fertility outcomes, I linked the SEA data by name and date of birth to maternal data on all
official birth records from the Registrar General’s office. These data cover all live births between
January 1st 2010 and September 1st 2016.

The match rate of 85 percent is consistent with the national dropout rate of 20 percent by age 17.
The match rate is 80 percent. As expected, this is lower than the match rate for the NCSE (taken two years earlier).

the means and standard deviations of the main variables for boys and girls separately. Roughly
half of the sample is male. On average, 4.8 percent of SEA-takers is a repeat SEA-taker. One
notable pattern is that females outperform males on average. Females score about one-third of a
standard deviation higher than males on the SEA exams at the end of 5th grade, and this gap is
similar for the NCSE exams at the end of 8th grade. 17 Also, by age 17 the dropout rate (i.e. CSEC
nonparticipation) is 0.156 for females compared to 0.229 for males. 18 Dropout rates are even larger
in pilot schools. While 45.6 percent of females in 5th grade earn the secondary school leaving
certificate required for tertiary education entry, only 31.7 percent of males do.
On average, the likelihood that a male is arrested by age 16 and 18 is 3.5 and 7.5 percent,
respectively. The comparable figures for females are 0.7 and 1.4 percent. Arrest rates are higher
at pilot schools. Roughly 4.5 and 10 percent of males at pilot schools before the transition had been
arrested by the age of 16 and 18, respectively. These arrest rates are comparable to those in high
poverty schools in the U.S. (Stevens et al. 2015). The likelihood of a girl having a baby by the age
of 16 and 18 was 0.9 and 4.3 percent, respectively. Teen motherhood rates are higher among girls
at experimental schools where 1.3 and 6.1 percent had a birth by age 16 and 18, respectively. These
teen motherhood rates are similar to those in the United States (Bialik 2009; Kearney and Levine
2012). These figures paint a picture of male underperformance at all schools, and
underperformance (both academically and socially) at pilot schools for both sexes.
II.B.

The Pilot Program
The MOE noticed that students who attended elite single-sex schools (studied in Jackson

2012) tended to have good outcomes, and thus decided to experiment with single-sex education.
In March of 2010, the MOE identified 20 low-performing coed government schools to transition
to single-sex starting in September 2010 (there were 90 government schools in the country at the
time). These 20 experimental schools (called pilot schools) were selected in pairs. One school in
each pair was converted to all-girls and the other to all-boys. All these decisions were made by the
MOE without the approval or consultation of the schools. 19 These 20 pilot schools were to be
converted on a phased basis (with each successive incoming cohort) to single-sex over a period of
17
The gender gap is larger for English, Spanish, and social studies where females score about half a standard deviation
above males and smallest for physical education where females outperform males by 0.12sd. Females outperform
males on average in all subjects, but the relative male underperformance is greater in language and humanities subjects.
18
These high school completion numbers are comparable to those in the United States in 2012.
19
There has harsh been criticism of this initiative, particularly from the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers
Association. They argued that there was not prior consultation and there was insufficient time for proper preparation.

five years. Commencing with the 2010 SEA placement process, all incoming 6th-grade students
at pilot schools were of the same sex. To avoid disrupting the incumbent students, students who
were previously admitted to coed cohorts remained in coed cohorts, while those admitted after the
transition were admitted to single-sex cohorts. This phased cohort-level transition was to continue
until all pilot schools were single-sex in all grades. 20
The pilot schools were chosen based on three criteria. Each pilot school had to be (1) nonselective, (2) a traditional government school (as opposed to a government Assisted school—i.e.
a charter school), and (3) close to another potential pilot school of similar selectivity and size. This
last condition was necessary because each school in a pilot pair of schools would need to take in
half of the students who would have attended the other school in the pair. To demonstrate that the
selection of pilot schools followed the stated MOE criteria, Figure 1 plots the likelihood of being
a pilot school for different groups of schools by the distance to the nearest government school. 21
As shown in Figure 1, only non-selective traditional government schools were chosen for the pilot.
Among these, the likelihood of being a pilot is strongly associated with being close to another
government school. 22 In sum, pilot school status was involuntary, and the MOE selected pilot
schools based on known criteria. As such, one can be confident that pilot schools were not chosen
based on a trajectory of improving or worsening outcomes. Consistent with this, I show that the
effect of attending pilot schools did not exhibit any differential pre-trending in Section IV.

20

In 2010, the 6th graders were in single-sex classes, while grades 7 through 10 were in coed classes. In 2011, the new
incoming 6th graders and the 7th graders were single-sex, while earlier cohorts (now in grades 8 through 10) were in
coed classes. However, In 2013 there was a change in government, there was growing frustration from the teachers’
union that they were never consulted on the transition, and single-sex pilot was abandoned. In 2013, the Ministry of
Education announced that the incoming 6th graders in 2014 would be coed. Appendix B presents the status of each
grade in pilot school by year. Note that because I study outcomes several years after secondary school entry, the end
of the pilot program occurs after secondary school entry of youngest cohort examined in this study.
21
I obtained address data for each secondary school in Trinidad and Tobago, geocoded each address, and computed
the shortest distance (as the crow flies) between each secondary school and the closest government school. Addresses
were obtained from a variety of sources: contacting individual schools, school websites, and official databases with
school information. Addresses were geocoded using the reported longitude and latitudes from google maps. In a few
cases street addresses could not be geocoded so that area centroids and street mid points were used.
22
Among non-selective traditional government schools, over 40 percent of those that were within one kilometer of
another government school were chosen as pilot sites, and none more than 2.5 kilometers from a government school
was. In a regression, school type, school selectivity, and distance “explains” over half of the variation in pilot school
status. One may wonder why these variables do not “explain” all of the variation. One reason is that the distance
calculations are based on as the crow flies and my geocoding was not 100 percent accurate. These factors introduce
measurement error and reduce the explained variation. A second reason is that some schools that were close to a
government school and non-selective were a different size from the closest school – making the transition less feasible.
Third, some schools are clustered such that at times three schools are closer to each other but only two schools (one
pair) could be chosen for the pilot. Finally, because the MOE wished to have pilot schools in different areas where
several schools were clustered closer to each other only two (one pair) would be chosen for the pilot.

III.

Empirical Framework
The transition policy caused pilot schools (T=1) to go from coed in the pre-period (Post=0)

to single-sex in the post period (Post=1). Comparison schools (T=0) remained coed in both periods.
I lay out an empirical framework that defines the parameter of interest, describes how it can be
identified in the current context, and discusses how it relates to existing estimates in the literature.
I model outcome Yij of student i at school j as below.
(4)

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = (𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃)𝜎𝜎 + 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜋𝜋 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

In (4), Tj is equal to 1 if the student attends a pilot school and zero otherwise, Post is equal to 1 in
the post-transition period and zero otherwise, θj, is a school fixed-effect, Xij is a matrix of studentlevel covariates, and εij is a random error term. The parameter of interest, σ, is the marginal effect
of attending a pilot school during the post-transition period relative to the pre-transition period.
This is the effect of introducing single-sex education, net of student selection effects, and holding
other school inputs (e.g. teacher quality) fixed – i.e. the causal effect of single-sex education. As I
explain below, unlike that identified in existing studies, this is the policy-relevant parameter that
captures the change in school effectiveness caused by the adoption of single-sex instruction.
The naive approach to uncovering σ has been to rely on variation across schools at a given
point in time to estimate the effect of attending a single-sex school. To see what this basic crosssectional comparison identifies, consider the conditional expectation of the difference in outcomes
between observationally similar students who are in single-sex and coed environments in the post
period because they attend different schools in (5) below.
(5)

𝐸𝐸(𝜎𝜎�𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ) ≡ 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 1]−𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 1] ≡ 𝜎𝜎 + 𝐸𝐸�∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 � + 𝐸𝐸[∆𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ] .

This estimate reflects the true single-sex effect, σ , plus unobserved school-level differences that
exist between single-sex and coed schools 𝐸𝐸[∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 ] ≡ 𝐸𝐸[𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 |𝑇𝑇 = 1] − 𝐸𝐸[𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 |𝑇𝑇 = 0], plus a selection
term 𝐸𝐸[∆𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ] ≡ 𝐸𝐸[𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 1] − 𝐸𝐸[𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 1]. Because (a) students are not
randomly assign to schools, and (b) schools do not become single-sex at random, 𝐸𝐸(𝜎𝜎�𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ) ≠ 𝜎𝜎.

In recognition of this identification problem, a recent literature has emerged that relies on

plausibly exogenous variation across schools (e.g. Jackson 2012, Park et al 2013, Lee et al 2016)
such that the selection term is equal to zero in expectation (i.e. 𝐸𝐸�∆𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � = 0). These studies
compare outcomes of students who are similar in both observed and unobserved dimensions who

are in single-sex and coed environments because they attend different schools. Again, using only

13

the post transition data, this cross-school selection-free estimate, 𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , is such that
(6)

𝐸𝐸�𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 � ≡ 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 1]−𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 1] ≡ 𝜎𝜎 + 𝐸𝐸[∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 ] .

In (6) the selection free cross-school estimates capture the causal effect of attending a
single-sex school relative to a coed school. 23 However, such estimates do not identify the
parameter of interest, σ , unless 𝐸𝐸�∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 � = 0. That is, if there are unobserved school-level

differences across single-sex and coed schools, these studies, while they convincingly address the
selection problem, will not identify the policy-relevant parameter of interest, σ , the causal effect

of single-sex education all else equal.
To address this concern, I rely on the fact that the pilot program allows one to observe the
same schools under both single-sex and coed regimes at different points in time (or for different
cohorts). 24 My approach exploits exogenous variation across the same schools both pre and post
transition (where some schools change single-sex status over time). This allows me to remove both
the selection bias, and bias due to unobserved school-level attributes. I detail this approach below.
Consider using the same exogenous cross-sectional variation used to estimate
𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , (the selection-free difference between pilot and non-pilot schools), but estimating
this cross-school difference in the pre-transition period, when all schools are coed. As before, the
selection term is equal to zero, and there are unobserved school-level differences that exist between
pilot and non-pilot schools, 𝐸𝐸�∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 �. However, now there is no single-sex schooling effect.

Specifically, the resulting selection-free cross-school estimate in the pre-period is
(7)

𝐸𝐸�𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 � ≡ 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 0]−𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 0, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 0] ≡ 𝐸𝐸�∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 �.

The selection-free estimate in the pre-period captures the difference in school
characteristics across pilot and non-pilot schools (𝐸𝐸(𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ) = 𝐸𝐸�∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 �). The selection-free
estimate in the post-period captures the single-sex schooling effect plus the difference in schoollevel characteristics between pilot and non-pilot schools (𝐸𝐸(𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ) = 𝜎𝜎 + 𝐸𝐸�∆𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 �). It
follows that, in expectation, the change in the selection-free estimate after transition to single-sex

yields the single-sex schooling effect (that is, E(𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ) = 𝜎𝜎). I detail
23

This is of interest to parents and children who are deciding between single sex and coeducational school. However,
it is not the policy effect of expanding single sex education. Both are of interest, but are not the same.
24
One could compare post-transition students in single-sex classrooms to pre-transition coed students within the same
school –holding school level differences constant. While such an approach will remove school-level differences, it
does not address the selection problem because 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 1]−𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑇𝑇 = 1, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 0] = 𝜎𝜎 + �∆𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � ≠ 𝜎𝜎.

14

below how I use the MOE’s school assignment mechanism to remove selection in both pre and
post transition cohorts to facilitate the difference-in-difference type estimate outlined above.
III.A. Student Assignment to Secondary Schools
At the end of primary school (5th grade), students take the Secondary Entrance Assessment
(SEA) exams. Before the exams, students submit a list of four ordered school secondary school
choices. The exams are sent to the Ministry of Education (MOE) where they are externally scored.
The test score and the school choices are used by the MOE to assign students to secondary schools
using a deferred acceptance algorithm (Gayle and Shapley 1962). 25 This algorithm creates a test
score cutoff for each government school above which applicants are admitted, and above which
they are not (Jackson 2010, 2012, 2014). However, there is not full compliance with the cutoffs
because the MOE makes administrative assignments in certain circumstances. 26 Importantly, the
noncompliance in school assignments is due to MOE adjustments that are outside the control of
parents and students. As such, one can use the cutoffs to estimate a selection-free effect of
attending a pilot school using a fuzzy-regression-discontinuity-type design.
The cutoffs for each school are not reported by the MOE. However, because I have access
to the administrative assignment (which is outside the control of the students or their parents),
there are real cutoffs that were used to assign students, and any non-compliance with the cutoffs
are orthogonal to students’ attributes, the cutoffs can be recovered empirically. For each of the 20
pilot schools, I regress whether an applicant is assigned to the school by the MOE on an indicator
variable denoting scoring above each possible test score. 27 I select the cutoff that yields the largest
F-statistic to be the cutoff for that school. If one used the actual schools attended, one might worry
that this empirical approach would result in endogenous cutoffs. However, this approach uses the
MOE assignment and not the actual school attended to infer the location of the cutoffs.
To show that this procedure closely approximates where the actual cutoffs likely were, the
top panel of Figure 2 shows the likelihood of receiving the administrative assignment to pilot
school A (the school’s name is confidential) as a function of applicants’ incoming SEA scores in
2009 (the year before the transition) and 2010 (the year after the transition). The dashed vertical
25

For full details on how students are assigned to schools see Appendix C.
For example, students who score below the cutoffs for all the schools in their choices receive an MOE assignment
that may not comply with the cutoffs. Also, when schools are forced to restrict capacity for unforeseen reasons (e.g.
one school was closed down for a year due to fire and another could not open due to flooding), students receive
administrative assignments to accommodate these circumstances.
27
Note: An applicant to a school listed that school in their choices and was not already assigned to a preferred school.

line indicates the estimated cutoff. It is clear that in this school the administrative assignments
follow the cutoff rules virtually all the time. As such, it is clear where the cutoff was for this school
in both years. However, the MOE did not assign all students to schools using the cutoff rules in all
years. To show this, the lower panel presents the likelihood of attending a different pilot school B
in 2008 and 2011. Even though the MOE assignments were not in full compliance with the cutoffs
for this school in these specific years, within a relatively small range of values, the location of the
cutoffs is easily inferred from the data. While some schools’ assignments are better approximated
by the cutoff rule than others (as shown in Figure 2), all key results are robust to only using cutoffs
that explain more than seventy percent of the variation in the administrative assignments.
III.B. Identification Strategy
The strategy to remove selection to schools within each cohort is to use the cutoffs
described above in a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) type design. As shown in in Figure 2,
among students who chose a pilot school in a given year, the likelihood of being assigned to a pilot
school increases in a discontinuous manner as one’s score goes from below to above the cutoff for
that pilot school. If the locations of the cutoffs are orthogonal to student characteristics, and the
effect of test scores on outcomes are smooth through the cutoffs, one can attribute any sudden
jumps in outcomes through the cutoffs to the suddenly increased likelihood of being assigned to,
and therefore attending, a pilot school in a given year. To isolate the effect of transitioning from
coed to single-sex from other school attributes, I (a) use the cutoffs in pre-transition years to obtain
an RD estimate of the causal effect of attending a pilot school prior to the transition (𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ),

(b) use the cutoffs in post-transition years to obtain an RD estimate of the causal effect of attending

a pilot school after the transition (𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ), and then (c) use these two RD estimates to

compute the change in relative effectiveness of pilot schools after the transition – i.e. the single-

sex schooling effect (𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 -𝜎𝜎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = 𝜎𝜎). The proposed estimator of the single-sex
schooling effects is a difference-in-regression-discontinuity (DiRD) design.

The validity of the DiRD approach requires that the RD identifying assumptions be
satisfied (i.e. smoothness of potential outcomes through the cutoff), and also that the DiD
identifying assumptions be satisfied (i.e. common trends between treatment and comparison
schools and no other changes at pilot schools). However, the DiRD design has the additional
assumption that, in expectation, the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of the pilot school

16

effect is the same before and after the transition. 28 In section IV.C, I discuss possible violations of
these assumptions and I present evidence that each of these sets of assumption is likely satisfied.
Because students apply to four schools, students can be used to identify multiple cutoffs.
For example, a student may be above the cutoff for their third choice school, but below the cutoff
for their second and first choice schools. To exploit the fact that each student can be used to identify
the effect of multiple cutoffs, following Jackson (2010), each student is in the dataset once for each
cutoff for which they are marginal. Students are marginal for a school’s cutoff if they applied to
that school and were not already admitted to a more preferred school. 29 While the data contain
124,382 students, the analytic dataset contains 366,536 student-by-cutoff observations.
This DiRD estimate is obtained by the two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) model below where
equation (8) is the second-stage equation and (9) and (10) are first-stage equations.

All common variables are defined as in (4). 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the outcome of person i, applying to

school j in SEA cohort c. Let P be the set of all j’s that are pilot schools. Aboveij is an indicator
equal to 1 if student i applied to, and scored above the cutoff for, school j. The variable 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∈𝑃𝑃

is an indicator equal to 1 if school j is a pilot school, student i applied to pilot school j, and student
i scored above the cutoff for pilot school j. Postic is an indicator equal to 1 if student i in cohort c
took the SEA in 2010 or thereafter. All SEA cohorts admitted to pilot schools after 2010 (i.e.
Post=1) are single-sex. To ensure that all comparisons are among students who apply to the same

school in the same year, the model includes cutoff fixed effects, 𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 .

The endogenous regressors are attending a pilot school, 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and attending a pilot school

after the transition, 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . To remove selection bias, I instrument for these two endogenous

regressors with both scoring above the cutoff for a pilot school (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∈𝑃𝑃 ) and also scoring above
28

If the LATE is not the same before and after the transition then then one could not simply “difference out” the pilot
school effect between the two RD estimates and the DiRD estimates would be biased. The LATE could vary over time
due to changes in the marginal student or changes in the counterfactual schools. I discuss this in Section IV.C.
29
That is, students assigned to their top choice school are in the dataset once for the cutoff of their top choice school.
Students assigned to their second choice school are in the dataset twice (once for the top choice and once for the
second choice). Students assigned to their third choice school are in the dataset three times (once for each of the top,
second, and third choice). Finally, students who were either assigned to their fourth choice school or received an
administrative assignment are in the data four times (once for each choice).

17

the cutoff for a pilot school interacted with being in the 2010 SEA cohort or later (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∈𝑃𝑃 ×

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). Because it is important to model the smoothness of outcomes through the test score
cutoffs, the incoming student characteristics Xij include a fourth-order polynomial of incoming

SEA scores. Because the model includes the estimated effect of attending a pilot school across all
�
years, the coefficient on (𝑇𝑇𝚥𝚥 ×
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝚤𝚤 ) identifies the parameter of interest 𝜎𝜎 – the causal effect of
the change in the effectiveness of pilot schools after the transition to single-sex.

If the RD identifying assumptions are valid, the assignments based on the cutoffs are
exogenous conditional on test scores and cutoff fixed effects. I present evidence of this in Section
IV. However, the student choice fixed effects, 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 , serve as powerful additional controls. The

choice fixed effect denotes the unique combination and order of the four school choices during the
pre and post period. As such, all comparisons are made among students who chose the same set of
schools in the exact same order during the same regime (i.e. pre or post transition). 30 This accounts
for differences in preferences and other attributes that predict parental decisions of where to send
their children, but are typically not observed by researchers. Standard errors are clustered at the
assigned school level (which is a larger group than the individual student).
III.C. Illustrating the DiRD Variation Visually
The DiRD estimate is the difference between fuzzy-RD estimates obtained before and after
the transition. Figure 3 presents the first stage for all the pilot schools combined. 31 The figure

shows the likelihood of attending a pilot school during the pre-transition years on the left and the
post-transition years on the right, as a function of applicants’ scores relative to the cutoff. The
figure shows data for test scores within one standard deviation (29 points) of the cutoff. The figure
includes the 95% confidence interval of a model that fits the data with a fourth-order polynomial
of the relative score and an “above cutoff” indicator. The coefficient on “above cutoff” is presented
along with the p-value for the null hypothesis of no shift through the cutoff. For both the pre and
the post years, there is a visible shift in the likelihood of attending a pilot school through the cutoff
(a relative score of 0). The increase in likelihood of attending a pilot school is 41 and 63 percentage

30
For example students who chose schools A,B,C, and D are in a different group from those who list B,A,C, and D.
Moreover, students who chose who chose schools A,B,C, and D before 2010 are in a different group than those who
chose schools A,B,C, and D after 2010.
31
Following Pop-Eleches and Urqiula (2013) and Jackson (2010), I show multiple cutoffs in a single graph by taking
the applicants for each pilot school in each year (140 cutoffs; 20 schools over 7 years), re-centering their SEA scores
around the cutoff for that school in that year and then stacking the data for each cutoff.

18

points in the pre and post-transition periods, respectively (both t-statistics are above 100).
To illustrate the mechanics of the DiRD estimate, Figure 4 shows the analogous figure for
the change in 8th-grade math scores through the same cutoffs. To present variation conditional on
the choice fixed effects, I regress math scores on the choice fixed effects, and then take the residual
8th-grade test scores from this model. The left figure shows that math scores are -0.082sd lower
through the cutoff for the pre-transition period (p-value<0.01), so that scoring above the cutoff for
a pilot school in the pre-period is associated with a 41 percentage point increase is pilot school
attendance and 0.082sd lower math scores. Using this discontinuity variation, the Wald estimate
of the pilot school effect is -0.082÷0.41= -0.2sd in the pre period. The right figure shows that math
scores are only 0.007sd lower through the cutoff for the post-transition period (p-value>0.1), so
that scoring above the cutoff for a pilot school in the post period is associated with a 63 percentage
point increase in pilot school attendance and 0.007sd lower math scores. The Wald estimate of the
pilot school effect is -0.007÷0.63 = -0.012sd in the post period. The DiRD estimate is the difference
between the RD effect in the post period (which includes the single-sex effect and school effects)
and that for the pre-period (which includes only school effects) which is -0.012+0.2= 0.18sd. In
words, the causal effect of attending a pilot school relative to a comparison school on math test
scores increased by 0.18sd after the transition to single-sex compared to before. Figures 3 and 4
present a visual representation, of the DiRD variation used in the 2SLS model outlined above.

IV.

Main Results
Before presenting the regression results, it is helpful to discuss the raw differences in 8th-

grade math scores before and after the transition (not presented in the table). While these raw
differences will not yield causal estimates from a student’s perspective, they do represent the
average change in outcomes observed by teachers and policymakers at pilot schools. Average math
scores increased by 0.3sd at schools that transitioned to all-girls (p-value<0.01), and fell by 0.29sd
at schools that transitioned to all-boys (p-value<0.01). Given the large average difference in math
scores between girls and boys, these differences likely reflect a gender composition effect rather
than the effect of the transition per se. However, such patterns led to a perceived failure of the pilot
intervention (particularly for the boy’s schools). The extent to which these raw correlations reflect
the causal effect of the transition on affected students is explored below.
I now turn to regression results that attempt to uncover causal relationships. Because not
19

all students who took the SEA are linked to NCSE data, the main math test score outcome is the
math score conditional on taking the NCSE exams. Across all models and for both boys and girls,
there is no statistically significant relationship between taking the NCSE exams and attending a
pilot school after the transition. As such, there is likely no composition bias when estimating math
score effects on the sample of NCSE takers. 32 In Section IV.A. I present results that account for
the NCSE participation margin explicitly. The main conclusions are unchanged in such analyses.
Table 2 presents the main regression results. Each column represents a different
econometric specification, and each of the 18 models represents a point estimates from a separate
regression. The coefficient on “Boys-Pilot*POST” is the estimated change in the effectiveness of
pilot schools after the transition to all-boys, the coefficient on “Girl-Pilot*POST” is the estimated
change in the effectiveness of pilot schools after the transition to all-girls, and the coefficient on
“Pilot*POST” is the estimated change in the effectiveness of pilot schools after the transition to
either all-boys or all-girls. I discuss the effect for the boys and girls in turn.
To assess the possibility that the large negative raw transition effect for the all-boys pilot
schools represents a gender composition effect, model 1 presents the same raw comparisons only
for boys (i.e. no controls, but only among boys). This regression model reveals that about half of
the raw differences were simply a gender composition effect, and after the transition boys scored
0.146sd lower on the math NCSE exams than before (p-value<0.01). However, this negative effect
among boys above may still reflect a difference in composition rather than a causal effect per se if
those boys who attended pilot schools after the transition had lower incoming scores. Model 2
presents results that control for students’ incoming test scores. The estimated transition effect for
boys goes from negative to positive – indicative of negative selection to the all-boys pilot schools
after the transition. One would expect individual SEA scores to remove much self-selection bias.
Despite this, OLS without choices may still be biased because students may know more about their
ability and aspirations beyond their SEA scores, which may be noisy. Adding student choices
should remove this bias. Model 3 presents results from models that condition on both incoming
scores and choices. In this richer model that addresses student selection on observables, boys at
pilot schools after the transition scored 0.09sd higher than those before (p-value<0.1).

32

In OLS models the estimated effect of the transition to single-sex on taking the NCSE is -0.0073 (p-value=0.60). In
2SLS models, the coefficient is -0.0273 (p-value=0.26). Broken up by sex, the 2SLS model for the transition to all
girls is 0.0011 (p-value= 0.98) and that for the transition to all-boys is 0.046 (p-value=0.38).

20

To address bias due to selection in unobserved dimensions, model 4 presents the 2SLS
models that isolate exogenous variation in school attendance due only to a students’ score relative
to that of the test score cutoffs of pilot schools. Note that this model includes fixed effects for each
cutoff in addition to fixed effects for the student choices. The first stage F-statistics for all
endogenous regressors are well above 100 so that there is no weak identification problem. This
2SLS model yields an all-boys transition effect of 0.334 (p-value<0.05). The estimated all-boys
effect is large, but the 95% confidence interval includes a range of modest and large effects;
between 0.004sd and 0.66sd. The fact that the 2SLS estimate is more positive than the OLS
estimates is consistent with the general pattern that as one accounts for more sources of selection,
the estimated transition effect becomes more positive for the all-boys schools.
The central innovation of this paper is to account for school-level characteristics that may
be correlated with single-sex schools in cross-sectional analyses. This is accomplished by
exploiting within-school variation in single-sex status over time. To show the importance of this,
model 5 shows the estimated single-sex schooling effect for the post-transition cohorts only (i.e.
using only the cross-school variation). The estimated single-sex school effect for boys is negative
(-0.0958) and is not statistically significantly different from zero. That it, if one were simply to
rely on the cross-sectional variation and ignored the possibility that single-sex status is not
randomly distributed across schools, one would wrongly infer that all-boys education had no effect
on student outcomes or possibly made outcomes worse. This stands in stark contrast to the more
credible within-school results. This demonstrates how relying on cross-school variation (even if it
is clean) confounds single-sex status with other school-level differences, and may be very
misleading about the causal effect of single-sex education per se.
I now discuss the math test score results for girls. Unlike the negative raw naïve transition
effect for all-boys pilot schools, performance at all-girl pilot schools was better after the move to
all-girls. Roughly, half of this naïve effect was a gender composition effect. In models that only
compare girls with girls, the transition estimate falls to 0.143 (p-value<0.01) so that outcomes for
girls at schools that transitioned to all-girls were better after the transition than before. Unlike for
boys, girls at the pilot schools after the transition had similar incoming scores to those before.
Consistent with this, adding incoming student test scores (Model 8) has no economically
meaningful effect on the estimated effect. The model that conditions on both incoming test scores
and student choices (Model 9) shows that girls who attended pilot schools after the transition
21

scored 0.161sd higher than observationally similar girls did at pilot schools before the transition.
These effects are surprisingly similar to those that include no controls. Model 10 presents the 2SLS
model that isolates exogenous variation in school attendance due only to the test score cutoffs
conditional on school choices. The 2SLS model yields a transition effect of 0.147 (p-value<0.1).
This is on the same order of magnitude as the estimated all-boys effect, and formal tests fail to
reject the hypothesis that the effects are equal. Both naïve comparisons and models that are more
credible indicate positive all-girls effects on test scores between 0.09 and 0.18sd. While the
magnitude of the effects varies across models, the positive all-girls effects is a robust finding.
Because one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the all-girls transition effects is the same
as the all-boys transition (p-value=0.58), models 13 through 18 present the transition effect for
boys and girls combined. In models with controls for incoming test scores and school choices, the
point estimate is 0.12 (p-value<0.01). In the full 2SLS model (Model 16), the coefficient is 0.227
(p-value<0.05). Taken together, on average, boys and girls who attended pilot schools after the
transition scored between 0.12sd and 0.227sd higher than similar girls and boys at pilot schools
before the transition. The 95 percent confidence interval for the preferred 2SLS estimated effect is
between 0.02sd and 0.43sd, and the point estimate is very similar to that implied by the simple
Wald estimate discussed in Section III.C. In sum, across all models, that address composition and
selection bias, there is a positive single-sex transition effect for both boys and girls on average.
IV.A. Distributional Effects
One may wonder if the improved average outcomes documented above are due to
improvements among students at the upper end of the achievement distribution, or among students
at the bottom, or due to a change in the composition of NCSE test takers. To test for this, I put
each student’s math score into a test score quintile (across all years), and I estimate the 2SLS
models (on all students) where the outcome is an indicator variable denoting taking the NCSE and
scoring at each quintile. 33 I present the coefficient estimates for boys and girls in Table 3.
The top panel presents the marginal effects for math scores. The outcome in the first
column is an indicator for taking the NCSE math exam. For boys, the point estimate is 0.046 and
is not statistically significant at traditional levels – suggesting that changes in sample composition
do not drive the results in Table 2. Looking at performance on the test, the math gains for boys are

33

Because the NCSE is designed to test the same skills every year and are scored the same way every year, I define
the test score quartiles pooling all the years of data.

22

driven by improvements across the achievement distribution. After the transition, boys were 16.3
percentage points less likely to be in the bottom quintile (p-value<0.05). Most of this reduction in
the proportion of low-scoring boys is accounted for by a 10.4 percentage-point increase in the
proportion scoring in the top 80 percent of the distribution (p-value<0.05). While the point
estimates are both positive, there are no statistically significant changes in the proportion of boys
scoring in the second or third quintile. However, boys after the transition are 5.46 percentage points
more likely to be in the top quintile (p-value<0.05). The large improvements in average math
scores for males are driven primarily by having fewer students with low scores (in the bottom
20%) and more students scoring at the top of the test score distribution (in the top 20%).
For girls, the estimated effect on having missing NCSE data is a tiny -0.000967 and is not
statistically significant – further indication that compositional change does not drive the results. In
contrast to the boys, the patterns for girls suggest that the average gains are due to improvements
primarily at the top of the achievement distribution with little effect at the bottom. The estimated
effect on scoring in the bottom 20 percent is -0.0341 and that for scoring between the 21st percentile
and the 40th percentile is 0.0299. Neither effect is statistically significant, but they suggest that
there may have been a small upward shift of about three percentage points from the bottom 20
percent to the second quintile. The two point estimates that are statistically significant indicate a
10.5 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of scoring between the 41st and 60th percentiles
(p-value<0.05), and an identical and opposite increase in the likelihood of scoring in the top 20
percent (p-value<0.01). These patterns suggest a shifting of girls from the middle of the
achievement distribution to the top of the distribution. Overall, single-sex education appears to
have improved outcomes throughout the achievement distribution for boys, and led to the most
pronounced improvements among the ablest girls.
IV.B. Effects on Other Subjects
To illustrate the nature of the variation, the analysis thus far has focused on math scores.
However, students take several subjects for NCSE certification. This allows for an exploration of
the effects of single-sex schooling on a broad set of subjects. Table 4 presents the estimated 2SLS
single-sex effect in academic subjects (Math, English, Spanish, Science, Social Studies) and
nonacademic subjects (Arts, Physical Education, Technology). Looking at the combined singlesex transition effect (top panel), the point estimate for each of the eight subjects is positive and
economically meaningful. However, the effects are only statistically significant in Math (0.22sd),
23

Spanish (0.243sd), Social studies (0.312sd) and technology (0.395sd). Together, this pattern
echoes the positive math score effects and suggests that, on average, the transition had a positive
effect of about 0.2sd on student test scores across all subjects.
The theory suggests that because teachers may align instruction to boys in some subjects
and girls in others, there could be some differences in the transition effects across subjects by sex.
To explore this possibility, the middle panel (models 9 through 16) presents the effects for boys,
and the lower panel (models 17 through 24) presents the effects for girls. For boys, the transition
effect is positive in all subjects, and statistically significant in Math, Spanish, Social Studies, Arts,
and Technology. The results for boys are consistent with an across the board improvement in test
scores of about 0.3sd. Indeed, for none of the subjects can one reject that the real effect is 0.3 at
traditional levels of statistical significance. Contrary to some hypotheses regarding the effect of
single-sex schooling, there is no tendency for the all-boys effect to be any larger or smaller in more
male-dominated subjects, or in subjects in which male tend to underperform historically.
The results for females in the lower panel are more nuanced than those for boys. The point
estimates are positive in some subjects and negative in others. The only two statistically significant
point estimates are a positive effect on Math scores and a large negative effect on Arts scores. If
one takes the average across all subjects as the dependent variable, the transition effect is a positive
but statistically insignificant 0.07. The large and highly statistically significant effect on scoring
in the top quartile of the math distribution (p-value<0.01) and the large statistically significant
negative effect in arts scores is not consistent with the same effect in all subjects.
To explore these patterns further, I put the average of all academic subjects into quintiles
and the average across all subjects into quintiles to explore effect across the distribution of average
scores overall and average scores in academic courses. This analysis mirrors that in Section IV.A,
and is presented in the lower two panels of Table 3. Looking at the average of the academic
subjects, for both boys and girls, the transition increased the proportion of students scoring in the
top 20 percent of the achievement distribution by roughly 6 percentage points (both are significant
at the 1 percent level). For both boys and girls, this increase at the top appears to have come from
reductions in the proportion scoring in the middle quintile. There are no statistically significant
effects at other quintiles, suggesting that after the transition, both boys and girls who would have
been in the middle of the achievement distribution were more likely to have high average
performance in academic subjects than before.
24

The lower panel presents effects on scoring at various point in the distribution of overall
scores (across all subjects). Consistent with the positive effects across all subjects for boys, there
is a statistically significant eight percentage-point increase in scoring in the top 20 percent. In
contrast, there is no statistically significant change in the proportion of girls scoring at any quintile
of overall scores after the transition to all-girls. This indicates that females after the transition
perform better in academic subjects and worse in the non-academic subjects. Overall, the results
reveal a robust positive test score effect for boys across most subjects. For girls the results suggest
improved outcomes in academic subjects and worse outcomes in non-academic subjects. While
speculative, this pattern of results suggests that girls may have had a more academic orientation
after the transition to all-girls, while boys experienced a general increase in scholarly engagement.
The results in Section IV.D on high school completion (which is achieved by those at the top of
the academic achievement distribution) are consistent with this interpretation.
IV.C. Specification Checks and Tests of Validity
As discussed in Section III, the DiRD model requires that the RD identifying assumptions
are valid, the DiD identifying assumptions are valid, and the DiRD identifying assumption is valid.
I summarize tests of these assumptions here (see Appendix D for a fuller discussion). All of the
specification checks described below indicate that the DiRD estimates can be interpreted causally.
Testing the Regression Discontinuity Identifying Assumptions
For the RD design to be valid there should be no gaming of the cutoffs, and outcomes must
vary smoothly through the cutoffs. One diagnostic for gaming is to test for non-smoothness in
density through the cutoff. Such tests reveal no change in density through the cutoffs (appendix
Figure D1). To test for smoothness in outcomes through cutoffs, one can test for smoothness of
latent outcomes (as predicted by covariates) through cutoffs. I find that predicted outcomes (i.e.
fitted values from a regression of math scores on repeater status in 5th grade, religion, primary
school fixed effects, selectivity of each secondary school choice, age at sitting the SEA, and month
of birth) vary smoothly through the cutoffs (see models 6, 12 and 18 in Table 2).
Testing the Difference-in-Difference Identifying Assumptions
For the DiRD estimates to represent the causal effect of single-sex education requires that
there were no changes in the pilot schools that coincided with the pilot program. Confounding
changes within schools is unlikely because, (a) schools had no control over pilot status, (b) the
MOE stipulated that no other changes take place in pilot schools, and (c) schools had little time to
25

react to the pilot school announcement before the start of the school year. Even so, one may worry
that pilot schools were already improving prior to transition. To test for this, Figure 5 shows the
RD estimates for attending a pilot school for each year three years before and three years after the
transition on math scores. Each data point is an RD point estimate. The 90 percent confidence
interval is presented for each estimate. The figure also presents 90 percent confidence interval of
the regression fit where the mean outcomes for the pre and post transition are pooled across
individual years (as in the actual regression models). The RD estimates for 2007 through 2009
hover around -0.13, and there is no indication of an upward trend at pilot schools prior to the
transition. Consistent with the positive single-sex effects for boys and girls, the pilot school effects
in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are higher than in the pre-treatment years and hover around 0.08. The
difference between the RD estimates pre and post transition indicates that the transition increased
the pilot school effect by roughly 0.13+0.08=0.21sd —in line with Table 2.
Even though the MOE stipulated that there be no changes, as a final check on the DiD
assumptions of no other changes, I supplement the testing data with survey data on a sample of
teachers at all schools available for the years 2009 and 2013. 34 In a difference-in-difference
regression model (Appendix Table D1), I find no evidence of systematic changes in teacher gender,
teacher age, teacher education, or school cohort sizes after the transition to single-sex at pilot
schools. These results support the MOE’s claim that there were no other changes at pilot schools.
Testing the Additional DiRD Identifying Assumption
Even if the RD identifying assumptions and the DiD assumptions are both satisfied, for the
DiRD strategy to uncover the transition effects requires that the Local Average Treatment Effects
(LATE) identified in the pre-period and the post-period for pilot schools be the same. There are
two ways that this condition could be violated. I discuss, and test for, each below.
The first way this could be violated is if the marginal applicants to pilot schools changed
after the transition in a specific way. That is, if the students who were at the cutoffs after the
transition benefited more from attending pilot schools than those before, due to treatment
heterogeneity it would appear that the transition increased the effectiveness of pilot schools. 35 As
34

Ideally, one would have administrative data on individual teacher that can be linked over time to track turnover and
classroom placements more closely. Unfortunately, such data are not available.
35
Figure 5 provides evidence that this does not drive the results. The RD estimate is similar for the 2010 and 2012
cohorts. While the 2012 cohort made their school choices with full knowledge of the transition, students in the 2010
cohort who were assigned to a pilot school were automatically assigned to the sister/brother school in each pair that
matched their sex. As such, the applicants to the pilot schools in 2009 and 2010 should have been more similar than

26

documented in Appendix E, the applicants to pilot schools did change after the transitions so that
this is an important scenario to rule out. 36 To test for this empirically, I estimate models that
explicitly account for pilot-school treatment heterogeneity in a variety of ways, and see if this
changes the estimated single-sex transition effect. To do this, I interact attending a pilot school (in
any year) with various observed student characteristics. These include incoming test scores, the
number of single-sex schools in the student’s choices (a good measure of preferences for single
sex education), the selectivity of schools in the student choices (based on the average SEA scores
of admits), the selectivity of their primary school, whether the primary school was single-sex, and
predicted math scores (based on repeater status in 5th grade, age when taking the SEA, religion,
primary school fixed effects, and month of birth). Figure 6 presents the single-sex transition effect
in models that account for pilot-school treatment heterogeneity in these various dimensions
(models 1 through 8). In all models, the single-sex effect is very similar to the main model.
The second way the LATE could be different after the transition than before is if the schools
that students list just below the pilot school (i.e. the counterfactual school) tended to be worse after
the transition than before. I test this in two ways. First, I compute the percentile rank of all schools
in incoming SEA scores and test for whether the percentile ranking of the school listed just below
the pilot school (among pilot school applicants) were worse after the transition. Reassuringly,
among individuals within one standard deviation of the cutoff for a pilot school, the selectivity of
the next ranked school is unchanged after the transition. 37 It is also helpful to see that the estimates
are robust to accounting for the selectivity of the next ranked school explicitly. To do this I estimate
a model that interacts pilot school attendance with the selectivity of the next ranked school (models
9 and 10 in Figure 6). As expected, the estimated single-sex transition effect is unchanged in such
models. Given the unusually rich set of covariates used, Figure 6 suggest that heterogeneity in the
estimated LATE pilot school effect over time does not drive the main results.
Testing that These Effects are Unlikely to Have Arisen by Random Chance
One may worry that the documented treatment effects could have happened by random
chance by designating any 20 schools as pilot schools and then randomly assigning cutoffs for

those between 2009 and 2012. Despite this, the treatment effect is very similar for 2010 and 2012.
36
Specifically, both boys and girls were less likely to list a pilot school as one of their four secondary school choices,
and while female applicants had similar incoming test scores before and after the transition, the average male applicant
had lower incoming scores after the transition.
37
The point estimate is 0.6 percentile points higher and is not significant at the 10 percent level.

27

each school. To test for this, I created placebo cutoffs for each school (2000 times), randomly
designated 20 schools to be “placebo pilot schools” and estimated the marginal effect of the change
in the cutoff effect for these placebo pilot schools. The actual change in the cutoff effect for the
pilot schools on math scores was 0.146 with a z-score of 5.35. The real point estimate is at the
98.9th percentile of the distribution of placebo estimates, and the z-score of the real effect is at the
99.99th percentile of the placebo effect z-scores. This is evidence that the estimated effects are real.
IV.D. Longer-Run Education Outcomes
To provide evidence on longer-run effects, Table 5 presents estimated effects on taking the
school-leaving exam (the CSEC taken in 10th grade), and performance on that exam. These models
include all students who took the SEA and not just those who take the exams. Note that these
outcomes are only available for the first two post-transition cohorts. The top panel present results
for boys and girls combined, the middle panel presents results for boys, and the lower panel
presents results for girls. As before, each point estimate is obtained from a separate regression.
The first outcome is dropping out of school before sitting these exams in 10th grade. With
boys and girls pooled, model 1 shows that after the transition to single-sex, students are 1.78
percentage points less likely to drop out of school between secondary school entry (6th grade) and
10th grade. However, the estimated effect is not statistically significant. Given the size of the
standard error, the model is underpowered to detect an effect smaller than about 10 percentage
points. There is also no detectible effect for boys and girls separately (models 10 and 19).
The next three columns examine effects on the likelihood of taking advanced math, science
or language courses in upper secondary school. While all students taking these exams will take
English, math and science, some students choose to take these subjects at the advanced level.
Taking advanced level courses is a strong indicator for likely tertiary enrollment and signals
motivation. This signaling value is similar to that of taking AP courses in the United States
(Jackson 2010). The estimated transition effects in pooled models 2, 3 and 4 reveal that students
were 7.9 percentage points more likely to take advanced English (p-value<0.05), 4.95 percentage
points more likely to take advanced math (p-value<0.05), and 13.3 percentage points more likely
to take advanced science (p-value<0.01) after the transition to single-sex. There is little effect on
the participation margin so that these increases represent an increase in advanced course taking
conditional on staying in school. The positive effects on these higher-level academic outcomes are
consistent with the large effects on test scores at the top of the achievement distribution for both
28

boys and girls (Table 3). Also consistent with this, the middle and lower panels reveal that the
estimated effects on advanced course taking are similar for boys and girls.
The last key academic outcome is earning a secondary school completion credential.
Passing five subjects including math and English will earn one a CSEC certificate. Earning this
certificate is a prerequisite to continuing in the traditional academic education system. After the
transition, students passed 0.41 more subjects (p-value<0.01). They were also 11.5 percentage
points more likely to pass the math exam (p-value<0.01), and 10.1 percentage points more likely
to pass the English exam (p-value<0.01). Not surprisingly, these students were about 7.4
percentage points (p-value<0.01) more likely to earn a certificate—that is, 7.4 percentage points
more likely to successfully complete secondary school. Only 38 percent of students who enter
secondary school leave with the prerequisites to enter tertiary education so that this represents a
sizable 19 percent increase. In sum, the results thus far suggest largely positive effects of singlesex education on both short-run and longer-run academic outcomes for both boys and girls.
IV.E. Social Outcomes
While the objective of all schools is to improve educational outcomes, parents often choose
single-sex schools because they perceive that single-sex education can enhance social outcomes.
For example, parents may send their daughters to all-girls schools in an attempt to reduce the
likelihood of teen pregnancy and may send their sons to all-boys schools with the hope that such
schools may be better able to control the boys and decrease the chances of crime and other poor
behaviors. Conversely, opponents of single-sex schooling worry that single-sex schooling may
lead to poor socialization with the opposite sex and reinforce negative gender views. To speak to
this issue, I analyze effects on arrests, and the likelihood of being a teen mother (for girls only).
Table 6 presents the results for boys and girls in the top and bottom panels, respectively.
Model 1 shows that the likelihood of being arrested by the age of 16 is lower for boys at
pilot schools after the transition than before. The estimate indicates a statistically insignificant 2.25
percentage point reduction. Looking at being arrested by age 17, the point estimate increases in
magnitude to 3.6 percentage points and is significant at the 10 percent level. Looking at being
arrested by age 18, the estimated effect for boys increases further to a 6 percentage point reduction,
and is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Given that roughly 10 percent of boys at pilot
schools prior to the transition had been arrested by age 18, this all-boys effect represents a 60
percent reduction in arrest rates. This is similar in magnitude to the effect of attending a better
29

school on crime (Deming 2011). Not surprisingly, given that boys are much more likely to be
arrested than girls, the marginal effects on girls are small and not statistically significant.
The last outcome studied is teen pregnancy. The independent variables are having a baby
by the ages of 16, 17, and 18 respectively. Model 10 shows that the transition to all-girls led to an
estimated 1.69 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of having a baby by the age of 16.
While suggestive, this estimate is not statistically significant. Because most teen births occur after
the age of 16 (as shown in Table 1), one might expect larger effects on having a baby at older ages.
Indeed this is the case. Models 11 and 12 show that the transition of pilot schools to all-girls
reduced the likelihood of having a baby by the age of 17 by 4.8 percentage points (p-value<0.05),
and that of having a baby by the age of 18 by 6.6 percentage points (p-value<0.05). Relative to
the baseline rates of teen pregnancy at pilot schools, these represent reductions of about 80 percent.
To but these estimates in perspective, these estimated reductions in teen pregnancy are as large as
those from comprehensive teenage-pregnancy prevention programs (Rosenthal et al 2009).
The results paint a picture of improved outcomes across the board after the transition to
single-sex. While I have not explored an exhaustive list of outcomes, the consistent pattern of
positive results (across academic and social outcomes) suggest that there were some real
improvements in human capital.
IV.F. Evidence on Mechanisms
Single-sex education effects likely reflect some combination of the three mechanisms
outlined in the model: (a) direct gender peer interaction effects, and the two indirect peer effects;
(b) the boutique effect, and (c) the focus effect. Even though it is impossible to disentangle these
different mechanisms, I can test for these mechanisms using survey data. In 2013, 2014 and 2015,
I administered anonymous surveys to students in pilot schools and 20 comparison coed schools. 38
I designed the survey questions to be sensitive to the mechanisms outlined in the model.
To identify the effect of the single-sex transition on survey responses, I rely on the
assumption that students in the same school in the same grade across cohorts will be exposed to
essentially the same school inputs. In addition, I only analyze answers to questions about classroom
peers and teachers and not about the students themselves so that any changes in student selection
are less of a concern. I compare survey responses of students in the same school and grade across

38

The 20 comparison schools were chosen based on selectivity, school type and location (as were the pilot schools).

30

cohorts. By looking within school grade cells, one holds school-grade level inputs constant and
one also holds the level of student maturity constant. I estimate the following model by OLS.
(11)

𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝛿𝛿1 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝛿𝛿2 + 𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

In (11), 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the response of student i in school j in grade g to the survey question, 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 is a fixed

effect for the school and grade so that all comparison are made within the same school and grade,
and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a random error term. All_Boys and All_Girls are indicator variables equal to 1 if the
school grade cell is all boys or all girls respectively in that year and 0 otherwise. The parameters
of interest are 𝛿𝛿1 and 𝛿𝛿2 -- the effect being in an all-boys or all-girls cohort (holding other school
characteristics fixed). Standard errors are clustered at the school-grade level.

Before presenting results, I first establish that the survey results are likely valid. The overall
survey response rate was 67 percent. Appendix F shows that there is no differential response by
treatment status. To provide additional checks on the validity of the survey responses, I included
three validation questions. The first question is whether most of the student’s friends are the same
gender as them, the second is whether their parents think education is important, and the third is
the reported gender of the teacher. If the survey results are valid (i.e. students respond as expected,
there is no differential selection of students, and there were no personnel changes at treatment
schools), one should see significant effects on students reporting that most of their friends are the
same gender as them, we should see no effect on whether an individual’s parents think education
is important, and we should see no effect on teacher gender. These are the patterns observed.
Are the positive effects driven by direct peer effects?
Lavy and Schlosser (2012) and Hoxby (2001) find that classrooms with larger shares of
boys (on the margin) tend to be more disruptive, and that more boys hurts all students. However,
in order for single-sex schooling to generate positive single-sex effects for both boys and girls,
either the indirect peer effects have to be large to offset any negative direct peer effect for boys, or
direct peer effects would have to be asymmetric such that boys have better outcomes when exposed
to more boys, while girls have better outcomes when exposed to more girls (as found in Whitmore
2005, Black et al 2013; Ooserbeek and van Ewijk 2014; and Lu and Anderson 2015). To test for
this, I created four indexes designed to capture the direct peer effect mechanisms presented in the
gender peer effects literature. The four measures describe whether (1) peers are disruptive, (2)
peers distract students from doing schoolwork, (3) students learn from their peers, and (4) peers

31

make students anxious. 39 The estimated effects are presented in Table 7.
Girls in the all-girls cohorts are less likely to report that their peers are disruptive and that
their peers are distracting, and more likely to report that they learn from their classmates. These
effects are large and statistically significant. Consistent with the “boys are bad” hypothesis, boys
in the all-boys cohorts are more likely to report that their peers are disruptive and that their peers
are distracting, and less likely to report that they learn from their peers. However, the effects for
boys are much smaller in magnitude than for girls, and only the effect on peer learning is
statistically significantly different from zero. In addition, while boys learn less from their peers,
there is some evidence of positive direct gender peer effects for males in other dimensions.
Specifically, boys are less likely to report that their peers make them anxious in all-boys cohorts.
That is, boys were less likely to worry about impressing classmates, less afraid to raise their hands
in class, and were less nervous when they were compared to their classmates. There is no such
effect for girls. Taken together, while the results indicate positive direct peer effects for girls, the
overall direct peer effects for boys is ambiguous. If the benefits of being less anxious around boys
are larger (or smaller) than the benefits of learning more from one’s classmates in coed settings,
the direct peer effect for boys would be positive (or negative). 40 However, the positive effects for
boys could also be due to large positive indirect peer effect. I explore this possibility below.
Are the effects driven by the boutique or the focus effect?
The other hypothesized mechanisms behind a single-sex schooling effect are indirect peer
effects driven by changes in teacher instructional practices that may lead to efficiency gains (the
focus effect) or alignment of instruction to the particular needs of each sex (the boutique effect).
While I am unable to observe the extent to which instruction is aligned toward boys or girls, I can
test for changes in student reports of teachers’ instructional practices. Specifically, if there are
different changes in teacher practices between the all-girls and all-boys environments, it would be
evidence of the boutique effect. Conversely, if there are similar changes in teacher practices in the
all-girls and all-boys settings, it would be evidence of the focus effect.
Because there are several survey questions, I created six indexes that measure teacher
practices: The first is the extent to which teachers give students individual attention. The second

39

See Appendix G for detailed discussion of the individual survey questions used to create these measures.
Note that boys do not report much higher levels of disruption in the all-boys cohorts so that the negative direct
gender peer effects through increase disruption for boys may be small. That is, even if having more boys is disruptive,
boys do not perceive it as such and may not be harmed by it.

is whether teachers use examples in their instruction. The third is the degree to which teachers
monitor and track student understanding during class. The fourth is whether teachers are warm
toward students. The fifth is whether teachers involve students in instruction. The sixth is whether
the teacher is strict. 41 Each measure is standardized to be mean zero with unit variance.
Table 6 indicates that both boys and girls report higher levels of individual teacher attention
in the single-sex cohorts. The fact that there is more reported teacher attention in both all-boys and
all-girls cohorts is indicative of an indirect peer effect and is suggestive of the focus effect. That
is, there may be some efficiency gains associated with having a more homogenous student
population that allows teachers to provide more individualized attention. This is generally
supported by the fact that both boys and girls report higher levels of teacher warmth in the singlesex cohorts (only the effect for boys is statistically significant). The evidence of the boutique effect
(i.e. using different instructional practices in the all-girls and all-boys environments) is weak.
There are no statistically significant effects on teachers using examples in class, on teachers
tracking student understanding, or in whether teachers are strict. The one practice for which there
is a change is the extent to which teachers involve students. Teachers appear to be marginally more
likely to involve students in the all-girls cohorts and slightly less likely in the all-boys cohorts.
In sum, the results suggest that single-sex environments provide positive direct peer
interaction effect for girls, while the sign of the direct peer interactions for boys is ambiguous.
Looking at indirect peer effects through teacher behaviors, the results are consistent with efficiency
gains to being in a single-sex classroom that allows teachers to give students more individualized
instruction and exhibit greater warmth (i.e. a focus effect). However, I find little evidence of
greater alignment of instruction to the particular needs of each sex (i.e. a boutique effect).
V.

Discussion and Conclusions
The merits of single-sex education have been debated for decades. Proponents of single-

sex education view it as a panacea for a host of gender-related education and social problems.
Opponents argue that there is no benefit to educating boys separately from girls and highlight that
there may be some deleterious socialization effects. Due to the difficulty of (a) identifying the
effects of single-sex schools from that of the characteristics of the individuals who attend these
schools, and (b) identifying the effects of single-sex instruction from that of the characteristics of

41

See Appendix F for details on the individual survey questions used to create these measures.

those schools that tend to be single-sex, the existing research literature has not been able to provide
conclusive evidence on the matter. This paper presents a context and empirical approach that
credibly addresses both empirical challenges. By exploiting exogenous variation in school
assignments, I isolate the effect of schools from that of students. By exploiting changes in singlesex status within schools over time, I isolate the effect of single-sex instruction from that of the
characteristics of the schools that happen to provide single-sex instruction. I find that both sources
of bias are important, and that a failure to account for them both may lead to inaccurate estimates.
The results show that single-sex education can improve both boys’ and girls’ outcomes.
Three years after being assigned to a single-sex secondary school, both boys and girls have higher
scores on standardized tests. Five years later, they are more likely to take and pass advanced
courses. In the long run, both boys and girls are more likely to have completed secondary school
and to have earned the credential required to continue to tertiary education. Importantly, boys are
also less likely to have been arrested, and girls are less likely to be teen mothers. One limitation of
existing studies on single-sex education is the lack of evidence on mechanisms. This paper presents
some new results and analysis in this regard. First, the theoretical framework highlights that the
effect of single-sex education will depend on the nature of direct gender peer effects and also
indirect peer effects that operate through the behaviors of teachers in both single-sex and coed
environments. This is supported by survey results indicating that both direct and indirect peer
effect mechanisms may have played an important role.
Note that these benefits to single-sex instruction were achieved at zero additional financial
cost. The test score effect of roughly 0.2sd is about as large as the effect of going from a teacher
at the 5th percentile to one at the 50th percentile of effectiveness. To achieve comparable results
through increases in school spending, reductions in class size, tutoring, or other interventions
would require a nontrivial financial outlay. The results of this study illustrate the potential costeffectiveness of leveraging peer effects (both direct and indirect) to improve student outcomes
(both educational and otherwise). The evidence demonstrates that, in some contexts, single-sex
education can be an effective, low-cost way to improve outcomes for low-achieving students.
Further work is needed to better identify the contexts in which single-sex instruction is likely to
improve the outcomes of both girls and boys. The theoretical framework and the evidence on
mechanisms presented herein may guide future research in these areas.

Notes: This dataset is based on the population of SEA takers during years 2006 through 2012. All SEA and NCSE
scores are standardized to be mean zero and unit variance in each cohort. Earning a certificate means passing five
subjects in the CSEC exams (10th grade) including math and English. This is the prerequisite to entering tertiary
education. Summary statistics are provided for all boys and girls taking the SEA and also the subsample of boys and
girls who attended the pilot school pre and post transition to single-sex. Standard errors are presented in parentheses.

Notes: Each column represents a separate regression. All models include the effect of attending a pilot school so that the coefficients on BoysPilot*POST and Girl-Pilot*POST represent the post-transition change in the effect of attending an all-boys pilot school and all-girls pilot
school. The coefficient on Pilot*POST represents the difference between the effect of attending any pilot school after transition and attending
any pilot school prior to transition.
a. The post only models exclude the SEA cohorts prior to 2010. Accordingly, the number of observations for this model is less than that for
the full model. There are 62,011, 64,310, and 126,321 male, female, and total observations in the post only models, respectively.
b. Predicted scores are fitted values from a regression of math scores on the number of SEA attempts (repeater status in 5th grade), the
student’s religion, indicators for the primary school, selectivity of the student’s first second third and fourth secondary school choices,
month of birth (to measure quarter of birth effects), and age at SEA. Results using the predicted average of all academic subjects are
similar.

Robust standard errors in brackets adjusted for clustering at the assigned school level.
** p<0.01, * p<0.05, + p<0.1
Each column represents a separate regression. All models include the effect of attending a pilot school so that the coefficients on BoysPilot*POST and Girls-Pilot*POST represent the post-transition change in the effect of attending an all-boys pilot school and all-girls
pilot school. All models include fourth order polynomial of incoming SEA test scores, cohort fixed effects, indicators for gender, cutoff
fixed effects, and choice group indicator variables. The number of observations is larger than in the test score regressions because these
models include observations that are missing NCSE test score data. The quintile dummies connote both taking the NCE exam and
scoring at a particular quintile of the distribution. The male sample includes 180,932 observations and the female sample has 178,859

Notes: Each column represents a separate regression. The second row indicates the dependent variable. The sample is all students who attended a pilot
school or one of the comparisons schools between 2012 and 2015 and also completed a survey. Because all models include school fixed effects, the
coefficients on Boys-Pilot*Post and Girls-Pilot*Post represent the post-transition change in the effect of attending an all-boys pilot school and allgirls pilot school. All models include survey-year fixed effects and school-gender-form fixed effects. As such, all comparisons are made among
student of the same gender at the same school (with the same teachers) in the same form but in different SEA cohorts.

excluded instruments are indicator variables denoting scoring above the threshold for an all-male or an all-female pilot
school in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. All models include fourth order polynomials of incoming test

Accounting for Treatment Heterogeneity in the Pilot School Effect

Notes: Each data point represents the 2SLS regression estimate of the attending a pilot school after the transition
relative to pre-transition. In each model, the pilot school indicator is interacted with a pre-treatment covariate to
account for possible pilot-school treatment heterogeneity. The endogenous variables are attending a pilot school pre
and post transition and the interaction between pre-treatment covariates and attending a pilot school. The excluded
instruments are indicator variables denoting whether a student scored above the threshold for a pilot school, whether
a student scored above the threshold for a pilot school in 2010 or after, and interactions between these instruments and
pre-treatment student characteristics. All models include fourth order polynomials of incoming test score, cohort fixed
effects, gender fixed effects, and choice group fixed effects.
Model 0 is the baseline model. Each model 1-10 includes interactions with pilot boy and girl school attendance and
observed student characteristics. Model 1 includes interactions between attending a pilot school and incoming SEA
scores. Models 2 and 3 include interactions between attending a pilot school and whether the student's top choice
school was single-sex, and the number of single-sex schools in the student’s choice set, respectively. Models 4 and 5
includes interactions between attending a pilot school and the average SEA of the top choice school and the average
selectivity of schools in the student’s choice set, respectively. Model 6 includes interactions between attending a pilot
school and the average SEA scores at the student’s primary school. Model 7 includes interactions between attending
a pilot school and the fraction of own gender peers at the student’s primary school. Model 8 includes interactions
between attending a pilot school and predicted math scores (predicted math scores are based on the number of SEA
attempts (repeater status in 5th grade), the student’s religion, indicators for the primary school, selectivity of the
student’s first second third and fourth secondary school choices, month of birth (to measure quarter of birth effects),
and age at SEA). Model 9 includes interactions with the average selectivity of the students next ranked school (i.e. the
counterfactual school), and Model 10 includes interactions with the percentile rank of the school ranked just below
the pilot school.

Proofs for Claims in Theoretical Section
Student outcomes are given by (1) where Yijg is the outcome of student i with teacher j of
gender 𝑔𝑔 ∈ {𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔, 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏}, Gi is an indicator equal to 1 if student i is a girl and 0 otherwise. 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ is the
share of girls in class with teacher j, the proportion of time that teacher j aligns instruction to girls
is 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ∈ [0,1], and uij is a random mean zero error term.
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 + 𝑓𝑓𝑔𝑔 �𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ � + ℎ𝑔𝑔 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 + 𝜓𝜓�2𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 − 1� + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .
(A1)
The term 𝑓𝑓𝑔𝑔 �𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗̅ � captures the direct gender peer effect that operates through peer interactions. To
allow for differential responses to the proportion of female classmates by males and females, I
include the subscript g on 𝑓𝑓𝑔𝑔 . The term, ℎ𝑔𝑔 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 captures the idea that that certain teaching practices
may benefit girls more than boys and vice versa. Where 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 is the proportion of time the teacher
spends “aligning” classroom practices to the needs of girls, ℎ𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 ≥ 0 and ℎ𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 ≤ 0. The term
𝜓𝜓�2𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 − 1� captures the idea that there may be some efficiency gains for teachers associated with
focusing their instruction to one group (either boys or girls).
A teacher’s payoff is an increasing function of the outcomes of her class 𝑊𝑊(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 ) so that
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕/𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑖𝑖 > 0 ∀𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑗𝑗. Teachers chose how much time to spend aligning instruction to girls (𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ) in
order to maximize their individual payoff.
Proposition 1: Teachers will employ entirely male-aligned instruction in all-male classrooms and
entirely female-aligned instruction in all-female classrooms
Proof: If the classroom is all-boys, then the for all 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑗𝑗, ℎ𝑔𝑔 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 < 0, so that (𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 = 0� >
(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ≠ 0�. By assumption, 𝜕𝜕𝑊𝑊/𝜕𝜕(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) > 0 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑗𝑗, so that 𝑊𝑊(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 = 0� >
𝑊𝑊(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 |𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ≠ 0). As such, teachers in all-boys classes will chose to align instruction to boys.
Similarly, if the classroom is all-girls, then the for all 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑗𝑗, ℎ𝑔𝑔 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 > 0, so that (𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 = 0� <
(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ≠ 0�. By assumption, 𝜕𝜕𝑊𝑊/𝜕𝜕(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) > 0 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑗𝑗, so that 𝑊𝑊(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 �𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 = 0� <
𝑊𝑊(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 |𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ≠ 0). As such, teachers in all-girls classes will chose to align instruction to girls.

Proposition 2: In mixed-gender classrooms, some teachers may align instruction to girls all the
time, others may align instruction to boys all the time, and some teachers may align instruction to
boys and girls some of the time.
The choice of how to align instruction will depend on the specific parameters of the production
function and the incentives faced by teachers and cannot be determined ex-ante. I outline three
illustrative cases. In all cases, I make the assumption that teacher utility is a weighted average of
the utility for each student in her class, so that 𝑊𝑊(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 ) = ∑𝑖𝑖∈𝑗𝑗 𝑙𝑙(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ).
Case 1a: If the costs of adopting a mixed strategy are sufficiently large (i.e. ψ is very large), and
teachers payoffs are convex in individual student test scores, then teachers will choose to align
50

instruction only to girls. Intuitively, with very large costs to adopting a mixed strategy, teachers
will align instruction to only girls or only boys even in mixed-gender classrooms. If teacher payoffs
are convex in individual student scores, then the marginal increase in utility will be higher for
increasing tests scores at the top of the distribution than at the bottom. Because girls are more
highly represented at the top of the distribution, teachers will choose only girl aligned instruction
in coed classrooms.
Case 1b: If the costs of adopting a mixed strategy are sufficiently large (i.e. ψ is very large), and
teacher payoffs are concave in individual student test scores, then teachers will choose to align
instruction only to boys. Intuitively, with very large costs to adopting a mixed strategy, teachers
will align instruction to only girls or only boys even in mixed-gender classrooms. If teacher payoffs
are concave in individual student scores, then the marginal increase in utility will be higher for
increasing tests scores at the bottom of the distribution. Because boys are more highly represented
at the bottom of the distribution, teachers will choose only boy aligned instruction in coed
classrooms.
Proof: Assume that the distribution of female incoming achievement has the same shape as that of
males, but is a right shift of that for males by some positive constant a -- this is consistent with my
data. If the teacher aligns instruction to males/females, then the male/female latent outcome
distribution is shifted to the right by some constant δ (i.e. ℎ𝑔𝑔 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 =−(ℎ𝑏𝑏 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 ) = 𝛿𝛿). For each percentile,
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
p, of the male distribution with latent outcome 𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
, there is a female with latent outcome
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝑎𝑎. If the teacher aligns instruction to males, then the increase in payoff for the teacher is
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
+ 𝛿𝛿, ∙� − 𝑊𝑊(𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

distribution so that the teacher’s payoff is higher if she aligns instruction to females. Conversely,
if teacher payoffs are concave, then this inequality is reversed for all percentiles of the male
distribution so that the teacher’s payoff is higher if she aligns instruction to males.
Case 3: If ψ is small, teachers may adopt some mixed approach. In the extreme case where there
is no cost to adopting a mixed strategy, teacher payoffs are linear in the average for the classroom,
there are equal number of boys and girls in the classroom, and boys and girls are equally responsive
to alignment, teachers will be indifferent between adopting a mixed strategy or aligning instruction
to only one sex. In such cases, a mixed strategy may be adopted in coeducation classrooms.
Proof: With linear payoffs, equal numbers of boys and girls, and equal responsiveness to alignment
for boys and girls, the teachers expected payoff function under female alignment minus her payoff
under male alignment is 𝜏𝜏[ℎ𝑔𝑔 (𝑝𝑝) − ℎ𝑏𝑏 (𝑝𝑝)], where 𝜏𝜏 is some scalar. If the average marginal effect
of alignment is the same for both male and female students, then ℎ𝑔𝑔 (𝑝𝑝) = ℎ𝑏𝑏 (𝑝𝑝) ∀ 𝑝𝑝, so that
𝜏𝜏�ℎ𝑔𝑔 (1) − ℎ𝑏𝑏 (1)� = 0. In such a scenario, teachers are indifferent between aligning instruction to
boys only, girls only, or adopting some mixed strategy. It is easy to come up with other scenarios
in which teacher will chose some mixed strategy.

Appendix C:
The School Assignment Algorithm
School slots are assigned in rounds such that the most highly subscribed/ranked school fills
its spots in the first round, then the next highly subscribed school fills its slots in the second round,
and so on until all school slots are filled. This is done as follows: (1) the number of school slots at
each school nj is predetermined based on capacity constraints. (2) Each student is tentatively placed
in the applicant pool for her first choice school and is ranked by SEA score. (3) The school at
which the njth ranked student has the highest SEA score is determined to be the most highly
subscribed/ranked school and the top nj1 students in the applicant pool for top-ranked school j1 are
admitted to school j1. The SEA score of the nj1-th student is the cutoff score for school j1. (4) The
top-ranked school slots and the admitted students are removed from the process, and the second
choice becomes the new "first choice" for students who had the top-ranked school as their first
choice but did not gain admission. (5) This process is repeated in round two to assign students to
the second highest ranked school j2 and determine the cutoff score for the second-ranked school,
and this is repeated in subsequent rounds until all slots are filled. This assignment mechanism is a
deferred acceptance algorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962) in which students have incentives to
truthfully reveal their rankings among chosen schools.
While the optimal set of school choices is difficult to solve, Chade, and Smith (2006)
demonstrate that the choice set should include the school with the largest expected payoff (utility
conditional on attendance times the likelihood of admission), students should rank selected schools
in order of actual preferences, and should include a “reach” school for which admission is unlikely
but the utility conditional on attendance is high.
This process is used to assign over 90% of all students. As such, as a practical matter, one
can consider this applying to all students. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. First,
Government Assisted schools (not analyzed in this study) are allowed to admit 20% of their
incoming class at the principal’s discretion. None of the pilot school is Government assisted so
that there is no problem of principals hand picking students at the pilot schools. However, there
are also assignments that do not follow this rule because students who do not score high enough
to be assigned to a school on their choice list receive an administrative assignment from the
Ministry of Education (these assignments are made to balance space considerations). Finally, due
to unforeseen circumstances some schools may have less capacity than expected or may close (this
may happen due to flooding etc.). In such rare cases, the Ministry will assign students to schools
based on open slots in nearby schools, open slots in other schools in the choice list, and proximity.
I aim to use this assignment rule to isolate exogenous variation to the 20 pilot schools. A
key feature of this assignment rule is that each school has a test score cutoff above which applicants
are very likely to be assigned and below which applicants are very unlikely to be assigned. Even
though the cutoffs are not known to the public and not all the administrative assignments follow
the cutoff rule (due to a few exceptions made by the MOE), because I have access to the
administrative assignment (which is outside the control of the students or their parents), the cutoffs
can be recovered empirically for the 20 pilot schools.

Appendix D:
Robustness Checks and Test of Validity
Validity of the RD Variation
The exogenous variation used in this paper is driven by the test-score cutoffs. Even though
there is no way to prove for certain that the cutoff variation is valid, here I present evidence that
this identification strategy is valid. One key diagnostic is to test for excess density above the cutoff
and less than expected density below the cutoff (McCrary 2008). The first prima facie evidence of
no change in density through the cutoff is simply the histogram of relative scores. As one can see
in Figure 3, there is no uncharacteristic spike in density above the cutoff or dip in density just
below the cutoff. If one computes the density of observations at each relative score and regresses
this on scoring above the cutoff along with smooth functions of the relative score, there is no
statistically significant relationship between scoring above the cutoff and the density. The point
estimate is -0.0006 (p-value=0.53) – negative and not statistically significant. Taken together, the
patterns suggest that the variation due to the test score cutoffs is likely valid. The other common
test is for smoothness of latent outcomes (as proxied by covariates) through the cutoffs. In
presenting the results I present effects on both actual outcomes and predicted outcomes (based on
covariates) that show that the cutoff variation in pilot school attendance is not associated with any
changes in predicted outcomes – consistent with the cutoff variation being valid.
Section III.D shows that there is little evidence of gaming around the cutoffs regarding the
density of observation at each test score. However, the validity of the design also requires that
there be no sorting of students around the cutoff (i.e. that latent outcomes are smooth through the
cutoff). Given that students are unaware of the location of the cutoffs and are forced to make school
choices before they take the SEA examinations, it is very unlikely that there is any sorting around
the test score cutoffs. However, to provide further evidence that the variation employed (due to the
cutoffs) is valid, I create a predicted math score variable and test for whether the 2SLS model
(using the cutoff variation) predicts any change in predicted math scores.
Specifically, I regress the NCES math score on the number of SEA attempts (repeater status
in 5th grade), the student’s religion, indicators for the primary school, selectivity of the student’s
first second third and fourth secondary school choices, month of birth (to measure quarter of birth
effects), and age at SEA. These variables are very strong predictors of math scores such that they
yield an R-squared of 0.45. I then take the fitted value from this regression as my predicted math
score. If there is some gaming of the cutoff, one would likely see that attending a pilot school as a
result of scoring above the cutoff should be associated with better “predicted” scores. However,
with no gaming there should be no relationship between scoring above the cutoff and one’s
predicted score. Consistent with no gaming, there is no relationship between scoring above the
cutoff and one’s predicted math score. Column 7 of Table 3 shows the estimated effect on predicted
math scores for the all-boys pilot schools. The coefficients on the variables of interest are both
small and statistically insignificant – indicating no gaming of the cutoff to the all-boys pilot
schools. Column 7 of Table 4 shows the estimated effect on predicted math scores for the all-girls
pilot schools. As with the boy’s schools, the coefficients on the variables of interest are both small
and statistically insignificant – indicating no gaming of the cutoff to the all-girls pilot schools.
Results for predicted average academic scores are very similar. As an additional check on this
model, I estimated the effect on math scores and also on predicted math score (without controlling
for choices) for different bandwidths around the cutoff. Appendix Figure D2, present these results
visually. As one can see for any choice of bandwidth, there are large positive effects on math
54

scores and no effect on predicted math scores.
Another concern one may have is that the 2SLS effects driven by the cutoffs could have
happened by random chance by choosing any 20 random schools and any arbitrary cutoffs. To
assuage this concern, I randomly chose 20 schools to be placebo pilot schools and for each school
I assigned random “placebo” cutoffs to each placebo pilot school. I then estimated the effect on
math scores of scoring above the cutoff for a pilot school after the transition (after 2010) relative
to before. I did this with a new random draw of placebo pilot schools and cutoffs 2000 times and
compared the placebo estimates to the actual estimate using the actual cutoffs. The real cutoff
effect is 0.154 (p-value<0.01). Only 21 out of the 2000 placebo cutoffs was as large as the actual
cutoff effect. Also, none of the z-scores for the estimated effects were as large as the actual z-score
of 5.4. This indicates that the estimated cutoff effect (and the associated 2SLS estimates) is much
larger than on might expect by random chance if there were indeed no single-sex effect.
Validity of DiD Variation
For the DiRD estimates to represent the causal effect of single-sex education requires that
there were no changes in the pilot schools over time that coincided with the pilot program.
Confounding changes within schools is unlikely because, (a) the individual schools had no control
over when they would become pilot schools, (b) the government stipulated that no other changes
take place in these schools, and (c) schools were not made aware of the changes until the summer
preceding the change so that schools had no time to react before the start of the school year. Even
so, one may worry that the pilot schools were already on an upward trajectory prior to transition.
To show evidence that this does not drive the results, Figure 5 presents the RD estimates for
attending a pilot school for each year three years before and three years after the transition on math
scores. Each data point is an RD point estimate, and the 90 percent confidence interval is presented
for each RD estimate. The figure also presents 90 percent confidence interval of the regression fit
where the mean outcomes for the pre and post transition are pooled across individual years (as in
the actual regression models). The RD estimates for 2007 through 2009 hover around -0.13, and
there is no indication of an upward trend at pilot schools prior to the transition. Consistent with the
positive single-sex effects for boys and girls, the pilot school effects in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are
higher than that in the pre-treatment years and hover around 0.08. The difference between the RD
estimates pre and post transition suggest that the transition increased the RD pilot school effect by
roughly 0.13+0.08=0.21sd —in line with Table 2. Importantly, Figure 5 presents a clear visual
representation of the DiD variation employed and provides compelling evidence that the DiD
identifying common trends assumption is valid.
Even though the MOE clearly stipulated that there be no changes, as a final check on the
DiD assumptions of no other changes, I used survey data collected by the MOE on a sample of
teachers at all schools obtained in 2009 and 2013 to see if there were any systematic personnel
changes that occured during the transition. In a simple difference in difference regression model
predicting school level teacher characteristics with school fixed effects and year fixed effects
(Appendix Table D1), between 2009 and 2013 the transition schools saw no differential change in
the percentage of female teachers, or the percentage of teachers with a Bachelor’s degree. There
is a marginally statistically significant effect on year-of-birth at the all-male pilot schools. This is
consistent with sampling variability and is in the opposite direction of what would be required to
generate a positive transition effect for the all-male pilot schools. I also explore if differences in
class size (proxied by cohort size) can explain the results. In a simple model predicting initial
cohort size (i.e. the size of the assigned cohort) with school fixed effects and year fixed effects,
55

the post-transition pilots have no statistically significant differences in cohort size (and the effect
for the all-male and all-female pilot schools are in opposite directions). The results corroborate the
notion that there were no other changes at pilot schools.

Appendix E:
Evidence of Changes in Applicant Pool
After the transition from coed to single-sex, the applicant pool to the pilot schools changed.
To gain a sense of this, I regressed listing a pilot school as a first choice, second choice, third
choice, and fourth choice on a simple Post indicator denoting whether the observation is for an
SEA cohort in 2010 or after. The constant term and the coefficient on Post are reported in Table
E1. The constant term represents the proportion of the sample that lists a pilot school in their
choices during the pre-transition period, and the coefficient on Post is the change in proportion
after the transition.
The constant terms in Models 1 through 4 show that the pilot boy schools were typically
listed as students third of fourth choices. About 8.5 percent have it as a third choice and 8.5 percent
list an all-boys pilot as the fourth choice, while the comparable numbers for the first and second
choice are about 2.7 and 5.5 percent, respectively. After the transition, boys were 0.4 percentage
points more likely to list an all-boys pilot as their second choice, 2.54 percentage points more
likely to list an all-boys pilot as their third choice, and to 6.36 percentage points more likely to list
an all-boys pilot as their fourth choice. Some of this increased demand would have come from
boys who would have listed the all-girls pilot switching over to the all-boys pilot, so that this may
not be indicative of increased demand for all-boys schooling. To assess this, the dependent variable
in models 5 through 8 is listing any pilot school as a first, second third or fourth choice. If students
were indifferent to the change and simply listed the all-boys school in each pair if they would have
chosen the all-girls pilot school, there should be no effect on choosing any pilot school. The
coefficient on the post indicator is negative in all models, suggesting that, overall boys were less
likely to list pilot schools after the transition than before. The results for girls in models 9 through
16 tell a similar story. Girls are more likely to list an all-girls pilot school after the transition than
before, but are less likely to list a pilot school in general after the transition. Also, the magnitudes
of the changes are very similar to those for boys.
Given that there was a change in the likelihood that students would select a pilot school, it
is helpful to determine the extent to which the applicant pools differ before versus after the
transition. To determine this, I plot the incoming (standardized) SEA scores for boys applying to
the all-boys pilots over time and the incoming (standardized) SEA scores for girls applying to the
all-girls pilots over time. A student is deemed an applicant if at least one of the schools in their
choice set is an all-girls or all-boys pilot school. These are plotted in Figure E1 along with the 95%
confidence interval. As one can clearly see, the girl applicants to the all-girls pilot schools had
similar test scores before and after the transition. This suggests little selection to the all-girls pilot
schools (as indicated in the regression results in table 3). For boys, however, there is clear evidence
of negative selection. The boys who applied to the all-boys pilot schools had lower incoming SEA
scores after the transition than before. Taken together, the patterns suggest that the higher
achieving boys who would have applied to a pilot school opted to attend other schools after the
transition. In contrast, those girls who decided to apply to the all-girls pilot schools after the
transition look very similar to those who applied before the change.

Each column represents a separate regression. The sample is all students who attended a pilot school or
one of the comparisons schools between 2012 and 2015 and also completed a survey. Because all models
include school fixed effects, the coefficients on Boys-Pilot*Post and Girls-Pilot*Post represent the posttransition change in the effect of attending an all-boys pilot school and an all-girls pilot school,
respectively. All models include survey year fixed effects and school-gender-form fixed effects. As such,
all comparisons are made among student of the same gender at the same school (with the same teachers)
in the same form but in different SEA cohorts.
