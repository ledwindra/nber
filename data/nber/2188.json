These micro-economic models which lead to credit-rationing on the one hand and limitations in the availability of equity type financing on the other can account for a wide range of observed business cycle and monetary phenomena. These include (a) unemployment, (b) the existence of Keynesian-type multiples, (c) the observed lack of production smoothing in response to cyclical fluctuations in demand, (d) the impact of monetary policy on business activity despite the absence of significant changes in real interest rates, and (e) price rigidities which arise from rational firm decisions (not as an a priori assumption).\n\n",
