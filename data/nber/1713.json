In an earlier paper, I showed in the context of a world without uncertainty that variations in tax receipts from this source would have no real effects. The extension of the analysis to a world of risk turns out to involve new elements that may be of some general interest. In particular, the conditions for neutrality seem less likely to be fulfilled in a practical context.\n\n",
