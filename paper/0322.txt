NON-TRIVIAL EQUILIBRIUM IN AN ECONOMY WITH STOCHASTIC RATIONING
Seppo Honkapohja and Takatoshi Ito

Abstract

Stochastic rationing when the market does not clear draws attention
because both Drèze (1975) and Benassy (1975) quantity-constrained equilibria

have some undesirable features. Gale (1978) gave the existence proof of
trade under uncertainty. His stochastic rationing depends on all the indivi-

dual effective demands. It is too vague to characterize a rationing mechanism.
Moreover, his assumption to ensure a non-trivial equilibrium is economically
not clear.

In this paper we extend Green (1978) to characterizing the rationing
scheme as the individual effective demand times the rationing number which is a

function of the aggregate quantity signals. We also construct an economy with
money and overlapping generations. We show the existence of the non—trivial
equilibrium and provide an example of a non-Wairasian equilibriim at the
Walrasjan :equi1ibn.um prices.

1. Introduction
One of the key features in the disequilibrium theory is to face the
fact that trades take place before all the markets clear through the

Walrasian tatonnement process. Moreover, we usually assume the fixed price
and the quantity adjustments in the short run. By quantity adjustments we
mean the revision of individual optimization plans taking into account the

quantity constraints in some markets. However, there are several ways how to
formulate this process. Drèze (1975) defined the effective demands as the
optimal quantity to maximize utility with quantity limit (the upper and lower

bounds). Within the bounds you can trade as much as you want. Therefore,
there are no excess effective demand or supply left in the Dfeze equilibrium.
This is unsatisfactory when we discuss disequilibrium measures such as un-

employment and excess capacity of plants. Benassy (1975) proposed the effective
demand for the ith good as the amount of the ith good which maximizes the
utility given the quantity constraints in all the markets other than the ith.
Since economic agents have to solve the different maximization problems as
many times as the number of the commodities, the budget constraint does not

hold in the effective demand level. This is not satisfactory from the viewpoint of rationality.

The undesirable features in the Drze or Benassy equilibrium lead
researchers to investigate the so-called stochastic rationing schemes. The
realization after the announcement of the effective demands are stochastic.
Svensson (l977)discussed a stochastic rationing scheme and individual decision
making but he did not proceed to establish the market expectational equilibrium which guarantees the rationing scheme is correct in the statistical
sense in the market.

1—2

Douglas Gale (1977) and Jerry Green (1978) gave the most general
treatment of the stochastic rationing equilibria, where individuals in the

pure exchange economy have the probability distributions on the realization

of his effective demands. With some conditions on the expectation of
rationing given the actions taken by other agents Gale and Green showed
the existence of the stochastic rationing equilibria.
Although their equilibria show that the budget constraint should be
met in the effective demand level, it does not mean the stochastically
realized trade is such that everybody balance the budget. Moreover, Gale

showed the existence of the non-trivial equilibria, but the sufficient condition
is rather vague to be meaningfully interpreted, where the trivial equilibrium
is the no-action equilibrium.

In this paper, we specify our economy as an overlapping generations

model with production and the government. We impose the ex post budget
constraint and the ex post production constraint rather than ones in terms of

effective demands. This gives the possibility of discussion of disequilibrium
dynamics in the long-run. We also show a meaningful sufficient condition
for the non-trivial equilibria.

This framework has also am interesting feature that there may exist
a non-Walrasian equilibrium at the Wairasian equilibrium prices, even though
expectations and agents are perfectly (trational.?? This is confirmed by a

numerical example in the appendix. Note that in our framework, this phenomenon
is caused by the pure pessimism, in contrast to Heller and Starr (1979) whose
example of the same effect is not quite correct in that they allow the money
endowments to vary (hence money prices are 'wrong' though relative prices of

goods are correct.")

1—3

Temporary equilibrium mod&Ls withir overlapping generations have
been studied by Grandmont and Laroque (1973), Fuchs and Laroque (1976),

and Fuchs (1976). They assume that prices move fast enough to clear
the spot markets within a period. They define the stationary market equilibrium
of the series of prices for the relevant length of time generating the present

expected price equal to that price. They showed the conditions for the existence
of the stationary market equilibrium; its Pareto efficiency, the local
stability of the economy near the equilibrium with respect to the characteristics of its agents and a money stock; and the structural stability with
respect to the expectations.

2. Framework and Notations
Our economy is composed of four different types of economic agents:

H consumers in each of the young and old generation; firms; and the government. There are I different consumption goods and one type of factor of
production named labor. The government issues money which is used as the
medium of exchange and as the store of value. A young consumer is endowed with
no initial money balance and the positive potential labor force. The young
supplies labor, demands consumption goods and saves for the next period. An
older consumer with carried-over money balance does not work any more but

just consumes before the end of the life. Each of I consumption goods are

produced by F identical firms. The production technology of each industry
is characterized by a well-behaved neo—classical production function, f'(.)
The prices of the consumption goods, (P1,

P2

,

P1)

and the nominal

wage, w, are fixed within a period. The aggregate demand and supply Isignals?!
for each market,

are announced and distributed among the economic agents

without costs. Y and

denote the aggregate demand and supply signal in

the ith market, respectively, and Ld and LS denote those of the labor market,

respectively. According to the aggregate signals and the individual effective
demand (or supply), the economic agent faces the stochastic rationing of trade.
An individual agent is assumed to take the aggregate signals as given and to
think that his individual effective demand is so small compared to the market

signals thatchange in his own individual effective demand is negligible. This
assumption is similar to the price-taker assumption in the Walrasian economy.
The realization of trades occur after all the economic agents submit their

effective demands and supplies. The stochastic rationing mechanism will be
defined in the next section.

2-2

Let us sketch the economic agents decision-making. Consuiners,whether
they are young or old, maximize their expected utility. Older consumers,
(

k =

1,...,

H )

plan

which goods they should order out of the pre-

determined money balance which is the consequence of the preceding period.

Young consumers (h = 1,

..., H) have to take into account the possibility of

future rationing as well as the present one. A consumer, h, submits his
effective demand for the ith, consumption goods, y, and his effective supply

of labor, ,

after

maximizing the expected utility function with the budget

contraint in the "worst" case of rationing possibility. Therefore, the
effective demand (or supply) is the amount up to which the consumer is "ready"

to buy (or sell). Since an older consumer is not allowed to work, a younger
consumer plans the non-negative money balance for all possible cases of rationing.

A firm, f,-in the ith

industry

which is assumed to be risk-neutral

maximizes its expected profit. It submits the effective demand for labor,

and the effective supply of the consumption goods, y

.

The effective

demand for labor and the effective supply of the goods have to be technologically possible in the "worst" rationing case, i.e., the maximum possible

assignment of sales and the minimum assignment of hiring labor. Therefore,

effective demand and supply are again the amounts that the firm is "ready"
to accept.
the

Since all the markets meet simultaneously,the effective demand and
supply

is final once they are submitted. The origin is assumed to be included

in the production possibility set, hence the firms never plan the negative

expected profit. However, the realization of events may be such that a firm
incurs losses from hoarding the excess labor relative to restrictive rationing

2-3

on sales. Considering that some firms do make losses in the real world, we
do not think this is a bad assumption. We assume that all the realized profits

and losses are taxed or subsidized by the government. Therefore, the only
store of value available for the young generation is money. The government

demands the constant amount of the consumption goods (y, y, ..., y)and
labor services

A temporary equilibrium with stochastic rationing, given the fixed prices,
is defined as the signals of aggregate demands and supplies which induce economic

agents to submit individual effective demands and supplies which exactly summed
up to the signals.

In this kind of expectational equilibrium, we usually have the trivial

equilibrium of no-action (see Gale (1977), the last section). That is, if
the signals show zero aggregate demand and supply, then individuals feel they

cannot sell anything. This gives zero purchasing power and zero effective
demands. Therefore, the signals with zero demand and supply are confirmed as
an equilibrium. We are going to show that the existence of government and
the old generation with sure purchasing power, the rationing probability
distribution function bounded away from zero, and the well-behaved production
functions are enough to prove that the trivial equilibrium vanishes.

3-1

3. Stochastic Rationing
Let us describe the stochastic rationing scheme we are going to adopt.
The firm announces its "effective demand't for labor,

and its "effective

supply" of the ith consumption goods, y. The consumer announces his
"effective demand" for the consumption goods, (y1, y,

...,

y')

and his

"effective supply" of labor, h Since the prices are fixed during the period
there is stochastic rationing in the market to make trades feasible.
Rationing is an assignment of trade, which is called "realization," by random

drawing according to a known distribution. We are going to adopt the following
axioms established by Green (1978):

I)

The probability distribution of rationing to the jth agent in the ith (or
labor) market depends only on the jth effective demand (or supply) and the

quantity signals of the ith market. That is, the distribution is indepen-

dent across the markets. Moreover, the distributions are the same if
the agents in the same market offer the same effective demand (or supply).

II) Rationing does not change the side of the market i.e., a demander remains
buying the goods, and a supplier selling the goods.
III) Agents are not forced to buy (or sell) more than the amount they announce
as the effective demand (or supply).

IV) The mean of the probability distribution of rationing balances demand
and supply.

V)

The probability distribution of rationing is continuous when endowed
with the topology of weakly convergence.

3-2

The fourth condition requires that the realized trade balances only

its "mean." It is debatable whether we can actually devise a rationing scheme
which balances "realized" aggregate demand with supply "with certainty"

keeping individual rationing stochastic. We will come back to this point
later.

The fifth condition is the standard technical assumption.
Green showed that the rationing scheme satisfying the above axioms is
representable in the following form:

demand from the firm f in the ith industry; and h is the effective labor
from household h;

are stochastic functions depending on the individual effec-

tive demand and the market quantity signals. The stochastic rationing functions
have the means which are independent of the induvidual offers.

Notice that all the firms in the ith industry are identical in the

production function and behavior. Therefore, we have the following simplified
stochastic rationing function:

This is an ad hoc assumption, which implies that an economic agent expects
the proportional rationing independent of his action.
In order to ensure the axioms above, we have certain requirements on
the supports of the probability distributions.

Although Assumption 3.1 is necessary to ensure the axioms II) and III),

it seems too weak an assumption to derive a meaningful equilibrium. The combination of this assumption with the budget constraint and the production

feasibility in the "worst" cases will end up with the trivial equilibrium. We
are going to assume stronger assumptions about the response of distributions
to the aggregate signals.

A usual assumption in the disequilibrium macroeconomics is that the

trade is realized at the short side of the market. This assumption implies
that the probability distribution is degenerate at unity for agents in the

short side of the market. For example, suppose that the excess demand
prevai1s in the ith market. And as the disequilibrium deepens, the
long side anticipates the "worse" distribution. We are going to characterize

3-5

this idea by putting restrictions on the upper bound and the lower bound

of the support of the probability distribution. The following are the
assumptions on rationing that the firm faces.

Example

We will give an example of a rationing scheme in an economy where

all firms in an industry and all consumers are identical. The following
rationing scheme preserves the equal treatment of individuals (i.e., the
name does not matter), rational expectations on the quantity rationing scheme,
the randomness for individuals; and balances of the aggregate demand and
supply not only in the mean but also in realization with probability one.
The rationing scheme also preserves the above-mentioned assumptions on the
support of the distribution.

Take the representative firm in the ith consumption good market:

his stochastic realization of supply, y is now the effective demand multiplied by a stochastic "rationing number" s which depends on the market

signals.

We also need one technical assumption. There is an even number of
firms. Now we explain the procedure of rationing. Suppose the market signal,
is less than one.

(I) First stage is to make the lottery tickets

stochastically: we are going to create F (an even number of firms) tickets.
For the first ticket, draw a random number between s and s. The second
ticket is s

this process F/2 times; (II) The second stage is the random drawing to decide the
ordering of firms to draw the prepared tickets; (III) The third stage is that
the first firm decided by the second stage draw randomly one ticket from the
urn

prepared

by the first stage, and the drawn ticket is removed from the

urn. Repeat the process F times to exhaust firms and tickets.
By the first stage, the sum of the rationing tickets add up to

sF FY'/Y with certainty. Each firm

definition of temporary equilibrium with stochastic rationing,

yf =

Therefore, the aggregate realization of rationing is always d That is,
the rationing scheme balances the aggregate demand and supply in realization

with probability one. However, from the individual point of view, the rationing is stochastic and the distribution of rationing number is exactly ex-

plained above. Although the third stage of drawing means that a distribution of rationing tickets is dependent on other drawings, the second stage

3-9

erases this problem. Hence, the identical distribution of rationing with
anonymity as a whole system is preserved.

Note also that

and satisfy assumptions made.

4. The Firms' Behavior

There are F firms in each of I industries of consumption goods.
All the firms in the ith industry are identical. The representative firm f
in the ith industry produces output

by the actual labor input 4

function with the following properties:

Now we can set up the maximization problem. The representative firm's

4-3

(4.4)

means that in the "realization" terms, the firm has to be able

to fulfill its promise of effective supply even if the most rationing in

5. The Consumer's Behavior

Let us now consider a representative consumer h. To begin with we
introduce the notations with subscript t:

effective

o

= effective

o <

demand for good i by consumer h at period t,

supply of labor by h at period t,

= aggregate effective demand for good i at period t,

L = aggregate

effective supply of labor at period t.

Similarly, we denote by

'

L the aggregate demand for labor. They will

appear as signals in the rationing mechanisms. Also, we let
o

< Lh

—t
=

=

the

price

w = nominal

of good i at period t,

wage at period t,

realized

=
=

endowment of labor of consumer h,

realized

purchases of good i by consumer h at period t,
sales of labor by consumer h at period t.

Finally, if subscript

is dropped the notation signifies the corresponding

I-dimensional vector, where I is the number of goods in each period.
At each period a generation of consumers h =

1,

..., H

is born. They

live for two periods. In the 1st period a consumer sells labor and buys goods.
In the 2nd period he is retired and only buys goods with money balances he

has carried forward from the 1st period of his lifetime. No planned bequests

5—2

exist, so a household has no initial money balances. Any involuntary bequests caused by rationing are taxed away by the government.
Since realizations are random it is natural to assume that the house-

hold has a preference relation h over probability distributions of
realizations. We shall adopt the simpler hypothesis of expected utility
maximization i.e.,

2I+ --

h can be represented by adopting a utility function

IR such that

be taken to be concave. (For a further discussion of this issue

see Grandmont (1972, 1977 and 1978) .)

To relate realized transactions to effective demands and supplies we
follow the approach of Green (1978) with one further simplification: the
(stochastic) fractions of effective demand/supply that are realized are

independent of the effective demand/supply of each individual consumer. The
fractions do depend on aggregate effective demand and supply in the market.

The assumptions of sign-preservation, continuity, etc. made by Green (1978) hold.
Let

t÷1' denote the random elements in the rationings in each period. Then,

we have

Condition

(II) rules out the

-

possibility of bankruptcy or default. This is so because they are assigned
undefined expected disutility (compare Green (1978)). Note also that the
second inequality in (II) involves effective demands

rather than

realizations. This is natural since a consumer does not plan any bequests,
and furthermore, realization will never exceed the demand.

fixed-point argument that follows, so we consider them in detail.

Next, consider the producers. From section 2 we recall that the firm's

What would the rationing function for demand in a market look like when the

signal of aggregate supply is equal to zero. The plausible answer is that the

rationing degenerate at O} .

If

there is any "rational" restriction in the

rationing functions, this must be the one. Similarly, if the signals for
aggregate demand in a market is equal to zero, then the rationing function for
the supply side of the market should degenerate at {O}.

aggregate signals are equal to zero {c} =

O,

Therefore, if all the

then the induced

aggregate demands and supplies are also zero, and this should be equilibrium.

This is called the "trivial equilibrium." However, in our framework, the
trivial equilibrium conflict with two assumptions we made earlier.

First, the

government which has the power to finance by itself printing money demands a
positive amount of consumption goods and labor; Secondly, the older generation is at

least indifferent between putting down the deposit for effective demands and

carrying the money to a coffin. Therefore,

positive amount, by proposition 2.3. Therefore, our economy with the
government and the old generation who has money to spend and the well-behaved

production function generates a "non-trivial equilibrium." These assumptions
are compatible with Gale (1977: Theorem 3)

Since L > 0,

we see that the necessary smoothing (Lemmas 3.1-3.3) does

create any problems i.e, c* does notbelong to the exceptional set. Hence,

we have proved the main theorem.

Theorem 6.1 There exists a non-trivial temporary equilibrium with stochastic
rationing.

7-1

7. Stability and Dynamics: Open Question
We have shown the existence of a temporary equilibrium with stochastic

rationing. There are two steps in the research agenda we are going to proceed to
in the near future. First, we have to show the short-run stability of expectations on the aggregate signals. We ought to devise some mechanism to reach the
temporary equilibrium. This process is supposed to take place within a period
to ensure "rational expectations on rationing." Secondly, we would like to show
the long-run stability of price-adjustment. Although the prices are assumed to
be fixed within a period, they may change over time. Therefore, we would like
to show that the price dynamics in a sense does not "explode," or, moreover,
stay near the properly defined equilibrium.
The first problem corresponds to the tatonnement process in the Walrasian

(temporary) equilibrium. The only difference is that our tatonnement process is
done in the quantity terms instead of the prices space. The second problem has
been studied in a similar framework. Grandmont and Hildenbrandt (1974) used
an over-lapping generations model without rationing, i.e., Pt is adjusted to

clear the spot markets, but the endowments are random every period. They showed
that the price dynamics becomes the Markov process. Green and Majumbar (1975)
considered the model that prices are determined before the stochastic endowments
are revealed so that there may be the excess demands in a period, which, with
the current price, deterinines the price in the following period. They showed
the existence of a "stochastic equilibrium" as invariant probability distributions

of prices. Green and Majumdar allow the excess demand to prevail. However,
they did not provide any theory of how to carry out, if any, transactions when

there is excess demand. Therefore, our model can be regarded as giving a rationale
for their model. But, note also that the quantity signals as well as the prices

7-2

should be considered as the variables to describe dynamics in a proper framework.

This is the topic we are going to explore. An alternative way to handle the
above-mentioned two concepts of stability is that we allow the temporary
discrepancy between the aggregate signals announced at the beginning of the period

and the aggregate effective demand and supply. All other features are the same
within a period. The question to be asked then is whether the dynamics of the
quantity signals, the prices and the expectation formations on the both signals
(in the sense of Fuchs (1977)), are "stable."

This seems to be very interesting

but complicated.

Finally, there is one more source of dynamics in the model, namely that of

savings, when one imposes a government budget constraint to the system. Böhm
(1978) and Honkapohja (1978) considered this issue in the context of a macro-

economic model of the Benassy type. It would be interesting to analyze similar
problems with the present framework, in particular, since expectation formation
is now explicit.

8-1

8. Conclus:ions

The purpose of this paper was to develop a workable framework for the analysis of temporary equilibrium with stochastic rationing, which, so far, is the
most convincing framework about the formation of demands and supplies in the

context of non-clearing markets. Though perhaps the most interesting problems of
dynamics still await an answer, we were able to analyze the determination of a

temporary solution in some detail. In particular, an analysis shows that the
problem of non-triviality of equilibria can be overcome in a relatively simple way:
government expenditures provide the necessary signal for producers to produce
and hire inputs.

The example of a non—Walrasian equilibrium at the Walrasian equilibrium

prices raises some fundamental issues. The Keynesian multiplier story is more than
a "deviation-amplifying' process at "wrong" prices. Indeed, even at the Walrasian
equilibrium prices, the pure pessimism about trading opportunities can make
agents reduce their effective demands and hence create a recession.
