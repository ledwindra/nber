Methodological Issues in the Evaluation of Parental Involvement Laws: Evidence from Texas

JEL No. J13,J18
ABSTRACT
The number of states that require parental involvement in a minors decision to terminate a pregnancy
has more than doubled since 1988. Congress is currently considering legislation that would further
limit access to abortion for minors who reside in states that enforce parental involvement laws. So
far, the academic literature has not reached a consensus as to the impact of such abortion restrictions,
mainly due to methodological limitations caused by the inability to measure cross-state travel and
misclassification of exposure. Using detailed data on abortions and births from Texas, we demonstrate
that these limitations led researchers to overestimate the decline in minors abortion rate, underestimate
the increase in their birth rate, and to miss an important behavioral response to the law, which is the
tendency to delay the abortion among a group of older minors. Correction of these methodological
problems is important given the controversy surrounding abortion and the need of voters and policymakers
to accurately assess the likely impact of these laws.

Introduction
Parental involvement laws require that an abortion provider notify a parent(s) of a
minor’s request for an abortion, or that the parent(s) provide written consent, before a procedure
can be performed. In 1988, only 13 states had such laws, but currently, thirty-five states enforce
parental involvement laws.1 Residents of California and Oregon will vote this November on
whether to make parental notification requirement for minors seeking an abortion state law.
Further, legislation in both the U.S. House and Senate would extend enforcement of the parental
involvement law in the minor’s state of residence to any state in which she sought an abortion.2
Such legislation could substantially increase the effect of a parental notification law in California
and Oregon, since it would prevent minors from traveling to Nevada and Washington in order to
avoid compliance.
A major argument by proponents of such laws is that they reduce teen abortions and
lower teen pregnancy rates.3 This inference is based on studies that report a fall in abortions
among minors in response to a parental involvement law unaccompanied by a rise in births.
Many voters and policymakers would view favorably such a decline in teen pregnancies. If,
however, the decline in teen pregnancies is spurious, and if in fact birth rates rose after a parental
involvement law, then the subsequent rise in unintended childbearing by minors would likely
dampen enthusiasm for such laws.

Advocates of parental involvement laws in California are seeking to instate a parental notification statute through a
ballot initiative in November of 2006. The website in support of the initiative cites as “fact” that parental
involvement laws reduce “the number of abortions on teens by 15 percent while also reducing the overall teen
pregnancy rate.” http://www.parentsright2know.org/images/Ca.needs2.pdf . See also

The academic literature on the impact of parental involvement laws has not reached a
consensus. Some studies suggest that parental involvement laws lower abortion rates among
minors, but have little effect on birth rates (Rogers et al. 1991; Ohsfeldt and Gohmann 1994;
Haas-Wilson 1996; Levine 2003). Other studies suggest that the observed decline in abortions is
spurious, since abortions to minors obtained outside their state of residence are often not
recorded (Cartoff and Klerman 1986; Henshaw 1995; Joyce and Kaestner 1996; Ellertson 1997).
The conflicting findings reflect the difficulty of evaluating the impact of parental involvement
laws on reproductive behavior. The canonical research design is a pre-post analysis with a
comparison group. Changes in abortion and/or birth rates among minors are compared to
changes among older teens. This seemingly straightforward test, however, is fraught with
pitfalls that have not been fully appreciated by researchers, policy makers and advocates.
In this study we extend our previous analysis of Texas’s parental notification law to
illustrate key limitations in previous work and demonstrate that correction of the methodological
problems has significant implications for policy. First, we show that large differences in the
abortion and birth rates between minors and older teens make inferences as to the effect of the
law sensitive to how abortions and births are measured, if we employ the common strategy of
using changes in reproductive outcomes among older teens as the counterfactual for minors.
Second, we demonstrate that the estimated impact of the law on birth rates changes significantly
depending on whether exposure to the law is determined based on age at the time of conception
or age at the time of delivery. Third, we provide evidence that a substantial number of 17-yearolds delay their abortion until they are 18 in order to get around the parental notification
requirement. As a result, the law induces a rise in abortions among 18-year-olds and a fall in
abortions among 17-year-olds, and estimates based on age at the time of abortion will overstate

-2-

the decline in abortions among minors. Finally, we show that even if resident teens don’t leave
the state to obtain an abortion, fewer non-residents may come into the state for an abortion.
Since all abortion data are collected by state of occurrence, a decline in minors’ abortions
associated with the law may be overstated if non-resident abortions are included in the analyses.
We conclude that differences in how exposure to the law is determined combined with seemingly
subtle behavioral responses can have a major impact on the estimated effect of parental
involvement laws on the abortion, birth and pregnancy rates of minors.

Empirical Issues Affecting Previous Studies
Data Limitations
The literature on parental involvement laws divides broadly into two types of studies:
analyses based on state aggregate data and single or multiple-state studies that use individuallevel data from state health departments. Studies based on state aggregates use data from either
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI).
The CDC collects data from the state health departments in aggregate form. Data are available
annually by state of occurrence and one other characteristic such as age or race, but not both.
The Alan Guttmacher Institute surveys abortion providers periodically as to the total number of
abortions performed in a specific year and makes available the total number of abortions
performed in a state. The AGI estimates are widely considered the most accurate, but they
provide no information on the characteristics of women that have an abortion. (Jones and Forrest
1992). Thus, neither the CDC nor the AGI aggregate data make it possible to analyze the effect
of parental involvement laws by race or any other characteristics.

-3-

The advantage of studies based on aggregate data is that most states are represented. This
permits analyses based on pooled time-series cross-sections with state fixed effects (Ohsfeldt and
Gohmann 1994; Haas-Wilson 1996; Levine 2003). On the other hand, studies using individual
level data from one or several states allow for a more refined research design. For instance,
researchers can stratify analyses by age, race, state of residence and the month of the abortion
and thereby define those exposed and unexposed to the law with greater precision (Cartoff and
Klerman 1986; Joyce and Kaestner 1996; Henshaw 1995; Ellertson 1997).

State of Residence vs. State of Occurrence
It has long been recognized that some minors, primarily older ones, who reside in a state
that enforces a parental involvement statute, will seek an abortion in a nearby state without such
requirement (Cartoff and Klerman 1986; Henshaw 1995; Joyce and Kaestner 1996; Ellertson
1997). In fact, the goal of the current legislation being considered by Congress is to limit such
non-compliance. However, it is often not appreciated that minors for whom the nearest abortion
provider is out-of-state may stop coming to that provider after the introduction of a parental
involvement statute in the provider’s state. Thus, if analyses are based on the number of
abortions that were performed within a state, then part of the observed decline in abortions to
minors associated with the law will be spurious (Cartoff and Klerman 1986; Henshaw 1995;
Joyce and Kaestner 1996; Ellertson 1997).
The CDC and AGI aggregate abortion data are reported by state of occurrence and are not
well suited for the evaluation of parental involvement laws because they will tend to
overestimate the effect of the law. In fact, evidence from analyses that use state-level data
suggests that effects are greater when based on abortions reported by state of occurrence (Haas-

-4-

Wilson 1996) and less when based on abortions by state of residence (Ohsfeldt and Gohmann
1994; Levine 2003). However, it is uncertain that the latter studies capture the abortions
obtained by minors out of state accurately. They employ the Alan Guttmacher Institute’s
estimates of abortion by age and state of residence that are produced by incorporating migration
rates of all women provided by the CDC. These estimates do not account for the possibility of
higher migration rates for minors due to parental involvement laws. Consequently, AGI
researchers warn against the use of these data for the evaluation of parental involvement laws.4
In some studies that employ individual level data from state health departments, researchers have
secured some information on abortions to minors performed outside their state of residence
(Cartoff and Klerman 1986; Joyce and Kaestner 1996; Henshaw 1995; Ellertson 1997). The
general finding from these studies is that abortions by state of occurrence fall significantly, but
the decline by state of residence is significantly less.

Age at Time of Abortion (Birth) vs. Age at Conception
Given the limitations with reported abortions, many researchers use changes in births to
minors to corroborate changes in abortions associated with parental involvement laws. A decline
in abortions to minors after enforcement of a parental involvement law will result in a rise in
births unless minors make a greater effort to avoid pregnancy or abstain from sex altogether in
response to the more restrictive environment. Yet, even when abortions and births are counted
accurately, inference as to the effect of the law is sensitive to the way exposure to the law is
determined and how minors respond with respect to the timing of the abortion.

4

Stanley Henshaw, who directed the AGI abortion survey for many years, writes,… “Thus, the estimated abortion
and pregnancy rates should not be used to assess the impact of parental involvement laws on minors’ abortion and
pregnancy rates” (Henshaw, 1997, p. 116).

-5-

In all previous studies but one, researchers have determined exposure to the law based on a
teen’s age at the time of the abortion or birth. However, three-fourths of all minors who
conceive as 17-year-olds, give birth when they are 18 years of age. Thus, a pregnant 17-year old
who carries to term because of a parental involvement law, will mostly likely give birth as an 18year old. Since the age of the mother is measured at the time of delivery and not at the point of
conception, births to 18-year-olds who may have been affected by the law during pregnancy will
not be counted if comparisons are between 17-year-olds in different states or will be included
among the controls if changes among 18-year-olds within the state serve as the counterfactual.
This form of misclassification bias drives estimates of the law’s impact on birth rates towards the
null, and may even lead to the erroneous inference that birth rates have declined or remained
unchanged in response to the law (Rogers et al. 1991; Oshfeldt and Gohmann 1994; Ellertson
1997; Joyce and Kaestner 1996; Kane and Staiger 1996; Levine 2003).
The way exposure to the law is determined affects the inferences as to the effect of the law
on minors’ abortion rate as well. A less obvious response by minors exposed to a parental
involvement statute is to delay the abortion until they turn 18. A recent analysis showed that for
minors ages 17.5 to 17.74 at the time of conception, the odds of a second trimester abortion
increased 35 percent after the introduction of a parental notification law in Texas (Joyce,
Kaestner, and Colman 2006). This suggests that many minors, for whom delaying the abortion
until after their 18th birthday is feasible, will do so. Some of them are willing to wait even if it
leads to a more risky second-trimester abortion. Such behavior causes a decline in abortions
among older 17-year-olds and a rise in abortions among 18-year-olds and leads researchers to
overestimate the impact of the law on the abortion rate of minors if exposure to the law is
determined based on age at the time of abortion.

-6-

The Appropriate Counterfactual
A common research design is to use changes in birth and abortion rates of older teens
ages 18-19 as the counterfactual for minors ages 15-17 (Rogers et al. 1991; Oshfeldt and
Gohmann 1994; Ellertson 1997; Joyce and Kaestner 1996; Haas-Wilson 1996; Kane and Staiger
1996). However, the abortion and birth rates of older teens are several times greater than that of
minors, which raises questions as to the appropriateness of the comparison group (Meyer 1995).
Large differences in the level of birth and abortion rates between minors and older teens suggest
large differences in sexual activity, contraceptive use, previous pregnancy experience, schooling
and labor market participation, all of which may affect trends in reproductive outcomes over
time.
The large difference in the birth rate between minors and older teens can make the
relative trends between the two age groups sensitive to measurement issues. In Figures 1a and
1b we show the birth rates of minors (15-17) and older teens (18-19) in the U.S. for the period
1992 to 2002.5 In Figure 1a, birth rates (births/population) are in levels and Figure 1b we present
them transformed into natural logarithms. Fitted linear trend lines and their equations are added
to each. As shown in Figure 1a, the birth rate of older teens is almost three times greater than
that of minors. The annual decline among older teens, 2.01 births per 1000, is greater than the
annual decline among minors of 1.57 births per 1000. So a comparison of year-to-year changes
in births, such as one would do in evaluating the effect of a parental involvement law, would
indicate that births declined more among older teens than minors. In contrast, when measured in
logarithms, the annual decline in the birth rate of minors is more than double the decline of older

-7-

teens (-0.051 vs. -0.024, Figure 1b), which would lead to the opposite inference in an evaluation
of a parental involvement law.
The divergence in both the levels and trend of births between older teens and minors has
important implications for the standard pre-post design with a comparison group, as
demonstrated by this example. Because of the large difference in abortion and birth rates
between minors and older teens, most researchers use relative changes (i.e., changes in
logarithms) when analyzing effects of parental involvement laws. However, the sensitivity of
inferences to measurement undermines the internal validity of the research design, as there is no
a priori reason to favor one form of measurement over another. One solution is to use changes in
birth or abortion rates of minors in states without a law as a counterfactual. However,
differences between states with respect to the quality of data on abortions, the availability of
abortion services, employment opportunities, welfare policies, demographic differences
introduces other potential sources of confounding.

Texas’s Parental Notification Law
In a recent analysis, we compared changes in birth and abortion rates among minors and
older teens in Texas before and after enforcement of its parental notification law in January,
2000 (Joyce, Kaestner and Colman 2006). An innovation of the study was that we had
information on teen’s age at the time of conception and thus were able to identify exposure to the
law more accurately. Furthermore, knowledge of the exact age at the time of conception enabled
us to stratify the analysis by age in months, and thus narrow the age difference between the
exposed and the comparison group. In Joyce et al. (2006) we found a reduction in the abortion
rate of minors (ages 15, 16 and 17) relative to 18-year-olds after the law, but no change in

-8-

relative birth rates. However, when we restricted the analysis to teens closer in age, we found
that the birth rate of 17.5-17.74 year-olds increased relative to 18.0-18.24 year-olds after the law.
In this study, we extend our previous analysis in two primary ways. We provide
difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of Texas’ parental notification law on abortion
and birth rates illustrating how the use of relative vs. absolute changes affects the evaluation of
parental involvement laws. These estimates are initially obtained using age at the time of the
abortions or birth, and then using age at the time of conception. The purpose of this is to
demonstrate the magnitude of the bias and its significance for inference if exposure to the law is
not identified appropriately.
Next, we use the difference-in-differences estimator to evaluate the impact of the parental
notification law on the probability of abortion, given that a minor is pregnant. The regression
framework allows us to control for characteristics such as race/ethnicity, marital status and
previous pregnancies, and increases the statistical power in separate analysis by race. We also
test whether the law’s impact is changing over time. Finally, we demonstrate the number of
abortions that were performed in Texas to non-residents by age before and after the
implementation of Texas’s parental notification law.

Data
We obtained individual birth certificates for the years 1992 to 2003 and abortion
certificates from the period 1997 to 2003 from the Texas Department of State Health Services
(DSHS). Data on abortions from Texas are unique along several dimensions. First, the abortion
certificates include the patient’s exact date of birth (in month/day/year format) and the exact date
of the abortion. This information, combined with a clinical estimate of gestation, makes it

-9-

possible to estimate the date of conception as well as age at conception, which allows us to
identify the exposed and unexposed groups relatively precisely. Similarly, the birth certificates
contain information on the mothers’ date of birth as well as the date of delivery. Thus, we were
able to measure a teen’s age at the time of conception as well as at the time of the abortion or
birth. Second, Texas is the most populous state in the country after California. The large census
allowed us to stratify the analysis by race/ethnicity as well as by single year of age, and in some
analyses, by age in months. Third, all states that border Texas with the exception of New
Mexico, enforce parental involvement laws and the border between Texas and New Mexico is
relatively unpopulated except for the El Paso area. Consequently few minors in Texas leave the
state for an abortion, which mitigates the problem of not having information on minors that
obtain their abortion out of state, a major limitation in previous analyses.6
The disadvantage of using the Texas data is that we cannot obtain comparable
information on abortions from nearby states and must construct comparison groups from within
Texas. None of the states that border Texas have comparative data. In Louisiana and New
Mexico, statutory restrictions limit (or prohibit) the release of induced terminations at the
individual level. Oklahoma did not collect data on induced terminations until 2000. Arkansas
makes data available to researchers, but the abortion certificate does not report the patient’s exact
date of birth. Another limitation of the data from Texas abortion certificates is that reporting of
date of birth is incomplete for the years 1997 and 1998. However, reporting has improved over
time. For instance, 3419 (24.1 percent) of induced termination certificates lacked the patient’s
exact date of birth in 1997, 1278 (9.9 percent) in 1998, 389 (3.0 percent) in 1999, 44 (0.4
percent) in 2000, 911 (8.5 percent) in 2001, 2 (0.02 percent) in 2002 and 2 (0.02 percent) in

2003. In contrast, the mother’s date of birth is well recorded on birth certificates: less than one
percent lacked this information each year. We excluded cases in which data were missing on the
exact date of birth. To limit the possibility of bias associated with these exclusions, we limit
most analyses to one year before and one year after the law, a time period during which there
were relatively few missing data.

Results
Changes in Levels vs. Changes in Logarithms
In Table 1 we display abortion, birth and pregnancy rates of minors and older teens the
year before and one year after the enforcement of Texas’s parental notification law. The rates in
Table 1 are constructed based on age at the time of abortion or birth, in order to produce
estimates comparable to previous studies. Consider abortions first. The abortion rate of minors
ages 15-17 fell from 11.4 per thousand in 1999 to 9.0 in 2000, a 23 percent reduction as
measured by the difference in the natural logarithm of the rates (Table 1, Panel A, column 4).
The abortion rate of older teens ages 18-19 fell only 5 percent during the same period, from 29.5
to 28.1. If we use the change among older teens as an estimate of the change that would have
been observed among minors in absence of the law, then we obtain a decline associated with the
law of 18 percent based on the difference-in-differences (DD) in logs (Table 1, Panel A, column
6; p<0.01). The same comparison of births indicates that the birth rate of minors fell by 2.3 per
thousand or 6 percent in the year after the law and the birth rate of older teens fell by 2.0 per
thousand or approximately 2 percent (Table 1, Panel B, columns 3 and 4). Thus the estimated
reduction in the birth rate of minors associated with the law is 4 percent when measured in

- 11 -

relative terms (Table 1, Panel B, column 6; p<0.01), but no statistically significant change is
observed when measured in levels (Table 1, Panel B, column 5).
The sensitivity of the DD estimates to whether changes are measured in levels or logs
reflects the large differences in pre-law outcomes between minors and older teens. The abortion
and birth rates of older teens is almost three times greater than that of minors. One alternative
for researchers is to focus only on the estimates based on relative changes, but there is little
justification for this. The large discrepancy in the level of birth and abortion rates between
minors and older teens reflects differences in sexual activity, contraception, schooling and
maturity. They also may reflect differences in trends as we showed in Figures 1a and 1b, which
undermines the appropriateness of using older teens as a comparison group for minors (Meyer
1995).
In an effort to narrow the pre-law difference in abortion rates between those exposed and
unexposed to the law, we limit the comparison to 17- and 18-year-olds in the next set of
analyses. In Panels D and E of Table 1 we compare changes in abortion and birth rates before
and after the law among this subgroup of teens. Again we measure age at the time of the
abortion or birth. Inferences are now consistent regardless of whether we measure the change in
levels or in logs. The DD estimates indicate that the abortion rate of 17-year-olds fell 3.5 per
thousand or 26 percent more as compared to 18-year-olds (Table 1, Panel D, columns 5 and 6).
Similarly, the DD estimate for birth rates indicate that the birth rate of 17-year-olds fell 4.6 per
thousand or 7 percent more than that of 18-year-olds (Table 1, Panel E columns 5 and 6).

- 12 -

Age at the Time of Abortion (Birth) vs. Age at Conception
An important limitation in previous studies of parental involvement laws has been the use
of age at the time of the birth or abortion instead of age at conception. In Panels A and B of
Table 2 we compare the abortion and birth rates between 17- and 18-year-olds based on age at
the time of conception instead of age at the time of the abortion or birth. The relative decline in
the abortion rate of 17-year-olds when age is measured at the time of conception is -1.91 per
thousand, or -15 percent (Table 2, Panel A, columns 5 and 6), which is substantially less than the
estimated reduction based on age at the time of the abortion (-3.53 in levels and -0.26 in logs;
Table 1). In the case of birth rates, differences are even more dramatic. When age is measured
at the time of conception, the birth rate of 17-year-olds rises by 2.76 births per thousand (p<0.1),
or 2 percent (Table 2, Panel B, columns 5 and 6), while estimates based on age at the time of
birth suggest a relative decline in the birth rate of 17-year-olds. Thus, when age is measured at
the time of abortion or birth, Texas’s parental notification law is associated with a large decline
in the abortion rate accompanied by a reduction in the birth rate of 17-year-olds. This is in stark
contrast to the estimates based on age at conception, which suggest that Texas’s parental
notification law is associated with a smaller reduction in the abortion rate and an increase in the
birth rate of 17-year-olds when measured in levels, and no change in their birth rate when
measured in logs.
As a further indication of the importance of appropriately characterizing exposure to the
law, we combine the results for abortion and birth rates in order to analyze the change in
pregnancy rates by age at the time of abortion or birth versus age at conception. We define the
pregnancy rate as the sum of birth and abortion rates. Again we focus on the comparison of 17
and 18-year-olds in Panel F of Table 1 and Panel C of Table 2. According to the results, when

- 13 -

age is measured at the time of the birth or abortion, Texas’s parental notification law is
associated with an 11 percent decline in the pregnancy rate of 17-year-olds (Table 1, Panel F,
column 6), a figure close to the decline claimed by advocates of parental involvement laws in
California (see footnote 1). However, we uncover no change in the pregnancy rate of 17-yearolds when age is measured at the time of conception (Table 2, Panel C, column 6).

Other Behavioral Responses
As we noted above, minors may respond to a parental involvement law in ways that led
researchers to overestimate the magnitude of the decline in abortions given how data are
collected. This is precisely the result we showed earlier. The abortion rate of 17-year-olds
declined 26 percent when measured by age at the time of the abortion, but only 15 percent when
measured by age at conception. The discrepancy is due to the behavioral response of older
minors to the parental involvement law. The data suggest that older minors delay their
termination until they are 18 years of age, in order to avoid the parental notification requirement.
This causes an increase in abortions to 18-year-olds and a decrease in abortions to 17-year-olds
when age is measured at the time of the abortion, thus exaggerating the relative decline in the
abortion rate of 17-year-olds. As evidence, we show the number of abortions by age in months
for 17 and 18-year-olds, first by age at the time of abortion (Figure 2a) and separately by age at
the time of conception (Figure 2b). We show two series: the number of abortions to teens who
conceived in 2000, the year after the law, and the number of abortions conceived in 1999, the
year prior to the law.7 In both figures, the number of abortions to all 18-year-olds is practically
the same in 1999 and 2000. As expected from the results in Table 2, which show that Texas’s
law reduced abortions among 17-year-olds compared to 18-year-olds, the number of abortions to
7

Note, the pre-law year 1999 is the 12 months from August 1998-July 1999.

- 14 -

17-year-olds is noticeably less in 2000 than in 1999 in both figures. But more importantly, in
conception year 2000, there is a noticeable dip in the number of abortions among minors 17
years and 10 or 11 months of age and a jump in abortions to minors who were exactly 18 years
of age at the time of abortion (Figure 2a). The difference in the number of abortions between
minors 17 years and 11 months and teens 18 years and 0 months at termination is 173 in 2000.
In contrast, the number of abortions for conception year 1999 steadily increases with age. There
were 264 abortions to minors who were 17 years and 11 months at the time of the termination
and 305 abortions to teens who were exactly 18 years old, a change of only 41 abortions
compared with 173 in 2000.
The estimated impact of the law is markedly different when age is measured at the time
of conception, as demonstrated in Figure 2b. Unlike in Figure 2a, in Figure 2b we observe a
continuous increase in the number of abortions with age for both 1999 and 2000. As in Figure
2a the number of abortions among 17-year-olds is noticeably less in 2000 as compared to 1999,
however, there is no sharp discontinuity in the number of abortions in 2000 between minors who
conceived a few months before their 18th birthday and teens who conceived within a month of
their 18th birthday. Instead, the difference in the number of abortions between 1999 and 2000
gradually diminishes as age of conception approaches 18. The contrast between Figures 2a and
2b strongly suggest that there was a substantial number of minors who would have terminated
the pregnancy while still 17 prior to the law, but who delayed the termination until they were 18
years of age one year after the law.
Figure 3 provides another way of presenting the impact of the law on the timing of
abortion. The graph shows that of all abortions to minors who were 17 at the time of conception,
the proportion that were performed at age 18 increased from 22 percent to 27 percent between

- 15 -

1999 and 2000. As a comparison, Figure 3 also presents the proportion of abortions to 18-yearolds at the time of conception that were performed at age 19. This latter group of teens had no
incentive to delay their abortion due to the law. As is evident, among teens that were 18 at the
time of conception and obtained an abortion, there is little change in the proportion who aborted
at age 19.
Another behavioral response to parental involvement laws is that minors may leave their
state of residence to obtain an abortion in a state without a parental involvement requirement
(Cartoff and Klerman 1986; Henshaw 1995; Joyce and Kaestner 1996). Because abortion data
are collected by state of occurrence, part of the observed decline in minors’ abortion will be
spurious if these out-of-state abortions are not counted. There is little evidence that minors in
Texas sought abortions in other states (Joyce, Kaestner, and Colman 2006). The most apparent
reason is that Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma, three bordering states, already enforced or
were in the process of implementing similar statutes. However, researchers may also
overestimate the decline in abortions if non-resident minors stop coming into the state for an
abortion. Table 3 shows the number of abortions to non-residents of Texas that were performed
in Texas by age and state of residence, for the conception years 1999 and 2000. Most nonresident minors that obtained an abortion in Texas came from three bordering states, Louisiana,
New Mexico and Oklahoma, and from the country of Mexico. The total number of non-resident
abortions among 17-year-olds fell from 124 to 70 whereas abortions to non-resident 18-year-olds
fell inconsequentially from 155 to 152 between 1999 and 2000. The difference in the decline in
abortions between 17- and 18-year-olds is statistically significant (p<0.01). There was no
meaningful change in the number of non-resident abortions among 15- and 16-year-olds (see
footnote to Table 3).

- 16 -

The results in Table 3 are consistent with findings from several other studies as to
differences in behavior by age among minors. For instance, 17-year-olds are the least likely to
communicate with their parents regarding an abortion or use of reproductive health services
relative to younger minors, which suggests that they are most likely to be affected by a parental
involvement statute (Henshaw and Kost 1992; Jones et al. 2005). The 41 percent decline in nonresident abortions to 17-year-olds relative to 18-year-olds indicates that parental notification
laws are effective in discouraging non-resident older minors from obtaining an abortion in the
state. Furthermore, the lack of minors from Mississippi, Arkansas, or Tennessee—states with
parental involvement laws that are further away from Texas—suggests that a minor’s travel
across state lines is limited to nearby urban areas. In Texas, for example, over 95 percent
(n=128) of minors 15 to 17 years of age from Oklahoma obtained their abortions in Dallas
County in 1999 and 2000. Eighty-one percent (n=162) of minors from New Mexico went to El
Paso county and 14 percent (n=28) went to Lubbock county for an abortion. Sixty percent
(n=101) of minors from Mexico went to El Paso County and 24 percent (n=41) went to Webb
County in which the city of Laredo is located. The finding that most non-resident minors travel
to the nearest urban center in Texas for an abortion likely explains why so few minors from
Texas left the state for an abortion. Among the border states, New Mexico and Oklahoma did
not enforce a parental involvement law in 2000.8 But for minors in the population centers of
Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio the nearest abortion provider in New Mexico is hundreds of
miles away.

8

The Oklahoma legislature introduced a bill limiting minors’ access to abortion in 1999. As of 2002, the law was
declared unenforceable (NARAL 2003).

Pregnancy Resolution
In this section we analyze the effect of Texas’s parental notification law on the
conditional probability of an abortion given pregnancy. We define a pregnancy as a conception
that results in a live birth or an induced abortion. An advantage of pregnancy resolution as an
outcome is that we can conduct multivariate analyses at the individual level and test for
differential effects by age, race and year of conception.9 The basic regression is as follows:
(1) Pit = α 0 + β Ai + αYt + γ ( Ai * Yt ) + Xπ + eit
where Pit is the probability that teen i who conceived in year t aborts; Yt is a dichotomous
indicator of the year after the law; Ai is a dichotomous indicator for minors, more specifically of
those age 17 at the time of conception; Ai*Yt is the interaction of year and age; X is a vector of
characteristics that includes indicators for race/ethnicity, previous live births, previous induced
abortions, marital status at the time of the birth or abortion and health service region of
residence.10 We use a linear probability model which simplifies interpretation as well as the
estimation of the standard errors given the extensive set of interactions that we include.11 Results
from the estimation of the basic specification are shown in Table 4. The conditional probability
of an abortion among 17- relative to 18-year-olds fell 2.2 percentage points in the first year after
the law (Table 4, column 1). This represents a 13 percent decline given a mean conditional
probability of abortion for 17-year-olds of 0.165. Next, we tested whether the effect of the law

9

A limitation of abortion conditional on pregnancy as an outcome is that it obscures the association between the law
and probability of becoming pregnant. However, as we demonstrated in Table 2, Texas’s parental notification law
was not associated with a change in pregnancy rates, which suggests that most minors, in the short run at least, do
not respond to the law until they become pregnant.
10
Texas is divided into 11 health service regions. For a map go to:

The mean of Pit is 0.165 and thus LPM and the logit give similar results. See Ai and Norton (2003) for an
explanation of the standard errors of the marginal effects in the case of logit and probit.

on the probability of aborting a pregnancy changed over time.12 We found a 1.9 percentage point
decline in 2001 (p<0.01) and a 1.6 percentage point decline in 2002 (p<0.01) relative to 1999 but
we cannot reject the null of no difference in the mean decline by year (Table 4, column 2). Since
the estimates suggest no statistically significant difference in the effect of the law over time, in
the next model we combine all three years (2000-2002) into one after period and test whether the
effect of the law differs by race (Table 4, column 3). We show the difference-in-differences
estimates by race/ethnicity as well as test whether the results differ by race and ethnicity. The
probability of an abortion among white non-Hispanics who are 17 years of age at conception
falls 2.3 percentage point in 2000-2002 relative to 1999 (p<0.01). We find no change in
pregnancy resolution among black non-Hispanics and obtain a decline of 2.1 percentage points
among Hispanics (p<0.01) associated with the law. The difference in the DD estimates between
whites and blacks is statistically significant (p<0.10).
The racial differences in pregnancy resolution are consistent with racial and ethnic
differences in communication between minors and parents about the use of reproductive health
services (Jones et al. 2005; Reddy, Fleming and Swain 2002). In a recent survey of minors at
family planning clinics, 53.1 percent of Hispanics, 58.1 of white non-Hispanics and 75.9 of black
non-Hispanics reported that their parents knew of their use of the clinic’s services (Jones et al.
2005). In an earlier study, researchers reported that parents of African-American girls were more
likely to know that the minor sought an abortion than were the parents of white girls (Henshaw
and Kost 1992). In other words, laws that mandate communication between parents and minors
regarding the use of reproductive services should have less impact among black non-Hispanics
as compared to white-non-Hispanics and Hispanics.
12

For the conception year 2001, 640 (7.2%) of abortion records with reported age at the time of abortion of 17-19
lacked mother’s date of birth and thus were excluded from the analysis. The exclusion of these records may bias the
estimated effect of the law for the year 2001. The bias will depend on the distribution of missing records by age.

Conclusions
Voters in California and Oregon will decide this November whether to enforce a parental
notification law for minors seeking an abortion. Advocates for such laws cite social science
research that shows that parental involvement laws lower both abortions and pregnancies to
minors. In this paper, we show that results from previous studies as to the likely impact of these
laws are biased due to methodological limitations and therefore should be interpreted with
caution. With unique data on abortions and births from Texas, we show that data limitations,
questionable comparison groups and the difficulty in accurately measuring exposure to such laws
can lead to erroneous inferences. We emphasize that correction of these methodological
problems is important given the controversy surrounding abortion and the need of voters and
policymakers to accurately assess the likely impact of such laws.
We have three main findings. First, we showed that due to large differences in the birth
rates between 15-17 and 18-19 year-olds, the standard difference-in-differences estimates that
are based on these two groups are sensitive to functional form. Consequently, we emphasized
results obtained from the comparison of 17- and 18-year-olds in order to narrow the difference in
the pre-law abortion and birth rate between the exposed and unexposed groups. Second, we
demonstrated the importance of identifying those affected and unaffected by the law during
pregnancy based on age at conception instead of age at the outcome of the pregnancy. We found
that Texas’s parental notification law was associated with a fall in abortion rates but no change in
pregnancy rates when exposure to the law is determined by age at conception, a finding contrary
to a recent analysis of parental involvement laws in all 50 states (Levine 2003). Our study also
suggests that some older minors delay their abortion until they are 18 years of age in response to
the law. Prior research has been unable to account for such behavior and have likely

- 20 -

overestimated the impact of parental involvement laws on minors’ abortion rates. Finally, our
results suggest that parental notification laws are effective in discouraging non-resident minors
from obtaining an abortion in the state. This introduces an additional bias into the analyses if
abortions are measured by state of occurrence, as is the case in previous studies that utilize the
AGI estimates or the aggregate CDC data. In sum, Texas’s parental notification law had a
significant impact on the behavior of minors residing inside and outside the state. We would
expect similar responses in California and Oregon if parental notification becomes law and
access to out-of-state abortion providers that do not require parental notification is restricted by
federal legislation.
