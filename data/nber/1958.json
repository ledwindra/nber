    "abstract": "\n\nActive portfolio management is commonly partitioned into two types of\nactivities: market timing, which requires forecasts of broad-based market\nmovements, and security analysis, which requires the selection of individual\nstocks that are perceived to be underpriced by the market. Merton (1981) has\nprovided an inciteful and easily-implemented means to place a value on market\ntiming skills. In contrast, while a normative theory of stock selection was\noutlined long ago in Treynor and Black's (1973) work, no convenient means of\nvaluing potential selection ability has yet been devised.\nWe present a framework in which the value of a security analyst can be\ncomputed.  We also treat market timing ability in this framework, and\ntherefore can compare the relative values of each type of investment\nanalysts. We find that stock selection is potentially extremely valuable, but\nthat its value depends critically on the forecast interval, on the correlation\nstructure of residual stock returns, and on the ability to engage in short\nsales. Finally, we show how to modify the value of selection for the\nimportant case in which analysts' forecasts of stocks' alphas are subject to\nerror.\n\n",
