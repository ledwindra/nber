CYCLICAL PRICING OF DURABLE GOODS

ABSTRACT

I examine price markups in monopolisticly-competitive markets that
experience fluctuations in demand because the economy experiences cyclical
fluctuations in productivity.

Markups depend positively on the average

income of purchasers in the market.

For a nondurable good average income of

purchasers is procyclical; so the markup is procyclical.

For a durable good.

however. the average income of purchasers is likely to decrease in booms
because low income consumers of the good concentrate their purchases in boom
periods; so the markup is likely countercyclical.
for growing markets.

This is particularly true

I find markups make the aggregate economy fluctuate

more in response to productivity if goods are sufficiently durable.
