International Evidence on the Demand for Money

ABSTRACT

One of the current questions in the literature on the demand for money
is whether the adjustment of actual to desired money holdings is in nominal

or real terms. This paper describes a simple procedure than can be used to
test the nominal against the real hypothesis. The test is carried out for
27 countries. The paper also tests the structural stability of the demand
for money equations and the correctness of the dynamic specification.
The results are strongly in favor of the nominal adjustment hypothesis.

The estimated equations are quite good in terms of the number of coefficient

estimates that are of the right sign and that are significant. The
equations also stand up well when tested against a more general dynamic

specification. There is, however, some evidence of structural instability
before and after 1973, although the instability is generally moderate. The
instability does not affect the conclusion that the nominal adjustment
hypothesis dominates the real adjustment hypothesis.

INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE DEMAND FOR MONEY

by
Ray C. Fair
I.

Introduction

One of the current questions in the literature on the demand for money
is whether the adjustment of actual to desired money holdings is in nominal

or real terms.2 This paper describes a simple procedure that can be used to
test the nominal against the real hypothesis. The test is carried out for
27 countries. The paper also tests the structural stability of the demand
for money equations and the correctness of the dynamic specification.

II. The Model and Test
The typical demand for money model begins by postulating that the long-

run desired level of real money balances (M/P) is a function of real
income

and a short-term interest rate (re). The equation is usually

specified in log form. The functional form used here is:

(1) log(M/P)

+

log y +

rt

The log form has been used except for the interest rate. Interest rates can
at times be quite low, and it may not be sensible to take the interest rate

1The research described in this paper was financed by a grant from the
National Science Foundation. I am indebted to Dan Thornton for helpful
discussions and to a referee for useful comments.
2The seminal paper by Chow (1966) used the real adjustment process.
Goldfeld (1973, 1976) used both, but ended up focusing on the nominal
process. Recent papers include Hafer (1985), Hafer and Hem (1980), Hwang
(1985), Milbourne (1983), Spencer (1985), and Thornton (1985, 1986). A
recent survey of demand for money equations is in Judd and Scadding (1982).

variable to be in log form. If, for example, the interest rate rises from
.02 to .03, the log of the interest rate rises from -3.91 to -3.51, which is

a change of .40. If, on the other hand, the interest rate rises from .10 to
.11, the log of the rate rises from -2.30 to -2.21, which is only a change

of .09. One does not necessarily expect a one percentage point rise in the
interest rate to have four times the effect on the log of desired money

holdings when the change is from a base of .02 than when it is from a base
of .10.

It may be a better approximation simply to use the level of the

interest rate in an equation like (1) instead of the log of the rate, and

this has been done here. Results are, however, presented below for both the
level and log specifications.
If the adjustment of actual to desired money holdings is in real terms,
the adjustment equation is:

(2) log(M/P) -

log(M1/P1)

—

A{1og(M/P)

-

log(M1/P1)]

+

Ct

If the adjustment is in nominal terms, the adjustment equation is:
(3) log M - log

M1 (log M - log M1) +

Combining (1) and (2) yields:

(4) log(M/P) =

.a + plog y +

7r

+

(lA)log(M1/P1)

+

Combining (1) and (3) yields:

(5) log(M/P) = Aa + Alog y +

1r + (lA)log(M1/P)

+

Equations (4) and (5) differ in the lagged money term. In (4), which is the
real adjustment specification, M1 is divided by -1' whereas in (5),

2

which is the nominal adjustment specification, Mtl is divided by
A test of the two hypotheses is simply to put both lagged money

variables in the equation and see which one dominates. If the real

adjustment specification is correct, log(M1/P1) should be significant
and log(M1/P) should not, and vice versa if the nominal adjustment
specification is correct. This test may, of course, be inconclusive in that
both terms may be significant or insignificant. In the present case,
however, as will be seen, the test is rarely inconclusive.

One must be concerned in the estimation of (4) and (5) about the
Because of this, the equations have

possible endogeneity of y, rt, and

been estimated by two stage least squares (2SLS). The first stage
regressors that were used are mentioned in the next section. This
estimation work is based on the assumption that Mt is an endogenous

variable. If Mt were set exogenously by the monetary authority, then the
demand for money equation should not be estimated by 2SLS with M on the
left hand side. In this case rt should be on the left hand side, with only
and

as endogenous explanatory variables.

It may also be the case that the error terms are serially correlated,

and, as discussed in the next section, this has been taken into account in

the estimation. The equations have been estimated in per capita terms,

which means that M has been divided by P0}' and Mi has been divided by
where POP is the population of the country.

III. The Data and Results
The data that have been used are part of my multicountry model (Fair

(1984)). The data are quarterly. Money demand equations have been

3

estimated for 27 countries. The non U.S. data are from the International
Financial Statistics of the IMF except for the data on GNP for the OECD

countries, which are data from the OECD. For each country except the United
States the variables are as follows. M is the money supply, seasonally

adjusted when available. r is a short-term interest rate. The interest
rate that seemed to correspond most closely to short-run money market

conditions was chosen for each country. In a few cases the only short-term
interest rate avaiable was the discount rate, and so this rate had to be

used. y is real CNP, and P is the GNP deflator. In some cases quarterly
CNP data were not available, and in these cases quarterly data were

constructed by interpolation. The industrial production index was typically
used as the quarterly interpolation variable. POP is the population of each
country. The data on population are annual, and quarterly data were
constructed by assuming that the change in population in each of the four
quarters of the year is the same.3
The money demand equations for the United States are part of my U.S.

model (also in Fair (1984)). There are three relevant equations: an
equation explaining the demand for money by households, an equation
explaining the demand for money by firms, and an equation explaining the

demand for currency. (Money includes demand deposits and currency.) The
data on demand deposits and currency are from the Flow of Funds Accounts.

3See Fair (1984), Appendix B, for a complete description of the data.
The data have been updated for purposes of this paper. The sample period
listed in Table 1 below for each country shows the period over which the
data were collected for that country. The sample periods begin four
quarters after the quarter for which data on all relevant variables are
available. They end at the latest available data. In Fair (1984) all the
GNP data were taken from the IMF. For this paper, as noted above, the GNP
data for the OECD countries have been taken from the OECD.
4

They are end-of-quarter data. y for the household equation is real
disposable income, and y for the firm and currency equations is the real
level of sales.

r for the equations is the after-tax three-month Treasury

bill rate.

All equations include a constant term. The non U.S. equations also
include three seasonal dummy variables. Most of the GNP data are not
seasonally adjusted for countries other than the United States, and some of

the money data are also not seasonally adjusted. The seasonal dummy
variables are meant to pick up unaccounted for seasonal effects.

The first set of results is presented in Table 1. Except for four
countries, the equations have been estimated by 2SLS.4 The first stage
regressors used for each country are the main predetermined variables in my

multicountry model for that country. About 18 first stage regressors per
country were used. Each equation was first estimated under the assumption
of a first order autoregressive error term. If the t-statistic of the
estimate of the autoregressive coefficient was less than two in absolute
value, the equation was reestimated under the assumption of no

autoregressive error term.5 The column in Table 1 labelled "First "

4The four countries are Turkey, Colombia, India, and Pakistan. The
sample periods seemed too short for these countries for the use of 2SLS to
make much sense. The equations for these countries were estimated by
ordinary least squares.
5This is one way of testing for the presence of an autoregressive
error. Provided that one has a consistent estimate of the autoregressive
coefficient and its standard error, the t-test is valid asymptotically even
if there are endogenous and lagged endogenous variables among the
explanatory variables, which is the case in this paper. The equations in
the serial correlation case were estimated using the method in Fair (1970).
Even though the Durbin-Watson statistic is biased towards two when
there is a lagged dependent variable in the equation, it is still a useful
summary statistic. If the DW statistic is not close to two when there is a
lagged dependent variable in the equation, there are likely to be serious

contains the estimate of the autoregressive coefficient from the first

regression.6 The first and second estimates are, of course, the same if the
t-statistic of the estimate is greater than two in absolute value.

The center section of Table 1 contains the main results. The
explanatory variables in each equation include real per capita GNP, the
interest rate, the two lagged money variables, a constant, and three

seasonal dummy variables. The estimates of the constant and the
coefficients of the three dummy variables are not presented in the table to

save space. The sample periods are presented in the third-to-last column.
The sample period chosen for each country is the longest sample period that
could be chosen given the availability of the data.

The last two columns of Table 1 present partial results from another

regression. This regression is the same as the main regression expect that
the level of the interest rate has been replaced by the log of the interest

rate. The estimate of the coefficient of the log of the interest rate is
presented in the penultimate column, and the standard error of the

regression is presented in the last column. These results allow one to see
the effects of using the log of the interest rate instead of the level.
It should be noted that no "searching" was done for these results.
Each equation has the same eight explanatory variables, and the sample

serial correlation problems with respect to the error term. The DW
statistic has thus been presented in Tables 1 and 2. For the equations that
are estimated under the assumption of a first order autoregressive error
term, the summary statistics (including the DW statistic) are for the error
term that exists after transformation to eliminate the autoregressive error
component.

6Note that "First " does not mean the value of p after the first
iteration of the iterative process that is used to estimate the equation.
It is the value of p after convergence for the first regression that was
run.
6

periods have not been fiddled with to try to produce some desired result.
In what follows a variable will be said to be "significant" if the tstatistic of its coefficient estimate is greater than 2.0 in absolute value.

The results in Table 1 provide strong support for the nominal

adjustment hypothesis. In 25 of the 29 cases, the nominal lagged adjustment
variable dominates the real lagged adjustment variable in the sense of

having a higher t-statistic. In 3 cases - -

- the

-

Japan, Belgium, and Switzerland

real variable dominates. In one case - -

Finland - there

is

essentially a tie.

There are no cases in Table 1 where the coefficient estimates of both

lagged money variables are significant and positive. (Both estimates are
significant for Sweden, but the real lagged adjustment coefficient is

negative.) There are eight equations where both lagged money variables are
insigificant: Denmark, France, Switzerland, Finland, Portugal, Australia,

Colombia, and the U.S. firm equation. This insignifinance is due to the
collinarity between the two lagged money variables. When only one variable
is included, as in Table 2 below, the variable is significant. In all but
one of the eight insignificant cases, there is an obvious winner in the
sense of one variable having a larger coefficient estimate and t-statistic

than the other. (The exception is the tie for Finland.) In some of the
cases in Table 1 one lagged money coefficient is negative and the other is

greater than one. Again, this problem goes away in Table 2 when only one
variable is included in the equation. The negative coefficients in Table 1
all have smaller t-statistics in absolute value than the corresponding t-

statistics for the positive coefficients. In summary, then, the test seems
to work well. The test discriminates nicely between the two lagged money

7

variables.

Regarding the income and interest rate variables, only the equation for

Austria

has the wrong sign for both income and the interest rate. None of

the other equations have the wrong sign for income; four other equations
have the wrong sign for the interest rate, those for Sweden, South Africa,

India, and the Philippines. Eight of the 29 equations have significant
estimates of the autoregressive coefficient of the error term. All the
significant estimates are negative.

The results using the log of the interest rate are in general fairly
close to the results using the level. There are four countries, France,
Italy, Portugal, and Peru, where one form is significant and the other is

not. The log form is significant for France and Peru, and the level form is
significant for Italy and Portugal. Although not shown in Table 1, the use
of the log form resulted in only one switch regarding the dominate lagged

money variable, which was for Finland. For Finland the results using the
log form favored the nominal adjustment variable over the real adjustment
variable, whereas the results using the linear form showed a tie.

A second set of results is presented in Table 2. For this set the
lagged money variable that was dominated was dropped from the regression and

the equation was reestimated.7 In addition, for the five cases where wrong
signs for the interest rate were obtained, the interest rate was dropped.8

7The nominal adjustment specification was chosen for Finland because
there was slight evidence in favor of it when the log form of the interest
rate was used. In this case, however, the data really do not support one
hypothesis over the other.

8When the interest rate was dropped from the equation for Austria, the
coefficient estimate of the income variable became positive (although highly
insignificant), and so the income variable was left in the Austrian
equation.

The results in Table 2 are in one sense rather remarkable for macro

results, especially given the low quality data for many countries. Of the
27 estimates of the income coefficient, 20 have t-statistics greater than

two. Of the 22 estimates of the interest rate coefficient, 16 have t-

statistics

greater than two in absolute value. All the coefficient

estimates of the lagged money variables are significant and less than one.
In another sense, however, the results in Table 2 are not that strong.

Where the sample period seemed long enough for a given country, a test of
the hypothesis that the coefficients are the same before and after the first

quarter of 1973 was made. Many of the results in the literature for the
United States show an instability of the coefficients before and after 1973,

and so it is of interest to test for this. A chi-squared test was used.9
Twenty tests were performed in Table 2. The hypothesis of structural

test is as follows. The 2SLS objective function is

The1chi-squared
u'Z(Z'Z) Z'u — S, where u is a Txl vector of error terms and Z is a TxK

vector of first stage regressors. u is a function of the coefficients and
the endogenous and predetermined variables in the equation. In general u is
a nonlinear function of both coefficients and variables. If u is taken to
be the error term after transformation to eliminate first order serial
correlation, then u is a nonlinear function of the coefficients inclusive of
the serjal correlation coefficient. In this setup the serial correlation
coefficient is treated as a structural coefficient. This is the procedure
followed here.
Now, consider some set of restrictions on the coefficients. Assume

that

*
there are k restrictions. Let S be the value of S when the

error term in the unrestricted case. Then (S
distributed as chi-squared with k degrees of freedom. (See Andrews and Fair
(1986) for a general proof.)
For the test in Table 2 the restricted case is where the coefficients
before and after 1973 I are the same. The unrestriced case is where the
coefficients differ in the two sub periods.

stability was rejected at the 99 percent level in 8 cases and at the 95 but

not 99 percent level in 5 cases. It was not rejected at the 95 percent
level in 7 cases. Interestingly enough, the hypothesis was not rejected for
any of the three U.S. equations. These results thus indicate some lack of
structural stability. In only two of the rejected cases, however, were the
chi-squared values extremely large -- Japan and France. In a loose sense
one might say that the lack of stability seems moderate.
When the hypothesis of structural stability was rejected for a country,

the equation was estimated for the second sub period (1973 I to the end of

the data) with both lagged money variables included. In other words, the
test of the real versus nominal adjustment hypotheses was made for the

second sub period. Partial results from these regressions are presented in
Table 2. In only two cases, Canada and Belgium, were the results reversed
from those in Table 1 for the whole sample period. For Canada the results
switched from the nominal to the real hypothesis, and for Belgium they

switched from the real to the nominal hypotheis. The support for the
nominal adjustment hypothesis is thus not changed by restricting the
analysis to the period after 1973.

A final test of the money demand equations was made, which is a test of

the dynamic specification. Consider a model in which a variable

is

postulated to be a function of a vector of variables z. Hendry, Pagan, and
Sargan (1984) show that the model y =

+ 2tl + iy1 +

is

quite

general in that it encompasses many different types of dynamic

specifications. The present demand for money equations are based on the
implicit assumption that

is zero. This specification can thus be tested

against the more general Hendry et al. specification by including the

10

variables in

in the equation and testing whether they are significant.

The two variables in this case are log(y1/POP1) and rtl. These two
variables were added to the equations in Table 2, and a chi-squared test of
the hypothesis that the coefficients of the two variables are zero was

performed. The chi-squared values are presented in Table 2. The test has
two degrees of freedom except for the five countries where the interest rate

is excluded, where it has one degree of freedom. (For countries where the

interest rate is excluded, r1 was not added to the equation.)
The equations did much better on this test than they did on the first

test. The hypothesis was rejected at the 99 percent level in only one case
-

- Turkey - - and

it was rejected at the 95 but not 99 percent level in only

two cases -- Japan and the U.S. equation for households. The dynamic

specification of the money demand equations thus seems reasonable.

IV. Conclusion
The results of estimating money demand equations for 27 countries in

this paper are strongly in favor of the nominal adjustment hypothesis. The
equations themselves are quite good in terms of the number of coefficient

estimates that are of the right sign and that are significant. Also, the
equations stand up well when tested against a more general dynamic

specification. There is, however, some evidence of structural instability
before and after 1973, although the instability is generally moderate. The
instability does not affect the conclusion that the nominal adjustment
hypothesis dominates the real adjustment hypothesis.
