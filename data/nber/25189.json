    "abstract": "\n\nClimate change management is a global challenge that requires social science as much as it requires natural science. We provide a brief introduction to the physical science of climate change, written to provide essential background for economists and other social scientists. We also highlight some key areas in which economists\u2014including those studying macroeconomics, political economy, and development\u2014are in a unique position to help climate science advance.\n\n",
