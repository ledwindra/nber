The Fed Takes on Corporate Credit Risk: An Analysis of the Efficacy of the SMCCF
Simon Gilchrist, Bin Wei, Vivian Z. Yue, and Egon Zakrajšek
NBER Working Paper No. 27809
September 2020
JEL No. E44,E58,G2
ABSTRACT
We evaluate the efficacy of the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), a program
designed to stabilize the corporate bond market in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. The Fed
announced the SMCCF on March 23 and expanded the program on April 9. Regression
discontinuity estimates imply that these announcements reduced credit spreads on bonds eligible
for purchase 70 basis points. We refine this analysis by constructing a sample of bonds—issued
by the same set of companies—which differ in their SMCCF eligibility. A diff-in-diff analysis
shows that both announcements had large effects on credit spreads, narrowing spreads 20 basis
points on eligible bonds relative to their ineligible counterparts within the same set of issuers
across the two announcement periods. The March 23 announcement also reduced bid-ask spreads
ten basis points within ten days of the announcement. By lowering credit spreads and improving
liquidity, the April 9 announcement had an especially pronounced effect on “fallen angels.” The
actual purchases lowered credit spreads by an additional five basis points and bid-ask spreads by
two basis points. These results confirm that the SMCCF made it easier for companies to borrow
in the corporate bond market.

Introduction

Confronted with a severe turmoil in financial markets, major central banks were in the front trenches
of the policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In concert with fiscal authorities, they took
prompt and forceful actions to prevent a potential collapse of the global financial system from further damaging the real economy. Given the singular nature of the Covid-19 shock—fundamentally
a real shock arising from measures to address a public health emergency—central banks’ responses
were broad-based and tailored to country-specific financial system features. The overriding principle behind the extraordinary array of tools employed was to preserve the effectiveness of the
monetary transmission mechanism, maintain stability of the financial system, and support the flow
of credit to businesses and households (see Bank for International Settlements, 2020).
In the United States, the money market mutual fund industry came under acute pressure during
the early stages of the Covid-19 crisis, resulting in large redemptions from prime money market
funds in early March. In a dynamic eerily similar to that during the 2008-09 financial crisis,
these strains had significant knock-on effects on other short-term funding markets—particularly
on the commercial paper market—where prime money market funds are key investors. The Fed
reacted swiftly and on March 17 announced the establishment of the Commercial Paper Funding
Facility (CPFF), whose mandate was to purchase highly rated, short-term unsecured and assetbacked paper from a wide set of eligible issuers. To further shore up the critical short-term funding
markets, the Fed announced on March 18 the establishment of the Money Market Mutual Fund
Liquidity Facility (MMLF), whose purpose was to make loans to eligible financial institutions
to facilitate purchases of high-quality assets from eligible money market mutual funds, thereby
enhancing overall market functioning and the provision of credit to the broader economy.
Although these (and other) actions stemmed redemptions and averted a wider market meltdown, liquidity dried up and credit spreads continued to surge amid a global flight to safety. As
shown in Figure 1, the benchmark spread for investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds widened nearly
100 basis points—from already elevated levels—over the few days after the two announcements,
while the corresponding spread for high-yield bonds jumped 180 basis points over the same period.
In response to these escalating strains, the Fed announced on March 23 what is arguably its most
sweeping and dramatic intervention in the economy to date, the creation of the Primary Market
Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF).1
Unsurprisingly, the announcement, which market participants characterized as “whatever it
takes” and “throwing the kitchen sink” at the markets had a significant effect: The S&P 500 stock
price index rallied more than nine percent on the day, intermediate- and longer-dated Treasury
yields rose about ten basis points, and investment-grade credit spreads narrowed 20 basis points,
1
At the same time, the Fed revived the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility and expanded its quantitative easing program—launched on March 15—to include purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities in its
mortgage-backed security purchases. The Fed also noted that it expects to announce shortly another emergency
lending program—to be called the Main Street Business Lending Program—designed to support credit to small and
medium-sized businesses.

while high-yield spreads fell 30 basis points. Despite a further narrowing of credit spreads over the
remainder of that week, conditions in the corporate bond market remained strained. In response,
the Fed moved further into uncharted territory and on April 9 announced updated terms for the
two corporate bond-buying facilities. The most significant change in the updated terms was that
eligible issuers now included companies recently downgraded from investment grade—the so-called
fallen angels—an additional bold move intended to unfreeze the corporate credit markets.2
In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of the SMCCF using a variety of identification strategies.
We focus on the SMCCF because of its historic importance—the first time that the Fed supported
the corporate bond market through direct purchases of outstanding securities, in effect taking a
material amount of credit risk on its balance sheet. At the same time, evaluating the impact of the
SMCCF on market liquidity and credit spreads is complicated by the fact that the SMCCF was
announced, expanded, and, as of the date of this draft, is operating in conjunction with a number
of other emergency measures. In addition to the CPFF, MMLF, and PMCCF, these include
open-ended large-scale purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (LSAPs), the
2

The objective of the PMCCF was to support credit to businesses through the issuance of bonds and loans; this
facility was initially open to investment-grade U.S. companies The SMCCF, by contrast, was established to provide
liquidity to the market for outstanding corporate bonds. Initially, the SMCCF was only allowed to purchase in the
secondary market corporate bonds issued by investment-grade U.S. companies. As discussed more fully below, the
Fed expanded the eligibility for the two facilities on April 9 to include certain U.S. companies that were investment
grade as of March 22 but were subsequently downgraded to junk status.

Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF),
the Municipal Liquidity Facility, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF),
and the Main Street Lending Program, an extraordinary set of programs aimed at stabilizing
the financial system, cushioning the adjustment for firms and households, and restoring investor
confidence.
Given the simultaneous announcement of these various programs, it is important to focus on
identification strategies that isolate the direct effect of the SMCCF. A natural way to do this is
to analyze the effect of the Fed’s corporate bond-buying program on bonds that are eligible for
purchase relative to bonds that are not eligible for purchase by the facility. To the extent that there
are positive spillovers between these two categories of bonds—or through macroeconomic effects
in general—such estimates should be viewed as lower bounds on the likely overall impact of the
SMCCF on the corporate bond market.
We begin our analysis by exploiting a natural regression discontinuity, which arises when comparing the effect of the SMCCF on bonds eligible for purchase under the announced program
relative to bonds that are ineligible for the purchase by the facility. As discussed more fully below,
the SMCCF’s two key eligibility requirements are (i ) bonds must be rated as investment grade;
and (ii ) they must have remaining maturity of less than or equal to five years. The five-year maturity cutoff, therefore, represents a natural regression discontinuity. Moreover, it only applies to
investment-grade bonds.
Our regression discontinuity estimates confirm this intuition. Investment-grade bonds below
the five-year maturity cutoff experience a drop in credit spreads of 70 basis points, relative to
investment-grade bonds above the five-year maturity cutoff, during the post-announcement period.
Moreover, these effects occur relatively quickly—within 14 days of the April 9 announcement—and
are long lasting. We find no evidence of such discontinuities in the pre-announcement windows
before March 23, nor in an otherwise similar sample of high-yield bonds. These results imply that
the announcement of the SMCCF program had broad and long-lasting effects on credit spreads of
eligible bonds compared with their ineligible counterparts.
It is, however, possible that companies that have issued the SMCCF-eligible bonds differ in
systematic ways from companies with ineligible bonds. We therefore consider a refinement of this
strategy, whereby we construct a matched sample of eligible vs. ineligible bonds that have been
issued by the same company. This effectively allows us to control for industry characteristics, as
well as firm-specific characteristics such as size, age, and the overall degree of credit-risk exposure
faced by the firm.
Using this matched sample, we use difference in differences methods to document that the
March 23 announcement reduced credit spreads on eligible bonds relative to ineligible bonds issued
by the same company by ten basis points within a 10-day window. We obtain a similar estimate
for the April 9 announcement. Because these are non-overlapping windows, the total effect of
the program announcement lowered credit spreads on eligible bonds by 20 basis points relative to
ineligible bonds for an average issuer of both types of bonds.

3

We perform the same analysis on bid-ask spreads and find that bid-ask spreads declined by ten
basis points within a 10-day window bracketing the March 23 announcement. This result implies
that the Fed’s extraordinary actions significantly improved liquidity in the U.S. corporate bond
market. Consistent with the notion that the April 9 announcement primarily reflected the shift in
the Fed’s policy towards greater tolerance of credit risk on its balance sheet, we find no effect of
this announcement on market liquidity as measured by our proxies for bid-ask spreads.
The finding that credit spreads narrowed for eligible bonds within the same set of issuers
is therefore attributable to two broad mechanisms: An improvement in market liquidity and a
reduction in near-term default risk, relative to overall default risk (i.e., bonds with remaining
maturity of less than or equal to five years relative to bonds with remaining maturity greater than
five years). Prior to the announcement, near-term default risk increased sharply as evidenced by
the compression in the dispersion of credit spreads across the maturity spectrum. Our analysis,
therefore, suggests that the announcement of the SMCCF helped restore the upward-sloping term
structure of credit risk.
To further highlight the Fed’s role in reducing credit risk, we also consider the potential effect
of the two announcements on fallen angels. To do so, we consider all bonds issued by companies
that were rated as investment grade before March 23 but were downgraded to a notch below
investment grade during the subsequent 10 days and hence became SMCCF eligible with the April 9
announcement. We again consider a matched sample and exploit the fact that these fallen angels
have outstanding bonds that remain ineligible—owing to the five-year maturity cutoff—following
the April 9 announcement.
When compared to the matched sample of ineligible bonds, fallen angels’ eligible bonds experienced a 340 basis point increase in credit spreads during the 10-day period following the March 23
announcement. This rise in credit spreads is partly due to an increase in near-term default risk
relative to longer-term risk, as these companies were downgraded to junk status sometime during
these ten days. It may also be due to the fact that these bonds become ineligible for purchase by the
SMCCF during this same 10-day window. We then show that the April 9 announcement reversed
much of this run-up. In particular, credit spreads on newly eligible bonds issued by fallen angels
fall 250 basis points in the ten days following the April 9 announcement. We view this results as
strong evidence that the announcement of the SMCCF influenced credit spreads by significantly
reducing near-term default risk.
Lastly, we consider the effect of the facility’s implementation on credit and bid-ask spreads.
Using intra-day transactions data that exactly identify the Fed’s purchases of individual corporate
bonds, we document that credit spreads decline by five basis points upon purchase, while bidask spreads narrow by two basis points. In summary, our evidence based on both regression
discontinuity analysis of bonds eligible for purchase and a difference in differences analysis of a
matched sample of bonds issued by the same set of companies confirm that the announcement and
subsequent implementation of the SMCCF were very effective at reducing credit risk and improving
liquidity in the U.S. corporate bond market.

Our paper is related to the large empirical literature aimed at evaluating and quantifying
the effects of unconventional policy measures on financial asset prices that emerged during the
2008–09 global financial crisis. For the U.S., much of this research has focused on whether the
Fed’s purchases of large quantities of Treasuries, agency MBS and agency debt, as well as various
forms of forward guidance have lowered longer-term U.S. benchmark yields and the associated private interest rates (see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011; Gilchrist and Zakrajšek, 2013;
Gilchrist et al., 2015; Hanson and Stein, 2015). While employing a variety of empirical approaches,
a common finding that emerges from these studies is that the unconventional policy measures employed by the Fed between the end of 2008 and the end of 2015 have led to a significant reduction
in U.S. Treasury yields and that this broad-based reduction in longer-term interest rates has been
passed fully to lower borrowing costs for businesses and households.
In this paper, we study the effects of the extraordinary measures employed by the Fed to
stabilize the corporate debt markets in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, we analyze
the impact of the Fed’s March 23 announcement, which established its unprecedented corporate
bond-buying programs, and the April 9 follow-up announcement that extended the Fed’s corporate
bond purchases to certain junk-rated firms. A growing number of recent papers address related
questions. D’Amico et al. (2020) quantify the effects of the announcements associated with the
PMCCF on the corporate bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and CDX indexes. They document
that these announcements had a significant positive effect on the directly eligible ETFs, as well as
on the ETFs holding eligible bonds and their close substitutes, as evidenced by a discrete drop in
the perceived credit risk of eligible bonds, especially following the April 9 announcement.
In a similar vein, Nozawa and Qiu (2020) also document that the Fed’s announcements of
the corporate credit facilities reduced credit risk but find only mixed evidence for the liquidity
channel. In contrast, Kargar et al. (2020) show that liquidity conditions in the corporate bond
market improved notably for both bonds that were eligible for the Fed’s purchase programs as well
as for bonds that were ineligible. Finally, Haddad et al. (2020) examine the discrepancy between
the corporate bond market and its related credit derivatives (CDS) market during the Covid-19induced period of market turmoil, using the Fed’s announcements to evaluate the potential channels
of transmission.
The road map for the remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview
of the SMCCF facility. In Section 3, we describe our data sources, the construction of micro-level
credit spreads and bid-ask spreads. In Section 4, we take the first cut at our data, using a regression
discontinuity design framework, which exploits the five-year maturity cutoff for the SMCCF-eligible
bonds. Section 5 presents our main results, which rely on both the issuer- and bond-level difference
in differences approach to estimate the impact of the March 23 and April 9 announcements on credit
and bid-ask spreads. Using intra-day transactions data that exactly identify the Fed’s purchases of
individual corporate bonds, we evaluate the SMCCF’s implementation effects in Section 6. Section 7
offers a brief conclusion.

A Brief Introduction to the SMCCF

As noted above, the Fed announced on March 23 an unprecedented corporate bond-buying program
in response to severe strains in the U.S. corporate bond market. By establishing two emergency
lending facilities pursuant to Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act—the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility—the Fed committed to
buying a substantial amount of corporate debt in both the primary and secondary markets.3
The stated objective of the SMCCF, the main focus of this paper, was to provide liquidity
to the market for outstanding corporate bonds through direct purchases of individual corporate
securities and ETFs, whose primary investment objective is exposure to the broad U.S. corporate
bond market. Eligible bonds are required to have been issued by U.S. companies and have a
remaining maturity of five years or less. The maximum amount of bonds that the SMCCF will
purchase in the secondary market of any eligible issuer is capped at ten percent of the issuer’s
maximum dollar amount of bonds outstanding on any day between March 22, 2019, and March 22,
2020. The March 23 announcement stipulated that the two corporate bond-buying facilities were
open to only investment-grade U.S. companies.
On April 9, 2020, the Fed announced that the PMCCF and SMCCF would support, respectively,
$500 billion of primary market purchases and $250 billion of secondary market purchases, backed
by $75 billion provided by the Treasury Department using funding from the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). In addition, the Fed expanded the two facilities
to include certain fallen angels—companies that were rated at least BBB-/Baa3 as of March 22,
2020, and are rated at least BB-/Ba3 as of the date on which the SMCCF purchases their bonds.
The SMCCF started buying corporate bond ETFs on May 12, and individual corporate bonds on
June 16.4 On July 28, the Fed announced an extension of the two corporate bond-buying facilities—
which were initially scheduled to expire on or around September 30, 2020—through December 31,
2020.
The term sheet of the SMCCF stipulates that the facility’s direct purchases of individual securities in the secondary market will attempt to track “a broad, diversified market index of U.S.
corporate bonds.” To operationalize this notion, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published
on June 28, 2020, the initial Broad Market Listing, a set of corporate bonds eligible for purchase
by the SMCCF.5 To get a sense of what credits the SMCCF is targeting, we report in Table 1
3
As discussed by Sastry (2018), Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which was added to the act at the height
of the Great Depression in 1932, granted the Fed enormous emergency lending powers. Notably, it granted the 12
Federal Reserve Banks the authority to “discount” for any “individual, partnership, or corporation” notes “endorsed
or otherwise secured to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve Bank[s],” subject to a determination by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System of “unusual and exigent circumstances.” While the Fed’s aggressive use of
Section 13(3) during the 2008-09 financial crisis successfully stabilized the financial system, the Congress responded
to the Fed’s use of Section 13(3) by narrowing that authority in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Most importantly, any
emergency lending must now be made through a “program or facility with broad-based eligibility,” it cannot “aid a
failing financial company” or “borrowers that are insolvent,” and it cannot have “a purpose of assisting a single and
specific company avoid bankruptcy.” In addition, the Fed is prohibited from establishing a Section 13(3) program
without the prior approval of the secretary of the Treasury.

The PMCCF commenced its operations on June 29, 2020.

Data Sources and Methods

The key data used in our analysis come from the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE)
database, which contains information about individual corporate bond transactions in the secondary
market. Most importantly, the TRACE database records the date and time of individual corporate
bond transactions, transaction prices and volumes, the direction of a transaction (buy or sell),
as well as information about whether a transaction is “dealer-to-customer” or “dealer-to-dealer.”
After running the TRACE data through filters developed by Dick-Nielsen and Poulsen (2019), we
combine the resulting security-level transactions data with the information from either the Fixed
Income Securities Database (FISD) or Bloomberg to obtain bond characteristics, such as bond
type, coupon frequency, date and amount of issuance, maturity date, and credit rating.
We restrict our TRACE sample to transactions that took place between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
(EST) on business days since January 1, 2020. From this sample, we drop all transactions involving
once a month; see https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/secondary-market-corporate-credit-facility/
secondary-market-corporate-credit-facility-broad-market-index.

7

bonds with variable coupons and bonds with a remaining maturity of less that six months or
more than 30 years. These filters ensure that prices in our sample are not unduly influenced by
the potential liquidity anomalies arising from the bond’s special features, such as an impending
redemption, unusually long maturity by the standards of fixed income markets, or changes in its
promised cash flows. Moreover, as shown below, a vast majority of bonds purchased by the SMCCF
had fixed coupon; restricting our sample to fixed-coupon bonds thus facilitates comparisons with
the sample of bonds purchased by the SMCCF.
The daily price for each bond in our sample is defined as the last transaction price recorded
between 9 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on a given business day. We refer to the corresponding dollar amount
traded as the transaction amount or transaction volume.6 Following Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012),
we construct a credit spread for each bond on each trading day as the difference between the bond’s
yield-to-maturity implied by its daily price and the yield-to-maturity of a synthetic risk-free security
that mimics exactly the cash flows of the corresponding corporate bond. The yield of the synthetic
risk-free security is calculated from its hypothetical price, which is equal to the present value of the
promised cash flows, discounted by the term structure of zero-coupon Treasury yields, as estimated
on that day by Gürkaynak et al. (2007).
Using these micro-level data, we calculate the daily transaction volume weighted average credit
spreads across all bonds in our sample and the corresponding weighted average spreads for the
investment-grade and high-yield subsamples.7 In Panel A of Figure 2, we plot these three series
since the beginning of the year. Note that the investment-grade and high-yield credit spreads
constructed from the micro-level TRACE data are very similar to their respective benchmark
indexes shown in Figure 1. In fact, the correlation in levels is 0.99 for both investment-grade and
high-yield credit spreads, while in daily changes, the correlations for investment-grade and highyield credit spreads are 0.91 and 0.82, respectively. All told, our TRACE sample of corporate bonds
appears to be representative of the broad U.S. corporate bond market since the beginning of the
year.
We also use our TRACE sample of bonds to construct a proxy for bid-ask spreads, a common
measure of liquidity in financial markets. In that case, we utilize information about the type of
counterparties involved in each recorded transaction. Specifically, on each business day, we define a
bond’s “bid” price as an average of all prices generated by transactions involving customers selling
that bond to a dealer on that day. The bond’s corresponding “ask” price, by contrast, is defined
as an average of all prices generated by transactions involving dealers selling that same bond to
a customer. Lastly, we define the bond’s “mid” price as an average of all prices involving dealerto-dealer transactions. Our proxy for the bond-specific bid-ask spread is then calculated as the
difference between the bond’s bid and ask prices, divided by the mid price.
6

As a robustness check, we also defined the daily price for each bond as a weighted average of all of its transaction
prices between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on a given day, with weights equal to the corresponding transaction amounts.
Using this alternative definition had a negligible effect on all the results reported in the paper.
7
To mitigate the effects of extreme observations on our results, we winsorize our sample of credit spreads at the
1st and 99th percentiles of their distribution.

debt that was rated investment grade as of March 22 but was subsequently downgraded.

Panel B of Figure 2 shows the time series of the average bid-ask spread for all bonds in our
sample, as well the corresponding bid-ask spreads for the investment-grade and high-yield segments
of the market. As can be seen from the figure, bid-ask spreads started to rise gradually following the
acknowledgment by the Chinese officials on January 20, 2020, that Covid-19 might be transmissible
9

between humans. In late February, as the worsening news relating to the Covid-19 outbreak
roiled global financial markets, liquidity in the U.S. corporate bond market deteriorated markedly,
and bid-ask spreads shot up. The Fed’s announcements on March 23 and April 9 led to some
improvement in market functioning, though bid-ask spreads remained notably above their prepandemic levels through the end of July.

The Regression Discontinuity Approach

Our first pass at examining whether the two SMCCF announcements left an imprint in the
U.S. corporate bond market exploits the facility’s two key eligibility criteria—the bond’s timeto-maturity and its credit rating—within the regression discontinuity design (RDD) framework
(see DiNardo and Lee, 2004; Card et al., 2008). Recall that the first criterion limits the remaining
maturity of eligible bonds to five years or less, while the second requires eligible bonds to have an
investment-grade credit rating at the time of a purchase. If the SMCCF announcements had an
effect on the corporate bond market, we should observe a discontinuity in credit spreads around
the time-to-maturity cutoff of five years in the investment-grade segment of the market after the
two announcements. In other words, eligible investment-grade bonds with remaining maturity of
five years or less should have, all else equal, lower credit spreads than the eligible investment-grade
bonds with remaining maturity of more than five years. At the same time, we should see no, or
very little, such discontinuity in the high-yield segment of the market because a vast majority of
high-yield bonds is ineligible for purchase by the SMCCF.8
Using our TRACE sample of bonds, we implement the RDD as follows. In a sample window of
d (business) days strictly before the March 23 announcement (i.e., the interval [3/22 − d, 3/22]) and
in the same-length window strictly after the April 9 announcement (i.e., the interval [4/10, 4/10+d]),
we select all bonds with the remaining maturity between four and six years, a range narrowly
bracketing the SMCCF’s time-to-maturity cutoff of five years. Within each d-day window, we sort
the resulting sample of bonds into 24 maturity bins of width of one month. Thus, the first bin
contains all bonds whose remaining maturity lies in the interval (4, 4.083], the second bin spans
the maturity interval (4.083, 4.166], and the last bin covers the maturity interval (5.917, 6]. Within
each bin, we then calculate the weighted average credit spread using the corresponding transaction
volumes as weights.
This binning exercise is performed separately for investment-grade and high-yield samples of
bonds on windows of various lengths. To ensure a reasonable number of bonds in each bin, we
consider “before” and “after” announcement windows of length d = 14, 30, 60, 90 days. For each
8
Although the investment-grade rating criterion in the March 23 announcement was relaxed somewhat in the
subsequent April 9 announcement, the SMCCF still cannot purchase bonds with a rating below BB-/Ba3 at the
time of a purchase. Moreover, the actual SMCCF’s purchases are overwhelmingly skewed towards investment-grade
corporate debt, despite the fact that purchases can include bonds rated just a notch below investment grade.

window, we then estimate the following regression:
CSb = α + β × 1[TTMb ≤ 5] + p(TTMb ; θ 1 ) + p(TTMb ; θ 2 ) × 1[TTMb ≤ 5] + ǫb ,

(1)

where CSb denotes the average credit spread in bin b and 1[TTMb ≤ 5] is a 0/1-indicator function
that equals one if the time-to-maturity (TTM) of bin b is less than or equal to five years and zero otherwise. The functions p(TTMb ; θ 1 ) and p(TTMb ; θ 2 ) denote quadratic polynomials—parameterized
by vectors θ 1 and θ 2 , respectively—in TTMb , while ǫb denotes a mean-zero disturbance term.
The coefficient of interest in the RDD specification (1) is β, which measures the degree of
discontinuity in credit spreads around the SMCCF’s time-to-maturity cutoff of five years. This
discontinuity, if it exists, would reflect the average effect of the March 23 and April 9 SMCCF
announcements on credit spreads. We would expect the estimate of β to be negative and statistically
different from zero in the after-announcement windows containing investment-grade bonds. At the
same time, there should be no such discontinuity—that is, β = 0—at the five-year maturity in the
before-announcement windows and in windows containing high-yield bonds.
The results of this exercise are tabulated in Table 2. Panel A reports the (unweighted) OLS
estimates of the regression discontinuity coefficient β, while Panel B reports the corresponding
WLS estimates of β, using the bin-specific transaction amounts as weights. According to the
entries in the table, we uniformly fail to reject the null hypothesis that β = 0 in all beforeannouncement windows for both investment-grade (columns 1–4) and high-yield (columns 5–8)
subsamples. This result is robust to using both the OLS and WLS to estimate the regression
discontinuity coefficient β.
In the after-announcement windows, by contrast, there is strong evidence of discontinuity
in investment-grade credit spreads at the time-to-maturity cutoff of five years. As detailed in
columns 1–4 of Panel A, the OLS estimates of β are negative and statistically different from zero
at conventional significance levels in the 30-, 60-, and 90-day after-announcement windows containing investment-grade bonds. The corresponding WLS estimates reported in Panel B are of
similar magnitudes and are statistically different from zero at conventional significance levels in
all four after-announcement windows containing investment-grade bonds. At the same time, the
estimates of β are statistically indistinguishable from zero in the after-announcement windows containing high-yield bonds (columns 5–8). The magnitude of discontinuity in investment-grade credit
spreads is also economically significant. The range of estimates in the after-announcement windows containing investment-grade bonds indicates that the two SMCCF announcements lowered
credit spreads on eligible investment-grade bonds between 60 and 80 basis points, relative to their
ineligible counterparts.
Figure 3 provides a visual confirmation of the discontinuity in investment-grade credit spreads
for the 30- and 60-day windows based on the OLS estimates reported in Panel A of Table 2.
The discontinuity in credit spreads at the maturity cutoff of five years is clearly evident in the
after-announcement windows, especially so in the 60-day window. This window, however, extends
beyond June 16 when the Fed commenced with the actual purchases of individual corporate bonds.

The fact that the regression discontinuity coefficients based on the 60- and 90-days windows are,
in general, estimated more precisely (see Table 2) suggests that the Fed’s actual purchases had an
additional effect on credit spreads in the investment-grade segment of the market.
In Table 3, we report the results from the analogous RDD analysis of bid-ask spreads. In this
case, however, the evidence that the two SMCCF announcements led to a discontinuity in bidask spreads is less clear. The OLS estimates of β in the after-announcement windows containing
investment-grade bonds, while negative, are estimated less precisely (columns 1–4 in Panel A), and
the same is true for their corresponding WLS estimates (columns 1–4 in Panel B). In general, the
estimates of the regression discontinuity coefficients are statistically different from zero only in the
longer (i.e., 60-day and 90-day) windows. As noted above, this finding may reflect the fact that
the 60- and 90-day after-announcement windows extend beyond June 16, when the Fed started its
actual purchases of individual corporate bonds, thereby directly affecting liquidity in the market.
The absence of discontinuity in bid-ask spreads at the maturity cutoff of five years in shorter
(i.e., 14-day and 30-day) after-announcement windows could also reflect the fact that our bid-ask
spreads are noisy proxies of the true underlying bid-ask spreads, making it to difficult to identify
the regression discontinuity.

The Difference in Differences Approach

The RDD results above provide suggestive evidence that the March 23 and April 9 announcements
significantly lowered credit spreads on the SMCCF-eligible investment-grade bonds relative to their
ineligible counterparts. There are, however, two issues with those results. First, the RDD design
does not control for observable bond characteristics that can influence prices in the secondary
market. Second, the 60- and 90-day after-announcement windows extend beyond June 16—the
start date of the actual purchases—and thus the estimates of regression discontinuity coefficients
based on those windows confound the announcement and purchase effects. To address these issues,
we consider in this section an alternative approach to identify the two announcement effects on
the corporate bond market, an approach based on issuer- and bond-level data and the difference
in differences (DiD) methodology.

5.1

Constructing the “Treatment” and “Control” Groups

Using our TRACE sample of corporate bonds, we construct the “treatment” and “control” groups
as follows. First, we select all bonds whose issuer had an investment-grade rating as of March 22
and whose remaining time-to-maturity as of the March 23 announcement was less than or equal to
five years; this sample of bonds was eligible for the purchase by the SMCCF as of the March 23
announcement. For each bond in this sample, we then identify all bonds issued by the same
company, but whose remaining maturity is greater than five years; this second sample of bonds is
not eligible to be purchased by the SMCCF. To ensure a reasonable degree of maturity concordance
between these two samples of bonds, we impose the condition that the remaining maturity of the
issuer-paired bonds in the non-eligible sample cannot exceed 10 years. Note that bonds in the two
samples were all issued by the same set of companies and thus are subject to the same underlying
default risk.
Using these two samples of bonds, we construct the treatment and control groups used in our
DiD analysis. To construct the treatment group, we select from issuers with multiple bonds in
the eligible sample, bonds with the remaining maturity closest to five years. Analogously, if there
are multiple bonds in the non-eligible sample that can be paired with the bond in the treatment
group, we keep only the bond with time-to-maturity closest to five years—this sample constitutes
our control group. In addition to being subject to the same underlying default risk, a pair of bonds
from the treatment and control groups have the remaining maturity that is as close as possible.9
The blue line in the left panel of Figure 4 shows the daily average credit spread of bonds in the
treatment group, while the red line shows the corresponding average credit spread in the control
group. The blue and red lines in the right panel show the evolution of the respective average bidask spreads. Before the realization of the potential economic impact of the Covid-19 shock rattled
investor confidence in mid-February, the average credit spread in the control group was consistently
9

This matching process yielded 4,825 pairs of bonds, issued by 1,076 unique companies. The mean (median)
difference in the remaining maturity across pairs of bonds is 3.5 (3.3) years, while the 95th percentile is 6.7 years.

Note: The blue line in the left panel shows the daily average credit spreads of bonds in the treatment group (i.e.,

and SMCCF to include corporate debt that was rated investment grade as of March 22 but was subsequently

above that in the treatment group. The gap between the credit spreads in the two samples, however,
was very stable around the average of about 25 basis points. This pattern is consistent with the
fact that the average bid-ask spread in the treated sample was systematically above the average
bid-ask spread in the control sample during this period. This indicates that bonds in our treated
group were, on average, less liquid than their counterparts in the control group, possibly due to
their shorter maturity or other bond characteristics.
In the latter half of February, when fears over the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak sparked
a broad sell-off in risky assets, the gap between the two credit spread series started to close,
disappearing completely during the bout of turmoil that swept through financial markets in March.
This acute risk-on period also saw a widespread deterioration in market liquidity, as the average bidask spreads in both samples shot up and converged at elevated levels. Following the Fed’s March 23
announcement, credit spreads in both the treatment and control groups declined significantly.
Interestingly, the size of the drop in the average credit spreads in the immediate aftermath of the
announcement was virtually the same across the two groups.
The commensurate drop in credit spreads across the two groups in the wake of the March 23
announcement would suggest that what caused the spreads to narrow was not the announcement
of the corporate bond buying program per se. Rather, it was the Fed’s “whatever it takes” pledge

16

to keep the economy from collapsing under the weight of the Covid-19 pandemic, reflected in the
opening sentence of the announcement, which stated that the Fed is “committed to using its full
range of tools to support households, businesses and the U.S. economy overall.” This interpretation
is consistent with the decline in the average bid-ask spread in both samples in the days following
the March 23 announcement, an indication that this extraordinary announcement significantly
improved the overall functioning of the U.S. corporate bond market.
The Fed’s April 9 announcement, by contrast, appears to have had a more differential effect on
credit spreads in the treatment and control groups. In particular, the average credit spread in the
treated sample fell more that the average credit spread in the control sample. This suggest that the
April 9 follow-up announcement had a distinct impact on the corporate bond market. At the same
time, the April 9 announcement appears to have had no differential effect on the average bid-ask
spreads in the two groups of corporate bonds.

5.2

Econometric Methodology

Our first formal pass at quantifying the separate effects of the March 23 and April 9 announcements
on credit spreads uses the pairs of bonds in the treatment and control groups to estimate the
following issuer-level DiD specification:
CStreated
− CScontrol
= β × 1[t > t∗ ] + ηi + ǫi,t ,
i,t
i,t

(2)

where CStreated
is the credit spread on issuer i’s bond in the treatment group, and CScontrol
is the
i,t
i,t
credit spread on issuer i’s bond in the control group on the same business day t. The 0/1-indicator
variable 1[t > t∗ ] equals one if the date t is greater than the specified announcement date t∗ , either
March 23 or April 9. The issuer fixed effect ηi controls for any (time-invariant) unobservable issuer
characteristics within each event window. The coefficient β thus quantifies the difference in credit
spreads between the SMCCF-eligible and non-eligible bonds of the same issuer and comparable
maturity in response to the specified announcement.
We estimate specification (2) by OLS in symmetric 1-, 5-, and 10-day windows bracketing
the March 23 and April 9 announcements. The results of this exercise are reported in Table 4,
with Panel A containing the March 23 announcement effects and Panel B containing the April 9
announcement effects. The entries in Panel A indicate that the March 23 announcement induced a
significant—in both statistical and economic terms—narrowing of credit spreads on the SMCCFeligible bonds compared to their non-eligible counterparts. Within the 1- and 5-day windows
bracketing the announcement, the spreads on the SMCCF-eligible bonds are estimated to have
declined about 15 basis points relative to spreads on no-eligible bonds issued by the same set of
companies. The announcement effect in the 10-day window is estimated to be about ten basis
points, suggesting that the initial impact of the March 23 announcement on credit spreads waned
somewhat over time.
The estimates of the April 9 announcement effects, reported in Panel B, are smaller in magni-

tude, though still economically and statistically significant. Moreover, they increase (in absolute
terms) as we widen the event window, rising from about six basis points in the 5-day window to
12 basis points in the 10-day window. This finding suggests that the April 9 announcement had a
more persistent—though economically smaller—effect on credit spreads, a finding mirrored in the
persistent divergence between the red and blue lines shown in the left panel of Figure 4.
In Table 5, we report the results from the analogous exercise using the difference in bid-ask
spreads, BAStreated
− BAScontrol
, as the outcome variable. According to the entries in Panel A, the
i,t
i,t
March 23 announcement had a noticeable effect on the liquidity in the corporate bond market.
Within the 5-day window bracketing the announcement, bid-ask spreads on the SMCCF-eligible
bonds were estimated to decline about 15 basis points relative to bid-ask spreads on no-eligible
bonds issued by the same set of companies, while the corresponding announcement effect within
the 10-day window is about nine basis points. The April 9 announcement, in contrast, appears
to have had no differential effect on bid-ask spreads, according to the results reported in Panel B.
These results are broadly consistent with those based on the RDD approach in Table 3, which
showed that the average effect of the two announcements did not induce a clear discontinuity in
bid-ask spreads at the five-year maturity cutoff in shorter estimation windows.

and zero otherwise. In Panel A, t∗ = March 23, and in Panel B, t∗ = April 9. All specifications
include issuer fixed effects. Absolute t-statistics based on issuer-clustered standard errors are reported
in brackets: * p < .10; ** p < .05; and *** p < .01.

A potential limitation of the DiD analysis at the issuer level is that the pairs of bonds in the
treatment and control groups—while having a reasonably comparable maturity—could differ in
other characteristics that influence their prices. To take into account these confounding factors, we
use the treated and control samples to estimate the following bond-level DiD specification:

CSi,j,t = β × 1[j ∈ SMCCF] × 1[t > t∗ ] + γ1 × 1[j ∈ SMCCF] + γ2 × 1[t > t∗ ]
+ θ′ Xi,j,t + ηi + ǫi,j,t ,

(3)

where i indexes issuers and j indexes their outstanding bonds. In this specification, CSi,j,t denotes
the credit spread on bond j, a liability of issuer i, on business day t. The indicator variable
1[j ∈ SMCCF] equals one if bond j was eligible for purchase by the SMCCF as of March 22 and
zero otherwise, while the indicator variable 1[t > t∗ ] is defined as above.
The main coefficient of interest in this DiD specification is β on the interaction term 1[j ∈
SMCCF] × 1[t > t∗ ], which measures the difference in credit spreads between the SMCCF-eligible
bonds and their ineligible counterparts that can be attributed to the specified Fed announcement.
If the specified announcement in fact eased borrowing conditions in the corporate bond market,
we would expect β to be negative and statistically different from zero. To control for the fact
19

that bonds in the treated sample differ in certain dimensions from those in control sample, the
specification also includes a vector of pre-determined covariates—denoted by Xi,j,t —comprising of
the bond’s remaining days-to-maturity, its age (i.e., the number of days since it was issued), coupon
rate, and the logarithm of the par amount issued.
As before, we estimate specification (3) by OLS in symmetric 1-, 5-, and 10-day windows
bracketing the March 23 and April 9 announcements. The results of this exercise are reported
in Table 6, with Panel A containing the March 23 announcement effects and Panel B containing
the April 9 announcement effects. The results from the baseline DiD specifications are reported
in columns 1–3 of each panel. As a robustness check, we report in columns 4–6 estimates of the
corresponding coefficients based on the DiD specifications that also include time fixed effects, which
capture common shocks affecting the spreads on bonds in both the treatment and control groups;
in the latter case, the coefficient on the indicator variable 1[t > t∗ ] is not separately identified.
The results reported in both panels of Table 6 are remarkably similar to those reported in
Table 4. Our baseline estimates of β—the coefficient on the interaction term 1[j ∈ SMCCF] × 1[t >
t∗ ]—based on the bond-level data indicate that the March 23 announcement led to a relative decline
in credit spreads of 11, 15, and nine basis points in the 1-, 5-, and 10-days windows, respectively
(columns 1–3 in Panel A). These magnitudes are very similar to the corresponding announcement
effects implied by the issuer-level analysis reported in Table 4. Furthermore, the estimated March 23
announcement effects based on bond-level data are fully robust to the inclusion of time fixed effects
(columns 4–6 in Panel A).
The April 9 announcement had, on balance, a somewhat smaller effect on credit spreads. Our
estimates of β indicate no discernible effect within the very narrow 1-day window bracketing the
April 9 announcement but point to relative declines of about seven and 13 basis points in the
5- and 10-day windows, respectively (columns 1–3 in Panel B). The size of these announcement
effects is very similar to those based on the issuer-level analysis, and the estimates of the April 9
announcement effects are essentially the same as those from the DiD specification that includes
time fixed effects (columns 4–6 in Panel B).
In Table 7, we report the results from the analogous bond-level analysis of bid-ask spreads.
This analysis indicates that the March 23 announcement improved liquidity in the corporate bond
market, lowering the bid-ask spreads on the SMCCF-eligible bonds 14 and 10 basis points within
the 5- and 10-day windows bracketing the announcement, respectively (columns 1–3 in Panel A);
as in the case of credit spreads, the inclusion of time fixed effects has no effect on the estimated
announcement effects. The April 9 announcement, in contrast, had no discernible effect on bid-ask
spreads in any event window. Again, all of these results are fully consistent with those based on
the issuer-level analysis reported in Table 5.
In sum, the DiD analysis presented above provides strong evidence that the Fed’s March 23 announcement of the corporate bond-buying program significantly eased strains in the U.S. corporate
bond market. In response to this announcement, credit spreads on the SMCCF-eligible bonds are
estimated to have narrowed about ten basis points, relative to their ineligible counterparts.

Note: The dependent variable in all specifications is BASi,j,t , the bid-ask spread of bond j (issued by firm i) on business day t (see the DiD specification 3
and the text for details). The entries in the table denote the OLS estimates of coefficients on the specified explanatory variable: 1[j ∈ SMCCF] =
0/1-indicator variable that equals one if bond j was eligible for purchase by the SMCCF as of March 22 and zero otherwise; and 1[t > t∗ ] = 0/1-indicator
variable that equals one if date t is greater than the specified announcement date t∗ and zero otherwise. In Panel A, t∗ = March 23, and in Panel B,
t∗ = April 9. All specifications include issuer fixed effects and the bond’s remaining maturity, age, coupon rate, and the logarithm of the par amount
issued as controls (not reported). Absolute t-statistics based on issuer-clustered standard errors are reported in brackets: * p < .10; ** p < .05; and
*** p < .01.

In addition to lowering credit spreads, the announcement also improved liquidity by reducing
relative bid-ask spreads between ten and 15 basis points, depending on the event window. The
follow-up April 9 announcement had a more muted effect. Credit spreads on the SMCCF-eligible
bonds are estimated to have narrowed by an additional seven to 13 basis points, depending on the
event window, while bid-ask spreads on those bonds did not react to the announcement.

5.3

Fallen Angels

The finding that the April 9 announcement had, on balance, less of an effect on the U.S. corporate
bond market is not that surprising. Unlike the “whatever it takes” message implied by the March 23
announcement, the April 9 announcement primarily clarified a number of key aspects of the Fed’s
corporate bond-buying program. It did, however, modify an important aspect of the program by
extending the facility to certain fallen angels, in effect signaling to the market the Fed’s willingness
to take on a potentially significant amount of credit on its balance sheet. In this section, we zero
in on this aspect of the April 9 announcement and examine its impact on the fallen angels’ credit
and bid-ask spreads.
To do so, we modify the issuer-level DiD specification (2) by an additional interaction level
using the 0/1-indicator variable 1[i = Fallen Angel], which equals one if issuer i is an eligible fallen
angel and zero otherwise.10 Specifically, we use our treatment and control groups to estimate

CStreated
− CScontrol
= β × 1[i = Fallen Angel] × 1[t > t∗ ] + γ × 1[t > t∗ ] + ηi + ǫi,t .
i,t
i,t

(4)

Because specification (4) includes issuer fixed effects, the indicator variable 1[i = Fallen Angel] is
not separately identified.
According to the entries in shown in Panel A of Table 8, the effects of the March 23 announcement on credit spreads of fallen angels are evident only in the 10-day window. This delayed effect
is not surprising because not all the rating downgrades occurred in the immediate aftermath of the
announcement. In the 10-day window, the estimate of β, the coefficient on the interaction term
1[i = Fallen Angel] × 1[t > t∗ ], is positive, economically large, and statistically significant. The
point estimate of 3.425 implies that credit spreads on the SMCCF-eligible bonds issued by fallen
angels increased about 340 basis points relative to their non-eligible counterparts in response to
the announcement.
This large estimated differential increase in credit spreads reflects the confluence of two factors.
First, the actual downgrade to junk status would, all else equal, lead to an increase in credit spreads
in both the treatment and control groups. The much larger estimated increase in credit spreads on
the fallen angels’ treated bonds is likely due to investors’ perception that the downgrade-induced
10

According to the SMCCF’s term sheet, an eligible fallen angel is a U.S. company that had an investment-grade
credit rating as of March 22 but was subsequently downgraded to junk. However, the fallen angel’s credit rating
still had to be at least BB-/Ba3 as of the date on which the SMCCF purchased their bonds. For the purpose of our
analysis, the downgrade had to occur after March 23 but before April 9. There are 18 companies in our sample that
meet this fallen angel criterion.

increase in default risk was heavily concentrated in the near term, leading to an inversion in the
term structure of credit risk for these companies. Second, following the downgrade, the fallen
angel’s SMCCF-eligible bonds were no longer eligible for purchase by the facility. Losing eligibility
for bonds in the treatment group could additionally drive up their credit spreads relative to their
counterparts in the control group. Both factors—the rising near-term credit risk and the loss of
eligibility status—may thus induce a differential effect between credit spreads in the treatment and
control groups.
The estimated effects of the April 9 announcement reported in Panel B, by contrast, are as
expected. In the 5-day window bracketing the announcement, credit spreads on the fallen angels’
SMCCF-eligible bonds are estimated to have narrowed about 120 basis points relative to their
ineligible counterparts, while in the 10-day window, the estimated announcement effect rises to
220 basis points. All told, the Fed’s April 9 announcement is estimated to have reversed about

two-thirds of the relative increase in credit spreads for fallen angels that occurred in the aftermath
of the March 23 announcement.
Table 9 contains the corresponding announcement effects for bid-ask spreads. Consistent with
the credit spread results discussed above, the March 23 announcement is estimated to have boosted
bid-ask spreads on the fallen angels’ SMCCF-eligible bonds almost 200 basis points—relative to
their ineligible counterparts—within the 10-day window bracketing the announcement. This significant deterioration in liquidity, however, was nearly fully reversed by the April 9 announcement,
which is estimated to have lowered the fallen angels’ SMCCF-eligible bonds about 175 basis points
relative to their ineligible counterparts within the same-length window. Indeed, the Fed’s April 9
announcement significantly improved liquidity of the SMCCF-eligible bonds issued by fallen angels,
inducing declines ranging from 175 to almost 360 basis points depending on the event window.

The SMCCF’s Purchase Effects

Our analysis thus far has focused on the impact of the two corporate bond-buying program announcements on credit and bid-ask spreads. As noted above, the Fed started to purchase individual
corporate bonds on June 16, 2020. Figure 5 shows the dollar amount of corporate bonds purchased
by the facility between June 16 and the end of July of this year. In the latter half of June, the
SMCCF purchased about 150 million dollars of corporate bonds during an average day. The average pace of purchases tapered off to about $100 million per day during the first half of July and to
only $20 million by the end of July.
Table 10 provides the selected summary statistics of corporate bonds purchased by the facility
during this six-week period, based on the information available as of August 10. According to the
entries in the table, the SMCCF purchased 1,351 individual corporate bonds, issued by 482 unique
companies. A total of 919 unique bonds were purchased between June 16 and July 30, with the
total par value of almost $3.4 billion. The average time-to-maturity across all purchased bonds was
about three years, and the average bond in the SMCCF’s portfolio was issued nearly four years ago.
In terms of their payout characteristics, a vast majority of purchased bonds had a fixed coupon
schedule, and the average coupon rate across all purchased bonds was 3.4 percent.
We now examine whether these purchases had an effect on credit and bid-ask spreads in the corporate bond market. We estimate the actual purchase effects using the bond-level DiD framework
(see specification 3), where we modify the announcement date t∗ . Specifically, in this exercise,
t∗ equals June 15, a day before the facility commenced with the actual purchases of individual
corporate bonds, or June 28 when the Fed revealed the composition of its purchases to the broader

Bank of New York.

public. As before, we consider 1-, 5-, and 10-day symmetric windows bracketing the two dates. In
this context, it is important to remember that although it was public knowledge that the facility will
begin buying individual corporate bonds on June 16, the Fed revealed details of its purchases only
on Monday June 28; in other words, from June 16 through June 26, the Fed conducted “stealth”
purchases, in the sense that market participants were unaware which corporate bonds were being
purchased by the facility.
Table 11 contains the results of this exercise for credit spreads, while Table 12 shows the corresponding results for the bid-ask spreads. In both tables, Panel A reports the estimated purchase
effects induced by the actual purchases that started on June 16, while Panel B reports the effects
following the release of the detailed information on purchases-to-date to the broader public on
June 28.
As shown in Panel A of Table 11, the Fed’s “stealth” purchases of corporate bonds had no
material effect on credit spreads of the bonds purchased. The estimates of the coefficient β on the
interaction term 1[j ∈ SMCCF] × 1[t > June 15], while positive, are economically trivial (between
one and two basis points) and barely significant at conventional levels. The corresponding estimates
of β in Panel B, while at least negative, are also negligible in economic terms and significant at the
5 percent level only in the 10-day window. The results using bid-ask spreads detailed in Table 11
paint the same picture—the Fed’s actual purchases of corporate bonds or its announcement of what
it had purchased had no effect on the bid-ask spreads in the corporate bond market. Overall, these
results would suggest that virtually the entire impact of the Fed’s corporate bond-buying program
on credit and bid-ask spreads can be attributed to the March 23 and April 9 announcements, rather
than to the actual purchases of corporate bonds.
While certainly not implausible, this interpretation relies on evidence from event windows of
1-, 5-, and 10-days bracketing June 15 and June 28. It is entirely possible that the Fed’s purchases
did have an effect on prices of the SMCCF-eligible bonds, but the effect was very transient. To
test this hypothesis, we utilize the intra-day transactions data in our TRACE data set to identify

Note: The dependent variable in all specifications is CSi,j,t , the credit spread of bond j (issued by firm i) on business day t (see the DiD specification 3
and the text for details). The entries in the table denote the OLS estimates of coefficients on the specified explanatory variable: 1[j ∈ SMCCF] =
0/1-indicator variable that equals one if bond j was eligible for purchase by the SMCCF as of March 22 and zero otherwise; and 1[t > t∗ ] = 0/1-indicator
variable that equals one if date t is greater than the specified date t∗ and zero otherwise. In Panel A, t∗ = June 16, and in Panel B, t∗ = June 28. All
specifications include issuer fixed effects and the bond’s remaining maturity, age, coupon rate, and the logarithm of the par amount issued as controls
(not reported). Absolute t-statistics based on issuer-clustered standard errors are reported in brackets: * p < .10; ** p < .05; and *** p < .01.

the Fed’s purchases of individual bonds. By matching the bond’s CUSIP, purchase date and time,
transaction price and quantity in dealer-to-customer transactions, we are able to uniquely identify
almost all of the Fed’s purchases.11 Using the exact time of each purchase, we perform a simple
intra-day event study, whose major advantage is that we are able to identify much more short-lived
purchase effects.
The blue line in the left panel of Figure 6 shows the average spread on bonds actually purchased by the SMCCF within the event window that spans 20 hours before and 20 hours after the
purchase time, which is normalized to be equal to zero. According to this figure, the credit spread
on an average purchased bond declined about five basis points upon the actual purchase. Over
the subsequent six hours, the spread edged up about two basis points before stabilizing over the
remainder of the event window for a net decline of about three basis points. The red line shows the
corresponding average spread in the control group—that is, bonds issued by the same set of issuers
but whose remaining maturity is greater than five years.12 Interestingly, the actual purchases ap11
Specifically, we uniquely identify all of the facility’s 1,351 purchases, except for a single purchase on June 29;
this transaction involved the bond with CUSIP 126650CT5, issued by the CVS Health Corporation, which had two
matches at slightly different times: 11:33:39 a.m. and 11:59:12 a.m. We drop this transaction from our analysis.

As before, we construct the control group by pairing each bond purchased by the SMCCF—the treatment group—
with a bond issued by the same issuer but whose time-to-maturity is greater than five years. There are 482 unique
issuers in our treatment group. If an issuer has multiple bonds purchased by the SMCCF, we choose the bond with

is very small, a mere basis point or so.
The right panel of Figure 6 shows the same event study for bid-ask spreads. Though considerably
more noisy, the average bid-ask spread on bonds actually purchased by the SMCCF, the blue line,
is estimated to have declined about five basis points upon purchase before bouncing back over the
subsequent several hours. The average bid-ask spread on bonds in our control group, by contrast,
shows no discernible pattern around the purchase time.

Conclusion

In this paper, we identify the effects of the SMCCF on the U.S. corporate bond market using a
variety of identification strategies. We find that the Fed’s March 23 and April 9 announcements
both had economically large and statistically significant effects on credit spreads, in combination
narrowing spreads by 20 basis points on eligible bonds relative to their ineligible counterparts within
the same set of issuers across the two announcement periods. The March 23 announcement also
significantly improved market liquidity by lowering bid-ask spreads. The April 9 announcement,
by narrowing both credit and bid-ask spreads, had an especially pronounced effect on the SMCCFeligible bonds issued by the qualified fallen angels.
The actual bond purchases conducted by the Fed from mid-June through the end of July are
estimated to have narrowed credit spreads by an additional five basis points and bid-ask spreads by
two basis points. These findings are intuitive in the sense that the announcements were interpreted
by market participants as a credible signal of the Fed’s willingness to take a material amount of
credit risk on its balance sheet to support the corporate credit markets. Overall, we find strong
evidence for both announcement and purchase effects of the SMCCF, and our quantitative assessment of those effects indicates that the facility made it substantially easier for companies to borrow
in the corporate bond market.
