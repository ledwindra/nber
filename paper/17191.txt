ABSTRACT
Firms spend substantial resources on marketing and selling. Interpreting this as evidence of frictions
in product markets, which require firms to spend resources on customer acquisition, this paper develops
a search theoretic model of firm dynamics in frictional product markets. Introducing search frictions
generates long-term customer relationships, rendering the customer base a state variable for firms,
which is sluggish to adjust. This affects: the level and volatility of firm investment, sales, profits, value
and markups, the timing of firm responses to shocks, and the relationship between investment and
Tobin’s q. We document support for these predictions in firm-level data from Compustat, using cross-industry
variation in selling expenses to quantify differences in the degree of friction across markets.

Introduction

Firms spend substantial resources on marketing and selling, with marketing expenditures
recently estimated to make up as much as five percent of GDP (see Arkolakis Forthcoming).
Interpreting this as evidence of frictions in product markets, which require firms to spend
resources on customer acquisition, this paper develops a search theoretic model of firm
dynamics in frictional product markets. Introducing search frictions generates long-term
customer relationships, rendering the customer base a state variable for firms, which is
sluggish to adjust. We use this framework to study the implications of frictional product
markets and customer base concerns for firm dynamics: the level and volatility of firm
investment, sales, profits, value and markups, the timing of firm responses to shocks, as well
as the relationship between investment and Tobin’s q. Moreover, we document support for
these predictions in firm-level data from Compustat, using cross-industry variation in selling
expenses to quantify differences in the degree of product market friction across markets.
Our paper contributes to a newly developing literature – both theoretical and empirical –
emphasizing the role of customer base concerns in a variety of settings,1 by studying the
direct implications for firm dynamics.
To understand the implications of product market frictions for firms, we begin by developing a tractable search-theoretic general equilibrium model of frictional product markets.
The model builds on the Mortensen-Pissarides matching model, and nests the neoclassical
adjustment cost model of investment. In the model, a continuum of firms produce goods
which are sold through a product market affected by informational frictions concerning product characteristics. To overcome these frictions, firms must hire sales people to meet with
potential customers, and consumers spend time searching for suppliers. Search frictions render customer relationships long-term in nature, and the customer base thus a state variable
for firm decision-making. To allow firms to influence customer acquisition through pricing,
we incorporate directed/competitive search into the model, with firms using optimal pricing
schedules to attract new customers. Equilibrium pricing schedules involve an initial discount
to new customers, with firms charging existing customers a price which leaves them indif1

We discuss these papers in Section 5.

ferent between continuing the customer relationship or not.2 Three features of the model
are important for the results we emphasize: long-term customer relationships, customers
purchasing a fixed quantity per period, and convex costs of customer acquisition.
Product market frictions have a number of implications for firms, which we find nontrivial in magnitude:
First, they generate a form of intangible capital embodied in the customer base. When
customer relationships are long-term in nature and the costs of customer acquisition paid
up-front, the present value of firm profits from a new customer relationship must make up
for the initial costs of attracting the customer. This turns existing customers into valuable
assets for firms. Frictional product markets thus raise firm value above the value of physical
capital, profit rates above the cost of capital, as well as generating positive markups.3
Second, product market frictions affect firm dynamics. On the one hand, by effectively imposing an additional adjustment cost on firm expansion, they work to dampen firm responses
to shocks. On the other, by slowing down expansion in sales, they generate hump-shaped
responses in a number of variables. In the neoclassical adjustment cost model, an increase
in firm productivity leads to an instantaneous increase in firm sales and investment. In a
frictional product market, however, the increase in production capacity leaves the firm short
of customers to sell to, as the convex costs of customer base expansion slow down the increase
in sales in the short run. Investment rises on impact, but continues to rise further as the firm
accumulates customers (and eventually finds itself short of production capacity), generating
a hump-shaped response. These changes in firm dynamics make frictional product markets
promising for understanding the evidence on hump-shaped responses of macro-aggregates –
2

Examples of products motivating our model are newspapers subscriptions and cell phone services. Newspapers offer discounts to new customers, subsequently charging a price above the marginal cost of production
for an extended period of time. Similarly, cell phone providers often offer an initial discount in the form of
a free phone. In these industries it appears common to evaluate the value of a firm based on the number of
customers, the customer retention rate, and the margin per customer. We believe the main insights of our
analysis to apply also to markets where contracts are implicit, however.
3
The paper is thus related to the literature emphasizing the importance of intangible capital, such as Hall
(2001b), Atkeson and Kehoe (2005), McGrattan and Prescott (2010a, 2010b), Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou
(2009), Ai, Croce, and Li (2010). Relative to this literature, which generally considers a broader notion of
organizational capital, we model and study a particular form of intangible capital more closely. An exception
within the finance literature is Belo, Lin, and Vitorino (2011), who study the relationship between brand
capital and firm riskiness.

in particular investment – to aggregate shocks.4 The complementarity of customer capital
with physical capital plays a key role in generating hump-shaped responses in investment.
Third, product market frictions affect the widely-studied relationship between investment
and Tobin’s q. A large literature documents that the simple prediction of the neoclassical
adjustment cost model – that Tobin’s q be a sufficient statistic for firm investment – has
little success empirically.5 Frictional product markets offer a potential explanation for this
evidence by breaking the perfect correlation between investment and Tobin’s q implied by the
neoclassical model. Plausibly parameterized, these frictions reduce the coefficient estimate
in an investment-q regression by a factor of four. Moreover, as found in the data, the
model predicts firm profits to have stronger explanatory power for investment than Tobin’s
q: Profits share the hump-shaped response of investment to shocks, while Tobin’s q does not.
To establish the empirical relevance of the model mechanism across a range of markets,
we turn to firm-level data from Compustat. Because product market frictions are likely to
be more important in some markets than others, it is natural to use this cross-sectional
variation to test the predictions of the model. The model associates greater frictions with
greater overall selling expenses within a market. Sorting markets according to selling expenses thus allows us to compare markets characterized by differing degrees of friction. We
document support for each of the main predictions discussed: the levels and volatility of firm
investment, sales, profits, value and markups, the timing of firm responses to shocks, and the
relationship between investment and Tobin’s q – both at the firm, industry, and aggregate
level.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model. Section 3 fleshes out
the implications of the model, which we study empirically in Section 4. Section 5 relates
our paper to recent work emphasizing the role of the customer base in various contexts, and
4

See e.g. Cogley and Nason (1995), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), Basu, Fernald, and
Kimball (2006), Smets and Wouters (2007). Such hump-shapes are generally at odds with the neoclassical
growth model, where variables respond to shocks on impact, and recent literature resorts to non-standard
adjustment cost functions to replicate these patterns within a model (e.g. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans 2005, Jaimovich and Rebelo 2009).
5
Caballero (1999) and Chirinko (1993) survey this literature. A number of alternative explanations have
been proposed for the empirical failure of q-theory (as discussed in Sections 3 and 4). Although all of
these alternatives imply that q-theory not hold exactly, in many models it nevertheless works well as an
approximation (see e.g. Gomes 2001).

The Model

This section introduces a model designed for analyzing the effects of frictional product markets on firm investment, sales, profits, value and their dynamic responses to shocks. The
model economy is populated by a representative household and a cross-section of firms facing
idiosyncratic shocks to their productivity. We begin by examining a stationary competitive
equilibrium, together with a corresponding planning problem, but the analysis is straightforward to extend to allow aggregate shocks as well.6 We return to discuss our modeling
choices at the end of the section.

Firms Production is carried out by a continuum of measure one firms, each producing a
differentiated good with a Cobb-Douglas production technology y = f (k, lp , z). Firms sell
the goods through a frictional market to the household, which converts them one-for-one
into a homogenous good used for consumption and investment. The homogenous good acts
as both the medium of exchange and the numeraire in the economy.7 Firms accumulate
capital according to the law of motion k ′ = (1 − δk )k + i, with existing capital depreciating
at rate δk . New investment entails a cost φ(i, k), which includes both the purchase price
of capital and a standard convex adjustment cost. Firms hire production labor lp from a
frictionless labor market. Finally, productivity z is independent across firms, and follows
a Markovian stochastic process with a bounded support and a continuous and monotone
transition function.
6

Appendix C describes the version of the model where we replace the idiosyncratic shocks with aggregate
shocks.
7
To fix ideas, one can think of each firm as producing the same good in different colors. Due to idiosyncratic differences in tastes, not all buyers will accept all colors. Once a buyer has accepted to buy a good,
however, for all practical purposes the color becomes irrelevant. Assuming that the goods become perfectly
substitutable ex-post allows capturing the frictions in creating purchasing relationships, while keeping the
model as simple as possible.

Representative household The representative household consumes the homogenous good
and leisure, with preferences

β t u(ct , 1 − ltm − ltb ).

(1)

t=0

Here u is strictly increasing and concave, and satisfies Inada conditions. The household
allocates its time between leisure, market work ltm , and buying activity ltb . The household’s
per-period budget constraint (with the price of the homogenous good normalized to one)
reads
ct ≤ wt ltm + wtbltb + Πt ,

(2)

for all t ≥ 0.8 The household’s income, on the right, consists of the wages on market work
wt ltm and the aggregated dividends Πt . In addition, buying activity also yields a positive
payoff wtbltb , discussed in detail below. Note that the budget constraint is formulated in
terms of a frictionless market in the homogenous good. The supply of the good to this
market is determined by the frictional product market, discussed next.

Frictional product market The measure lb infinitesimal household members engaged
in buying activity are each aware of all firms producing goods, but due to idiosyncratic
differences in tastes, they are not each willing to buy all firms’ goods. Informational frictions
imply that in order for a household member to determine whether he or she is willing to
buy a particular firm’s good, the household member must meet with the firm’s sales person.
To allow these meetings to take place, firms hire sales people. The sales people are placed
in separate sales locations differing in centrality, starting from the most central toward the
less central. Formally, this idea is captured by assuming that the measure of sales people
generating ls efficiency units of sales people is given by an increasing and convex function
κ(ls ).9
We assume household members decide on the sales locations to visit independently, and
8

We could include a saving/portfolio-choice decision, allowing the household to choose how much to invest
in each firm. It would not change allocations, however, as in equilibrium the household owns all the firms.
Doing so would make explicit the usual observation that the rate of return on the household portfolio must
equal 1/β − 1 in a stationary equilibrium.
9
The assumption that κ is convex is important for the firm dynamics we emphasize later. We discuss
this, and other, modeling choices at the end of the section.

that sales people have finite capacity to handle potential buyers. Meetings between sales
people and potential buyers are thus subject to coordination frictions: Each period some
sales locations go without any potential buyers arriving, while others get more than the
sales person can handle. We capture this formally with a firm-level matching function. If
a firm hires ls efficiency units of sales people, with lb potential buyers arriving across sales
locations, then the measure of new customer relationships is given by m(lb , ls ) = ξ(lb )γ (ls )1−γ ,
where ξ > 0 and γ ∈ (0, 1). This measure is a product of the exogenous probability of a
meeting leading to a new customer relationship, and the measure of meetings taking place.
We use θ = lb /ls to denote the (firm-specific) average queue-length of potential buyers across
a firm’s sales people.10 With this, the probability of matching per sales person, η(θ) = ξθγ ,
becomes an increasing function of the queue length. Similarly, the probability of matching
per potential buyer, µ(θ) = ξθγ−1 , becomes a decreasing function of the queue length. These
expressions capture the idea that an increase in potential buyers per sales person increases
matches per sales person, but at a diminishing rate because these buyers are more likely to
arrive in locations with sales people occupied.11
For thinking about the payoff to buying activity, it is useful to start from existing customer relationships, where one unit of the differentiated good changes hands per period.
Existing relationships end with probability δn each period, for idiosyncratic reasons. Apart
from this exogenous customer depreciation, a customer relationship continues as long as the
customer is willing to continue to buy a unit of the good per period, and the firm to produce
it. Because the customer values the differentiated good at one unit of the homogenous good
(and there is no additional cost of continuing the relationship), that is how much he or she is
willing to pay for it. To maximize profits, the firm charges the highest price it can without
driving the customer away. In principle these payments could be scheduled in different ways
To be exact, ls , lb are in units of selling and buying time, so θ captures average buying time per unit of
selling time.
11
This discussion is based on Stevens (2007), who describes a matching process that generates an approximately Cobb-Douglas matching function: Sales people are situated in separate sales locations and handle
potential buyers at a finite Poisson rate. Potential buyers contact these sales people at a finite Poisson rate,
but cannot coordinate among themselves on which sales people to contact. This means that upon contacting
a sales person, a potential buyer may find them occupied with another buyer. Increasing the number of
potential buyers per sales person increases the number of matches per sales person (as sales people spend
less time idle), but at a diminishing rate (as idle time is limited).

over time, but because we assume firms cannot commit to future prices, it follows that they
optimally price at exactly one unit of the homogenous good per period.12
To allow firms influence over customer acquisition through their pricing decisions, we
assume firms can commit to an initial discount to new customers. Firms use these discounts
to compete for new customers as follows: Each period each household member engaged in
buying activity optimally chooses a firm based on the discounts ε and queue lengths θ across
firms. The payoff w b must be consistent with this optimization, implying that
w b = max µ(θ)ε.
{(ε,θ)}

(3)

Choosing a firm with discount ε and queue length θ leads to a new customer relationship
forming with probability µ(θ). The present value of the relationship to the household member
is ε: the customer gets one unit of the homogenous good per period,13 and pays back 1 − ε
units in the first period, and one unit in later periods.
Note that equation (3) implies that potential buyers can be indifferent between low
discount firms and high discount firms, if the queues in the low discount firms are sufficiently
shorter than in the high discount firms. In equilibrium different firms indeed generally
offer different discounts, depending on their desire to expand sales (with potential buyers
indifferent across firms).
12
We assume the firm can refuse attempts by customers to re-bargain prices, as doing so would not be in
the firm’s interests.
13
The customer receives one unit of the differentiated good per period, but converts it one-for-one into
the homogenous good.

7

Firm problem With this, we can write the firm problem in a stationary equilibrium,
where w and w b are constant, as
v(k, n, z|w, w b) =

max y − ls η(θ)ε − wlp − wκ(ls ) − φ(i, k) + βEz v(k ′ , n′ , z ′ |w, w b), (F)

y,i,lp ,ls ,θ,ε

y ≤ n + ls η(θ),

(4)

y ≤ f (k, lp , z),

(5)

n′ ≤ (1 − δn )y,

(6)

k ′ ≤ (1 − δk )k + i,

(7)

w b ≤ µ(θ)ε,

(8)

where all choice variables except investment are non-negative. In addition to capital and
productivity, the state variables of the firm now include the size of the customer base. We
use n to denote the measure of existing customers at the beginning of the period. Hiring
κ(ls ) units of labor to work in sales (with ls efficiency units resulting), the firm attracts
ls η(θ) new customers this period. Here the queue length θ depends on the choice of discount
ε, as explained below. Equations (4) and (5) state that total units sold y cannot exceed the
size of the customer base, nor production output, respectively. In fact, because producing
excess output cannot be optimal, (5) must hold with equality, determining how much labor
ℓp (k, y, z) is needed to produce y units of output. Equation (6) is the law of motion for the
customer base, which limits next period’s customer base to the fraction of current customers
who remain with the firm. Equation (7) is the law of motion for capital. Finally, as standard
in competitive search, equation (8) imposes rational expectations regarding the queue length
attracted by the firm’s choice of discount ε. The firm takes as given the market-determined
payoff to buying activity w b , and expects a queue which leaves customers indifferent between
choosing this firm versus attaining the market payoff somewhere else.
The firm’s objective is to maximize the present discounted value of dividends. Current
dividends are given by sales revenue y net of discounts to new customers ls η(θ)ε, wages of
production and sales labor, as well as the costs of investment – all in terms of the homogenous

8

good.14 Finally, the present value of future dividends is given by βEz v(k ′ , n′ , z ′ |w, w b).
Notice that despite constant returns to scale in production, the convex costs of capital
adjustment (as usual) imply that firms face decreasing returns in the short run. As a result,
production will not be taken over by whichever firm has the highest productivity realization
in the current period. Here the convex costs of customer acquisition only serve to reinforce
this. In practice, we will assume that the customer depreciation rate δn is large enough to
guarantee that the firm hires some sales people each period, even when a low productivity
realization causes it to contract overall. This affords us the following first order conditions
for characterizing decision-making.
The firm problem implies that the marginal value of an additional customer is forwardlooking, satisfying the envelope condition
vn (k, n, z|w, w b) = 1 − wℓpy (k, y, z) + β(1 − δn )Ez vn (k ′ , n′ , z ′ |w, w b).

(9)

An additional customer increases today’s sales revenue by one unit, and production costs by
wℓpy (k, y, z). Moreover, with probability 1 − δn the customer stays with the firm also into the
following period, delivering the continuation value βEz vn (k ′ , n′ , z ′ |w, w b).
The firm hires sales people until the marginal cost of an additional customer equals the
marginal value, as reflected in the first order condition for ls :
w

κ′ (ls )
+ ε = vn (k, n, z|w, w b).
η(θ)

(10)

The marginal cost of an additional customer, on the left, consists of both the wages of
additional sales people, as well as the discounts used to attract new customers. These
up-front costs of customer acquisition generally imply that existing customers are valuable
assets the firm (i.e. vn (k, n, z|w, w b) > 0). Because the value of a customer depends on the
firm’s state – both its production capacity (determined by capital and productivity) and its
existing customer base – so does the measure of sales people the firm hires.
14
Note that investment takes the form of the homogenous good, rather than the differentiated good, and
therefore must also be procured through the frictional market. Firms purchase investment goods from the
same frictionless market in consumption goods described in the household problem.

9

The firm chooses the discount to minimize the costs of customer acquisition, resolving
a trade-off between the two costs involved. Increasing the discount attracts more potential
buyers per sales person, increasing customer acquisition per sales person, but at the same
time it also reduces the profitability of those customers. The firm raises the discount to a
point where the percentage increase in new customer relationships just compensates for the
percentage drop in profitability per customer, as reflected in the first order condition for ε:
γ 1
1
=
.
b
vn (k, n, z|w, w ) − ε
1−γε

(11)

Here vn (k, n, z|w, w b) − ε is the value of the marginal relationship to the firm and ε that to
the customer. A marginal increase in the discount increases the value to the customer by
1/ε (in percentage terms), leading to a percentage increase in new customer relationships
of γ/(1 − γ) × 1/ε. The matching function elasticity γ governs the extent to which it is
profitable to offer low prices to attract more customers. A low value of γ implies that sales
people cannot handle more customers per unit of time, so competition does not lead to large
discounts.
Combining equations (8), (10), and (11) yields the following result, which implies that
in equilibrium firms hiring more sales people also offer bigger discounts and attract longer
queues:
PROPOSITION 1. A firm’s queue length and discount are increasing in its sales personnel
ls : θ = γ/(1 − γ) × κ′ (ls ) and ε = wθ1−γ /ξ.

Investment The firm invests according to the familiar rule, implied by the first order
condition for i,
φi (i, k) = βEz vk (k ′ , n′ , z ′ |w, w b),

(12)

which equates the marginal cost of investment to the discounted value of additional capital
next period, also known as marginal q. Together with a standard quadratic adjustment cost
for investment, this equation implies a linear relationship between the investment rate i/k
and marginal q. If the product market is frictionless, marginal q then equals Tobin’s q (i.e.
10

v(k ′ , n′ , z ′ |w, w b)/k ′ ), which implies a linear relationship between the investment rate and
Tobin’s q.15 Product market frictions break the linear relationship by introducing a timevarying wedge between marginal q and Tobin’s q, offering a potential explanation for the
weak correlation between these variables in the data. We discuss these changes in dynamics,
and their implications for investment-q regressions, in Section 3.

Aggregation Before defining an equilibrium, we need to define a number of aggregate
variables. To simplify notation, we denote a firm’s state as x = (k, n, z). The cross-sectional
distribution of firms across capital, customers and productivity can then be denoted by
λ(x). The distribution evolves over time according to a law of motion λ′ = T (λ|w, w b),
determined by the productivity process and firm decision rules, but we focus on a stationary distribution where λ′ = λ. Integrating over the stationary distribution yields
R
aggregate output Y (λ|w, w b) = y(x|w, w b)dλ(x), and costs of investment Φ(λ|w, w b) =
R
φ(i(x|w, w b), k)dλ(x). The aggregate demand for labor, used in production and sales, is
R
Ld (λ|w, w b) = ℓp (k, y(x|w, w b), z) + κ(ls (x|w, w b))dλ(x). Finally, aggregate dividends are
R
Π(λ|w, w b) = π(x|w, w b)dλ(x), where π denotes the firm-level dividend.
DEFINITION 1. A stationary competitive search equilibrium16 specifies: i) household
decision rules C(w, w b, Π), Lm (w, w b, Π), Lb (w, w b, Π), ii) firm decision rules y(x|w, w b),
i(x|w, w b), lp (x|w, w b), ls (x|w, w b), θ(x|w, w b), ε(x|w, w b), and value function v(x|w, w b), iii)
aggregates Y (λ|w, w b), Φ(λ|w, w b), Ld (λ|w, w b), Π(λ|w, w b), iv) wage w, v) payoff to buying
w b , and vi) distribution of firms λ, such that
1. The firm decision rules and value function solve the firm problem (F).
2. The household decision rules maximize (1) subject to (2), and optimal buying behavior
solves problem (3).
3. The goods market clears: C(w, w b, Π(λ|w, w b)) + Φ(λ|w, w b) = Y (λ|w, w b).
4. The labor market clears: Lm (w, w b, Π(λ|w, w b)) = Ld (λ|w, w b).
15

Hayashi (1982) shows that with constant returns to scale, marginal and average q are the same.
We incorporate the competitive search equilibrium of Moen (1997) and Shimer (1996) into a stationary
equilibrium with a cross-section of firms (e.g. Gomes 2001).

ls (x|w, w b)θ(x|w, w b)dλ(x).

6. Stationarity: The distribution of firms λ is stationary.

Planning problem To understand the allocations in the competitive equilibrium more
concretely, it is useful to spell out a corresponding planning problem, subject to the same
frictions:
V (λ) = max u(c, l) + βEz V (λ′ )
Z
Z
c + φ(i(x), k)dλ(x) ≤ y(x)dλ(x),
Z
l + [lp (x) + lb (x) + κ(ls (x))]dλ(x) ≤ 1,

(P)
(13)
(14)

y(x) ≤ f (k, lp (x), z), ∀x,

(15)

y(x) ≤ n + m(lb (x), ls (x)), ∀x,

(16)

n′ (x) ≤ (1 − δn )y(x), ∀x,

(17)

k ′ (x) ≤ (1 − δk )k + i(x), ∀x.

(18)

Here the choice variables are c, l and functions y(x), i(x), lb (x), lp (x), ls (x), n′ (x), k ′ (x), for all
x ∈ supp(λ). All choice variables except investment are assumed non-negative. The planner
maximizes the utility of the representative household, allocating goods between consumption
and investment (across production units), and time between leisure, production, selling and
buying (across production units). The planner faces the same frictions in bringing together
customers and producers, requiring keeping track of the customer bases of production units.
The planner allocates investment, as well as selling and buying time, for each production unit
separately, depending on their productivity, capital stock and customer base. Equation (13)
states that the sum of consumption and investment (across production units) cannot exceed
total output across production units. Equation (14) states that the sum of time allocated to
leisure, production, selling and buying cannot exceed the total time endowment. Equations
(15) and (16) state that the output of a production unit cannot exceed what the production
technology, nor the customer base, of the producer allow. Equations (17) and (18) are laws

12

of motion for the customer base and capital stock.
The planning problem is concave, with first order conditions that coincide with those of
the competitive equilibrium.17 Useful for familiar reasons, this implies that not only is a
competitive equilibrium constrained efficient, but that we can use the planning problem to
understand equilibrium outcomes. For a more detailed analysis of the connection between
the two problems we refer the reader to Kaas and Kircher (2011), who analyze a related
environment with frictional labor (rather than product) markets.

Discussion of modeling approach Before proceeding to study the model implications,
we briefly discuss four key elements of our modeling approach. First, the buyers in our model
spend time searching for products because of differences in tastes over product characteristics.
An alternative approach would be to assume identical tastes, with buyers searching for low
prices instead. Although we view both frictions as relevant, it is substantially simpler to begin
with the former. Equilibrium models of price dispersion, such as Burdett and Judd (1983)
or Burdett and Mortensen (1998), typically focus on stationary environments abstracting
from dynamics in production costs. Because we specifically seek to analyze the effects of
product market frictions and long-term customer relationships on firm dynamics, a natural
framework to turn to instead is the Mortensen-Pissarides model.18 While this framework
lends itself well to thinking about search for the right products, determining prices through
bargaining seems less natural in the context of product (than labor) markets. For this reason,
we introduce directed search into the model, allowing firms to optimally choose prices based
on trading off attracting more (new) customers against greater profits per (new) customer.
Second, as recent work using the Mortensen-Pissarides model to analyze firm dynamics
in frictional labor markets (Kaas and Kircher 2011, Garibaldi and Moen 2010), we too have
adopted a convex cost function (κ) to curb firm responses to idiosyncratic shocks. This
convexity is important for the dynamics we emphasize in Section 3, rendering the customer
base a bottleneck for firm expansion. The other central element capturing frictions in the
model – the matching function – turns both selling and buying time into necessary inputs

for producing matches, but does not limit reallocation in response to firm-level shocks. The
matching function elasticity governs the shares of these two inputs in the production of
matches, as well as the extent to which it is profitable to offer low prices to attract more
customers. A low value of γ implies that: i) sales people cannot handle more customers
per unit of time, so competition does not lead to large discounts, but also that ii) total
equilibrium buying time is low.19
Third, in the Mortensen-Pissarides model, the path of prices within a match is generally
not allocative (beyond its present value). Similarly, although our assumptions determine a
path of prices within each customer relationship, the close connection between the planner’s
allocation and the market equilibrium underlines the fact that this particular path is not
essential for allocations. With this feature of the modeling framework in mind, we have
sought to (whenever possible) emphasize the implications for allocations rather than prices.
Note that the way the path of prices is determined in the model – effectively implementing
two-part pricing – has the advantage of avoiding additional state variables for keeping track
of different price-schedules for different cohorts of customers: All existing customers pay the
same price (which is identical across firms), while new customers get an initial discount,
which depends on the firm’s desire to expand (which varies across firms).
Finally, we explicitly focus on the extensive margin of firm demand, abstracting from the
intensive margin of demand per-customer – the polar opposite of the standard case in the
literature. Abstracting from the intensive margin has the advantage of simplifying the model
substantially, allowing us to highlight the role of the extensive margin for firm dynamics.20

Implications of Customer Capital

How do product market frictions affect firm investment, sales, profits, value and their dynamic responses to shocks? This section demonstrates the effects, focusing on the idiosyncratic shocks which dominate at the firm-level first, and turning to aggregate shocks at the

Parametrization To illustrate the impact of frictions, as well as to get a rough idea
of magnitudes, we parameterize and solve the model numerically. Appendix B discusses
our numerical approach in more detail. Parameterizing is straightforward for a number of
the parameters, which are standard in the literature, but requires more thought for the
parameters governing the frictional product market.
We begin with a conventional parametrization of the neoclassical adjustment cost model.21
The annual discount rate is set to β = 0.95. We set the capital depreciation rate to δk = 0.1,
and the capital share in production to α = 0.3. The capital adjustment cost is quadratic,
φ(i, k) = i+ϕk /2×(i/k−δk )2 k, with ϕk = 10. This adjustment cost parameter represents the
middle ground of a wide range of estimates: for example Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995)
estimate a value around 6, while Erickson and Whited (2000) a value around 20.22 We adopt
the preferences u(c, l) = log c + A log l, where A is set such that market work comes to a
third of total time (Hansen 1985).23 Finally, the AR(1) process for productivity z follows the
estimates of Hennessy and Whited (2005), with an AR(1) coefficient of 0.74 and a standard
deviation of the shock of 0.123.
The remaining parameters pertain to the frictional product market: the customer depreciation rate δn , the matching function parameters ξ and γ, along with the function κ(ls ). We
use available evidence to set values for these parameters, returning to examine sensitivity
later.
The customer depreciation rate δn is an important parameter for the impact frictional
markets have. Although firms in some industries regularly announce customer turnover
rates, and such rates play an important role in the marketing literature on customer equity,
systematic evidence on the topic appears scant. Some examples include the following:24 Cell
phone service providers are recently reporting monthly turnover rates of 1 − 2.5 percent,
21

The model is solved on a monthly frequency, but we report annual values here.
By contrast, the direct investment-q regression evidence suggests a parameter around 30.
23
The form of preferences is irrelevant for responses to firm-level shocks, but plays an important role for
responses to aggregate shocks.

translating into annual rates of 11 − 26 percent. In online banking, the corresponding annual
rates are in the 10 − 20 percent range. Both are examples of products with contractual longterm customer relationships, which makes the customer turnover rate a natural statistic
for firms to follow. For an example in a non-contractual setting, survey evidence on the
frequency at which consumers switch their primary super market suggests annual customer
turnover rates of 10 − 25 percent. Acknowledging that there exists significant heterogeneity
on this dimension, we adopt an annual customer depreciation rate of δn = 0.15.
Next, the parameters γ and ξ of the matching function m(lb , ls ) = ξ(lb )γ (ls )1−γ are
determined based on evidence on total time spent in buying and selling activities at the
R
aggregate level, corresponding to Lb and κ(ls )dλ in the model. Our targets for these two
values are 0.53 and 2.13 percent of total time, respectively. (Note that these values are very

small compared to the one third of total time we attribute to market work, as standard in
the literature.) To arrive at these targets we use data on the share of the labor force in
sales-related occupations from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, and
the amount of time consumers spend shopping from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS).
According to the OES survey, 11 percent of US workers are employed in sales-related occupations.25 Examples of such occupations include sales representatives, retail salespersons,
cashiers, real estate brokers, and advertising agents. Because workers in other occupations
are likely to spend a share of their time in selling activities also, we attribute 10 percent of
their time to selling as well. Examples of other occupations with a significant selling component are waiters, marketing and sales managers, and advertising and promotions managers.
Overall, this implies that 20 percent of working time is spent in selling activities.26 With
working time making up a third of total time, this yields a share of total time in selling of
6.5 percent. Finally, in reality not all of this time is spent on new customers. To take this
into account, we attribute a third of selling time to new customer acquisition, leading to our
2.13 percent number for selling time.
Turning to our target for buying time, time-use data document that Americans spend on
average 0.4 hours per day shopping. If we again attribute a third of this time to the new25

customer margin, our target for buying time becomes 0.53 percent of total time. Finally, we
adopt a quadratic specification for the function κ(ls ) = κ0 (ls )2 /2, where the value of κ0 can
be normalized to one.27 With this, the targets for buying and selling time determine unique
values for γ and ξ.

Table 1 summarizes our parametrization. Next, we turn to study the effects of product
market frictions on firms.

Level effects Product market frictions affect firms in a number of ways. Most directly,
the greater the frictions, the more firms spend on customer acquisition. The top left panel in
Figure 1 illustrates this by plotting steady-state selling expenses as a function of the matching
function coefficient ξ. In the frictionless limit, shown on the left, the model reduces to the
neoclassical adjustment cost model, where selling expenses are zero. In our benchmark
parametrization (indicated by the vertical line), on the other hand, these expenses make up
as much as five percent of sales revenue.
Product market frictions turn the customer base into a form of intangible capital, which
manifests itself in increased firm value, profits, and markups. In the frictionless limit, Tobin’s
q equals one (as firm value equals the value of physical capital), markups equal zero, and
the profit rate equals the cost of capital, r + δk = 0.15. In a frictional market, competition
for new customers drives the value of the marginal new customer to zero, but firm value
still exceeds the value of physical capital for two reasons. First, the value of the average
27

See Appendix B.

17

new customer exceeds that of the marginal, due to the convex costs of customer acquisition.
Second, existing customers are valuable assets to the firm because, to make up for the initial
costs of attracting them, the firm charges a positive markup on these customers later. As a
result, Tobin’s q is as high as 1.9 in our benchmark parametrization, with an average markup
of 15 percent. Similarly, averaging across new and existing customers leads to a firm profit
rate which, at 20 percent, exceeds the cost of capital.28 Perhaps surprisingly, these changes
have no effect on the investment rate, however, which continues to equal the depreciation
rate of capital.29
These changes in levels make the testable predictions that ceteris paribus in markets with
greater product market frictions, we should see greater average Tobin’s q, profit rates and
markups, than in markets with lesser frictions. Investment rates, on the other hand, should
remain unaffected. Moreover, the increasing relationship between product market frictions
and selling expenses suggests using data on selling expenses to quantify the degree of friction.

Firm dynamics

For thinking about the effects of product market frictions on firm dy-

namics, it is useful to start from the frictionless limit i.e. the neoclassical adjustment cost
model. In a frictionless product market, an increase in firm productivity leads to an instantaneous increase in firm sales and profits. Investment increases because the marginal
product, and shadow value, of capital increases, but the capital adjustment costs smooth
this investment response over time. As illustrated in Figure 2 (dashed line), investment rises
on impact, decaying with productivity. In this frictionless product market, the responses
of investment and Tobin’s q are identical, because Tobin’s q is proportional to the shadow
value of capital.30
Introducing product market frictions has two main effects on these firm dynamics. First,
by effectively imposing an additional adjustment cost on firm expansion, they work to
dampen firm responses to the shock. Second, by slowing down the expansion in sales, they
28

Recall that even if the present value of future profits the firm makes off of a customer just makes up for
the up-front costs of getting that customer, discounting implies that average profits across new and existing
customers must be positive.
29
The markups do translate into an increase in sales revenue per unit of capital, however, a statistic we
consider in our empirical work.

Notes: The figure plots the steady state as a function of the matching function parameter ξ. The frictionless
limit is on the left, and the vertical line indicates our baseline parametrization. Selling expenses refer to

generate hump-shaped responses in a number of variables. Figure 2 illustrates these changes
by plotting our benchmark parametrization (solid line) side-by-side with the frictionless limit
(dashed line).
In a frictional product market, the increase in productivity increases the firm’s production
capacity, but leaves the firm short of customers to sell to. This shortage of customers curbs
the increase in sales, as well as investment, in the short run. The first order of business
following the shock is an increase in selling expenses to expand the customer base, smoothed
over time by the convex costs of customer base expansion.31 Investment rises on impact,
but continues to rise further as the firm accumulates customers (and eventually finds itself
short of production capacity), generating a hump-shaped response.32 The response of firm
The convexity of κ(ls ) is important for this smoothing when studying responses to firm level shocks, as
otherwise firms would expand the customer base on impact. To see this, note that the reduced form of the
left hand side of the first order condition (10) for ls is γ −γ (1 − γ)γ−1 wκ′ (ls )1−γ /ξ.

Figure 2: Impulse Responses to Firm-Level Productivity Shock
Notes: The responses are in percentage deviations from steady state. Selling expenses refer to wκ(ls ), sales
to (1 − ls η(θ)ε)y, profit to sales net of labor costs of production and selling, and the markup to sales per
unit sold 1 − ls η(θ)ε/y over the marginal cost wlp /y × 1/(1 − α).

profits is also hump-shaped: Despite the increase in selling expenses, profits rise on impact as
production costs fall, but they also continue to rise as the surge in selling expenses subsides
and the customer base grows. Finally, product market frictions introduce a time-varying
wedge between the shadow value of capital and Tobin’s q, explaining the differing responses
of investment and Tobin’s q in the figure. The response of Tobin’s q reflects the response of
the shadow value of capital, but also the appreciation of the firm’s customer base in the face
of falling costs of production.
Overall, these changes in dynamics make the testable predictions that ceteris paribus in
markets with greater product market frictions, we should see: i) dampened firm responses to
the firm’s capital stock in response to shocks, a seemingly implausible feature. Without convex capital
adjustment costs, the short run response to a positive productivity shock would be to abruptly disinvest,
leading to a drop in capital, until the customer base expands sufficiently. The expansion in sales and profits
would continue to be hump-shaped, however, with Tobin’s q rising on impact.

20

shocks, and ii) investment, profits and sales lag Tobin’s q and selling expenses more strongly.

Investment regressions These dynamics suggest that product market frictions may be
useful for understanding the investment-q regression evidence, which appears at odds with
the neoclassical adjustment cost model: A large literature documents that firm investment
is only weakly correlated with Tobin’s q, appearing more correlated with firm cash flow
instead. These findings have sometimes been interpreted as evidence of firms facing financial
constraints, leading to capital misallocation.33
To study the predictions of the model for investment-q regressions, we run the following
regressions on simulated data from the model:
ijt /kjt = a0 + a1 qjt + εjt , and

(19)

ijt /kjt = a0 + a1 qjt + a2 πjt /kjt + εjt ,

(20)

where qjt = βEt vjt+1 /kjt+1 is Tobin’s q and the profit rate reflects firm cash flow. Figure 3
shows how the results of the first regression depend on the degree of friction in the product
market. In the frictionless limit (on the left) the model generates the results expected for the
neoclassical adjustment cost model: the coefficient on Tobin’s q coincides with the inverse of
the adjustment cost parameter, 1/ϕk = 0.1, and the R2 equals one. But as frictions increase,
both the slope coefficient and R2 fall, taking significantly lower values at our benchmark
parametrization (depicted by the vertical line). While the lower R2 reflects the weaker
correlation of investment with Tobin’s q (as illustrated by the impulse responses), the slope
coefficient is attenuated further by the reduced volatility of investment relative to Tobin’s
q.34
Figure 4 shows how the results change when we include firm cash flow in the regression.
In the frictionless limit cash flow is irrelevant, and investment perfectly explained by Tobin’s
q. But as frictions increase, the coefficient on Tobin’s q falls, while the coefficient on cash
flow quickly becomes significant. This reflects the similar responses of investment and profits
33

Caballero (1999) and Chirinko (1993) survey this literature.
Recall that the coefficient on Tobin’s q is a product of the correlation between investment and Tobin’s
q and the standard deviation of investment relative to Tobin’s q.

to shocks (illustrated by the impulse responses), relative to that of Tobin’s q. The model
would thus seem to predict non-trivial cash flow effects even for small frictions. As the
figure shows, the degree of friction has relatively little effect on the R2 from this regression,
however, because the two right-hand-side variables together explain investment well in the
model.
The coefficient estimates from these regressions are sometimes used to infer the magnitude
of capital adjustment costs – an approach which leads to the conclusion that these costs are
very high. Following the reasoning of Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995) or Hall (2001a): A
typical coefficient on Tobin’s q of 0.025 in an annual regression suggests adjustment costs
high enough for it to take a firm 1/0.025 = 40 years to double its capital stock. Figures 3 and
4 illustrate that this approach can lead to substantial overestimates for firms in frictional
product markets. Our benchmark parametrization yields a similar coefficient on Tobin’s q
with substantially smaller capital adjustment costs, roughly implying 1/0.1 = 10 years for a

firm to double its capital stock.35
Our theory makes the testable predictions that ceteris paribus in markets with greater
product market frictions, we should see regressions of investment on Tobin’s q yield: i) lower
coefficient estimates on Tobin’s q and ii) lower R2 ’s.

The mechanism: long-term customer relationships In the model product market
frictions lead to long-term customer relationships, as long as δn < 1. But one could also consider frictional markets without long-term relationships, by setting δn = 1. To highlight that
35

The aspect of the empirical evidence that the model will necessarily have difficulty replicating are the
very low R2 ’s in both panel and time series regressions. This is natural given that the model abstracts from
many other factors likely to influence the empirical results, including measurement error. With a simple
mechanism, the model generates quite low R2 ’s in the single regression of investment on Tobin’s q, but this
is much harder to accomplish in the multiple regression with cash flow included. In this sense, our results are
complementary with the literature emphasizing the importance of measurement error in Tobin’s q (Erickson
and Whited 2000, Eberly, Rebelo, and Vincent 2009), and finding more empirical success when other proxies
than stock prices are used to measure q (Abel and Blanchard 1986, Gilchrist and Himmelberg 1995, Cummins,
Hassett, and Oliner 2006, Philippon 2009).

23

such relationships play an important role for our results, Figure 5 compares firm responses in
frictional product markets with long-term customer relationships (solid line), to those in frictional product markets without long-term customer relationships (dashed line). Introducing
frictions dampens firm responses to shocks in both cases but, as the figure shows, long-term
customer relationships are essential for the hump-shaped responses emphasized. Table 2
confirms that this feature of the model is important also for our investment-q regression
results. By attenuating the relationship between investment and Tobin’s q, it significantly
reduces both the slope coefficient and R2 in these regressions.36

Figure 5: Impulse Responses to Firm-Level Productivity Shock with δn = 1
Notes: The responses are in percentage deviations from steady state. The model with δn = 1 is parameterized
to match the same targets for buying and selling time as the benchmark model. Selling expenses refer to
wκ(ls ), sales to (1 − ls η(θ)ε)y, profit to sales net of labor costs of production and selling, and the markup
to sales per unit sold 1 − ls η(θ)ε/y over the marginal cost wlp /y × 1/(1 − α).
36

It is this role of long-term customer relationships that differentiates ours from the decreasing-returns, or
monopolistic-competition, based explanations of the investment-q evidence pursued by Cooper and Ejarque
(2003) and Abel and Eberly (2009).

Sensitivity Finally, although the effects illustrated in the figures appear non-trivial in
magnitude, will they remain so if we change the parametrization to a plausible degree? To
examine this issue, Appendix B considers the sensitivity of our results to lower targets for
buying and selling time, as well as higher customer depreciation rates. We find that our
results are not strongly sensitive to the specifics of the parametrization used.

Aggregate shocks These changes in dynamics make frictional product markets promising
also for understanding the hump-shaped responses of macro-aggregates to aggregate shocks,
documented in a number of studies.37 Such hump-shaped responses are generally at odds
with the neoclassical growth model, where variables respond to shocks on impact. In the case
of investment in particular, recent literature has turned to non-standard capital adjustment
costs to generate hump-shaped responses to shocks.38 But are the model’s hump-shaped
responses preserved in the face of aggregate, instead of idiosyncratic, shocks?
There is a straightforward way to adapt the model for analyzing aggregate dynamics,
by assuming firms are identical in productivity – and consequently also in their capital and
customer base. The main changes involve: i) assuming firms are identical, ii) introducing
stochastic discount factors that capture aggregate variation in marginal utility, and iii) allowing variables such as wages, queue lengths, and discounts to vary over time.39 In this
case, the model implies that in times when firms hire more sales labor, both queue lengths
and discounts are greater.
Figure 14 in Appendix C illustrates model dynamics in response to an aggregate produc37

tivity shock, under frictional, as well as frictionless, product markets. The figure confirms
that the main predictions regarding volatility and hump-shaped responses of investment and
sales continue to hold also in the face of aggregate shocks. The main difference would seem
to be a weaker hump-shape in profits, likely due to the smaller increase in sales labor at
the aggregate, as well as a change in the shape of the response of Tobin’s q, likely due to
differences in discounting.

Evidence of Customer Capital

The model makes a number of predictions about the effects of product market frictions on
firm investment, sales, profits, value and their dynamic responses to shocks, which appear
promising for understanding documented patterns in the data. But is there any evidence
linking product market frictions to these patterns? In this section we turn to firm-level data
to document the evidence, using the model to make the link to product market frictions.
Seeking to establish relevance from a macroeconomic point of view, we consider a broad
range of industries.40

Data Our primary data source is Compustat, which provides annual accounting data on
publicly listed US firms. It is the standard data source for studying firm-level investment,
sales, profits and Tobin’s q. We restrict our analysis within Compustat to a balanced panel
of 648 firms from 1983 to 1999. Balancing simplifies the analysis of firm-level dynamics
significantly, but the results are largely robust to extending the sample to the full unbalanced
Compustat data (where possible). We exclude foreign firms, utilities and financial firms,
as commonly done in the investment literature, as well as mergers and observations with
extreme values. Appendix D describes the sample construction more closely.

Measuring frictions Because product market frictions are likely to be more important
in some markets than others, it is natural to use this cross-sectional variation to test the
40
A complementary approach, more in the spirit of industrial organization, would be to focus on a particular
industry, tailoring the model to fit the specifics of that market.

26

predictions of the model. The non-trivial challenge in doing so is finding a way to measure the
degree of friction across markets with available data. The theory suggests a simple approach
to this measurement problem, however, by predicting that in markets with greater frictions,
firms spend more on selling. Among the accounting variables reported in Compustat is
“selling, general and administrative” (SGA) expenses, which we use as a proxy for selling
expenses. Interpreting a market as a two-digit SIC industry, we compute a time-series
average of total industry SGA expenses over total industry sales, and sort industries into
two groups based on this measure: above and below median. We can then compare the two
subsamples on the various predictions of the model discussed in Section 3.
Our sorting variable, SGA expenses, includes selling expenses such as sales people’s
salaries, commissions and travel expenses, advertising and marketing expenses, shipping
expenses, depreciation of sales buildings and equipment, etc, but also general and administrative expenses such as executives’ salaries, legal and professional fees, insurance, office
rents, office supplies, etc. To gauge the extent to which variation in SGA expenses is driven
by selling expenses, we make use of the advertising expense data which is available separately
for a subset of firms. The two are relatively strongly correlated for firm-level data: For the
subset of firms reporting both, the cross-sectional correlation between firm-level advertising
and SGA expenses is 0.35, while the firm-level time-series correlation between the two is
0.41. The industries falling into our high and low SGA expense samples are given in Tables
11 and 12 in Appendix D. Consistent with intuition, commodities, for which product market
frictions are likely to play a smaller role, fall into the lower selling expense group, while
tobacco products and clothing retailers are examples of high selling expense markets. With
these considerations in mind, from this point on we refer to SGA expenses as selling expenses
(SE).
Table 3 provides summary statistics for our data, comparing the two subsamples we
study. Note that the firms in the sample are quite large overall, and although a large share
of firms are in manufacturing, a substantial share are not. The high selling expense sample
is slightly smaller, both in terms of numbers of firms, and share of total sales or assets.
Perhaps surprisingly, it is also more manufacturing intensive. The main message of the table

is that the two subsamples are relatively similar in firm attributes like size and growth rate,
although the high selling expense firms are perhaps slightly larger and faster-growing. There
are substantial differences in selling expenses across samples, with high selling expense firms
spending significantly more on advertising.41
Next, we turn to study the predictions of the model in this data. We examine, in turn,
the relationship between the level of selling expenses and: i) the levels and ii) volatility of
investment, sales, Tobin’s q, profits, and markups, iii) the lead-lag patterns, and iv) the
investment-q regressions.42
41

The advertising figure is calculated for the subset of firms with separate data on advertising.
Note that the experiment we conduct in the model differs somewhat from the one in the data: The
empirical experiment considers an economy with a number of goods, each demanded separately, where the
degree of friction in each particular good’s market varies across goods. The model, on the other hand,
abstracts from this heterogeneity for the sake of tractability. The implications of product market frictions
we have emphasized do not hinge on this simplification, however.
42

28

Levels The model predicts a positive relationship between the degree of product market
friction and the levels of Tobin’s q, profits, sales, and markups. To study this prediction, we
first compute, for each firm, time-series medians of Tobin’s q, profits/capital, sales/capital,
and markups.43 We then compute, for each subsample, medians across firms of these timeseries medians. Table 4 reports the results, revealing a significant increase in each of these
variables from the low to the high selling expense sample, as the model would predict. Also
consistent with the model, the investment rate remains similar across the subsamples.

Notes: The table reports, for each subsample, medians across firms of the time-series medians of firm investment/capital, profit/capital, sales/capital, sales/cost of goods sold, and Tobin’s q. Bootstrapped standard
errors – computed over 200 replications – are reported in parenthesis. The differences across samples are
significant at the one percent level for each variable.

Sorting industries into two groups has the advantage of leaving two relatively large samples to study. But it is useful to examine the evidence on an industry-by-industry basis as
well, even if sample sizes diminish in doing so. To this end, we compute medians across firms
of the above time-series medians also for each industry separately. The top panels in Figure
6 illustrate the results by plotting these measures of industry Tobin’s q and profits against
industry selling expenses. The figure reveals a clear positive relationship in both cases, as
well as significant variation across industries.
43
Note that our empirical measure of markup is a rather crude one, revenue over the production cost of
goods sold. The absolute levels of the sales/capital ratio are also significantly higher in the data than in the
model. The model abstracts from intermediate inputs, which raise the overall level of the sales/capital ratio
in the data.

Volatility The model predicts a negative relationship between the degree of product market friction and firm-level volatility. To study this prediction, we first compute, for each firm,
time-series standard deviations of investment/capital, sales/capital, profits/capital, Tobin’s
q and markups. We then compute, for each subsample, medians across firms of these timeseries standard deviations. The left column of Table 5 reports the results, revealing, instead
of a decrease, a modest to large increase in firm volatility from the low to the high selling
expense sample.

Notes: The table reports, for each subsample separately, medians across firms of the time-series standard
deviations of firm investment/capital, profit/capital, sales/capital, sales/cost of goods sold, and Tobin’s q.
Bootstrapped standard errors – computed over 200 replications – are reported in parenthesis. Relative to
Tobin’s q, the differences across samples are significant at the one percent level for each variable.

The intensity of idiosyncratic shocks varies across industries, however. One way to control
for this is to scale these measures of volatility by the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks.
While identifying these idiosyncratic shocks poses a non-trivial problem in itself, the model
dynamics suggest a simple approach: using Tobin’s q as a proxy for the shock. On the one
hand, Tobin’s q responds to shocks on impact, independent of the degree of friction. On the
other, it is relatively straightforward to measure given our data.44 We use Tobin’s q to study
changes in firm volatility as follows. For example in the case of investment we compute,
for each firm, the ratio of the time-series standard deviation of the investment rate to the
44

Moreover, Vuolteenaho (2002) argues that cross-sectional variation in Tobin’s q is largely driven by
variation in expected future cash flow. Firm-level variation in q should thus largely reflect variation in
fundamentals.

31

time-series standard deviation of Tobin’s q. We then compute, for each subsample, medians
across firms of these ratios.
The right columns of Table 5 report the results for firm volatility, revealing a significant
drop in the volatility of investment, sales as well as profits from the low to the high selling
expense sample, as the model would predict. For reference, Figure 10 in Appendix B plots
these relationships in the model.45 What is not consistent with the model is the observed
drop in the volatility of markups.
Finally, to examine the evidence on an industry-by-industry basis, we compute medians
across firms of the above ratios for each industry separately. The middle panels in Figure
6 illustrate the results by plotting these measures of firm-level volatility in investment and
sales against industry selling expenses. The figure reveals a clear negative relationship in
both cases.

Timing of responses We have emphasized that frictional product markets turn investment into a lagging variable. To study this prediction we compute, for each firm, time-series
correlations of investment with lags and leads of Tobin’s q, as well as selling expenses. We
then compute, for each subsample, medians across firms of these correlations. The top panels
in Figure 7 plot the results.
To help compare model and data, the bottom panels in Figure 7 plot the same correlations
in model-simulated data for versions of the model without frictions (dash-dotted line), with
frictions (solid line), as well as slightly lower frictions than our benchmark parametrization
(dashed line). As the figure shows, the model without frictions predicts a contemporaneous
relationship between investment and Tobin’s q, and no relationship between investment and
selling expenses. In the model with frictions, on the other hand, a lag pattern emerges:
investment becomes positively correlated with past values of Tobin’s q and selling expenses,
and much less so with future values.
The model with frictions clearly outperforms the model without frictions, by capturing
45

As frictions increase, the volatility of investment/capital, sales/capital and profits/capital fall, in absolute
terms as well as relative to the volatility of Tobin’s q. The volatility of markups, on the other hand, increases
independent of the measure.

Figure 7: Firm-Level Cross-Correlations of Investment with Tobin’s q and Selling Expenses
Notes: The top left panel plots, for each subsample separately, medians across firms of the time-series
cross-correlation of firm investment/capital with lags and leads of firm Tobin’s q. The top right panel plots
the same for investment/capital and selling expenses/capital. The bottom panels plot the same moments
for model-generated data for the fictionless model, the model with frictions, and the model with frictions
parameterized with slightly lower frictions than our benchmark. Tables 13 and 14 in Appendix D report the
numbers, including standard errors.

the lag-patterns in the data. Investment is, in both subsamples, positively correlated with
past values of Tobin’s q and selling expenses, and much less so with future values. These
lag-patterns are also somewhat stronger in the high selling expense sample, as the model
would predict, but the standard errors are too large to allow distinguishing the samples
statistically.46
46

Tables 13 and 14 in Appendix D report bootstrapped standard errors. As an alternative story, time-tobuild also generates lead-lag patterns, but renders investment dependent future Tobin’s q rather than past,
as investment decisions reflect the future value of capital. Time-to-plan has the opposite effect, offering
an alternative explanation for the overall lag pattern. It is not clear that time-to-plan would have any
implications for selling expenses, however.

33

Investment regressions Finally, turning to the predictions for investment-q regressions,
we run the panel regression
ij,t /kj,t−1 = a0 + a1 qj,t−1 + dt + fj + εj,t,

(21)

in both subsamples.47 Here dt controls for time effects and fj firm fixed effects. Table
6 reports the results, replicating the low slope coefficients and R2 ’s documented in the
literature. Comparing the two subsamples reveals that the results line up with our theory:
both the estimated slope coefficient and R2 fall significantly from the low to high selling
expense sample, independent of the specification.48 Running these panel regressions for
each industry separately only confirms this negative relationship between industry selling
expenses and both coefficient estimates and R2 ’s. The bottom panels of Figure 6 plot these
industry-by-industry results.
To relate our results to the literature emphasizing cash flow effects, we also run the
cash-flow augmented panel regression
ij,t /kj,t−1 = a0 + a1 qj,t−1 + a2 πj,t−1 /kj,t−1 + fj + dt + εj,t ,

(22)

in both subsamples. The results, reported in Table 7, line up with our theory also here.
Comparing the two subsamples, the slope coefficient on Tobin’s q drops significantly from the
low to high selling expense sample. Cash flow is clearly significant across the board, but not
necessarily increasing in selling expenses. Lastly, the differences in R2 across subsamples are
relatively small. These patterns are consistent with the predictions of the model, illustrated
in Figure 4.
Many studies of firm investment focus on manufacturing industries. Our sample, in
contrast, includes a substantial share of non-manufacturing firms as well, because we view
the model as well-suited for analyzing a broader set of industries than manufacturing alone.
47

We follow the standard timing of investment regressions in the empirical literature, by using lagged
values of Tobin’s q. The model regressions were instead run with the timing which is correct in the model.
48
In addition to being robust to including time and/or fixed effects in the regression, these results appear
to also be robust to changes in the definition of Tobin’s q, as well as changes in the timing and specification
of the regressions (levels versus logs).

To relate our findings to studies focusing on manufacturing, Tables 15 and 16 in Appendix D
report the results restricting the sample to manufacturing firms only. The main conclusions
continue to hold in this subsample.

Alternative theories A number of alternative theories have been proposed for the investmentq regression evidence. The main ones relax key assumptions of the neoclassical model, by introducing financing constraints (Gomes 2001, Lorenzoni and Walentin 2007, DeMarzo, Fishman, He, and Wang Forthcoming), market power (or decreasing returns to scale) (Cooper
and Ejarque 2003, Abel and Eberly 2009), or non-convex capital adjustment costs (Abel and
Eberly 1994, Caballero and Leahy 1996, Dixit and Pindyck 1994). The results of this crossindustry comparison – showing that investment-q regressions work less well in industries
with higher selling expenses – are particularly valuable in distinguishing our theory from
these alternatives. The concern that remains, however, is the possibility of a systematic

relationship between these alternative theories and selling expenses, which could explain the
results.
First, it seems quite plausible that firms in more frictional product markets might be
more affected by financing constraints, due to a larger share of firm value deriving from
intangible capital (arguably less likely to work as collateral). To assess the role of financing
constraints for our results, we examine the relationship between selling expenses and both
debt level and dividend payout. We find that firms in the high selling expense sample indeed
have slightly less debt (see Table 3), but because they also pay somewhat greater dividends,
it seems unlikely that financing constraints account for our results. The left panel of Figure
8 illustrates this relationship on an industry-by-industry basis. Second, to assess the role
of market power for our results, we examine the relationship between selling expenses and
industry concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl index.49 As the right panel of Figure
8 illustrates, this relationship is relatively weak and generally negative. Market power is thus
unlikely to account for our results. Finally, fixed costs are unlikely to play an important role
here because the firms in our sample are quite large.
49

The Herfindahl index is available at http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/concentration.html, along
with some alternatives. These alternative concentration indexes yield similar results.

Notes: The table reports the aggregate-level time-series standard deviations of investment/capital,
profit/capital, sales/capital, sales/cost of goods sold, and tobin’s q. Standard errors – computed using
Newey-West and the delta method – are reported in parenthesis. The differences across samples are significant at the one percent level for each variable, except the markup, both in absolute terms and relative to
Tobin’s q. For the markup, the difference is significant at the five percent level relative to Tobin’s q.

Aggregate shocks In addition to firm-level shocks, we can use the same data to study
responses to more aggregate-level shocks as well. The empirical variation we measure when
aggregating is, of course, very different from that at the firm level, offering an almost orthogonal test of the model predictions. To that end we compute, for each subsample, aggregate
time series of investment, sales, profits, and our other variables of interest by adding up the
firm-level observations at each point in time. Because the aggregate time series are relatively
short, we move to the quarterly data in Compustat for this exercise. As standard with aggregate data, we begin by taking logs, seasonally adjusting,50 and HP (1600)-filtering before
computing moments.51
We first return to examine the effects of product market frictions on volatility, now in
response to more aggregate-level shocks. To this end we compute, for each subsample, timeseries standard deviations of our aggregate time series. Table 8 reports the results, revealing
a significant drop in volatility from the low to high selling expense sample for investment,
50

The seasonal adjustment is done by regressing variables on quarter dummies and removing this seasonal
component.
51
Note that we follow convention in analyzing firm-level data in levels and aggregate data in logs. While
aggregate data are typically analyzed in logs, taking logs becomes problematic with firm-level data due to
negative observations (e.g. in profits).

37

sales and profits. Tobin’s q, on the other hand, is again significantly more volatile in the
high selling expense sample. As a result, if we again examined changes in volatility relative
to that of Tobin’s q, the drop in the volatility of investment, sales and profits would only
become more striking.52
We then return to examine the effect of product market frictions on investment-q regression results. We run, in each subsample, time-series regressions of aggregate investment on
Tobin’s q and cash flow. The results, reported in Table 9, are qualitatively similar to those at
the firm-level: Both the slope coefficient and R2 fall as we move from the low to high selling
expense sample, and cash flow is significant throughout. In this case the samples are harder
to distinguish statistically, however, because the number of observations in these time-series
regressions is small.53

quarterly data. Standard errors – computed using Newey-West – are reported in parenthesis. The P-values
for a decrease in the slope coefficient a1 moving from the low to the high selling expense sample are 0.15
and 0.45, respectively.

Industry shocks Finally, we also consider responses to industry-level shocks. We first
compute, for each 2-digit SIC industry, aggregate time series of our variables of interest
by adding up the firm-level observations at each point in time. We then compute, for
each industry, time-series standard deviations, as well as running time-series investment-q
regressions. Figure 9 illustrates the results: a negative relationship between industry selling
expenses and volatility (top panels), as well as industry selling expenses and investment-q
52

It may seem surprising that these numbers are larger than the standard deviations for firm-level shocks
in Table 5. Recall, however, that these numbers represent percentage variation (the data is logged first),
while the firm-level numbers represent absolute variation.
53
Note that the coefficient estimates are not directly comparable to those of the panel regressions, both
because the frequency is different, and because these regressions are in logs rather than levels.

Figure 9: Industry Selling Expenses vs Industry-Level Evidence: Volatility, Regressions
Notes: Each circle corresponds to a 2-digit SIC industry with ten or more firms. The horizontal axis shows
the time-series average of industry selling expenses relative to sales. The top two panels plot the time-series
standard deviations of industry investment and industry sales, and the bottom two results from the timeseries regression of industry investment on industry Tobin’s q. We include a fitted line for reference. For
expositional reasons, the axis scaling leaves two industries with low selling expenses and particularly high
investment volatility outside the top-left panel.

regression results (bottom panels).

Summing up The model makes a number of predictions which depend on the degree of
friction in the product market. The goal of this section has been to document the evidence on
these predictions, across a broad range of markets and levels of aggregation. Our measure of
selling expenses plays an important role in this by providing a way of quantifying the degree
of friction in a market, in order to link product market frictions to the various predictions we
examine. We find support for a broad range of these predictions, although the evidence is
arguably stronger for some predictions than others. The differences across samples are clearly
39

significant for the level effects, the relative volatilities, and regressions of investment on
Tobin’s q. Where the samples are harder to distinguish are the cross-correlations measuring
lagged responses, where the standard errors are larger.

Related Literature

The notion of a customer base has a history in macroeconomics dating back at least to
the seminal contribution of Phelps and Winter (1970). Well-know applications include Bils
(1989) and Rotemberg and Woodford (1991), who study the cyclical behavior of markups.
Work in this area has been somewhat limited, however, likely due to the complexity of
modeling these ideas in a general equilibrium setting, leading researchers to turn to the
Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) framework of monopolistic competition instead.
Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in modeling the customer base in various contexts, however. Building on Fishman and Rob (2003), Dinlersoz and Yorukoglu
(Forthcoming) develop a model of informative advertising and industry equilibrium and use
it to analyze the effects of a long-run decline in the costs of information dissemination on
market structure. Their framework is similar to ours in incorporating the customer base
as a state variable for firm decision-making, but unlike us, they abstract from firm investment decisions, focusing on entry and exit instead.54 Their empirical evidence is based on
time-series variation in advertising costs, whereas we focus on cross-industry variation in a
broader measure of selling costs. Recent empirical work by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2009) emphasizes the role of customer base concerns for firm/establishment expansion
in US manufacturing, showing that new establishments face a demand gap relative to existing ones which closes only slowly over time. Entry and exit are central also in the work of
Arkolakis (Forthcoming, 2010), who argues that the marketing costs of penetrating foreign
markets play an important role in firms’ export decisions. While Arkolakis abstracts from
long-term trade relationships, on-going work by Eaton, Eslava, Kugler, Krizan, and Tybout
54

Note that while search models of frictional product markets are common in the literature, appearing for
example in the seminal work of Kiyotaki and Wright (1989), models with long-term customer relationships
are not.

40

(2010) explicitly focuses on the dynamics of such relationships. Also in the international
setting, Drozd and Nosal (Forthcoming) develop a quantitative theory of export and import
prices, explicitly modeling the dynamic accumulation of market share in foreign markets.
While they emphasize the importance of product market frictions for understanding the dynamics of prices (with quantities more or less unaffected), our goal has instead been to argue
that frictions are important for understanding the dynamics of quantities. Finally, Ravn,
Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2006) study models where goods-level habit preferences lead to
persistence in demand, generating counter-cyclical markups, but their model abstracts from
the costs of selling and long-term customer relationships which are central in ours.55

Concluding Remarks

This paper studies, both theoretically and empirically, the implications of frictional product markets and long-term customer relationships for firm dynamics. To understand their
implications for firms, we first develop a tractable model framework, which builds on recent
developments in the search literature. The model makes a number of predictions which
appear promising for understanding documented patterns in the data. To establish the
empirical relevance of the model mechanism, we then use firm-level data to study these predictions, documenting broad support across a range of markets and degrees of aggregation.
In addition to developing our understanding of the demand-side determinants of firm dynamics, the findings are likely to have important implications for macroeconomic measurement
and policy, calling for further work.
55

Nakamura and Steinsson (Forthcoming) relax their assumption that habits are external, and show that
this can create an incentive for rigid prices when firms cannot commit. Another recent paper studying
pricing decisions in a model where the customer base is explicitly a state variable for firms is Kleshchelski
and Vincent (2009), who study cost pass-through in the face of industry-level shocks. Within the search
framework, Menzio (2007) and Shi (2011) study price dynamics in models of directed search in the product
market with long-term customer relationships.

Appendix
A

Planning Problem

This section shows that the optimality conditions of the planning problem in Section 3
coincide with those of the market equilibrium. We focus on the first order conditions, due
to the strict concavity of the planning problem.
The envelope conditions of the planning problem read, for a given x = (k, n, z),
Vn (λ) = uc (c, l) − ul (c, l)ℓpy (k, y(x), z) + β(1 − δn )Ez Vn (λ′ ),

(23)

Vk (λ) = −uc (c, l)φk (i(x), k) − ul (c, l)ℓpk (k, y(x), z) + β(1 − δk )Ez Vk (λ′ ).

(24)

The FOC for ls (x) reads
κ′ (ls (x)) = ms (lb (x), ls (x))

Vn (λ)
,
ul (c, l)

(25)

the FOC for lb (x)
1 = mb (lb (x), ls (x))

Vn (λ)
,
ul (c, l)

(26)

and the FOC for i(x)
φi (i(x), k) = βEz

Vk (λ′ )
.
uc (c, l)

(27)

Defining w := ul (c, l)/uc(c, l), vn (λ) := Vn (λ)/uc (c, l) and vk (λ) := Vk (λ)/uc (c, l), the

47

envelope conditions can be written as
uc (c′ , l′ )
vn (λ) = 1 −
+ β(1 − δn )Ez
vn (λ′ ),
uc (c, l)
uc (c′ , l′ )
vk (λ) = −φk (i(x), k) − wℓpk (k, y(x), z) + β(1 − δk )Ez
vk (λ′ ).
uc (c, l)
wℓpy (k, y(x), z)

(28)
(29)

Restricting attention to a stationary environment implies that consumption and leisure remain constant, so uc (c′ , l′ )/uc (c, l) = 1. The envelope conditions thus reduce to those of the
market equilibrium. Similarly, equation (27) reduces to the market condition (12).
Combining equations (25) and (26) implies: θ(x) = γ/(1 − γ) × κ′ (ls (x)) i.e. equation
(3) characterizing market equilibrium. Moreover, equation (25) implies that
w

κ′ (ls (x)) θ(x)η ′ (θ(x))
+
vn (λ) = vn (λ).
η(θ(x))
η(θ(x))

(30)

If we define ε(x) := θ(x)η ′ (θ(x))/η(θ(x)) × vn (λ), this equation reduces to equation (10)
characterizing the market equilibrium, with ε(x) playing the role of the discount. Defining
the discount in this way also implies that the market condition (11) holds. Finally, equation
(26) reduces to w = η ′ (θ(x))vn (λ), or w = µ(θ(x))ε(x). This implies equation (4).

Parametrization, Solution Method and Sensitivity

Solution method We solve the model numerically, using a log-linear approximation around
the non-stochastic steady state. More precisely, we first solve for the non-stochastic steady
state, and then log-linearize the model around this steady state. This solution method has
the advantage that, by abstracting from non-linearities in firm dynamics, it underlines the
fact that the key mechanism in our model does not rely on non-linearities. The system of
equations is available in an online appendix.56 We use the same approach also for the model
aggregate shocks.
56

See: http://people.bu.edu/rudanko/papers/customer_capital_onlineapp.pdf

48

Parametrization of γ and ξ

These parameters are determined by targets for total buying

and selling time. In the non-stochastic steady state of the model, integrating over measure
one identical firms gives total buying time lb , and total selling time κ(ls ). Given our targets
for lb and κ(ls ), and the assumption that κ(ls ) = (ls )2 /2, Proposition 1 directly implies that
γ = lb /(lb + (ls )2 ). The value of γ is thus determined by the relative shares of time in buying
and selling activities. Given these shares, the overall scale of buying and selling time is
increasing in the degree of friction, and thus the targets for buying and selling time also pin
down ξ.

Moments in the model As illustrated by Figure 10, the model predicts a dampening in
firm investment, sales, profits and Tobin’s q as frictions increase. Observing higher volatility
in the high selling expense subsample thus suggests that firms in that sample may face a
more variable shock process. This means that testing for the reduction in volatility due to
product market frictions requires controlling for the shock process. To this end, we scale
the standard deviations of investment, sales and profits by that of Tobin’s q. As the figure
confirms, the model predicts that also these scaled moments decrease in the friction.

Sensitivity To assess the sensitivity of our results to the parametrization, we vary the
targets for buying time, selling time, and customer depreciation. Figure 11 shows how the
dynamics change when steady-state buying time is reduced by 50 percent to 0.265, Figure
12 when steady-state selling time is reduced by 50 percent to 1.15, and Figure 13 when the
customer depreciation rate is increased by 50 percent to 22.5. Table 10 shows how these
changes affect the various simulated moments of the model.

Model with Aggregate Shocks

This section adapts the model to a setting with aggregate fluctuations in productivity. Suppose we alter the economy such that all firms have the same productivity each period, which
fluctuates over time according to a Markov process. In those circumstances all firms will
(eventually) be identical in size, but the size will fluctuate over time response to aggregate
shocks. Aggregate shocks lead to fluctuations in the price of consumption, which must be
taken into account in discounting firm profits, as well as evaluating the returns to search.
The household problem now reads
maxE0

∞
X

β t u(ct , 1 − ltm − ltb )

t=0

s.t. ct ≤ wt ltm + wtb ltb + Πt , ∀t ≥ 0.
This problem differs from the previous household problem because here the wage wt , return
to search wtb and dividends Πt fluctuate over time in response to aggregate shocks. The
household now maximizes expected utility over this uncertainty about the future. As before,
the return to search satisfies wtb = µ(θt )εt , with wt = wtb for all t in any equilibrium where
the household spends time in both market work and search.
Firms choose output yt , investment it , production labor ltp , sales labor lts , queues θt , and
discounts εt , for all t, conditional on the realization of the aggregate shock history up to time
t, to
maxE0

∞
X

β̃t [yt − lts η(θt )εt − wt ltp − wt κ(lts ) − φ(it , kt )]

t=0

s.t. yt ≤ nt + lts η(θt ),
yt ≤ f (kt , ltp , zt ),
nt+1 ≤ (1 − δn )yt ,
kt+1 ≤ (1 − δk )kt + it ,
wtb = µ(θt )εt .

54

This firm problem differs from the previous one in three ways: i) all firms face the same
productivity realization, ii) the wage (and return to search) fluctuate over time, and iii) firms
discount future profits with the probability-normalized prices β̃t instead of β t . Starting all
firms with the same initial conditions implies that they remain identical forever. Aggregate
variables are thus just a multiples of firm level variables and the measure of firms, one. The
firm optimality conditions now imply that: i) all firms offer the same discount and have
identical queues, and ii) in times when firms hire more sales people, queues are longer and
discounts (relative to wages) higher:
PROPOSITION 2. Queues and discounts are increasing in the choice of sales personnel
lts : θt = γ/(1 − γ) × κ′ (lts ) and εt = wt θt1−γ /ξ.
The definition of equilibrium extends with straightforward changes from the text.

Notes: The responses are in percentage deviations from steady state. Selling expenses refer to wκ(ls ), sales
to (1 − ls η(θ)ε)y, profit to sales net of labor costs of production and sales, and the markup to sales per unit
sold 1 − ls η(θ)ε/y over the marginal cost wlp /y × 1/(1 − α).

Data

For comparability with existing literature, we use the Compustat industrial annual data from
1983 to 1999, with the following standard exclusions: First, we drop firms with primary SIC
classification between 6000 and 6999 and between 4900 and 4999, representing utilities and
financial firms. We also drop foreign firms. Second, we drop firms with negative or zero
book value of capital (Items 7 and 8), sales (Item 12), assets (Item 6), selling, general and
administrative expenses (Item 189), cost of goods sold (Item 41). We also drop firms with
negative advertising (Item 45) or R&D (Item 46). Observations with a merger flag in year t
are dropped from the sample in years t − 1, t and t + 1. To minimize the impact of extreme
observations, we drop as outliers firms which have in a given year a profit rate above 10 or
less than −4, an investment rate above 3, or Tobin’s q above 10.
Investment is measured as Item 30, but netting out capital sales (Item 107) would not
affect the results significantly. Earnings are measured as operating income (Item 13). The investment rate is measured as (Item 30)/(Item 7 lagged) and the profit rate as (Item 13)/(Item
7 lagged). Debt is measured as Item 9, dividends as Item 21+Item 19.
Finally, we balance the panel, keeping only firms with observations for all of the above
variables between 1983 and 1999. This leaves 648 firms, with 11, 016 firm-year observations.
Balancing facilitates studying time-series dynamics at the firm level, which requires repeated
observations for each firm over time. Our Stata code is available on request.
