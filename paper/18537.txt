Vulnerable Banks

NBER Working Paper No. 18537
November 2012
JEL No. G01,G21,G38
ABSTRACT
When a bank experiences a negative shock to its equity, one way to return to target leverage is to sell
assets. If asset sales occur at depressed prices, then one bank’s sales may impact other banks with
common exposures, resulting in contagion. We propose a simple framework that accounts for how
this effect adds up across the banking sector. Our framework explains how the distribution of bank
leverage and risk exposures contributes to a form of systemic risk. We compute bank exposures to
system-wide deleveraging, as well as the spillover of a single bank’s deleveraging onto other banks.
We show how our model can be used to evaluate a variety of crisis interventions, such as mergers
of good and bad banks and equity injections. We apply the framework to European banks vulnerable
to sovereign risk in 2010 and 2011.

I. Introduction
Financial stress experienced by banks can contaminate other banks and spiral into a shock
that threatens the broader financial system: this is systemic risk. The measurement of systemic risk
has been high on financial regulators’ priority list since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers,
which triggered widespread financial distress among large US financial institutions. The recent
sovereign debt crisis and corresponding concerns about the solvency of European banks system have
only made the need to measure system-wide stability more acute.
Recent literature emphasizes two main channels through which the linkages between
financial institutions can create contagion. The first relies on contractual dependencies: when two
banks write a financial contract such as a swap agreement, a negative shock to one bank can transmit
to the other party as soon as one of the banks is unable to honor the contract (e.g., Allen and Babus
2009, Gorton and Metrick 2010, Giglio, 2011). Bilateral links of this kind can propagate distress,
because the creditor bank may in turn lack the funds needed to deliver on its on its obligations to
third parties (Duffie 2010, Kallestrup et al., 2011, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2011). 1
A second type of linkage comes from fire-sale spillovers: when a bank is forced to sell
illiquid assets, the sale may depress prices because of a lack of unconstrained buyers, which in turn
can prompt financial distress at other banks that hold the same assets. Liquidation spirals of this sort
have been explored in an extensive theoretical literature. 2 In a financial system of greater complexity
and in which claims on households and firms are increasingly tradable (Schwarcz, 2008), such
spirals are widely believed to have become an important contributor to systemic risk.

This paper puts forth a simple and easily calibratable model of fire-sales spillovers that can
be readily estimated using available data. The model takes as given (1) the asset holdings of each
financial institution, (2) an adjustment rule applied by institutions when they are hit by adverse
shocks and (3) the liquidity of these assets on the secondary market (i.e., the ability of banks to sell
these assets quickly with little price discount). Our main objective is to develop simple formulas of
how fire sale spillovers add up across the financial sector, and how susceptible individual banks are
to episodes of deleveraging by other banks.
An appealing feature of our approach is that we distinguish between a bank’s contribution to
financial sector fragility (which we call its “systemicness”), and a bank’s vulnerabilty to
deleveraging by other banks. Our model allows us to compute formulas for both. To see the
difference, consider a small but highly levered bank with a portfolio of risky assets. Such a bank
may be quite vulnerable to financial sector deleveraging, yet is unlikely to be systemic. This is
because asset sales triggered by its potential distress will be modest in size, thus not triggering much
in the way of spillovers.
The model has a number of intuitive properties concerning how the distribution of leverage
and risk exposures across banks determines systemic risk. For instance, consider a negative return
shock experienced by an asset that is held by relatively levered banks. This shock has a larger
aggregate impact than if the same asset was held by the less levered institutions. More generally, we
show that the banking system is less stable to shocks when asset classes that are large in dollar terms
are also held by the most levered banks. If the goal is to reduce fire sale spillovers, then assets that
are both volatile and illiquid should be dispersed across banks, since the same shocks generate less
price impact in a deleveraging cycle. In contrast, if illiquid assets have low price volatility, then it is

2

better to isolate these assets in separate banks, so that they are not contaminated by other assets,
which in turn are subject to larger shocks.
The model can easily be used to simulate the outcome of various policies to reduce fire sale
spillovers in the midst of a crisis. As an example of such policy analysis, consider a forced merger
between two vulnerable banks—Sorkin (2009) suggests this was one of the initiatives entertained by
the New York Federal Reserve during the US financial crisis. Such a policy may affect systemic risk
because it redistributes existing assets across banks, which may have different exposures to shocks,
different sizes, or different leverage ratios. As another example, consider the policy question of how
to distribute a fixed amount of equity capital from the government across a large set of distressed
banks. It should not be surprising that stabilization policies that aim to fix insolvency at individual
banks can be inferior to policies that directly target the cross-bank spillovers.
We apply the model to European banks during the 2010-2011 sovereign debt crisis. For a
large set of these banks, we have measures of sovereign bond exposures derived from the European
Banking Authority's (EBA) July 2011 stress tests. We then use these exposures to estimate the
potential spillovers which could occur during bank deleveraging precipitated by sovereign
downgrades or defaults. Using the risk exposures as inputs, we document a correlation between our
estimates of bank vulnerability and equity drawdowns experienced by European banks in 2010 and
2011. We then use our data to evaluate various policy interventions. We find that size caps, or forced
mergers among the most exposed banks do not reduce systemic risk very much. However, we show
that modest equity injections, if distributed appropriately between the most systemic banks, can cut
the vulnerability of the banking sector to deleveraging by more than half.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We first develop the model, solve it, and
build intuition for financial sector stability under different configurations of leverage and risk

3

exposure across the banks. In Section III, we explain how our approach fits into, and contributes to,
a growing literature on systemic risk. In Section IV, we use commercial bank exposures provided by
the EBA’s July 2011 stress tests to compute the vulnerability of European banks to sovereign
defaults. Section V explains how the model can be adapted to monitor vulnerability on a more
dynamic basis using factor exposures. The final section concludes.

II. A Model of Bank Deleveraging
We start by describing the framework. We then use it to derive easy-to-implement measures
of systemic risk, at the bank and aggregate levels.
A. Setup
There are two periods t=1,2, and N banks. Each bank n is financed with a mix of debt d nt and
equity e nt . A t is the N×N diagonal matrix of banks’ assets so that each diagonal term a nt = e nt + d nt at
date t. B is the N×N diagonal matrix of leverage ratios, such that each diagonal term b n =d nt /e nt .
Each bank n holds a portfolio of K assets: m nk is the weight of asset k in bank n’s portfolio. M
is the N×K matrix of these weights. In each period, the vector of banks’ unlevered returns is:
(1)

R t =MF t ,
where the K×1 vector F t denotes asset net returns.

Assumption 1: Asset trading in response to bank return shock
Suppose banks receive an exogenous shock R 1 to their assets at t=1. Because banks are
levered, these shocks move banks away from their current leverage. We assume that banks respond
by scaling up or down their total assets in period 2 so as to maintain a fixed target leverage. Such
leverage-targeting is in line with empirical evidence in Adrian and Shin (2010), who show that banks

4

manage leverage to offset shocks to asset values. 3 Adrian and Shin's evidence implicitly suggests
that banks do not raise equity in response to a negative shock. 4 However, the analysis that follows
does not change much if we instead assume that banks return to target leverage using a combination
of asset sales and equity issues in fixed proportion.
If banks target leverage ratios given by the matrix B, then the N×1 vector of dollar net asset
increases is simply A 1 BR 1 . When R 1 <0, banks with negative asset returns have to sell assets to
deleverage. When R 1 >0, banks with positive returns need to borrow more to preserve leverage. The
intuition of this formula is simple: suppose a bank with equity of 1 and debt of 9 experiences a 10%
return on its assets, bringing its equity to 2. The bank will have to borrow an additional 9 and buy
assets to return to the prior leverage of 9-to-1. 5 In practice, banks will have more flexibility in
dealing with a positive shock to bank equity, and so our model will be more useful for thinking
about dynamics following negative
If some elements of R 1 are negative and very large, then it is possible that the A 1 BR 1 vector
may have some negative elements that are bigger in absolute value than banks’ assets. This happens
if the initial shock is large enough to wipe out all of the equity of the bank, in which case no amount
of asset sales will return the bank to target leverage. To prevent this from happening, we can modify
the vector of net asset increases by replacing it by A 1 .max(BR 1 ,-1-R 1 ), where “max” is the pointwise maximum matrix operator, defined by max(X,Y)=(max(X n ,Y n )). In Section IV we use this

3

They provide evidence that commercial banks target a constant leverage ratio, while investment banks have procyclical
leverage, which means that their leverage adjustments more than offset the changes in leverage induced by shocks to
asset values.

4

In situations where debt overhang is severe, issuing equity dilutes existing shareholders as the gains from the reduction
in risk accrue disproportionately to debt holders.

5

Essentially we are treating banks as similar to leveraged exchange traded funds (ETFs), which must readjust to their
target leverage at the close of trading each day. See Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap, and Shin (2008) and Adrian and Shin
(2009) for further discussion of this point and related evidence.

5

modified formula, because the shocks we consider in Europe are large enough to wipe out some
banks. But to simplify the exposition that follows, for now we keep the simpler linear formula.
Assumption 2: Target exposures remain fixed in percentage terms
Second, we must describe how banks sell individual assets to return to target leverage. We
make the simplest assumption that banks sell assets in such a way as to hold the M matrix constant
between dates 1 and 2. This assumption has been widely used in the mutual fund literature (Coval
and Stafford, 2007, Greenwood and Thesmar, 2011, and Lou, 2011). Let φ be the K×1 vector of net
asset (dollar) purchases by all banks in period 2. If banks keep their portfolios constant, then:

φ =M' A 1 BR 1 .

(2)

To see the intuition, consider a bank with holdings of 10 percent cash, 20 percent in stocks and 70
percent in mortgage backed securities. If the bank scales down its portfolio by ten units, it will sell 2
units of stocks, 7 units of mortgage backed securities, and take its cash down by 1. Equation (2)
describes this in matrix form, summed over all banks: for each bank n facing a shock R 1n , total net
asset purchase (i.e., the increase in assets net of returns) will be given by a n b n R 1n . Net purchases of
asset k by the bank will be proportional to its holdings of asset k, i.e., m nk a n b n R 1n . Equation (2) sums
this expression across all n banks.
We have experimented with variations of this assumption—which is admittedly strong—
because in practice banks may first sell their most liquid assets. The constant portfolio assumption
simplifies the algebra and the intuition below, but we show later (Section IV F) that the framework
can be quite easily modified to account for more sophisticated liquidation rules.

6

Assumption 3: Fire sales generate price impact
Third, we assume that asset sales in the second period φ generate price impact according to a
linear model:
F 2 =Lφ ,

(3)

where L is a matrix of price impact ratios, expressed in units of returns per dollar of net purchase. 6
For purely expositional purposes we implicitly assume here that L is diagonal, meaning that fire
sales in one asset do not directly affect prices in other assets. Yet, our equations are not modified if L
is not diagonal. 7
For assets with uncorrelated payoffs, equation (3) can be easily microfounded. Suppose there
are outside investors with a fixed dollar amount of outside wealth W who provide liquidity to the
banking sector during a fire sale, but trade off the returns to outside projects with the returns to
investing in fire sold assets. In such a setting, the equilibrium discount will be an increasing function
of the total dollar amount of fire sold assets (See Stein (2012)).
We combine equations (1), (2) and (3) to calculate the effect of bank unlevered asset returns
in t=1 on returns in t=2:
(4)

R 2 =MF 2 =MLφ =(MLM'BA 1 )R 1 .

In principle, one can iterate multiple rounds of deleveraging following an initial shock, by further
multiplying by the transition matrix MLM'BA 1 . Taken to the limit, the deleveraging process ends at a
fixed point, which is a function of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. For simplicity, we restrict

6

For instance, Pulvino (1998) estimates the discount associated with fire sales of commercial aircraft by distressed
airlines. In equity markets, Coval and Stafford (2007) estimate the L coefficient using forced purchases and sales of stock
by mutual funds (see also Ellul et al, 2011, and Jotikasthira et al, 2011 who use similar methodologies in other asset
markets). Bank loans can also be sold on fairly liquid markets (Drucker and Puri, 2008).
7
Greenwood (2005) develops a model in which price impact spreads across similar assets. To the extent that offdiagonal elements are positive, this would further amplify the effects discussed below.

7

our attention to the first round of deleveraging, because this delivers most of the useful intuitions
about the relevant linkages between banks.
B. Measuring Aggregate Exposures to Deleveraging (“Aggregate Vulnerability”)
We start with a negative shock -F 1 =(-f 1 ,...,-f n ) to asset returns: this translates into dollar
shocks to banks' assets given by A 1 MF 1 . The aggregate direct effect on all bank assets the quantity is
then 1'A 1 MF 1 , where 1 is the N×1 vector of ones. This direct effect does not involve any contagion
between banks, it is simply the change in asset value.
Following equation (4), to compute the aggregate dollar effect of shock F 1 on bank assets
through fire sales, we pre-multiply MLM'BA 1 MF 1 by 1'A 1 . We normalize this by total bank equity
pre-delevering E 1 and define “aggregate vulnerability” as:

AV =

1' A1MLM ' BA1MF1
.
E1

(5)

AV measures the percentage of aggregate bank equity that would be wiped out by bank deleveraging
if there was a shock F 1 to asset returns. As a reminder, this formula omits the direct impact of the
shock on net worth, emphasizing only the spillovers across banks. If all assets are perfectly liquid
(i.e., all elements of the L matrix are zero), then AV=0: there is no contagion across banks because
delivering does not involve price impact, even though there is still a direct effect of the shock on
banks asset values given by 1'A 1 MF 1 .
To understand the intuition behind Eq. (5), using -R 1 =-MF 1 =(-r 1t ,...,-r nt )', we can rearrange
terms slightly and expand:
AV × E1 =
∑ γ nbn an1rn1 ,

(6)

n

8



where γ n = ∑∑ am mmk lk mnk measures the “connectedness” of bank n. This is the extent to which

k  m

bank n owns large ( ∑ an mnk large) or illiquid (l k large) asset classes. Where this is the case, one
n

dollar of fire sales by bank n will lead to a larger amount of the banking system’s holdings, since it
will reduce by more the price of larger asset classes.
Equation (6) shows that the systemic risk is large when large banks (banks with large a n1 ) are
levered (large b n1 ), exposed to the shock in question (r n1 ), or connected (large γ n ). These properties
are intuitive: if large banks are levered and/or exposed, a given shock will trigger larger asset sales.
In addition, if exposed banks hold assets that are illiquid and/or widely held, then price impact is
large and the overall system is more vulnerable. More generally, the four elements of equation (6) –
connectedness, leverage, size, and exposure – enter multiplicatively in determining AV. This means
that the distribution of these elements across the financial system matters enormously for systemic
risk. For example, the formula tells us that from the perspective of spillovers, the correlation
between bank size and leverage is an important input.

C. Contribution of each Bank to Deleveraging: “Systemicness”
We can calculate the contribution that each bank has -- through contagion -- on the aggregate
vulnerability of the banking system. To do this, we again focus on the impact of a shock F 1 , but
assume it only affects bank n. In this case, it is easy to see that the impact coming from the
liquidations of bank n on the aggregate of the banking system is:
S(n) =

1' A1 MLM' BA1δ nδ 'n MF1
,
E1

(7)

9

where δ n is the N×1 vector with all zeros except for the nth element, which is equal to 1. We call S(n)
the “systemicness” of bank n. Systemicness can be interpreted as the contribution of bank n to
aggregate vulnerability, as AV = ∑ S (n ).
n

As we did for aggregate vulnerability, we can develop intuition by expanding terms in
equation (7):

a 
S (n) = γ n ×  n  × bn × rn1 ,
 E1 

(8)

which is the bank-level equivalent of Equation (6). Thus, a bank is more systemic if:
•

It is more connected (γ n is bigger): the bank owns assets that are both illiquid and widely
held by other banks.

•

It is bigger (a n /E 1 is bigger): a given shock on a larger bank leads to more fire sales, which
in turn leads to a large price impact.

•

It is more levered (b n is bigger): a shock to a more levered bank is going to induce it to sell
more, which generates more price-impact.

•

It receives a bigger shock r n1 .

D. Impact of Deleveraging on each Bank: Indirect Vulnerability
We define a bank’s “indirect vulnerability” with respect to shock F 1 as the impact of the
shock on its equity through the deleveraging of other banks:

IV (n) =

δ 'n A1MLM ' BA1MF1
en1

.

(9)

IV(n) measures the fraction of equity of bank n that disappears when other banks deleverage
following shock F 1 . It differs from direct vulnerability, which measures the direct exposure of bank
n’s assets to shock F 1 :

10

DV (n) =

δ 'n A1MF1
.
en1

(10)

In our empirical applications, we will systematically contrast the two measures: IV involves the
deleveraging spiral, while DV does not.
To understand the intuition behind IV(n), we can expand terms in equation (9):





×  ∑ mn ' k an 'bn ' rn '   .
IV (n) =(1 + bn ) × ∑  lk mnk

 k
n'


illiquidityweighted
 
leverage
fire sales of asset k
 exposure to asset k


(11)

The first term stands for the pure leverage effect: a given asset shock has a bigger impact on equity if
the bank is more levered. The second term measures the importance of connections between banks.
It is large when the bank is exposed to assets that are illiquid and exposed to heavy fire sales. Notice
that IV(n) conceptually differs from “systemicness”. For instance, a small bank can be vulnerable
(IV(n) is large) without being systemic (S(n) small).

E. Indirect Vulnerability to a specific bank
Suppose one is interested in the impact of a single bank deleveraging (for example, if it were
to fail and its assets were liquidated). In this case, we can compute IV in the special case where the
vector of banks' returns R 1 =σ.δ m , i.e. assuming that bank m (and only bank m) will deleverage
following a shock σ to it assets. Then, following equation (9), the indirect vulnerability of bank n to
a decrease of bank m's assets by σ % is:

IV (n, m) = σ

δ 'n A1MLM ' BA1δ m
.
en1

(12)

11

This measure captures the interdependence through deleveraging of banks n and m. IV(n,m) is large
when sender bank m is large and levered, when receiver bank n is levered, and more interestingly
when the term δ n ' MLM'δ m is big, i.e., when n and m own similar illiquid assets.

F. Theoretical Properties
i.

Heterogeneity and Systemic Risk
One implication of equation (6) is that making the banks more similar may reduce fire sale

spillovers, and thus AV. This contrasts with much of the existing literature on systemic risk, which
assumes that systemic risk is high when banks have correlated stock returns. 8 The economic
intuition for this comes from two opposing effects. First, because banks liquidate all assets they hold
when they are shocked, shocks to liquid assets trigger fire sales of illiquid assets when banks own
both types. This can make it stabilizing to ring-fence the illiquid assets into specific banks. There is,
however, also an effect that makes diversification desirable: when all banks own all assets, any
shock to asset prices will spread the fire sales across all asset holdings, which tends to reduce the
total price impact. The diversification effect dominates when illiquid (high l k ) assets receive stronger
shocks (high f k ): diversified (correlated) banks are better, because they can react to these shocks by
partly selling liquid assets which reduces global price impact. But when liquid (low l k ) assets receive
bigger shocks (high f k ), the contagion effect is more important. In this case, stability can be
increased by isolating the illiquid assets into specific banks.
To illustrate this intuition more formally, consider the case of N assets and N banks of
identical size a and leverage b. Suppose that assets are equally spread across banks (heterogeneity),

8

A notable exception is Wagner (2011) who considers a similar set of issues about the distribution
of risks between banks.

12

̅
we have M=(11’)/N (this is a matrix where all coefficients are equal to 1/N) and 𝐴𝑉 = 𝑎2 𝑏 ∑𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑙 𝑓𝑖

𝑁
̅
where 𝑙 =(∑
𝑖=1 𝑙𝑖 )/𝑁 is the average liquidity of assets. In contrast, if each asset is exclusively held

by one bank dedicated to that asset (homogeneity) M=Id., and 𝐴𝑉 = 𝑎2 𝑏 ∑𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑙𝑖 𝑓𝑖 .

Thus

̅
homogeneity leads to lower AV than heterogeneity if ∑𝑁
𝑖=1(𝑙 −𝑙𝑖 )𝑓𝑖 > 0, i.e. when assets with large

shocks tend to be more illiquid.
ii.

Absence of a “too big to fail” effect
Another somewhat surprising property of our framework is that AV is not directly impacted

by the size of banks. For instance, we can prove that slicing a bank into n smaller banks, with the
same asset mix and leverage as the original bank, leaves AV unchanged (see appendix A). This is
because each of these new banks reacts to shocks exactly as the original bank, scaled by the ratio of
their sizes. Thus, the combined impact on the rest of the system is exactly identical to that of the
original banks. Conversely, merging banks with same asset mix and leverage also leaves AV
unchanged.

III. Relation to Literature on Systemic Risk
We follow a growing literature that studies linkages between financial institutions and the
implications for systemic risk. The tradition in recent papers has been to infer bank linkages from
correlations in market prices. A first set of papers seeks to estimate risk directly from bond or CDS
(see for instance Ang and Longstaff (2011)). Giglio (2011), for example, uses the difference between
bond and CDS spreads to estimate the joint probability of failure of large banks who are sellers of
protection. A second set of papers measures systemic risk through comovement in the equity returns
of financial intermediaries (Adrian and Brunnermeier (2010), Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon and
Richardson (2010), Billio, Getmansky, Lo, and Pelizzon (2010), Diebold and Yilmaz (2011)).

13

Our framework departs from some of this literature by making simple assumptions about
how funding shocks propagate across banks, i.e., we posit an economic structure to the propagation
mechanism of initial shocks. To do so comes at some cost—we adopt a narrow definition of
systemic risk based on banks’ common exposures, thus deemphasizing bilateral risks such as
counterparty risk. On the other hand, the benefits are that our model-based approach can be used to
do policy analysis.
The structure of our model is similar to Acemoglu, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi (2010), who
study the propagation of shocks in the real economy. They derive conditions under which aggregate
volatility remains high even when the network is large. Assuming their asymptotic approximation is
correct for a large universe of banks, some of their insights could conceivably be applied here.
A contribution of our model relative to existing work is that it distinguishes between a bank’s
contribution to the risk of aggregate deleveraging (“systemicness”), and a bank’s sensitivity to
deleveraging by other banks (“indirect vulnerability”). Adrian and Brunnermeier (2010) define and
estimate the “CoVaR” of institution n as the Value at Risk of the whole financial sector conditional
on bank n being in distress. In our model, “systemicness” S(n) is similar to their CoVaR measure;
the main difference being that, while CoVaR is estimated using comovement in stock returns, we put
structure on the propagation mechanism, which could result in patterns of comovement that differ
from comovement of returns observed during ordinary times. On the other hand, Acharya et al.
(2010) propose a measure that is closer to our “indirect vulnerability” IV(n). For each bank, they
estimate average returns during the 5% worst days of market conditions. They combine this estimate
with bank leverage to compute the “marginal expected shortfall (MES),” which captures how much
capital a bank must raise when faced with adverse market conditions. Finally, Billio, Getmansky,
Lo, and Pelizzon (2012) measure systemic risk using bilateral time-series dependencies between

14

firms. Diebold and Yilmaz (2011) discuss the relationship between cross-bank linkages estimated in
this way and measures of network connectedness. Our cross-bank indirect vulnerability measure
IV(n,m) can provide a structural foundation for some of these connections.
Our paper is also connected to a flourishing theoretical literature that studies linkages of
financial intermediaries (e.g. Eisenberg and Noe, 2001, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2011, Demange, 2011,
Gouriéroux, Héam and Montfort, 2012). The main differences between these papers and ours are (1)
our emphasis on deleveraging externalities (they focus on interbank contracts), and (2) the fact that
our model is easily calibratable (data on interbank lending are scarce, and often not public, and the
literature is mostly theoretical). 9 There are, however, a few important similarities. Our concept of
Indirect Vulnerability (IV(n)) is similar in spirit to network centrality (Ballester, Calvò-Armengol
and Zenou, 2006) which measures the extent to which a member of the network can easily be
reached by the others. In our model, a bank is connected to others if it owns a similar, exposed,
portfolio. Our concept of Systemicness (S(n)) is closer to the notion of “key player” (Ballester et al,
2006; Denbee, Julliard, Li and Yuan, 2012; see also the “threat index” in Demange, 2011). Overall,
another formal difference between these papers and ours is that they solve for the fixed point of the
equilibrium, while we focus on only the first round of deleveraging. Our framework could easily be
extended to such an analysis.
Last, our analysis is closely related to policy proposals recently put forth by Duffie (2011)
and Brunnermeier, Gorton, and Krishnamurthy (2011). Duffie (2011) proposes that a core group of
large financial firms report their losses vis-à-vis their largest counterparties for a list of stressful

different risk factors and scenarios. We build on this work by modeling these sensitivities, and
quantifying how these stress scenarios could play out across the broader financial sector.

IV. The Vulnerability of European Banks
In this Section, we use the model to investigate deleveraging spillovers among European
banks in the fall of 2011. As the US subprime crisis subsided in 2009, investor attention shifted to
the rapidly deteriorating fiscal position of a handful of European countries. Public deficits were large
and government debt in these countries seemed unsustainable. As the crisis unfolded between 2009
and 2011, one area of concern was the vast holdings of sovereign debt by banks. Widening sovereign
spreads had the potential of accelerating the deleveraging cycle of European banks. As we will see,
our model allows us to evaluate the importance of deleveraging externalities on systemic risk. It also
allows us to evaluate the quantitative impact of policies designed to contain the damage done by the
deleveraging cycle.
To calibrate our model, a crucial input is the matrix M of bank exposures. We use the data
European banks’ portfolios disseminated by the European Banking Authority in 2011. EBA data
allow us to calibrate our model, test it, and use it to do policy simulations. Given the role played by
sovereign debt, we focus on banks’ sovereign bond holdings, and consider as shocks writedowns of
Greek, Irish, Italian, Portugese, and Spanish debt (henceforth GIIPS debt).

A.

Data

Published on the EBA website in July 2011, the European stress tests provide harmonized
balance sheet composition for the 90 largest banks in the EU27 countries. The complete list of banks
is in Appendix B.

16

Matrix A 1 : The matrix of assets is obtained directly from the EBA data by taking, for each
bank, the sum of all exposures. Diagonal elements a nn are the “total exposure” in euros of bank n.
The average exposure is €260 billion. The biggest bank is HSBC (€1440bn), the smallest one is
Caixa d'Estalvis de Pollensa (€338 million).
Matrix M: To calculate the exposure matrix M, we collapse the EBA data into 42 asset
classes: sovereign debt of each of the 27 EU countries plus 10 others, commercial real estate,
mortgages, corporate loans, retail SME and retail revolving credit lines. The M matrix is thus a 90 x
42 matrix, where m nk is the fraction of exposure to asset k of bank m. Aggregate exposure to
commercial real estate across the 90 banks is €1.2 tn (5% of banking sector assets); small business
lending is €744 bn (3.2%); mortgages are €4.7 tn (20%); and corporate loans are €6.7 tn (29%).
Sovereign bonds account for €2.3 tn (13%).
An alternative way to compute M, which may be helpful in other applications, is to estimate
it from asset return data by regressing unlevered bank stock returns on the returns of assets in the
bank portfolio. Adopting this approach is reasonable if we believe the stock market fully recognizes
all of the assets and risks in a bank’s portfolio. And, the advantage of such an approach, particularly
visible in Acharya et al (2010), is that it allows researchers or policymakers to monitor M
dynamically. On the other hand, because factor returns are quite noisy and may be collinear, having
direct measures of M is clearly preferable wherever possible.
Matrix B: The leverage matrix B is the diagonal matrix of debt-to-equity ratio. We use book
leverage because the EU data does not lend itself to the use of market leverage (half of the 90 banks
are not listed, and EBA exposure data are mostly not marked-to-market), and because measures of
risk weighted leverage are strongly affected by regulatory arbitrage (Acharya, Schnabl and Suarez,
2011). To obtain each element b nn , we divide total exposure (the a nn element of A) minus book

17

equity by book equity. Because some EU banks are very levered, this number has a few outliers (540
for Allied Irish Banks, 228 for the Agricultural Bank of Greece). Because we do not want our results
to be driven by these outliers, we cap target leverage b nn at 30: this cap is imposed on 20 banks.
Matrix L: We assume L=10-13 x Id, where Id is a 42 x 42 diagonal matrix of ones. We
therefore assume that all 42 assets have the same price impact. 10-13 means that €10bn of trading
imbalances lead to a price change by 10bp. This is in the neighborhood of recent empirical estimates
of price impact in the bond market, but probably an underestimate for some other asset classes.
Shock F 1 : We study a 50% write-off of all GIIPS debt. Hence, the shock vector F 1 is equal
to zero for all 42 assets, except for the five GIIPS sovereign debts, for which we assume a return of 50%. Given banks’ exposures, the direct effect of this shock on aggregate bank equity is given by 1'A 1 MF 1 , which is equal to 381bn €, or 40.1% of aggregate bank equity. The shock we are feeding
to the system is thus very large.

B.

Validation using stock returns during the sovereign debt crisis

We first validate our deleveraging model using past data on bank returns during the crisis.
Between Dec 31, 2009 and September 16, 2011, European bank stocks (the subset of our sample
which is publicly traded) fell by an average of 54%. In this Section, we ask if this meltdown comes
from market perception of direct vulnerability DV(n) and indirect vulnerability IV(n) to losses on
GIIPS sovereign debt. If the market prices bank interdependence via deleveraging, IV(n) should
explain the cross-section of bank returns during the crisis, even controlling for DV(n).
To calculate DV(n) we use equation (10). To compute IV(n), we use a modified version of
equation (9), where we account for the fact that fire sales cannot exceed the total assets of a bank

18

(see Section II.A.). This adjustment is necessary as some banks are severely hit by the large shock
we assume, so as to entirely wipe out their equity. This leads to the following definition of IV(n):

IV ( n ) =

δ 'n A1MLM 'max ( BA1MF1 , A1 ( I − MF1 ) )
,
en

where max(X,Y) is the element-by-element max operator. In this definition, we plug in the above
matrices and the GIIPS shock vector F 1 .
Table 1 lists the top 10 banks, sorted according to IV(n). To see how IV(n) differs from
direct exposures, we also report direct vulnerability DV(n). Rankings in terms of indirect and direct
effect are far from being perfectly correlated: the Spearman rank correlation between DV and IV
with respect to a GIIPS shock is 0.17, and is not significantly different from 0 at the 5% level. On
average, the direct impact of a full-blown GIIPS crisis would be to wipe out 1.11 times the equity for
the average bank. To this direct effect, the impact of the subsequent deleveraging would further wipe
out some 302% of the equity of the average bank. As a reminder, all estimates of the impact of
deleveraging are contingent on our price impact factors L discussed earlier.
We then regress cumulative returns over 2010 and September 2011 of each bank on indirect
vulnerability, controlling for direct vulnerability, bank size (as measured by log of bank total
exposure log(a nn )) and leverage. These controls ensure that vulnerability to the deleveraging process
IV(n) adds explanatory power beyond a bank’s direct exposure. Table 2 shows these results.
The first three columns are simple OLS regressions. Out of 90 banks covered by the stress
tests, only 51 are publicly listed, and we have complete returns data for 49 of them. To reduce
sensitivity to outliers, we also report median regression results in columns 4-6. Both sets of results
confirm that the differences in indirect vulnerabilities explain part of the cross-section of bank
returns during the crisis. In OLS results, the R2 of indirect vulnerability alone is 9%, compared with
14% when direct exposure is also included. The bank size control does not affect the estimated
19

impact of IV(n) on returns. The direct and indirect vulnerabilities have the same explanatory power
on the cross-section of bank returns. For two banks that are one sample standard deviation apart in
terms of IV(n), cumulative returns drop by 5 percentage points more in the bank most exposed to
sector-wide deleveraging. Although the sample size is limited, Table 2 provides suggestive evidence
that the market was pricing indirect vulnerabilities of banks, and not only their direct exposures.

C.

Systemicness

In this Section, we briefly discuss the properties of our systemicness measure S(n) on
European Data. As for vulnerability, we need to amend equations (7) and (8) to ensure that banklevel total fire sales are less than total assets (see Section II.A).

S (n) =

1' A1MLM ' δ nδ 'n A1 max ( BMF1 , ( I − MF1 ) )
E1

a 
γ n  nn  × max ( bnnδ 'n MF1 ,1 − δ 'n MF1 ) .
=×
 E1 
which shows that the systemicness of bank n can be decomposed into the product of three scalars: γ n ,
which captures the impact of bank n on other banks through deleveraging, ann / E1, which captures
the relative size of bank n, and max(bnnδ 'n MF1,1 − δ 'n MF1 ), which reflects the size of fire sales by
bank n.
Table 3 reports the systemicness ranking for the 10 most systemic banks in Europe, along
with the three components of the decomposition above. Unsurprisingly, in the overall sample,
systemicness is correlated with size (spearman correlation of .52, statistically significant at 1%), but
this correlation is far from perfect, as can be seen among the 10 most systemic banks. For example,
HSBC, the largest EU bank, does not appear in this ranking. BNP Paribas, which is the second
largest, is only the fifth most systemic bank. Size does not explain everything because there is

20

substantial heterogeneity across banks in terms of necessary fire sales. Bankia, which is relatively
small, is among the most systemic banks because fire sales would be enormous (92% of its assets),
and it is highly connected with the rest of the financial system through its asset holdings (its linkage
component equals 0.42). Assuming, for instance, that Bankia had an average linkage level (0.30
instead of 0.42), its systemicness would be equal to 0.29x0.95x0.30=0.08, which would make it the
8th most systemic bank instead of the 6th.
The sum of systemicness across all 90 banks is equal to 2.45, which means that through the
deleveraging process, our model predicts that 245% of aggregate bank equity would be wiped out
(using the terminology of our model, AV = 2.45). This is sizeable, since the direct impact of the
GIIPS writedown is only 40.1% of EU bank equity. The deleveraging effect is therefore 6 times
larger than the direct shock. 10 In our following policy experiments, we focus on the deleveraging
effect.

D.

Policy simulations

We now use the model to evaluate a number of different policies that have the potential to
reduce deleveraging externalities. As a reminder, the model does not take a position on whether
banks are behaving optimally since it assumes an exogenous fire-sales rule for banks. Thus, the
interventions that follow should be interpreted as potential ex post interventions that could be used in
a moment of crisis. The results of the experiments are reported in Table 4.
Limiting Bank Size: We start by considering the effect of a cap on bank size, holding constant
leverage. We do this as follows. Suppose a bank n holds a n m nk euros of asset k. If assets a n >c, where
10

To properly calibrate this effect, we would need to amend our exercise in two directions: change the L matrix so as to
account for the fact that assets are less liquid, and change the liquidation rule of banks so as to account for the fact that
banks fire-sell liquid assets more. The first change would make estimates of systemic risk bigger, while the second one
(making banks smarter) would reduce it.

21

c is the cap, we set the bank’s assets to c, and redistribute residual asset holdings (a n – c)m nk equally
among non-capped banks. This procedure does not affect the portfolio structure of the capped bank,
but does affect the portfolios of the other banks, which become richer in the assets held by the
capped bank. After one iteration, some previously uncapped banks may end up with size greater than
c. We iterate this process until all banks are below or at the size cap.
In calculating the new AV, we keep leverage constant. This means we are implicitly assuming
that receiving banks can issue enough equity to absorb the new assets, while capped banks reduce
their equity when they downsize. The intention is to isolate the effect of size capping separately from
deleveraging, which we study in alternative experiments (see below).
We report the results of this experiment for caps of €500 bn, €900 bn and €1300 bn euro in
the first three rows of Table 4. The table shows that capping at €500 bn requires us to redistribute
assets out of 17 banks, while only two banks would be downsized if we set the cap to be €1300 bn.
The main lesson from this analysis is that the overall impact of size caps on aggregate vulnerability
is small, and, if anything, tends to increase AV.
The intuition for this can be understood by using the definition of AV and taking the
difference between before and after the policy has been implemented:

where ∆x measures the change in x between before and after the policy, and x measures the average
of x between before and after the policy. r n1 is the adjusted levered exposure given by

max(bnnδ 'n MF1,1 − δ 'n MF1 ) AV changes because the size cap reallocates assets across banks. The
.

22

overall effect can be decomposed into three pieces. First, there is a "size reallocation" effect, in
which AV is increased if assets are reallocated to banks that are more connected. Second is a
“connection reallocation” effect, in which AV increases when large, exposed/levered banks become
more connected. The third effect is “exposure reallocation”, which increases systemic risk if it
makes large connected banks more exposed.
We report this decomposition in Table 4, next to the size cap simulation. The net increase in
systemic risk is driven by two opposing forces. These two forces are the strongest for the most
drastic cap (€500 bn), so we focus on this one. On the one hand, average (size- and connectednessweighted) exposure decreases, which reduces systemic risk. This happens because large banks tend
to be significantly less exposed: GIIPS debt accounts for 3.2% of their assets, against 5.8% for banks
below €500 bn. 11 As a result, the average large banks has less GIIPS exposure: the transfer of one
euro from large to small banks will reduce the average exposure of smaller banks, while keeping the
average exposure of larger banks constant. Through this effect, the €500bn cap policy reduces
exposure at smaller banks by 10.5 percentage points, on average. This “risk dilution effect” (further
amplified by the fact that the smaller banks get relatively larger) decreases AV.
On the other hand, AV goes up because more exposed banks (which happen to be the smaller
banks) receive more assets. Through this “contamination effect”, safe assets which were previously
held by relatively sheltered institutions are now held by more exposed banks, increasing AV. Overall,
in the €500 bn cap policy, the contamination effect dominates the risk dilution effect.

GIIPS debt re-nationalization: We also look at the effect of reallocating GIIPS sovereign
debt to banks in their home country. This exercise is motivated by two facts. First, between July and
11

This difference also holds for levered exposure r. A 50% GIIPS debt write-down would wipe out 35% of the book
equity of large banks on average, against 46% for banks below the €500 bn threshold.

23

December 2011, under pressure of markets and regulators, GIIPS-based banks increased their
holdings of GIIPS debt by about 1%, while non GIIPS-based banks reduced them by about 22%.
Second, between December 2011 and January 2012, while the ECB lent about €500 bn to euro-area
banks, Spanish banks bought about 23bn euro of government debt and Italian banks some €20 bn. A
partially intended consequence of prudential and monetary policies over the fall of 2011 has thus
been to re-nationalize GIIPS debt.
We thus implement the reallocation of 20% of aggregate holdings of each sovereign back to
the balance sheets of banks of its own country. First, for each sovereign k, we aggregate euro
holdings by all banks according to sk = ∑ mnk an . For each bank n outside country k, we then remove
n

20% × sk ×

∑a

euro of sovereign k from its balance sheet. Then, for each domestic bank n'

in country k, we inject the holdings in proportion of its holdings of the sovereign among banks of
country k: 20% × sk ×

an' mn' k

∑a

m m mk

. This reallocation never leads to negative holdings as long as

m∈domestic

foreign banks own at least 20% of the aggregate holdings of sovereign k, which is the case in our
simulation. 12
Table 4 reports the results of this simulation. We find that it reduces systemic risk by about
8%, an effect larger than the €500 bn size cap. This effect is large: the amount of sovereign debt
reallocated in the process is only €96 bn, while the €500 bn size cap reallocates trillion of euro of
assets.

12

The only country in our sample where domestic banks own more than 80% of the aggregate bank holdings is the UK
(81.6%).

24

What drives this surprising reduction in AV? As in equation (13), we can break down the
overall impact into three components. Most of the effect comes through the aggregate reduction in
exposure. When reallocating GIIPS debt, we are reducing GIIPS exposure of non-GIIPS banks (on
average, by 0.2% of total assets), while increasing the exposure of most GIIPS banks (on average, by
some 0.03% of their total assets). 13 Given that GIIPS banks, in our data, are on average less levered
than non-GIIPS banks (with a debt-to-equity ratio of 21 against 23), this implements an overall
reduction in fire sales and hence AV.

Euro-bonds: Our next intervention replicates the effect of substituting all the different
sovereign bonds in Europe for one debt security that has the same aggregate payoff. The intuition
behind the experiment is to break the loop between banks and their sovereigns (Acharya, Dreschler
and Schnabl, 2010). Many recent proposals in Europe have suggested replacing part of individual
sovereign bonds in the eurozone with the equivalent amount of a euro-level sovereign bond.
According to these proposals, a key advantage would be to make banks less sensitive to their own
sovereign default.
Suppose we could substitute the sovereign portfolio of each bank with a new portfolio of
sovereigns (1) which has the same size and (2) whose weights are the same across banks. To
implement this, we change the exposure m nk into sharesov k × %sov n where sharesov k is the share of
sovereign k in aggregate sovereign holdings, while %sov n is the share of sovereign holdings in bank
n's portfolio. This reshuffling of bonds across banks preserves each bank’s total sovereign exposure,
and aggregate bank holdings of each sovereign. But it makes banks more similar in terms of

13

Some GIIPS banks experience a decrease in exposure. This happens because these banks own a lot of GIIPS debt but
relatively little of their own sovereign (for instance most Italian banks own much a lot of non-Italian debt, and relatively
less Italian debt). As a result, the policy reduces overall exposure to GIIPS for these banks.

25

individual country exposure. In the context of our model, it is as if all banks were holding
Eurobonds.
Table 4 shows that this policy involves a considerable reshuffling of assets across banks:
some 1.6tn euro of bonds change owners. It also increases AV. As in the previous experiment, the
reason is that exposure to distressed sovereigns is reallocated to banks that are more levered, so that
only the “exposure change” components appears. The intuition is that non-GIIPS banks are both less
exposed but more levered in the data. The eurobond experiment transfers GIIPS debt from GIIPS
banks to non-GIIPS banks, and therefore increases exposure of the most levered banks.

Ring-fencing risky assets: Perhaps more targeted policies can make the most systemic banks
safer? To understand the effect of a merger, let us assume that banks indexed by n are merged
together into a bank denoted by *. Noting that the merger preserves the quantity of each holding, it is
straightforward to show that (see Appendix A for a formal proof):
=
∆AV

am
γ m ( b*r * − bm rm ).
E
m merged

∑

(14)

The interpretation of equation (14) is simple: if banks that are larger or more connected have a
levered exposure b m r m lower than the merged entity b*r*, then the merger increases systemic risk.
The intuition is that the merger creates contagion: banks that are relatively large and connected, but
less exposed, are protected against the shock. By being merged into an entity with larger exposure,
these assets become vulnerable to fire sales, increasing AV.
Suppose now that the regulator merges the most exposed banks into a single large bank. For
each bank, we define as ‘exposure’ the fraction of bank equity that would be lost directly in a 50%
write-down of GIIPS debt. We then study three scenarios: merge all banks with exposure above

26

50%, above 100% and above 150% of their own equity. This means merging respectively 47, 20 and
9 banks.
Table 4 shows that the effect of the bank mergers is nearly zero. The reason is that the
policy regroups banks that have very similar levered exposure b m r m . And, as equation (14)
demonstrates, the expected change in AV is small when expected leverage adjusted-exposure r n1 is
the same across merged firms. In this case, ring-fencing does not reduce systemic risk: the policy
simply transforms several similar small banks into one big bank with the same exposure.

Merging exposed banks with unexposed ones: Suppose we merge the 20 most exposed banks
with the banks that are unexposed to the GIIPS write-down (6 of the 90 banks are unexposed). To
isolate the impact of merging the two groups, we first merge the exposed banks together, then merge
the unexposed banks together, and then finally perform the full merger. Merging unexposed banks
does not change AV, because of the effect discussed in the previous experiment: they are identical
with respect to the shock. For the same reason, merging exposed banks does not change things much
either. Merging the two groups into one bank does, however, increase systemic risk by 20% of
aggregate equity. The intuition is that the assets of unexposed banks, which were previously not sold
in response to the shock, become contaminated by the poor performance of GIIPS debt.

Leverage cap: We next study the impact of capping leverage. Here, the policy is much
simpler: if x is the cap, then, for all banks with leverage above x, we set D/E =x. We implicitly
assume these banks can raise equity to reach the maximum leverage, but do not change their sizes.
Economically in our model, such a policy reduces the need for banks to fire-sell assets, so it
unambiguously reduces AV. From Equation (6) we see that:

27

The policy is more effective when targeted banks are either (1) bigger, (2) more exposed, or (3) hold
large asset classes.
We try three different caps (knowing we capped leverage to 30 in the data): 15, 20 and 25.
We calculate the amount of equity capped banks need to raise to reach this cap: for instance capping
leverage at 15 (25th percentile) requires banks to raise a staggering of €480 bn. The table shows that,
to obtain a significant reduction in systemic risk, the regulator would need to set a very drastic cap.
For instance, capping leverage at 25 (this is leverage at the 63rd percentile bank) only reduces
vulnerability to a GIIPS shock from 245 to 238% of aggregate equity. The impact of reducing
leverage to 20 is much larger.

E.

Optimizing capital injection

This Section investigates the injection of capital that optimizes the reduction in Aggregate
Vulnerability AV. We have seen in the previous Section that capping leverage is the only policy that
delivers sizeable reductions in AV. The cost of this policy is large (approximately €480bn) and the
action quite drastic, since it recapitalizes all banks with leverage above 15. This Section looks at the
"optimal" capital injection. The idea is to potentially identify banks are either less connected (their
portfolio differs from other banks) or smaller, so that recapitalizing them may be less necessary, in
which case the recapitalization can be done at lower cost.
Suppose the regulator has a given amount of cash F available to invest in bank equity, and
cares only about reducing spillovers between banks in a deleveraging cycle. Equity injection into

28

bank n is given by the vector f = (f 1 ,…,f n ), so that 1′ f = F . When a bank receives f n euros of fresh
equity, we assume the entire amount is used to repay existing debt, so that its debt to equity ratio
becomes (D i – f i )/(E i + f i ).
We minimize Eq. (8) subject to the constraints that 1′ f = F and (D i – f i )/(E i + f i )=b i ?. We
also impose the constraint that the regulator cannot withdraw cash from equity-rich banks, so that
f n >0 for all i.
Optimizing equity injection across banks allows us to reduce aggregate vulnerability in a
more cost-effective way than any of the policy experiments we previously considered. We report in
the last panel of Table 4 the reduction in AV obtained through the optimal injection of €200bn: AV
decreases by .26, which is much bigger than any other policy except the leverage cap at 15, which
costs €480bn. In our model, there are therefore large gains to optimize.
We then seek to characterize the optimal recapitalization that comes from the model. Table
5 then reports the optimal equity injections for each bank. We only report the 20 largest banks,
ranked by the size of their equity injection. This list consists mostly of Italian, Spanish and Greek
banks.
By construction, optimal injection has a very strong correlation with systemicness (.91).
Correlation with the four components of systemicness is lower: .16 (leverage), .16 (Size), 38 (direct
exposure), .21 (linkage). This shows that when deciding to inject fresh capital into banks, the
regulator should consider all components of systemicness to minimize taxpayers’ investment.

F.

Extension-- considering different liquidation rules

29

Earlier we suggested that the model could be adjusted for different liquidation rules. A
natural one to consider is one in which banks first sell off their most liquid assets. Here we focus on
an extreme case and show its impact on the empirical results.
Suppose that banks have the flexibility to sell their sovereign bonds, but that their other
assets (primarily loans) are infinitely illiquid, meaning that their early disposal would yield zero
proceeds. In this case, the banks would have to concentrate their liquidations of sovereign bonds
alone. In this case, we can write down a modified version of the formula for aggregate vulnerability
AV to a shock S:

1′ At −1MLM *′ M ′BAt −1MS
AV =
,
Et −1

(15)

where M* is a weight matrix that accounts for the fact that non-sovereigns are not liquidated. Each
element is given by: mik* = mik /

( ∑ m ) . We only focus on factors k which corresponds to sovereign
k

ik

holdings. Hence, elements of M* are bigger: banks will liquidate more sovereigns in response to an
adverse shock to their balance sheets.
A striking feature of these simulations is that aggregate vulnerability is much lower under
this alternative liquidation rule. The aggregate vulnerability of banks to a GIIPS write-down is now
23%, instead of 285%. This is because changing the liquidation rule has two opposite effects. On
the one hand, banks liquidate much more sovereign bonds, which has a stronger price impact on
other banks. On the other hand, fire sales don’t contaminate other assets, which in this case are the
majority of assets held on bank balance sheets.
Table 6 reports values of AV for alternative liquidation rules. We progressively add other
asset classes to the list of liquid assets. As can be seen from Table 6, as long as the list of liquid
assets is small enough (i.e. corresponds to less than 41% of bank assets), aggregate vulnerability is

30

reduced by illiquidity of the other assets. The intuition is that illiquidity prevents banks from
transmitting their shocks to otherwise immune banks. When, however, sellable assets take up a
larger fraction of the balance sheet (in our simulations, this happens as soon as we include corporate
loans), then the fire sale concentration effect starts dominating the “ring fencing” effect: because
banks cannot liquidate everything, they sell more liquid assets, which increases the price impact and
therefore contagion. Table 6 illustrates the ambiguity of alternative liquidation rules on AV.

V. Dynamic Estimation of Vulnerability and Systemicness
In our analysis thus far, we have used data on bank holdings and leverage to compute the M
and B matrices, which are the key inputs in our calculations of vulnerability and systemicness. This
approach has the advantage of precision: we can study how shocks may propagate across many
different types of assets on bank balance sheets. The main disadvantage is that it requires granular
data that may not always be available, or data that is only available to regulators.
An alternative approach is to compute M using stock returns. Consider the M matrix, which
captures banks’ ownership of different asset classes such as mortgages, sovereign debt, or securities.
We can estimate exposures to these assets by regressing unlevered stock returns on the underlying
returns of the factors. For each bank n, we can run rolling regressions of the form:
=
Rn ,t

∑m

nk

Fkt + ε n ,t

(16)

k

Provided we have the full vector of asset returns F k,t , the estimated m nk is equal to the weight of each
asset in the bank’s portfolio. Armed with a conditional estimate of M, we can compute systemicness
and vulnerability on a dynamic basis, which is potentially valuable from the perspective of
monitoring. Note that R nt has to be obtained through unlevering the equity returns, since the M is the
matrix of asset exposures.

31

When we estimate the M matrix with returns, we implicitly assume that: (1) we have the
adequate set of factor returns to represent each bank's portfolio, (2) that holdings are fairly stable
(i.e. did not move too much over the span of the data used to estimate the regression), and (3) that
the stock market has some understanding of each bank's exposure to each asset. Similar marketbased approaches are adopted by many of the recent efforts to monitor systemic risk, including
Adrian and Brunnermeier (2010) and Acharya et al (2010). A challenge for regressions of this type
is the lack of power when bank assets have correlated returns. For example, suppose one wanted to
estimate a bank’s exposures to Italian and Spanish bonds. Since the returns of these bonds are highly
correlated, one requires long time-series of data to obtain reliable estimates. But, the longer is the
time-series, the more likely the estimate of M is to be stale.

VI. Conclusions
Since the beginning of the US financial crisis in 2007, regulators in the United States and
Europe have been frustrated by the difficulty in identifying the risk exposures at the largest and most
levered financial institutions. Yet, at the time, it was unclear how such data might have been used to
make the financial system safer. Our paper is an attempt to show simple ways in which this
information can be used to understand how deleveraging scenarios could play out.
The key assumption in our model is that distressed banks use asset liquidations to return to
target leverage. We use this assumption to predict how individual banks will behave following
shocks to their net worth, and how the resulting fire sales may spillover to other banks. While the
model is quite stylized, it generates a number of useful insights concerning the distribution of risks
in the financial sector. For example, the model suggests that regulators should pay close attention to
risks that are concentrated in the most levered banks. The model also suggests that policies which

32

explicitly target bank solvency, such as was implicit in both the European and US stress tests, may
be suboptimal from the perspective of controlling contagion.
We then apply the model to the largest financial institutions in Europe, focusing on banks’
exposure to sovereign bonds. We use the model to evaluate a number of policy proposals to reduce
systemic risk. When analyzing the European banks in 2011, we show how a policy of targeted equity
injections, if distributed appropriately across the most systemic banks, can significantly reduce
systemic risk.

Table 1. Vulnerability to a 50% write-off on all GIIPS Debt. We compute the vulnerability of the major
European banks to a 50% write-down on all sovereign debt of Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. In column
1, IV(n) denotes the indirect vulnerability via sector-wide deleveraging as we define it in Equation (10), adjusted for
the fact that total fire sales are capped by total assets (see Section II.A.). In column 3, DV(n) denotes the direct
vulnerability to the write-down on balance-sheets, as defined in Equation (9), adjusted for maximal fire sales. Both
measures are normalized by bank equity. In the last line of the table, we also report sample averages: Hence, a 50%
write-down on all GIIPS debt would wipe out 111% of the equity of the average bank through the direct impact,
while the indirect impact via deleveraging would create an additional loss of 302% of equity.

Table 3. Systemicness Ranking in Response to a GIIPS shock. We calculate the systemicness S(n) of each
individual bank, assuming a 50% write-off on GIIPS sovereign debt. Column 1 reports systemicness as computed in
equation (7). We only report detailed information for the top 10 banks in terms of systemicness. Columns 2, 3, and
4 report the elements of the decomposition of systemicness from equation (8), except that we take into account the
fact that fire sales induced by the write-off are capped by total assets (see Section II.A.). Column 2 reports total
exposure of each bank, normalised by aggregate equity. Column 3 reports the fraction of assets that would be firesold as a fraction of total exposure. Because of our cap, it is always smaller than 1. Column 4 focuses on the linkage
effect. By virtue of equation (8), systemicness is the product of the elements in columns 2,3 and 4. Banks are sorted
by systemicness. Through Santander, a GIIPS write-off would lead, through deleveraging, to a 21% reduction in
aggregate bank equity. The last line present the aggregate sum (over the 90 banks) of systemicness, which is equal to
Aggregate Vulnerability (equation (5)). A 50% write-down on GIIPS debt would wipe out, through deleveraging
245% of total bank equity.

Table 6: Robustness to Liquidation Rules. We calculate the aggregate vulnerability AV to a 50% writedown of
GIIPS debt. In line 1, we report the baseline AV. In line 2, we assume only sovereigns can be sold. In line 3, we
assume sovereigns and commercial real estate only can be sold. In line 4, we add mortgages to the list of assets that
can be sold. In line 7, we include all known assets (typically about 80 % of total exposure). The difference here with
the first line is that we assume banks have no cash to adjust.

Appendix A: The Systemic Impact of Bank Mergers
We prove below that when some banks have similar leverage and similar asset mix, merging
them has no impact on aggregate AV. Equivalently, dividing a bank into several banks having the
same levels of leverage and the same asset mix has no impact on AV.
Assume there are N+s-1 banks and that the last s banks all have same leverage 𝑏𝑁 and same

portfolio weights 𝑚𝑛,𝑘 . Since they have the same mix of assets, they also have same asset returns 𝑟𝑁
Developing the formula in equation (6) yields:
𝐴𝑉 × 𝐸1 =
𝐴𝑉 × 𝐸1 =

�

�

𝑛∈[1,𝑁+𝑠] 𝑘∈[1,𝐾] 𝑚∈[1,𝑁+𝑠]

𝑎𝑚 �

𝑎𝑛 � 𝑟𝑁

This expression is strictly identical to the AV of a system where the first N-1 banks are similar to the
previous system (𝑎�𝑚 = 𝑎𝑚 ; 𝑚 ∈ [1, 𝑁 − 1] ) and the last one, bank N, is the combination of the

previous last s banks: �𝑎�𝑁 = ∑𝑛∈[𝑁,𝑁+𝑠] 𝑎𝑛 ; 𝑏�𝑁 = 𝑏𝑁 ; 𝑚
� 𝑁,𝑘 = 𝑚𝑁,𝑘 �.
