The Forgotten History of Domestic Debt
Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff
NBER Working Paper No. 13946
April 2008
JEL No. E6,F3,N0
ABSTRACT
There is a rich scholarly literature on sovereign default on external debt. Comparatively little is known
about sovereign defaults on domestic debt. Even today, cross-country data on domestic public debt
remains curiously exotic, particularly prior to the 1980s. We have filled this gap in the literature by
compiling a database on central government public debt (external and domestic). The data span 1914
to 2007 for most countries, reaching back into the nineteenth century for many. Our findings on debt
sustainability, sovereign defaults, the temptation to inflate, and the hierarchy of creditors only scratch
the surface of what the domestic public debt data can reveal. First, domestic debt is big -- for the 64
countries for which we have long time series, domestic debt accounts for almost two-thirds of total
public debt. For most of the sample, this debt carries a market interest rate (except for the financial
repression era between WWII and financial liberalization). Second, the data go a long ways toward
explaining the puzzle of why countries so often default on their external debts at seemingly low debt
thresholds. Third, domestic debt has largely been ignored in the vast empirical work on inflation. In
fact, domestic debt (a significant portion of which is long term and non-indexed) is often much larger
than the monetary base in the run-up to high inflation episodes. Last, the widely-held view that domestic
residents are strictly junior to external creditors does not find broad support.

I. Introduction
This paper is as much an exercise in archeology as in economics. We have
unearthed a vast trove of historical time-series data on domestic public debt for 64
countries ranging back to 1914. Our key sources are publications of the now-defunct
League of Nations, including updates until the early 1980s by its successor, the United
Nations. We also make use of national sources and work by scholars to supplement,
cross-check and extend the data, both back before 1914 for some countries plus forward
to the present for most. Although it may come as quite a surprise to most readers that
historical time series on domestic debt should be exotic for so many countries, it is. This
is in contrast to external sovereign debt, on which there is a vast literature.1 We are not
aware of any academic or policy study that uses similar data, certainly not one
encompassing such a long time period and so many countries.
Indeed, historical data on domestic (internal) government debt has been ignored
for so long that many observers have come to believe that the issuance boom of the early
2000s is something entirely new and different.2 This perspective is based on the belief
that, historically, domestic government debt played only a minor role in the public
finances of most developing and post-conflict countries.3 The new data set thoroughly
dispels this notion. Our key findings can be summarized as follow:

1

Domestic public debt is issued under home legal jurisdiction. In most countries, over most of their
history, it has been denominated in the local currency and held mainly by residents. By the same token, the
overwhelming majority of external public debt—debt under the legal jurisdiction of foreign governments—
has been denominated in foreign currency and held by foreign residents. Theoretical models that try to
explain default include Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) and Bulow and Rogoff (1989). Empirical studies of
external debt that range from in-depth case studies (such as the classics by Winkler, 1928, or Wynne, 1951)
to systematic cross-country analysis (Bordo and Eichengreen, 1999, Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer, 2006
and Tomz, 2007). Eichengreen (1991) provides an authoritative summary of the early literature.

First, domestic debt is large—for the 64 countries for which we have long time
series, domestic debt averages almost two-thirds of total public debt; for most of the
sample these debts typically carried a market interest rate, except for the era of financial
repression after World War II. Second, recognizing the significance of domestic debt
goes a long way toward explaining the puzzle of why many countries default on (or
restructure) their external debts at seemingly low debt thresholds. In fact, when
heretofore ignored domestic debt obligations are taken into account, fiscal duress at the
time of default is often revealed to be quite severe.4 A third and related point is that
domestic debt may also explain the paradox of why some governments seem to choose
inflation rates far above any level that might be rationalized by seignorage revenues
leveraged off the monetary base (e.g., as in Cagan’s classic, 1956, article on postwar
hyperinflations). Although domestic debt is largely ignored in the vast empirical
literature on high and hyperinflation, we find that there are many cases where the hidden
overhang of domestic public debt was at least the same order of magnitude as base
money, and sometimes a large multiple.5
Last, our paper offers a first attempt to catalogue episodes of overt default on and
rescheduling of domestic public debt across more than a century. This phenomenon
appears to be somewhat rarer than external default, but far too common to justify the
extreme assumption that governments always honor the nominal face value of domestic
debt. When overt default on domestic debt does occur, it appears to occur under

This puzzling “debt intolerance” is examined by Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003).
See Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) for an excellent treatise on this subject (and the classic papers that
are cited therein). A few theoretical treatments (for example Calvo, 1989) have recognized the potential
significance of nominal domestic debt. Yet, since many researchers have long believed domestic debt to be
relatively small and unimportant, the incentives to inflate it away have received scant attention in the
empirical literature.

situations of greater duress than for pure external defaults—both in terms of an implosion
of output and marked escalation of inflation. It is important to note that we do not here
catalogue episodes of major de facto partial defaults, say through a sharp unexpected
increase in financial repression (e.g., of the type India and China still impose today).
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Since our new public debt database is
central to our analysis, we begin by describing some of its key features. Specifically, we
focus on four broad areas: the composition of public debt (domestic versus external); the
structure of domestic debt by maturity; the interest rates on domestic and external debt;
and, lastly, what little is known of its currency composition. Further details are discussed
in the Appendices.
Section III introduces our approach to cataloguing defaults on domestic public
debt. Such defaults typically leave few footprints in the mainstream international or
business press and are therefore much more difficult to detect than external defaults
(which our database comprehensively catalogues). In section IV, we look at the
potential role of domestic debt during episodes of external default. Section V explores the
connection between high inflation and domestic debt in emerging markets and postconflict countries. Section VI attempts to shed light on the issue of who gets heavily
defaulted on more often, domestic or foreign residents.
In our conclusion, we raise the question of whether the difficulties in unearthing
domestic public debt data should be addressed by an international agency that coordinates
greater transparency across sovereign debt issuers. The League of Nations once enforced
such reporting, although the results were under-publicized and subsequently forgotten.
Should not today’s multilateral lending institutions, such as the International Monetary

3

Fund and the World Bank, be able to do the same today, if not better? The IMF’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) takes a step in that direction but only the most
recent figures appear and debt categories vary substantially by country. Absent a
borrowing history, it is impossible to conduct any meaningful credit analysis.
II. Domestic Public Debt: Some Features
Unquestionably, the single most remarkable feature of our cross-country data set
is its apparent uniqueness. Until now, obtaining comprehensive long-term time series on
domestic debt has been extremely difficult for most countries. Even for the relatively
rich countries, the OECD database only goes back to 1980, and constructing long-term
time series from national sources is far less straightforward than one might imagine.
Outside the OECD countries, the dearth of data is stunning.
Only recently, a few groups of scholars have begun constructing data for the
contemporary period. Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) draw on national sources to
develop a data set for selected developing countries and emerging markets covering the
years 1990 to 2002. More recently, Jeanne and Guscina (2006) provide detailed data on
domestic debt for nineteen important emerging markets for 1980 to 2005. Cowan, LevyYeyati, Panizza and Sturzenegger (2006) provide data for all the countries in the Western
Hemisphere from 1980 (or 1990) to 2004.6
Figure 1 plots the share of domestic debt in total public debt for 1900 to 2006,
which averaged between 40 and 80 percent of total debt. See data appendix for data
availability by country. The figures in this chart are simple averages across countries,
but these ratios are also fairly representative for many of the emerging markets in the

variables, including external debt, that we also draw upon here.

sample (including now-rich countries when they were still emerging markets, such as
Greece, Austria, and Spain).7 As the figure underscores, the data set here contains
significant representation from every continent, not just for a handful of Latin American
and European countries, as in most of the external debt literature.
Of course, the experience is diverse. For advanced economies, domestic debt
accounts for the lion’s share of public-sector liabilities. At the other extreme, in some
emerging markets, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, domestic debt markets were dealt a
brutal blow by many governments’ propensity to inflate—or hyperinflate. For instance, in
the years following the hyperinflation of 1989 to 1990, domestic debt only accounted for
10 to 20 percent of Peru’s public debt. Yet, this was not always so. As with many other
countries in Latin America, the early (end of World War I) entries of the League of
Nations data show that Peru’s domestic debt then accounted for about two-thirds of
public-sector debt. Indeed, the share was even higher in the 1950s, when the world’s
financial centers were not engaged in much external lending.
In addition to showing that the debt is large, the data also dispel the belief that
until recently, emerging markets (and developing countries) had never been able to
borrow long term. As Figure 2 shows, long-term debt constitutes a large share of the
total debt stock over a significant part of the sample, at least for the period 1914 to 1959.
(Over this sub-period, the League of Nations/UN database provides considerable detail
on maturity structure.) It may come as a surprise to many readers (as it did to these
authors) that modern bias towards short-term debt is a relatively recent phenomenon,
evidently a product of the “inflation fatigue” of the 1970s and 1980s.
7

Domestic public debt has never amounted to much in a few Latin American countries (Uruguay
stands out in this regard), and public debt markets are virtually nonexistent in the CFA African countries
(which originally were the Colonies françaises d'Afrique).

Nor is the fact that many emerging markets are now paying market-oriented
interest rates on domestic debt new. Of course, during the post–World War II era, many
governments did repress domestic financial markets, with low deposit rate ceilings and
high bank reserve requirements, among other devices. But in fact, interest rate data for
the first half of the twentieth century shows that financial repression was neither so strong
nor so universal. As Table 1 shows for the years 1928–1946, the period over which we
have the best documentation, interest rates on domestic and external debt issues were
relatively similar, supporting the notion that the debt was market determined.
A final issue is inflation or foreign currency indexation. Until very recently, most
observers held that domestic public debt was mostly non-indexed local currency
obligations. Most externally issued emerging market public debt was similarly viewed as

It should also be noted that until the past ten to fifteen years, most countries’ external debt was largely
public debt. Private external borrowing has become more significant only over the past couple decades;

major innovation. In reality, Argentina issued domestic government bonds in the late
1800s that were denominated in pound sterling, and Thailand issued dollar-linked
domestic debt in the 1960s (See Appendix Table 4 for sources).9
We summarize by noting that for most countries over most of history (notably
including emerging markets), domestic debt has been large and highly significant.
Nothing about the maturity structure or interest rates paid on these debts lends
justification to the common practice of ignoring them in calculations of debt
sustainability or inflation stability.
We acknowledge that our data set has important limitations. First, the data
generally cover only central government debt. Of course, it would be desirable to have
long time series on consolidated government debt, including state and local debt and
guaranteed debt for quasi-public agencies. Furthermore, many central banks across the
world issue debt on their own, often to sterilize foreign exchange intervention (See
Calvo, 1991, on these “perilous” practices). Adding such data, of course, would only
expand the perception of how important domestic public debt has been.
We now take up some important potential applications of this data.
III.

Cataloguing Defaults on Domestic Public Debt

Theoretical models contain a wide range of assumptions about domestic public
debt. The overwhelming majority of models simply assume that debt is always honored.
These include models where deficit policy is irrelevant due to Ricardian equivalence
(Barro, 1976), where domestic public debt is a key input in price-level determination
through the government’s budget constraint (Woodford, 1995), and where generations

9

Of course, during the early years of the interim war period, many countries pegged their currencies to gold
(See Appendix Table 3).

9

overlap (Diamond, 1965). There is a small literature that aims to understand why
governments honor domestic debt at all (e.g., Persson and Tabellini, 2000, or Kotlikoff,
Persson, and Svensson, 1988). However, the general assumption throughout the
literature is, whereas governments may inflate away debt, outright defaults on domestic
public debt are extremely rare. This is in stark contrast to the literature on external public
debt, where the government’s incentive to default is one of the main focuses of inquiry.
In fact, our reading of the historical record is that overt de jure defaults on
domestic public debt, while less common than external defaults, are hardly rare. Our data
set includes 68 cases of overt default (compared to 250 post-1800 external debt defaults).
These de jure defaults took place via a potpourri of mechanisms, ranging from forcible
conversions, to lower coupon rates, to unilateral reduction of principal (sometimes in
conjunction with a currency conversion), to suspensions of payments. Appendix Table 3
lists these episodes.
As we have already emphasized, our catalogue of domestic defaults is almost
certainly a lower bound, as domestic defaults are far more difficult to detect than defaults
on international debt. Even the widespread defaults on domestic debt during the 1930s
Great Depression in both advanced and developing economies are not well documented.
As a more recent example, consider Argentina. Between 1980 and 2001, Argentina
defaulted three times on its domestic debt. The two defaults that coincided with defaults
in external debt (1982 and 2001) did attract considerable international attention.
However, the large-scale 1989 default, which did not involve a new default on external
debt, is scarcely known outside Argentina.

10

Why would a government refuse to pay its domestic public debt in full when it
can simply inflate the problem away? One answer, of course, is that inflation causes
distortions, especially to the banking system and the financial sector. Sometimes, the
government may view repudiation as the lesser evil. The potential costs of inflation are
especially problematic when the debt is relatively short term or indexed, since the
government then has to inflate much more aggressively to achieve a significant real
reduction in debt service payments. In other cases, such as the United States during the
Great Depression, default (by abrogation of the gold clause in 1933) was a precondition
for reinflating the economy through expansionary fiscal and monetary policy.
Of course, there are other forms of de facto default (besides inflation). The
combination of heightened financial repression with rises in inflation was an especially
popular form of default from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Brock (1989) makes the point
that inflation and reserve requirements are positively correlated, particularly in Africa and
Latin America.10 Interest rate ceilings combined with inflation spurts are also common.
For example, during the 1972–1976 external debt rescheduling in India, interest rates
(interbank) in India were 6.6 and 13.5 percent in 1973 and 1974, while inflation spurted
to 21.2 and 26.6 percent. These episodes of de facto default through financial repression
are not listed among our de jure credit-event dating. Only to the extent that inflation
exceeds the 20 percent threshold we use to define an inflation crisis, do they count at
all.11

10

Average reserve requirements for developing countries in his 1960 to early 1980s sample ran at about
0.25, more than three times the average for advanced economies.
11
Another subtle type of default is illustrated by the Argentine government’s treatment of its inflationindexed debt in 2007. Most impartial observers agree that Argentina’s official inflation rate considerably
understates actual inflation because of government manipulation. This represents a partial default on index-

11

Clearly, the assumption embedded in many theoretical models that governments
always honor the nominal face value of debt is a significant overstatement, particularly
for emerging markets past and present. Nevertheless, we would also caution against
reaching the opposite extreme conclusion, that governments can ignore powerful
domestic stakeholders and simply default at will (de jure or de facto) on domestic debt.
We will now proceed to explore some implications of the overhang of large domestic
debt on external default and inflation.
IV. Domestic Debt and External Default: The Missing Link
We begin by revisiting the conventional wisdom on external debt default and its
implications for debt sustainability exercises and debt default thresholds. Indeed, in the
250 external debt default episodes in our database, it is clear that domestic debt loomed
large across the vast majority of them. Table 2 gives the ratio of both external debt and
total debt (including domestic and external liabilities) relative to government revenues on
the eve of many of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries’ most notable defaults. We
normalize debt by government revenues because data on nominal GDP is sketchy or
nonexistent for the nineteenth-century default episodes. (For many countries, standard
sources such as Maddison, 2004, do not provide anything close to a continuous time
series for GDP for the nineteenth century.) Exports, which usually have longer time
series, are not the obvious benchmark once domestic debt is added to the calculus of debt
sustainability.

linked debt by any reasonable measure, and it affects a large number of bondholders. Yet, Argentina’s de
facto domestic bond default has not registered heavily in the external press or with rating agencies.

Looking more broadly at our the sample, Figure 4 is based on the 89 episodes of
external default over the period 1827 to 2003 where we have full data on external debt,
total debt, and revenues. In all regions except Latin America, external debt accounts for
less than half of total debt during the year a country defaults on external debt; for Latin
America, the average ratio is higher, but still only 60 percent.
Thus, uncovering data on domestic debt suggests at least a partial answer to one
of the most basic puzzles in the entire literature on international debt, emphasized by
Bulow and Rogoff (1987) among others: Why do emerging market governments tend to
default at such stunningly low levels of debt repayments and debts to GDP? Reinhart,
Rogoff and Savastano (2003), for example, present evidence that “serial defaulters” tend
to default at ratios of debt to GDP that are below the euro area’s “Maastricht Treaty”
upper bound of 60 percent. In fact, taking into account domestic public debt, the anomaly
largely disappears.

Figure 4 gives a different perspective on the data by providing the frequency
distribution of external debt to GDP and total debt to GDP across all the external debt
episodes in our sample for which we have full data. As the figure illustrates, external
debt to government revenue ratios are massed at a much smaller average than total debt
to government revenue ratios during the year of an external default, with a mean of 2.38
versus 4.21. This order-of-magnitude difference is consistent across individual episodes
(as Table 2 above highlights for some well-known cases). It is also consistent across
regions (Figure 4) and time.

14

Obviously, if domestic debt were trivial, then the frequency distribution of the
total debt ratio at the time of default should overlap that of domestic debt. This is hardly
the case, and a standard battery of tests rejects this hypothesis across the board.12

Finally, we note that domestic debt is not static around default episodes. In fact,
domestic debt often shows the same frenzied increases in the run-up to external default as
foreign borrowing does. The pattern is illustrated in Figure 5, which depicts debt
accumulation during the five years up to and including external default across all the
episodes in our sample.
Presumably, the comovement of domestic and foreign debt is produced by the
same procyclical behavior of fiscal policy documented by previous researchers.13 As
shown repeatedly over time, emerging market governments are prone to treating

For example, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test rejects the hypothesis that the two frequency distributions

behavior of the current account can be rationalized by the high ratio of permanent to transitory shocks in
emerging markets.

Domestic debt often builds up in the aftermath of external defaults. The case of
pre-communist China is a caricature of the typical post-default trajectory. China’s
government depended almost exclusively on external debt until two major defaults in
1921 and 1939, with public domestic debt exploding in the aftermath of both incidents.
By the mid-1940s, China’s government relied almost exclusively on domestic debt.

14

Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) argue that there are strong parallels between today’s emerging markets and
the behavior of today’s rich countries when they were at the same stage of development.

16

V. Domestic Debt in High-Inflation Episodes: Again a Missing Link?
Another literature that has by and large ignored domestic debt is the empirical
literature on high and hyperinflation. Ever since Cagan (1956), researchers have
concentrated on the government’s incentives to gain seignorage revenues off the
monetary base.15 Indeed, a recurring paradox in this literature is why governments
sometimes seem to inflate above and beyond the seignorage-maximizing rate. Many
clever and plausible answers have been offered to this question, with issues of time
consistency and credibility featuring prominently. We submit, however, that the presence
of significant domestic public debt may be a major overlooked factor, especially
considering—as we have already discussed—that a large share of debt was often long
term and non-indexed. We do not refer simply to the study of rare hyperinflation
episodes but equally to the much more common phenomenon of high and moderately
high inflation as studied, for example, by Dornbusch and Fischer (1986) and many others
since.
Although there are literally hundreds of empirical papers on inflationary finance
in developing countries and post-conflict economies, domestic debt is rarely mentioned,
much less employed in time-series analysis. As in the external debt literature, the
implicit assumption is that domestic public debt is relatively unimportant. But is this a
good approximation? Perhaps the answer is yes in some cases, but as Table 3 suggests,
there are many important episodes where domestic debt appears to have been a major

15

Sargent (1982) does include data on central bank holdings of treasury bills for the five post–World War I
countries (Austria, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia) in his classic paper. But of course, these
debts are essentially a wash on the consolidated government balance sheet.

17

factor in the government’s incentive to inflate, if not indeed the dominant one.16 Thus a
comparison of actual inflation rates to any hypothetical “seignorage-maximizing rate,”
calculated only off the monetary base, may often be beside the point.
We see in Table 3, for example, that when post–World War I inflation first spiked
up to 66 percent in Germany in 1920, domestic debt was almost triple the size of the
monetary base. In the case of Brazil, debt was almost 20 times the size of the money
base.17
The importance of domestic debt is hardly confined to hyperinflations. Table 3
lists a number of high-inflation episodes as well. Domestic public debt was almost 80
percent of total domestic liabilities (including currency) in 1945 Japan, when inflation
went over 500 percent. In all of the cases listed in Table 3, domestic public debt is at
least the same order of magnitude as the monetary base (with the exception of Norway in
1918, where it was slightly below).
Precise calculations of how much governments gained by inflating down the real
value of debt require considerably more information on the maturity structure and interest
payments than is available in our cross-country data set. One also needs to understand
bank reserve requirements, interest rate regulations, the degree of financial repression,
and other constraints to make any kind of precise calculation. But the fact that domestic
nominal debt is so large compared to base money across so many important high-

16

Of course, the possibility of using unanticipated inflation to default on nominal debt is well understood
in the theoretical literature, e.g., Barro (1983).
17
The Brazil case is exceptional in that some of the debt was indexed to inflation, although lags in the
indexation scheme still made it possible for the government to largely inflate away the debt with a high
enough rate of inflation. Indeed, this appears to be exactly what happened as the country lurched in and out
of hyperinflation for many years.

18

inflation episodes suggests that this factor needs to be given far more attention in future
studies.18
VI: Who Is Senior? Domestic Residents or Foreigners?
We have shown that domestic debt is large in general, and in many episodes of
external default or high inflation, in particular. Clearly, in trying to understand how
crises play out, it would be helpful to better understand the relative seniority of domestic
and foreign debt. This section is an attempt to provide a first pass at some key
characteristics of the data. Clearly, the answer is going to differ across countries and
time. Many factors, such as central bank independence and exchange rate regime, are
likely going to be relevant. Nevertheless, a few simple comparisons of the trajectory of
output and inflation during the run-up and aftermath to domestic and external defaults are
revealing.19
Our calculations can be taken only as suggestive for several reasons. One is
simply that, as we have already emphasized, there is no comprehensive database on overt
domestic debt defaults prior to our own, much less on de facto defaults. While we are
confident that we have a relatively complete picture of external defaults and episodes of
high inflation in our sample, we simply do not know how many domestic default
episodes we may have missed, even restricting attention to de jure defaults. Appendix I
provides a broad indication of how hidden in the historical archives are clear episodes of

18

Calvo and Guidotti (1992) develop a model of the optimal maturity structure of nominal debt, where the
government trades off flexibility (the option to inflate away long-term debt when under financial duress)
versus maintaining high credibility for maintaining a low inflation rate (achieved by having very short-term
debt which is more difficult to inflate away).
19
It should also be noted that other economic indicators (besides inflation and per capita GDP growth,
which we examine in detail) would provide a richer answer to the broad question of how bad conditions
have to be before contemplating default (specifically, the impacts of domestic versus foreign default on
social indicators relating to poverty, health, income distribution, etc., are bound to be quite different).

19

domestic default or restructuring. Thus, our list of domestic defaults is surely a lower
bound on the actual incidence.

Finally, but worthy of discussion, our approach is systematic in documenting the
incidence of default but it is silent on assessing the magnitude of default. Even though
our new database on public debt can provide a valuable insight on the magnitudes
involved in the original default or restructuring, it would be a stretch of the imagination
to suggest that these data provide a snapshot of the subsequent restructuring nuances or
the actual recovery rates. With these caveats in mind, a number of results stand out.

20

The antecedents of domestic and external default
First, how bad are macroeconomic conditions on the eve of default?
Unambiguously, output declines in the run-up to default on domestic debt are typically
significantly worse than for external debt. As highlighted in Figure 6 and 7, the average
cumulative decline in output during the three-year run-up to a domestic default crisis is 8
percent. The output decline on the year of the domestic debt crisis alone is 4 percent; the
comparable average decline for the external debt events is 1.2 percent. To compare the
antecedents of the domestic and external defaults, we performed a variety of tests for
individual years, as well as for the cumulative change in the window prior to default. In
the latter test, there are a total of 224 observations for domestic crises (that is, the number
of annual observations in advance of domestic crises) and 813 for external crashes (again,
years times number of crises).
As noted earlier, the results have to be interpreted with care, as many domestic
episodes are twin default crises and, as such, output is also suffering from limited access
(if at all) to external credit.

The comparable exercise for the inflation rate yields even starker differences
(Figures 8 and 9); default through inflation goes hand in hand with domestic default—
before, during, and after the more explicit domestic expropriations. The extensive

22

scholarly literature on inflation has been silent on this point.20 Inflation during the year
of external default is on average high, at 33 percent.21 However, inflation truly gallops
during domestic debt crises, averaging 170 percent in the year of the default.22 After the
domestic default, inflation remains at or above 100 percent in the following years. We
conclude that overt domestic default tends to occur only in times of severe
macroeconomic distress.

The incidence of domestic and external default
To shed some light on the incidence of expropriation of residents versus
nonresidents, we constructed four time series for the period 1800–2007: the probability
of external default (or the share of countries in our sample that are in external default in a
given year); the comparable statistic for domestic default episodes; the probability of an
inflation crisis (defined here as the share of countries in any given year during our more
than 200-year sample where the annual rate of inflation exceeded 20 percent); and the
sum of the incidence of high inflation and domestic default, which summarizes the
expropriation of the holdings of domestic residents.23, 24
Figure 10 shows the probability of external default versus the comparable statistic
for domestic default either through inflation or explicit default. For the early period

23

Details on the underlying macroeconomic data are given in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).
The United States is, of course, the modern exception. Virtually all U.S. debt is domestic (as the Carter
bonds have been extinguished), yet about 40 percent is held by nonresidents (mostly central banks and
other official institutions), but it is dollar denominated. Thus, inflation in the United States would also
affect nonresidents.

24

24

through World War II, the incidence of external default is higher.25 Table 5 presents
some summary statistics on the underlying data. For 1800–1939, the probability of
external default is about 20 percent versus 12 percent for domestic residents. For the
entire sample, there is no statistically significant difference in the incidence of default on
locals versus foreigners. With the widespread adoption of fiat money, inflation
apparently became the more expedient form of expropriation. As a result, the incidence
of taxing locals increased after World War II.26
Figure 11 plots the probability of domestic default as a share of the probability of
default. A ratio above 0.5 implies domestics do worse, while one less than 0.5 implies
foreigners do worse.
Certainly, this admittedly very crude first pass at the evidence does nothing to
dissuade our prior belief that domestic debt is often held by important political
stakeholders in debtor countries, and cannot always be lightly dismissed as strictly junior
debt.

25

The huge spike in external defaults in the 1820s owes to the much-studied first wave of sovereign
defaults of the newly independent Latin American countries—but Greece and Portugal also defaulted at
this time.

VII. Conclusions
In this paper, we provide an extensive new cross-country data set on a key
macroeconomic variable that governments often manage to keep remarkably hidden from
26

view: domestic public debt. We also present what we believe to be the first attempt at a
cross-country international catalogue of historical defaults on domestic public debt,
spanning two centuries and sixty-four countries.
Our first look at the data suggests that researchers need to revisit the empirical
literature on the sustainability of external government debt and on government’s
incentives to engage in high and hyperinflation, taking into account the newly uncovered
data on domestic public debt. Of course, how the overhang of domestic debt impacts
inflation and external default will vary across episodes and circumstances. In some cases,
the domestic debt is eliminated through high inflation, in other cases, governments
default on external debt.
How did domestic public debt in emerging markets fall off many economists’
radar screen? Many researchers, aware only of difficulties that emerging markets had in
issuing debt in the ultra-high-inflation 1980s and 1990s, simply believed that no one
would ever voluntarily lend money to a kleptocratic emerging market government. The
logical implication was that such debt must not exist. True, there are exceptions. Alesina
and Tabellini (1990) consider a theoretical case where domestic debt is honored ahead of
external debt. But absent any data, or even any awareness of the one-time existence of
significant quantities of domestic public debt in virtually every emerging market, these
isolated examples have had no great impact on the mainstream academic or policy
literature.
Perhaps the most surprising and significant finding of our study is simply the lack
of transparency so many governments and multilateral institutions exhibit in making time
series on domestic debt easily available. After all, these governments routinely tap

27

domestic and foreign markets to sell debt. Standard auction theory—much of which is
admittedly static—suggests that it should be in the interest of sellers to convey
information, especially when the debt can be resold in secondary markets. Even more
puzzling is why global investors do not insist on historical information relevant to the
value of securities they may purchase. Understanding why so many governments do not
make it easier for standard databases to incorporate their debt history is an important
question for future research.
From a policy perspective, there is a plausible case that an international agency
would be providing a valuable public good if it could enforce (or at least promote) basic
reporting requirements and transparency across countries. Given the apparent large
historical role of domestic public debt in helping to precipitate developing country
external debt and inflation crises, it is a great curiosity indeed that today’s multilateral
financial institutions have never fully taken up the task of systematically publishing the
data. This failure, especially in light of these agencies’ supposed role at the vanguard of
warning policymakers and investors about crisis risks, is stunning. Instead, the system
has seemed to forget about the history of domestic debt entirely, thinking that today’s
blossoming of internal public debt markets is something entirely new and different.27 But
as our historical data set on domestic debt underscores with surprising force, nothing
could be further from the truth.

27

Beyond simply reporting debt data, international financial institutions such as the International Monetary
Fund or the World Bank can, of course, also help with disseminating best practices (see, for example, the
institutional evolution discussed in Wallis and Weingast, 1988).

Appendix I. The sample
The debt data covers the countries shown in Appendix Table 1 (9 in Africa; 9 in
Asia; 23 in Europe; 19 in Latin America, 2 in North America; and 2 in Oceania). The
domestic default episodes encompass all countries that have defaulted on their domestic
debt (See Appendix Table 2 for a definition of default and Appendix Table 3 for a full list
of the episodes).
As the final column in Appendix Table 1 illustrates, our sample of sixty-four
countries indeed accounts for about 90 percent of world GDP. Many of these countries,
particularly those in Africa and Asia, have become independent nations only relatively
recently (column 2).

Appendix II: Domestic debt data
The central government debt data assembled in this study is both broad in its
cross-country coverage and spans nearly one-hundred years for most countries (1914 to

35

2007) and even longer for many others.28 Here we present a synopsis of “state-of-theart” information on public debt (available data, sources, scope, etc.). We also highlight
some of the salient characteristics of the long time series we study, in addition to what we
have already discussed in section II of the text.29
Data preliminaries
Government debt is among the most elusive of economic time series.
For the advanced economies, the most comprehensive data comes from the
OECD, which provides time series on general government debt since 1980. However,
this data has several important limitations: it only includes a handful of emerging
markets; for many advanced economies (France, Finland, Greece, and the U.K., to name
a few) the data actually begins much later (in the 1990s), which cannot be considered as
much of a time series; and only total debt is reported, with no particulars provided for the
composition of debt (domestic versus foreign) or its maturity (long-term versus shortterm). To state that the IMF’s well-known World Economic Outlook (WEO) database
extends to public debt requires a stretch of the imagination.30 Data is only provided for
the G-7 from 1980 onwards (out of 183 countries covered in the WEO).
The most comprehensive data on public debt in emerging market economies
comes from the World Bank’s Global Development Finance—GDF (known previously
as the World Debt Tables). It is an improvement on other databases in that it begins (for
most countries) in 1970 and provides extensive detail on the particulars of external debt.
28

The regional coverage is, unfortunately, uneven: coverage of Africa is relatively sparse (although we
incorporate some excellent data from colonial records); it is, of course, most complete for Europe, North
America, and Oceania.
29
For compete references underlying this appendix and its accompanying database, see Reinhart and
Rogoff (2008).
30
This description comes from the IMF’s web site “Download time series data for GDP growth, inflation,
unemployment, payments balances, exports, imports, external debt, capital flows, commodity prices,
more.”

36

Yet, GDF also has serious limitations, besides the fact that it covers only external debt.
Neither advanced economies are included to facilitate comparisons, nor are such newly
industrialized countries as Israel, Korea, or Singapore. Unlike data from the IMF and the
World Bank for exchange rates, prices, government finances, etc., there is no data prior to
1970. For a few countries, such as Panama or Cote D’Ivoire, external debt is a sufficient
statistic on government liabilities, because domestic public debt levels are relatively
trivial. For most countries, however, domestic debt accounts for an important share of
total government debt. As we have already noted in the text, the all-country average
oscillates between 40 to 80 percent during 1900 to 2006.31
In search of the elusive data on total public debt, we examined the archives of the
League of Nations and found that the institution collected information on, among other
things, public domestic and external debt in its Statistical Yearbook (1926–1944). While
neither the IMF nor the World Bank continued this practice after the war, the newly
formed United Nations (UN) inherited the data collected by the League of Nations. In
1948, the UN Department of Economic Affairs published a special volume on public debt
that spanned 1914 to 1946. From that time onwards, the UN continued to collect and
publish the domestic and external debt data in the same format as their prewar
predecessor on an annual basis in their Statistical Yearbooks. As former colonies became
independent nations, the database expanded accordingly. This practice continued until
1983, at which time the domestic and external public debt series were discontinued. In
total, these sources yield time series that span 1914 to 1983 for the most complete cases.
It covers advanced and developing economies. For the most part, it also disaggregates

31

For some countries, such as the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United States, practically all public debt
is domestic.

37

domestic debt into its long-term and short-term components. To the best of our
knowledge, these data are not available electronically in any database. Hence obtaining it
required going to the original publications. These data provide the starting point for our
public debt series, which have been extended to the period prior to 1914 and post 1983
whenever possible. The sources are numerous. The material comes from large-scale
historical statistical compendiums (such as Carreras and Tafunell, 2005, Estadísticas
Históricas de España, Siglos XIX-XX) or from individual scholars (for example, Bazant’s,
1968, careful study of Mexico’s domestic and foreign debt, Historia de la Deuda
Exterior de Mexico: 1823-1946). Colonial records were also a valuable source of
information for pre-1914; country-specific statistical and government agencies provide
data for the more recent period.32 Data Appendix IV provides details for the sources by
country and time period. Foreign external debt is from Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).
Appendix III: Crises dates
Appendix Table1 defines the criteria as to what constitutes a domestic debt crisis.
Specifically, as with sovereign default it is defined as:
1. A failure to meet a principal or interest payment on the due date (or within the
specified grace period). (These episodes also include instances where rescheduled debt is
ultimately extinguished on less favorable terms.)
2. The freezing of bank deposits and or forcible conversions of such deposits from
dollars to local currency.
3. The abrogation of indexation clauses, as the United States did in the 1930s and as
Argentina is doing at the time of this writing in 2008.
32

For Australia, Ghana, India, Korea, South Africa among others, we have put together debt data for much
of the colonial period from British statistical sources which tracked the colonies. We also have similar
colonial data for former Japanese colonies.

38

To our knowledge, this is the first effort to chronicle systematically sovereign defaults on
domestic debts, along the lines that economic historians have documented external
sovereign defaults. The closest source comparable to these dates on domestic sovereign
default is Standard and Poor’s.33
For a detailed description of all other data used in this study by country and by
year see Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).

Definition and or Criteria

Comments

A sovereign default is defined as the
failure to meet a principal or interest
payment on the due date (or within the
specified grace period). The episodes
also include instances where
rescheduled debt is ultimately
extinguished in terms less favorable
than the original obligation.
The definition given above for external
debt applies. In addition, domestic debt
crises have involved the freezing of
bank deposits and or forcible
conversions of such deposits from
dollars to local currency.

While the time of default is accurately
classified as a crisis year there are a large
number of cases where the final resolution
with the creditors (if it ever did take place)
seems interminable. For this reason we also
work with a crisis dummy that only picks up
the first year.
There is at best some partial documentation
of recent defaults on domestic debt provided
by Standard and Poor’s. Historically, it is
very difficult to date these episodes and in
many cases (such as banking crises), it is
impossible to ascertain the date of the final
resolution.

33

See the careful analysis of Beers and Chambers, Sovereign Defaults At 26-Year Low, To Show Little
Change In 2007, which covers domestic default post-1975. Since this study is focused only on domestic
public debt, it does miss some key episodes, such as forcible conversions of foreign currency bank deposits.
These episodes constitute defaults on domestic debt because, typically, the government simultaneously
writes down the value of treasury debt held by banks.

Commentary
This default also extended to several so-called
“internal” bonds. These bonds although not issued
in London, were denominated in a foreign currency
(£s) and marketed abroad—the forerunners of the
Mexican Tesobonos of the 1990s.
Consolidated internal debt plan to deal with the
arrears on most government bonds since 1919.
During the crisis, foreign debts were serviced but
domestic debt was reduced by 39 percent.
After the restructuring of foreign debt in October of
that year, domestic debt was roughly cut in half.
Domestic debt accounted for 60 percent of total
public debt.
Domestic colonial debts were not cancelled—debt
prices collapsed and this debt was only restructured
in 1850.
Repudiation of debts and confiscation of gold in all
forms followed by confiscation of all foreign
exchange.
Among several conversions of debt into lower
coupon rates. Reductions in rates were mostly 0.5–
1.0 percent in these episodes.
Nominal interest was maintained at 6 percent, but a
portion of the interest was deferred for 10 years.
Three states repudiated their debts altogether.
By 1873, 10 states were in default. In the case of
West Virginia, settlement was as late as 1919.

Commentary
Arrears of interest lasted until at least 1940.
The only province to default—which lasted for about 10
years.
First of several “consolidations”, monthly cost of
domestic service was cut in half. Interest rates were
reduced to 6 percent (from over 9 percent)—amortization
periods were about doubled in length.
Interest on domestic debt was reduced by 75 percent since
1932; Domestic debt was about 1/4 of total public debt.
Service on external debt was suspended in 1928. During
the 1930s, interest payments included “arrears of
expenditure and civil and military pensions.”
After suspending service on external debt on May 29,
Peru made “partial interest payments” on domestic debt.
Redemption of domestic and foreign debt is suspended
(except for three loans).
Interest payments on external debt were suspended,
arrears on domestic debt service.
Abrogation of the gold clause. In effect, the U.S. refused
to pay Panama the annuity in gold due to Panama
according to a 1903 treaty. The dispute was settled in
1936 when the US paid the agreed amount in gold
balboas.
Most of the outstanding WWI debt was consolidated into
a 3.5 percent perpetual annuity.
After suspending redemption of external debt on January
20, redemptions on domestic debt were equally
suspended.
Restoration of schilling (150 limit per person). Remainder
placed in blocked accounts. In December 1947, large
amounts of previously blocked schillings invalidated and
rendered worthless. Temporary blockage of 50 percent of
deposits.
Monetary reform limiting 40 Deutschemark per person.
Partial cancellation and blocking of all accounts.
After inflation, exchange of all bank notes for new issue
(1 to 1) limited to 100 yen per person. Remaining
balances were deposited in blocked accounts.
The monetary reform subjected privately held currency to
a 90 percent reduction.
Repudiation of domestic debt (about 253 billion rubles at
the time).

Forcible conversion of U.S. dollar debt to peso debt.
U.S. dollar deposits were forcibly converted into local
currency. Foreign currency deposits were again allowed

controls were lifted.
Abrogation of inflation-linked indices embedded in the
original contracts. Largest default (US$ 62 billion) in
1990.

The only case in Latin America where there was a default
in domestic debt that was NOT accompanied by external
default.
Forcible conversion of dollar deposits to pesos.
Arrears in domestic suppliers’ credit, wages, and civil and
military pensions.
U.S. dollar deposits were forcibly converted into local
currency. Foreign currency deposits were allowed again
in 1988.

With over 98.5 percent of domestic debt with maturities
less than a year, there is a restructuring.

42

Appendix Figure 1 plots for the years 1900–2006 (where our data set is most
complete) the percentage of all independent countries in a state of default or restructuring
on domestic sovereign debt during any given year. One fact that jumps out from the
figure are the two long periods where a higher percentage of all countries are in a state of
default or restructuring. Like banking crises (see Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008), domestic
debt crises are bunched during the Great Depression of the 1930s and debt crises which
began in the early 1980s.
