    "abstract": "\n\nThe growing \u201celectrify everything\u201d movement aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by transitioning households and \ufb01rms away from natural gas toward electricity. This paper considers what this transition means for the customers who are left behind. Using historical evidence from growing and shrinking U.S. natural gas utilities, we show that utilities add pipelines but rarely remove them, even when the customer base from which to recover costs is shrinking. Correspondingly, we \ufb01nd that utility revenues decrease less than one-for-one when a customer base is shrinking, consistent with higher bills for remaining customers. We then use our empirical estimates to predict how customer bills might increase in the future for di\ufb00erent levels of building electri\ufb01cation. We highlight the equity implications of our results and conclude by discussing alternative utility \ufb01nancing options such as recouping \ufb01xed costs through taxes rather than prices.\n\n",
