The equivalent of Bayes' rule is derived for recursively updating the joint characteristic function of latent variables and the data conditional upon past data. Likelihood functions can consequently be evaluated directly by Fourier inversion. An application to daily stock returns over 1953-96 reveals substantial divergences from EMM-based estimates: in particular, more substantial and time-varying jump risk.\n\n",
