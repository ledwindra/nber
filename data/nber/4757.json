    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reinvestigates the evidence on the impact of the minimum wage on employment in Puerto Rico.  The strongest evidence that the minimum wage had a negative effect on employment comes from an aggregate time series analysis.  The weakest evidence comes from cross-industry analyses.  The main finding of the paper, however, is that the statistical evidence of a negative employment effect of the minimum wage in Puerto Rico is surprisingly fragile.\n\n",
