The government often provides relief against large risks, such as disasters. A simple, general rationale
for this role of government is considered here that applies even when private contracting to share risks
is not subject to market imperfections. Specifically, the optimal private sharing of risks will not result
in complete coverage against them when they are sufficiently large. Hence, when such risks eventuate,

goods. Consequently, social welfare may be raised if the government reduces public goods expenditures
and directs these freed resources toward individuals who have suffered losses.

The government often provides relief against large risks, such as disasters.
A simple, general rationale for this role of government is considered here that
applies even when private contracting to share risks is not subject to market
imperfections. Specifically, the optimal private sharing of risks will not result in
complete coverage against them when they are sufficiently large. Hence, when
such risks eventuate, the marginal utility to individuals of governmental relief
may exceed the marginal value of public goods. Consequently, social welfare
may be raised if the government reduces public goods expenditures and directs
these freed resources toward individuals who have suffered losses.

1. Introduction
The government plays a well-recognized role in providing relief against
many large risks. Notably, the government traditionally furnishes disaster
assistance and subsidizes markets for flood and earthquake insurance. 1
That the government is often observed to ameliorate substantial risks
naturally raises the question about the justification for that policy. I consider here
a general rationale for the government to relieve significant risks that applies even

On the role of the government in disaster assistance, see generally the historical account
of Moss (1999) and, for example, the website of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), www.fema.gov; on government programs to foster flood and earthquake insurance, see
FEMA (2002) and the website of the California Earthquake Authority,
www.earthquakeauthority.com. The government also promotes and furnishes other types of
insurance, such as disability and health insurance, of course, but the basis for these types of aid
appears to be different from that discussed here.

1

when, as I will assume, private contracting to share risks is perfect (unimpeded by
transaction costs, asymmetric information, externalities, or other sources of
market failure). The rationale, in essence, is that the optimal private sharing of
very large risks will not result in complete coverage against them. Therefore,
when the risks eventuate, the marginal utility to individuals of relief from the
government will be high in a relative sense and may exceed the marginal value to
individuals of public goods. Consequently, social welfare may be raised if the
government reduces public goods expenditures and directs these freed resources
toward individuals who have suffered losses.
Although the foregoing argument is straightforward, it does not seem to
have been clearly articulated before. I develop it below employing a simple
model involving a population of identical individuals, a single consumption good,
a risk of loss of the consumption good—where this accident risk may be
correlated across individuals—frictionless joint contracting among all individuals
to share risk, and a government that produces a public good.
Two times are considered in the model: time 1, before risk resolves itself,
and time 2, after possible accident losses have occurred. At time 1, individuals
pay a tax to finance the public good and they contract in a privately-optimal way
to share risk. Their best risk-sharing contracts do not lead to full coverage against
loss. Indeed, in the extreme case of a single, economy-wide risk (a flood that
affects everyone), contracting would not result in any coverage; the
privately-optimal risk-sharing contract would be the null contract.
The main results shown are these. First, there exists a welfare-enhancing
policy under which the government grants relief to accident victims whenever the
number of accidents in the population is sufficiently high. 2 Welfare is enhanced

2

The policy of government relief will, however, result in some crowding out of payments
made to accident victims under private risk-sharing contracts.

2

for the reason I noted above: when the number of accidents is high, the wealth of
accident victims after optimal risk-sharing is relatively low and their marginal
utility of income is relatively high, implying that they will be made better off if
resources are shifted from public goods to them by the making of relief payments.
Second, a policy of government relief exists that achieves the first-best outcome
in terms of both risk-sharing and provision of public goods. Third, a policy of
government subsidy of risk-sharing contracts (analogous to the subsidy of
insurance contracts) may provide social benefits similar to those of government
relief. 3 And fourth, a policy under which taxes are lowered appropriately as the
number of accidents increases allows the first-best outcome to be achieved
without government relief or the subsidy of risk-sharing contracts.
The general justification for government aid in the event of large risks that
is examined in the model seems consistent with actual policy in at least an
approximate sense. On one hand, the important risks mentioned above that the
government helps to alleviate have the character that they may affect many
individuals simultaneously; this is frequently true of disasters. On the other hand,
private insurance coverage against these positively correlated risks tends to be
circumscribed, 4 making it plausible that a shift of resources from the provision of
public goods to those who have suffered losses would often be socially desirable.
The rationale for government help in the face of large, correlated risks
presented here is different from those discussed in prior writing to my

3

As will be seen, a well-designed ex post subsidy of coverage payments made to accident
victims will be socially beneficial, but an ex ante subsidy of risk-sharing contracts cannot improve
social welfare because it does not make public goods expenditures depend on the occurrence of
accidents.
4

Regarding the paucity (and high cost) of private insurance coverage against catastrophic
events, see generally Froot (1999, 2001), and also, for example, Jaffee and Russell (1997) and
Cummins (2006). As Froot emphasizes, the scarcity of coverage due to these correlated losses is
significant, even though one might have expected otherwise, given the existence of the reinsurance
industry and the size of global capital markets.

knowledge. First, some authors who have stressed that insurance coverage
against disasters is limited suggest that this problem per se justifies government
relief. 5 But that conclusion does not follow when the limited coverage is the
result of privately-optimal risk sharing—government relief is warranted only if
the government provides public goods. If the government has no need to provide
public goods, the government will not have command over resources to
advantageously draw upon to furnish relief when privately-optimal risk sharing
leaves individuals wanting. 6
A second reason for government aid is premised on the assumption that
the government is uniquely able to distribute risk over the entire population
through the medium of the income tax system. Under this assumption, when the
government assumes a risk, like that of a natural disaster, the impact on the
individual taxpayer in a large population is small, making the government a
desirable bearer of risk. 7 The foregoing argument is different from the one I
consider because I assume that all individuals in the population are able to jointly
contract to share risk. Hence, in the model examined below, the government does
not enjoy any advantage over the private sector in the spreading of private risks
across the population.

5

See, for example, the discussion of the coverage of terrorism risk in Cummins (2006), p.

375.
6

The reader can verify that if there is no demand for public goods, the first-best outcome
described in Proposition 1 is achieved under privately optimal risk-sharing described in
Proposition 2.
7

This argument is developed by Arrow and Lind (1970), who show under certain
assumptions not only that the risk-bearing cost per individual tends to zero with the population
size, but also that the aggregate risk-bearing cost tends to zero.

4

A third justification for government relief is that individuals may
systematically underestimate risk, leading them to underinsure. 8 A fourth
justification is adverse selection, for it can reduce or eliminate private coverage
even though coverage would be socially desirable. 9 These two reasons for
government aid are obviously different from that advanced here.
Finally, let me comment on writing that is skeptical of the basis for a
governmental role in relieving large risks. The most commonly made argument
against a governmental role is an expression of the general view that
governmental intervention in reasonably well-functioning markets—here
insurance markets—tends to be undesirable. 10 This classic laissez-faire belief,
though, is not necessarily valid when applied to insurance markets. As I have
emphasized is the case in the model developed here, even if private markets for
risk-sharing function efficiently, the government should sometimes act to relieve
risk using funds that otherwise would finance public goods.
More particular arguments are also made against government relief against
risk. One of note is that although problems of moral hazard (for example, an
insured person inefficiently building a house in an area vulnerable to floods) may
lead to limited coverage against risk, moral hazard is not a justification for
government relief. Moral hazard is in fact generally exacerbated by provision of
government relief. 11 Such problems are serious ones that should clearly be taken
into account in the design of policies for relief, but the model here abstracts from
them.

2. The Model
2.1 Basic assumptions. There is an economy of n individuals with
identical utility functions. Each individual derives utility from consumption of a
single good, wealth, with respect to which he is risk-averse, and also from a
public good. In particular, let i be the index of a person and define
yi = wealth of person i; yi ≥ 0;
u(yi) = utility of person i from wealth yi; u′(yi) > 0 and u′′(yi) < 0;
z = quantity of a public good; z ≥ 0; and
v(z) = utility of each person from the public good; v′(z) > 0 and v′′(z) < 0.
All individuals obtain utility simultaneously from z because it is a public good.
Let the total utility of an individual be given by
w(yi, z) = u(yi) + v(z).
The assumption that utility from wealth and from the public good are separable is
made mainly for convenience. 12 Now let me describe the amount of wealth in the
economy and the risks of accidents. Each person has identical initial wealth; let
yo = initial endowment of wealth of each person; yo > 0.
Individuals face a risk of an accident, where
h = harm that is suffered by an individual if an accident occurs; 0 < h < yo.
The harm h is a diminution in wealth of fixed magnitude and is the same for all
individuals. 13 Let
si = 0 if person i does not have an accident;
12

The importance of this assumption is that it implies that the socially optimal level of
individual consumption and of the public good are each rising in total wealth.
13

I do not consider non-monetary harm, such as due to pain and suffering from an injury.
In the central case of non-monetary harm—in which the harm is a decline in utility but does not
involve any change in the utility from wealth—there is no demand for insurance. See Cook and
Graham (1977). Hence, in that case, the issue studied in the model would be moot; and if harm
were both a monetary loss and a utility loss, the results to be obtained here would be unaltered.

6

= 1 if person i does have an accident;
and call s = (s1, . . . , sn) a complete accident state. Let
p(s) = probability of s; and
pm = probability that exactly m accidents occur; m = 0, 1, . . . , n;
so that pm is the sum of p(s) over the s such that exactly m accidents occur. I will
call the event in which exactly m accidents occur an accident event m and will
assume that there are at least two accident events (including the no accident
event) that occur with positive probability (otherwise there would be no
uncertainty in the economy). In an accident event m, total wealth in the economy
will be nyo – mh since nyo is total initial wealth and mh is total accident losses.
I assume that wealth can be converted into the public good on a one-forone basis, so that if z units of wealth are allocated to provision of the public good,
then z will be the level of the public good.
To describe an allocation of total wealth given an accident event m, let
yi(m) = wealth allocated to person i in accident event m; yi(m) ≥ 0;
z(m) = quantity of the public good in accident event m; z(m) ≥ 0.
A feasible allocation given accident event m is any (y1(m), …, yn(m), z(m)) such
that 14
(1)

(∑iyi(m)) + z(m) = nyo – mh.

A feasible allocation scheme is a feasible allocation for each accident event m.
I make two additional assumptions (that will be seen to guarantee that the
best feasible allocation schemes involve positive levels of both consumption of
wealth and the public good). First,
(2)

u′(0) > nv′(n(yo – h)),

14

In considering only the feasible allocations given by (1), I am making two harmless
simplifications: that total wealth is exhausted by an allocation; and that allocations do not depend
on complete accident states (rather than only on accident events m).

7

that is, the marginal utility of consumption when no wealth is allocated to
consumption exceeds the marginal social utility of the public good when all
wealth is allocated to the public good (and n accidents occur). Second,
(3)

u′(yo – h) < v′(0),

the marginal utility of the public good when no wealth is allocated to it exceeds
the marginal utility of consumption even when a person has suffered an accident
loss.
Finally, I assume that social welfare is the expected utility of the
representative individual, that is, the expected utility of an individual, assuming
that each of the identical individuals enjoys the same expected utility.
2.2 First-best solution. The social welfare-maximizing feasible allocation
scheme, under which each individual obtains the same expected utility, will be
denoted (y1*(m), …, yn*(m), z*(m)), m = 0,…, n. It is described as follows.
Proposition 1. Under the first-best allocation scheme,
(a) in any accident event m, each individual’s level of consumption yi*(m)
is the same, equal to a common level y*(m) = yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h;
(b) the level of each individual’s consumption y*(m) as well as the level of
the public good z*(m) is positive and they are strictly decreasing in the number of
accidents, as determined by (9) below.
Notes. The explanation for this result is, in essence, that since individuals
are risk averse and identical, it must be optimal for consumption levels to be equal
in any accident event. Further, because the total wealth available for consumption
in an accident event m is nyo – z*(m) – mh, the per capita amount available for
consumption is yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h. And since total available wealth falls as the
number of accidents rises, it is desirable for both the total allocation of wealth
toward consumption and that toward public goods to be lowered, in order to
maintain equality between the marginal social value of consumption and the

8

marginal social value of public goods (in effect, consumption and the public good
are both normal goods for the representative person).
Proof: The problem is to maximize the expected utility of an individual
subject to the feasibility constraints (1) and to the constraint that the expected
utility of each individual is the same. To this end, I will consider a related
problem: maximize the sum of the expected utilities of the n individuals subject
only to the feasibility constraints. I will show that the solution to this related
problem is such that each individual’s expected utility is the same. It will follow
that the solution to the related problem must be the solution to the given
problem. 15
Turning therefore to the problem of maximizing the sum of the expected
utilities of individuals, note that the expected utility of person i under a feasible
allocation scheme is
(4)

∑mpmw(yi(m), z(m)) = ∑mpm[u(yi(m)) + v(z(m))].

The sum of expected utilities over the population is therefore
(5)

∑i∑mpm[u(yi(m)) + v(z(m))] = ∑mpm∑i[u(yi(m)) + v(z(m))].

Hence, to maximize the sum of expected utilities over feasible allocation schemes
it is necessary and sufficient for each accident event m to maximize
(6)

∑i[u(yi(m)) + v(z(m))] = [∑iu(yi(m))] + nv(z(m)),

subject to the feasibility constraints (1). Substituting for z(m) using (1), the
problem is to maximize
(7) [∑iu(yi(m))] + nv(nyo – mh – ∑iyi(m))
over yi(m). Since (7) is concave in yi(m), the optimum is uniquely determined by
(8) u′(yi(m)) = nv′(nyo – mh – ∑iyi(m))
15

In particular, let the feasible allocation scheme that maximizes the sum of expected
utilities be denoted S, and let e be the expected utility of each person under this scheme, so that ne
is the maximum sum of expected utilities. If S is not the scheme that maximizes the expected
utility of each person subject to the constraint that each has the same expected utility, there must
exist another scheme S′ under which each person obtains expected utility e′ > e. But then ne′ >
ne, contradicting the assumption that S maximized the sum of expected utilities.

9

if there is an interior solution (which I will show to be so below). Because (8)
must hold for all i and the right side of (8) is independent of i, we know that
u′(yi(m)) = u′(yj(m)) and thus that yi(m) = yj(m) for any j ≠ i. Consequently, there
is a common value y(m) of the yi(m). Accordingly, (8) becomes
(9)

u′(y(m)) = nv′(nyo – mh – ny(m));

it is this condition that determines y*(m) and thus (using (1)), we know that z*(m)
= nyo – mh – ny*(m) and that y*(m) = yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h. The interpretation of
(9) is that the marginal utility of consumption equals n times the marginal utility
of the public good; the factor n enters because if each individual changes his
consumption by one unit of wealth, the level of the public good must change by n
units. To show that a solution to (9) exists and that y*(m) and z*(m) are positive,
observe that when y(m) is 0, the left side of (9) is u′(0) and the right is nv′(nyo –
mh). Further, (2) implies that
(10) u′(0) > nv′(nyo – mh).
Observe as well that if z(m) is 0, the left side of (9) is u′(yo – (m/n)h) and the right
side is nv′(0). But (3) implies that
(11) u′(yo – (m/n)h) < nv′(0).
These two inequalities and the facts that u′(y(m)) is decreasing in y(m) and that
nv′(nyo – mh – ny(m)) is increasing in y(m) imply that the claims about the
solution to (9) must hold.
To determine how y*(m) and z*(m) depend on m, it will be convenient to
ask how they depend on total wealth, nyo – mh. To this end, in this paragraph
denote y*(m) simply by y*, z*(m) by z*, and total wealth by k. Then (9) can be
rewritten as u′(y*) = nv′(k – ny*). Implicitly differentiating this equation with
respect to k, we obtain
(12) u′′(y*)y*′(k) = n(1 – ny*′(k))v′′(k – ny*)
or
(13) y*′(k) = nv′′(k – ny*)/(n2v′′(k – ny*) + u′′(y*)).

10

Hence
(14) y*′(k) > 0.
and thus dy*(m)/dm < 0 as claimed. 16 Furthermore, since z* = k – ny*,
(15) z*′(k) = 1 – ny*′(k) > 0,
where the inequality follows from (11). Thus, dz*(m)/dm < 0 as is also claimed. 17
Q. E. D.
2.3 Outcome with private risk-sharing and taxation to provide the public
good. For the purposes of this and later sections, I will make an assumption about
the distribution of complete accident states s = (s1, . . . ,sn). (It was not necessary
to make assumptions about the distribution of s to characterize the first-best
solution.) Let
pi(0, j) = probability that person i does not suffer an accident loss but that
exactly j others do suffer an accident loss.
Thus pi(0, j) is the sum of p(s) over s such that si = 0 and there are exactly j sk
with sk = 1. Likewise, let
pi(1, j) = probability that person i suffers an accident loss and that exactly j
others also suffer an accident loss.
I make the following symmetry of risk assumption: For any two individuals i and
k, pi(0, j) = pk(0, j) and pi(1, j) = pk(1, j) for all j. Let, p(0, j) and p(1, j)
denote these common probabilities across individuals.
The symmetry assumption is satisfied by many types of distributions of
risks, notably risks that are correlated in different ways as well as independent
risks, as several examples will illustrate: (a) Suppose that there is perfect
correlation of risks in the entire population—that all n individuals will
16

This follows because dy*(m)/dm = (dy*(m)/dk)(dk/dm). But (dy*(m)/dk) > 0 by (13)
and dk/dm = –h < 0.
17

This follows by the logic of the previous note.

11

simultaneously suffer an accident loss with probability p; otherwise none will
suffer an accident loss. Then the symmetry assumption is satisfied since the
formulas for pi(1, j) and pi(0, j) do not depend on i. 18 (b) Now suppose that there
is perfect correlation in a subgroup of the population—that some subgroup of m <
n individuals will simultaneously suffer an accident loss with probability p and
that each individual has an equal likelihood of being in such a subgroup of
accident victims; otherwise none will suffer an accident loss. It is easy to verify
here as well that the symmetry assumption is satisfied. 19 (c) Last, suppose that
each individual has an independent probability p of being an accident victim.
Then again the symmetry assumption is satisfied. 20
The symmetry assumption implies the following.
Remark. If the symmetry assumption holds, then conditional on the
occurrence of m accidents, the probability that any given person suffered an
accident loss is m/n.
To verify this claim, observe that the conditional probability in question
for any person i is pi(1, m – 1)/pm, which equals p(1, m – 1)/pm. Call this
common conditional probability q. The expected number of people who
experienced a loss must then be nq, but the actual number who suffer a loss is m.
Hence, nq = m, so that q = m/n as asserted.
The reason that I make the symmetry of risk assumption is that it implies
that the expected utility of all individuals will be the same. Therefore, social
18

In this case, for each i, pi(1, n – 1) = p and pi(1, j) = 0 for j < n – 1, and also pi(0, 0) =
1 – p and p(0, j) = 0 for j ≥ 1.
For each i, pi(1, m – 1) = (m/n)p and pi(1, j) = 0 for j ≠ m – 1, and also pi(0, 0) = 1 – p,
pi(0, m) = (1 – m/n)p, and p(0, j) = 0 for j ≠ 0 or m. Similarly, the symmetry assumption could
hold in a variation of this example, in which the possible subgroups of m individuals are neighbors
or are in some other manner restricted.
19

20

j

For each i, pi(1, j) = pj+1(1 – p)n–j–1(n!/[(j + 1)!(n – j – 1)!]) and pi(0, j) = pj(1 – p)n–
(n!/[j!(n – j)!]).

12

welfare in the model can be measured by the expected utility of the representative
individual. 21
Now let me describe the assumptions about a regime in which the
government imposes a tax to finance the public good and in which individuals
make contracts to share risk.
Specifically, let
t = tax per person to finance the public good; t ≥ 0,
where t is imposed at time 1, before accidents might occur. The amount of the
public good is therefore nt. The expected utility of each individual in the absence
of any contracting is identical and given by
(16) ∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t) + (m/n)u(yo – t – h) + v(nt)].
The reason is that the symmetry assumption implies that conditional on the
accident event m, each person faces the same probability of suffering a loss, m/n.
I assume that individuals also make a risk-sharing contract at time 1.
Specifically, the contract involves all individuals and specifies an amount to be
paid at time 2 if an individual did not suffer an accident loss and an amount to be
received if an individual did suffer an accident loss, where these amounts may
depend on the total number of accidents that occur. 22 Define

21

Nevertheless, the lessons from the model would carry over to a general context in
which risks are not symmetric and differ across individuals. The reason is that the main argument
to be developed depends on two factors that are unrelated to the symmetric risk assumption,
namely, (a) the point that privately-optimal risk-sharing contracts do not lead to full coverage
against large risks and (b) the assumption that the government provides public goods.
22

Other types of private risk-sharing contracts could be considered, notably contracts
among only a subset of individuals, or contracts under which the payment received by an accident
victim depends on the identity of other accident victims rather than just on their total number.
However, examination of a different set of contracts would not alter the main qualitative
conclusion to be reached—that the government can raise the expected utility of individuals by
giving relief in certain circumstances. The reason, in essence, is that, whatever the nature of
private contracting, it cannot control the expenditure of the government on public goods.

13

x(m) = amount paid by a person if he is not an accident victim and m
accidents occur;
r(m) = amount received by a person if he is an accident victim and m
accidents occur.
For the contract to be feasible, we must have, for each m,
(17) (n – m)x(m) = mr(m),
since (n – m) individuals will pay x(m) and m individuals will receive r(m). A
contract will result in the same expected utility for all individuals due to the
symmetry assumption, namely
(18) ∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t – h + r(m)) + v(nt)].
I assume that individuals choose the contract that maximizes (18) subject to (17),
which will be denoted by x*(m) and r*(m); I will call this the privately optimal
risk-sharing contract.
I also assume that the government chooses the tax to maximize social
welfare given that individuals choose the privately optimal risk-sharing contract
(taking the tax as given).
The next result describes the outcome under private contracting and
government taxation to finance the public good.
Proposition 2. Suppose that the government imposes the optimal tax to
finance the public good.
(a) Then under the privately optimal risk-sharing contract, accident
victims will receive r*(m) = (1 – m/n)h, so that they will absorb m/n of their
losses h, and individuals who are not accident victims will pay x*(m) = (m/n)h.
(b) Consequently, the final wealth of all individuals will be the same in
each accident event, namely, yo – t* – (m/n)h, and risk-sharing will be socially
optimal given the level of public expenditures.
(c) The optimal tax t* is determined by (24) below.

14

Notes. That the privately optimal risk-sharing contract results in
equalization of wealth across all individuals for each accident event m reflects the
assumption that individuals are identical and are risk-averse. That this outcome is
socially optimal given the level of expenditures on public goods is clear from the
discussion of the first-best outcome in Proposition 1 (see (8)).
The amount of wealth that individuals enjoy is their per capita share of
total wealth after subtraction of taxes collected and total accident losses. Note
that the fraction (1 – m/n) of his loss received in compensation by an accident
victim depends on the fraction m/n of individuals in the population that suffer
losses. Thus, in particular, if there is a catastrophic event in which a large fraction
of individuals suffer losses, the proportion of losses received by victims will be
small, and would be zero if all were victims (m/n would then equal 1). Note too
that in the standard case of independent risks where the individual accident
probability is p, we know by the law of large numbers that if n is sufficiently high,
then m/n is very likely to be within any specified small positive ε of p. Hence, the
amount received by victims is very likely to approximate (1 – p)h and the amount
paid by those who are not victims is very likely to approximate ph. Thus, the
outcome resembles that from the theory of insurance, for the premium for full
coverage is the actuarially fair amount ph and the net amount received by a victim
is h less his premium of ph or (1 – p)h.
Regarding the optimal tax, the condition (24) equates the marginal social
value of the public good to n times the expected marginal utility of wealth.
Proof. It is clear that, maximizing (18) subject to (17) is equivalent to
maximizing
(19) [(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t – h + r(m))
for each m subject to (17). Using (17), this problem reduces to maximizing
(20) [(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t – h + (n – m)x(m)/m)
over x(m) for each m. The first-order condition for the optimal x(m) reduces to

15

(21) u′(yo – t – x(m)) = u′(yo – t – h + (n – m)x(m)/m),
implying that yo – t – x(m) = yo – t – h + (n – m)x(m)/m, so that x*(m) = (m/n)h
and thus r*(m) = (1 – (m/n))h.
We therefore know that the expected utility of each person given optimal
contracting is, using (18) and what we have just shown about the optimal contract,
(22) ∑mpm[u(yo – t – (m/n)h) + v(nt)] = [∑mpmu(yo – t – (m/n)h)] + v(nt).
The optimal t maximizes (22), the derivative of which is
(23) –∑mpmu′(yo – t – (m/n)h) + nv′(nt).
At t = 0, (23) is –∑mpmu′(yo – (m/n)h) + nv′(0), which (3) implies is positive.
Hence, t* must be positive, so it is determined by
(24) ∑mpmu′(yo – t – (m/n)h) = nv′(nt);
this equation has a unique solution since (22) is concave in t. Q. E. D.
2.4 Government relief. Let me now discuss why the expected utility of all
individuals can be raised if the government gives financial relief to accident
victims. Under the policy of no government relief just considered, the amount of
the public good, and hence its marginal utility to an individual, is fixed. This
implies that there should be an opportunity for the government to raise
individuals’ welfare by shifting funds from public goods to relief for accident
victims when there have been sufficiently many accidents, for then after receiving
their payments under optimal risk-sharing contracts, their wealth will still be
relatively low.
To amplify, suppose that
g(m) = payment made by the government to each accident victim when m
is the total number of accident victims; g(m) ≥ 0;
and assume that this payment is made regardless of any risk-sharing contract that
the individual has concluded. Since g(m) is paid to m individuals, the total
expense to the government is mg(m), so that the level of public goods supplied
will be nt – mg(m) in accident event m. When individuals make a risk-sharing

16

contract, they are assumed to know the government policy of relief. We have the
following result.
Proposition 3. There exists a policy of government relief for accident
victims that results in higher expected utility for all individuals than they enjoy
under the policy of no relief described in Proposition 2. Specifically, suppose that
the tax is the optimal tax t* under the policy of no relief and that positive relief is
given to accident victims for all accident events m where m is sufficiently high,
determined by (25) below, and where the amount of relief g(m) satisfies (26)
below. Then under the privately optimal risk-sharing contract, accident victims
will receive r*(m) = (1 – m/n)(h – g(m)) and individuals who are not victims will
pay x*(m) = (m/n)(h – g(m)). In addition, for all high m such that relief is given,
the utility of each individual will be higher than under the policy of no relief;
otherwise the utility of each individual will be the same as under the policy of no
relief.
Notes. The condition (25) showing when it is beneficial for the
government to reduce the amount of the public good and give relief is that the
marginal utility of relief, u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h), exceeds the social marginal utility of
the public good, nv′(nt*). As will be seen, this condition must sometimes be
satisfied because the tax t* is optimal given the policy of no relief.
The policy of government relief reduces the payments made to accident
victims due to private risk-sharing contracts. In particular, in the absence of
relief, an accident victim receives (1 – m/n)h, but given the policy of relief, he
receives (1 – m/n)(h – g(m)); hence he receives (1 – m/n)g(m) less through private
risk-sharing. Still, the total compensation of an accident victim rises by
(m/n)g(m) on account of the policy of relief.
Proof. Consider m for which
(25) u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) > nv′(nt*) = ∑mpmu′(yo – t* – (m/n)h);

17

this is a set of m above a threshold level since u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) is increasing in
m. Call this set G, as it will be the accident events for which the government will
give relief. Note that the probability of G must be positive: it was assumed that at
least two different accident events m occur with positive probability, implying
that u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) > ∑mpmu′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) must hold for at least one
accident event, namely, that with the highest m that has positive probability.
For each m in G, let g(m) be any positive g obeying
(26) u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h + (m/n)g) ≥ nv′(nt* – mg).
That there exist positive g obeying (26) follows from (25) and continuity of u′ and
v′ in their arguments. Under this policy in which, for m in G, g(m) > 0 obeys (26)
and g(m) = 0 for other m, I claim that individuals will be better off.
To establish this result, let us first solve for the optimal risk-sharing
contract given the government policy. Under a contract, the expected utility of
each person would be
(27) ∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t* – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t* – h + g(m) + r(m)) +
v(nt* – mg(m))].
The optimal contract maximizes (27) over x(m) and r(m) subject to (17), which is
equivalent to maximizing
(28) (1 – (m/n))u(yo – t* – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t* – h + g(m) + r(m))
for each m, subject to (17). 23 Substituting for (17), the problem is to maximize
(29) (1 – (m/n))u(yo – t* – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t* – h + g(m) + (n – m)x(m)/m)
over x(m) for each m. The first-order condition for the optimal x(m) is
(30) u′(yo – t* – x(m)) = u′(yo – t* – h + g(m) + (n – m)x(m)/m),
which implies that yo – t* – x(m) = yo – t* – h + g(m) + (n – m)x(m)/m, so that
x*(m) = (m/n)(h – g(m)) and thus that r*(m) = (1 – m/n)(h – g(m)). This also
implies that the final wealth of each individual will be yo – t* – (m/n)(h – g(m)).
23

Note that v(nt* – mg(m)) does not enter into (28) because the term does not depend on
the risk-sharing contract.

18

It follows from the above that the utility of each individual conditional on
the occurrence of an accident event m is
(31) u(yo – t* – (m/n)h + (m/n)g(m)) + v(nt* – mg(m)).
If m is not in G, then since g(m) = 0, (31) is u(yo – t* – (m/n)h) + v(nt*),
which is the utility in the absence of the policy of relief.
If m is in G, then since g(m) > 0, I claim that
(32) u(yo – t* – (m/n)h + (m/n)g(m)) + v(nt* – mg(m)) > u(yo – t* – (m/n)h) +
v(nt*),
meaning that utility is higher than in the absence of relief. This will prove the
claim that the policy of relief raises expected utility, for the probability of an m in
G is positive, as I showed above. Now to demonstrate (32), consider the function
(33) f(g) = u(yo – t* – (m/n)h + (m/n)g)) + v(nt* – mg).
We have
(34)

f′(g) = (m/n)[u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h + (m/n)g)) – nv′(nt* – mg)],

which is positive at g = 0 by (25), greater or equal to zero at g(m) by (26), and
must be positive in [0, g(m)) since f′′(g) < 0. Since f′(g) is positive in [0, g(m)),
we know that f(g(m)) > f(0), but this inequality is equivalent to (32). Q. E. D.
Although the government can improve on the best policy of no relief by
giving positive relief to accident victims whenever the number of accidents is
relatively high, such an adjusted policy cannot result in the first-best outcome.
That is because the optimal level of taxes t* under the policy of no relief is set to
maximize social welfare over the entire range of possible accidents states (see
(24)). Therefore, t* is too low to finance the first-best level of public goods when
the number of accidents is low. It would be in the collective interest of
individuals to alter taxes to cure this problem, and they can do so: If taxes are set
equal to the highest level that could possibly be needed for public goods, then the
first best outcome can in principle be achieved under an appropriate policy of
relief. In particular, we have

19

Proposition 4. Suppose that the tax is z*(0)/n and that the government
gives positive relief to accident victims in all accident events m ≥ 1, where the
relief is g(m) = (z*(0) – z*(m))/m. Then the optimal risk-sharing contract will be
x(m) = (m/n)(h – g(m)) and r(m) = ((1 – (m/n))(h – g(m)), the wealth of each
individual in accident state m will be yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h, and the first-best
outcome will be achieved.
Notes. The explanation for this result is that the tax revenues are nz*(0)/n
= z*(0), so support the optimal level of public goods if there are no accidents. If
there are a positive number m of accidents, the first-best level of public goods can
be achieved if the government reduces expenditures on public goods suitably;
first-best risk-sharing will then occur when the government distributes the savings
from the reduction in public goods expenditures to accident victims and optimal
contracts for risk-sharing are made.
Proof. If the tax is z*(0)/n and g(m) = (z*(0) – z*(m))/m for m ≥ 1, then
the level of public goods will be first-best for every m, since expenditures on
public goods will be
(35) z*(0) – mg(m) = z*(0) – m(z*(0) – z*(m))/m = z*(m).
Risk-sharing contracts will be x(m) = (m/n)(h – g(m)) and r(m) = ((1 – (m/n))(h –
g(m)) by the argument given in the proof of Proposition 3. Hence, the wealth of
each person in accident event m will be
(36) yo – t – (m/n)( h – g(m)) = yo – z*(0)/n – (m/n)(h – (z*(0) – z*(m))/m)
= yo – (m/n)h – z*(m))/n = y*(m).
Accordingly, the first-best outcome is achieved. Q. E. D.
2.5 Subsidy of private risk-sharing contracts. I now consider government
subsidy of risk-sharing contracts. Subsidization can be accomplished ex ante—by
the government giving a subsidy amount to each individual in period 1 that is
based on his risk-sharing contract. Subsidization can also be made ex post—by

20

the government adding to the payments made to accident victims in period 2 in a
way that depends on the risk-sharing contract.
Let us first examine ex ante subsidies. Assume that
s = subsidy amount paid in period 1 to an individual who makes a risk-sharing
contract,
In particular, let
σm = subsidy rate for the payment x(m) under the risk-sharing contract; σm ≥ 0;
and suppose that
(37)

s = ∑mσmpmx(m).

Hence, the ex ante subsidy is a weighted average of expected payments pmx(m)
made under the risk-sharing contract. Under an ex ante subsidy, the expected
utility of each individual will be
(38) ∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t + s – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t + s – h + r(m)) +
v(nt – ns)].
Note in (38) that since each person receives the subsidy s due to his risk-sharing
contract, the total expenditure of the government is ns, which reduces the amount
available for public goods. 24 We have
Proposition 5. An ex ante subsidy of risk-sharing contracts cannot
improve welfare over a policy of no government relief, but an ex ante subsidy can
lead to the same level of welfare.
Notes. The reason that an ex ante subsidy cannot raise welfare is that, for
welfare to be enhanced, government expenditures on public goods must be a
function of the number of accidents m, whereas this does not happen under a
subsidy paid in period 1. At best, then, an ex ante subsidy could lead to the same
level of welfare as that achievable under the policy of no relief when the tax is
optimally chosen. That the subsidy does lead to this level of welfare may at first
24

Expression (38) implicitly reflects the symmetry assumption, for ns is subtracted rather
than a sum of different subsidy amounts for different individuals.

21

seem counterintuitive because one might expect the subsidy to distort the sharing
of risk. Indeed, it is true that the subsidy usually distorts the sharing of risk. (As I
show in the proof, the subsidy results in an inefficient sharing of risk whenever M,
defined below, is unequal to nv′(nt – ns).) However, if the tax is chosen
appropriately, the subsidy will not turn out to distort risk-sharing, essentially
because the risk-sharing contract that is chosen by individuals is a collective
contract.
Proof. The risk-sharing contract that individuals choose maximizes (38)
over the x(m) subject to (17) and (37). From (38), it is clear that the public goods
expenditures are fixed and equal to nt – ns; they are not a function of the accident
event m. The government can achieve at least the level of welfare that is achieved
with the subsidy under a policy of no relief (and no subsidy) simply by setting the
tax equal to t – s. For then public expenditures will be nt – ns and the risk-sharing
accomplished by the contract individuals choose will be socially optimal given
the level of public expenditures, by the logic of Proposition 2.
To show that it is possible using a subsidy to achieve the level of welfare
possible under no relief when taxes are optimally set at t* as described in
Proposition 2, let me first consider the determination of the privately optimal risksharing contract given the subsidy. Making use of (18), the contract is obtained
by maximizing
(39) ∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t + s – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t + s – h +
[(n – m)/m]x(m))] + v(nt – ns)
over the x(m) subject to (37). The derivative of (39) with respect to a particular
x(m), which I will call x(j) here, is
(40) pj{– (1 – (j/n))u′(yo – t + s – x(j)) + [(n – j)/j](j/n)u′(yo – t + s – h + [(n –
j)/j]x(j))} + σjpj∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u′(yo – t + s – x(m)) + (m/n)u′(yo – t + s –
h + [(n – m)/m]x(m))] – nσjpjv′(nt – ns).

22

The first term in (40) is the direct effect of increasing x(j) on expected utility in
the accident event j; the second term is the income effect due to the increase in the
subsidy; and the third term is the reduction in public goods due to the expenditure
on the subsidy. Setting the expression in (40) equal to zero and dividing by pj
gives the first-order condition
(41) [(n – j)/j](j/n)u′(yo – t + s – h + [(n – j)/j]x(j)) + σj(M – nv′(nt – ns))
= (1 – (j/n))u′(yo – t + s – x(j)),
where M stands for ∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u′(yo – t + s – x(m)) + (m/n)u′(yo – t + s –
h + [(n – m)/m]x(m))], the expected marginal utility of income. Condition (41)
simplifies to
(42) u′(yo – t + s – h + [(n – j)/j]x(j)) + σj[n/(n – j)](M – nv′(nt – ns)) = u′(yo – t
+ s – x(j)).
Note therefore the significance of the sign of (M – nv′(nt – ns)), the expected
marginal utility of income minus the social marginal utility from public goods. If
M > nv′(nt – ns), then u’(yo – t + s – h + [(n – j)/j]x(j)) < u’(yo – t + s – x(j)), so
that yo – t + s – h + [(n – j)/j]x(j) > yo – t + s – x(j); if M < nv′(nt – ns), then yo –
t + s – h + [(n – j)/j]x(j) < yo – t + s – x(j); and if M = nv′(nt – ns), then yo – t +
s – h + [(n – j)/j]x(j) = yo – t + s – x(j).
Now to demonstrate the claim, let
(43) s* = ∑mσmpm(m/n)h
for any subsidy scheme of the σm. This is the subsidy payment that a person would
receive if he made the optimal risk-sharing contract in the absence of relief, for
from Proposition 2 we know that x*(m) = (m/n)h. Let the tax be
(44) t** = t* + s*,
where t* is the optimal tax in Proposition 2. I assert that given t**, the same
outcome described in Proposition 2 will be implemented under the subsidy
scheme. This follows immediately from two observations: (i) If the risk-sharing
contract chosen by individuals is x*(m) = (m/n)h, then by (43) and (44), public

23

goods expenditures must be nt** – ns* = nt* and the outcome in Proposition 2
will thus be achieved. (ii) The risk-sharing contract chosen by individuals will be
x*(m), for when public goods expenditures are nt*, equation (24) must hold. In
particular, (24) states that ∑mpmu′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) = nv′(nt*). Accordingly, if
x(m) = (m/n)h, then the first-order condition (42) will be satisfied at x(m) =
(m/n)h, for then (24) means that M = nv′(nt** – ns*) = nv′(nt*). Q. E. D.
Next consider ex post subsidies of risk-sharing contracts. Under an ex
post subsidy, I assume that if m accidents occur, the government adds σm dollars
to each dollar paid under a risk-sharing contract by those who are not accident
victims. Hence, the extra amount received by each accident victim is
(45) σm(n – m)x(m)/m
and the expenditure of the government on the subsidy is
(46) σm(n – m)x(m).
Thus, an ex post subsidy resembles government relief to accident victims,
suggesting that such a subsidy can improve welfare over a policy of no relief.
The two propositions that follow validate this intuition.
Proposition 6. An ex post subsidy of risk-sharing contracts can improve
welfare over a policy of no government relief. In particular, suppose that the tax
is the optimal tax t* under the policy of no relief. Then a welfare-improving ex
post subsidy scheme exists involving a positive subsidy for accident events m
where m is sufficiently high, determined by (25), as in Proposition 3.
Notes. The logic underlying this conclusion is similar to that of
Proposition 3. Namely, when m obeys (25), the marginal utility of income
exceeds the social marginal utility of the public good, implying that a reduction in
public goods accomplished by a subsidy will be socially beneficial, other things
being equal. A complication arises, however, because subsidies tend to distort
risk-sharing. Nevertheless, as will be indicated, the first-order welfare loss due to

24

the subsidy-related distortion is zero when the subsidy begins to be applied, so
that a sufficiently small subsidy will raise welfare.
Proof. Given the definition of ex post subsidies, the expected utility of an
individual is
(47) ∑mpm[(1 – (m/n))u(yo – t – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t – h + (1 + σm)[(n –
m)/m]x(m)) + v(nt – σm(n – m)x(m))],
The optimal contract maximizes (47) over the x(m). Since the choice of x(m)
affects only the mth term in (47), the problem of maximizing (47) over the x(m)
reduces to maximizing
(48) (1 – (m/n))u(yo – t – x(m)) + (m/n)u(yo – t – h + (1 + σm)[(n – m)/m]x(m)) +
v(nt – σm(n – m)x(m)).
over x(m) for each m individually. For convenience, let me write x(m) in (48) as x
and take its derivative with respect to x to obtain,
(49) –(1 – (m/n))u′(yo – t – x) + (1 + σm)[(n – m)/m](m/n)u′(yo – t – h + (1 +
σm)[(n – m)/m]x) – σm(n – m)v′(nt – σm(n – m)x).
The first-order condition determining x is thus
(50) (1 + σm)[(n – m)/m](m/n)u′(yo – t – h + (1 + σm)[(n – m)/m]x)
= (1 – (m/n))u′(yo – t – x) + σm(n – m)v′(nt – σm(n – m)x),
or, after simplification,
(51) u′(yo – t – h + (1 + σm)[(n – m)/m]x) = u′(yo – t – x)
+ σm[nv′(nt – σm(n – m)x) – u′(yo – t – h + (1 + σm)[(n – m)/m]x)].
Now suppose that t = t*, the optimal tax under the no relief policy, as
determined in Proposition 2. Choose an m sufficiently high that it is in the set G
described in Proposition 3; hence
(52) u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) > nv′(nt*).
I claim that for this m, there exists a positive σm such that the subsidy policy with
this σm and all other σi equal to 0 results in higher welfare than the policy of no
relief. Showing this claim will obviously demonstrate that some ex post subsidy

25

policy dominates the policy of no relief. To prove the claim, it will suffice to
show that the derivative of (48) with respect to σm is positive when evaluated at σm
= 0, for all the terms in expected utility other than the mth are the same as those
under the policy of no relief since the σi are 0 for i ≠ m. Let me rewrite (48) as
follows.
(53) ω(x(σ), σ) = (1 – (m/n))u(yo – t* – x(σ)) + (m/n)u(yo – t* – h
+ (1 + σ)[(n – m)/m]x(σ)) + v(nt* – σ(n – m)x(σ)),
where ω stands for welfare when m accidents occur, σ stands for σm, and x(σ)
stands for x(m), which is a function of σm determined implicitly by (51). The
derivative of (53) with respect to σ is
(54) –x′(σ)(1 – (m/n))u′(yo – t* – x(σ))
+ (m/n)(1 + σ)[(n – m)/m]x′(σ)u′(yo – t* – h + (1 + σ)[(n – m)/m]x(σ))
+ (m/n)[(n – m)/m]x(σ)u′(yo – t* – h + (1 + σ)[(n – m)/m]x(σ))
–(n – m)x(σ)v′(nt* – σ(n – m)x(σ)) – σ(n – m)x′(σ)v′(nt* – σ(n – m)x(σ)).
Now at σ = 0, (54) is
(55) –x′(0)(1 – (m/n))u′(yo – t* – x(0))
+ (m/n)[(n – m)/m]x′(0)u′(yo – t* – h + [(n – m)/m]x(0))
+ (m/n)[(n – m)/m]x(0)u′(yo – t* – h + [(n – m)/m]x(0)) – (n – m)x(0)v′(nt*).
But at σ = 0, we know that since there is no subsidy, the risk-sharing contract is
such that x(m) = (m/n)h and the wealth of both those who suffer from accidents
and those who do not is yo – t* – (m/n)h. Hence (55) reduces to
(56) –x′(0)(1 – (m/n))u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) + (m/n)[(n – m)/m]x′(0)u′(yo – t*
– (m/n)h) + (m/n)[(n – m)/m](m/n)hu′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) – (n – m)(m/n)hv′(nt*)
= [(n – m)/n](m/n)hu′(yo – t* – (m/n)h) – (n – m)(m/n)hv′(nt*)
= [(n - m)m/n]h[u′(yo – t* – (m/n)h)/n – v′(nt*)].
The last expression must be positive, due to (52), which completes the proof.
What was shown, that the derivative of ω(x(σ), σ) with respect to σ is positive
when evaluated at 0 may be understood as follows. The derivative equals ωx(x(σ),

26

σ)x′(σ) + ωσ(x(σ), σ). But ωx(x(σ), σ) must be zero: it is the effect on expected
utility given m of transferring wealth from nonvictims to victims starting from the
optimal contract when there is no subsidy; and under that optimal contract, wealth
for nonvictims and victims is the same, meaning that there is no first-order effect
from transferring additional wealth between them. Hence, the derivative reduces
to ωσ(x(σ), σ), the direct effect of the subsidy, which is to shift wealth from public
goods expenditures to individuals. Since m is high, in the set G guaranteeing
(52), this must be beneficial. Q. E. D.
Finally, let me show that the first-best outcome can be achieved under a
subsidy policy if the tax is raised from t*, the optimal tax under the policy of no
relief, to the level sufficiently high to allow the ideal level of public goods if there
are no accidents.
Proposition 7. Suppose that the tax is z*(0)/n. Then there exists an ex
post subsidy policy under which the first-best outcome will be achieved.
Notes. This explanation for this result is similar to that for Proposition 4.
If the tax is as stated, then tax revenues are z*(0), so the optimal level of public
goods will be supplied if there are no accidents. If there are a positive number m
of accidents, the first-best level of public goods will be achieved if the
government reduces expenditures on public goods appropriately, which will
happen if its positive subsidy rate is chosen to accomplish that objective.
However, when the subsidy rate is positive, one might expect risk-sharing to be
distorted, preventing achievement of the first-best outcome. As the proof shows,
though, risk-sharing turns out not to be distorted if the subsidy policy is chosen
optimally.
Proof. Assume that the tax t is z*(0)/n. Then when m = 0, the first-best
outcome will be achieved. Now suppose that, for any positive m, we have
(57)

σm(n – m)x(m) = z*(0) – z*(m).

27

Then public goods will be first-best given m, since the left-hand side is
government expenditures on the subsidy, which will reduce government
expenditures on public goods from z*(0) to z*(m).
Suppose also that σm and x(m) are such that
(58)

yo – z*(0)/n – x(m) = yo – z*(0)/n – h + [(n – m)/m](1 + σm)x(m).

This means that nonaccident victims have the same wealth as accident victims,
and thus that risk-sharing will also be first-best. Hence, if I can show that there
exist σm and x(m) satisfying (57) and (58) and that x(m) will also be chosen by
individuals—which is to say, that x(m) satisfies the first-order condition (51) —I
will have demonstrated that the first-best outcome can be achieved under an ex
post subsidy.
Note first that (57) and (58) imply that
(59)

yo – z*(0)/n – x(m) = yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h.

This must be true, for (57) implies that the total wealth available for individuals to
consume is nyo – z*(m) – mh, which means that the per person wealth for
consumption is yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h, and (58) implies that each person must
consume this amount.
Now to show that (51), will be satisfied, observe that (57) and (59) imply
that (51) reduces to nv′(z*(m)) – u′(yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h) = 0, and this must hold
by (9).
It remains to show that there exist positive σm and x(m) obeying (57) and
(58). Solving them, we find that
(60) x(m) = (mh – (z*(0) – z*(m))/n,
(61) σm = n(z*(0) – z*(m))/[(n – m)(mh – (z*(0) – z*(m)).
These are both positive, for (15) implies that z*(0) – z*(m) < mh. Q. E. D.
2.6 Adjustment of taxes. To this point, I have discussed how government
relief for accident victims and subsidy of risk-sharing contracts can be employed

28

to raise social welfare. Another way for the government to raise social welfare is
to reduce the tax as the number of accidents increases.
Proposition 8. Suppose that the tax is imposed at time 2 and equals
z*(m)/n—or equivalently that the tax is imposed at time 1 but is adjusted at time
2, through a surtax or a credit, such that the final tax is z*(m)/n. Then the risksharing contract will be x(m) = (m/n)h and r(m) = ((1 – (m/n))h, the wealth of each
individual in accident event m will be yo – z*(m)/n – (m/n)h, and the first-best
outcome will be achieved.
Notes. It is evident that there is no need for relief or subsidy of risksharing if taxes depend on the number of accidents, for such adjustment of taxes
allows the level of wealth available for consumption to be a function of the
number of accidents, and privately-optimal risk sharing then results in the socially
best outcome.
Proof. The tax results in the first-best level of the public good in each
accident event m by assumption. That the risk-sharing contract is as claimed
follows essentially from the proof of Proposition 2. Hence, the first-best outcome
is achieved. Q. E. D.

3. Concluding Remarks
To recapitulate, it was shown in the world of a simple model that the
government can raise social welfare by giving aid when substantial, especially
correlated, adverse outcomes occur. The reason was that privately optimal risksharing does not lead to full protection against large risks, whereas the
government can divert resources from provision of public goods to relief for
victims of adverse outcomes.
Three methods of government support were beneficial. One was direct
relief to accident victims. A second was ex post subsidy of risk-sharing
arrangements (such as federal participation in the coverage of flood insurance

29

claims 25). Ex ante subsidy of risk-sharing agreements (illustrated by the
earthquake insurance program in California 26), however, was not socially
advantageous because it does not lead to the shifting of government-controlled
resources to individuals as a function of the extent of accident losses. The third
type of beneficial aid was income tax adjustment in the light of accidents. 27
These three forms of government help were equivalent in the sense that they
could each be employed to achieve first-best outcomes.
However, these types of government aid would not be equivalent
in the face of a number of factors that were not reflected in the model. For
example, the factor of moral hazard might be addressed better by a tailored
government-supported insurance program than by direct government relief or tax
adjustment. Conversely, problems stemming from the underestimation of risks
might be better met by direct relief or tax adjustment, as these forms of
government aid do not depend on the accuracy of individuals’ perceptions of risk.

The federal flood insurance program involves both ex post subsidy, in that it can resort
to borrowing from the Treasury, and ex ante subsidy of premiums. See FEMA (2002), pp. 22-28.
26

The insurance offered under the auspices of the California Earthquake Authority
incorporates an implicit ex ante subsidy of premiums because the Authority does not pay taxes.
However, the program of the Authority does not reflect an ex post subsidy in that it cannot draw
on the state’s funds if its assets are not sufficient to pay the claims made in a large earthquake.

The income tax system in fact has a feature that gives relief from accident losses:
casualty losses may be deducted from taxable income. However, the casualty loss deduction is not
conditioned on whether the losses are correlated (and thus not on the availability or price of
insurance coverage).
