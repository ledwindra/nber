    "abstract": "\n\nI use data on 180 sovereign defaults to analyze what determines the recovery rate after a debt restructuring process. Why do creditors recover, in some cases, more than 90%, while in other cases they recover less than 10%? I find support for the Grossman and Van Huyk model of \u201cexcusable defaults\u201d: countries that experience more severe negative shocks tend to have higher \u201chaircuts\u201d than countries that face less severe shocks. I discuss in detail debt restructuring episodes in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Greece. The results suggest that the haircut imposed by Argentina in its 2005 restructuring (75%) was \u201cexcessively high.\u201d The other episodes\u2019 haircuts are consistent with the model.\n\n",
