Renewable Energy Policies and Technological Innovation:
Evidence Based on Patent Counts

I. Introduction
Investment in renewable energy sources – wind, solar, geothermal, ocean, biomass, and waste – can
significantly contribute to the realization of public environmental objectives. In addition, it is
sometimes argued that increased shares of renewable energy contribute to other public policy
objectives, such as greater energy security in the face of uncertain markets for fossil fuels.
Currently, the penetration of renewables, although increasing, remains limited. In the absence
of public intervention favoring their development, production costs remain higher than for substitute
fossil fuels. Various government policies have been introduced in an effort to reduce costs and
accelerate market penetration, such as feed-in tariffs, production quotas, and tax credits. While it is
hoped that these policies will stimulate innovation in renewable energy, the relative effectiveness of
alternative policies for encouraging innovation has yet to be tested empirically. As such, renewable
energy is an interesting context in which to assess the effect of different types of policy measures on
technological innovation.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA 2006a) three generations of renewable
energy technologies can be distinguished: (i) First-generation technologies which have already
reached maturity, such as hydropower, biomass combustion, and geothermal energy; (ii) Secondgeneration technologies which are undergoing rapid development such as solar energy, wind power,
and modern forms of bio-energy; and (iii) Third-generation technologies which are presently in
developmental stages such as concentrating solar power, ocean energy, improved geothermal, and
integrated bio-energy systems.
The contribution of different renewable energy sources to total energy supply remains limited.
In 2004, among the three main regions of the OECD, Europe had the highest share of renewable use
in total energy production (6.9%). In North America (Canada, United States and Mexico) the figure is
5.7% and for OECD Pacific (Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand) it is 3.4% (IEA 2006b). Solid
biomass is the single largest source of renewable energy supply (44.6%) followed by hydropower

(34.6%). The rate of growth of renewable energy supply amongst the OECD countries between 1990
and 2004 has been particularly strong for wind power (23.9% annually, on average), combustible
renewables and waste excluding solid biomass (i.e. renewable municipal waste, biogas, liquid
biomass) (12.3%), and solar energy (incl. solar thermal and solar photovoltaic) (5.7%) (IEA 2006b).
However, the relative importance of slow-growing renewables, such as solid biomass (1.6%),
hydropower (0.6%) and geothermal (0.2%), means that the overall rate of growth of renewables
(1.3%) is marginally below the growth rate of total primary energy supply (TPES) (1.4%).
In order to increase the share of renewable sources in total energy supply, many governments
have sought to encourage further development and adoption of renewable energy technologies (see
IEA 2004). For instance, a European Union Directive of 2001 (Directive 2001/77/EC) provides a
framework for the development of renewable energies in Europe. In March 2007 EU heads of state
have agreed to set a binding target for renewable energy use at 20 percent of the EU's total energy
needs by 2020. In the United States, federal tax credits for renewable energy were extended in 2006,
granting production tax credits for bio-energy, geothermal, wind, solar, and other renewable energy
sources (US DOE 2007).
In addition to production tax credits, other measures introduced in different countries include
mandatory production quotas, differentiated tariff systems, and tradable certificates.1 With the
exception of support for research and development, most policies which have been introduced do not
provide explicit support for technological innovation. However, by either decreasing the relative price
of the use of renewable energy relative to fossil fuels, or by increasing demand for electricity
generated from renewable sources, such policy measures will provide increased returns on the
identification of more efficient forms of electricity generation using renewable energy sources.
There is some limited empirical evidence to support the more general finding that
environmental policies lead to innovation, as reflected in increased patent activity (see Jaffe, Newell
and Stavins (2002) for a review of the empirical literature). For instance, Lanjouw and Mody (1996)

1

examined the relationship between the number of patents granted and environmental policy
stringency, measured in terms of pollution abatement expenditures at the macroeconomic level for
Japan, US, and Germany. They found that pollution abatement cost affects the number of patents
successfully granted with 1- to 2-year lag. Using US industry-level data, Jaffe and Palmer (1997)
extended Lanjouw and Mody‟s study by incorporating various factors that potentially affect
environmental innovation. The study did not support the hypothesis that the number of patents
increased in response to environmental regulation. Brunnermeier and Cohen (2003) used US
manufacturing industry data and empirically analyzed factors that determined environmental
technological innovation. They found that counts of environment-related patents increase as pollution
abatement expenditures increase. Moreover, they found that international competition stimulates
environmental innovation.
Very few studies have examined the role of policy instrument choice. Using patent data, Popp
(2003) examined the effects of the introduction of the tradable permit system for SO2 emissions as
part of US Clean Air Act Amendments. Comparing patent applications following the introduction of
the tradable permit scheme with those submitted under the previous technology-based regulatory
system, he found evidence of the improved removal efficiency of scrubbers. A later paper by Popp
(2006) looks at the experience of the US, Japan and Germany with respect to patents for SO2 and NOx
abatement technologies. He found: (a) a strong influence of „home bias‟ in the effect of domestic
environmental regulations on patenting; but, also (b) an important role played by foreign innovation in
the development of such patents.
In one of the few cross-country studies, De Vries and Withagen (2005) investigated the
relationship between environmental policy regarding SO2 and patent applications in relevant patent
classifications. Applying three different models which vary according to the manner in which policy
stringency is modeled, they found some evidence that strict environmental policies lead to more
innovation. However, they recognize that the modeling of environmental policy in their analysis
requires further refinement. Moreover, they expressed concerns about their ability to identify all
relevant patent classes.

2

In this paper, we examine innovations for renewable energy, using a panel data set comprised
of 25 countries and 26 years. The case is interesting for a number of reasons. First, the study
contributes to the literature in that it has a cross-country focus. As noted, the studies by Popp (2006)
and de Vries and Withagen (2005) are the only cross-country studies available. Most importantly, this
cross-country focus allows us to examine the effects of a wide variety of policy types, including feedin tariffs, production quotas, and investment subsidies. Third, we study patent activity with respect to
a number of different sources of renewable energy (wind, solar, ocean, geothermal, biomass, wasteto-energy), allowing us to observe how the effectiveness of different policy types varies by
technology. For instance, encouraging innovation in solar power, which has high costs and is rarely
competitive with existing power sources, might require a different set of policy instruments than
would be needed to encourage innovation in wind power.
The next section presents the principal hypotheses tested in this paper. The third section
presents the data used in the analysis, including data on patents with respect to renewable energy
technologies, as well as data on public policy measures and other relevant explanatory variables. The
fourth section presents the model specification and empirical results. The paper concludes with a
summary of the main results.

II. Principal hypotheses
Our goal in this paper is to test the effect of various renewable energy policies on innovation. While
the broad notion that environmental policies encourage innovation is well-documented, previous
attempts which assess policy types focus on broad categories of policies (e.g. market-based policies
versus command and control regulation). However, within these broad categories lie several policy
variants, such as price supports, tax credits, and renewable energy mandates, all of which are likely to
have different effects on renewable energy innovation.
Our study focuses on high-income countries, many of which have adopted policies to
encourage the development of renewable energy. First, in the 1970s, a number of countries introduced
support for R&D. This was followed by investment incentives (third-party financing, investment

3

guarantees), taxes (exemptions, rebates), and price-support policies (tariffs, guaranteed prices). More
recently, a number of countries have introduced quantity obligations, often followed by certificates in
which the obligations are tradable across generators (IEA 2004).
Given differences in cost structures and level of maturity for different renewable energy
sources it is likely that the effects of policy measures will vary by energy source. For instance,
investment grants might be particularly effective in inducing innovation for renewable energy sources
with high fixed costs per kWh. The inherent riskiness of investments in inventive activities and the
skewed nature of potential returns mean that lenders may have diﬃculty assessing potential
investments in R&D (Jaumotte and Pain 2005). Under such conditions, policies which improve access
to capital may be particularly important for renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics, ocean
energy and waste-to-energy, which have high up-front fixed costs.
In addition, while in theory price-based measures (e.g. feed-in tariffs) and quantity-based
measures (e.g. production quotas) with equivalent environmental objectives should have equal effects
on innovation, this may not be the case in practice. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with
the early stages of technological development, production quotas which guarantee a market might be
more effective in inducing innovation for renewable energy sources in which technologies are less
mature such as concentrating solar and integrated bio-energy systems. Conversely, price-based
policies (such as feed-in tariffs) may be more effective for sources where technologies have reached
or are approaching competitiveness with fossil fuel sources, such as wind, biomass and geothermal
energy (IEA 2004).
And finally, evidence has shown that the effectiveness of „voluntary‟ environmental policy
measures depends significantly on the nature and scope of sanctions associated with „non-compliance‟
(Morgenstern and Pizer 2007). This will depend, in part, upon the institutional and market
characteristics of the regulated entities. In the case of electricity supply the regulated firms are subject
to both economic (and not just environmental) regulation, increasing the potential for governments to
impose sanctions should the objectives of voluntary approaches not be met.

4

Perhaps more

significantly, many firms remain in public hands, reducing the need for the introduction of mandatory
regulations in order to meet given policy objectives.
In addition to the influence of policy, we control for a number of other factors that are likely
to affect incentives for innovation. First and foremost, renewable energy sources are primarily used as
intermediate inputs into the production of electricity, which are substitutable with fossil fuels. Based
on the induced innovation literature (e.g., Binswanger 1974) relative prices of alternative factor inputs
are clearly an important determinant of innovation. Therefore, with rising prices of fossil fuels, there
will be incentives to innovate with respect to the generation of electricity from renewable energy
sources.
Schmookler (1966) emphasized the role of demand factors in inducing innovation. As with
any activity, R&D is likely to be responsive to profit-making opportunities. As such, with growing
markets, the potential to recoup investments will increase. Moreover, due to the „serendipitous‟ nature
of successful inventive activity, a large market will increase the potential for inventive talent to
identify solutions to a given problem (Popp 2006; Scherer and Harhoff 2000). For these reasons
successful innovation is more likely in dynamic sectors in fast-growing economies. In the case of
renewable energy, fast-growing markets can be identified by growing electricity consumption.
On the supply-side, general scientific capacity (scientific personnel, resources, etc.) is likely
to have an important influence on inventive activity in general. Moreover, the propensity of inventors
to patent the results of inventive activity is likely to vary across countries and change over time within
countries, both because different strategies may be adopted to capture the rents from innovation and
because legal conditions may differ across countries and change through time (Jaumotte and Pain
2005). It is, therefore, important to capture the effects of these two factors in the specific case of
renewable energy.

III. Data
A. Patent applications
Given the importance of technological innovation in modern economies, identifying reliable measures
of technological innovation has long preoccupied economists. However, there are still very few such
measures available. Many potential candidates (e.g. research and development expenditures, number
of scientific personnel, etc.) are at best imperfect indicators of the innovative performance of an
economy since they focus on inputs.
In this context patents, as an output measure, have emerged as a valuable source of
information, reflecting the innovative performance of a firm or an economy in a manner which is
attractive to researchers (Griliches 1990). Patent applications provide a wealth of information on the
nature of the invention and the applicant. The data is both readily available (if not always in a
convenient format), discrete (and thus easily subject to statistical analysis), and can be disaggregated
to specific technological areas. Significantly, there are very few examples of economically significant
inventions which have not been patented (Dernis and Guellec 2001; Dernis and Kahn 2004).
Patents, issued by national patent offices (usually specialized agencies), give the holder the
right to exclude others from the production of a specific good (or from using a specific process) for a
defined number of years, which may vary depending upon the nature of the innovation. In order to be
eligible for a patent, the innovation must be novel, involve a non-obvious inventive step, and be
commercially viable (Dernis and Guellec 2001; Dernis and Kahn 2004).
However, patents are an imperfect measure of technological innovation for a variety of
reasons: (a) It is difficult to distinguish between the „value‟ of different patents on the basis of patent
applications. Most clearly, the use of unweighted patent counts would attribute the same importance
to patents for which there were no successful commercial applications with those which are highly
profitable; (b) There is variation in the propensity to patent across countries and sectors. This is due in
part to the level of protection afforded by the patent, but also to the possibility of protecting monopoly
rights by other means depending upon market conditions; and, (c) Differences in patent regimes
across countries mean that it is difficult to be certain that one is comparing „like with like‟. For

6

instance, some countries would require multiple patents for the same innovation which could be
covered by a single patent in other countries. Fortunately, we can control for these country-specific
differences in the regressions that follow. Moreover, by focusing on differences in patenting trends
across time, Griliches (1990) shows that patents, sorted by their year of application, are strongly
correlated with R&D spending, and thus make a good proxy for innovative activity.
Despite their shortcomings, patent counts are still the best available source of data on
innovation which is readily available and comparable across countries. Relevant patents in different
subject areas can be identified using the International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, developed at
the World Intellectual Property Organisation. This classification system is a hierarchy of codes,
structured into different levels. Table 1 gives an idea of the hierarchical structure, taking the example
of solar concentrating devices used for the generation of mechanical power. While other classification
systems (e.g., commodity or sectoral classifications) may be suitable to study innovation in general,
the advantage of the IPC classification is that it is application-based – and thus facilitates
identification of „environmentally-relevant‟ technology classes.
Based upon an extensive literature review of technology developments in the area of
renewable energy, a set of keywords were identified for this study. These were used to determine
appropriate IPC codes which relate directly to renewable energy in the areas of wind, solar,
geothermal, ocean, biomass, and waste (the complete list of the relevant codes and their definitions is
included in the Appendix). Two possible types of error are possible when searching for relevant
patents – inclusion of irrelevant patents and exclusion of relevant patents from the selected
classifications. In contrast to some other „environmental‟ technologies, renewable energy technologies
have the advantage that these types of errors are largely minimized because the definition of the
relevant patent classifications allows easy identification of the relevant patents.

7

Patent counts were generated for each of the IPC classifications using the OECD Patent
Database (OECD 2007).2 Only patent applications deposited at the European Patent Office (EPO)
were included. Through the EPO, the applicant designates as many of the EPO member states for
protection as it desires, rather than applying to individual European patent offices among the 32
contributing countries. If the application is successful, the patent is transferred to the individual
national patent offices designated for protection in the application. Given that EPO applications are
more expensive than applications to national patent offices, inventors typically first file a patent
application in their home country, and then apply to the EPO if they desire protection in multiple
European countries. However, costs will be much lower by filing with the EPO than if individual
applications are made to each country (see Popp 2005). For the purpose of this paper, the EPO data is
thus superior to data from national patent offices because the difference in costs provides a quality
hurdle which eliminates applications for low-value inventions.
Counts were obtained for all major patenting countries, including non-European countries.
While the European market is significant, it is still expected that there will be some bias toward
applications from European inventors (see Dernis and Guellec 2001). In the empirical analysis
undertaken in this study this bias is addressed through the inclusion of both country fixed effects and a
control variable reflecting data on total EPO applications for all technology areas.
Figure 1 shows the total number of patent applications for six renewable energy sources.
Geothermal applications fell off dramatically after the late 1970s, while there has been continuous
growth in patenting for solar power technologies. Wind power and waste-to-energy exhibit even more
rapid growth, particularly since the mid-1990s. There are relatively few patents for ocean and biomass
energy, but they have been also increasing.3

collection of the data is gratefully acknowledged.

Interestingly, EPO applications for patents in total increased approximately ten-fold over the period

in question, while patents for renewables increased just over four-fold. However, in recent years the

8

Figure 2 compares total patent applications for a selection of OECD countries which have
exhibited significant levels of innovation. Germany has the highest number of patents, but relative to
the US and Japan, this partly reflects the „home bias‟ in EPO applications. France and the UK both
have at least 200 patent applications over the period.
In addition to these countries, there are specific areas in which individual countries have been
important innovators for specific renewables. In addition to Germany, Japan and the US (countries
which are consistently important for most renewables), other significant innovators for particular
sources have included Denmark (wind), Switzerland (solar, geothermal), France (geothermal,
biomass, waste), the UK (ocean, biomass and waste), Italy (ocean), Netherlands (wind), and Sweden
(ocean).
However, a comparison of patenting activity across countries needs to account for relative
differences in the size of countries‟ economies. In Table 2, the counts are weighted by country‟s GDP
to yield a measure of patent intensity. On this basis, a number of smaller countries such as Denmark,
Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden achieve the highest innovation output per unit of GDP. Of the three
countries which have the highest absolute counts, only Germany continues to rank consistently in the
top five. Japan and the US remain first and third among non-EPO countries, with Australia second.
And finally, differences in general propensity to patent may also affect country‟s innovative
output through its effect on direction of innovation. Since national environmental policies generally
complement innovation policies (IPR regimes, etc.), differences in levels of patents across countries
may be due to innovation policy, rather than environmental policy. While we control for such effects
in our regression analysis, in Table 3 we simply normalize patent counts by the volume of a country‟s
patenting activity overall (in all technological areas). On this basis, countries such as Denmark, Spain,
Australia, Austria and Norway achieve the highest innovation output in renewables. Moreover,

rate of growth in the area of renewables has been higher than the rate of growth of total EPO
applications.

9

several non-EPO countries achieve relatively high innovation output, with Australia, Taiwan and
Canada leading the group.

B. Public policy measures
In this paper, a database of public policies aimed at developing renewable energy sources compiled at
the International Energy Agency (IEA) was used to construct alternative policy indicators. Figure 3
provides a graphical representation of the introduction of alternative policy types in various countries
(IEA 2004). Each point on the scatter plot represents the year in which a significant example of a
particular type of policy instrument was first introduced in that particular country. Six different policy
types are distinguished: R&D; investment incentives (e.g. risk guarantees, grants, low-interest loans);
tax incentives (e.g. accelerated depreciation); tariff incentives (e.g. feed-in tariffs); voluntary
programs; obligations (e.g. guaranteed markets, production quotas); and, tradable certificates.
Figure 4 gives a first descriptive indication of the relative importance of public policy factors
on patenting (total renewable energy patent applications) in selected countries. There is no obvious
correlation between the introduction of different policies and 'spikes' in patent activity, except perhaps
the introduction of tariffs in Germany (with some lag), obligations and taxes in Denmark, and
investment credits in Japan.
Unfortunately due to the heterogeneous nature of the data, it is not possible to construct
continuous variables in which the level of „stringency‟ (or „support‟) is commensurable across policy
types and countries. As such, for most of the policy types dummy variables are introduced to capture
the effect of the implementation of different policies. First, binary variables are constructed for the
different policy types, including R&D support, tax measures, investment incentives, differentiated
tariffs, voluntary programs, quantity obligations, and tradable certificates. The variables take on a
value of 0 prior to introduction of the policy, and 1 thereafter. Second, cluster analysis is applied to
construct clusters of policy instruments based upon the policy dummies described above. Third,
principal component analysis is applied to construct a composite policy variable. These policy

10

variables provide a representation of environmental policy framework which is useful for studying the
effects of instrument choice on innovation.
This treatment of public policy influences complements the range of measures used
previously to reflect regulatory stringency (e.g., pollution abatement and control expenditures,
inspection frequency, etc.). However, it is recognized that this does not capture differences in relative
stringency (or support) provided by different measures.
One exception is the case of energy R&D. The IEA‟s Energy Technology Research and
Development Database (IEA 2006c) collects data on national public sector expenditures on R&D
disaggregated by type of renewable energy. Thus, for public R&D support, we are able to include data
on the magnitude, as well as the existence, of support. The sign on this variable is expected to be
positive.

C. Other explanatory variables
As noted, returns on innovation are affected by the potential market for this innovation. In the case of
renewable energy this is best reflected in trends for electricity consumption. A growing market for
electricity should increase incentives to innovate with respect to renewable energy technologies. Data
on household and industry sector electricity consumption was obtained from the IEA‟s Energy
Balances Database (IEA 2006d).
Consistent with the „induced innovation‟ hypothesis, the commercial viability of renewable
energy is dependent in large part upon the its cost, relative to substitute factor inputs. Since the costs
of electricity production using renewable energy sources are generally greater than for fossil fuels, an
increase in the price of electricity should increase incentives for innovation in the area of renewable
energies. Since renewable sources represent a relatively small proportion of total electricity
generation, it is assumed that the price of electricity can be considered exogenous. Data on residential
and industry end-user prices was obtained from IEA‟s Energy Prices and Taxes Database (IEA
2006e). The electricity price variable was constructed by weighting price indices for residential and
industrial use by consumption levels. The sign is expected to be positive.

11

Differences in both scientific capacity and the propensity to patent across countries and time
are captured through the use of a variable which reflects overall EPO patent applications filed across
the whole spectrum of technological areas (OECD 2007). In addition, inventors from non-European
countries are less likely to patent at the EPO (home bias). This variable thus serves as a „trend‟
variable in that it controls for the changes in general propensity to patent over time and across
countries. The sign is expected to be positive. Table 4 provides basic descriptive statistics for the
policy dummies and other explanatory variables.

IV. Model specification and empirical results
A. Model specification
In order to test the hypotheses set out in Section 2 above, the following reduced-form equation is
specified:

where i = 1,…,25 indexes the cross-sectional unit (country) and t = 1978,…,2003 indexes time. The
dependent variable, patenting activity, is measured by the number of patent applications in each of the
technological areas of renewable energy (wind, solar, geothermal, ocean, biomass, and waste). The
explanatory variables include a vector of policy variables (POLICYi,t), specific R&D expenditures
(R&Di,t), electricity consumption (CONSi,t), electricity price (PRICEi,t) and total EPO filings (EPOi,t).
Fixed effects (  i ) are introduced to capture unobservable country-specific heterogeneity. All the
residual variation is captured by the error term (  i ,t ).
A negative binomial model is used to estimate the equation in (1). Count data models, such as
the Poisson and negative binomial, have been suggested for estimating the number of occurrences of
an event, or event counts (Maddala 1983: 51; Cameron and Trivedi 1998). In this paper, an event
count is the number of patent applications deposited at the EPO. Formally, an event count is defined
as a realization of a nonnegative integer-valued random variable. We suppose that the number of

12

patents ( PATENTSi ,t ) follows a negative binomial distribution, i.e. the patent count is modeled as a
Poisson process with an unobserved error parameter ( u ) introducing heterogeneity in the variance,
and an intensity parameter (  ) explained (in log) by a vector of explanatory variables ( X ):

Therefore, E PATENTSi ,t   and V  PATENTS    1   2  . It follows that as  2  0 the
model converges to the Poisson distribution with intensity

 . Maximum likelihood method is used to

estimate the parameters.4
Using data on patent counts the determinants of patenting activity for renewable energy are
assessed. In total, a panel of 25 countries and 26 years (1978-2003) is available, but the presence of
missing observations and all-zero outcomes of patent count for some countries and some technologies
reduce the size of the samples to between 400 and 500 in most models estimated.5

B. Empirical results
Several alternative specifications of the model were estimated. Table 5 presents the estimation results
when all policy dummies are included in the regressions, except the dummy for R&D programs (due
to correlation with the intercept).6 The coefficient of electricity price has a positive sign in every

and Griliches (1984).

The variation in the number of observations used in the regression models is due (a) to a small

number of missing values in the specific R&D variable, but (b) is mostly caused by all-zero outcomes
of patent counts leading to data for individual countries being dropped from the regression.

Most countries introduced R&D support programs as early as the 1970s. Since our data begin in

equation. It is statistically significant at the 1% and 5% levels in the solar and biomass equations,
respectively. This suggests that higher electricity prices provide an incentive for increased patenting
activity in the solar and biomass technologies. The results also suggest that renewable-specific R&D
spending is a significant determinant of patenting in renewable energy overall, and especially in wind
and ocean technologies.7 The estimated coefficient of electricity consumption is negative in every
equation and statistically significant only in the waste-to-energy equation. One possible explanation of
the negative sign could be related to the fact that policies aimed at renewables are often concurrent
with policies aimed at encouraging energy efficiency. The estimated coefficient of the total number of
EPO filings is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level in every technological area,
suggesting that a part of the variation in patenting activity in renewable energies is due to changes in
the general propensity to patent.8
The results on the policy dummies suggest that public policy plays a significant role in
inducing innovations in renewable energies. However, the efficacy of alternative policy instruments in
inducing innovations varies by renewable energy source. For wind technology and for renewable
energies overall, tax measures, obligations, and tradable certificates are statistically significant (at the
5% level and higher) policy instruments. Given that wind power is currently the most cost-effective of
these technologies, the finding that policies mandating additional renewable sources encourage
innovation for wind, but not other renewables, is consistent with the notion that firms focus
innovation on ways to comply with command and control regulations as cheaply as possible (Popp
2003). The variable reflecting the provision of investment incentives is statistically significant for

7

The negative and significant coefficient in the biomass equation is counter-intuitive. It is possible

that public R&D is „crowding out‟ private R&D. However, why this should be the case specifically
for biomass energy is not clear. Unfortunately, there is no data on private spending on R&D by
renewable source, and as such this remains a conjecture. Note also that the coefficient is not
statistically significant in any of the alternative models.

The coefficient is insignificant in the ocean equation. This is most likely due to the low variation in

ocean patent counts.

innovations in solar power. This is consistent with the hypothesis that more direct incentives are
needed for riskier investments. Investment incentives, as well as voluntary programs, are statistically
significant policy instruments for waste-to-energy incineration. Finally, putting in place preferential
tariff structures, and to a lesser extent tax measures, are statistically significant for patent activity with
respect to biomass energy.
There are two concerns related to including all policy dummies in the regression. First,
correlation among the dummies may cause multicollinearity problems. In particular, dummies
representing investment incentives, tax measures, and tariffs are correlated (correlation coefficient
0.53 and 0.57).9 Similarly, obligations and tradable permits are correlated (0.48).10 Second, it is
possible that there are interaction effects among alternative policy instruments (e.g., investment
incentives for capital goods may be accompanied by preferential tax rates for final goods). In an
alternative specification, the individual policy dummies were included one-by-one in the regressions.
The results (not reported) suggest that the key qualitative findings remain unaffected. Policies which
are found to be statistically significant when all dummies are included in the regression remain
statistically significant, and with the same signs, when they are included separately.
Including all policy dummies may cause multicollinearity. However, including policy
dummies one-by-one may lead to incorrect conclusions due to omitted variables and possible
interaction effects among the different policies. Two approaches are adopted in order to address these
issues: (a) clusters of policy variables are developed by clustering similar policies in groups (to
address possible multicollinearity and classification error); and (b) a composite policy variable is
constructed using principal component analysis. This latter variable also allows assessing dynamic
impacts in a more satisfactory manner.
9

The negative and statistically significant coefficient of tariffs in the wind energy equation could be

considered a consequence of multicollinearity. However, it remains robust even if the tax dummy is
dropped.
10

In spite of this, we get a positive and significant coefficient even for tradable certificates. This

suggests that allowing obligations to be traded provides a strong incentive for innovation.

15

Hierarchical cluster analysis is a method that can be applied in order to reduce a set of
correlated variables into a smaller number of cluster components, with little loss of information. This
allows for the identification of 'clusters' of policy instruments which are then used as explanatory
variables. The variables are clustered in such a manner that variables within one group are correlated,
but uncorrelated with variables in the other groups (see, for example, Hair et al. 1998).
The choice of the number of clusters to retain must be made ad hoc. We chose to use the
clustering of policy variables which yields three conceptually distinct groups of policies: (1) pricebased policy instruments (including investment incentives, tax measures, and tariffs), (2) voluntary
programs; and (3) quantity-based policy instruments (obligations and tradable certificates). We note
that the dummy variable for voluntary programs is approximately equally correlated with the
remaining two clusters. The estimated scoring coefficients were used to compute the component
scores for each cluster.
Table 6 shows the regression estimates when policy variables are divided into three clusters.
The estimated coefficients on the key regressors remain close to those obtained with individual policy
variables. The results suggest that innovation effects of alternative policy instruments differ by the
type of renewable energy technology. The evidence of differential policy effectiveness is particularly
straightforward for wind, solar, biomass and waste-to-energy technologies. For wind power, the
coefficient of quantity-based policy instruments (cluster 3) is positive and statistically significant at
the 1% level, again supporting the notion that command and control first promotes innovation on the
cheapest alternative. For solar, biomass and waste energy, the coefficients of price-based policy
instruments (cluster 1) are positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. In addition, the
coefficient of voluntary programs (cluster 2) in the waste equation is positive and statistically
significant at the 5% level or higher. For ocean energy, none of the policy cluster variables are
significant. Overall, for all renewables, the innovation effects of both price- and quantity-based
instruments are highly statistically significant. Voluntary approaches seem to play a minor role.
As an alternative to cluster analysis, principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce
the dimensionality of the set of individual policy variables. PCA transforms a number of correlated

16

variables into a (smaller) number of uncorrelated variables (principal components). The first principal
component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and in descending order
each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible (see, for
example, Hair et al. 1998).
In this study, we chose to keep only the first principal component for two reasons: (a) it
explains a good share of the variance (the inertia criterion), and (b) it is a true composite variable
since all variables have a positive sign, while the second principal component opposes two clusters. In
the first principal component, the estimated coefficients of all the policies are positive which means
that the variable captures national tendencies to develop environmental policies to support renewable
energy, but does not significantly disentangle policy types from each other. As a result, this variable
does not help to draw conclusions on the efficacy of the different kinds of policies, but is a good
indicator of the intensity of environmental regulation. The advantage of this approach is that the
composite variable addresses the problem of multicollinearity, as well as potential interaction effects
among policy instruments. Moreover, it can be lagged to analyze dynamic issues.
Table 7 presents the estimation results using the composite policy variable. The coefficients
remain close to those obtained previously. The estimated coefficient of the composite policy variable
is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level in every equation. This suggests that public
policy is a significant driver of innovative activity in renewable energy overall, as well as for specific
renewable energy sources. However, unlike before, we are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of
various policy types using the composite variable.
Using the same model, the dynamic aspects of innovative activity were analyzed using 1- to
4-year lags. In addition, for the composite policy variable a 1-year leap was tested since inventors
may anticipate the introduction of policies in support of the use of renewable energy sources. The
coefficients remain robust to such changes. The coefficient of the composite policy variable is most
significant with lags between 0 and 2 years, suggesting that the impact of public policy on patenting is
rather fast. This is consistent with the findings in Popp (2002) who found that energy patents followed
energy price changes with little lag.

17

Finally, there is a concern that variables such as electricity consumption, EPO patent filings,
and fixed effects may all, to a certain extent, reflect the same national tendencies. Including all of
these variables in a regression may cause „over-fitting‟ of the model. However, when country-specific
fixed effects are dropped from the regression the key qualitative findings remain robust.
In sum, the variable (EPO filings) reflecting scientific capacity and general propensity to
patent is consistently positive and significant. However, electricity price is only significant and
positive for solar power and electricity consumption is generally insignificant. Overall, public policy
plays an important role. Public expenditures on renewable-specific R&D consistently have a positive
and significant effect on patent activity, particularly for wind and ocean energy.
The other major policy-related finding of this paper is that different policies have a greater
effect on patent activity for some renewable energy sources than for others. In particular, quantitybased policy instruments such as obligations and tradable certificates are most effective in inducing
innovations in wind power technology. Price-based instruments such as investment incentives, tax
measures and tariffs are most effective in encouraging innovation in solar, biomass, and waste-toenergy technologies. Voluntary programs are not significant, except perhaps in the case of waste.
These findings are robust to alternative policy measures and model specifications.11
While our policy choice hypotheses are not fully supported, there are good economic reasons
to explain some of the findings. For instance, the significance of investment incentives for solar
energy is likely due to the fact that many solar installations are the most capital intensive (in terms of
investment costs required per kW) among the studied renewable energy technologies (see, for
example, Dickson and Fanelli 2004). Waste-to-energy investments can also involve significant upfront fixed costs, and the coefficient is significant and positive in this case as well. In addition, the
relative importance of voluntary programs for waste may be explained by the importance of the public
sector in waste management, perhaps obviating the need for mandatory regulations. The hypothesis

11

In addition to the models described above, random effects negative binomial models were estimated

and the results confirm robustness of the major findings.

18

that quantity-based measures are likely to be more important for less mature technologies (that is, that
such policies can be “technology forcing”) is not supported. Indeed, it is only in the case of wind
power that obligations are significant. However, the significant and positive coefficient on price-based
measures (feed-in tariffs) for biomass is consistent with our hypothesis since this source is relatively
mature and competitive.

V. Conclusions
This paper examines the effects of public policies on innovation in the area of renewable energies in a
cross-section of OECD countries over the period 1978-2003. Patent counts are used as the most
suitable proxy for innovation and the effects of a wide variety of different policy types are assessed.
The descriptive data indicates rapid growth in wind and waste-to-energy patent activity,
particularly since the mid-1990s. There continues to be innovation with respect to solar energy,
perhaps reflecting the opportunities presented by developments in concentrating solar power.
Innovation with respect to biomass and ocean energy are also growing, but from a very low base. And
finally, there appears to have been little innovation in the area of geothermal energy since the 1970s.
At the same time, significant changes have occurred in the public policy framework put in
place to support renewable energy. Initially R&D programs were introduced in a number of countries.
This was followed by investment incentives, and later, tax incentives and preferential tariffs. Next,
voluntary programs were developed. More recently, quantitative obligations, and finally tradable
certificates, have been applied.
Our empirical results indicate that public policy has had a very significant influence on the
development of new technologies in the area of renewable energy. Using the composite policy
variable, statistical significance at the 1% level is found for all renewable energy sources, except
biomass (where it is significant at the 5% level). However, the results suggest that instrument choice
also matters. With respect to patent activity in renewable energy overall, taxes, obligations and
tradable certificates are the only statistically significant policy instruments.

19

Interestingly however, source-specific models indicate that there is variation in the effects of
instrument type on different renewables. As governments place increasing emphasis on developing a
portfolio of energy alternatives, understanding these differences is important for policy. Broadly,
investment incentives are effective in supporting innovation in solar and waste-to-energy
technologies, tariff structures are important for biomass, obligations and tradable certificates (which
are closely related) support wind technology, and voluntary programs are helpful in inducing wasteto-energy innovations. Overall, only tax incentives have wide influence on innovation for a number of
renewable energy sources.
While the results are interesting and robust, further work in the area could be undertaken. This
includes accounting for variation in natural conditions as determinants of patenting in renewable
energy technologies, and better examination of dynamic issues, with a particular focus on addressing
the possible simultaneity of R&D expenditures and patenting activity.
