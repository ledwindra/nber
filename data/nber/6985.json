Exchange rates have statistically significant wage and employment implications in these local labor markets.  The importance and size of these dollar-induced effects vary considerably across industries and are more pronounced in some U.S. regions.  In addition to the importance of exchange rate shocks, we confirm prior research results showing that relatively strong local conditions drive up wage in local industries, while anticipated future (positive) local shocks reduce current wages.\n\n",
