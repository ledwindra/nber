THE JAPANESE TAX REFORM AND THE EFFECTIVE
RATE OF TAX ON JAPANESE CORPORATE INVESTNENTS
ABSTRACT

Japan is in the midst of reforming ita national level individual and
corporation income

tax systems.

Last year it abandoned its large system of

tax free savings accounts and lowered individual marginal tax rates.

A

much more radical proposal is currently heing advocated by the government
and is well along the way towards passage in the Diet.

The new proposal

would significantly lower the statutory rate for the corporation income
tax, lower individual rates further and increase the tax thresholds, tax

and introduce a type of
capital gains on securities for the first time,
value added tax.

As a package, this would be the most important change in

the Japanese tax system since 1950.

This paper presents a brief summary of the Japanese income tax system
and the changes in it that have been enacted or proposed.

It also

discusses and evaluates the pressures for reform, both domestic and
international.

Finally, the paper looks at how the taxation of capital

income in Japan has changed since 1980 and how it compares to the U.S.

taxation of capital income after our 1986 tax reform.

One major finding of

the paper is that the effective marginal tax rate on corporate capital

income in Japan has increased sharply since 1980 from roughly five percent
to about 32 percent.

This change, which still leaves the marginal taxation

on corporate investments somewhat lower in Japan than in the U.S., is due
to both changes in the Japanese tax code and the virtual elimination of
inflation in Japan.

Introduction

Japan is in the midst of reforming its national level individual and
corporation income tax systems.

Last year it abandoned its large system of

tax free savings accounts and lowered individual marginal cax rates.

A

much more radical proposal is currently being advocated by the government
and is well along the way towards passage in the Diet.

The new proposal

would significantly lower the statutory rate for the corporation income
tax, lower individual rates further and increase the tax thresholds, tax

a type of
capital gains on securities for the first time, and introduce
value added tax.

As a package, this would be the most important change in

the Japanese tax system since 1950.

It also

and evaluates the pressures for reform, both domestic and

international.

The U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986, with its low marginal tax

rates, is among the forces for change in Japan.

Finally, the paper looks

at how the taxation of capital income in Japan has changed since 1980 and
how it compares to the U.S. taxation of capital income after our 1986 tax
reform.

if only
Developments in the Japanese economy are worth monitoring
because it is the second largest economy in the world and its economic
performance

is widely admired.

It has achieved high economic growth rates,

a recently stable price level, a trade surplus, and a high level of

national saving and investment.

In previous work (Shoven and Tmchibanaki,

the
1988) I found that in 1980 Japan had a much lower tax wedge between
1

return on investments and the return enjoyed by investors than in the U.S..
That is, in Japan the government took a smaller fraction and the investor a
larger fraction of the return on a new marginal investment.

One question

that this paper addresses is whether that lower level of effective taxation
on incremental capital income still persists in Japan in 1988 and will
continua to do so if the proposed tax reforms are enacted.

The Japanese Tax System

Japan and the U.S. have the lowest overall tax burden as a percent of
GDP of the major OECD countries listed in Table 1.
percent)

is slightly lower than that for the U.S.

Japan's figure (28.0

Japan also generates

far lass revenue as a fraction of GDP from the household level income tax

than does the U.S.

In fact, Japan's revenue from the individual income tax

is less than any of the countries except France.

Its reliance on sales and

consumption taxes is the lowest among the eleven countries.

In contrast,

its corporation income tax raises the highest fraction of CD? (well over
twice the comparable U.S. figure).

It is this heavy use of the corporation

tax which made my previous result of light taxation of income from new

Japanese capital investments surprising.
As in the U.S., there are three levels of taxation in Japan: the
national level, the prefecture (state) level, and the municipal level.

we exclude the social security payroll contributions, the individual income

In fact, the tax of most wage earners is automatically

calculated through a sophisticated withholding mechanism.

Most individuals

whose income is predominately wages do not even have to fill out a tax
return.

However, the individual basis of taxation

does open up the

possibility of income splitting for the self employed small businessman and
those with significant sources of capital income.
The marginal tax rate structures for the national level individual
income tax are shown in Table 2 for 1986, for 1987 (after the September
1987 tax revisions), and for the 1988 proposal of the Ministry of Finance.

In 1986 there were 15 rate brackets with marginal rates ranging from 10.5
to 70 percent; in 1987 these were replaced with 12 brackets ranging from
10.5 percent to 60 percent; the proposal now under consideration would
replace these with five brackets with marginal tax rates from 10.0 to 50

The number of rate hrackets for the inhabitants tax (local income

tax) is proposed to be reduced from fourteen (with rates ranging from 4.5
percent to 18 percent) to four (with rates ranging from S to 15 percent).
The top combined rate was 88 percent in 1986 and would be 65 percent under
the current proposal.

The puzzle of why the marginal rates for the individual income tax are
relativelyhigh and revenues relatively low is partially answered by the
generous levels of the tax thresholds (the level of income below which no

tax is paid).

Table 3 shows that the threshold level of wage and salary

income for a one earner family of four will have increased by almost 36
percent in two years if the latest proposals

are adopted.

The proposed tax

threshold for a family of four is 3,198,000 yen or $26,000 at the current

exchange rate (123 yen/dollar), more than twice the tax threshold in the
U.S. for a family of the same composition (the sun of the U.S. system's

standard deduction and personal exemptions for a family of four was $8,300
in 1986 and $12,800 in 1988).
Japan is roughly 4 million yen.

Note that the average annual wage income in

of their tax system rather than to enjoy the efficiency

that could have come from lower marginal rates.

This feature of relatively

high income thresholds is long standing and was one of the primary reasons
why Pechman and Kaizuken (1976) found that only 33 percent of Japanese
national income was reported as taxable income in 1970, compared with 59
percent for the U.S. at that time.

Despite the high top rates, note that

This last feature

effectivelyeliminates the problem of timing income so as to minimize
taxes.

In principle, the Japanese individual income tax system applies to
aggregate income (such as interest income, dividend income, rents, business
income, wages, retirement income, timber income, capital gains, etc.).

In

practice, many of these income sources are eligible for special treatment.

Retirement income and timber income are always taxed separately, and
interest, dividends, and capital gains are often taxed separately

option.

The treatment of interest income has been amongst the most generous of
these special treatments.

Until the September 1987 tax reforms, there were

two special features of the law favoring interest income.

First, Japanese

taxpayers wera allowed to have four types of tax free savings plans

offering tax free interest.

The types of tsx free interest were

i. Interest accruing from postal savings when the principal does not

exceed 3 million yen.

8

ii.

Interest income or distribution of profits from deposits, bonds,

and debentures, open-end bond investment trusts, or specific stock
investment trusts if the amount of principal in total does not
exceed 3 million yen.

This provision

is called the "Small Saving

Tax Exemption" ("Maruyu" in common Japanese).

iii. Interest on central-government

and local-government bonds, not

exceeding 3 million yen in total face value.

iv. Interest income or distribution of profits received in accounts

set up for the formation of employees' assets, particularly for
housing and pensions.

Various forms of monetary assets are

eligible for this exemption.

It requires, however, that the

employees commit to savings contracts that are withheld from
their wages and that the total amount of principal does not
exceed 5 million yen.

Summing up these four items, an individual could have had up to 14

million yen ($113,821) in nontaxable forms.
members,

If the household had several

the amount of nontsxsble savings could be increased accordingly.

A family of four could have legally held over $455,000 in tax free saving
vehicles.

Further, there was widespread evidence of abuse of this system,

with accounts being held in fictitious names.

Nsgono (1988) estimates that

over 70 percent of all personal saving took advsntsge of these tax exempt

vehicles with 13.5 trillion yen ($110 billion) escaping the tax base.

tax on all interest income (withheld at source) of 20 percent, with 15

percent collected for the national government and 5 percent for local
taxes.

The second tax advantage offered on interest income is separate
taxation.

Even before 1987, interest received on savings deposits and

similar accounts (other than tax exempt ones) waa subject to a separate 20

percent withholding tax at source and then could be excluded from taxable
income in filing a return.

For other forms of interest income (bond

interest, etc.) the taxpayer could aggregate it with taxable income or pay

a separate tax of 35 percent.

None of interest income was subject to the

marginal rates ranging up to 70 percent shown in the rate schedule.

This

separate taxation option will remain available if the present reform
package is adopted.

The taxpayer also has the option of sepsrste taxation of dividend
income.

In addition to the advantages of separate taxation, dividends are
level due to another feature of the
lightly taxed at the individual
individual tax law.

For taxpayers with ordinary taxable income of less

than 10 million yen ($81,300), a tax credit amounting to ten percent of
dividends received is allowed.

For those with higher taxable incomes, the

credit is reduced, although it always exceeds five percent.

The basic ten

percent credit means that the maximum marginal rate of national level
taxation of dividends (which occurs under separate taxation) is effectively
25 percent (10 percent for small dividends).

Capital gains on securities are not taxed in Japan, although
current proposal would change this.

It would give taxpayers the option of

paying a tax equal to one percent of the value of the stock transaction or
to pay a separate tax on the actual gain at the rate of twenty percent.
The one percent of sales value option implies that capital gains on
securities will still be very lightly taxed in Japan relative to their

current treatment in the U.S. (fully taxable at ordinary rates upon
realization).

If the Ministry of

Almost

all interest income will be separately taxed at a 20 percent rate.
However, capital gains will still be lightly taxed and dividenda will still
be eligible for a tax credit and optional separate taxation with a 35

percent rate.
The general outline of the corporate income tax in

In other words, interest expenses are deductible as in

approximately a flat rate system

(also as in the United States) with slightly lower rates applying to
only

very small corporations.
The Japanese corporation income tax differs from the kserican one in
its treatment of dividends paid and inter-corporate

dividends.

The current

Japanese tax system attempts to partially offset the double taxation of
corporate equity income by taxing dividends paid at a lower rate than

retained earnings.

The current national rates are 42 percent for retained

earnings and 32 percent for dividends paid (reduced in 1987 from 43.3 and
33.3 percent, respectively).

The effective rates including local taxes are

approximately 55 and 45 percent respectively.

The Ministry of Finance

estimates the overall marginal corporate tax rate on
equity income as 51.55

percent in 1988 (down from 52.92 percent in 1986).

This compares to their

estimate of the U.S. rate (including state corporation income
taxes) of

40.34 percent.
The current reform proposal would phase out this
separate treatment of
dividends and returned earnings.

It proposes that the national corporation
12

income tax rate be set at 37.5 percent for 1990 and beyond.

While this is

the
only slightly higher than the U.S. corporate rate of 34 percent,
difference widens when you take state and local level taxation into
account.

The Ministry of Finance estimates that the total Japanese

corporate rate would be 49.99 percent under their proposals compared to the
U.S. figure of 40.34 percent.

Unlike the U.S. tax system, the Japanese corporation income tax has
always exempted intercorporate dividend income from the tax base, thus

avoiding double taxation.

However, the new proposal adopts the U.S.

practice of partial taxation of dividends received by a corporation.

It

proposes including 10 percent of corporate dividends received in the
corporate tax hase in 1989, with 20 percent (the U.S. figure) inclusion in
1990 and thereafter.
The Japanese tax system permits several types of tax-free reserves

which serve to reduce reported corporate earnings and therefore taxes.
These reserves include the

(1) reserve for

bad debts,

(2) reserve

returned goods, (3) reserve for employee bonus payments,
retirement allowances,

for

(4) reserve for

(5) reserve for repairs and product guarantees,

corporations, etc.

It is the interaction of the Japanese corporation and individual income
tax which can create very low effective taxation of corporate capital
income.

Given that the corporate statutory rate is relatively high and

the individual rates on interest relatively low, interest payments are in

effect subsidized.

The cost to a corporation of making a 10 percent

interest payment will be roughly 5 percent even if the new proposed rate
structure is adopted.

On the other hand, the investor will receive 8

percent (after the 20 percent tax).

This net subsidy clearly reduces the

cost of capital. It also is less effective at lower nominal interest rates.

3.

The Pressures for Reform

The previous section described most of the elements of the enacted and
proposed tax reform.

Those include virtual elimination of the tax free

savings account system except for people in special circumstances,

reducing

the number of brackets and the highest rates for the individual income tax,
raising the individual

income tax's threshold income levels, lowering the

basic rate of the corporation income tax and eliminating the different
treatment of dividends paid and retained earnings, curtailing the use of
corporation reserve accounts, and introducing a tax on intercorporate
dividends.
There is one additional major component of the proposed tax reform.

That is the introduction of a new consumption-type value added tax.

The

current proposal is for a broad based 3 percent tax with very limited
exemptions.

There would be an exemption for very small enterprises (sales

less than $240,000) and a simplified procedure available to small and

medium-sized firms (sales under $4 million).

The commodity tax currently applies to a number of

However, in an economy as dynamic as Japan's, many of the

taxed items (e.g. air-conditioners, television sets, refrigerators, etc.)
are no longer appropriately considered luxuries.
There are a number of separate pressures for Japanese tax reform that

can be identified.

These include compliance problems with the existing tax

system and a widespread feeling that it

encouraging the Japanese to adopt a more pro-

consumption tax system, concern about the international mobility of
factors, particularly capital and entrepreneurs, in the face of a Jmpanese

system with comparatively high marginal tax rates, projections that
government revenues will need to expand significantly to deal with the
rapid growth of the retired population, and concern that corporate tax
revenues would be jeopardized (through transfer pricing and financial
arbitrage) unless the Japanese corporation income tax were roughly

harmonized with the recently changed U.S. tax system.

a.

Compliance Problems and Fairness Considerations

Fairness issues are probably the biggest motivator of the Japanese

reform movement.

The same may well have been true in the U.S.

One

very important aspect of the Japanese compliance and fairness problem
is referred to as "10-5-3" or sometimes "9-6-4".

These numbers refer

to the fact that it is commonly believed that 90-100 percent of the
income of workers is subject to tax, whereas only 50-60 percent of
business income (particularly the income of small businesses) is

15

reported, and only 30 to 40 percent of farm income is subject to tax.

in the research of

The problem is thought to have gotten

worse in the past twenty years (Noguchi, 1988).

The introduction of a

VAT is thought to help this 10-5-3 problem in two ways.

First, the

required record keeping and invoice reporting will improve income
reporting on the income tax.

And, second, the VAT itself will be borne

by all consumers relatively evenly.
A second aspect of the compliance problem is that there is no
taxpayer identification

scheme (similar to the 13.5. social security

number or taxpayer ID number) in Japan.

This facilitated the abuse of

the Maruyu saving system and adds to the general impression that the
wealthy could conceal income from taxation.

There has been tremendous

political opposition to the introduction of an ID system.

The result

has been increasing use of a withholding at source system (now for
interest income as well as wages and proposed for capital gains).

It

is hoped that the combination of withholding taxes and a VAT will
considerably improve the fairness of the Japanese tax system.

b. The Agins Society

The Japanese position in Table 1 as the least taxed major OECD
country is largely due to its relatively light social security burden.

Japan has one of the lowest fractions of the populations which is

2.3 in 2020.

This ratio is, of course, of utmost importance for pay-

as-you-go national retirement schemes such as those in Japan and the
U.S.

Some of the expenses of Japanese social security coverage are

paid for out of general revenues and the expectation is that the
reliance on general revenues will have to he increased.

The lower

panel of Table 4 shows that while Japan has had the lowest fraction of
elderly in their populationbetween 1950 and 1985, by 2000 their
elderly fraction will be more than 30 percent greater than in the U.S.

and by 2020, they will have the highest fraction of elderly of the five
countries shown.

It is projected that the fraction of the Japanese

population which will be over 65 will be more than twice the fraction

that are currently elderly in either the U.S. or Japan.

Labor Supply and the Brain Drain Fear

Reducing the progreasivity of the individual income tax is an
important and intentional element of the Japanese tax reform.

Financial Arbitrage and Transfer Pricing

Further,

the use of internal transfer pricing can shift reported profits from

higher rate countries than those with lower rates.

It is possible that

high corporate rates thus become counter-productive in terms of
generating revenue.

This type of argument, and the concerns of

transfer pricing and international borrowing, have been major
pressures for lowering corporate rates in Canada as well as in Japan.

If the current reform is adopted, Japan, the U.S., and the U.K.
will have very similar rates of corporate taxation at the national
level.

The rates will range froa 34 to 37.5 percent.

Such a narrow

range probably stops most accounting practices designed solely for
relocating profits.

The Effective Rate of Tsxation on Corporate Capital Income

My earlier work with Tachibanaki (Shoven and Tachibanaki, 1988) found
that the Japanese government got a very small percentage

(4.4%) of the

return on domestically financed incremental investments in 1980, while the
investor (on average) got 95.6 percent of the return.

In this section,

the methodology that gave us that finding is summarized and the results are

results differ dramatically from the earlier study.

The Shoven and Tachibanaki study used the same methodology as King and
Fullerton

(1984).

What is examined

is the total tax wedge

return of an incremental investment and the return realized by the investor
or financier.

and personal level taxation.

Despite the fact that the pattern of the numbers in Table 5 is similar
to those for 1980, the "beat guess" -effective marginal rate of taxation on
corporate

investments in Japan changed considerably between 1980 and 1985.

Shoven and Tachibanaki (1988) estimated the overall figure to be 4.4

percent in 1980.

However, that result depended on a specification

of the

expected rate of inflation which was taken as the average of the inflation
rates experienced in the 1970a (9 percent).
several years of 2 percent inflation.

By 1985, Japan had experienced

If that is taken as the expected

rate of inflation, the overall tax rate for 1985 is about 26 percent.
The effective tax rate calculations for the current proposal are shown
in Table 6.

The increased tax on interest income, the reduced corporate

tax rate, the elimination of the differential between retained earnings and
dividends, and the new capital gains tax on profits on securities are all
captured in the model.

The tax reform would slightly increase the

effective corporate tax rate at zero inflation and would make the tax rate

much leas sensitive to inflation.

The large potential subsidy to debt

financed investments is largely eliminated by the reduction

in the

statutory corporate tax rates and by the increase in the taxation of
interest income at the individual level.

The "best guess" overall effective tax rate for new corporate
investments in Japan after the implementation of the 1988 tax reform
proposals is 31.8 percent.

The reason that this number is chosen from the

bottom row of Table 6 is that there is now a remarkable degree of price
level stability in Japan.

Consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in 1986, 0.1

percent in 1987, and are expected to increase about 0.4 percent in 1988.

The overall conclusion that I draw from Table S and 6 is that the
effective rate of taxation of new investment in Japan has risen
substantially since 1980.

Most of that increase hss taken place because of

the elimination of inflation.

The tax reform itself would increase the

effective tax rate slightly (at zero percent inflation) and take a major
stride in making the system less sensitive to inflation, should it return.
The tax incentives for debt, while still considerable, would be
substantially

reduced.

The effective tax rate faced by Japanese investors on domestic
corporate investments remains lower than the effective tax rate faced by

American inveators on U.S. corporate investments.

The difference has

corporate investment from 29.4 percent to 41.1 percent.
reform's main accomplishment

The U.S. tax

in this area was evening the treatment of

different corporate assets (e.g. plant vs. equipment) by eliminating the
investment tax credit on equipment and by adjusting depreciation lifetimes.

Tables 5 and 6 indicate that the differences across asset type were not
great in Japan even before their reform.

What neither country has

addressed is the substantial difference between the treatnent of owner
occupied housing and corporate capital investments.

The Japanese tax reform proposals are extremely significant.

The VAT is likely to he the tax vehicle that will

permit Japan to finance its rapidly growing dependent elderly population.
And, a combination of several elements in the reform and the almost
complete absence of inflation have caused the effective tax rate on
corporate capital income to increase to a point where it is comparable,

although still lower, than the corresponding U.S. figures.

The reforms of

1987 have already reduced the tax system's bias towards debt and made its
effects on investment incentives less dependent on the rate of inflation.
