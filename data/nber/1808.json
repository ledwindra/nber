Examining the strike activity and unionization rates of some 600 nonunion municipal police departments from 1972 to 1978, this study finds that recognition strikes are concentrated where bargaining laws provide little or no protection of bargaining rights for municipal police. However, these strikes do not increase the unionization propensities of these police departments.\n\n",
