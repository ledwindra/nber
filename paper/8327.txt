Introduction

Closures of manufacturing plants are big news. Local communities and plant workers mobilize to protest the closures, while local
politicians often oﬀer financial carrots and sticks to keep the plants
open.1 Increasingly in recent years, headlines accompanying plant closure notices have cited international forces as the reasons behind the
shutdowns. In this paper, we develop and test the predictions of an
endowment-based trade model for rates of plant entry and exit across
industries and regions. Of particular interest are the predictions of
the model for the interaction between changes in regional factors and
industrial restructuring.
This paper examines the shutdown of manufacturing plants across
industries and regions. We develop the implications of endowmentbased Heckscher-Ohlin trade models for plant entry and exit and augment them with insights from the market structure models of endogenous plant heterogeneity such as Hopenhayn (1992a). HeckscherOhlin models have predictions for net entry rates across industries
and regions. In contrast, the market structure models concentrate on
explaining the comovement of entry and exit rates across industries
and have no predictions for net entry or regional variation. We consider both variation across industries and variation across regions in

page headlines.

our empirical work.
Heckscher-Ohlin trade models provide predictions both for which
industries will grow (positive net entry rates) and for which regions will
see high turnover and net entry of plants.2 In a country augmenting
both its physical and human capital such as the US, the least capitalintensive, least skill-intensive industries are correctly predicted to have
the highest exit rates. In addition, we develop a new component
of the plant-level data and exploit the geographic detail available by
dividing the US into individual labor market regions.3 As predicted by
the Heckscher-Ohlin model, regions within the country that have the
biggest endowment changes are associated with higher exit rates and
higher entry rates. For regions accumulating capital, the endowmentbased trade model correctly predicts that net entry rates are higher
for capital-intensive industries.
Because of their inherent focus on steady state equilibria, the market structure models cannot predict variation in net entry rates. Existing market structure models do, however, correctly predict that entry and exit rates will covary positively across industries. High entry
costs cause both low entry and low exit probabilities. The entry cost
proxies that correctly predict the comovement in industry entry and
exit rates explain none of the heterogeneity in net entry rates across
industries.
This work at the industry and regional levels confirms the importance of the market structure models in explaining industry level
comovements in plant entry and exit rates. More importantly, we
introduce endowment-based trade theory as an important additional
component of the ongoing evolution of the US manufacturing sector.
While the market structure models had little role for net entry, a simple H-O trade model does well in not only predicting which industries
2

Of course, the Heckscher-Ohlin model is silent on the sources of covariation in
entry and exit.

In this paper, we do not take a stand on whether plants in these regions face
the same factor prices. The regional predictions developed below hold if the US
regions are in either a single or multiple factor price equalization cones.

should see net entry but also where those capital-intensive industries
will locate.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 details the
predictions for industry and regional entry, exit and net entry from a
simple Heckscher-Ohlin trade model and the market structure models.
The description of the data, the basic empirical specification, and main
results follow in Section 3. Conclusions are presented in Section 4.

Predictions from the models

In this section we develop a set of testable hypotheses from a basic
Heckscher-Ohlin model of trade about entry and exit for both industries and regions. We also examine the empirical predictions of
existing industry models of plant exit and entry.
While the eﬀects of international trade on domestic economies are
the subject of heated debate, surprisingly little is known about the
actual mechanisms by which trade aﬀects the economy. Trade theory
oﬀers predictions about the evolution of industries and economies over
the long run, but is usually silent on the means by which the transformations occur. Heckscher-Ohlin trade models, for example, predict
changes in industry composition as a result of changing endowments
within a country. In a country such as the US which has been increasing both its physical and human capital intensity as shown in Figure
1, these models predict that the mix of industries will change towards
more capital intensive products.4 Hanson and Slaughter (1999) report such a shift of product mix in US states in response to increased
immigration during the 1980s.5 The models themselves usually do
not predict how these changes will show up in the economy. One

we were interested in the factor content of trade we would want to look at the US
endowment changes relative to the rest of the world.

possibility is for industries to adjust the mix of products entirely at
existing plants, changing the factor intensities and/or product mix at
those facilities. At the other extreme, the adjustment comes entirely
through exits and entrants as outdated plants are shuttered and new
facilities are opened.6
In this paper we focus on one possible adjustment margin, the
decision to shut down manufacturing facilities and by implication the
decision to open new plants. In any five year period, more than 35
percent of existing US manufacturing plants are closed.7 Typically,

smaller establishments are the most likely to exit, but closures are
relatively frequent events even for the large facilities that garner so
much news coverage. Of plants with more than 250 employees, over
16 percent will close in any five year interval accounting for 7.8 percent
of manufacturing employment.
Unlike previous work on plant shutdown and startup, our focus is
primarily on net entry of plants, or changes in industrial structure. Existing dynamic industry models are based primarily on the empirical
findings of Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1988, 1989) that plant entry and exit rates are correlated across industries. Figure 2 shows the
variation in entry and exit rates within and across two SIC (Standard
Industrial Classification) digit industries in the US manufacturing sector for 1987-1992.8 Entry and exit rates do indeed appear to have a
Samuelson (1988) for evidence on entry and exit from 1963-1987.

Entry and exit rates are calculated separately for each 4-digit industry. Each

strong industry-specific component. Apparel (SIC 23), lumber (24),
furniture (25), printing and publishing (27), and misc manufacturing
(39) have above average entry and exit rates in most of their 4-digit
subsectors. In contrast, paper (26), chemicals (28), petroleum and
coal (29), primary metals (33), and fabricated metals (34) show below average entry and exit rates. Hopenhayn (1992a) constructs a
dynamic model of industry evolution that attempts to match these
facts. In his model, industry-specific entry costs provide for positive
covariation in entry and exit rates. One striking attribute of this class
of models is that entry and exit exactly oﬀset one another allowing for
no net entry diﬀerences across industries.
Also reported, but usually overlooked, in Dunne, Roberts and
Samuelson (1988), is the fact that the comovement of entry and exit
rates across industries is largely due to persistent industry eﬀects.
Controlling for time-invariant industry eﬀects, entry and exit rates
move in opposite directions. The variation in net entry rates across
four-digit industries is substantial. Figure 3 reports the variation in
net entry rates within and across two-digit industries. Again there
appear strong industry components as apparel (23), petroleum (29)
and leather (31) have negative net entry for almost all 4-digit industries while subsectors in plastics (30) and instruments (38) almost all
have positive net entry. Existing models of market structure cannot
explain such variation. We employ a simple Heckscher-Ohlin model
of endowment-based international trade to understand what is driving
the substantial heterogeneity in net entry rates across industries.

trade model on plant entry and exit. For ease of exposition, we will

the box is the rate for the median 4-digit sector within the two digit industry.
The whiskers extend to ±1.5* the interquartile range.

Figure 3: Net Plant Creation Rates, 4-Digit (SIC) Industries, 19871992
start with the simplest version of the H-O model with two factors and
two goods. Figure 4 shows the factor accumulation path for a country
over time. As the country moves from point 0 to point 1 accumulating
skill, the labor intensive industry decreases in size until it finally shuts
down.
Even this basic model gives some natural predictions about where
we should expect to see plant shutdowns. If the US occupies a single
cone and is accumulating skill, then we would expect to see higher
exit rates in labor-intensive industries and higher entry rates in skillintensive industries.9
9

One problem with the basic H-O trade model is that it has no predictions on
intra-industry structure. The reduction in output in the labor-intensive industry could come through plant shutdowns or reductions in plant size. Even the
complete disappearance of the industry could occur with existing plants chang-

In addition to accumulating skill, the US has been increasing its
capital-intensity substantially during the 1970s and 1980s. The simple H-O model predicts that, conditional on skill-intensity, shutdowns
would be highest in the least capital-intensive sectors. One problem with looking at industry capital intensity is that it may also
be correlated with industry entry costs, i.e. semiconductors versus
shoes. As we will discuss below, market structure models, i.e. Hopenhayn (1992a), predict that both entry and exit rates would be lower
in capital-intensive industries (semiconductors) and higher in laborintensive industries (shoes). However, while entry and exit rates
might both be lower, the H-O model predicts that the net entry rate
across industries would be positively related to capital intensity, i.e.
we would expect to see more net entry in the chip industry than in
the footwear business. The steady state market structure models have
no predictions about net entry rates as entry and exit are always balanced.
2.1.1.

Regions in the H-O model

One interesting attribute of the H-O model is that it yields predictions not only about heterogeneity in industry entry and exit but also
about which regions are most likely to experience substantial plant
turnover. If the regions of the US have diﬀerent factor endowments,
even if they occupy a single factor price equalization cone, then the
HO model contains additional predictions about the location and factor intensity of plant shutdowns. In Figure 5, region B is accumulating
skilled labor while endowments in region A are unchanged. As a result, both the exit rate and entry rates should be higher in region B
than in region A.10 The size of the change in the regional endowment
ing products. Throughout this paper we assume some of the output adjustment
margin will occur through net exit. In our empirical work this is a maintained
hypothesis.
10
While the H-O model does not comment on entry and exit in the absence
of endowment changes, we would expect both regions to experience positive exit
and entry rates even in the steady state for the reasons outlined in the market

Skill

matters for plant closure and birth. Regions with relatively small
changes in endowments would see fewer shutdowns and startups. In
addition, the exit rates should be higher in the labor intensive industries in region B than in the same industries in region A and the
entry rates should be higher in the skill intensive industries in region
B than those in region A. The H-O model with multiple regions thus
predicts that regional exit and entry rates should be correlated with
regional endowment changes. Perhaps more importantly, the interaction of increased regional skill (and capital) abundance with industry
skill (capital) intensity should be positively correlated with entry rates
and negatively correlated with exit rates.11 Moreover, both of these
eﬀects would remain even if the regions were in diﬀerent factor price
structure models below.
11
Note that with identical factor prices across the regions, there is no incentive for factors to migrate. Of course, we must take changes in regional factor
endowments as exogenous.

cones.
The H-O model yields predictions about entry, exit and net entry
across regions and industries. In a country that is accumulating capital and skills such as the US, plant closures will occur more frequently
in the least capital and skill-intensive industries and plant births will
occur more often in the most capital and skill intensive industries. In
addition, regions that are changing their endowments rapidly will be
more likely to experience plant turnover, both entry and exit. Within
regions, industries with factor intensities at odds with the new endowments will be more likely to have high exit rates while industries
with similar factor usage most similar to the new endowments will
experience higher entry rates.
2.2. Market Structure Models
There is a body of research on plant entry and exit stimulated
largely by the work of Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988, 1989),
(henceforth DRS). Looking across industries, DRS (1988) find that
plant entry and exit rates at the level of the four digit (SIC) industry
are strongly positively correlated, and that the correlation persists over
time. This can be seen in Figure 6 for the 1987-92 period. Entry
rates are plotted against exit rates for 4-digit manufacturing industries
and show a strong positive correlation.12 However, once they control
for persistent industry eﬀects, DRS find that entry and exit rates
are negatively correlated. They conclude that there are substantial
persistent structural factors that move entry and exit rates in the
same direction and industries are more consistently characterized by

turnover than net entry rates.
These findings and conclusions of DRS had a strong impact on the
subsequent theoretical literature generating a variety of market structure models. Hopenhayn (1992a,b) develops a general equilibrium
model of entry and exit to largely match the DRS facts. Hopenhayn’s model focuses on a steady state with balanced entry and exit.
Comparative static exercises reveal that increases in entry costs lower
both entry and exit rates causing them to move together.
Surprisingly, there has been little empirical work on the crossindustry determinants of entry and exit rates. Dunne and Roberts
(1991) find that industries with lower entry and exit rates are more
capital intensive, have higher average firm size, and higher price-cost
margins. In our subsequent empirical work, we use these variables and
other proxies for the entry costs envisioned by Hopenhayn (1992a) and
provide evidence on the source of the positive correlation between in-

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 14

dustry entry and exit rates. In addition, both the theoretical and
empirical literatures have ignored the fact that controlling for persistent industry eﬀects entry and exit rates are negatively correlated at
the industry level. We attempt to rectify this omission by considering the implications of models of international trade in determining
industry entry and exit rates as well as diﬀerences in net entry rates
across industries.
To develop a complete picture of the variation in entry and exit
across industries and regions, we need both variation in net entry and
industry comovements in entry and exit rates. By itself, neither the
endowment-based trade model nor the market structure model gives
a complete picture.
3.

Empirical results

The predictions from the market structure and trade models presented above are essentially medium to long-run in nature. To test
them, we use data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures (CM) conducted every fifth year from 1972 to 1992 and contained in the Longitudinal Research Database of the Bureau of the Census. This data
has been described in detail elsewhere and was the source employed
by DRS in their studies which covered the period 1963-1987.
Several attributes of the data are especially important for our
analysis. First, we characterize a plant exit or death as the case
when an establishment is in a Census in year t but not in year t+5. If
that plant were to reappear in a subsequent Census, either under the
same or diﬀerent management, we would register an entrant or birth.
The entry rate for industry i in year t is defined as13
ERit =
13

Birthst→t+5
0.5 (All P lantst + All P lantst+5 )

(1)

We use these definitions of entry, exit, and net entry rates in all the empirical
specifications. These definitions allow us to calculate measures even when no
plants are operating in the cell in one of the years.

and the exit rate as
XRit =

0.5 (All P lantst + All P lantst+5 )

(2)

and the net entry rate as
NRit =

Birthst→t+5 − Deathst→t+5
.
0.5 (All P lantst + All P lantst+5 )

(3)

For our industry and regional analysis, we employ a variety of
measures at the industry level.14 These are all calculated in year t
for the interval from t to t+5. For our measure of industry physical
capital intensity, we employ the level of log capital per worker for
the median plant in the industry. Similarly for skill intensity, we use
the level for the median plant in the industry of the share of nonproduction wages in total wages.15
One main problem in attempting to test the predictions of the market structure models is the lack of data on the sunk entry costs which
drive the comovements of industry exit and entry rates. Hopenhayn
(1992a) points out that changes in sunk entry costs have a potentially
ambiguous impact on firm size and that profits and market share will
be higher for large firms but not necessarily for small firms. We
employ measures of total employment, markups and concentration of
output at the industry level in an attempt to proxy for factors that
may act as barriers to entry. Our measure of plant size is the log total
employment at the median plant in the industry. Markups are defined
as shipments less variable costs divided by shipments, and the industry
14
Throughout the paper, industry refers to a 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification. We have dropped all industries with a code ending in the number 9,
as these typically group heterogeneous products not elsewhere classified. In addition, we drop SIC 21 due to the small number of firms. We are left with 387 out
of 449 industries.
15
A substantial number of very small plants do not receive a long form Census
questionnaire. We exclude these plants when we calculate our median industry
measures. They are included in the calculation of the industry and regional entry
and exit rates.

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 16

measure is again the value for the median plant. For our concentration
measure, we construct a Herfindahl index based on total shipments.
Turning our attention to the endowment data, we construct proxies for both physical and human capital intensity. Our measure of
capital intensity is log capital per worker.16 The only distinction of
labor varieties in the data are non-production and production workers.
Ideally, we would like to have a better measure of skilled or educated
workers at the plant but the limitations of the Census preclude a finer
measure. The main problem with the non-production worker share
is that it includes both high-education (engineers) and low-education
(janitors) workers. To obviate this problem as much as possible, in all
our empirical work, we use the wage share of non-production workers
instead of their employment share.
Perhaps the most interesting prediction from the Heckscher-Ohlin
model has to do with the interaction of changing regional endowment
and initial industry factor intensity. Since we are interested in regions that correspond to factor markets, we use the definition of a Labor Market Area (LMA) given by the Commerce Department rather
than US states or the coarser Census regions. LMAs can cross state
boundaries, as in the New York, NY LMA which includes parts of New
Jersey and Connecticut, or be contained within states, as in the San
Francisco-Oakland-San Jose LMA which covers only part of northern
California. These regions are based on county groups with common
commuting patterns recorded in the 1970 and 1980 population censuses. According to these definitions, there are 183 LMAs in the US
of which we use 181.17
16
Results from higher dimension trade theory suggest we should employ inputoutput ratios as our measure of factor intensity for the industry or plant, i.e. K
Q
where Q is value-added, rather than the capital-labor ratio, K
.
However,
across
L
industries and plants factor intensities vary inversely with multi-factor productivity levels and thus do not allow us to separately identify the role of factor usage
and productivity. We therefore choose to use the log capital-labor ratio and
non-production wage share in our empirical specifcations.
17
Over time commuting distances have lengthened and increasingly distant counties have become part of the same labor market. As a result of the 1990 census,

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 17

The trade model points to the importance of changes in factor
endowments of the regions and the interaction of those changes with
initial industry factor usage. In constructing measures of regional
factor endowments, we face two problems. First, we only observe
factors employed in manufacturing, a problem we cannot solve given
the data. Second, individual plant shutdowns might aﬀect regional
endowment measures. To avoid problems with endogeneity, when we
construct regional measures of relative factor endowments, we exclude
factor usage within the same two digit SIC.18 The variables of interest
are the changes in log capital-labor ratio and non-production wage
share for the LMA and the interactions of those changes with the
industry levels in the initial year.
3.1. Empirical Results (Industry)
For the industry level results, we estimate tobit specifications with
standard errors adjusted for potential heteroskedasticity within industries of the form
ERit = c + βICit + dt + eit
(4)
XRit = c + γICit + dt + ν it

(5)

N Rit = c + δICit + dt + ν it

(6)

where c is a constant, dt is a set of year dummies to control for aggregate factors such as business cycles, and ICit is vector of industry
characteristics.19
For industry entry rates, the H-O model predicts a positive coeﬃcient on the non-production wage share, our proxy for human capital
the number of labor market areas has been reduced to 172. Given the time span of
our data, we chose to work with the larger number of regions based on the earlier
censuses. We exclude Hawaii and Alaska from the analysis.
18
In other words, for a plant in two-digit industry Y in region 1, the change
in the regional K/L ratio is the change in the K/L ratio for all plants outside of
industry Y in region 1.
19
The tobits are necessary because some industries have truncated exit and entry
rates.

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 18

intensity. For physical capital the sign of the coeﬃcient is ambiguous.
Given the increase in capital intensity in the US during the period,
the H-O model predicts a positive correlation between physical capital
and entry rates. However, if physical capital intensity acts a barrier
to entry, then we would expect a negative correlation. Similarly, we
expect negative coeﬃcients on each of the market structure variables:
size, markup and concentration.
Expected coeﬃcients in the industry exit rate regressions should
be negative for all the variables. According to the endowment trade
model, exit rates should be lower for industries intensive in both physical and human capital as the US is becoming more capital and skill
intensive. Higher entry costs (size, markup, concentration, capital
intensity) should also reduce exit rates.
Table 1 reports the univariate tobits for each of the industry characteristics for both entry rates and exit rates. The non-production
wage share has the correct sign in both cases, with a significant positive coeﬃcient for industry entry rates and a negative, although insignificant, coeﬃcient in the exit specification. High skill industries
have higher entry and lower exit rates. The capital-labor ratio has the
expected negative and significant relationship with exit as predicted
by both the market structure and H-O trade models. Higher industry capital intensity is significantly negatively associated with entry
rates suggesting that the market structure eﬀects dominate. The size
and markup measures have the expected sign in both the entry and
exit rate specifications, although only the markup measure is not statistically significant for entry rates. The positive coeﬃcient on the
industry Herfindahl index for entry rates is at odds with the prediction
of the market structure models.
We report the results including all the measures in a single regression in Table 2. Again, with the exception of the concentration
measure, all the variables have the predicted signs and are significant
at the 1 percent level.20 Skill intensity is correlated with higher entry
20

The non-production wage share is significant only at the 10% level in the exit
specification.

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 19

rates and lower exit rates as suggested by the H-O trade model with
human capital accumulation. As predicted by the market structure
models, both entry and exit rates are lower in industries with larger
plants, higher markups and greater capital intensity.
One important distinction between the market structure and HO trade models is the implication for net entry rates. The market
structure models by construction have no net entry in steady state.
This suggests that measures such as size and markup should have no
relation to net entry rates. The H-O trade model, on the other hand,
focuses precisely on the changing composition of output in response
to factor accumulation. This model predicts that net entry rates
should be positively correlated with both physical and human capital
intensity.
Tables 3 and 4 report the results for industry net entry rates for
both the univariate and multivariate specifications. As predicted,
both physical and human capital intensity are positively correlated
with net entry rates at the industry level. The market structure
measures of plant size and markups are not significantly correlated
with net entry in either specification suggesting that they may indeed
be proxying for persistent industry characteristics that aﬀect both
entry and exit rates proportionately. The concentration measure does
not conform to the predictions of the model as it has a positive and
significant correlation with net entry.
3.2. Empirical Results (Region-Industry)
We turn now to the region-industry predictions of the H-O trade
model. As described above, we have 181 regions and 387 industries
in our data. Of course not every region contains a full range of
industries; on average only 47 percent of the region-industry cells have
active plants. There is a large amount of industry mixing both within
and across regions. As with the four-digit industries, entry and exit
rates are positively correlated across region-industry cells as shown in

Figure 7: Region-Industry Entry and Exit Rates, 1987-1992
Figure 7.21 However, only 30 percent of the variation in entry rates
can be explained by exit rates. In any given five year interval, 15
industries completely shut down and 20 new industries start up in the
average region. In this section, we consider two related components
of regional entry and exit. First, we consider exactly which regionindustry pairs are the most likely to experience entry, then we consider
magnitude of the entry, exit, and net entry rates in light of the two
types of models.
To understand where entry is occurring we estimate probits of the
form

21

(7)
Pr(ERirt > 0) = f (c + ICit + dt ) + eit
Pr(ERirt > 0) = f (c + δ∆RErt + dt ) + eit
Pr(ERirt > 0) = f (c + ICit + δ∆RErt + γ (∆RErt · ICit ) + dt ) + eit

Only region-industries cells with more than 20 plants and more than 10 firms
are shown.

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 21

where ICit is a vector of industry characteristics, ∆RErt is a vector
of changes in regional endowments (human and physical capital) and
∆RErt · ICit is a vector of interactions between regional endowment
changes and industry factor intensities.
We expect the probability of entry in a region-industry cell to
be increasing in industry capital intensities (H-O trade model), both
human and physical, and decreasing in the sunk cost of entry for the
industry proxied by plant size, markup, and concentration (market
structure model). As before the sign on industry log capital labor
ratio is ambiguous as it encompasses elements from both models. The
H-O trade model predicts that regions with larger increases in human
and physical capital will have higher entry (and exit) rates. For a
given region, entry will occur most often in industries with compatible
factor needs, i.e. regions with rapidly increasing physical and human
capital will see a higher probability of entry in high capital industries.
The expected signs on the interaction terms are positive.
Table 5 contains the results from the univariate and multivariate specifications. As expected, high industry non-production wage
shares are associated with a higher probability of entry. The measure
of industry capital intensity has a negative and significant coeﬃcient
suggesting, as in the industry results above, that capital intensity is
associated with high entry costs. Both the regional endowment measures are positive and significant at the 1 percent level. Regions with
increasing human and physical capital stocks are more likely to see
entry. Finally, among the proxies for entry costs, the size and concentration measures have the expected sign. Industries with high
markups, however, have higher, not lower probability of entry.
The last specification in Table 5 contains all the variables including
the interaction terms. Both the interaction terms have positive signs
and are significant at the 1 percent level exactly as predicted by the
H-O trade model with multiple regions. Indeed, all the variables have
the expected signs and most are significant at the 1 percent level.22
22

The coeﬃcients on the regional endowment changes are now negative. While
we expect the unconditional coeﬃcients to be positive, once we have added inter-

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 22

In Table 6, we report results for entry and exit rates for the regionindustry cells. We calculate entry and exit rates as in Equations 1
to 3. As mentioned above, there are large numbers of regions with
industries shutting down and starting up in every five year period. As
a result, our dependent variables will be censored on both ends. We
employ univariate and multivariate tobit estimators for entry and exit
rates of the form
Rirt = f (c + ICit + dt ) + eit
(8)
Rirt = f (c + δ∆RErt + dt ) + eit
Rirt = f (c + ICit + δ∆RErt + γ (∆RErt · ICit ) + dt ) + eit
with the variables defined as above.23
Both sets of estimates again largely conform to our priors from
the two models. In the univariate specifications, larger regional
endowment changes are positively associated with both exit and entry
rates as predicted by the H-O trade model. Higher skill shares have
positive and significant coeﬃcients for both entry and exit, the former
is predicted by the model while the higher exit rate is not consistent
with the H-O predictions. Industry capital intensity, median plant
size and concentration ratios are negatively correlated with both entry
and exit as in the industry regressions.24
In the multivariate specification, we find that again the industry
variables enter with the predicted signs and are usually significant at
the 1 percent level. Of particular interest are the interactions between
changes in regional endowments and industry factor intensities. For
both capital intensity and non-production wage share the interaction
terms have the expected signs and are all significant at least at the 5
percent level. Regions increasing human and physical capital gain
industries that are relatively human and physical capital intensive
at faster rates and lose labor intensive industries. Even within the
action terms we have no prior on the expected signs.
23
The tobit estimator relies heavily on the assumption of normality for consistency of the estimates.
24
The markup measure has the wrong sign and is significant for entry rates.

US, we see clear evidence that regional factor endowments aﬀect the
location and type of industries in the manner predicted by endowmentbased trade theory. These findings are confirmed in Table 7 where
we run tobits for net entry rates. Regions acquiring human and
physical capital have significantly higher net entry in capital-intensive
industries as predicted by the H-O model.
In this section, we have explored plant exit and entry across industries and regions. We confirm the well-known stylized fact that entry
rates and exit rates are positively correlated across industries. Using
the predictions of market structure models, we confirm that proxies
for entry cost are negatively correlated with both entry and exit rates
across industries. We show that net entry rates are substantial and
have significant variation across industries and regions.
To explain this industry heterogeneity in net entry, we turn to a
simple Heckscher-Ohlin model of trade. In a country that is accumulating both physical and human capital such as the US, the H-O model
predicts that industry capital intensity should be positively correlated
with net entry. We confirm this in the data and show that most
of the entry cost measures are uncorrelated with net entry, again as
predicted by the market structure models.
Finally, we consider regional variation in industry entry and exit
rates. While the market structure models are silent on where industries should locate, the H-O trade model predicts that increases
in regional capital intensity should be correlated with higher exit and
entry rates. We find significant evidence for this correlation. In addition, the H-O model predicts that entry in capital-deepening regions
should be in capital intensive industries and exit in labor intensive
industries. Once again we find support for this hypothesis.
This work at the industry and regional levels confirms the importance of the market structure models in explaining industry level
comovements in plant entry and exit rates. More importantly, we
introduce endowment-based trade theory as an important additional
component of the ongoing evolution of the US manufacturing sector.
While the market structure models had little role for net entry, a sim-

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 24

ple H-O trade model does well in not only predicting which industries
should see net entry but also where those capital-intensive industries
will locate.
4.

Conclusions

In this paper, we look at the restructuring of US manufacturing.
While previous work has focused on the positive correlation of plant
failures and births across industries, we concentrate on the variation in
net entry across both industries and regions. We document the large
degree of heterogeneity in net entry and develop testable predictions
from a simple endowment-based trade model.
Using the population of US manufacturing plants from 1972-1992,
we find strong support for the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin trade
model at the industry and regional level. The H-O trade model correctly predicts that capital and skill intensive industries should have
higher net entry rates than labor intensive industries in a country
that is accumulating skill and capital. The H-O model also contains
implications for regional variation in entry, exit, and net entry. Regions with rapidly changing endowments are correctly predicted to
have both higher entry and exit rates. In addition, the interactions
of regional endowment accumulation and industry factor intensity are
positively correlated with net entry rates. Regions accumulating capital have higher net entry in capital intensive industries. This means a
low-skill, labor-intensive plant in a region that is rapidly deepening its
capital stock is more likely to close than a high-skill, capital intensive
plant in the same region.
These results provide the first attempt to provide an explanation
for the substantial heterogeneity in net entry rates across industries in
the US manufacturing sector. A simple Heckscher-Ohlin trade model
does a good job of identifying the characteristics of industries and
regions associated with plant closure. Much work remains to be
done. The implications of endowment-based trade theory for dynamic
industry models have yet to be explored. In addition, future research

Who Dies? International Trade, Market Structure, and Industrial Restructuring 25

should consider more carefully the eﬀects of macroeconomic variables
such as exchange rate movements as well as the link between these
results on plant closure to issues of factor prices, especially wage levels
and inequality.
