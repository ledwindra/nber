    "abstract": "\n\nWe revisit the well-known negative association between union coverage and individuals\u2019 job satisfaction in the United States, first identified over forty years ago.  We find the association has flipped since the Great Recession such that union workers are now more satisfied than their non-union counterparts.  This is found to be the case for younger and older workers in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth of 1979 and 1997.  The change is apparent when we use the panel data to account for fixed differences in those who are and are not unionized, suggesting changes in worker sorting into union status are not the reason for the change.  The absence of substantial change in the union wage gap, and the stability of results when conditioning on wages, both suggest the change is not associated with changes in unions\u2019 wage bargaining. Instead, we find some diminution in unions\u2019 ability to lower quit rates \u2013 albeit confined to older workers - which is suggestive of a decline in their effectiveness in operating as a \u2018voice\u2019 mechanism for unionized workers. We also present evidence suggestive of unions\u2019 ability to minimize covered workers\u2019 exposure to underemployment, a phenomenon that has negatively impacted non-union workers.\n\n",
