Preventing Youth Violence and Dropout: A Randomized Field Experiment
Sara Heller, Harold A. Pollack, Roseanna Ander, and Jens Ludwig
NBER Working Paper No. 19014
May 2013
JEL No. I24,I3,K42
ABSTRACT
Improving the long-term life outcomes of disadvantaged youth remains a top policy priority in the
United States, although identifying successful interventions for adolescents – particularly males –
has proven challenging. This paper reports results from a large randomized controlled trial of an intervention
for disadvantaged male youth grades 7-10 from high-crime Chicago neighborhoods. The intervention
was delivered by two local non-profits and included regular interactions with a pro-social adult, after-school
programming, and – perhaps the most novel ingredient – in-school programming designed to reduce
common judgment and decision-making problems related to automatic behavior and biased beliefs,
or what psychologists call cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We randomly assigned 2,740 youth
to programming or to a control group; about half those offered programming participated, with the
average participant attending 13 sessions. Program participation reduced violent-crime arrests during
the program year by 8.1 per 100 youth (a 44 percent reduction). It also generated sustained gains in
schooling outcomes equal to 0.14 standard deviations during the program year and 0.19 standard deviations
during the follow-up year, which we estimate could lead to higher graduation rates of 3-10 percentage
points (7-22 percent). Depending on how one monetizes the social costs of crime, the benefit-cost
ratio may be as high as 30:1 from reductions in criminal activity alone.

I. INTRODUCTION
Improving the long-term life outcomes of disadvantaged youth remains a top policy
priority in the United States. The average four-year high school graduation rate in the 50 largest
urban school districts in America is just 53 percent (Swanson 2009). Nearly 70 percent of black
male dropouts will spend time in prison by their mid-30s (Western & Pettit 2010). Among males
ages 15-24, the homicide 2010 rate for blacks was 18 times that of whites (75 vs. 4/100,000).
Because homicide victims are disproportionately young, more years of potential life are lost to
homicide among black males than to the nation’s leading overall killer – heart disease.1
Long-term progress in addressing these problems has been limited, in part because
finding ways to improve outcomes for disadvantaged youth (particularly males) has proven
challenging.2 Despite technological changes that have increased the demand for educated
workers over time (Goldin & Katz 2008), the high school graduation rate in America has not
changed much since the 1970s.3 While mortality rates from almost every major leading cause of
death have declined dramatically over the past half century, the homicide rate today is not much
different from what it was in 1950 – or even in 1900 (Pinker 2011, p. 92).4
The persistence of these problems, and the limited success of previous social-policy
efforts, often lead to the conclusion that very intensive intervention is needed to overcome the

1

Figures are for years of potential life by 65. http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_injury_reports.html
For example, the U.S. Department of Education’s What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) does not give a single
dropout-prevention program its top rating of “strong effects” (defined as several randomized experiments or quasiexperiments all pointing in the same direction, or one large randomized experiment). The Coalition for EvidenceBased Policy does not list a single program for addressing high school graduation rates among its “Top Tier” of
programs. The evidence about how to reduce youth violence is not much stronger; see Appendix A for details.
3
While Heckman and LaFontaine (2010) show high school graduation rates were flat in the U.S. as a whole from
the 1970s through 2000, Murnane (2013) shows graduation rates have increased over the past 10 years. But the
share of those born in 1986-90 with a diploma is 84% - not much higher than the 81% for those born in 1946-50.
4
From 1950 to 2005, mortality rates declined by 45 percent from all causes, 64 percent from deaths due to heart
disease, 74 percent from cerebrovascular diseases, 58 percent from influenza and pneumonia, 50 percent for
unintentional injuries, and 20 percent for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Aside from homicide, the two other
exceptions to the long-run decline are cancer and diabetes mellitus (National Center for Health Statistics 2009).

powerful “root causes” that may drive adverse youth outcomes (see, for example, Garbarino
1999, Chapter 7). The social conditions most often implicated in discussions about adolescent
outcomes – economic disadvantage, under-performing public schools, the way children are
parented and socialized growing up – are all difficult to change, and their consequences may be
challenging to overcome. A related worry is that the effects of adverse social conditions may be
too entrenched by adolescence, so that interventions should focus more on early childhood when
people may be more malleable (Knudsen, et al. 2006; Shonkoff & Phillips 2000).
However, there may be a different piece of this problem that lends itself to lower-cost
policy intervention: The effects of disadvantaged social conditions on youth outcomes may be at
least partly mediated by errors in judgment and decision-making. Kahneman (2011) notes that all
of us rely on automatic, intuitive decision-making, which is sometimes generated from mistaken
inferences and beliefs. However the consequences may vary greatly by circumstance. The
likelihood of holding specific biased beliefs may also vary systematically within the population.
For example, Dodge and Pettit (1990) show that one cause of aggressive behavior is hypervigilance to threat cues and the tendency to over-attribute malevolent intent to others, or “hostile
attribution bias.” Like other theories of crime, social conditions play a role: This bias seems to be
more common among those from disadvantaged backgrounds, due partly to elevated risk of
having experienced abuse growing up. But now there is a mechanism that might be addressed
directly, not just a root cause. Many schooling decisions may stem from similar errors, given that
dropout is often precipitated by a disciplinary action or conflict with a teacher.
Our paper presents the results of a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) that took
place in 18 Chicago Public Schools (CPS) in some of the city’s most disadvantaged and
dangerous south and west side neighborhoods. We randomly assigned 2,740 male youth grades

4

7-10 to program or control conditions for the 2009-10 academic year. The intervention, called
“Becoming a Man” (BAM), was run by two local nonprofits, Youth Guidance (YG) and World
Sport Chicago (WSC). About half the youth assigned to treatment participated; the average
participant attended 13 one-to-two hour sessions.
The intervention’s components include regular exposure to pro-social adults, a key
ingredient for almost any social-policy intervention, after-school programming, and – perhaps
the most novel ingredient – cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a short-duration
intervention from psychology that helps people recognize and reduce unhelpful automatic
behaviors and biased beliefs – to promote “thinking about thinking” (meta-cognition). Since the
1970s, CBT has been used to address mental health disorders such as substance abuse, anxiety,
and depression, and indeed can be more effective than anti-depressant drug treatment (Rush, et
al. 1977). Since then, there has been growing practitioner interest in using CBT to address
socially-costly behaviors, though little good evidence currently exists about effects on those
behaviors of greatest policy concern such as delinquency, violence, and dropout.5 We measure
those outcomes during the program and a follow-up year using administrative data, which are not
subject to the same sample attrition and misreporting problems that often afflict survey data.
Using random assignment as an instrument for participation, we find that participation
reduced violent crime arrests by 8.1 arrests per 100 youth over the course of the program year, a
decline of 44 percent relative to participants’ control group counterparts. Arrests in our “other”
(non-violent, non-property, non-drug) category decreased by 11.5 arrests per 100 youth during

5

For example, a meta-analysis by Drake, Aos and Miller (2009) identified just a single “high-quality” experiment
carried out with youth, by Armstrong (2003), which found no significant effects on recidivism rates among juveniles
in a Maryland detention center. The lack of detectable impacts could mean that the intervention “doesn’t work,” but
could also be due instead to the modest sample size (110 treatment youth and 102 controls), or to the fact that the
treatment and control groups do not in fact appear to be comparable with respect to key baseline characteristics such
as share African-American, equal to 67 and 48 percent, respectively (see Appendix A for a review of this literature).

the program year, a decline of 36 percent, due mostly to reductions in weapons offenses together
with vandalism and trespassing. While these large arrest impacts did not persist, participation
also led to lasting gains in an index of schooling outcomes equal to 0.14 standard deviations (sd)
in the program year and 0.19sd in the follow-up year. Our sample is too young to have
graduated, but based on correlations from previous longitudinal studies of CPS students, we
estimate our schooling impacts could imply gains in graduation rates of 3-10 percentage points
(7-22 percent). With a cost of $1,100 per participant, depending on how we monetize the social
costs of violent crime, the benefit-cost ratio is up to 30:1 just from effects on crime alone.
The size of these effects, together with the modest “dosage,” suggests that even serious
youth outcomes may be more elastic to policy intervention than previous research would suggest.
While our reliance on administrative data necessarily limits our ability to isolate mechanisms, the
fact that previous programs that provide interactions with pro-social adults or after-school
activities tend not to show similarly large effects is at least suggestive evidence that the novel
ingredient here – CBT – may be important. Our results are not due just to “incapacitation” of
youth after school, since arrest impacts are at least as large on days when after-school
programming is not offered. We also have access to CPS student surveys that suffer from low
response rates, but provide at least suggestive evidence that the intervention may have improved
measures of perseverance (“grit”) and items related to conflict resolution and peer relationships.
As one juvenile detention staff member told us: “20 percent of our residents are
criminals, they just need to be locked up. But the other 80 percent, I always tell them – if I could
give them back just ten minutes of their lives, most of them wouldn’t be here.”6 Our results
suggest that it is possible to generate sizable changes in outcomes by helping disadvantaged

youth recognize their own thinking patterns and make better decisions during those crucial tenminute windows.
The next section briefly reviews some key characteristics of youth violence and dropout
behavior as a way to highlight the potential pathways through which our intervention may affect
youth outcomes. Section three describes the intervention we study. We discuss our study sample
in section four, program participation and “cross-over” in section five, data and outcomes in
section six, and analytic methods in section seven. Our main findings for crime and schooling are
in sections eight and nine. Extensions are in section ten, including evidence of robustness to how
we handle missing data and multiple comparisons, results by treatment arm, and tests for
treatment heterogeneity across students and schools. Section eleven discusses the evidence we
can assemble about mechanisms; section twelve presents benefit-cost estimates; and the final
section discusses limitations and implications.
II. YOUTH VIOLENCE AND DROPOUT
The factors that contribute to adverse youth outcomes, and the pathways through which
the intervention we study might help, are easiest to see with a concrete example. While examples
from education are plentiful, youth violence illustrates the key points in a particularly sharp way.
At 3pm on Saturday, June 2, 2012, in the South Shore neighborhood just a few miles
from the University of Chicago, two groups of teens were arguing in the street about a stolen
bicycle. As the groups began to separate, someone pulled out a handgun and fired, hitting a 16year-old named Jamal Lockett in the chest. Lockett was rushed up Lake Shore Drive to

7

Northwestern Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Two weeks later, prosecutors filed firstdegree murder charges against the alleged shooter, Kalvin Carter – 17 years old.7
The example illustrates many of the familiar social conditions thought to contribute to
youth violence: Chicago’s violence is disproportionately concentrated in economically and
racially segregated areas like South Shore, where 95 percent of residents are African-American,
27 percent are poor, and a majority of households with children contain only one parent.
Violence in general is disproportionately committed by young people when they are not under
adult supervision – particularly weekends and the afternoon hours when school lets out.8
The example is also representative with respect to its motivation, which highlights the
potential impact of CBT interventions that reduce errors in judgment and decision-making.
While media portrayals emphasize strategic, instrumental violence (for example, the shootings
committed by Snoop Pearson and Chris Partlow as part of Marlo Stanfield’s drug war against
Avon Barksdale in The Wire), as suggested by our example, this is not true of most violent
events: In Chicago, the site of our study, police believe that roughly 70 percent of homicides
stem from “altercations,” compared to only about 10 percent from drug-related gang conflicts.9
It is possible that many altercations such as the one described above escalate into
violence because youth are making intuitive, even automatic decisions, which Kahneman (2011)
suggests are common – but may not be adaptive in all circumstances, such as when a gun is
readily at hand. At 3pm on June 2 on the south side of Chicago, is Kalvin Carter thinking about
3:01 – or even consciously thinking at all, for that matter? Automatic, intuitive decision-making

In 2011, there were 433 Chicago homicides total. The motivations in 121 cases were unknown to the police; 219 of
the remaining 312 homicides were attributed by the police to an altercation (CPD 2011b).

is also susceptible to systematic biases, partly because the brain’s automatic “system” tends to
emphasize explanations that are coherent rather than necessarily correct. Examples of such errors
include hostile attribution bias (Kalvin Carter may have taken the denial of knowledge about the
stolen bicycle as evidence of deceit or disrespect, not innocence), confirmation bias (focusing on
information that confirms one’s preconceptions – perhaps ignoring conciliatory words by all but
one member of the other group), or catastrophizing (the tendency to think negative events are
even more negative than they are – perhaps Kalvin Carter thought “literally nothing is worse
than letting down my friends”).
It is also not hard to see how overly automatic behavior and biased beliefs could lead to
trouble in school. Hostile attribution bias cannot be helpful in a world in which teachers
sometimes raise their voices at students to start class or maintain discipline, and might contribute
to the sorts of disciplinary actions that often lead to school disengagement and eventually
dropout.10 Catastrophizing increases the risk that a student who has just received a low grade on
an exam might conclude he is incapable of high-school-level academic work, and give up.
The possible role of judgment and decision-making errors in explaining adverse youth
outcomes does not rule out a role for deficits in “non-cognitive” or “social-cognitive” skills as
well.11 But if the field’s experiences trying to improve academic skills are any guide, remediating
social-cognitive skill deficits may turn out to require very intensive intervention. Addressing

10

A qualitative study of youth in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) mobility experiment finds that disengagement
from school often follows a disciplinary action – that is, one mistake or over-reaction interacting with a peer or
teacher can start a process that ends in dropout (Clampet-Lundquist, DeLuca & Edin 2012). Rumberger (2001)
reviews data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 eighth graders and finds 39 percent said they
dropped out because they were ‘failing school;’ 29 percent ‘could not get along with teachers.’ Another 49 percent
said they ‘did not like school,’ and 27 percent of dropouts cited getting a job as a reason.
11
Research in psychology and economics shows non-academic skills are correlated with a range of life outcomes.
(see, for example, Borghans, et al. 2007; Bowles, Gintis & Osborne 2001; Cunha & Heckman 2007; Dodge 2003;
Heckman & Rubinstein 2001; Heckman, Stixrud & Urzua 2006; Moffitt, et al. 2011; Monahan, et al. 2009).

judgment and decision-making errors could potentially be amenable to lighter-touch (and hence
less costly) intervention, since the goal is largely recognition and awareness – epiphanies.
III. INTERVENTION
The intervention we study here, called “Becoming a Man” (BAM), was developed and
implemented by two Chicago-area non-profit organizations, Youth Guidance (YG) and World
Sport Chicago (WSC). It includes in-school and after-school programming that expose youth to
pro-social adults, occupy them during the high-risk hours after school, and implement aspects of
what psychologists call cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) designed to get youth to “think about
thinking” (promote meta-cognition): that is, to recognize situations in which automatic, intuitive
decision-making may lead to trouble and to recognize (and correct) biased beliefs or
interpretations of their experiences (Beck 2011).
The in-school treatment offered the chance to participate in up to 27 one-hour, once-perweek group sessions during the school day over the school year. The intervention is delivered in
groups to help control costs, with groups kept small (assigned groups of no more than 15 youth
and a realized average youth-to-adult ratio of 8:1) to help develop relationships. Students skip an
academic class in order to participate in the program, which is one of the draws for many youth
to attend. The program is manualized and can be delivered by college-educated people without
specialized training in psychology or social work, although YG had a preference for such
training in selecting program providers. From observing sessions, it also seems clear that another
skill essential to success is the ability to keep youth engaged.
The curriculum includes standard elements of CBT (Beck 2011), such as a common
structure to most sessions that starts with a self-analysis (“check in”) to help identify problematic
thoughts or behaviors to be addressed. Participants discuss a cognitive model emphasizing that

10

emotional reactions to events are endogenous and often influenced by automatic thoughts, and
are taught relaxation techniques to help avoid overly automatic reactions (“out of control”
behavior). Stories, movies, and metaphors are used to illustrate unhelpful automatic behaviors
and biased beliefs at work in the lives of others. Youth are taught to use “behavioral
experiments” to empirically test their biased beliefs, both during program sessions and as
homework in between sessions, with a special emphasis on common social-informationprocessing errors and problems around perspective-taking, such as catastrophizing and a focus
on overly narrow, short-term goals. Because monitoring automatic thoughts requires effort, CBT
helps focus this effort by helping people recognize indicators that some maladaptive automatic
thought or biased belief is being triggered. A shift to some aversive emotion is one common cue
(Beck 2011). Given the common risks for this population, a key focus was on anger as a cue.
The nature of the intervention is best illustrated by example. The very first activity for
youth in the program is the “Fist Exercise.” Students are divided into pairs; one student is told he
has 30 seconds to get his partner to open his fist. Then the exercise is reversed. Almost all youth
attempt to use physical force to compel their partners to open their fists. During debrief, the
group leader asks youth to explain what they tried and how it worked, pointedly noting that (as is
usually the case) almost no one has asked their partner to open their fist. When youth are asked
why, they usually provide responses such as: “he wouldn’t have done it,” or “he would have
thought I was a punk.” The group leader will then follow-up by asking: “How do you know?”
The exercise is an experiential way to teach youth about hostile attribution bias. The example
also shows how the program is engaging to youth who might not normally sign up for pro-social
activities, because it is slightly subversive – to participate they get out of an academic class, and
then the first activity winds up involving sometimes-rowdy horseplay.

11

The broader intervention also includes after-school programming delivered by WSC
designed to both enhance program participation rates and provide youth with more opportunities
to reflect on their automatic responses and decision-making. The WSC coaches all receive some
training in the BAM program. WSC sessions, one-to-two hours each, include non-traditional
sports (archery, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, handball, and martial arts) that require focus,
self-control, and proper channeling of aggression, and also provide youth with additional
opportunities for reflection on their automatic behavior (“so after you got hit in the face during
that boxing match, what were you thinking that led you to drop your hands and charge blindly?”)
IV. STUDY SAMPLE AND RANDOMIZATION
Our study setting – the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) – is similar to those of many other
large, urban school districts that serve disproportionately disadvantaged populations. Of the
409,000 students in the CPS system, 86 percent are low-income, and over 90 percent are racial or
ethnic minorities.12 Of students who begin 9th grade in CPS, only 51 percent graduate high school
within four years, about average for large urban school systems (Swanson, 2009), and only eight
percent graduate from a four-year college (Allensworth 2006). Chicago’s homicide rate is well
above the national average but middle of the pack for large U.S. cities.
During the summer of 2009, our team recruited 18 elementary and high schools in the
Chicago Public School (CPS) system located on Chicago’s low-income, racially segregated
South and West sides, where the city’s violent crime is disproportionately concentrated. Our
study sample is essentially the 2,740 highest-risk male students in grades 7-10 in the 18 CPS
study schools, after excluding students who rarely attend school (and so would not benefit from a
school-based intervention) or who have serious disabilities. This sample represents around 75
percent of all male youth in grades 7-10 in the study schools (see Appendix B for details).
12

12

Youth were randomized to treatment (in-school, after-school, or both) or control groups
within each school, so our design is a block-randomized experiment with schools as blocks.13
Our analyses control for school fixed-effects given the block-randomized design. One key
question for our study is whether any programming affects outcomes, and secondarily, which
elements matter most. It turns out that we do not have statistical power to distinguish among the
three treatment arms, a problem compounded by treatment cross-over (described below). For
these reasons, and because all three arms share the same larger goals, our main results focus on
the effect of all three arms pooled together. We also present results by treatment arm below.
Table I shows that ours is a very disadvantaged sample. The average age at baseline was
15, with over half being old for grade. Reflecting the composition of their neighborhoods, all of
our study youth are minorities – around 70 percent black, the remainder Hispanic. During the
pre-randomization year (AY 2008-9), the average youth had a GPA of 1.7 on a 4.0 scale and
attended 130 out of a total possible 170 school days. Over one-third of study youth had been
arrested at least once prior to randomization.
The similarity of baseline characteristics between treatment and control groups in Table I
suggests that randomization was successful. Of 19 total baseline covariates we examined,14 none
of the treatment-control differences is significantly different at the 5 percent level. An F-test for
the joint significance of all available baseline characteristics shows we cannot reject the null
hypothesis that treatment and control groups are equivalent (F(19,2542)=1.05, p=.397).
V. PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND CROSS-OVER RATES

13

Three of our 18 schools could not accommodate after-school programming because of logistical or space reasons,
so they included only in-school and control conditions. Eight schools offered both in- and after-school treatment
arms in some combination, but did not offer all three treatment arms in addition to the control group.
14
The other baseline variables not shown in Table I are: number of in-school suspensions, number of out-of-school
suspensions, and each of the number of grades earned (A through F).

13

Table II shows that around half of youth offered the chance to participate in program
activities chose to participate. This take-up rate is consistent with other large scale social
experiments (Bloom, et al. 1997; Kling, Liebman & Katz 2007) despite the fact that we
randomized first (using administrative data) and then tried to consent people for program
participation, rather than consenting and then randomizing, as is more common.15 We suspect
participation rates for the after-school programming are under-stated because of inadequate
record keeping; below, we bound the impact of this under-reporting on our estimated effect of
participating. Among participants, the average number of sessions attended is around 13.
Figure I highlights one hard-to-avoid byproduct of running social experiments in
challenging circumstances like those in the CPS system: namely, some control group youth wind
up participating in program activities (“control-group cross-over”). We analyze the data using
original treatment or control assignments to preserve the strength of the experimental design.
Figure I also shows that there is treatment-group cross-over as well. For example, fully one-third
of participants among the youth assigned to receive only after-school programming wound up
receiving in-school programming. Among those youth offered both activities, more received just
in-school programming only than received both activities.
VI. OUTCOME MEASURES
Our main schooling outcomes come from longitudinal student-level CPS records for the
pre-program year (AY 2008-9), program year (AY 2009-10), and follow-up year (AY 2010-11).
Our sample was drawn from CPS data on the pre-program year and then matched to data from
subsequent years using CPS student ID numbers. We used the post-randomization data to form a
summary index of schooling outcomes, which reduces the number of hypothesis tests and so
reduces risk of “false positives” (Anderson 2008; Kling, Liebman & Katz 2007; Westfall &
15

Consent was for program participation only; outcome data is available for all youth who were randomized.

Young 1993). It also improves the statistical power available to detect effects for outcomes
within a given family expected to move in a similar direction. Below we show this is indeed true
of the elements of our index, which is an (unweighted) average of days present, GPA, and
persistence in school (enrollment status at the end of the academic year), each normalized to Zscores using the control group’s distribution (Appendix C has additional details).16
While we can determine enrollment status for each student in every year, the share of
students missing at least one of the other elements of our index grows over time from 10 percent
in the program year to 33 percent during the follow-up year. For individuals missing some
element(s) of the composite, but who have valid information for at least one component, we
follow Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007) and assign the group (treatment or control) mean for the
missing elements. This approach has the advantage of using all available information and has a
straightforward interpretation: it is equivalent to estimating the treatment effect on each
component of the index (in standardized form) using only observations with non-missing
observations, and then averaging the component-specific estimates. Below we demonstrate that
our results are generally robust to alternative ways of handling missing data.
To measure criminal behavior by program participants, we use electronic arrest records
(or “rap sheets”) from the Illinois State Police (ISP), which were matched to our study sample
for research purposes by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) using
probabilistic matching on name and date of birth. Arrest records avoid the problem of underreporting of criminal involvement in survey data (Kling, Ludwig & Katz 2005) but require the
assumption that the intervention itself does not affect the likelihood that criminal behavior results
16

Our index of schooling outcomes does not include standardized test scores. By design, CPS does not administer
standardized tests to all grades (particularly older grades). Thus, more than half of all students in our study sample
are missing test scores (similar shares for treatment and control groups). Our index also does not include
administrative records on school disciplinary actions; we have received conflicting accounts from different sources
about whether disciplinary actions are inconsistently reported and recorded in CPS data, even within schools.

15

in arrest. The ISP records capture arrests in the state going back to 1990 and include arrests of
people below the age of majority within the criminal justice system (juvenile arrests), as well as
to those who are above the age of majority. Local police departments are required by law to
report all juvenile felony arrests to the ISP, and optionally class A and B misdemeanors. Because
intervention impacts often vary greatly by crime type (Deming 2011; Evans & Owens 2007;
Kling, Ludwig & Katz 2005; Lochner & Moretti 2004; Weiner, Lutz & Ludwig 2009), as do
social costs, we examine arrests separately for four different offense categories: violent,
property, drug, and “other” (excluding motor vehicle violations).
VII.

ANALYSIS APPROACH

The main challenge in identifying the effects of social-policy interventions is selection –
those youth who select into (or are selected for) participation may be systematically different
from non-participants in ways that also directly affect outcomes. We overcome this problem with
a randomized control group, which lets us identify the average outcomes the treatment group
would have experienced had they not been offered the program.
Let Yist denote some post-program outcome for individual i at school s during postrandomization period t, which is a function of treatment group assignment (Zis) and observed
variables from ISP and CPS records measured at or before baseline (Xis(t-1)) as in equation (1)
below. We control for the blocking variable with school fixed effects (γs). The “Intent-To-Treat
effect” (ITT) captures the effect of being offered the chance to participate in the program, and is
given by the estimate of π1 in equation (1). We condition on baseline characteristics to improve
precision by accounting for residual variation in the outcomes (results without baseline

16

covariates are similar; available upon request).17 Our main tables present results for the treatment
arms pooled together (see Section V), but later we also show results separately as well.18
(1)

Yist = Zisπ1 + Xis(t-1)β1 + γs + εist1

The advantage of the ITT estimand is that it fully exploits the strength of the randomized
experimental design. But since not all youth participate, the ITT will understate the effects of
actually participating in the program. We therefore also report the effect of participating in the
program for those who actually participate, which we estimate using two-stage least squares with
random assignment (Zis) as an instrumental variable (IV) for participation (Pist), as in equations
(2) and (3) (Angrist, Imbens & Rubin 1996; Bloom 1984). This assumes treatment-group
assignment has no effect on the behavior of youth who do not participate in the intervention.
(2)

Pist = Zisπ1 + Xis(t-1)β1 + γs + εist2

(3)

Yist = Pistπ2 + Xis(t-1)β2 + γs + εist3

If youth respond differently to the intervention, then because some of our controls wind
up in the program, π2 is a local average treatment effect (LATE) – the effect of the program
(treatment) on those whose treatment receipt is affected by being assigned to the treatment rather
than control group, or “compliers” (Angrist, Imbens & Rubin 1996; Imbens & Rubin 1997;
Imbens & Angrist 1994)). Because control cross-over rates are low, we expect the LATE should
be fairly close to the effect of treatment on the treated. The IV results are essentially equal to the
17

Specifically, we control for the following variables from the 2008-9 academic year: total days present; number of
in- and out-of-school suspensions; number of each grade category (A, B, C, D, and F); dummies for ages 14-15, 1516, and over 17; black and Hispanic dummies; an indicator for having an Individual Educational Program (IEP); a
linear grade term; and dummies for having zero, one, two, or three and over arrests of each type. For the one case
with missing baseline covariates, we assign a value of zero and include an indicator that the variable is missing.
18
One slight complication in estimating equation (1) is the possibility that the outcomes of students attending the
same school might be correlated. The fact that equation (1) conditions on school fixed effects accounts for withinschool correlations across students in mean outcomes. Yet it is still possible that higher order moments are
correlated within schools (e.g., school-level variances may be heteroskedastic). Clustering standard errors on schools
would account for any remaining correlation across error terms. However, with only 18 clusters, the asymptotic
theory on which clustering is based is not applicable. Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008) show the wild-t bootstrap
performs well with a small number of clusters; as a sensitivity test, we also show p-values from this method.

17

ITT effect on outcomes divided by the ITT effect on intervention participation rates, varying
somewhat due to covariate adjustment. With participation rates of 49 percent for youth assigned
to treatment and 5 percent for controls, the IV estimate will be about 2.3 times the ITT.
One complication is that we suspect that there might have been some under-reporting of
participation in the after-school programming, which would lead the IV estimate to overstate the
effects of participation by under-estimating the number of compliers over whom the ITT impact
should be allocated. As a check on how large this over-statement could be, we also present
results that assume the participation rate for after-school programming in every school is equal to
the rate we see in the school with the highest after-school take-up rate (70 percent). This surely
over-states participation rates, and so serves as a lower-bound on the effects of participation.19
To help judge the magnitude of our IV estimates, we also estimate the average outcomes
of those youth in the control group who would have complied with treatment had they been
assigned to treatment – or the “control complier mean” (CCM) (see Katz, Kling & Liebman
2001), which could differ from the overall control mean. Katz, Kling, and Leibman’s original
formulation of the CCM is in a setting where there is no control crossover (no “always-takers”).
If C indicates being a “complier” and Z indicates treatment assignment, the CCM equals:
(4)

CCM = E(Y|C=1, Z=1) – [E(Y|C=1, Z=1) – E(Y|C=1, Z=0)].

The term in brackets is our LATE estimate. However, we must recover the first righthand-side term, E(Y|C=1, Z=1), since what we observe in the data is the mean outcome for all
treatment group participants - a weighted average of the mean outcomes for compliers and
always-takers. Let P indicate actual participation and A be an indicator for always-takers. Then:

19

We randomly select non-participants to reassign as participants until the target “participation rate” is reached. We
also re-calculated the IV assuming that within each school, the participation rates were actually the same for afterschool and in-school programming, which is usually bounded by the other two approaches (available upon request).

To recover E(Y|Z=1, C=1) for the CCM calculation, we can estimate the left-hand side
and E(P|Z=1) directly from the data, and use random assignment to replace E(A|Z=1) with
E(A|Z=0) and E(Y|Z=1, A=1) with E(Y|Z=0,A=1).20 In other words, we assume treatment- and
control-group always-takers are equivalent on average.
A few final methodological issues that arise in our analysis have to do with whether our
results are sensitive to alternative approaches for handling missing outcome data or adjustments
to our hypothesis tests for multiple comparisons (they are not), and our approach for examining
how impacts may vary across schools and individual program providers as a way to think about
the generalizability and scalability of this intervention. We discuss our approach to all three of
these issues in Section X below, together with the results of those analyses.
VIII.

CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR

Table III shows that the program generates very large reductions in arrests for violent
crimes and “other” crimes during the program year (arrests made between 9/09 through 8/10),
which are no longer statistically significant in the follow-up year (arrests that occur from 9/10
through 7/11). The top panel shows that during the program year, program participation reduces
violent-crime arrests by about 8 per 100 youth, equal to about 44 percent of the CCM (18 per
100 youth). Even the lower-bound estimate for the IV, which assumes a high-end program
participation rate, implies a 32 percent reduction. This result is statistically significant, even
using the wild-t bootstrap (p<0.04). Violent crime, dominated by assaults, is the offense category
we would perhaps expect to be most strongly affected by an intervention with a major emphasis

20

In our case, block randomization means that these equalities should also be conditional on school. In practice, the
difference that calculating them conditionally makes is trivial.

19

on reducing overly automatic angry behavior and mistakes reading other people’s intentions.
(Violent-crime arrest rates are high relative to the other crime categories in Table III, which may
be due partly to the better coverage in the ISP data of juvenile felonies versus misdemeanors).
The top panel’s last row shows that program participation reduces the number of arrests
for “other” (non-violent, non-property, non-drug) crimes by nearly 12 arrests per 100 youth
during the program year, about a 38 percent reduction relative to the CCM (32 per 100). This
impact is driven by reductions in weapons offenses, trespassing, and vandalism (each account for
about one-quarter of the total effect). Arrests for disorderly conduct or disobeying a police
officer, which together account for over a third of all arrests in this “other” category and could in
principle have declined simply because youth are now just better able to interact more
constructively with law enforcement, appear to be basically unaffected.
The bottom panel shows that for the follow-up year, none of the impact estimates is
statistically significant. The impact on “other crimes” is still large in proportional terms, equal to
over one-third of the CCM, but is not quite statistically significant (t=1.61). Arrests decline for
our sample from year 1 to 2, consistent with declines in overall Chicago crime over this period.21
Our results are robust to modifications to our estimation approach (Appendix Table A2).
For example, when we lower the probabilistic-match-quality threshold for what counts as a rapsheet “match,” the results are generally similar but slightly attenuated, as we would expect from

21

For example, the overall rate of Chicago homicides (the best-measured crime) declined by 10% from 2008 to
2009, by 6% from 2009 to 2010, and by another 1% from 2010 to 2011. Declines in youth homicide arrests are even
more pronounced. There were 15 homicide arrests to 14-16 year olds in 2008 and just 11 in 2011, and 164 among
17-25 year olds in 2008 and just 91 in 2011 (CPD 2011b). From 2009 to 2010 (the last year for which other crime
data are available in Chicago) robbery rates declined by 10% and aggravated assault rates declined by 8.5%, while
property-crime arrests were basically unchanged (0.4% drop) (CPD 2011a).

20

including more false-positive arrests. We also find similar results using a quasi-maximum
likelihood Poisson count data model (Wooldridge 1999) rather than OLS. 22
IX. SCHOOLING RESULTS
Table IV shows that the program improves schooling outcomes during both the program
year (AY 2009-10) and the follow-up year (AY 2010-11). We show results for our index
followed by each element, all in Z-score form (results in raw units are in Appendix Table A1).
The estimated effect of participation on our schooling index during the program year (top panel)
is a statistically significant .14SD, with a lower bound of 0.09SD using a conservative
adjustment for the potential of attendance under-reporting. The statistical significance of our
results is robust to using a wild-t bootstrap to calculate p-values (p<.034). The CCM during the
program year is positive (0.218), compared to a control mean that is zero by construction,
suggesting that youth who are relatively more school-oriented tend to be the ones who choose to
participate when offered. The rest of the top panel shows qualitatively similar impacts on each
standardized element of our schooling index. Although GPA is the only element significant on
its own, the p-values for the other two elements are just barely above the 10 percent level. Using
a composite improves our statistical power.
It is worth noting that while the treatment and control mean values for GPA were similar
at baseline (Table I), as the first panel of Figure II shows, the variance of the baseline GPA
distribution is a bit smaller for the treatment than control group. Specifically, youth assigned to
treatment had 0.18 more C’s during the pre-program year (p = 0.06) and 0.12 fewer A’s (p =

22

The QMLE estimates are slightly less precise due to the use of a parsimonious set of covariates to ensure
convergence, but the results are almost identical to OLS. Focusing on the main estimate for violent crime, and using
only baseline age dummies and the total number of baseline arrests as covariates, the QMLE Poisson coefficient is 0.2011 (p=.085). In other words, assignment to the treatment group (the ITT effect) reduces violent crime arrests by
about 20 percent. By comparison, the ITT estimate using the same covariates is -0.0328 (p = 0.052); a 19.7 percent
reduction in arrests relative to the control mean of 0.167.

21

0.13) than their control counterparts.23 However, the treatment-control difference in GPA
distributions during the program year (shown in the second panel of Figure II) does not appear to
be due to this sampling variation. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the equality of distributions,
adjusting for school fixed effects, shows that the baseline grade distributions are not significantly
different at baseline (p=0.335), but are statistically different the year of the program (p=0.022).
The bottom panel of Table IV shows that the impact on schooling outcomes persists
through the follow-up year, and is, if anything, slightly larger than the impact observed during
the program year (IV estimates of 0.19SD versus 0.14SD, respectively).
X. ADDITIONAL ROBUSTNESS CHECKS AND EXTENSIONS
This section shows that our results are generally robust to using different approaches to
handle missing data on our schooling outcomes and accounting for the number of hypothesis
tests we presented in the preceding two sections. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
effects are the same across treatment arms, and that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
effects are similar across schools as well – although these are fairly low-powered tests. We also
find suggestive evidence that more disadvantaged students may benefit more from the program.
A. Different Approaches to Handling Missing Data on Schooling Outcomes
Table V shows that our results are fairly robust to how we handle missing data on
schooling outcomes during the program year (top panel), and the follow-up year (bottom panel),
which is perhaps not surprising given that the share of observations with missing data on either
the GPA or days-attended variables in our schooling index is nearly identical for the treatment
and control groups (10 percent during the program year, and 33 percent during the follow-up
year, with no missing data on the school enrollment element of the index by construction).

23

As discussed below, simulations suggest a substantial probability of observing at least one unbalanced baseline
outcome such as this that arises through chance rather than through randomization failure.

22

Missing data is not an issue we can explore with the “rap sheets” we use to measure arrests,
which cannot distinguish between missing data and someone who has just never been arrested.
The first row of Table V reproduces our main results, which follow Kling, Liebman, and
Katz (2007) (KLK) and assign the relevant treatment or control group mean to youth with
missing values on any element (essentially averaging the results of separate regressions on each
of the index elements using just non-missing elements of each index). This approach assumes
elements of our outcome index are missing completely at random (MCAR), that is, for reasons
uncorrelated with observed or unobserved attributes of youth in the study.24 MCAR is a testable
assumption that seems to fail in our application,25 perhaps because CPS data on grades and
attendance can be missing because youth attend or transfer into particularly low-performing
schools with poor record-keeping, transfer to private or suburban schools, or drop out.
The remainder of Table V presents the results of alternative approaches to dealing with
missing data that generally yield qualitatively similar results to those from our main approach.
The second row shows that the results of using just observations with non-missing values on all
elements of the index (list-wise deletion) and controlling for baseline covariates, which also
assumes MCAR. Row three again uses complete cases but re-weights the data so the distribution
of baseline characteristics in this sample is similar to what we see in the full study sample. This
approach assumes that the data are missing at random (MAR), i.e., in ways that are related to
youth observable characteristics but not unobserved determinants of outcomes. The results are
slightly smaller than our main findings with slightly larger standard errors. The next two rows of

24

While we do control for baseline covariates, this is not enough to account for correlation between baseline
covariates and data missingness, because the ITT or LATE estimates are averages across different cells defined by
the baseline covariates. So if some baseline covariate values are over-represented among those observations with
missing outcome data, the estimated effect on that sub-sample will be under-represented in the overall estimate.
25
Regressing an indicator for having non-missing values on all three index elements on baseline covariates produces
a global F-statistic of 3.57 (p<0.0000) for the program year and 15.52 for the post-program year (p<0.0000).

23

Table V use logical imputation.26 The last row of each panel presents the results from a multiple
imputation (MI) approach with m = 10 imputed data sets, which again assumes MAR and yields
quite similar estimates (see Appendix D for details).
A final approach we employ to deal with missing data in our CPS schooling outcomes is
bounding, motivated by the recognition that even the MAR assumption need not hold. The
bounds that we calculate using the trimming procedure from Lee (2009) are still consistent with
the idea of large treatment effects on schooling outcomes but, perhaps not surprisingly, have
wider confidence intervals than we find for our main estimates, and which now include zero.27
B. Multiple Testing Adjustments
As more hypotheses are tested, the probability of at least one false rejection increases.
While we have tried to reduce risk of Type I error by minimizing the number of outcomes we
examine and by using a large sample size, we use two additional methods to test the robustness
of our results to multiple hypothesis testing concerns (see detailed discussion in Anderson 2008).
The first method controls the family-wise error rate (FWER), or the probability that at
least one of the true null hypotheses in a family of hypothesis tests is rejected, using a free-step
down resampling method to adjust our p-values to account for multiple inference concerns.28 Our

26

For our logical imputation we first fill in zeros for all missing grades and attendance information under the
extreme assumption that all missing data are due to dropout; in the following row, we set grades and attendance to
zero only in those cases where the enrollment variable is zero and the CPS leave codes (which themselves may be
subject to some error) suggest the student dropped out (and using the KLK approach otherwise).
27
In calculating these bounds, we consider an observation non-missing only if all three academic components of the
index are non-missing. In year 1, 0.023 more treatment youth than control youth have non-missing indexes; in year 2
the difference rises to 0.046. Trimming off the pth and 1- pth quantiles results in a lower bound treatment effect in
year 1 of 0.0195 (0.0334) and an upper bound treatment effect of 0.1019 (0.0607) (standard errors in parentheses).
For year 2, the analogous bounds are 0.0037 (0.0443) and 0.1613 (0.0607). Using Lee’s preferred confidence
interval construction, this implies that the true academic treatment effect in year 1 is between -0.035 and 0.1699, and
in year 2 is between -0.0692 and 0.2613. However, there are indications that the monotonicity assumption on which
this strategy relies may not hold, see Appendix D for discussion.
28
Specifically, we use a bootstrap resampling technique that simulates data under the null hypothesis (Westfall &
Young 1993). Within each permutation, we randomly re-assign treatment and control indicators with replacement
and estimate program impacts on all five of our main outcomes (the schooling index and our four main arrest
categories). By repeating this procedure 100,000 times, we create an empirical distribution of t-statistics that allows

24

bootstrap resampling approach suggests we would observe an effect as extreme as the one on the
schooling composite by chance only 3.8 percent of the time. So we can confidently reject the null
hypothesis that the intervention effects are jointly zero.29 Given how little we know about
improving life outcomes for disadvantaged youth, especially boys, this is a key finding.
While the FWER-adjusted p-value on violent crime arrests (unadjusted p=0.04) is equal
to p=0.16, which suggests some caution in interpreting the violent crime results, the FWER
control method is somewhat conservative in trading off power in exchange for minimizing the
chance of even one type I error. A different approach is to control the false discovery rate (FDR),
or the proportion of null-hypothesis rejections that are type I errors (Anderson 2008; Benjamini
& Hochberg 1995). For our group of five hypothesis tests, we can set the acceptable expected
proportion of type I errors (call this q, which is FDR control’s p-value analog), then test whether
we can reject each null hypothesis at the acceptable q- level. Using the two-stage FDR-control
procedure from Benjamini, Krieger & Yekutieli (2006),30 we can reject the null of no violentcrime arrest effects at q = 0.1. In other words, as long as we are willing to accept that 10 percent

us to compare the actual set of t-statistics we find to what we would have found by chance under the null. We
maintain the original sampling frame for each iteration, blocking on schools and assigning the same number of
pseudo-treatment and pseudo-control youth as in our original sample. This technique preserves the correlational
structure and underlying distributions of our data, providing the adjusted probability we would observe our results
by chance given our data and the number of tests we run. Rather than use a single p-value adjustment for all the
outcome measures, we use a free step-down procedure to adjust the p-value on each outcome separately. The idea is
that once a null hypothesis has been rejected via the bootstrap resampling method, it is removed from the family of
hypotheses being tested (thus increasing the power of the remaining tests). We then calculate a new adjusted p-value
with the bootstrapped empirical distribution of t-statistics for only the remaining tests, providing a more powerful
adjustment than setting all p-values to the same minimum value.
29
This bootstrap resampling technique also suggests that the one marginally significant baseline imbalance we see
in our data is due to chance, not randomization failure. Specifically, the chance of seeing at least one statistically
significant treatment-control difference at the 5 percent level out of 19 baseline measures (we see one difference just
over that level for number of C’s, with β = 0.18, p = 0.06) is 62 percent.
30
The authors show that this method sharpens the original formulation of FDR control as long as p-values are either
independent or positively correlated. We expect that our p-values are positively correlated in this case. The intuition
of the original test is as follows: suppose there are M hypotheses, r of which are rejected. Starting with the largest pvalue, check if p < (q*r)/M. If not, continue to the next largest p-value. Once a p-value satisfies this inequality, reject
that null hypothesis and all hypotheses with p-values smaller than that one. This method controls the FDR at level q.

25

of our rejections will be type I errors in expectation, our violent crime results are robust to
adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing.
C. Effects by Treatment Arm
This section shows that the ITT effects across treatment arms appear to be fairly similar
to one another. We have focused up to now on pooling the three treatment arms together, in part
for improved statistical power, in part because treatment-group cross-over (Figure I) makes it
hard to learn about specific mechanisms by comparing effects of different treatment arms, and in
part because the coaches involved in after-school programming received BAM training and were
encouraged to deploy those skills during the after-school programming. We focus here on
comparing the ITT across arms rather than the IV because instrumenting for “participation” by
arm is complicated by the differential under-reporting of attendance across arms.31
Table VI shows that the ITT effects are fairly similar across treatment arms; we cannot
reject the null that they are the same. A different approach (Appendix Table A3) assumes that the
effects of in-school and after-school programming are additive and regress outcomes against an
indicator for being assigned to in-school and after-school, so that youth assigned to both have
both indicators turned on. Again we cannot reject the null that the coefficients are the same.
The similarity of these ITT effects across treatment arms is another reason that we
suspect that the recorded participation rate for the after-school-only group (21 percent) is too
low. Since around half the youth in the other groups participated, for the 21 percent participation
rate to be correct, the after-school programming would have to be far more effective per
participant than the effects of either in-school programming alone or even than the combination
of in-school and after-school programming.
31

When we instrument for participation in each activity type with the three treatment-arm dummies, we cannot
reject that the effects of the in-school and after-school activities are the same. This is true regardless of whether we
use the participation data as-is or our bounding approach that adjusts for after-school under-reporting.

26

D. Treatment heterogeneity
When we interact different baseline characteristics of youth with treatment assignment,
we generally find few statistically significant differences across identifiable sub-groups of youth
in estimated impacts. One possible exception is that schooling impacts might be relatively larger
for youth who were towards the bottom of the baseline GPA distribution (below a D), who
experienced an impact on the schooling index of 0.11 standard deviations (p=0.027) compared to
a statistically insignificant 0.026SD change (p=0.314) for students with higher baseline GPAs
(Appendix Table A4). The table also shows that the program year’s decrease in violent crime
appears to be concentrated among those who had not yet been arrested for a violent crime at
baseline (β= -0.0818, p = 0.050, versus for those who had already been arrested for a violent
crime at baseline, β = 0.030, p = 0.417). We should, however, be cautious interpreting these
findings, given the number of hypothesis tests involved in testing all the interaction effects.
A different concern is that the effectiveness of programs that seek to develop human
capital may vary considerably by the individual program provider, or across settings, so that
scaling-up the results might be challenging. To explore this possibility – at least to the extent
possible within a single study – we take advantage of the fact that our intervention was carried
out by 13 different individuals for the in-school programming and 21 different after-school
coaches, across 18 CPS schools that differ by racial and ethnic composition, poverty rates,
academic achievement, and a variety of other characteristics. We find little statistical evidence
that treatment effects differ across schools using either ordinary least squares or hierarchical
linear modeling (which some researchers prefer because of the efficiency gain that comes from
precision-weighting the school blocks); see Appendix E for details. Given that we have only 18
schools, it should be noted that this is a fairly low-power test. With that qualification in mind,

27

and recognizing that replication would provide the strongest evidence about external validity, we
cannot reject the null hypothesis that effects are similar on average across schools.32
XI. MECHANISMS
Given our research design and reliance on administrative data, our ability to isolate the
key mechanisms of action behind the sizable behavioral impacts we document here is somewhat
limited. We can rule out after-school incapacitation as the sole reason behind the observed arrest
impacts. The available survey data we have from CPS, while imperfect, provide at least
suggestive evidence that the intervention changes self-reported persistence and peer relationships
or conflict resolution. Our data have little to say directly about other candidate channels such as a
generic mentoring effect (or exercise or program-induced change in peers), aside from noting
that other interventions with these elements do not appear to be as successful as this one.
The arrest data are not consistent with the idea that crime impacts are due solely to the
program incapacitating youth during high-risk after school hours. We observe the date of each
arrest and also know the dates of each after-school session. We find that the estimated effect is
not concentrated on days in which after-school programming is concentrated, which is not
consistent with incapacitation being the major mechanism behind arrest impacts.33
A second possible mechanism that may be at work is the role of mentorship. It may be
that having a positive, pro-social adult consistently checking in with, advising, and advocating
for a youth can improve his schooling and crime outcomes. This is possible, especially during
the program year, although the fact that the observed schooling gains persist through the year

32

We find that the treatment effect’s variance is quite small: 0.00005 for the program year academic treatment
effect, 0.0002 for the follow-up year academic treatment effect, and 0.0003 for the violent crime arrest effect.
33
The ITT effect on an indicator for any violent-crime arrest during days when after-school programming is not
offered is β = -0.0217 (se=0.0103), p = 0.035, CM 0.046, vs. days after-school programming is offered, β = -0.0061
(0.0076), p = 0.420, CM = 0.094). These estimates do not adjust for the larger number of non-programming days.

28

after the program, when students were no longer interacting with those adults, suggests increased
supervision and mentoring might not be the only mechanism at work.
The best available outside evidence on this mechanism probably comes from the
randomized experimental studies of the Big Brothers / Big Sisters (BB/BS) mentoring program,
although these rely on self-reported survey data and so may confound behavioral effects with
effects on willingness of youth to admit bad behavior. In any case, the findings are somewhat
mixed. An initial RCT of BB/BS community-based mentoring for children ages 10-16 found
evidence of beneficial effects on schooling outcomes like GPA and attendance, and some
behavioral measures such as drug and alcohol use or hitting someone else (but not theft or
property damage) (Grossman & Tierney 1998). The BB/BS study finds few effects when
examining our study sample (minority males). A more recent study of BB/BS mentoring done
within schools with children 10-16 (Herrera, et al. 2011) found effects on some schooling
outcomes during the program year that did not persist to the follow-up year, and found no
statistically significant effects on out-of-school behavioral outcomes.
A more subtle way in which the intervention could have increased supervision and
mentoring of youth is by reducing school-switching. Table VII shows that during the program
year, the likelihood of changing schools within the CPS system was about 50 percent lower for
program participants. Reduced school mobility could have improved youth outcomes both
because changing schools is directly disruptive, and because youth who stay in the same school
may be more likely to have or develop relationships with school staff. Table VII also shows
participants are about half as likely to have attended a CPS school in the criminal justice system
(juvenile detention or prison, or adult jail or prison) the year after the program. If incarceration
has adverse effects on youth, this impact could be a mediator for lasting changes in school

29

engagement. This could also be a behavioral outcome in its own right, or simply a mechanical
(but substantively important) after-effect of the reduction in violent-crime arrests during the
program year itself, since the decision about whether to detain a youth after arrest in Cook
County is based on a formula that includes a youth’s prior criminal record as one input.
Our final source of information about potential mechanisms, including possible effects on
judgment and decision-making, comes from surveys completed by CPS students in spring 2011,
the end of the year after our intervention. These on-going, bi-annual surveys are carried out over
the web by the Consortium on Chicago School Research and are designed to measure student
perceptions of themselves and their school environment.34 The two most relevant measures for
present purposes are “emotional health,” which captures some combination of conflict resolution
and social information processing, and persistence, which could be thought of as measuring
either some social-cognitive skill (“grit”) or the tendency for youth to make a particular
judgment and decision-making error (catastrophizing) that leads them to desist after experiencing
some failure (Figure III). One limitation of these surveys is that the response rate for our sample
is low, and is slightly different for treatment versus control groups (42 versus 38 percent, p<.05).
With these limitations in mind, Table VIII shows that the effect of participation on a Zscored index of our measures of perseverance and emotional health is equal to 0.13 standard
deviations.35 While this estimate is somewhat imprecise (p=0.180), it is at least in a direction that
is consistent with changes in some underlying decision-making or non-academic skills may be
one mechanism at work here. Suggestive evidence that this estimate is not merely an artifact of
34

The 30-minute survey is designed to address a number of questions regarding school culture and climate. CCSR
has administered surveys to CPS teachers, students, and principals for two decades. In Spring 2011, surveys were
received from ~146,000 students in more than 600 schools. All students in grades 6-12 and all teachers were asked
to participate. The student web survey was administered within each school during school hours (CCSR Support
Center 2012), with each response registered on a Likert scale. CCSR used Rasch analysis on individual survey
items. We standardized these measures into standard deviation units based on the observed distribution within the
control group.
35
This index was formed in the same way as our main academic index.

30

low or differential survey response rates comes from the fact that we do not see similar positive
impacts on measures that should not be affected our intervention, such as academic press (how
challenging students find courses and teachers) and course clarity.
XII.

BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS

This section presents our attempts to measure the monetized value of the benefits and
costs of the program. The cost side is driven by tangible costs of delivering the program to
participating youth, and so is easy to measure from budget information from the program
providers – around $1,100 per participant.36 Monetizing the benefits of the program, which
includes intangible benefits such as improved quality of life from less street crime to the public,
is more complicated. We summarize the results of our attempts here, with details in Appendix F.
The results presented in Table IX suggest that the value to society from reductions in
criminal behavior during our study period, concentrated during the program year itself, may
generate benefit-cost ratios ranging from 5:1 up to 30:1. The smallest estimate ($5,309) comes
from using our lower-bound IV and lower-bound monetary valuations for homicide, which wind
up driving cost-of-crime estimates (Kling, Ludwig & Katz 2005). The upper bound ($33,262)
comes from assuming participation data are accurate and using willingness-to-pay estimates for
the costs of crime. Our standard errors understate the true uncertainty here because they ignore
the conceptual uncertainty associated with monetizing the value of reductions in crime.
Because homicide is so much more costly than all other offenses, readers might wonder
to what degree these benefit-cost figures are driven by impacts on this costly but relatively rare
outcome. If we exclude homicide from the analysis altogether, the estimate for the IV effect on
the total number of violent crimes per youth is perhaps unsurprisingly similar to our main result
36

Since program costs are most often calculated on a per-participant rather than per-random assignee basis, we use
the LATE impact estimates to calculate benefits per participant. We could equivalently use the ITT impact
estimates, but rescale the costs to be per random-assignee.

31

presented above. Our lower- and upper-bound estimates for the social benefits from reductions in
criminal behavior by youth (the top row of Table IX) now equal $2,300 and $12,150,
respectively, and are much more precisely estimated than are our estimates with homicide
included (with p-values equal to .04 and .01, respectively). Put differently, the benefit-cost ratio
is at least 2:1 just from the social-cost impacts from offenses aside from homicide.
The benefits might be much higher still if the impacts on schooling outcomes that we see
during our study period – both in the program year and follow-up year – lead to increased high
school graduation. To approximate what these benefits could be, we use a study of district-wide
longitudinal data that reports how schooling outcomes during grade 9 correlate with later
graduation rates (Allensworth & Easton 2007). We use these estimates to approximate the
change in graduation rate associated with the improvement in GPA seen in our treatment group,
then multiply those graduation rates by estimates for the benefits of increased high school
graduation. This extrapolation obviously requires strong assumptions. The magnitude is
nonetheless notable: we forecast that the changes in GPA caused by the program could translate
into increases in graduation rates between 3 and 10 percentage points, or 7 to 22 percent relative
to control complier baseline rates, which could translate into benefits to society that range from
about $38,000 per participant up to as much as $84,000.
This analysis also highlights the difference across disciplines in how to think about the
value of policy interventions. For example, the influential Blueprints for Violence Prevention
program requires an intervention to have impacts on crime that persist in order to be a “model
program.” In contrast the standard argument by economists would be that for purposes of
guiding public policy, what matters is not the persistence of an impact but rather the whether
impacts of whatever duration generate benefits larger than costs (as is the case here).

XIII.

CONCLUSION

This paper presents results from a large-scale randomized experimental study in Chicago
with economically disadvantaged male youth, which suggest that behavior for this population
may be much more elastic than previous research suggests. Participation reduces violent-crime
arrest by 8 per 100 participants (44 percent) and arrests for “other” offenses by 11.5 per 100
participants (36 percent), driven by declines in vandalism, trespassing, and weapons offenses.
These impacts occur on the types of offenses we might expect to be most strongly affected by an
intervention that places a heavy emphasis on reducing automatic, angry behavior, and common
biased beliefs like hostile attribution bias (over-attribution of malevolent intent to others). While
the crime impacts do not persist, impacts on schooling outcomes do, with gains that we estimate
could translate into higher graduation rates of 3 to 10 percentage points (7-22 percent).
While our reliance on administrative data limit our ability to empirically isolate
mechanisms of action, these impacts seem to be much larger than what we see from other
interventions that include shared ingredients like mentoring or after-school programming. We
think there is at least a suggestive case to be made here that the novel ingredient in this
intervention – CBT designed to reduce judgment and decision-making errors – may be an
important mechanism of action.
Why does this intervention have lasting effects on schooling but not crime? Logically,
there are two possibilities. One is that there are at least two latent factors affected by the
intervention, one of which matters more for schooling and the other for crime, and impacts on
the one factor persist longer than on the second. The other possibility is that there is a single
underlying factor responsible for changes in both schooling and crime, with a more extreme
threshold for violence than for school disengagement or dropout (given the former is less

33

common than the latter). We would see less persistence in crime impacts if the intervention’s
effects on this underling factor persists less for the highest-risk youth (as seems to be the case
with young children in Head Start, at least for achievement test scores; see Currie & Thomas
1995; Deming 2009), so the shape of the treatment-group distribution changes over time.
Knowing more about the causes and remedies for program “fade-out” remains an open question
for our study and for social policy more generally.
As with all randomized experiments, there is always some question about the degree to
which these impacts generalize to other samples and settings. Because our study was carried out
with large numbers of disadvantaged male youth from distressed areas of Chicago, it is closer to
an “effectiveness trial” (testing a program at scale) than an “efficacy trial” of a model (or
“hothouse”) program. The intervention we study should, in principle, lend itself to further scaleup, given that it is manualized, and given that estimated benefit-cost ratios for the large-scale
implementation we study range from 5:1 to 30:1. However, because keeping youth engaged is so
central (and so difficult), selecting the right people as providers may be particularly important.
Given the sizable impacts and benefit-cost ratios we estimate here, for a population
(disadvantaged youth) for which there is currently not a surplus of successful intervention
examples, replicating these results would seem to be a priority for future research. In that spirit
we are encouraged that a separate CBT experiment we carried out in the Cook County juvenile
temporary detention center also seems to have positive early findings on the risk of readmission
(Heller, Guryan & Ludwig 2012).
What is perhaps most surprising about these findings is the size of the gains in schooling
outcomes (which could translate into increased graduation rates of 7-22%) and observed
reductions in violent-crime arrests (44%) given the relatively limited number of one-or-two-hour

34

sessions participants attended (about 13) and the low cost of the intervention ($1,100 per
participant). The behavioral outcomes of a study sample (disadvantaged male youth) that have
been so hard to help through other interventions appear to be remarkably elastic to even fairly
modest investments in a program that includes CBT-based efforts to remediate common,
predictable judgment and decision-making errors. Yet most of the $550 billion the U.S. spends
on our most important socializing institution – our K-12 public schools (U.S. Census Bureau
2010) – is devoted to developing academic skills, at least after the first few years. Given how
little attention is currently devoted to addressing non-academic factors that affect long-term
outcomes of at-risk youth, there may be substantial returns to society from expanding
investments in this area.

35

Appendix A:
Review of previous intervention studies
We begin this appendix by reviewing what is known from previous studies about the
impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and related interventions on outcomes of youth.
We then expand the lens to studies that examine both older and younger populations. We
conclude by noting that remarkably little is known about how to improve schooling outcomes
and reduce criminal involvement among at-risk teens even when we look across the entire
intervention literature, not limited to any specific intervention strategy.
1. Previous assessments of cognitive-behavioral interventions for youth
Previous meta-analyses of targeted, low-cost approaches that fall under the general rubric
of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) claim that the available empirical evidence supports the
value of this intervention. However, our careful inspection of individual studies in this literature
suggests that claim rests mostly on findings from non-experimental studies that may confound
the effects of CBT interventions with the effects of selection of systematically different types of
youth into programming or comparison conditions. Our examination of the modest number of
previous randomized experiments that have been carried out suggests more mixed findings in
support of CBT, if these results are taken at face value. But even many of the experiments have
important methodological limitations as well, which leads us to conclude that the current studies
are not very informative about the effects of CBT on those youth outcomes of greatest policy
concern, such as high school dropout or violence involvement.
Up through the 1970s, most psychological interventions focused on helping people to
identify and process conflicts and traumas in their pasts. Traditional psychodynamic approaches
view presenting symptoms as reflecting more fundamental underlying difficulties which must be
addressed before the presenting symptoms could be genuinely relieved (Walker & Bright 2009,
p. 179). CBT is more pragmatic in its objectives. A key innovation of CBT was to recognize that
the effects of past experience on current problematic symptoms are mediated through
problematic, often automatic thoughts, and that focusing more directly on those mediating
thoughts can lead to greater short-term relief of symptoms. Compared to traditional
psychological approaches, CBT is also more directive, pursuing specific goals such as symptom
relief or behavior change, and more structured, focused on concrete problems and their solutions.
CBT is a broad label, which encompasses a family of problem-focused treatments (e.g.,
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Rational Behavior Therapy, Rational Living Therapy,
Cognitive Therapy, Dialectic Behavior Therapy) that follow similar guiding principles and seek
to address related emotional and behavioral problems. CBT includes a variety of techniques to
help individuals “identify, monitor, challenge, and change their thoughts and behaviour” (Walker
& Bright 2009, p. 179). CBT’s motivating principles include the belief that maladaptive thoughts
are key antecedents to problematic emotions and behaviors. When CBT is successful, individuals
learn more effective patterns of thinking and relating to their environments. Individuals also
learn new strategies to regulate automatic or impulsive behaviors. By helping people to think
more realistically and effectively, interventions can provide symptomatic relief while
ameliorating problematic behaviors.

36

Specific CBT intervention strategies vary, though common elements distinguish CBT
from other behavioral interventions (Walker & Bright 2009, p. 179). CBT requires patients’ or
clients’ active participation in the treatment process. Treatment providers frequently employ
individual or group exercises, role-playing, or individual storytelling to make CBT an active
collaboration between treatment providers and those seeking to benefit from treatment
intervention. In practice, CBT participants are often ambivalent regarding deeply-rooted
problematic behaviors, and are often ambivalent regarding continued participation and
engagement in the treatment itself. Motivational components are therefore especially important
for any successful intervention. CBT is also time-limited. Relatively brief interventions are
expected to produce tangible benefits. Most CBT interventions are relatively short-duration
(generally 16-24 contact hours).
CBT has been shown to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for specific
psychiatric disorders such as depression (Birmaher, et al. 2000; Brent, Holder & Kolko 1997;
Clarke, Hops & Lewinsohn 1992; Rohde, et al. 2004; Wood, Harrington & Moore 1996), anxiety
disorders (Barrett, et al. 2001; In-Albon & Schneider 2007; Kendall & Wilcox 1980; Kendall, et
al. 1990), intermittent explosive disorder (McCloskey, et al. 2008), conduct problems (Kazdin
1995; Kendall & Wilcox 1980; Kendall, et al. 1990; Koegl, et al. 2008), attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (Toplak, et al. 2008), and emotional dysregulation among severely
disordered people (Koerner & Linehan 2000; Linehan, et al. 1999). CBT has also been found to
help treat problems like chronic pain (McCracken & Turk 2002), medication adherence (Parsons,
et al. 2007), adolescent substance use problems (Waldron & Turner 2008; Waldron & Kaminer
2004), and stress management (Antoni, et al. 2000; Gaab, et al. 2003).
Growing practitioner interest has led to attempts to use CBT to change other youth
problem behaviors as well. CBT interventions have tried to reduce youth problem behavior by
helping youth to reduce automatic impulses and aggressive behavior, through for example
teaching relaxation techniques. CBT is also used in efforts to help youth broaden their
perspectives in making choices (such as helping youth better consider the consequences of their
actions for others), and measures to address specific cognitive distortions such as hostile
attribution bias (assuming others have malicious intent). Interventions may also develop and
practice specific problem-solving techniques, including techniques for conflict resolution.
Several meta-analytic reviews conclude that CBT might be a very effective (and very costeffective) way to reduce crime and delinquency among both adults and juveniles (Drake, Aos &
Miller 2009; Greenwood 2008; Landenberger & Lipsey 2005; Lipsey 2009; Lipsey & Cullen
2007). For example, Drake, Aos, and Miller (2009) conclude that “the net value of the average
evidence-based cognitive behavioral program for adult offenders is $15,361 per offender.” A
Campbell Systematic Review by Lipsey, Landenberger, and Wilson (2007) noted many
limitations of existing research, but also reach a favorable overall assessment: “Research to date
leaves little doubt that CBT is capable of producing significant reductions in the recidivism of
even high risk offenders under favorable conditions.”
Yet the empirical support for the most optimistic of these claims comes largely from nonexperimental studies that are susceptible to selection bias. Those youth or adults who select into

37

CBT programs may be systematically different from those who did not volunteer, in which case
non-experimental studies may confound the causal effects of the programs with those of hard-tomeasure individual attributes associated with program selection. While the meta-analyses use
statistical tests to gauge whether the presence of non-experimental studies might have skewed
their results, and tend to find few statistically significant correlations between specific studydesign features and effect sizes, statistical power for this sort of exercise is typically modest.
Unfortunately, randomized experiments are so rare in this area that the highly-regarded
Campbell Collaboration – which is dedicated to synthesizing rigorous empirical research and
promoting evidence-based policy – concluded “it is unrealistic to restrict systematic reviews in
[this] field to randomized experimental studies, however superior they may be, because so few
exist” (Greenwood 2008, p. 289). A discomfiting proportion of the experiments included in
meta-analyses are technical reports, chapters, or doctoral dissertations rather than published
articles in the peer-review literature. Those few experiments that are carried out also tend to
focus on small-scale model programs, rather than at-scale programs – that is, they mostly
correspond to what medical researchers call “efficacy trials” rather than large-scale
“effectiveness trials.”37 And even many of the small-scale tests have important study limitations.
2. Re-examining experimental studies of cognitive behavior interventions for youth
We performed our own careful examination of every randomized trial of a CBT
intervention, or of arguably related programs to promote social-cognitive skills or socioemotional learning. Our sample frame for identifying individual studies was to include every
experiment that was included in several particularly influential meta-analyses. To reduce the risk
of missing relevant high-quality randomized experiments, we also included any experiment
testing a CBT, social-cognitive, or social-emotional learning intervention that was considered to
be a high-quality RCT by one of several widely-used research aggregators. Specifically, we
included all studies that were either:
1. Included in the review of the entire literature on crime-prevention carried out by the
Washington State Institute for Public Policy (Aos, Miller & Drake 2006; Lee, et al.
2012)
2. Included in the review of the literature on cognitive-behavioral programs for criminal
offenders by Landenberger and Lipsey (2005)
3. Included in the review of the social and emotional learning literature by Durlak,
Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor and Schellinger (2011).
4. Was rated a “Top Tier” or “Near Top Tier” intervention by the Coalition for EvidenceBased Policy (www.coalition4evidence.org).
5. Was rated a “Level 1” intervention by FindYouthInfo.gov, which was created by the
federal government’s Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs
37

In similar fashion, Lipsey, Landenberger, and Wilson (2007) report: “Of the 58 studies that met the inclusion
criteria for this review, only 19 used random assignment designs and, of those, only 13 maintained sufficiently low
attrition from outcome measurement to yield results with high internal validity. Moreover, only six of the random
assignment studies were conducted on “real world” CBT practice; the others were research and demonstration
projects. The amount of high quality research on CBT in representative correctional practice is not yet large enough
to determine whether the impressive effects on recidivism found in this meta-analysis can be routinely attained
under everyday circumstances” (p.58).

38

6. Was rated “Effective” by CrimeSolutions.gov, sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Justice’s Office of Justice Programs
7. Was rated as a “Model Program” by the Blueprints for Violence Prevention
(www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints), a widely-cited resource established by the
University of Colorado to “identify truly outstanding violence and drug prevention
programs that meet a high scientific standard of effectiveness.”
8. Met the evidence standards of the U.S. Department of Education’s What Works
Clearinghouse (ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/). In addition, we included four other valuable
studies that met the What Works Clearinghouse standards “with reservations.”
These searches identified 27 studies that focus on youth age 13-18, which, taken at face
value, suggest mixed results. Twelve of the 27 studies find beneficial, statistically significant
effects; 15 of the 27 find no statistically significant results. Close inspection of the 27 studies
suggest that this pattern of mixed results may be less informative than it first appears. Many of
the cited studies display important limitations that limit internal or external validity.
Fifteen of the 27 studies displayed faulty randomization, as suggested by either the
description of how the authors tried to carry out random assignment, or by evidence of imbalance
in baseline characteristics for the “randomized” treatment and control groups. An additional
seven exhibited attrition rates of at least 20 percent, or marked differences in the study attrition
rates between treatment and control groups. Nine of the 27 studies rely upon self-reported
outcomes. We know from prior studies that student self-reports regarding crime and other
stigmatized behaviors are susceptible to widespread under-reporting (Kling, Ludwig & Katz
2005). Systematic differences between treatment and control groups in under-reporting of antisocial behaviors is a particular problem for any intervention that develops relationships between
program providers and participants, since the latter may then wish to avoid disappointing the
former by not confessing to undesirable behaviors (that is, program participation may affect the
degree of self-presentation bias on self-reported survey responses).
Sample size (and thus limited statistical power) is also a substantial issue. Seven of the
twelve successfully randomized studies involved fewer than 100 individuals in the treatment
group. (Three of these seven involved treatment groups of less than fifty.) Small sample sizes are
often adequate when exploring common outcomes. Larger samples are required when one
explores relative rare outcomes such as violent offending. Even when sample sizes are slightly
larger, some important studies yield suggestive findings that fail to reach statistical significance
due to low power.
Fourteen of the 27 studies concern youth in specialized juvenile justice or mental health
settings. These studies are thus less pertinent to understanding the degree to which this sort of
intervention approach can improve youth outcomes at large scale when delivered in community
settings, such as through the public schools as in the program we study here. Fully 21 of the 27
studies experienced limitations to randomization, attrition difficulties, or relied on self-reported
outcomes. Out of the remaining six studies, only two (Armstrong 2003; Dynarski, et al. 1998)
included treatment groups exceeding 100 individuals.

39

Dynarski et al. (1998) avoided many threats to internal validity common in this research
literature. These authors analyzed an RCT of the “Twelve Together” peer support and mentoring
program for middle- and high-school students in Chula Vista, California (WWC Intervention
Report 2007). Like the current intervention, Twelve Together included weekly peer discussion
groups involving roughly twelve participants and an adult facilitator, the latter often a college
student. The program also included homework assistance, college trips, and an annual weekend
retreat. The trial met WWC evidence standards “with reservations,” because treatment-control
difference in survey response rates (92% vs. 86%, respectively) exceeded the five percentagepoint differential attrition threshold used in WWC reviews of school dropout.
At the end of three-year follow-up, Dynarski and colleagues found that 8% of the
treatment group had dropped out of school, versus 13% of controls. Yet the implied effect size of
0.33SD failed to reach statistical significance given the constraints on statistical power in the
study – the sample subject to random assignment was just 219. These authors also found no
statistically significant benefits in other domains, such as highest grades completed, days absent,
dropout, or school disciplinary problems (Dynarski, et al. 1998).
Armstrong (2003) was identified as a high-quality study by the careful literature review
carried out by Aos, Miller, and Drake (2006). This study provides a clinical trial of Moral
Reconation Therapy (RCT). This experiment randomly assigned a total of 256 juveniles within a
Maryland detention center to treatment (N=135) or a control group (N=121). The main results in
the paper come from analyzing a sample that excludes the N=19 youth assigned to the treatment
group who did not actually receive the treatment because they refused, or could not speak
English, or were released from the facility, as well as the N=25 control group youth who wound
up receiving the program, and so does not fully represent what one might think of as “bestpractice” for analyzing data from a randomized experiment.
Armstrong reports that the experiment also carried out a more standard intention-to-treat
(ITT) analysis and the “results of the two sets of analyses were not different” (p. 676), but the
ITT point estimates and confidence intervals are not presented in the paper itself. Overall
recidivism rates are not different between treatment and control groups; in terms of the number
of days to re-arrest, the treatment group has a higher mean (307 vs. 295) and median (258 vs.
228). Given the total number of juveniles assigned to the treatment and control groups in this
study, we have some concern about whether the study has statistical power to detect effects large
enough to be meaningful from the perspective of a benefit-cost analysis. Moreover, there may
have been a problem with randomization: the proportion of youth who are African-American
was much higher in the treatment vs. control group (67% versus 48%).38

38

Two additional studies are worth mention for the programs’ similarities to BAM. The ALAS (Spanish for
“wings”) intervention, despite its small sample size, bears clear similarities in structure and curricular content to
those of the BAM Sports Edition intervention. Although the study involved a treatment group of only 46 students,
treatment and control groups were successfully randomized, with low attrition and administrative data to avoid
common pitfalls of student self-reports.
ALAS served students identified to be at-risk due to academic or behavioral difficulties. Each participant
was assigned a counselor, who monitored the student’s progress, communicated with parents and teachers, and
ensured that ALAS services were delivered. The ALAS program includes intensive attendance monitoring, ten
weeks of instruction on problem-solving skills using the ALAS Resilience Builder curriculum (WWS 2006).

40

Only two of the secondary prevention trials identified statistically significant outcome
differences between treatment and control groups. Each of these studies displayed at least one
significant study limitation.39 Only two trials included youth over the age of fifteen, thus
excluding the peak years of youth criminal offending.

Teachers provided regular feedback to students through program mentors. Families also received training in parentchild problem-solving and related subjects.
Larson and Rumberger (1995) analyzed a sample of 94 students in the Los Angeles Unified School District.
These students had participated in ALAS since the beginning of 7th grade, and were first evaluated at the end of 9th
grade, and again evaluated at the end of 11th grade. These authors found statistically significant improvements in
two important measures: Student school enrollment at the end of 9th grade (98% within the ALAS group vs. 83%
among controls), and being “on track” to graduate at that same point (72% vs. 53%). Differences in enrollment and
on-track status at the end of 11th grade continued to favor the treatment group (75% vs. 67%, and 33% vs. 26%,
respectively). However these notable differences were no longer statistically significant given the small sample.
39
The Farrell, Meyer, and White (2001) analysis of the Responding in Peaceful and Positive Ways (RIPP)
intervention deserves mention given its similarities to the BAM intervention studied in this paper. Randomized at
the classroom level, this study employed administrative records to examine one-year follow-up of students’ violent
behavior in middle school. Within a mixed pattern of findings, these authors found significantly lower rates of inschool suspensions among male RIPP participants. As with other studies, the RIPP evaluation appears to have
experienced high non-random attrition rates. Moreover, attrited students were older, had lower grade point averages,
lower attendance, and more out of school suspensions than did students who remained in the study.
Farrell, Meyer, Sullivan, and Kung (2003) performed a similar trial, relying on students’ self-reported data
of recent violent behavior. These authors found statistically significant differences in outcome between treatment
and control groups. However, these results may have been influenced by high attrition rates. On average, attrited
students were older, had lower grade point averages (though the difference was not significant), and were less likely
to come from two-parent households than other participants.
Orpinas et al. (2000) performed a large intervention trial, randomized at the school level, which sought to
reduce middle-school students’ aggressive behavior as defined by the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. The study relied
upon self-reported outcomes, with no demonstration of treatment-control balance at baseline. Participants displayed
a 21.5% attrition rate, with more aggressive students more likely to exist the study sample.
Patton et al. (2006) performed a school-randomized trial in which self-reported anti-social behaviors among
8th graders were compared within 12 treatment and 14 control schools. Sample schools were not shown to be
balanced at baseline. Six schools dropped out after being selected and were not included in analysis; one school
stopped participating during intervention and was excluded from final analysis. The cross-sectional study design
precluded analysis of how particular individuals responded to treatment. Finally, between 19 and 34% of students
were not surveyed in the evaluation.
Skye (2001) performed an innovative classroom-randomized trial for high school students. This
intervention sought to reduce risk of violence as measured by student self-reports on the Eruptive Violence scale.
Treatment and control groups were not balanced at baseline. Moreover, reliance on student self-reports, limited
statistical power, and unreported attrition rates provide important limitations.
Harrington, et al. (2001) analysis of the “All Stars” character development program provided another
informative school-randomized trial of interventions for middle-school students. These authors examined students’
self-reported violence towards other persons within matched pairs of treatment and control schools based on
demographics and the receipt of free/reduced lunch. This study’s reliance on self-report outcome data and its high
sample attrition (27.7%) again provide important limitations.
A Norwegian study by Gundersen and collaborators (2006) provide another pertinent analysis of
Aggression Replacement Training. Small sample size—the control group was only eighteen subjects--and
compromised randomization hinder interpretation of study results.
Finally, Simons-Morton and colleagues (2005) examined the effectiveness of the multi-faceted “Going
Places” intervention, which was designed to address a broad array of adolescent problem behaviors. Seven middle
schools were randomized to intervention or comparison conditions and students in two successive cohorts (n =
1484) of students. The study relied on student self-reports. It was also hindered by 37 percent attrition rate.

3. CBT interventions with adults
Expanding our lens to also include CBT experiments with adults, not just teens, does not
greatly change the picture about what we can learn from existing research about the effects of
CBT or related interventions on behavioral outcomes of key policy concern.
Consider, for example, the two CBT experiments with adults that the literature review by
Aos and colleagues (2006) think are of the highest quality: both still have important limitations.
Van Voorhis et al. (2004) assess the effects of Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&R) provided to
468 randomly assigned adult parolees in Georgia, with an average age of 30 and generally fairly
extensive prior records. (Because their paper provides an excellent critical review of previous
studies of R&R, we do not replicate that literature review here). The treatment group typically
has lower rates of adverse follow-up outcomes, approximately 8-10% of the control mean, for
outcomes such as 9 month re-arrest rates (38% vs. 42%) and 30-month prison re-admission rates
(43% vs. 47%).
While these treatment-control differences are not statistically significant, this could be due
to limited statistical power. A total of 243 parolees were assigned to the treatment. Sixty percent
of those assigned to treatment completed the program. Outcomes through 30 months were
available for only around two-thirds of the sample. The resulting confidence intervals on
program effectiveness were rather wide. Within the preferred logistic regression, the 95%
confidence interval on the odds ratio for rearrest/parole revocation ranged from 0.62 to 1.17. In
similar fashion, the 95% confidence interval on the odds ratio for returning to prison ranged from
0.67 to 1.17. Such limited statistical power is quite worrisome in a policy sense. A decline in
criminal offending of 8-10% – if real – would (given the costs of crime; see Ludwig 2006) be
ample for the intervention to pass a benefit-cost test (Drake, Aos & Miller 2009).
Aos and colleagues identify one other randomized experiment for adults, Ortmann (2000),
that they considered to be of highest quality. This study reports treatment-control differences in
recidivism equal to roughly 8-10% of the control mean, but which are not statistically significant.
The Ortmann study has even less statistical power than that of Van Voorhis et al., having
enrolled a total of just 111 prisoners (in Germany) in the treatment group.
4. Related interventions among children
Previous research shows that early childhood interventions such as Perry Preschool,
Abecedarian, Head Start, and Nurse/Family Partnership, which provide a mix of academic
support, parenting training, and other social services between the pre-natal period and age 5,
have long-term effects on educational attainment, employment and earnings, and in some cases,
crime--despite fade-out of impacts on IQ or achievement test scores (Campbell, et al. 2002;
Currie & Thomas 1995; Deming 2009; Garces, Thomas & Currie 2002; Lochner 2011; Ludwig
& Miller 2007; Olds, et al. 1999; Schweinhart, et al. 2005). Through process of elimination,
researchers have inferred that effects on non-academic factors must be the key mediating
mechanism for the long-term effects of these interventions. Indirect proxies for “non-cognitive
skills” such as teacher-reported behavior and mood are interpreted as support for this hypothesis

42

(Heckman, et al. 2010). Yet few studies include good direct measures of these skills; these nonacademic factors essentially play the role of social policy dark matter.
A few randomized experiments have tried to change non-academic factors among
elementary school children as well. The Fast Track intervention worked with children starting in
grade 1 and lasting through high school (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group 2011).
Children in elementary school (grades 1-5) were provided with weekly sessions to enhance
social-cognitive skills; the program also provided tutoring to children, parent-training groups,
and home visits to work on parenting practices. Intensity of the intervention was reduced
somewhat during middle and high school. Follow-up studies found the program during
elementary school did indeed strengthen social-cognitive skills, developmentally appropriate
parenting practices, and child behavior. However, by high school, the intervention no longer had
a statistically significant impact on the full study sample; there were signs of impacts on the
highest-risk sub-group, but only on outcomes measured by parent report, not child self-report.
An intervention by Hudley and Graham (1993) focused on addressing “hostile intention
attribution bias” (a social information processing problem in which people have the tendency to
assume malevolent intent by others) by randomizing a sample of 72 African-American
elementary school boys (ages 10-12) screened for problems with aggression. Boys were
randomized to an intervention that addressed hostile attribution bias, a different program not
focused on addressing hostile attribution bias, included to identify any generic programparticipation effect, and a control group. At four-month follow up, the study found some impact
of the intervention on how boys interpreted the intention of others in study scenarios, some
impact on teacher reports of aggression, and no detectable impacts on disciplinary referrals to the
office at school.
5. Interventions to reduce dropout and delinquency / youth violence more generally
It is always possible that our review of the literature might have missed some key studies,
or that we are being too negative about the quality of evidence in this area. Some support for our
critical interpretation arises from the fact that so few intervention strategies to remediate socialcognitive skill deficits meet criteria for top-tier evidence-based programs by organizations
specifically devoted to critically assessing existing research evidence. For example, the U.S.
Department of Education’s What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) does not give a single dropoutprevention program its top rating of “strong effects” (defined as several randomized experiments
or quasi-experiments all pointing in the same direction, or one large randomized experiment).
The Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy does not list a single program for addressing high
school graduation rates among its “Top Tier” of programs.
Our understanding of how to reduce youth violence is little better. The influential
Blueprints for Violence Prevention reviewed over 900 studies; the total number of “model
programs” found to reduce criminal involvement among teens was just four. Three of these
model programs work with youth already in the criminal justice system and are relatively costly
(Multi-Systemic Therapy, which costs $4,500 per participant, Multi-Dimensional Treatment
Foster Care, $27,300 per youth, and Family Functional Therapy, FFT, which cost $1,600-$5,000
per youth) – and so may not be scalable. And the empirical evidence is somewhat less

43

compelling than one might have imagined given their designations as “model programs” for two
of these four model programs: FFT and Big Brothers / Big Sisters (BB/BS).40

40

While a meta-analysis suggests that FFT is a cost-effective crime-reduction strategy (Drake, Aos & Miller 2009),
some of the relevant studies did not involve random assignment (Barnoski & Aos 2004; Barton, et al. 1985; Gordon,
Graves & Arbuthnot 1995) and others use sample sizes under 100 (Alexander & Parsons 1973; Klein, Alexander &
Parsons 1977). The largest randomized study (917 families) found no differences overall between treatment and
control youth; reduced recidivism only occurred for the treatment youth who happened to receive high-fidelity
versions of the program (Sexton & Turner 2010). Yet youth were not randomly assigned to the high-fidelity group,
so we cannot be certain their reduced recidivism was due to the program (particularly given that this group had
significantly different criminal histories at baseline). The study of BB/BS relies on youth self-reports to measure
outcomes, and so may confound program effects on behavior with effects on self-reporting bias if program youth are
worried about disappointing their mentors (Spelman 1994).

44

Appendix B:
Selection of study schools and students
Our team originally recruited 16 CPS schools to participate in the study. Four of those
schools run separate achievement academies within the same building. These are large and
distinct schools for students facing academic or social barriers to conventional academic
advancement. Since these achievement academies ran distinct treatment groups and we
randomized them separately, we treat them as separate schools – and so essentially began the
study with 20 schools total. The program was never actually implemented in one school, and one
school was excluded for problems with randomization. (We did not have a full set of baseline
characteristics available at the time we had to carry out randomization in this school, and so
randomized 83 youth to treatment and control without being able to construct the risk index
described below. Ex post analysis indicated there were statistically significant imbalances
between the treatment and control groups on baseline characteristics). Our main sample therefore
consists of 18 schools.
Five of these schools are elementary schools, which in Chicago serve students in grades
K-8, while 13 are high schools serving grades 9-12. Sample schools were among the lowestperforming in CPS; seven have average GPAs of 2.25 or below (Roderick, Nagaoka &
Allensworth 2006). Three are currently “turnaround” schools, chosen for major reform due to
consistently low student performance.
To construct our study sample frame, CPS provided us with administrative data on all
male students they expected to attend the study schools and be enrolled in grades 7-10 during the
2009-10 academic year (AY), a total of 3,669 students. We focused on males because of their
very disproportionate involvement in serious inter-personal violence in Chicago (as in every
other U.S. city). Based on discussions with the non-profit organizations running the intervention,
prior to randomization we excluded some students according to their baseline (AY 2008-9)
characteristics:41
1. Youth who seem to have stopped going to school, and so were unlikely to attend
school frequently enough to benefit from a school-based program. A total of 268
students (about 5 percent of our initial sample frame) were excluded because they
missed more than 60 percent of days during AY 2008-9 and received a grade of “F”
in at least 75 percent of their courses.
2. Students with specific Individualized Education Program (IEP) designations for
serious discrete conditions including autism, emotional and behavioral disorders,
speech and language disabilities, “educatable mentally handicapped,” traumatic
brain injury, and diagnosed emotional and behavioral disorders. Service providers
41

Staff of the non-profit organization that ran the intervention determined after the initial randomization that they
could not effectively serve youth who were significantly older than grade level—which staff operationalized as all
youth born before October 1, 1992. A total of 153 youth were therefore “never takers” because the provider decided
not to offer them treatment, although were still kept in the study sample to preserve randomization. At some
locations, this resulted in suboptimal sample sizes for the number of youth receiving treatment. A total of 152 ageeligible control youths from 10 schools were then selected at random to replace these age-ineligible youth, though
we treat them as controls for the analysis to maintain the original randomization.

45

determined that youth with these specific diagnoses were unlikely to benefit from
the BAM curriculum. A total of 294 youth (just over 5 percent) were excluded for
this reason. Less intensive IEP designations were not used as a study exclusion
criterion. Indeed, roughly 20 percent of our final study sample had some sort of IEP
designation, most commonly for the general category of learning disability.
We then ranked all the remaining students in our target CPS schools on the basis of a risk
index, which was a single-factor composite of whether a student was at least one year older than
his assigned grade level, the number of classes for which a student had received a grade of “F”
during AY 2008-9, the number of unexcused absences during AY 2008-9, and the number of inschool suspensions during AY 2008-9. A large number of students were missing academic
achievement test scores for AY 2008-9, due to some combination of CPS testing schedules (not
all grades are subject to standardized testing each year) and student absences during testing days.
Due to the large number of missing items for this variable, test scores were not used selecting the
study sample.
We then calculated the number of students needed in each school for the study sample
(treatment and control), selected that many students in descending order on our risk index, and
randomized those selected students to one of four conditions (in-school only, after-school only,
both, or neither) within school (a block-randomized design with schools as blocks).

46

Appendix C:
Additional details on administrative data sources
In this section, we discuss in more detail the administrative data sources we use to
measure outcomes in both domains.
Our main schooling outcomes come from longitudinal student-level records obtained
from CPS for the program year (AY 2009-10) and follow-up year (AY 2010-11), with controls in
our regression for student outcomes during the pre-program year (AY 2008-9). Because our
original sampling frame was drawn from CPS data, we could use students’ CPS identification
numbers to directly access their data rather than using probabilistic matching. We used these data
to form a summary index of schooling outcomes, equal to an (unweighted) average of days
present, GPA, and persistence in school (enrollment status at the end of the 2009-10 academic
year42), each normalized to Z-score form using the control group’s distribution. Our index of
schooling outcomes does not include standardized test scores. CPS by design does not administer
standardized tests to all grades (particularly older grades). Thus, more than half of all students in
our study sample are missing test scores (similar shares for treatment and control groups). Our
index also does not include administrative records on school disciplinary actions; we have heard
conflicting accounts from multiple sources familiar with CPS records about whether disciplinary
actions are inconsistently reported and recorded.43
To measure criminal behavior by program participants, we use electronic arrest records
(or “rap sheets”) from Illinois State Police (ISP), obtained through the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority (ICJIA) for research purposes. The ISP maintains a database of Illinois
arrests, collected from local police departments which are required by law to report all juvenile
felony arrests, and optionally class A and B misdemeanors. Some local police departments also
voluntarily submit information that is not subject to mandatory reporting requirements. Police
departments in Illinois use biometric (fingerprint) identification systems at the time of arrest.
This means that even if a youth lies about his identity when arrested, as long as his fingerprint is
on record and he has ever reported his actual name and date of birth at any point for any of his
arrests, then an arrest in which he misreports his individual identifying information will still
show up in our data attached to the correct state identification number.
The ISP arrest records are intended to capture arrests of people below the age of majority
within the criminal justice system (juvenile arrests), as well as to those who are above the age of
majority (age 17 and above for those charged with a felony; starting in 2010, 17-year-olds
charged with a misdemeanor offense are considered to be a juvenile). Over the course of the
2000s, the ISP data system’s coverage of juvenile arrests reportedly improved a great deal. A
comparison of “age-crime curves” (arrest rates by age) for Chicago youth compared to urban
42

We operationalize end-of-year enrollment as either having at least one grade on record for the second semester of
the year, or as being marked as transferring to a non-CPS school. We could alternatively use official CPS enrollment
status, which although subject to incentives to misreport, does not appreciably change the results.
43
Using data on all students who were present for at least half a day in CPS (thus having a chance to commit a
disciplinary infraction), three of four disciplinary measures have negative point estimates (total number of
infractions, number of serious infractions, and number of out of school suspensions) ranging from -0.01 to -0.04
standard deviations; in-school suspension has a positive point estimate of 0.03. None of these effects is statistically
significant.

47

youth in other cities where the age of majority is different suggests no unusually large “jump” in
arrest rates for Chicago youth at the age at which teenage arrestees are automatically sent to the
adult justice system (Kling, Ludwig & Katz 2005).
ICJIA used a probabilistic-matching software (Merge Tool Box) to match the list of study
names and dates of birth to their Criminal History Record Information database. Soundex
algorithms were used to help match first and last names across error-prone administrative
databases. We use the arrest histories for any individual with a match quality score above
32.29501, or whose identifying information matched on at least 4 of the 5 available fields (first
name, last name, day of birth, month of birth, and year of birth). Results using a lower quality
threshold (31.63083) that incorporate another 167 matches are less precise but qualitatively
similar (see Table A2).
Because previous studies often find more pronounced impacts of policy interventions on
violent crimes (particularly impulsive crimes such as assault) than on other crimes (Deming
2011; Evans & Owens 2007; Kling, Ludwig & Katz 2005; Lochner & Moretti 2004; Weiner,
Lutz & Ludwig 2009)) and because associated social harms are so varied across crime types, we
examine arrests separately for different offense categories. For each arrest incident, we select the
most severe charge associated with the incident. In most cases this is a charge recorded at the
time of arrest, although occasionally the State’s Attorney files a charge more severe than those
originally recorded at the police station. We classify crimes as violent, property, drug, and other,
as follows:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Violent crimes include murder, rape, assault, robbery, threats/harassment, and
kidnapping.
Property crimes include larceny, burglary, and auto theft.
Drug crimes include possession or dealing charges.
Other crimes include trespassing, fencing, bribery, animal cruelty, weapons
violations, DUIs, disobeying or avoiding law enforcement officers, disorderly
conduct, arson, prostitution, criminal neglect, parole violations, underage or
public drinking, vandalism, and miscellaneous offenses.

We exclude motor vehicle crimes, including driving with a suspended license, reckless
driving, and other driving/traffic related offenses, from our analysis. These are rare in our data
(due largely to the ages of those in our sample and presumably also to the lack of cars among so
many of the low-income families from which these youth come).

48

Appendix D:
Methods for addressing missing outcome data in CPS schooling records
While the proportion of treatment and control youth missing data during the postrandomization years is statistically indistinguishable,44 the amount of missing data increases over
the course of the post-program period. Because we selected students using AY 2008-9 CPS data,
there is basically no missing data for that pre-program year. By construction, no one has missing
values on our measure of school persistence for any of the post-randomization years, and so all
observations have at least one non-missing element of our outcome index. For the program year
itself (AY 2009-10), 274 out of 2,740 students are missing GPA information (10 percent); 80 of
those 274 are also missing attendance information. In the post-program year (AY 2010-11), we
are missing GPA information for 903 of 2,740 students (33 percent); of that group, we are
missing data on days present as well as GPA for 431 students. 45
The results presented in our main tables assume that data are missing completely at
random (MCAR), that is, the likelihood of missingness is unrelated to both observable and
unobservable attributes of youth, including potential outcomes. Our main results use the
approach from Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007) that assigns the group average (treatment or
control) to missing values on those elements of the index, which is equivalent to averaging the
effects of running separate regressions on each element of the outcome index using just those
observations with non-missing observations on the index, but with added power.
In Table V of the main text, we show the results of a lower-power MCAR approach:
limiting the regression to complete cases (listwise deletion), which throws away information for
cases that have only some missing data. We also re-calculate our estimates using different
imputation approaches that relax the MCAR assumption and rely instead on the assumption that
missingness is missing at random (MAR) – that is, for reasons that may be related to observable
youth characteristics but not to unobservables. We first use inverse probability weighting (IPW)
to weight the complete-case sample so that the distribution of baseline characteristics in that
sample matches the distribution of baseline characteristics in the full sample. To calculate these
weights, we regress an indicator for having complete data on a parsimonious set of baseline
covariates (specifically, GPA, being over age 17, and dummy variables for being black or having
been arrested). We then use the inverse of that predicted probability as a weight in our outcome
regressions, which include all baseline covariates. As long as this prediction equation is correctly
specified, the IPW approach provides consistent estimates of the treatment effect under MAR.
It is worth noting that, as is often the case with IPW (see, e.g., discussions in Cox 1991;
Puma, et al. 2009), specifying the prediction equation involves a tradeoff between bias and
44

When we regress an indicator for whether or not the student has missing data against an indicator for treatment
assignment, controlling for school fixed effects, the coefficient on treatment assignment for missing data in the
program year (AY 2009-10) equals β=0.011 (standard error 0.12), p=0.349, and for the post-program year of AY
2010-11, equals β=0.009 (0.018), p=0.608.
45
Our CPS data include some information about the why students stop showing up in the CPS data system in the
form of “leave codes,” which are intended to capture the reason why a student left the district. Yet the reliability of
these type of leave codes is open to question in administrative schooling data given schools’ possible incentives to
strategically misreport. In most districts, schools receive funds based on fall enrollments and are held accountable
for the share of students who are officially counted as dropping out.

49

variance. When we use too many additional baseline covariates that appear to be related to the
probability of missingness, observations with very low predicted-response probabilities get
implausibly large and unstable weights. This makes both the point estimate and the standard
errors sensitive to the choice of variables in the prediction equation. While it seems likely that
the prediction equation we use here does not fully satisfy MAR (that is, both observed and
unobserved characteristics that affect missingness are not included in the prediction equation),
we exchange this problem for increased stability, turning to other imputation approaches to
ensure that our results are robust.
One simple imputation approach we use is to assign zeros for attendance and grades for
students who are recorded as not being enrolled in the CPS system at the end of the academic
year – what Puma et al. (2009) call “logical imputation” (or “deductive imputation”). A
drawback of this very simple logical-imputation approach is that some youth who are not
enrolled in the CPS system at the end of the academic year will not have dropped out (for
example, they may have transferred to a private school in Chicago, or to a suburban public
school, or to a Chicago public school that did not record their new enrollment), and so their
attendance and grade information is truly missing rather than zero. A slightly more sophisticated
logical imputation approach is to make use of the “leave codes” in the CPS data that record
information about the reasons why students are no longer in the system. One potential drawback
to these records is they themselves may not be perfectly accurate, in part because schools may
have incentives to over-state enrollment figures and under-state dropouts.
A third imputation approach we employ is multiple imputation (MI), which incorporates
all the uncertainty involved in making imputations. MI uses a Bayesian approach, drawing from
the conditional predictive distribution of the missing variable(s) to impute values of the missing
data, and iterating the process to analyze m of these simulated data sets (Little & Rubin 2002;
Puma, et al. 2009). To see the intuition, let us first consider the uncertainty involved in a single
imputation. Imagine that we impute missing values by regressing each of the variables (for
observations that are non-missing) against all the other variables, then using the predicted value
from those regression parameters as the imputation for missing observations. This prediction
would lie exactly on the regression line and so would overstate our certainty about its value. To
adjust for this uncertainty, we could also add to the predicted value a randomly selected residual
from the regression, so that the variation in the imputed values is the same as with the observed
values. But there is the additional uncertainty involved with the imputation; if we repeated this
process, we would get a somewhat different imputed data set. To account for the uncertainty
associated with using imputed values, this imputation procedure is repeated numerous times, and
separate impact estimates are calculated using each dataset created by the multiple iterations. The
average of the estimates for the desired statistic is the MI estimate, and the standard error
accounts for both within- and between-imputation variances.
There is, however, once source of uncertainty remaining: we have used a regression to
predict the missing data, but the coefficients in that regression are estimates, not true parameters.
MI takes a Bayesian approach to incorporating this uncertainty. Using some starting value for the
parameters of the imputation regression (the betas and sigma-squared), we predict one set of
missing data to form a complete imputed data set as just described. We then calculate new
estimates of the betas and sigma-squared by re-running the regression on the imputed data, after

50

which we update the distribution of both parameters using these new parameter estimates. Next
we make new draws of the betas and sigma-squared from the updated distributions, re-run the
prediction regression, and so forth. MI iterates this process, forming a usable imputed data set
after some set number of iterations, then repeating the process to form the m simulated data sets.
Under MAR, MI provides consistent estimates that both make use of all the data to predict
missing values and incorporate the uncertainty involved in the imputation.
We present results using MI with m = 10 imputed data sets. We run separate imputations
for the treatment and control groups for missing GPA and attendance information, then
recalculate the academic engagement index within each data set and re-run our regressions.46
Imputing outcomes separately for treatment and control groups avoids injecting correlation with
the treatment indicator into the imputation (Puma, et al. 2009). There is also evidence that the
baseline characteristics predict missingness differently for the treatment and control groups, at
least in the follow-up year. We cannot reject the null that the relationship between baseline
characteristics and missingness is the same across treatment status during the program year
(regressing a missing indicator on baseline characteristics and the interaction of those covariates
with treatment results in a joint F-test on the treatment interactions of 1.24, p=0.1585). However,
the interaction of baseline characteristics with treatment status does seem to matter during the
follow-up year (F(=1.55, p=0.0225)). Since baseline characteristics may have differing effects on
missingness by group, it is sensible to allow their effects on the imputed values to vary by group
as well. These estimates account for both within- and between- imputation variances. We show
in Table IV that the results from MI are similar to those using the Kling, Liebman and Katz
approach, so we present the latter in our main tables for simplicity.
It is also possible that the data are missing for reasons related to unobservable as well as
observable youth attributes – that is, the data are not missing at random (NMAR). Given this
possibility, we also present bounds that use Lee’s trimming approach (2009). The intuition is that
although we cannot identify which specific treatment-group youth are observed in the dataset
only because of treatment (e.g., are selected into the sample), we can assume the highest or
lowest observed values of the outcomes belong to the group selected into the observed-data
sample because of treatment assignment, exclude those values, and calculate the treatmentcontrol difference in each case.
Specifically, suppose that a certain proportion (p) of the treatment group is selected into
the sample because of treatment but would have missing outcome data if assigned to the control
condition. The mean treatment outcome we actually observe is a weighted average of this group
and those 1-p treatment youth who would always be observed regardless of random assignment.
To be comparable to the unselected control group, we would like to remove these p selected
treatment observations. But we do not observe which p members of the treatment group are
selected into the sample. We can, however, create worst-case scenarios where the highest (or
lowest) p values of the outcome variable in the treatment group belong to these sample-selected
cases. Trimming off the highest (lowest) pth quantile of outcome values (call them Y) creates a
lower (upper) bound for the true value of the non-sample-selected cases, because the mean Y for
any possible subset of the treatment group of size 1-p can not be smaller (larger) than the mean Y
46

Specifically, we use chained predictive mean matching for days present and GPA since both are truncated
continuous variables (neither can be less than zero).

51

of the smallest 1-p values. Provided that treatment assignment only influences sample selection
in one direction – the monotonicity assumption – this procedure provides one way to bound the
treatment effect under a fairly extreme sample selection mechanism. The monotonicity
assumption underlies every selection model that is based on a latent-variable threshold for
participation (Lee 2009), and means treatment can only encourage or discourage selection into
sample, but not both.
The Lee bounds make fairly extreme assumptions about the nature of the data
missingness process. For example the lower bound is created based on the extreme assumption
that academic outcomes are perfectly negatively correlated with the latent propensity to remain
in the sample (see Lee 2009 for discussion). Since some proportion of the unobserved students
transferred to another school rather than dropped out (the noisy CPS leave codes suggest about
half), this assumption is quite extreme. There are also reasons to question the method’s
monotonicity assumption in this case – namely that a higher fraction of treatment youth are in the
sample overall and in most of our schools, but not in every school we study. Overall, we observe
a higher proportion of treatment than control youth in our CPS outcome data, suggesting
treatment encourages selection into the sample. However, if we break down the sample by
school, it is not clear that the selection mechanism consistently works this way. In the program
year, four of the 18 schools have higher proportions of control youth observed, and three have no
difference between treatment and controls. In the follow-up year, fully half of the schools have
more observed control than treatment youth, while the other one-half have more treatment youth.
The fact that treatment assignment has no consistent relationship with sample selection across all
of our schools might diminish the concern that treatment status is systematically correlated with
the missingness mechanism (as well as call into question the monotonicity assumption
underlying the Lee approach).

52

Appendix E:
Methods and results for testing for treatment-effect heterogeneity across schools
In a regression that interacts all school dummies with a treatment indicator, we cannot
reject the null that the treatment effects at each school are equal (for the program-year academic
ITT with covariates, F = 0.56, p = 0.9238; for the violent crime arrests with covariates, F = 1.18,
p = 0.2708).
Non-economists tend to prefer to perform this test using hierarchical linear modeling, a
form of a random coefficients model, in part for the efficiency gain that comes with precisionweighting the blocks (schools). In this case, the model would be:
(6) Yis  0  1 (Z is  Z i. )  ris
where
0s   00  u0s
1s   10  u1s
and where Yis is the outcome variable during the program year, Zis  Zi. is a school-demeaned
(group-centered) treatment indicator from the baseline year, and ris is the error term.47 For
simplicity we do not include covariates, and we let each school have a random intercept and
treatment effect.
This empirical strategy produces very similar substantive results as OLS, with the ITT
treatment effect on the program year academic composite equal to 0.058 (p = .04) and equal to
0.075 (p = 0.01) for the follow-up year academic composite. Using an over-dispersed Poisson
model for violent crime, we find an ITT effect of -0.217 (p = 0.08) for violent crime arrests,
very similar to the QMLE Poisson estimate of -0.201 reported in the main text. But here we can
directly test whether the variance of the slopes – i.e., the treatment effect’s variance – across
schools is zero.
We find that the treatment effect’s variance is quite small: 0.00005 for the program year
academic treatment effect, 0.0002 for the follow-up year academic treatment effect, and 0.0003
for the violent crime arrest effect. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the variance of each
of the treatment effects is zero. For the violent crime arrests, the chi-square test for whether the
variance of treatment effects across schools is zero equals 11.62 (p > 0.5). The result is similar
for the academic index (chi-square = 9.59, p>0.5 for the program year and chi-square = 6.50,
p>0.5 for the follow-up year).
Given that there are only 18 schools in the sample, this should not be interpreted as
strong evidence for constant treatment effects; our power to detect differential effects is limited,
and our schools are more similar to each other than schools in other cities may be to our sample.
The results do mean, however, that the school-level differences in observed treatment effects
were not large enough to statistically differentiate.
47

Demeaning the independent variables provides the same adjustment for blocking to the covariates as including
school fixed effects.

Appendix F.
Benefit-Cost Estimates
We calculate the benefits of the program in four parts: the benefits from the realized
crime reduction during the program year (both direct savings to the criminal justice system and
the broader social savings) and the benefits from the predicted increase in graduation based on
achievement increases (benefits to the government from increased revenues and decreased social
service use, as well as earnings benefits to the participant).
We know of no national estimates for the cost to the criminal justice system from
processing an average arrest, which includes police processing as well as the costs of later stages
of prosecution for some subset of arrested youth (detention, incarceration, probation, etc.). We
construct these estimates ourselves from a range of sources, using Chicago-specific data on
average costs and the probability of incurring each cost when possible, and relying on other
city’s estimates (mostly New York City) when Chicago data are unavailable (Hughes &
Bostwick 2011; Illinois Juvenile Justice Comission 2011; New York City Independent Budget
Office 2008). We find that the cost of an average arrest to the criminal justice system is between
$5,770 and $6,524. This is likely a conservative estimate due to the exclusion of court and
policing costs; a similar calculation for North Carolina found each arrest costs an average of
$7,300 (Governor's Crime Comission 2009). The main LATE estimate of the treatment effect for
total number of arrests is -0.1865 (p=0.087). This implies the program saved 18.65 percent of the
cost of one arrest per participant, or between $1,076 and $1,217 in direct criminal justice costs.
While these costs are important, especially to policymakers, it is clear that the total
benefits to society from reductions in crime are far broader than just the tangible costs averted to
the criminal justice system. Indeed, previous research on gun crimes in particular suggests that
intangible benefits from reduced crime may far outweigh tangible benefits (Cook & Ludwig
2000). Monetizing the value to society from reduced crime is challenging in part because of
complicated conceptual questions like the costs to society from drug use by individuals. Other
practical problems arise because the costs of crime are so skewed, with homicide being at least
an order of magnitude more costly than any other crime in most studies, and because there is no
perfect way to monetize the intangible costs of crime.
Conceptually, the ideal way to measure the value to society from reductions in crime in
the future is from an ex ante perspective – what is the aggregate sum of the public’s willingness
to pay (WTP) for reducing the risk of crime victimization in the future? Contingent valuation
(CV) surveys in principle are capable of capturing this WTP value, but in practice many people
are understandably nervous about relying on survey responses to hypothetical questions about
what people would be willing to pay to reduce crime. An alternative approach has been to rely on
jury award data. But jury awards adopt an ex post perspective after a victim is identified and so
are problematic from a conceptual perspective, and a very small and unusual subset of criminal
events result in civil litigation for damages (see Cohen 2005; Cook & Ludwig 2000).
We start by following the basic approach from Kling, Ludwig, and Katz (2005),
assigning each type of crime the social costs estimated by Miller, Cohen and Wiersema’s (1996)
that rely on jury award data, and examining the sensitivity of our estimates to how we handle the

54

social costs of homicides. We note that since our estimates are based on arrests, and not all
criminal offenses result in arrest, our estimates may understate the total social benefits from
averted crimes among treatment youth (although it is also true that not all arrested youth actually
committed the crime for which they were arrested). Because different types of crimes will
impose different costs on society, we assign each crime category a unique cost, aggregate the
costs across types of arrests for each youth, and use that individual cost-of-crime total per youth
as the outcome variable.
The top panel of Appendix Table A5 suggests that participation in the intervention
reduces the social costs of crime per youth between $7,140 and $11,983 per youth, or 70 to 80
percent of the control complier mean. The estimates are very imprecise largely because of the
very high costs of homicide and how few homicide arrests there are in the data. Although these
estimates are not quite significant at the 10 percent level, their magnitudes are noteworthy; a
$1,100 per youth program that has an 85 percent likelihood of saving from $7-12,000 per
participant is still likely to be of some interest to public policymakers (see for example Cook &
Ludwig 2006).
As the bottom panel of Appendix Table A5 shows, using estimates for the costs of crime
from contingent valuation studies (Cohen, et al. 2004), which tend to be higher than those from
jury awards, yields even larger estimates for the savings from our program due to reductions in
youth crime. Although these CV estimates for the social costs of crime are somewhat
controversial, it is worth noting that using this alternate calculation for violent crimes only
significantly increases our estimates of social savings due to the intervention. Since these
estimates are based on people’s willingness to pay to avoid violent crimes, they in theory already
incorporate how much people are willing to pay for reductions in future crime that is driven by
their desire to avoid having to pay in taxes in the future for direct criminal justice system costs.
The benefit calculations in the high-end estimate that use these figures (main text Table IX)
therefore subtract the direct taxpayer benefits from the total in Table A4.
Table IX in the main text also shows a lower-bound estimate for crime-reduction
benefits. This uses the LATE estimate on total arrests during the program year from the most
conservative bounding exercise, which adjusts for possible under-reporting of after-school
attendance (β = -0.1206 (0.0704), p = 0.087), and the lowest cost of crime estimates from Miller,
Cohen, and Wiersma (1996) (trimming murder costs by half).
Since the students in our sample are too young to have graduated, and most estimates of
the benefits of education are based on graduation, calculating the potential benefits of increased
school performance is more difficult. The first challenge is to extrapolate the implied effect on
future graduation rates from the estimated impacts on schooling outcomes that we observe
during our two-year study period. We find no significant difference in school persistence to date,
but our measures of persistence are noisy and many students are still too young to officially drop
out of school. We do, however, observe significant changes in GPA and course failures (and not
quite significant changes in days present). To our knowledge, there are no causal estimates of
how changes in GPA or days present for grades 7 – 10 affect later school completion.

55

The Consortium report discussed in the main text provides correlational estimates of the
relationship between graduation rates and GPA from longitudinal data. We use these rates to
estimate our sample’s probability of graduating based on their GPA, using the same KLK
approach to impute missing GPAs as for our main index48. We then use predicted graduation rate
as a dependent variable. The size of the LATE improvements on predicted graduation rates
(+0.0521 for the program year and + 0.1010 for the following year) imply 10 and 22 percentage
point increases respectively, compared to control complier means of 53 and 45 percent. Using
the lower-bound LATE estimates instead (+0.0336 and +0.0651 for the two years) translates to a
graduation increase of 6.6 and 13.6 percent by year, from the relevant control-complier baselines
of 50 and 48 percent respectively. These estimates provide our range of 7 to 22 percent increased
graduation reported in the main text. Because we think the more recent data from the follow-up
year might be a better indication of future graduation, we use the estimates from the 10-11AY in
monetizing the potential graduation benefits.
We would emphasize that this prediction involves a great deal of extrapolation (it is
based on correlational estimates for the entire district of 9th graders rather than a causal estimate
for our particular population of 7th – 10th grade boys). Our intent is to provide a sense of the
potential magnitude of the changes in the academic index, not to put a great deal of stock in the
specific estimates themselves.
Our second step is to then estimate the total monetized benefits to society from increased
high school graduation rates. We rely on estimates for the lifetime benefits of high school
graduation from Levin et al. (2007), who calculate the present discounted value of each
graduate’s earnings relative to a dropout’s, and how much a graduate contributes over his
lifetime in terms of additional taxes and lower health-care and welfare costs. Given the
characteristics of our study sample, we use Levin et al.’s estimates for black and Hispanic males
and inflate the figures to 2010 dollars. These calculations results in the figures in the bottom
panel of Table IX.

48

Note that this likely understates the amount of dropout, since some youth may be missing GPAs because they
have already dropped out. This possibility is consistent with the fact that the average graduation rate for everyone in
the schools we study (boys and girls) is only 40 percent; it seems unlikely that our sample of boys would have
higher than average expected graduation rates. However, results that instead assign a 0 probability of graduating to
youth who are missing GPA data and who CPS reports are no longer enrolled are very similar to those reported here.

Notes: All estimates in 2010 dollars. Low-end victim costs from estimates in Miller, Cohen &
Wiersma (1996), which include tangible costs (lost productivity, insurance and medical care, etc.)
as well as quality of life costs. They trim the cost of homicide by half and use the lower-bound
LATE estimate with conservative adjustment for attendance under-reporting. High-end victim
costs from Cohen et al.'s (2004) willingness-to-pay estimates and the main LATE estimate.
Savings to government are subtracted from Cohen victim costs since they should already be part
of the willingness-to-pay estimates. Government savings from reduced crime include arrest,
processing, detention, incarceration, diversion, and probation costs. Wage increase and
government savings associated with each additional graduate from Levin et al. (2007).
Government savings include increases in taxes paid and decreases in public health costs and
welfare transfers. Standard errors in parentheses. Baseline covariates included in all regressions.
