    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper I discuss some of the most important lessons on exchange rate policies in emerging markets during the last 35 years.  The analysis is undertaken from the perspective of both the Latin American and East Asian nations.  Some of the topics addressed include: the relationship between exchange rate regimes and growth, the costs of currency crises, the merits of \"dollarization,\" the relation between exchange rates and macroeconomic stability, monetary independence under alternative exchange rate arrangements, and the effects of the recent global \"currency wars\" on exchange rates in commodity exporters.\n\n",
