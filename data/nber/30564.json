    "abstract": "\n\nWe study two-way-fixed-effects regressions (TWFE) with several treatment variables. Under a parallel trends assumption, we show that the coefficient on each treatment identifies a weighted sum of that treatment\u2019s effect, with possibly negative weights, plus a weighted sum of the effects of the other treatments. Thus, those estimators are not robust to heterogeneous effects and may be contaminated by other treatments\u2019 effects. We further show that omitting a treatment from the regression can actually reduce the estimator\u2019s bias, unlike what would happen under constant treatment effects. We propose an alternative difference-in-differences estimator, robust to heterogeneous effects and immune to the contamination problem. In the application we consider, the TWFE regression identifies a highly non-convex combination of effects, with large contamination weights, and one of its coefficients significantly differs from our heterogeneity-robust estimator.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nSeveral of this paper\u2019s ideas arose during conversations with Enrico Cantoni, Angelica Meinhofer, Vincent Pons, Jimena Rico-Straffon, Marc Sangnier, Oliver Vanden Eynde, and Liam Wren-Lewis who shared with us their interrogations, and sometimes their referees\u2019 interrogations, on two-way fixed effects regressions with several treatments. We are grateful to them for those stimulating conversations. We are grateful to Yubo Wei for his excellent work as a research assistant. We are also grateful to the editor, associate editor, and two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments.
