It extends earlier work on capital controls by assuming that households manage their consumption and asset portfolios to maximize intertemporal utility. Our main result is that capital controls are effective in delaying, but not preventing, a breakdown of a fixed exchange rate regime in the presence of money-financed fiscal deficits.\n\n",
