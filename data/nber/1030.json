Particular emphasis is placed on the role of alcohol. Utilizing data for the tune period 1970 to 1975, multivariate equations are estimated for three timemperiods inmorder to examine and compare the before, immtediate,and longer run (one-year) impact of the changes in these relevant variables on mortality rates.The results reveal that changes in the minimum legal purchasing age of alcohol has contributed significantly to a higher mortality rate not only in the state instituting the change but in the border states as well.\n\n",
