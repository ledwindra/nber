    "abstract": "\n\nUnlike most advanced countries, the United States does not have a federal paid sick leave (PSL) policy; however, multiple states have adopted PSL mandates. PSL can facilitate healthcare use among women of child\u2212bearing ages, including use of family planning services. We combine administrative and survey data with difference\u2212in\u2212differences methods to shed light on these possibilities. Our findings indicate that state PSL mandates reduce birth rates, potentially through increased use of contraception services post\u2212mandate. Overall, our findings imply that PSL policies may help women balance family and work responsibilities, and facilitate their reproductive choices.\n\n",
