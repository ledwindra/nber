Employing survey data, household savings are cumulated as increases in net transactable wealth observed across three benchmark dates: January-February 1962, the first half of 1970, and August-September,1911. This paper describes how savings rates and the allocation of accumulated savings across different financial and real-estate assets varied with household circumstances. A sharp turn-around is observed between the 1960s and 1970s in the profiles of saving and homeownership for younger and older households.\n\n",
