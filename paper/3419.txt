ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CONVERGENCE
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES

ABSTRACT

A key economic issue is whether poor countries or regions tend to grow

faster than rich ones: are there automatic forces that lead to convergence
over time in levels of per capita income and product? After considering
predictions of closed- and open-economy neoclassical growth theories, we

examine data since 1840 from the U.S. states. We find clear evidence of
convergence, but the findings can be reconciled quantitatively with
neoclassical models only if diminishing returns to capital set in very

slowly. The results from a broad sample of countries are similar if we hold
constant a set of variables that proxy for differences in steady-state

characteristics. Two types of existing theories seem to fit the facts: the
neoclassical growth model with broadly-defined capital and a limited role for
diminishing returns, and endogenous growth models with constant returns and
gradual diffusion of technology across economies.

A key economic issue is whether poor countries or regions tend to grow faster than

rich ones: are there automatic forces that lead to convergence over time in the levels of
per capita income and product? We begin by considering the theoretical predictions
about convergence from the standard neoclassical growth model of a closed economy.

Because of diminishing returns to capital, poor economies have high rates of return and

therefore tend to grow faster than rich economies. In international extensions of the
neoclassical model, the convergence effect is reinforced by the movement of capital and
technology from rich economies to poor and of labor from poor economies to rich.

Our main empirical analysis deals with the growth of per capita income and

product for the U.S. states. We exploit data on personal income back as far as 1840 and
on gross state product since 1963. For studying the determinants of economic growth,
the experience of the U.S. states represents a vastly underutilized resource: in effect, we
have over a century of data on 48 economies (although surely not 48 closed economies!).

We find that the U.S. states provide clear evidence for the existence of convergence in
the sense of poor economies tending to grow faster than rich ones in per capita terms.
But the observed speeds of convergence can be reconciled with the neoclassical growth
model for closed economies only if we assume values for the underlying parameters of

preferences and technology that depart substantially from usual benchmark cases. In
particular, the model requires a high capital—share coefficient—in the neighborhood of

0.8—so that diminishing returns to capital set in slowly as an economy develops. The
required capital—share coefficient becomes even higher if we allow for open—economy

features, which would be important for the U.S states.
We compare our findings for the U.S. states with results from a cross—country

sample. Simple regressions for the growth rate of real per capita GDP from 1960 to
1985 for 98 countries indicate lack of convergence. The initially rich countries (in 1960)

tended to grow at least as fast in per capita terms as the initially poor countries. We
then add some additional explanatory variables, such as starting values of school-

2

enrollment rates and average ratios of government consumption spending to GDP, which
we argue hold constant cross—country differences in steady—state values of output per

effective worker and the growth rate of technology. In these extended regressions, we
find that the estimated convergence coefficients are similar to those revealed by the U.S.

states. Thus, there is evidence of convergence, but a reconciliation with the neoclassical
growth model again requires a high capital—share coefficient.

The empirical results push us toward growth models that view capital broadly to

include human capital, so that diminishing returns to capital set in slowly if at all. Two
existing models stand out as candidates for fitting the facts on convergence: the
neoclassical growth model with a limited role for diminishing returns and endogenous

growth models with roughly constant returns to capital. In the latter model, the
convergence effects that we isolate would have to be explained by the gradual diffusion
of technology across economies.

Convergence in the Neoclassical Growth Model
In neoclassical growth models for closed economies, as presented by Ramsey

(1928), Solow (1956), Cass (1965), and Koopmans (1965), the per capita growth rate

tends to be inversely related to the starting level of output per person. In particular, if
countries are similar in respect to preferences and technology, then poor countries tend

to grow faster than rich countries. Thus, there is a force that promotes convergence in
levels of per capita income. In this section, we quantify this type of convergence effect

from the neoclassical model. We begin with a sketch of the standard model; further
detail appears, for example, in Sala i Martin (1989).

The production function for the representative producer is

(1)

Y = F(K,

Lt)

3

where Y is the flow of output, K is the stock of capital, gt represents the effect of
exogenous labor—augmenting technological progress, and L is the labor force. Because
we neglect labor—leisure choices and also assume full employment, we treat the labor

force and population as equivalent. The key force that underlies the convergence effect

is diminishing returns to reproducible capital. That is, we make the usual assumption
that F(.) exhibits positive and diminishing marginal products in each input, as well as

constant returns to scale. Equation (1) can then be rewritten as

y=f(k)

(2)

where the symbol denotes a quantity per unit of effective labor, gt and f(.) satisfies
11>0 and

f"<O.

Output in a closed economy can be used for investment, K, or consumption, C. If
depreciation of capital is proportional at rate 5, then k evolves in accordance with

(3)

where c =

k = f(k) — c — (n+g+5)k

/Let and n is the exogenous growth rate of population and hence, of the

labor force, L.

The representative, infinite—horizon household seeks to maximize utility, as given
by

(4)

U=

Ju(c)ente_4otdt

where c = C/L and p is the constant rate of time preference. (We assume that p is high

4

enough so that the maximum attainable utility is finite.) The formulation assumes that
the household cares about per capita utility, u(c), multiplied by the membership of the

family, which grows as ent. We assume that the momentary utility function takes the
form

1—9

u(c)=C

(5)

—1

1—9

with 9>0,

so

that marginal utility, u'(c), has the constant elasticity —9 with respect to

c. As 9 tends to one, u(c) tends to log(c).
As is well known, the first—order condition for maximizing U in equation (4)

entails

(6)

The maximization

(i/O).[f'(k) — o—pJ

also involves a transversality condition,

which ensures that the

grows asymptotically at a rate less than the rate of return, f'(k). (This

requires p>n+(1—O)g.)

In the steady state, the effective quantities, y, k, and c, do not change. Therefore,
the per capita quantities, y, k, and c, each grow at the rate of exogenous technological

progress, g. The absolute quantities, Y, K, and C, grow at the rate g+n. The level of k
in the steady state follows by equating c/c to g in equation (6). Hence, using an asterisk
to denote a steady—state value,

(7)

f(k*)=5+p+Og

5

The level of y* follows from y = f(k) and the level of c* comes from setting the

expression in equation (3) to zero.
If a country or region—which we treat as a closed economy—starts with k below

k*, then equations (3) and (6) determine the dynamics of k, y, and c. The
transversality condition implies that k follows the stable, saddle path and thereby
monotonically approaches k* (see Blanchard and Fischer [1989, Ch. 2]). Equation (6)

implies that the growth rate of c is monotonically decreasing in k. That is, poorer
countries, which have lower values of k and therefore higher values of the rate of return,

f'(k), have higher growth rates of per capita consumption.

Because k rises along the transition path, the per capita quantities k and y must
grow at rates that exceed the steady—state value, g. It follows that the growth rates of
k and y decline with k in some neighborhood of the steady state. These growth rates
need not, however, be monotonically decreasing in k throughout the whole range of k.

That is, although the general tendency is for poorer countries to grow at higher rates, it
is possible to find a reverse pattern over some ranges of k. These reversals can arise
because of the dependence of the saving rate, s

[f(k) — c]/f(k), on

k. In the Solow

(1956) model, where s is arbitrarily assumed to be constant, the term, f(k) —c, in

equation (3) can be replaced by sf(k). It can then be shown readily that the growth
rates of k and y are each monotonically decreasing in k. That is, in the Solow model,
poor countries unambiguously grow faster than rich countries.

If the saving rate fell as k rose—which might be expected from the decline in the

rate of return, P(k)—then the tendency for growth rates to decline with k would be
reinforced. Thus, growth rates decline with k unless the saving rate rises substantially
(because of the income effect from an increase in k).

King and Rebelo (1989) simulate the transition path of the neoclassical growth
model for the case in which the production function is Cobb—Douglas:

6

(8)

where 0<a<1. King and Rebelo use various specifications of the parameters a, 5, p, g,
n, and 0. Their baseline case assumes a=1/3, 5=0.10 per year, p=O.054 per year,

g=0.011 per year, n=0.014 per year, arid 0=1 (log utility). With this specification, the
growth rate of y declines monotonically with k and, moreover, the saving rate also

declines monotonically. King and Rebelo then shift to a low intertemporal elasticity of
substitution, 0=10. This change reverses the behavior of the saving rate, which now
rises with k. Nevertheless, the growth rate of y still declines monotonically with k.
Thus, a monotonically declining growth rate of y applies over the range of plausible
values for the preference parameter, 0, that matters most for saving behavior.'
We can reproduce the main findings of the King—Rebelo simulations from
log—linearizations of the dynamic system (equations [3] and [6]) about the steady state.

+ log(y*).(1e)

'The growth rate of y still declines monotonically with k if 0 is much higher than ten.
King and Rebelo report a hump—shaped pattern for the growth rate of y if the utility
function is of the Stone—Geary form (which involves a "subsistence" level of per capita
consumption), so that the parameter 0 declines with per capita income. That is, the
willingness to substitute intertemporally is low (0 is high) when per capita income is
low. The tendency for 0 to fall over time introduces a force toward increasing per capita
growth rates. In equation (6), which determines the growth rate of per capita
consumption, the decline in 0 tends to raise the growth rate, whereas the rise in k (and
hence, the fall in V[k]) tends to reduce the growth rate.
2This solution selects out the stable root, which satisfies the transversality condition: In
the log—linearized model, the growth rate of y is always monotonically decreasing if y(O)
is below the steady—state value, y". The results of King and Rebelo (1989) indicate that
this property is satisfactory for a wide range of parameter values. See, however, n. 1,
which discusses a case in which the growth rate of y is not monotonically decreasing.

7

The positive parameter /3, which governs the speed of adjustment to the steady state,

depends on the underlying parameters of the model:

(10)

2/3 =

{h2

+ 4(i )(p+o+Og)[P++O — (n+5+g)J}h12 — h

where h = p—n—(1—O)g>O.
The average growth rate of per capita output, y, over the interval between dates

and t0+T is given by

(11)

(1/T).log[y(t0+T)/y(t0)] = g + (1- —ffF) •

-

[log[y*Iy(t0)]]

Therefore, given y*, the growth rate is higher the lower the value of log[y(t0)]. The

higher /3 the greater the responsiveness of the average growth rate in equation (11) to

the gap between log(y*) and log[y(t0)]; that is, the more rapid the convergence to the
steady state. Equation (10) expresses the dependence of /3on the underlying
parameters, but it is easier to see the nature of these relations numerically.
Because the crucial element for convergence in the neoclassical model is

diminishing returns to capital, the extent of this diminishing returns—that is, the size
of the capital—share coefficient a in the production function in equation (8)—has a
strong effect on /3. Table 1 and Figure 1 show the inverse relation between /3 and

a,

using a set of baseline values for the other parameters (p=O.O5 per year, 5=0.05 per

year, n=0.02 per year, g=0.02 per year, and 0=1). Thus, as in King and Rebelo (1989),
we assume log utility (0=1) for the baseline case. The value n=0.02 per year
corresponds to an average of population growth for the United States over the long

history. The other baseline parameters come from estimates reported in Jorgenson and
Yun (1986, 1990).

8

Table 1 shows that for small values of c, diminishing returns set in rapidly, 3 is

large and convergence is rapid. For example, at a=0.35—a capital share appropriate to
a narrow concept of physical capital (see, for example, Maddison [1987] )—the value
/3=0.126 per year implies a half—life for the log of output per effective worker of 5.5

years. That is, half the gap between log[y(t0)] and log(y*) vanishes in 5.5 years. For
a=0.80—which might apply if capital is interpreted broadly tO include human
capital—the value /3=0.026 per year implies a half—life of 26.9 years. Finally, as

approaches unity, diminishing returns to capital disappear, /3 tends to 0, and the
half—life tends to infinity. This setting without convergence effects is the one assumed
in endogenous growth models, such as Romer (1986) and Rebelo (1990), that assume

constant returns to a broad concept of reproducible capital.
Figures 2—6 show the effects from variations in the other parameters. In each case,

the parameters not being considered are fixed at their baseline values, including i=0.35.
Figure 2 shows that a higher U (reduced willingness to substitute intertemporally) lowers

the speed of adjustment. Figure 3 shows that a higher depreciation rate, 5, raises the
speed of adjustment. (With full depreciation, convergence to the steady state would be
immediate.) Figure 4 indicates that a higher time—preference rate, p, raises the speed of

adjustment. Figures 5 and 6 show that the rate of technological progress, g, and the
rate of population growth, n, have positive but small effects on the speed of adjustment.

The results that we report in these figures and in Table 1 correspond well to the
non—linear simulations carried out by King and Rebelo (1989) for a more limited range
of parameters.3

3Equation (10) implies that the effect of a on 3 is unambiguously negative and the effect
of 6 is unambiguously positive. Our numerical results indicate that the effects of the
other parameters are in the directions shown by the figures as long as the other
parameters are restricted to a reasonable range.

9

The main implication of the results for the subsequent analysis is that the baseline
specification shown in Table 1 generates a short half—life and a rapid speed of

adjustment. The speeds of adjustment that we estimate empirically in the next section
turn out to be much slower; the values for fi are in a range from 0.02 to 0.03 per year.
The theory conforms to the empirical findings only if we assume parameter values that

depart substantially from the baseline case. One possibility is a value of a around 0.8;

that is, in the range in which the broad nature of capital implies that diminishing
returns set in slowly. We can reduce the required value of a to around 0.5 if we assume
very high values of C (in excess of 10) along with a value of 5 close to zero.

Implications Qf

Open Economy

Thus far, we have carried out the discussion within the standard setting of a closed
economy. This framework is unrealistic for countries, but it is especially implausible for

the U.S. states, which we consider below. For our purposes, the important result is that
extensions of the neoclassical growth model to allow for features of an open economy

tend to speed up the predicted rate of convergence. That is, the predicted convergence
coefficient fi tends to be higher for given values of the parameters that we considered
before.

Poorer economies have lower values of k and—because of diminishing returns to

capital—higher values of the rate of return, f'(k). Therefore, mobility of capital across
countries or regions implies that capital will move from rich to poor economies. (Recall

the assumption that the production functions, f(.), are the same in all places.) This
process means that poor economies catch up faster than otherwise to rich economies in

terms of the values of k and y. It is possible to moderate this prediction in an
international context by arguing that the insecurity of property rights deters foreign

10

investment. Nevertheless, the predicted convergence with some capital mobility must
be greater than that for a group of closed economies.
Diminishing returns to capital imply that wage rates are increasing in k.
Therefore, the wage rate in rich economies exceeds that in poor economies and

international mobility of labor implies that workers will migrate from poor economies to

rich ones: As with the movement of capital from rich places to poor places, the shifting
of labor from poor to rich tends to raise the level of k in poor economies relative to that

in rich ones. Therefore, the mobility of labor tends also to speed up the process of
convergence in the neoclassical growth model.4

Finally, some models (such as Nelson and Phelps [1966]) bring in the transmission

of technology from rich to poor economies. The potential to imitate the leading
countries is another reason for poor, follower economies to grow at relatively high rates.

That is, it is typically easier to imitate than to innovate. Note also that, unlike the
effects from international mobility of capital and labor, this effect from the spread of
technology does not depend on diminishing returns to capital.
The closed—economy model implies that an economy's growth rate varies inversely

with the level of output per effective worker, y, relative to the steady—state position, y*.

Thus, if y is constant, the growth rate depends on the level of a country's or region's
per capita product, relative only to the steady—state path, which allows for growth at
the exogenous rate g. In contrast, the open—economy model introduces growth—rate

effects that involve the levels of per capita product in relation to the levels in other

economies. Thus, the prediction is that a region or country will grow faster if its per

If we introduce human capital, then the results may change. The conclusions remain the
same as long as the people who migrate are those with average or below average
quantities of human capital. If people with above—average amounts of human capital
are motivated to move from poor to rich economies, then mobility may slow down the
process of convergence. See Borjas (1990) for a discussion of the characteristics of
immigrants.

11

capita product is lower in comparison with that of other economies. Consider as an
example a proportionate increase in the levels of capital and output per effective worker
in all economies. In the closed—economy model, the per capita growth rate falls in each
economy because of diminishing returns to capital. In contrast, the open—economy
effects on growth—which involve the mobility of factors and technology—involve
inter—country comparisons of rates of return on capital, wage rates, and levels of

technical expertise, and do not depend, per se, on the level of world per capita product.
To summarize the main points, in the closed—economy model, the capital—share

coefficient, a, must be high to match the convergence coefficients that we estimate
below. For reasonable values of the other parameters of preferences and technology, the
required value for a is in the neighborhood of 0.8. Open—economy features tend to
speed up the convergence process; therefore, open—economy versions of the neoclassical

growth model require even higher values of a to fit the observed behavior on
convergence.

LIQ Concepts Qf Convergence
Two concepts of convergence appear in discussions of economic growth across
countries or regions. In one view (Barro [1984, Ch. 12], Baumol [1986], DeLong [19881,

Barro [1991]), convergence applies if a poor country tends to grow faster than a rich one,

so that—other things equal—the poor country tends to catch up with the rich one in
terms of the level of per capita income or product. The second concept (Easterlin
[1960], Borts and Stein [1964, Ch. 21, Streissler [1979], Barro [1984, Ch. 12], Baumol

[1986], Dowrick and Nguyen [1989]) concerns cross-sectional dispersion. In this context,

convergence occurs if the dispersion—measured say by the standard deviation of the
logarithm of per capita income or product across a group of countries or
regions—declines over time. Convergence of the first kind (poor economies tending to

12

grow faster than rich ones) works toward convergence of the second kind (reduced

dispersion of per capita income or product), but is offset by new disturbances that tend
to increase dispersion.

Consider a version of equation (11) that applies to discrete periods of unit length
(years) and is augmented to include a random disturbance:

(12)

log(y/y_1) = a—(1—i).[log(y_1) —g.(t—1)] + u

where a = g + (1e)log(y*), the subscript t denotes the year, and the superscript i

denotes the country or region. We assume that the random variable u has mean zero,

variance c, and is distributed independently of log(y_1), u for ji, and lagged
disturbances. We think of the random disturbance as reflecting unexpected changes in
production conditions or preferences. We treat the coefficient a as constant; this means,
in particular, that the steady—state value, (yI)*, is the same for all economies. The time
trend, g• (t—1), which reflects the exogenous technological progress, is also assumed to be
the same for all economies.

Convergence of the first kind applies if /3>0. Because the coefficient on 1og(y_1)

in equation (12) is (1—e), which is between zero and one, the convergence is not

strong enough to eliminate the positive serial correlation in log(y). Put
alternatively—in the absence of random shocks—convergence to the steady state is
direct and involves no oscillations.
Let

be the cross—economy variance of log(y) at time t. Equation (12) and the

assumed properties of u imply that

first—difference equation:

Equation (14) implies that a approaches the steady—state value, a2 = o/(1—e_2),
which rises with

but declines with the convergence coefficient, /3. Over time,. a falls

(or rises) if the initial value

is greater than (or less than) the steady—state value, or2.

Thus, a positive coefficient /3 (/3—type convergence) does not require a falling o (a—type

convergence). To put it another way, /3—convergence is necessary but not sufficient for
a—convergence.

Figure 7 shows the time pattern of o with

above or below a2 The

convergence coefficient used, /3=0.03 per year, corresponds to estimates for the United

States in the next section. With /3=0.03 per year, it takes about 12 years to eliminate

50% of the initial gap between o and a2 and about 23 years to eliminate 75% of the
gap.
The cross—sectional dispersion of log(y) is sensitive to shocks that have a common

influence on sub—groups of countries or regions. (These kinds of disturbances violate the

condition that u in equation (12) is independent of u for j#i.) Examples are shocks
that generate changes in the relative prices of agricultural commodities or oil. These
kinds of changes are favorable for some countries or regions and unfavorable for others.

For the United States, an important example from the earlier history is the Civil War.

14

This shock had a strong adverse effect on the incomes of southern states relative to the
incomes of northern states.
Formally, let St be a random variable that represents an economy—wide

disturbance for period t. For example, S could reflect the relative price of oil as
determined in world markets. Then equation (12) could be modified to

(15)

where

log(y/y1) = a — (1—e). [1og(y1) — gt] +

measures

+u

the effect of the aggregate disturbance on the growth rate in country

or region i. If a positive value of S signifies an increase in the relative price of oil, then
would be positive for countries or regions that produce a lot of oil. The coefficient '

would tend to be negative for economies that produce goods, such as automobiles, that

use oil as an input. We think of the coefficients ' as distributed cross sectionally with

mean and variance cT.
Equation (15) implies

(16)

c = (e2)._1 + + S•o + 2S.(e).CO V[1og(y

where the variances and covariance are conditioned on the current and past realizations

of the aggregate shocks, S, S1, ... If COV[log(y

] equals zero, then equation

(16) corresponds to equation (13), except that realizations of the shock St effectively
move

around over time. A temporarily large value of S (due, for example, to an oil

or agricultural shock or a war) raises

above the long—run value c2 that corresponds

to a normal (smaller) value of S. Therefore, in the absence of a new shock to S,
returns gradually toward

as shown in Figure 7.

15

It also follows when Iog(y_1) and

are uncorrelated that estimates of the

coefficient fi in equation (15) would not be systematically related to the realizations of

S. That is, the composite error term, •S + u, would be uncorrelated with the
regressor, log(y_1).

Suppose, alternatively, that COVf1og(y_1), '] > 0. That is, if a positive S
represents an increase in the relative price of oil, then countries or regions that produce

a lot of oil (1 > ) have above average per capita product in period t—1. In this case,
the derivative of the covariance term in equation (16) with respect to S is positive.

were perfectly correlated—so that

cr—o would be monotonically increasing in S. For the

oil example (in which oil—producing economies have above—average per capita product),

the results imply that an increase in the relative price of oil has a positive effect on the
cross—sectional dispersion of per capita product. A decrease in the relative price of oil

may lower this dispersion, and surely lowers it if the correlation between log(y_1) and
is unity.

If 1og(y) and

are positively correlated, then the coefficient estimated by OLS

on log(y_1) in equation (15) would be positively or negatively biased as S is positive or
negative. As an example, if oil producers have relatively high per capita product, then
OLS procedures tend to underestimate /3—convergence for a period in which the oil price

rises (St >

0)

and vice versa. In the empirical analysis in a later section, we hold

constant proxies for S as an attempt to obtain consistent estimates of the convergence
coefficient /3.

The Data for the U.S. States

We have two measures of per capita income or product across the U.S. states. The

16

first measure is per capita, nominal personal income. The U.S. Commerce Department
has published annual data on personal income for the 48 continental states since 1929
(see Bureau of Economic Analysis [1986]). We use the figures that exclude transfer
payments. Easterlin (1957, 1960) provides estimates of state personal income for 1840

(29 states or territories), 1880 (47 states or territories), 1900 (48 states or territories),
and 1920 (48 states). - These data also exclude transfer payments.

We do not have measures of price levels or price indexes for individual states.

Therefore, we deflate the nominal values for each state by a national price index for the

year. From 1929 to 1988 we use the U.S. deflator for national income. For the earlier
years, we use wholesale price indexes for all commodities. Given that we use the same

price deflator for each state in a single year, the particular deflator that we use affects
only the constant terms in the subsequent analysis. The use of the same deflator for

each state introduces two types of potential measurement error. First, if relative
purchasing—power parity does not hold across the states, then the growth rates of real

per capita income are mismeasured. Second, if absolute purchasing power parity does
not hold, then the levels of real per capita income are mismeasured.

The second type of data is per capita, nominal gross state product (GSP), which is
available annually from 1963 to 1986 (see Renshaw, Trott and Friedenberg [1988)). This
variable, which is analogous to gross domestic product, measures production within each

state. We deflate the nominal figures by the aggregate gross state product deflator for
each year. (This deflator is close to that for U.S. gross domestic product.)
The main differences between state personal income and gross state product
involve capital income. Personal income includes corporate net income only when
individuals receive payment as dividends, whereas GSP includes corporate profits and

depreciation. (Neither concept includes capital gains.) In addition, GSP attributes
capital income to the state in which the business activity occurs, whereas personal

17

income attributes it to the state of the asset holder. Some of these locational
considerations apply also to labor income, although—except for a few cities—the
location of a business and the residence of the workers are typically in the same state.

Evidence

—Convergence f.Q1 iJi LL.. States

We assume in this section that the neoclassical growth model described before

applies to each of the U.S. states as separate economies. (Thus, we assume that the
main effect from openness is that the convergence coefficient, fi, is higher than

otherwise.) We have data on real per capita income or product, y, for a cross section of

the U.S. states, i =

1,

..., N. Assume for the moment that we use data only at two

points in time: t0 and t0+T. Then equation (12) implies that the average growth rate
over the interval from t0 to t0+T is given by

(17) (1/T).log(y/y) = a— [(1_ 1)/T.log(y) +
where u

o'o +T represents

the average of the error terms, u, between dates t0 and

t0+T. The constant term, a = g + [(1—)/T. [log(y*)+gt0], incorporates the
constant and the time trend from equation (12) because the trend, gt, is the same for all
i. The coefficient a would shift with a change in the starting date for the sample, to.

Note that the coefficient on log(y ) is (1—e1)/T, which declines with the
0

length of the interval, T, for a given fi. Intuitively, as we consider longer intervals, the

effect of the initial position on the average growth rate must get smaller; in the limit as
T tends to infinity, the coefficient tends to zero. Our non—linear estimates of i take
account of the associated value of T. Therefore, we expect to obtain similar estimates of
3 regardless of the length of the interval.

18

Table 2 shows non—linear least—squares regressions in the form of equation (17) for

47 or 48 U.s. states or territories and for various time periods. Aside from log(y ),
0

each regression includes a constant and three regional dummy variables: south,

midwest, west. (To save space, the estimated coefficients for the constant and the
regional dummies are not shown in the table.) Because the regional dummies are held
constant, the effect of initial per capita income does not reflect purely regional

differences, such as the southern states catching up with the northern states.
For the longest interval, 1880—1988, the estimated convergence coefficient shown
in line 1 of Table 2 is /3 = .0175 (s.e. = .0046). Figure 8 shows the dramatic inverse

relation between the average growth rate from 1880 to 1988, zy18801988, and
log(y1880): the simple correlation is —0.93. Figure 9 and line 2 of Table 2 show that
the results are similar for the interval 1930—1988: /3 = .0143 (.0028).

The full time series for y (1880, 1900, 1920, and annually from 1929) potentially
provides more information about the coefficient /3. For a smaller value of T, however,

the error term in equation (17), u +T' represents an average of shocks over a shorter
0' 0
interval. Therefore, the estimates become more sensitive to the specification of the error
process. In particular, with serial persistence in the error term u, the correlation

between u +T and log(y ) is likely to be negligible for large T but substantial for
0'O
0
small T.
Table 2, lines 3—11, shows estimates of /3 for nine sub—periods of the overall
sample: 1880—1900, 1900—1920, ten—year intervals from 1920 to 1980, and 1980—1988.

Each regression includes a constant and the three regional dummies. The results show
values of /3 that range from —.0122 (.0074) for 1920—1930 to .0373 (.0053) for 1940—1950.

If all nine sub—periods are restricted to have a single value for /3, then the resulting

joint estimate, shown on line 12, is /3 = .0189 (.0019). This joint estimation allows each

19

sub—period to have individual coefficients for the constant and the regional dummies.5

This jointly estimated value of /3 is, in fact, close to the value, .0175, that was estimated

for the single interval 1880-1988. But, as would be expected, the standard error from
the joint estimation, .0019, is a good deal smaller than that, .0046, found for the single

interval.

The problem with the joint estimate is that the data reject the hypothesis that the
coefficient /3 is the same for the nine sub—periods. The likelihood-ratio statistic for this

hypothesis, 32.1, is well above the 5% critical value from the x2 distribution (8 d.f.) of
15.5.

Measures of Sectoral ComDosition

The unstable pattern of /3 coefficients across sub—periods can reflect aggregate
disturbances that have differential effects on state incomes, as represented by the term
in equation (15). For example, during the 1920s, the ratio of the wholesale price of

agricultural commodities to the CPI fell by 29%. The agricultural states also had
below—average per capita personal income in 1920; the correlation of log(y1920) with the

share of national income originating in agriculture in 1920 was —0.67. Thus, the
estimated coefficient /9 = —.0122 for the 1920—1930 period in Table 2 may reflect the

tendency of the poorer states to be agricultural and therefore to experience relatively
low growth in this particular decade.

To hold constant this type of effect, we construct a variable that measures the
sectoral composition of income in each state. For the sub-periods that begin since 1930,
we have a breakdown of the sources of labor income (including income from self

51t would be possible to restrict the constants if it were maintained that each state
experienced exogenous technological progress at the constant rate g. We could then use
the whole sample to estimate a single constant and the value of g. We have not imposed
these restrictions because we have no reason to think that the rate of technological
change would be the same over all time periods.

20

employment) into nine categories: agriculture, mining, construction, total

manufacturing, transportation & public utilities, wholesale & retail trade,
finance—insurance—real estate, services, and government & government enterprises. For
each sub—period, we construct a sectoral—composition variable for state i:

(18)

S1 =

where j indexes the sectors for the generation of income, w0 is the share of personal

income in state i that is generated at the start of the sub—period by sector j, and 'y

is

the growth rate for the sub—period of U.S. personal income that originates in sector j.
For example, if U.S. income in agriculture grows at a low rate in a particular

sub—period, then S' is especially low for agricultural states in that sub—period.

For the sub—periods that begin before 1930, we lack detailed data on the sectoral

composition of personal income. We do have data by state on the fraction of national
income originating in agriculture. For these sub—periods, we use this fraction as a

measure of S'. Note that the different methods of construction and the differing
behavior of agricultural relative prices mean that the coefficients of the variable S' will

differ from one sub-period to another. Therefore, we estimate a separate coefficient on
S' for each sub—period.

Lines 13—21 in Table 2 add the variable S' to the growth—rate regressions for each

sub-period. As before, these regressions include log(y ), a constant, and three regional
0

dummies. Not surprisingly, the estimated coefficients on the variable S' for the
post—1930 sub-periods are typically positive. That is, states in which income originates

predominantly in sectors that do well at the national level tend to have higher per
capita growth rates. (The estimated coefficient for the 1940—1950 sub-period is

21

negative, —0.40, s.e.

0.57, but not significantly so.) For the sub—periods that begin

before 1930, the negative estimated coefficient on S' signifies that, holding constant

initial per capita income and region, agricultural states have lower per capita growth

rates. This pattern is especially clear during the agricultural price collapse in the
1920—1930 sub—period: the estimated coefficient on S' is —.0936 (.0175).

For our purposes, the principal finding from the addition of the S1 variables is that
the estimated /3—coefficients become much more stable across sub-periods. The range is
now .0139 (.0076) for 1970—1980 to .0362 (.0055) for 1940—1950. Line 22 shows that the

jointly estimated coefficient for the nine sub—periods is .0249 (.0021). (This joint
estimation allows each sub—period to have individual coefficients for S', as well as for

the constant and the regional dummies.) The likelihood—ratio statistic for the equality
of /3—coefficients across the nine sub—periods is now 13.9, compared to the 5% critical

value of 15.5. Thus, if we hold constant the measures of sectoral composition, we no
longer reject the hypothesis of a single /3 coefficient at the 5% level. Note also that the
estimated value, /3 = .0249, is higher than that estimated on line 12, .0189, when the

variable S' was omitted.
The regression on line 23 of Table 2 includes the sectoral—composition variable
over the full sample 1930—1988. The estimated coefficient is now /3 = .0207 (.0049),

compared to .0143 (.0028) when the variable S' was omitted on line 2. (We cannot
include a single S' variable over the sample 1880—1988 because of missing data on
sectoral composition before 1929.)

The final result from Table 2 is a regression with the 29 available observations
from 1840 to 1880.6 This regression includes a constant and two regional dummies (no
6According to Easterlin (1960, pp. 124 ff.), the data for 1840 do not cover income
originating in wholesale & retail trade, finance—insurance—real estate, government, or
most other services. The figures that we use for 1880 in the 1840—1880 regressions are
comparable in coverage to those for 1840. This more limited coverage for 1880
comprises about half the income included in the measure that we used previously. In

22

western states are in the sample). We exclude the variable S' because the data are
unavailable. The estimate on line 24 is fi = .0254 (.0067), which accords with the
estimate of .0249 (.0021) for the sub—periods that begin after 1880 (line 22).

Figure 10 plots the per capita growth rate, y1840 l880 against log(y1840). A
remarkable aspect of the plot is the separation of the southern and non—southern states
because of the Civil War. In 1840, the southern and non—southern states differed little
in terms of average per capita income; the southern average was 94% of the
non—southern. But in 1880 a wide gap had appeared and the southern average was only
50% of the non—southern. The figure shows, however, that fl—convergence applies to the

southern and non-southern states as separate groups. That is, holding constant the
regional dummies (which effectively holds constant the impact of the Civil War), there

is a strong negative correlation between the per capita growth rate and the initial level
of per capita income.

As with the agricultural price collapse in the 1920s, the Civil War represents a

disturbance that affects states differentially. But, unlike the shock to agriculture in the
1920s, the effect of the Civil War on state per capita income has little correlation with

the initial level of per capita income. That is, the southern states—which were
adversely affected by the Civil War—did not have initial levels of per capita income

that were substantially below average. For this reason, we do not get a very different
point estimate of fi for the 1840—1880 sub-period if we eliminate the variables—in this

case the regional dummies—that hold constant the Civil War disturbance. Without
regional dummies, the estimate is fi = .0203 (.0 126). On the other hand, the R2 of the
regression falls from 0.91 in line 24 of Table 2 to 0.19; that is, the regional dummies

have a lot of explanatory power in this period!

any event, the limited figures for 1840 are not comparable to the data for years after
1880.

23

Results ii Gross StM Product
Table 3 and Figure 11 deal with the growth of per capita gross state product
(GSP) for 48 states over the period 1963—1986. Over the full sample, the estimated
convergence coefficient on line 1 of the table is /3 = .0180 (.0059). This regression

includes a constant and the three regional dummy variables, but no measures of sectoral
composition. The regressions over sub—periods (1963—1969, 1969—1975, 1975—1981,

1981—1986 on lines 2—5) show marked instability in /3: the range is from —.0285 in
1975—1981 to .1130 in 1981—1986. The joint estimate of 13 from the four sub—periods

(line 6) is .0211 (.0053), but the test of equality of coefficients is rejected
(likelihood—ratio statistic = 31.2, compared to the 5% critical value of 7.8).

We again add a measure of sectoral composition, S', which is analogous to that
defined in equation (18). Flowever, the data allow us to disaggregate into 54 sectors for
the origination of GSP. Lines 7—11 in Table 3 show that the /3 coefficients are similar
across the sub—periods when the variable S' is held constant. The joint estimate (line
= .0216 (.0042) and the hypothesis of stability across the four sub-periods is
11) is /3

accepted (likelihood-ratio statistic = 1.7, compared to the 5% critical value of 7.8).
The joint estimate of /3 from the GSP regressions is similar to that obtained with
personal income. The joint estimate for personal income in Table 2, line 22 is .0249

(.0021), which is slightly higher than that, .0216, found with GSP. However, if the

estimation for personal income is limited to a similar time span to that covered by
GSP—that is, the three sub—periods, 1960—1970, 1970—1980, and 1980—1988—the joint

The
estimate is /3 = .0181 (.0040), which is slightly less than that obtained with GSP.
main conclusion is that the estimated convergence coefficients are similar whether we
use personal income or gross state product.

Some of the instability in the 3 coefficients with the GSP data relate to the
movements in oil prices. Oil prices and hence, the incomes of oil states rose

24

substantially during the sub—period 1975—1981. Moreover, the oil states were already

relatively high in per capita GSP by 1975: the correlation of per capita GSP with the
share of GSP originating in crude oil and natural gas was 0.4. The tendency of the rich
oil states to grow at a relatively high rate upsets the usual convergence pattern and
thereby leads to the negative value for /3, —.0285, shown for 1975—1981 in line 4 of Table

2. But, when sectoral composition is held constant in line 9, the value of /3 for
1975—1981 is similar to that found in other periods.

For the 1981—1986 period, the key elements are the sharp decline in oil prices and

the high correlation, 0.7, between per capita asp and the share of GSP originating in oil
and natural gas in 1981. Accordingly, the tendency for oil states to do badly in
1981—1986 leads to an exaggerated convergence coefficient, /3 = .1130, in line 58 Again,

the inclusion of the S' variable in line 10 leads to a normal value for /3.

Effects of Measurement Error

The types of regressions that we have been running can exaggerate the estimated
convergence coefficient, /3,

if real income or product is measured with error. Aside from

the usual measurement problems, one reason to expect errors is that we divide all
nominal values in each year by a common price index.

Equation (17) can be rewritten as

(19)

(1/T).log(y)* = a + (e TI'/T).1og(y)* + Ut+T

TThis argument does not apply to the sub—period 1969—1975 (lines 3 and 8 of Table 2).
Although the oil price rose substantially over this period, the oil states did not have
especially high values of per capita GSP in 1969.
The results for personal income over the period 1980—1988 (Table 2, lines 11 and 21) do
not show the same pattern. The main difference seems to be that the correlation in 1980
of the logarithm of per capita personal income with the share of income originating in oil
and natural gas is close to zero.

25

where the asterisks indicate values measured without error. Assume that the observed

value at date t, log(y), differs from log(y)* by a random measurement error:

1og(y) = log(y)* +

(20)

For purely temporary measurement error,

would be white noise. Then, as is well

known, the measurement error in log(y ) implied by equation (20) leads to a bias
0

toward zero in OLS estimation of the coeffIcient, e/T, in equation (19). The extent
of the bias is increasing in the ratio of the variance of the noise, i, to the variance of

the signal, log(y)*. Because the term, e/T, in equation (19) is decreasing in /3, the
non—linear estimate /3 provides a corresponding overestimate of /3 in large samples.

We can obtain a bound for the inconsistency induced by temporary measurement

error. Equation (12) implies that the growth rate of income between any twofuture

dates, t0+r and t0+T, is given by

(21) [1 /(T—r)I log(y

where T>r>0 and u

0 '0

= a — [(e_fiT_)/(T_r)] log(y) +

r,t0+T

T is the average of the error terms between dates t0+r

and t0+T. Equation (21) relates the growth rate from t0+r to t0+T to the level of per
capita income at an earlier time, date to. Note that equation (17) corresponds to the
special case in which r=0.

We assume that the measurement error,
condition holds for all r>0 if

,

0

is independent of

for tr. This
0

is white noise, but also applies for large enough r to

measurement error with some persistence over time. We also assume that

is
0

26

0 '0+'r

independent of u

In this case, OLS estimation of equation (21) leads to an

underestimate of the magnitude of the coefficient, [(e_$Te_)/(T_r)]. We can show
that this term is increasing in 13 if 13 < [log(T/r)]/(T—r). In practice, we use the values

r=10 years and T=20 years or r=5 years and T=10 years. For the first pair of values,
the term [(e_13T_e ')/(T_-r)] is increasing in 13 if 13<0.07 per year; for the second pair,

the term is increasing in 13 if 13<0.14 per year. Therefore, for these ranges of 13 and in

large samples, the underestimate of the coefficient on log(y ) in equation (21)
0

corresponds to an underestimate of 13. Because this bias in 13 is opposite in direction to

that found for equation (19), we can use regressions in the form of equation (21) to
bound the size of the bias.
Consider the regressions for personal income in which each sub—period has

individual coefficients for the constant, three regional dummies, and the
sectoral—composition variable, S1. If we use only the five sub—periods from 1930—1940
to 1970—1980, then the joint estimate 13 in the form of equation (17) is .0244 (.0025),

which is close to the value for nine sub—periods from 1880 to 1988 shown in Table 2, line

22. The comparable result in the form of equation (21) with r=10 years and T=20
years is 13 = .0278 (.0049). Although the asymptotic biases induced by temporary

measurement error would be positive in the first case and negative in the second, the
result for 13 turns out to be higher in the second case. But the main finding is that the

values of j3 are similar in the two cases. Our inference is that temporary measurement

error does not have much influence on the results.
For gross state product, we used the three sub—periods, 1970—1975, 1975—1980,

and 1980—1985. The joint estimate 13 in the form of equation (17) is .0280 (.0058),

somewhat higher than that, .0216 (.0042), shown for four sub—periods from 1963 to 1986

in Table 3, line 11. Using r=5 years and T=10 years, joint estimation of equation (21)

27

over the three sub—periods from 1970 to 1985 leads to /3 = .0366 (.0091). Again,

contrary to expectations, the estimated value in the second case exceeds that in the first

case. But the main inference is that the results are similar and, hence, that temporary
measurement error is unlikely to be important.

Migration f Labor
As mentioned before, one way for the per capita product of poor and rich
economies to converge is for workers to move from poor places to rich places. Sala i

Martin (1990, Table 5.2) relates net migration for the U.S. states to initial values of per
capita personal income over sub—periods of the interval from 1900 to 1987. He confirms

that net in—migration is positively related to initial per capita income. But he also
notes (Table 5.4) that the estimated convergence coefficients, /3, are little affected by the
inclusion of net migration as an additional explanatory variable in a growth—rate

equation. In other words, his finding is that net migration of population plays a minor
role in the convergence results.

Sectoral Productivity
We can disaggregate total output (say, gross state product) into value added by
various sectors of production. Then we can break down the changes in overall

productivity—say output per worker—into changes in the sectoral composition of

output and changes in productivity within each sector. Sala i Martin (1990, Table 3.9)
shows that the /3—convergence for gross state product over the period 1963 to 1986

involves primarily the convergence of productivity within non—agricultural sectors. (He

lacked comparable data on agricultural productivity by state.) The convergence effect
shows up most strongly for manufacturing, but significant effects show up also for six

other sectors: construction, mining, services, transportation, wholesale and retail trade,

28

and finance—insurance—real estate. Thus, the poorer states tend to grow faster not only

in terms of overall output per person, but also in terms of labor productivity within
various sectors of production.

Analysis Qf q—Converence

Column 1 of Table 4 shows the behavior from 1840 to 1988 of

the standard

deviation of the logarithm of per capita personal income, log(y). For the 29 states or
territories with data in 1840,

rose from 0.30 in 1840 to 0.37 in 1880. This increase

reflects the shock from the Civil War. As indicated in Figure 10, the war generated a
large separation between the southern and non—southern states. If we compute o
separately for the southern and non—southern regions, then we find a substantial decline

in each case: from 0.26 to 0.12 for the south and from 0.32 to 0.18 for the north. Thus,

the Civil War appears as a major disturbance (like 'S in equation [15]) that is
superimposed on a pattern of declining cross-sectional variance of personal income.
Column 1 of Table 4 shows that

for 47 states or territories was 0.54 in 1880.

The coverage for income that underlies this figure is much broader than that used above

to compute u for 29 states or territories in 1880 (see n. 6). Thus, the figures shown for
47 or 48 states or territories for 1880 and later are not comparable to those shown for 29

states or territories for 1840 and 1880. (The shift in the level of
primarily to the change from 29 to 47 observations.) The value of

for 1880 is not due
falls from 0.54 in

1880 to 0.46 in 1900 and 0.32 in 1920. This decline reflects the a—convergence captured

by equation (14). If a1880 is above the steady-state value, a, and if major new shocks
that affect the states differentially do not occur, then
The increase in

declines toward a over time.

to the value 0.40 in 1930 likely reflects the impact of the

agricultural price collapse, which has already been discussed. The effect on a is
particularly strong because the adverse shock fell most heavily on states in which per

29

capita income was already below average. That is, in terms of equation (16), the
covariance between initial per capita income and the impact of the agricultural shock is
positive.

After remaining roughly stable during the 1930s,

falls dramatically during

World War II from 0.35 in 1940 to 0.24 in 1945. Then, after changing little until 1950,
falls gradually to 0.15 in 1975 and subsequently rises to 0.19 in 1988. The rise in
since the mid 1970s may relate to the fluctuations in the relative prices of oil and other
commodities. However, the timing of the interaction between oil shocks and

for

personal income is unclear. One consideration is that, unlike the agricultural price
shock in the 1920s, the share of income originating in oil and natural gas is not highly

correlated with per capita personal income. If the oil states had above—average per
capita income, then the effects of oil shocks on

would be more pronounced. (Since

the mid 1970s, the oil states have above—average values of per capita gross state

product, but not per capita personal income.)
Column 2 of Table 4 shows

gradual decline in

income. The rise in

from 1963 to 1986 based on per capita asp. The

from 1963 to 1975 is similar to the pattern found for personal
from 0.14 in 1975 to 0.17 in 1980 likely reflects the increase in

the relative price of oil. As already mentioned, the oil states have above—average values

of per capita GSP in this period; hence, the covariance between the impact of the shock

and initial per capita GSP is positive. As with the agricultural price shock of the 1920s,

this property makes a particularly sensitive to the shock (see equation [16]). The
decline in at after 1980 reflects the normal dynamics—assuming that a1980 is above the
steady—state value, a, in equation (14)—as well as the decline in the relative price of
oil.

ComDarisons jJj Findings across Countries
In this section we compare our findings for the U.S. states with analogous results

across countries. It is well known that growth rates of real per capita GDP are
uncorrelated with the starting level of real per capita GDP across a large group of
countries in the post—World War II period. Barro (1991) uses the Summers—Heston

(1988) data set along with other data to analyze the growth experiences of 98 countries

from 1960 to 1985. (The limitation to 98 countries, rather than the 114 market
economies with Summers—Heston GDP data from 1960 to 1985, comes from the lack of

information on variables other than GDP.) Table 5, line 1 shows that a regression for
the 98 countries in the form of equation (17) leads to the estimate, /3 = —.0037 (.0018).
The dependent variable is the growth rate of real per capita GDP from 1960 to 1985,
The only independent variables are a constant and the log of 1960 per

capita GDP, log(y1960). The main finding, also depicted in Figure 12, is the lack of a
close relationship between iy1960 1985 and log(y1960). In fact, the convergence
coefficient /3 has the wrong sign; that is, there is a small tendency for the initially rich
countries to grow faster than the poor ones after 1960.
These cross—country results contrast sharply with the findings discussed earlier for

the U.S. states. Figures 8, 9, and 11 and Tables 2 and 3 showed that, particularly over
the longer samples, there is a clear and substantial negative correlation between starting
per capita income or product and the subsequent growth rate. Line 5 of Table 5 uses a

specification for the U.S. states that parallels the one used for the countries. The
variables are based on gross state product over the time period, 1963—1986, and the

regression includes only log(y1963) and a constant as regressors. The estimate in this
case is /3 = .0218 (.0053).

Barro (1991, Table I and Figure II) shows that a significantly negative partial

relation between y1960 1985 and log(y1960) emerges for a large sample of countries if

31

some other variables are held constant. The set of other variables for the 98 countries in
the main results consists of primary and secondary school-enrollment rates in 1960, the
average ratio of government consumption expenditure (exclusive of defense and

education) to GDP from 1970 to 1985, proxies for political stability based on numbers of

revolutions, coups, and political assassinations, and a measure of market distortions
based on purchasing-power-parity ratios for investment goods. If we include these
variables for the 98 countries in the form of equation (17), then Table 5, line 2 shows
that the estimated convergence coefficient becomes fi = .0184 (0045). (The additional

variables are entered linearly into this regression.) This estimate of 13is no longer very
much below the cross—state value shown in line 5 of the table.

From the perspective of equation (17), the theory predicts a negative relation

between the initial level, log[y(t0)], and the subsequent growth rate, y, if we hold
constant the steady—state position, log(y*), and the steady—state growth rate, g. (The
constant a in equation [17] depends on log(y*) and g.) Because the steady—state

condition is f(k*) = p+S, the model implies that differences across economies in log(y*)
reflect differences in production functions and in the parameters p and 5. Variations in
g, the rate of technological progress (and hence, the long—run per capita growth rate),

are not explained within this model. Some of the recent theories of endogenous growth,
such as Romer (1990), suggest some determinants of g (such as the costs of doing

research, the nature of property rights in inventions, and the costs of absorbing new

technologies). Note that, for a given value of log[y(t0)], equation (17) implies that y is
increasing in Iog(y*) and g. Therefore, the theory implies that the relation between
log[y(t0)] and y will be negative unless the correlation between log[y(t0)} and the two
omitted factors, log(y*) and g, is substantially positive.
The U.S. states are likely to be reasonably homogeneous with respect to the

steady-state values, log(y*) and g. That is, the differences in initial positions, log[y(t0)],

32

may be relatively much greater. (This condition is especially compelling if the initial
differences reflect exogenous events, such as wars, world agricultural harvests, and oil

shocks.) In this case, the negative relation between iy and log[y(t0)1 would show up
even if the differences in the steady—state values are not held constant. The result for /3
shown in Table 5, line 5 is consistent with this perspective.

On the other hand, the sample of 98 countries likely features large differences in
the steady—state values, log(y*) and g; that is, in the underlying parameters of
technology and preferences that determine these long—run values. The correlation of

log[y(t0)] with log(y*) is likely to be substantially positive; that is, economies with
higher steady—state values of output per effective worker would have followed a path
that led them today to a higher level of output per person. Similarly, the correlation of

log[y(t0)] with g is likely to be positive. Because of these correlations, the simple
correlation between y and log[y(t0)] could be close to zero, as we found in the data.
(This point is made by King and Rebelo [1989, pp 12—13].) On the other hand, if we
include additional variables that hold constant some of the cross—country variations in

log(y*) and g, then the partial relation between y and log[y(t0)] should become more
negative. We interpret the additional variables that we added to the cross—country
regression (Table 5, line 2) in this manner. Accordingly, we view the estimate of /3 in
this regression—which is no longer very much below the values from the cross-state
regressions—as coming closer to the theoretical convergence coefficient.9

We can get further perspective on these arguments by considering a groupof
relatively homogeneous countries. We examine here the 20 original members of the

The theory implies that the coefficient /3 depends on some of the underlying parameters
of preferences and technology. Hence, /3 also varies across countries. On the other hand,
there is no reason to expect a particular correlation between /3 and the proportionate gap
between output per effective worker and the steady-state value, 1og[y(t0)/y*.
Therefore, our regressions may provide satisfactory estimates of the average /3 for a
group of countries.

OECD.'° Table 5, line 3 shows that the estimated convergence coefficient, /3 = .0095
(.0028), is significant and of the expected sign even when no additional variables are

included. The magnitude is, however, about half that applicable to the U.S. states

(Table 5, line 5). Our interpretation is that the OECD countries are intermediate
between the 98—country group and the U.S. states in terms of the extent of
cross—country variation in steady—state values, log(y*) and g, relative to the variation

in initial positions, log[y(t0)]. Line 4 of the table shows that the estimate for the OECD
countries becomes /3 = .0203 (.0068) when the additional variables discussed before are

added to the regression. This result is very close to the estimate for the U.S. states,
.0218 (.0053), in line 5.

We have also explored in a preliminary way the addition of variables to the
cross—state regressions. One variable that has a significantly positive influence is the
fraction of the work force in 1960 that had accumulated some amount of college

education.'t We added this variable along with the regional dummies and
sectoral—composition variable, S', that we discussed before. Table 5, line 6 shows that
the estimated convergence coefficient becomes /3 = .0236 (.0013). Thus, the inclusion of

these other variables has a positive, but minor, effect on the estimate of /3 across the
U.S. states; /3 rises from .0218 on line 5 to .0236 on line 6. Overall, the impact on /3 is

greatest for the 98 countries (.0184 on line 2 versus —.0037 on line 1), next most

important for the 20 OECD countries (.0203 on line 4 versus .0095 on line 3), and least

important for the 48 U.S. states. These findings are consistent with the idea that first,
the other variables help to hold constant cross-sectional differences in the long—run

Zealand) because of the possibility that the extension of membership was endogenous

values, log(y*) and g, and second, that the ranking of the extent of these differences
(relative to the differences in initial levels of per capita income) goes from the 98

countries to the 20 OECD countries to the 48 U.S. states.

oP—Convergence fr Countries

Table 4, column 3 shows that

the standard deviation of the logarithm of real

per capita GDP, for the 98 countries increased steadily from 1960 to 1985. Column 4 of

the table shows that

also rose steadily from 1950 to 1985 for the 60 countries for

which the data are available. (See Streissler [19791 for comparable results.) Not

surprisingly, the level of these standard deviations is far greater than that shown in
column 2 for GSP for the U.S. states. (The concepts are, however, not strictly
comparable because the Summers—Heston (1988) numbers deflate each country's GDP
by a PPP—based price deflator, whereas the cross—state numbers divide the nominal

figures by a national price index.)
Column 5 of Table 4 shows that

for the 20 OECD countries declined steadily

from 1950 until the mid 1970s and then remained roughly stable from 1975 to 1985.

This behavior is broadly similar to that for the U.S. states (column 2), although the
U.S. values are more variable after 1975. The level of

for the OECD countries is, not

surprisingly, intermediate between that for the U.S. states and that for the 98 countries.

Conclusions

Our empirical results document the existence of /3—convergence; that is, the

tendency for economies that are further below the steady-state position to grow faster.
This phenomenon shows up clearly for the U.S. states over various periods from 1840 to

1988. Over long samples, poor states tend to grow faster than rich states even if we do

not hold constant any variables other than initial per capita income or product. If we

35

hold constant the region and measures of sectoral composition, then the speed of
convergence appears to be roughly the same—about 2 to 2—1/2 percent per
year—regardless of the time period or whether we consider personal income or gross

state product.
We find evidence of fl—convergence for a sample of 98 countries from 1960 to 1985

only if we hold constant a number of additional variables, such as school—enrollment

rates in 1960 and the average ratio of government consumption spending to GDP. We
interpret these variables as proxies for the steady—state ratio of output per effective

worker and the steady-state per capita growth rate. If we hold constant these
additional variables, then we estimate fl—coefficients that are similar—roughly 2% per

year—to those found for the U.S. states.
The standard neoclassical growth model with exogenous technological progress and

a closed economy predicts fl—convergence. To match our quantitative estimates,
however, we have to assume underlying parameters for preferences and technology that

depart substantially from standard benchmark cases. In particular, for reasonable
values of the other parameters, the model requires a capital—share coefficient, a, in the

neighborhood of 0.8. Lower values of a, which imply that diminishing returns to capital
set in more quickly, imply a more rapid rate of convergence than that revealed by the

data.
Extensions of the neoclassical model to an open economy tend to speed up the
process of convergence; the mobility of capital, labor, and technology implies that poor

economies catch up faster to rich ones. Therefore, an open economy requires an even

higher value of the capital-share parameter, a, to match the empirical results.
Some recent models of endogenous economic growth, such as Rebelo (1990),

assume constant returns to a broad concept of capital that includes human capital. This
specification corresponds to a=1.0 in the neoclassical model. As mentioned, our

36

empirical results indicate that the neoclassical model requires a value of a of around 0.8
(or higher in the open—economy versions) to fit the observed speeds of convergence. The

difference between a=0.8—where diminishing returns to capital set in slowly—and

a=1.0—where diminishing returns set in not at all—may seem to be minor. But, as
shown in Table 1, the difference amounts to a half life of 27 years in the former case

versus infinity in the latter. Thus, a value for a of 0.8 is very far from 1.0 in an
economic sense.

In the open-economy versions of the neoclassical growth model it is possible to
find convergence effects associated with technological diffusion even if the returns to

capital are constant (a=1). (Recall that the convergence effects from the mobility of
capital and labor depend on diminishing returns to capital.) Thus, we would like to
break down the observed /3—convergence into various components: first, effects related

to diminishing returns to capital in the context of a closed economy; second, effects
involving the mobility of capital and labor across economies; and third, effects that

involve the gradual spread of technological improvements. The present empirical
results, which exploit only cross—sectional differences in growth rates, do not allow us to

separate the observed convergence patterns into these components. We hope to make
these distinctions in future research, which will also exploit the time—series variations of

growth rates.

applies to real per capita gross state product (GSP) for 48 U.S. states.
Column 3 refers to real per capita GDP for the 98 countries studied in Barro
(1991). Column 4 uses the 60 countries for which data on CUP are available
since 1950. Column 5 applies to the 20 original OECD countries; see the notes
to Table 5 for a listing of the countries.

Notes: The dependent variable in regressions 1-4 is the growth rate of real
per capita CUP from 1960 to 1985; in regressions 5 and 6 it is the rowth
rate of real per capita CSP from 1963 to 1986. The coefficient fi applies in

regressions 1-4 to the logarithm of real per capita GDP in 1960; in

regressions 5 and 6 to the logarithm of real per capita CS? in 1963. Each
regression also includes a constant. The additional variables included in
regressions 2 and 4 are the primary and secondary school-enrollment rates in
1960, the average ratio of government consumption expenditure (standard
figures less spending on defense and education) to CUP from 1970 to 1985,
the average number of revolutions and coups per year from 1960 to 1985, the
average number of political assassinations per capita per year from 1960 to
1985, and the average deviation from unity of the Sumniers-Heston (1988)
purchasing-power-parity ratio for investment in 1960. See Barro (1991) for
details on these variables. The additional explanatory variables included
in regression 6 are regional dummies, the sectoral-composition variable, S',
and the fraction of workers in 1960 that had accumulated some amount of
college education. The 20 OECD countries (the original membership in 1960)
are Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.
