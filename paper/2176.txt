Carrots and Sticks: Pay, Supervision and Turnover

ABSTRACT

Large and persistent differences across industries in wages paid for given
occupations have commonly been observed. Recently, the efficiency wage model
(EWN) has been advanced as an explanation for these wage differentials. The
shirking version of the EWM assumes a trade—off between self—supervision and
external supervision.
The turnover version assumes turnover is costly to the
firm.
Variation across firms in the cost of monitoring/shirking or turnover
then are hypothesized to account for wage variation across firms for homogeneous
workers.

This paper presents empirical evidence of the trade—off of wage premiums
for supervisory intensity and turnover. A new sample of 200 firms in one sector
in one state in 1982 is analyzed. Little evidence Is found to support either
version of EWM. The substantial variation in wages for narrowly defined occupations across firms remains largely unexplained.

1. Introduction
Large and persistent differences in pay for a given occupation are commonly

observed across establishments and industries.

If both workers and jobs are

homogeneous, such differences are not predicted by standard theory.

Such

findings have then been taken as the basis for more complex theories of wage
determination.

Principal—agent models extend standard theory to cases of imperfect information.

This paper examines the particular case in which employees cannot

directly and costlessly observe a worker's effort or output. The monitoring
problem may be addressed either by purchasing more direct supervision, or by
purchasing self—supervision.

The latter choice results in what appear to be

occupation and firm specific wage premiums.

The aim of this paper is to de-

termine whether there is evidence to support monitoring problems as an explanation for differences across plants in occupational wages. In particular, this

paper searches for empirical evidence of a trade—off in production between
supervision and wage premiums.

A second version of the efficiency wage model explains wage premiums as a

mechanism to reduce turnover.

Firms which find turnover particularly costly

will find it profitable to offer wage bonuses so as to reduce turnover. This
paper also offers empirical evidence of the tradeoff between turnover and wage
premi ums.

These two variants of the efficiency wage hypothesis are discussed further

in the next section. The accumulated evidence on industry and establishment
differences in occupational wages is surveyed in Section 3. Section 4 describes

the plant level data on wages and supervision analyzed here.

Tests of the

trade—off between wage premiums and supervision are presented in Section 5.

Section 6 presents tests of the effect of wage bonuses on turnover. The conclusions follow.

2.

Efficiency Wage Models
The foundations of efficiency wage theory are reviewed by Katz (1986), from

which this section draws.

Following Yellen (1984), consider an economy of

identical firms in perfect competition, each with production function:

P = aF[e(w)L]

(1)

where

e = The efficiency function giving the effort of the worker,
> 0, e'1 < 0
L = Number of employees, all homogeneous
w = Real wage
Q = Output
a = Productivity shifter

The profit maximizing firm chooses both the level of wages, and the quantity

of labor to satisfy:

(2)

eI(w*)w*/e(w*) =

1

and
(3)

e(w*)aFI[e(w*)L] =

In other words at the optimal wage, the elasticity of effort with respect to
the wage is equal to 1.

This minimizes wage costs per efficiency unit of labor.

The second condition i s standard:

marginal product equals marginal factor

price. This model has been offered as an explanation both for unfalling
wages

2

in the face of unemployment, and for wage dispersion across firms for identical
workers.

This basic efficiency wage model has been developed in a number of versions

(Akerlof, 1984; Stoft, 1982).

The shirking and turnover variants concern us

here. The shirking model is driven by imperfect information: the firm cannot
perfectly observe the effort or output of workers, and supervision is costly.
The firm cannot impose "ultimate" sanctions on employees: threats of infinite

cost (hanging) sufficient to compel non—shirking with infinitesimal supervision.

Nor can firms fine, sue, or extract performance bonds from workers.

Piece rates are also assumed to be impracticable given the difficulty of ob-

serving effort or output. The firm's problem is then to develop an effort—
eliciting pay mechanism. Wage premiums may offer the appropriate incentives
for self—supervision.

Such shirking models are developed in Shapiro and

Stiglitz (1984) and the earlier literature reviewed there.

Wage dispersion for identical workers arises in such models because of
differences across firms in 1) the cost of monitoring, and 2) the cost to the
firm of employee shirking. The level of such bonuses depends in turn on 3) the
expected duration of employment.

The turnover variant of the efficiency wage model is similar in structure

to the shirking variant. Assume firms bear part of the costs of turnover, and
that turnover decreases with wages.

Firms with higher turnover costs have an

incentive to pay high relative wages to reduce turnover. See Salop (1979) and
Stiglitz (1974). Firms also have an incentive to use tenure bonuses, or to have
workers post bonds or pay for their own hiring and training costs. For evidence

against the use of tenure bonuses, see Abraham and Farber (1985) and Altonji

and Shakotko (1985).

Where these alternatives are restricted, the turnover

3

model predicts that high wages, associated with high turnover costs, will cause

lower turnover rates. This is an empirically testable proposition.

3. Past Studies: Industry Wage Effects
To my knowledge, there have been no past studies of the efficiency wage
hypothesis at the level of the firm.'

This appears to be due to the absence

of requisite information in the commonly used data sets, and to the rarity of
any studies of firms.

There is a lo'ng tradition showing differences in wages paid in the same
occupation across industries. Dunlop (1957), for example, shows that in Boston

in 1951, the industry with the highest pay for truck drivers paid 1.88 times
as much as the lowest paying industry. He ascribes these substantial differences to underlying differences in product markets.

Slichter (1950) finds a high rank correlation (.71 in 1939) of unskilled

and skilled wages in an industry. At any point in time, such a positive correlation of unskilled and skilled wages could reflect a transitory demand shock
temporarily driving up industry wages along a short—run inelastic supply curve.

If so, we would not expect to see the same industries stay at the top of the
wage distribution decade after decade. Yet, industry wage differentials appear
to be remarkably persistent over time.

Slichter (1950), Cullen (1956), Reder

(1962), Montgomery and Stockton (1985), Bell and Freeman (1975), and Krueger
and Summers (1987) all present evidence of persistent industry wage differentials over differing periods ranging from 1895 to 1984.

Taken together this

is a century of persistent and largely unexplained industry wage effects.

4

Behind the Industry Wage Effect
Two regularities appear to stand out from studies that attempt to account

for systematic differences in pay within occupations across plants or industries. Higher wages are usually associated with 1) higher profits or concen-

tration, and 2) larger plants and larger firms (the size wage effect).

The

chief suspect in this search is product market power. Ability to pay appears
to be associated with industry wage premiums.

Dickens and Katz (1987), and

Krueger and Summers (1987) offer useful reviews.

A strong, positive relationship between wages and plant or firm size is

also persistently observed, see Brown and Medoff (1984), and the literature
reviewed there. Assuming that direct supervision is more difficult in larger
plants and companies, this has been taken as direct evidence in favor of the
efficiency wage hypothesis.
It is not obvious why the owners of a firm should share their economic rents

with their workers, although the morale version of the efficiency wage model

offers a possible explanation.

Unobserved quality differences in workers

leading to both higher wages and profits offers another, Cain (1976). From the

perspective •of the shirking model, it is troublesome that wage differentials

tend to be dominated by employer, rather than occupation effects (Nolan and
Brown, 1983), and that at the establishment level much of the differential is
accounted for by the unionization and gender of the workers (Groshen, 1985).

Tests of the Efficiency Wage Hypothesis

The earliest applications of the efficiency wage hypothesis were to the
output and pay of agricultural workers near starvation. The output effects of
wage bonuses in developed economies have not yet been shown.

Two provocative

and interesting recent studies set the stage for such tests (Dickens and Katz,

5

1987; Krueger and Summers, i987). They present a variety of evidence suggesting

that neither transitory demand shifts, unobserved human capital, nor compensating differentials can easily account for the observed industry wage differ-

entials, which persist across time and countries. However, the advantage of
efficiency wage models in explaining these wage differentials remains to be
shown.

More direct tests of the efficiency wage hypothesis are offered by Krueger

and Summers (1987), who show that wage premiums are (1) negatively associated

with quits, and (2) positively associated with tenure and with self—reported
effort and job discretion. In both cases, the effects do not appear to be large

enough to make the payment of wage premiums profitable, and both may reflect
unobserved quality differences.

4. Data
All of the data analyzed here come from a survey of employment conditions

in the high—technology sector of one state. In 1982 this survey includes more
than 200 plants with more than 70,000 employees. Employees are placed into one
of 290 narrow occupational classifications. For each occupation in each plant,

the number of employees and average pay are reported.

In most cases, a plant

is the sole operating asset of a firm, so one could use the terms interchangeably.

This study analyzes average pay by occupation by plant, which is the average

of the base pay rate for individuals in a single occupation.

It includes

cost—of—living or geographic differentials, and excludes shift differentials,
lead premiums, or other differentials which are not considered base pay. Extra

compensation which is not regularly paid and considered as part of the normal
base pay is excluded.

Commissions and incentive pay which are part of total

6

targeted earnings are included.

In other words, for incentive pay jobs, the

expected value of total pay is reported, deviations from the expected value are

not. The pay and employment2 data anaiyzed here are for the pay period closest
to Sepfember 1, 1982.

Wage bonuses are taken here as the deviation of plant

wages by occupation from the sample mean.

Firms are provided with 290 detailed job descriptions that reflect the
normal range of duties, responsibilities and requirements found in each level
of the specified job. Employees that do not match a job description by at least

roughly 80 percent are to be excluded. The job descriptions are detailed, and
the occupational classifications narrow.3

Data on supervision comes from the same survey. Organizational charts
showing hierarchies and time allocation of supervisors are not available. Instead, for a number of occupations, matching supervisor or manager occupations
are reported. For example, the relation of order processing clerks, purchasing

assistants, and field service workers to the occupations of order processing
supervisors, purchasing manager, and field service supervisor is readily apparent.

I have limited the analysis to sets of workers and supervisors for which

the supervisory relationship seemed complete and exclusive from the
descriptions.4
cluded.

job

Absent an actual organizational chart, error cannot be pre-

In particular, supervisory intensity is incorrectly low where higher

or lateral supervisors oversee a particular operation, and it is incorrectly
high where direct supervisors oversee other occupations in addition to the ones
specified here.5

Throughout this paper I assume that the very detailed occupational classifications used here serve as a control on worker quality that is at least as

good, If not better than, the commonly used age and education measures. Note

7

also that this data is bought and paid for by the participants, rather than by

academicians or the government. By the market test of survival, it has proven
its usefulness to survey participants, and that usefulness depends on accuracy

and reliability. In particular, the occupational categories used in the survey
are those that participating firms believe best reflect their own jobs.

5. The Tradeoff of Wage Premiums for Supervisory Intensity
In theory, considering the same occupation in different firms, the efficiency wage model predicts that firms employing more supervisors per worker will

offer lower wage premiums. Supervisor intensity and wage bonuses are substitutes in production. This section presents tests of the tradeoff between wage
premiums and intensity of supervision for six occupations in subsamples of 19

to 111 manufacturing plants.

Consider a production function of the general

form:

-

(4)

Q =

Q[e(P,S/L)L]

e1,e2, > 0
e 22' e12 < 0

where:
Q =

output

P = wage premium for workers

S/L =
e =

ratio of supervisors
effort function

to workers

Along an isoquant, higher levels of P are associated with lower levels of
SIL.

In principle, this is testable. In practice, the usefulness of any such

test will depend critically on 1) the ability to control for variations in
output Q, and 2) the ability to hold occupation fixed, or control for the cost

of shirking. For the former, this section relies on measures of number of em—

8

ployees; for the latter it relies on the use of occupations narrowly defined
within one industry by industry participants.
To test for substitution bbtween two factors of production, by regressing
one (wage premiums) on the other (supervisory intensity) is by no means an ideal

procedure, and is open to a number of criticisms, many of which are shared by
substantial parts of the production function literature. First, factor mix is
in theory a function of factor prices, and perhaps scale. Within a single industry in a single geographic area, one might expect little variation in factor

prices. Without such variation, the elasticity of substitution in production
cannot be well identified.

What variation is observed may then represent

transient optimization errors, rather than the production function. Second,
the choices of levels for both factors of production are endogenous and jointly
determined. In this case, the error term in the wage equation may be correlated

with the measure of supervisory intensity.

I attempt to control for variations

in output quantity by including a measure for number •of workers on the right

hand side.

This is obviously troublesome because labor input is itself

endogenous. If output is not adequately controlled for, or if what is labelled
a single occupation here is not homogeneous with respect to shirking costs, then

this procedure biases towards finding a positive correlation between supervisory intensity and wage premiums.

This makes any finding of a tradeoff more

compelling, but renders the precise interpretation of a positive correlation
doubtful.

The results to be presented here should be interpreted with this

caution in mind. With longitudinal data, one could try to limit the scope of
such problems by estimating first difference equations.

The first question to be addressed is whether thereis a substantial
occupation—specific element of wage differentials, or alternatively, whether
the firm effect on wages is similar across occupation. The shirking model is

9

consistent with the former but not the latter case, because it predicts different monitoring difficulties across occupation, rather than a constant firm
effect across occupations. Among the compelling pieces of evidence against the

shirking model so far is the finding (Dickens and Katz, 1987) in CPS data of
highly correlated industry effects across occupations.

To test whether firm effects on wages are highly correlated across occupations, I select six common occupations in which shirking or heterogeneity are

likely to be a relatively minor problem. Table 1 shows the correlation coef-

ficients for these six occupations across subsamples of 48 to 91 companies.
Most of the occupational wages are positively correlated with each other, and
a number of these are significant, but there are also a number of insignificant

and negative correlations.

Firms that pay high wages in one of these occupa-

tions do not also pay high wages in the others. Wage differentials across firms

do not simply reflect a constant firm effect, but also reflect occupation—
specific components. This result stands in contrast to the Dickens and Katz
finding of strong industry wage effects across occupations, using more aggre-

gated occupations and industries. Aggregation across occupations, and firms
would tend to average out distinctions, and so could help explain the difference

between these two results.

The finding here of little constant firm effect

across narrowly defined occupations leaves scope for the shirking model. At

the same time this finding casts doubt on simple equity theories which hypothesize strong firm effects on wages across occupations.

Table 2 presents characteristics of the sample for six additional occupa-

tions chosen using the following criteria:

1) they are found in substantial

numbers in a large proportion of companies; 2) they have clearly defined
supervisors who are likely to supervise the respective workers and no one else;

3) they appear to have only one set of direct supervisors; 4) they appear to

10

be homogeneous across firms; and 5) effort may not be easily observable and
failure to perform may be costly to the firm.

No other occupations fulfilled

these criteria, although their application obviously involves personal judge—
ment.

There is indeed substantial variation across firms in a single industry
and area in the average wage paid to workers. The coefficient of variation of
wages among these occupations ranges from .14 field service workers to .22 for

testers and machinists.

In five of these occupations, the firm paying the

highest average wage pays more than twice the lowest average wage. This is the
sort of wage dispersion that industrial relations experts have long pointed out,

and which efficiency wage theory now attempts to explain.
The occupations in Table 2 are ordered from lowest to highest average wage.

If one thought these occupations differed greatly in cost of shirking but had

similar factor price ratios of external to self—supervision, then the supervision to worker ratios should follow the same ranking. Table 2 shows no gen-

eral evidence that differential shirking costs across occupations dominate
twists in factor price ratios and result in both higher supervisory ratios and

higher costs. Note that outlying firms with zero supervisors in a given occu-

pation, or with more supervisors than workers, have been excluded from the
sample.

Within occupations there is no significant evidence of a tradeoff between

wage premiums and supervisory intensity.

Table 3 shows the results of re-

gressions of worker wages on the ratio of supervisors to workers. If shirkers
are more of a potential problem in larger units, and if scale effectsdominated
this data (or if workers demanded a compensating differentialfor working under
supervisors), we would expect to see strong positive correlations between wages

and supervisory intensity. If the efficiency wage hypothesis played an impor—

11

tant role in explaining wage premiums, we would expect to see a strong negative

coefficient on the supervisor variable. What we actually see in Table 3 can
best be described as noise, compounded in some cases by few degrees of freedom.

There is substantial variation in wages in these occupations, but there

is

little evidence that the efficiency wage model helps to explain this
variation.6 In other regressions (not shown) of the average workers' wage aggregated over all occupations, aggregate supervising intensity again has an
insignificant and small effect.7

Factor Quantities as a Function of Factor Prices

This section tests for substitution between factors of production by regressing the ratio of factor quantities on the ratio of factor prices.

In the

usual application this has the virtue of relegating the endogenous variables
to the left hand side. The results of regressions of the ratio of supervisors
to workers on the ratio of supervisors' wages to workers' wages are presented
in Table 4.

In each of the occupations, firms not reporting supervisors, or

supervisors' wages are deleted from the sample. Controls for detailed industry,
area, and scale are included.

As the standard theory predicts, the wages of supervisors relative to
workers increases when the ratio of supervisors to workers employed falls. This

effect is found in all occupations except testers, but is only significant in
the case of machinists.

The interpretation of this effect is complicated in

efficiency wage models because wages are choice variables.

It is clear that

The negative correlation between supervisory intensity and

12

workers' wages (so a positive coefficient in these regressions) predicted by
the shirking model is not generally apparent in these estimates.8

Output, Supervisory Intensity and
A production function may be characterized by observing how output varies

as inputs change.

The inputs in question here, supervisory intensity and

workers' wages, are observed. The output of workers is not directly observed.
Table 5 assumes that firm output is correlated with firm sales. This is a noisy

measure of the relevant output, and is available only for a subset of firms.

Table 5 shows regressions of sales on supervisory intensity, the average wage
of non—supervisory employees, total employment and the set of dichotomous variables for industry and area.

Neither higher wages nor more supervisors per

worker are significantly associated with greater sales conditional on total
employment.

6. Turnover and Wage Premiums
In its short history, efficiency wage theory has quickly spawned a number

of different varieties. Now I turn from the shirking version to the turnover
version.

The hypothesis is that wage bonuses are profitably paid to reduce

costly turnover. This section investigates whether turnover is lower in high
wage firms, whether this can explain much of the observed wage dispersion, and
whether the wage bonuses are efficient in the sense that they pay for themselves

through reductions in turnover.

For each of 200 plants I observe the total number of separations -among
non—exempt (non—managerial) employees over the previous 6 months, along with
total employment of non—exempt employees at the beginning (March 1982) of this
6—month period.

I calculate the mean wage paid by each firm to non—exempt em—

-

13

ployees by weighting mean firm wages for detailed non—exempt occupations by
employment share of each occupation in each firm.

Separations include quits,

fires, and retirements, but should not include temporary layoffs.
nately, I

Unfortu-

subtract out the retirements, but this is a small proportion

of all separations. The turnover rate for each firm is calculated as the ratio

(for non—exempt workers) of total separations over the previous 6 months to
total employment at the beginning of that period. Turnover averages 25% per
half year in the firms sampled here.9
The turnover version of the efficiency wage model predicts that higher wages

cause lower turnover, and more distinctively that wage premiums increase until

the point that marginal reductions in turnover do not add to profits. Table 6
presents the results of regressions of turnover rates on wages for 200 firms.
Column 1 presents an unadorned simple regression. Column 2 presents a multiple

regression with controls for total employment, occupational composition, industry and area. These additional controls reduce the wage effect on turnover
by 14%.

In both cases, the first prediction of the efficiency wage model is

borne out: higher wages are associated with lower turnover, and the result is
statistically significant. But note that a number of other models predict the
same result.

In particular, a model of accidents predicts this.

A smaller

proportion of workers is expected to quit at any firm that accidentally pays
higher wages.

The important questions are 1) whether this association is strong enough
to explain a substantial part of wage variation across firms, 2) whether it is
profitable.

In both cases, the answer appears to be no.

In the first case,

while there is considerable variation in both turnover and wages, the former
is not highly enough correlated with the latter to account for its variation.

14

The second question can be addressed by asking how high the marginal cost

of turnover would have to be to justify the observed wage premiums. Suppose,

as in the first equation of Table 6, that an additional dollar of 'wages per
worker per hour reduces turnover by 3.6 percentage points per worker per half—
year. For convenience, think of this as a 3.6 percentage point decrease in the

probability that the representative worker turns over per half—year. Assuming

a 2080 (52x40) hour work year, this result is achieved at a marginal cost of
$2080 per worker—year. For a risk neutral firm, this is profitable only if the

marginal cost of turnover exceeds $57,777.

Because the wage bonus effect on

turnover is small, payment of such bonuses only profitably reduce turnover if
the benefits of actual turnover reduction exceeded 28 times the cost.

In view

of the fact that workers in this sample average an annual pay of $15,500, such
exorbitant turnover expenses may be ruled out.

Higher wages are associatedwith lower turnover, as the efficiency wage
model (among others) predicts, but the reduction in turnover achieved by such

wages premiums hardly justifies the payment of observed wage premiums as a
profit maximizing act.1°

7. Conclusion
The shirking version of the efficiency wage model makes a strong prediction

that self—supervision is a substitute in production for external supervision.
This paper tests for evidence of a trade—off between wage premiums and supervisory intensity. While all of the tests presented here are subject to serious

qualification, little evidence is found to support the hypothesis. There is
little evidence that the considerable differences in occupational wages paid
across firms can be accounted for by the shirking model.

15

This paper has shown that there are large differentials in wages paid within

narrow occupations between plants in the high—technology sector of a single
state. Take the very narrowness of the occupational definitions used as a good

control for unobserved worker quality. Assume that the concentration of employees in one industry in one state controls for much of unobserved location,

union threat, or industry effects. Under these assumptions, the results here
of wide wage dispersion across firms remains a puzzle from the perspective of
both of the competing theories.
The turnover version of the efficiency wage model predicts that wage bonuses

are paid up to the point at which further reductions in turnover cease adding
to profits. This paper presents evidence that higher wages are indeed associ-

ated with lower turnover rates, but that the reductions in turnover achieved
are not sufficient to establish the profitability of wage bonuses.

Wages for narrowly defined occupations within one sector of one state are

widely dispersed. Neither the shirking nor the turnover variants of the efficiency wage model appear able to explain this dispersion. The task that remains

for contemporary wage theory is to provide evidence supporting an explanation
for this observed wage dispersion.

Xrueger (1987) and Levine

(1987).

2. Part—time employees who regularly work over 20 hours per week and are eligible for pro—rated normal benefits are reported at their full—time equiv-

alents. Temporary or seasonal employees are excluded unless they are paid
as are full—time regular employees. Those on job—shop rates are excluded.

3.

For some occupations, two or more levels of the job are reported, for example Field Service "B" and Field Service "A'.

In such cases I take the

total of employment in each of the subclassifications, and the weighted
average of pay.

4. Where more than one level of supervision is reported, I take the sum of
employment and the weighted average of pay.

5. It is not clear that firms have an incentive to act strategically in reporting wages. Any individual response has a negligible effect on reported

averages. In addition, a firm may cause comparable damage to a competitor

by fooling it into paying wages above market as by fooling it into below
market wages. Given the high level of "trading" in this concentrated market, market price is a difficult secret to keep.

6. The analysis in Table 3 excludes firms that report zero supervisors in the

sample. This has no effect of note on the results.

17

7. There is also no evidence of a size—wage effect, at this detailed level of
analysis, with size measured as number of employees within

a given occupa-

tional group.

8. Table 4 also shows no significant scale, industry or area effects on the
supervisor—to—worker ratio, although there are differences in this ratio
across occupations.

It ranges from 0 to 1.7. The mean wage of non—exempt workers in these firms

is $7.45, ranging from $4.99 to $11.13.

The firms in this sample average

144 non—exempt employees, ranging from 3 to 2,444. Both the turnover rate

and the mean wage of non—exempt employees vary across firms because of
changes in the occupational composition of the non—exempt work force.

In

the analysis that follows, I control for each firm's occupational composi-

tion by including control variables giving the proportion of each firm's
non—exempt employment in each of 7 occupational groups. The average wage

here, conditional on this broad occupational distribution, may not pre-

cisely capture the wage bonuses within detailed occupations relevant to
efficiency wage models.

10. Table 6 also contains other results of interest. Some have theorized that

turnover is a greater problem at large plants because of a greater sense
of alienation. Here, I observe lower turnover rates at larger plants, although the effect is small and insignificant. Design and drafting

workers,

and operative have (insignificantly) higher turnover rates than do elec-

tronic technicians. Across industries, turnover rates are significantly
higher in computer equipment, medical equipment, and electronic instru—

18

ments, by 14 to 20 percentage points.

Obviously, other factors besides

wages (such as promotion prospects, or quaLity of supervision) are of im-

portance in exp1ainng turnover.
