       Over the past 25 years most developed countries have adopted same form of a Value

Added Tax (VAT). Moreover, these taxes have become important sources of revenue in many

of those countries'. The arguments on its behalf are well known. A VAT can raise significant

amounts of revenue. The Congressional Budget Office (1993) estimates that a broad based VAT

imposed at a 5% rate in the United States beginning in 1995 could raise close to $70 billion in

its first year. Even after exempting food, housing, and medical care, the VAT would still raise

roughly $36 billion in its first year. In addition, a VAT does not distort current and future

consumption decisions. Put differently, the returns to saving are untaxed - a feature that has

made consumption taxes like a VAT attractive to policy makers concerned with the level of

savings in (he United States2.

        Despite these facts and despite a number of efforts to introduce a VAT in this country,

the United States does not employ a VAT. There are two important reasons for this. First,

many are suspicious that a VAT would be a "money machine". That is, it would be a "hidden'




     In 1986 West Germany raised 14% of its total tax revenue from a VAT while the United
Kingdom raised 18% and Denmark 27% (Tait (1988)).

    2 It has also been argued (incorrectly) that a VAT would help improve the trade balance.
With appropriate border adjustments, a VAT is neutral with respect to trade (see Grossman
(1980)). A VAT could encourage net exports if it was used to reduce the reliance on direct
taxes of which some of the burden might be passed forward to consumers and result in higher
export prices.
tax raising large sums of money and would ease pressure on Congress and the President to

reduce federal spending. Second, others view the VAT as a highly regressive tax.3

       This paper takes up the second question - whether a value added tax would in fact be

regressive. Viewed in the context of a single year, a VAT does in fact look quite regressive.

However, when viewed in the context of a taxpayer's lifetime, a VAT looks decidedly less

regressive and in fact can look quite progressive under different design schemes. In the next

section I review the literature on the incidence of consumption taxes and discuss the importance

of the lifetime perspective. Section III presents the essential results of the paper. Using the

1990 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), I estimate the incidence of a VAT using annuai

income and current consumption as my two income measures. Here I find that a broad based

VAT looks essentially proportional when a taxpayer's resources over her lifetime are considered.

I then consider how bequests affect this result. Over the lifetime the present discounted value

of labor earnings must equal the present discounted value of consumption plus net bequests given

(net of bequests received). It is by no means clear how a broad based consumption tax would

affect the value of bequests even if they are not directly taxed. I consider one extreme scenario:

that bequests given are not subject to nor affected by a value added tax. Accounting for

bequests in this fashion does not affect the central finding of proportionality in any significant

way.



       In addition, there are fears that a VAT would be inflationary, that it would hinder state
and local governments' ability to raise money through sales taxes, and that it would be difficult
to administer. It is by no means clear why a one time price increase would fuel inflation. As
for the other two concerns, these are design considerations that would need to be addressed if
a VAT were implemented. Note though that a VAT with a state revenue sharing component
could reduce sales tax tensions of the type currently taking place between New York and Nçw
Jersey (New York Times (Dec. 9, 1992)).

                                                2
       Section IV considers various ways to increase the progressivity of a VAT. I find that

a VAT could be easily modified in ways that would substantially increase the progressivity of

the tax. Section V concludes.

                                II. Consumption Tax Burdens

       As is well known, the statutory incidence of a tax can differ markedly from its economic

incidence. Despite the number of ways in which a VAT can be administered, the tax is

generally considered to be a tax on consumption.4 The final incidence of a tax will depend on

whether it is passed forward (economic incidence on consumers), backwards (economic

incidence on factors of production - capital and labor), or some combination of forward and

backward shifting. Early studies (e.g. Musgrave, Case, and Leonard (1974) and Pechman

(1985)) take the results from a wide number of empirical studies to make judgements about the

appropriate shifting of individual taxes and typically conclude that consumption taxes are passed

forward to and borne by consumers in proportion to their expenditures.         In these studies,

families are ranked according to their annual income and average tax shares by decile or quintile

are computed. These studies find that average tax rates for existing consumption taxesin the

 United States (federal excise taxes, state and local sales and excise taxes) fall with income:

 consumption taxes are regressive.

        As an alternative to the approach used by Pechman and others, Ballard, Scholz, and

 Shoven (1987) used a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model which allows for relative

 prices to change in response to changes in tax systems to study a VAT. Theyestimate that a




      See Congressional Budget Office (1992) for a good discussion of the ways in which a
 VAT could be administered.

                                                3
VAT introduced as a partial substitute for the persona] income tax would produce welfare losses

for lower income groups and welfare gains for higher income groups. Such a shift in taxation

would be regressive.3

       Recently, there has been considerable interest in measuring the lifetime incidence of

consumption taxes. There are two reasons for this interest. First, annual income can fluctuate

substantially. Given people's ability to save and spend out of accumulated savings, annual

income may not be a good measure of an individual's ability to consume in a given year.

Friedman (1957) formalized this notion in his Permanent Income Hypothesis (FIR) arguing that

people make consumption decisions based on an unobservable measure of permanent income.

If the purpose of a distributional analysis is to group and rank people by a measure of their

economic welfare, permanent income is probably a better measure than annual income for

ranking people. Fluctuations in annual income will tend to make a consumption tax look more

regressive than it would be if we could measure and rank people by permanent income.

Someone with a positive shock to income (e.g. winning the lottery) will appear "rich" and have

a low consumption to income ratio (and hence a low consumption tax to income ratio) while

someone with a negative shock (e.g. experiencing a temporary spell of unemployment) will

appear "poor" and have a high consumption to income ratio.

       Second. life cycle considerations suggest that we should view individuals by their lifetime

income (viz Modigliani and Brumberg (1954)), People tend to earn low amounts of income




      Pechman assumes that the system of sales and excise taces in the U.S. would be replaced
by a lump sum tax. The regressivity of the tax shift in Ballard, Scholz, and Shoven is partially
due to the use of a VAT and partially due to the decreased reliance on the income tax with its
progressive rate schedule.

                                               4
(relative to their average income over their lifetime) in early parts of their lives as well as in old

age. in a cross sectional analysis, lower income groups will include not only poor people (in

a lifetime sense) but also young and old people who are not poor in a lifetime sense but are

making consumption decisions based on their future ability to earn or on their past earning

history. The difficulties with measuring income at the low end of the distribution are well

understood by economists6.

        Recognizing the difficulties with using annual income as a measure of ability to pay,

economists have conducted distributional analyses using life-cycle models in which a measure

of lifetime income is used to rank households. The challenge in this approach is to measure the

unobservable variable lifetime income: the present discounted value of earned income plus gifts

received. Lifetime income (iV) can be measured in one of two ways. As equation (I) shows,

we can measure W on the sources or uses side:


                                                 '—'
                                                E+G i-F C÷B I
                                                                                                 (1)
                                         t-C0          Io



On the sources side, lifetime income is the present discounted value of earned income (E) and

bequests received (G) while on the uses side, it equals the present discounted value of

 consumption (C) and bequests made (B).

         Poterba (1989, 1991) has proposed using a measure of consumption as a proxy for

 lifetime income in studies of federal excise taxes. Under the assumption that consumption tends


    6 Pechman resolved this measurement problem by discarding the lowest 5 percent of the
 families in the income distribution from his sample.

                                                   5
to be smoother than income, total annual consumption is likely to be a better measure of well-

being than is annual income. This approach measures lifetime income from the uses side.

Metcalf (1993) has used a similar approach to analyze state and local tax systems. In general,

these studies find that consumption taxes are less regressive with a lifecycle perspective than

when an annual perspective is employed.

       Fullerton and Rogers (1993) have conducted an extensive study of lifetime incidence of

the U.S. tax system; in effect,   they've "redone" Pechman in a lifetime setting. The authors

construct a measure of lifetime income by estimating age-income profiles for different

demographic groups. This is used to impute a stream of wage rates from which their lifetime

income can be constructed: they measure lifetime income on the sources side.' Fullerton and

Rogers find that the system of federal, state, and local sales and excise taxes in the United States

is roughly as regressive in a lifecycle perspective as in an annual perspective. This finding

cannot be easiiy carried over to a VAT. The tax rates facing consumers in their study range

widely from 0 (housing) to 79% (tobacco). Much of the regressivity is due to the fact that

necessities tend to be taxed at higher ntes than are luxury good?. Presumably, a VAT would

be structured differently.

       Policy makers may be apprehensive about an approach that must make heroic assumptions

about future income and consumption streams to assess the distributional impact of a




      They estimate wage profiles rather than earned income profiles in order to include leisure
as a consumption good.

        Fullerton and Rogers' results are also somewhat sensitive to their use of a Stone-Geary
utility function. Varying the minimum required purchase has a large effect on the measured
regressivity of consumption taxes.

                                                 6
consumption tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) (1993) recently has considered this

issue and proposed using a five year window to approximate lifetime income. This approach

probably deals best with the problem of transitory fluctuations to income but does not capture

life cycle considerations very well. The ICr found that nearly 90% of theobservations in their

study were in a five year average income decile that was within one decile of their annual

income decile. They conclude that single year income measures are reasonably good measures

for permanent income (p. 86). This finding contrasts sharply with Fullerton and Rogers'

analysis, however, in which they find that less than half (46%) of the individuals in their sample

are in a lifetime income decile within one decile of their annual income decile. Fullerton and

Rogers' finding indicates that a five year income measure may not be a good proxy for lifetime

income and that analyses based on lifetime income measures may give substantially different

 results than analyses based on annual income measures.

                                 II!. The Distribution of a VAT

        in this section, 1 consider the distribution of a 5% value added tax introduced as an

 additional tax with no change in government expenditures using data from the 1990 Consumer

 Expenditure Survey.9 I will assume that the burden of a VAT is borne by consumers and

 compute the tax burden as the statutory rate multiplied by the dollar amount of consumptionJ°




                                                                     what is done with the revenue
       This is an absolute incidence experiment. I do not consider
 raised by the tax.

      '° In latter parts of the paper, I consider deductions as well as lump sum subsidies. Most
 VATs are administered by the invoice method in which the tax is paid at each stage of
                                                                             stages. From the
 manufacture on total value with a credit allowed for taxes paid at previous
                                                            to implementing a VAT as a retail
 viewpoint of determining the tax burden, this is equivalent
 sales tax at the national level.
                                                 7
The forward shifting assumption is consistent with previous work by Pechman (1985),

Musgrave, Case, and Leonard (1974) and others. In addition, I will measure taxes at the

household level.

        Data for the analysis come from the 1990 CEX family expenditure files. The CEX

interviews families once every three months for 5 quarters. Information from the second

through fifth interviews is publicly available and can be used to construct estimates of annual

consumption'. New households enter the sample every quarter and depart after their fifth

interview. Families interviewed in a given quarter are asked about consumption over the last

three months. Because families may be interviewed at any date within the quarter, data from

the previous three month period can be included in the current quarter. Thus, families

interviewed in the first quarter of 1990 may report some expenditures from the last quarter of

1989. Similarly, families interviewed in the first quarter of 1991 may report expenditures from

1990.   1 use families who report complete income information, are interviewed for all four

quarters (that are publicly released), and who enter the sample in either the first or second

quarter of 1990. This gives me 1561 observations for my sample.

        To compare annual and lifetime measures, I will use annual before tax income for the

annual measure and current consumption as a measure of lifetime income. The before tax

income measure comes from the 1990 CEX.            I construct current consumption as total

expenditures (as reported in the CEX) less new vehicle purchases, housing costs for

homeowners, and contributions for pensions and life insurance. These deductions are in large

part a form of saving. To measure the consumption component of housing and automobiles, I



        There is also a diary component to the study. I do not use this part of the CEX.

                                              8
include an imputed rental value for owner occupied housing (reported in the CEX) and impute

an automobile consumption value using an approach of Cutler and Katz (199 l).12

       Table 1 provides summary statistics on current consumption and income for my sample

while table 2 presents the cutoff values for each decile. Mean income at $34,794 is substantially

higher than mean current consumption at $27,780 (ignore the last column for now). The skew

in income is apparent: mean income is 25% greater than the median while mean consumption

is only 15% greater than median consumption. Income is also more variable. The coefficient

of variation for the income measure is .75 while only .58 for current consumption. Note also

that annual income less current consumption is negative for the lowest three deciles and increases

monotonically with consumption (or income). Presumably, consumption exceeds income for

many in the lowest deciles because annual income for many of these households has been

reduced by an income shock that is not expected to persist over time.

       Table 3 provides a tabulation of current consumption against income. Roughly 9% of

the households in the lowest income decile have current consumption above median consumption

in the sample. In addition, 36% of the households are in a consumption decile at least two

deciles away from their income decile. This dispersion of consumption within income decites

should make one cautious about using income as a measure of well being.

       Another way to see the difficulties associated with using annual income in an incidence

analysis is depicted in figure 1. I computed the median ratio of total expenditures to before tax

income by age of head of household and graphed this variable against age. As the lifecycle




     12 See the appendix for details on the construction of automobile consumption. For renters,
I include their rent payment.

                                                9
model predicts, all but one of the observations where the median ratio exceeds one are for ages

below 25 and above 60. In addition, I regressed this ratio against age, age squared, and age

cubed.'3 Figure 1 also shows the graph of the predicted ratio against age. The graph has

peaks at age 18 and 78, once again suggesting that the young and the old are making expenditure

decisions taking variables other than current income into account.

       One problem with the consumption measure described above is that it does not include

bequests. Lifetime income on the uses side consists of consumption plus bequests given. As

Menchik and David (1982) have noted, a VAT would likely exempt bequests from taxation.

How one should think about bequests when constructing a VAT is not entirely clear. Bequest

behavior can be categorized in the following ways: accidental, altruistic, 'warm glow", and

strategic bequests. Bemheim (1987) finds little support for either accidental or altruistic

bequests'4. One can reasonably think of "warm glow" and strategic bequests as a form of

consumption that should be taxed. To the extent that the bequest is worth less to the recipient

(since it will be taxed upon consumption), the bequest is also worth less to the donor. Put

differently, one could argue that these forms of bequests are in fact taxed by a VAT.

       Rather than argue that a VAT does in fact tax bequests, I proceed by providing an

alternative measure of current consumption which includes an annualized value of bequests. In



     " I also ran the regression with age raised to the fourth. The t statistic on this variable was
I. 1. The graph of predicted expenditures to income against age looks very similar to the graph
using a cubic polynomial.

    ' It is not clear how one would think about these forms of bequests with a VAT. If
bequests are accidental, should one consider these either as lifetime income or as a form of
untaxed consumption? If bequests are due to altruism, one must reconsider the lifetime approach
to measuring tax incidence. Altruism suggests that the lifetime of a dynasty is the appropriate
measure rather than the lifetime of a member of the dynasty.

                                                                   the distributional effects of the
whether including bequests as part of the income measure affects

tax. To understand the importance of bequests, consider equation (2) below which rewrites the

uses side of the lifetime income definition:

                                                                                               (2)

                                                                            discounted value
where B is the present discounted value of bequests given and C the present
of consumption. Current consumption can serve as a proxy for C; my tax base is misspecified

by ignoring B. To add bequests to the tax base, I rely on work by Menchik and David (1982).

The first column of table 4 reproduces table 4 of their article. Using an extensive data set on

income tax returns and probate records, they construct an estimate of the ratio of bequests to

lifetime income. Let 4) represent this ratio.

                                                                                                ()

 We can also think of 4) as the ratio of annualized bequests to the sum of annualized bequests and

 current consumption. Equation (3) can be rewritten in terms of annualized bequests and current

 consumption as

The second column of table 4 reports the ratio l/(l-). This ratio serves as an adjuster to

measure true lifetime income on an annual basis. Bequests as a ratio of income are U shaped

with a trough at aboutthe 80th percentile. Current consumption is increased by 30% in the

lowest decile with the adjustment falling to 8.5% in the 8th decile. It then rises sharply with

bequests increasing current consumption by 20% in the top decile'5.

           The last column of table 1 provides summary statistics on the bequest adjusted

consumption variable. Mean (median) consumption is now roughly $4,000 ($2,500) higher than

when bequests are ignore&6. Table 5 presents distributional results for a 5% VAT tax on total

      IS
            may be surprising that the bequest to lifetime income ratio is not monotonic in income.
However, there is no reason to believe that it should be. A monotonically increasing
relationship implies that the elasticity of bequests with respect to lifetime income is greater than
one. While various theories of bequests can help explain why the elasticity should be positive,
no theory requires that bequests be a luxury good.

       Kotlikoff (1988) estimates reported transfers of $45.5 billion in 1974 or 3.1% of GD?.
Grossing this number up to 1990 using the 1990 GD? yields a per capita value of transfers of
$689. Assuming 2.7 people per household (1990 value) yields an estimate of $1,860 in annual

adjusted current consumption. Households are

allocated to deciles'7. The avenge VAT tax rate is computed for each household and the

median is identified within each decile. Using annual income to rank households leads to a VAT

looking distinctly regressive. Median tax rates fall from 7.1% in the lowest decile to 3.2% in

the highest decile. However, the story dramatically changes when current consumption is used

to rank households and construct tax rates. Now, the lowest decile faces a median tax rate of

5.0% while the highest decile faces a median rate of 5.1 %. Furthermore, there is no distinct

pattern to rates moving from the lowest to highest decile. This pattern is very similar to results

shown in Caspersen and Metcalf (1993) using the 1988 CEX.'8 Adjusting consumption for

bequests (but not subjecting bequests to a VAT) does not alter the results very much. Median

tax rates fall by about 1.2% at the bottom and 0.8% at the top of the distribution while falling

about 0.4% iji the 7th and 8th deciles. It does not appear that excluding bequests in the

 construction of a proxy for permanent income affects the results significantly.

        The results in table S suggest that a broad based VAT would be roughly proportional if

 viewed over the lifecycle. So far I have not considered variations on the basic VAT to alter its

 progressivity. In the next section, 1 take up this subject, first considering reasonable categories

 of expenditures that would not be subject to a VAT and then variations on a VAT.




                                                                                     them into
      17 For households in a few deciles, adjusting consumption for bequests may move
 a different decile. I use an iterative procedure to correct for this problem.

                             IV. Altering A VAT's Distribution

       Few countries subject all expenditures to a value added tax. Of the 21 countries surveyed


by Ernst and Young    in 1991, 15 apply a lower or a zero rate to basic foodstuffs while 20

partially or fully exempt health services.'9 Housing is more complicated. In general, most

VAT countries do not tax residential shelter.2° If the United States were to adopt a value added

tax, these three categories of consumption - food, shelter and medical care - would be likely

candidates for special treatment. Table 6 presents distributional results for a VAT which zero

rated these three categories of consumption. Two pictures emerge from this table. First,

removing these three classes of consumption from a VAT would substantially diminish the

revenue potential of a VAT.2' Second, the tax becomes substantially more progressive. Using

annual income as a base, average tax rates are nearly constant across the income distribution,

rising from 1.65% at the low end to 1.77% in the middle before falling back to 1.65% at the

top of the distribution. Using current consumption as a proxy for permanent income, the tax

looks decidedly progressive. The top decile median avenge tax rate is 2.3 times as large as the

corresponding tax rate for the first decile. Adjusting consumption for bequests reduces median

average tax rates for all deciles with the largest change occurring at the bottom and top of the

distribution. The top rate is now 2.4 times as large as the bottom rate.


     Only New Zealand subjects health services to a VAT. See Appendix A of Ernst and
Young (1991) r details.

    20 See Tait (1988) for a general description of the treatment of housing. In the United
Kingdom, the treatment of real property changed after the defeat of the UK in a court case
brought against the European Commission in the European Court of Justice. As a result of that
decision1 zero-rating of buildings is largely confined to residential and charitable properties.

    11 The Congressional Budget Office (1993) estimates that zero rating these three categories
would halve the tax revenue from a VAT.

                                              14
       Recently, Lester Thurow (1993) argued that a VAT could be made substantially more
                                                                       A family of 4 would
progressive by allowing an exemption of $4,000 in spending per person.

be able to exempt the first $16,000 in spending from a VAT. With a 5% VAT, this would

reduce their tax liability by $800. To capture the flavor of this proposal, I consider a VAT with
                                                                                    to raise
a $1,000 refundable credit per household combined with a VAT. I adjust the tax rate

the same amount of revenue as a 5% VAT without the credit. Table 7 reports distributional

results where current consumption is used as a proxy for lifetime income. If total expenditures

are taxable, the VAT rate becomes 8.5% while if food, shelter, and health care are excluded,
the rate becomes 10.3%. VAT burdens as a share of lifetime income are now markedly

progressive. If total expenditures are taxed, the median average tax rate in the lowest decile is

now negative: these households tend to pay less than $1,000 in VAT. The average tax rate
                                                                                         rises

                                                                              food, shelter,
sharply by decile with the rate in the top decile now exceeding 7%. Excluding

and medical care leads to a subsidy for the median taxpayer in the bottom 3 deciles. The top

 rate now is 5.8%.

        Another way to think about the distributional effects of a VAT with a $1,000 household

 credit is to consider what rate structure on a consumed income tax would raise the same revenue

 and maintain the same Suits Index as does the VAT with credit. I considered a three rate

 consumed income tax where total expenditures are subject to a graduated rate structurewith

 breakpoints at the 25d' and 75 percentiles. We can preserve revenue and the Suits Index with

 a rate structure of 2.0, 6.5%, and 11.9% when current consumption is used to measure people's

 economic well-being. To duplicate the effects of a VAT with credit and exclusions for food.

 shelter, and medical care, rates of 0%, 4.2%, and 12.4% will suffice if total expenditures are



                                                15
the base of the tax. Table 8 reports median average tax rates (with current consumption in

the base) for these consumed income taxes. For the tax that is equivalent to a VAT on total

expenditures the bottom tax rate was set to zero and the middle and top rate were set to raise

the same amount of revenue and preserve the Suits Index value, conditional on the marginal

rates increasing with income. It is not possible to construct a set of tax rates that satisfy the

above conditions with the lowest rate being zero. The lowest value I can set the bottom rate is

2.0% and meet the required conditions. Once various expenditures are excluded from the VAT

it becomes possible to set the rate on the lowest bracket equal to zero.

       There are two basic messages in these results. First, the conventional wisdom that a

value added tax is regressive is not correct when a lifetime perspective is used. Second, there

are relatively easy ways to modify a VAT to increase its progressivity (in either the annual or

lifetime perspective).

                                         V. Conclusion

       A value added tax is viewed as being a regressive tax and has been opposed by many for

its impact on the poor. This paper has argued that when "rich" and "poor" are properly

measured, a VAT may not burden the poor substantially more than it would the rich. When a

lifetime perspective is taken, a VAT on total expenditures is roughly proportional. In addition,

various modifications of a VAT could substantially increase the progressivity of the tax. In this

paper I have considered household credits as well as the exclusion of various spending categories




        The Suits Index for a VAT on total expenditures with a $1,000 household credit is 0.243.
If food, shelter, and health expenditures are zero rated, the Suits Index rises to 0.433.

                                               16
from the tax base. The effect of these modifications on the distribution of a VAT can be quite

substantial, with the VAT now looking quite progressive.

         In closing, let me note that the results discussed above are steady-state results assuming

households are subject to a VAT for their entire lives. The transitory incidence of a VAT would

be substantial and is likely to be of considerable interest to policy makers. Imposing a VAT

today would lead to a substantial shift in taxes to current owners of capital, many of whom are

elderly. An alternative way to impose a consumption tax like a VAT is via a wage tax23.

While the steady state effects of a wage tax and a comprehensive VAT would be equivalent, a

wage tax would exempt current owners of capital from the consumption tax in the transition.

         From a policy making perspective, it may be more attractive to impose a wage tax than

a VAT and thereby avoid imposing a transitional burden on the current elderly (and other capital

owners). However, the wage tax approach comes with an efficiency cost. A VAT can be

viewed as a wage tax with a one time lump sum tax on existing capital. The lump sum nature

of the tax reduces the deadweight loss associated with the imposition of the consumption tax.

Moreover, the welfare gains resulting from the lump sum component of the VAT can be

substantial24.




   23 Referring back to equation (1), a wage tax is levied on the sources side of the lifetime
budget constraint while a VAT is levied on the uses side.
    24
        Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and Skinner (1983) have demonstrated in a large scale simulation
model that imposing a consumption tax generates efficiency gains over a wage tax on the order
of 4% of lifetime resources.

                           Al. Imputing Annual Vehicle Consumption
          My approach to constructing an annual measure of vehicle consumption follows Cutler

and Katz (1991). I begin by running a regression of spending per vehicle on household

characteristics for those households which reported the purchase of at least one vehicle?5 The

regression is reported in Table Al at the end
                                              of the paper. Spending on vehicles goes up with

age, other expenditures (over the plausible range of the sample), and aftertax income. Spending

is also higher for smaller families, and families with male or
                                                               non-white heads of households.

This regression is used to impute the value of a new car that each household would purchase if
                                                                                over an 8 year
they purchased a car that year. I then assume that cars depreciate straightline

period and use that value as the consumption value per vehicle in the household. Finally, 1
                                                 vehicles owned by the household.
multiply this consumption value by the number of




     2$
        From the quarterly CEX data, I can construct an estimate of how many cars were
 purchased over the course of the year.

   This table presents a tabulation of annual income against current consumption from the
1990 Consumer Expenditure Survey. Cell entries are the probability of being in a
consumption decile conditional on being in a given income decile. Consumption is net of
expenditures on automobiles and housing and inclusive of rental equivalents for those
durables. Pension and life insurance contributions are also excluded. There are 1561
observations in the data set.

This table reports median tax rates from a consumed income tax by consumption decile. The
tax liability per household is computed 1mm a progressive rate schedule on a tax base of total
expenditures in the 1990 CEX. Individual avenge tax rates are computed as the ratio of tax
liability to current consumption. Households are sorted by consumption and the median tax
rate within each decile reported. There are 1561 observations in the data set. Marginal tax
rates are chosen to raise the same amount of revenue as the VAT in table 7 and have an
equivalent value for the Suits Index.
