Intertemporal Substitution in Consumption

ABS TPJC T

Does a higher real interest rate induce significant post-

ponement of consumption? According to the theory developed
here, this question can be answered by studying the relation
between the rate of growth of consumption and expected real

interest rates. In postwar data for the United States, expected
real returns have declined over time in the stock market and for

savings accounts. Over the same period, the rate of growth of
consumption has been almost steady. The paper concludes that
intertemporal substitution is weak, for if it were strong, the
growth rate of consumption would have declined.

rest on the intertemporal substitutability of consumption.
In contrast to most recent research, this paper attempts to

estimate parameters of the representative individual's utility

funrtion, rather than arameters of the consumption function or

savings function. As Pohert Lucas (1976) has pointed out, there
may not he anything that could properly he called a consumption

and interest rates depends on the wider macroeconomic context

maqnitue of the response of consumption to a change in real

model where the assumptions are formalize and the estimation
techniques rqorouslv justified.
Over the postwar period, there has been a downward shift in
the expected real return from common stocks and savings

For the nurposes of what follows, it

is

not necessary to make

specific assumptions about the market setting of the

ximizatjon. At one extreme, the consumer could face a full
set of markets in contingent commodities, and then the budget
constraint would say that the sum of all the consumer's demands
for the continqent claims valued at market prices would equal

his endowment. At the other extreme, the consumer could he

Then the budget constraint would

In any case, one of the many choices facing the consumer is to

soend the stochastic proceeds in year t. Suppose that a unit

Further progress in translating the reallocation condition

The stronq testahl.e implication of the theory is that the mean

of the marqinal rate of substitution is shifted only by the mean
of i-he real interest rate. Information available in year t—l is

helpful n prei5ctinq the marginal rate of substitution only to
the extent that it nredicts the real interest rate. This
testahi.e implication is the )oqical extension of the one derived
in my earlier paper under

constancy

of real interest rates. In

that case, rio variahie known in year t—i should help predict the

marqina rate of substitution.
The next step in deriving testable implications is to assume a
functional form for the utility function. .Breeden has suggested

Here s is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the

reciprocal of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. In the
next section, a more elaborate specification is introduced where
separate oarameters control intertemporal substitution and risk

aversion. I show that the procedure developed here for the
simple additive utility function actually estimates the
intertemporal. elasticity of substitution. The hivariate

2. flistinj±n intertemnorral substitution from risk aversion

In this section, I wiLl argue that the regression of the rate
of change of consumption on the expected real interest rate
reveals the intertempor]. elasticity of substitution, not the

coefficient of relative risk aversion. In order to infer
anvt-.hnq about risk aversion, more than one asset must he

considered. The argument proceeds by introducing a utility
function

where separate parameters control risk aversion and

intertempora]. substitution. Consumer optimization gives rise to
exactly the same hivariate model of real returns and the change

in consumption derived in the previous section. The risk
aversion Parameter is not identified econometrically from the
data on the return to a sinqle asset and the rate of change of
consumot ion.

The utility function is the earlier function raised to a

I define the intertempora] elasticity of substitution as the

elasticity of substitution between consumption in any pair of

years under certainty; this is plainly the parameter, s. On the

other hand, I define the coefficient of relative risk aversion
according to its standard atemporal definition applied to the
utility function obtained by inserting a common stochastic level

of

consurnDtion in every year into the function just given. This

is easily seen to he the parameter a. I assume that s is less
than one and a exceeds one.

To

complete the mor9el it is necessary to relate the

conr94tional mean of the real interest rate, r, to observed

variahl.es known to consumers at the time that they choose

Recall, that r is the mean of the subjective distribution for
the real

interest

rate held by the typical consumer at the time

consumption decisions are made for year t—l.

What I will call

the "conventional specification" for expectations has been
emoloyed frequently in macroeconomic models derived, from

rational expectations and, in particular, underlies the recent
work of Lars Hansen and Kenneth Singleton (1981) on consumption.
The conventional specification says that the mean of the
subjective distribution is a linear combination of observed
variables:

(3.1)

r = xt_ih

anr the coefficients, h, are known in advance. Under this
srecification, the complete model of expectations and

—14--

consumption becomes a simple application of bivariate regression
with parameter constraints across the equations.
The conventional approach to the characterization of
expectations relies on the implicit assumption that the public
has always known the coefficients, h, of the forecasting

equation for the real interest rate. The least—squares estimate
of h embodies information that was not actually available to
consumers, because it comes from a regression with later data.

The fitted value, xih, cannot really claim to he the mean of
the subjective distrihuti.on at t—l because it draws on

information unavailbie in year t—l. As a practical matter, the

problem is apparent in the following way: The

xt_h, is much

too

fitted

value,

good a predictor of actual real interest

rates, especially rates derived from the stock market. The
fitted values fluctuate far too much to interpret them as truly
the means of the subjective distributions held by the typical
consumer.

A more satisfactory alternative is a formal Bayesian
characterization of the subjective distribution of the real

interest rate. In this view, consumers begin the sample period
with a prior distribution on the parameters of the subjective

distribution of the real interest rate. As each year passes,
they update their subjective distributions to form a suitable
posterior distribution, which then plays the role of the
sublective distribution of the prospective real interest rate.

Within the framework of a model in the form

and the theory of consumption developed earlier

continues to aTDtily. The mean of r from this type of model is

much hetter behaved than is the fitted value from a regression.

effect) ,

I

wfll assume that the variances of the surprises

arid Vt, are known in advance. In year t—l, the consumer and the
econornetrician have a record extending from 1 to t—l. The
consumer wants to infer the mean, ht_i, of the posterior

distribution of the coefficients governing the real return. If
the surprise in consumption were uncorrelated with the surprise
in the real. return, the problem would he a straightforward one

of univariate Bayesian regression. Suppose that the consumer
started with a prior distribution on b with mean b and precision

This number then becomes data for re—restirnation next year and

The following intuitive summary of the econometric procedure
wflJ

provide

a reasonably accurate guide: For each year, run a

regression using data available only up to that year to estimate

the parameters, h. Include the consumer's prior beliefs held at
the beginning of the period in this regression. Compute the
fitted value from the regression and call it rt. This process

wfll yield a complete time series for r*. The very last
regression will also provide the econometrician's best

—18—

-9escriotion of information about both the process generating

real returns and the response of consumption, provided that the
econometrjcian also holds the same Drior beliefs as the
consumer.

Because the econometrician usually presents just

the

sample

evidence, not the osterior distribution incorporting prior
beliefs,

it

is

also

useful to re—estimate at the end

with

conventional hivariate regression, but using the same series for

r*

.

The re—estiiation gives sample evidence conditional on the

va'idity of the characterization of the prior beliefs of

consumers at the heginninq of the sample. In what follows, it
is

important

to distinguish between the prior beliefs attributed

to consumers and those which the econometrician might hold. The
puroose of Bayesian analysis here is to generate a reasonable
series for expected real interest rates, not to impose anyone's

prior heiefs about parameter values. In particular, at no time
is any informative prior placed on the parameter of highest

scientific interest, the intertemporal elasticity 2

the coefficients, h, the less precise is
about the elasticity.

Data are observed annually, hut consumption is measured as the

average flow over a calendar quarter. The

theory

as developed

earlier aoplies to consumption measured instantaneously,

seoarated by a time span of any length. In practice, the time
span should be long enough to permit consumers to assimilate
information and put consumption plans into effect; a year seems
reasonahl.. e from this point of view. Hansen and Singleton (1981)

make use of unpublished monthly data on consumption, which might

offer some further advantages. Again, an annual spacing of
observations seems most harmonious with the theory.
It is important that the variables used by consumers to

For quarterly series (p and y) I used data for the third

quarter. They are not actually published until about three

—21—

weeks into the fourth quarter, but this does not appear to be an

important problem. For m I used data for September; again,
these

are

not published until the first week of the fourth

auarter. The stock market index, h, is puhished essentially
instantaneously, but for the results in this version of the

paper I used its average value over the third quarter. The
timing of the dividend yield series, d, is ambiguous. I used
the value reported by Standard and Poor's for the third quarter,

hut this seems to involve some averaging with earlier data, and

a series with higher predictive Power may be available. For the

Treasury bj1 ye1d, z, I used monthly data for September,
though, again, instantaneous data might he sli.ghtly superior.

For the no&nal passbook rate on savings accounts, q, I used the
value specif3ed in the requlations prevailing at the end of
September.

After—tax magnitudes were calculated using the effective
marc,inal rate under the federal personal income tax from John

Seater (1980). The fu'l nominal amount of dividends and
interest was assumed to he taxed at this effective marginal

rate. Capital gains and ].osses were assumed to be untaxed, on
the grounds that the combination of low statutory rates,
taxation only at realization, and forgiveness of accrued gains
at death make the effective rate close to zero.

All data for the study are listed in an appendix available
from the author.

Resu].ts

Before plunging nto formal econometric results, I think it is
useful to indicate why the data

virtually

dictate the answer

that nervaThs of the the results of this paper, namely that the

'ntertemporal elasticity of substitution is small. Some simple
facts about the data are apparent just by taking averages over
the first half of the postwar period (1952 throught 1965) and

the second half (l96 through 1979):

All three measures of real returns were lower in the second half
of the era, vet the growth of consumption was almost unchanged.
A very rough estimate of the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution is the ratio of the decline in the rate of growth
of consumi,tion (0.4 percentacie points) to the decline in the

real return (12.8 percentage points for the stock market, 3.5
points for passbook savings, and 1.5 points for Treasury bills).
These ratios are 0.031, 0.114, and 0.270, actually quite close
to what emerges from formal econometric analysis.

overhwelmnqly rejected. Although it is

true

that this equation

is the result of an informal specification search, every
can'-'iate in the search revealed an important predictable

element in rea1 returns. Every equation explained at least half

of the variance o r. All agreed that expected real returns in
the stock market decined over the period, a finding that
confirms results reported by Eugene Fama (1980)

Second, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, s, (the

coefficient of r in the consumption equation) is estimated
quite precisely to he small. The 95 percent confidence interval
incJurles values of s only up to about 0.05.

Table 1 gives the actual and fitted values for the real return
and the rate of growth of consumption, and shows clearly the
problem with

the

conventional econometric model of expectations

common stocks. Although the equation for the real rate includes
onv fi.ve variables, its fitted values manage to pick up an
astonishinq amount of the actual variability of the left—hand

variable. The equation correctly signals the stock market
breaks of 1962, 1966, 1969, 1973—74, and 1977. An investor who

based on the equation. But this is only a variant of the
trivial ohservation that perfect foresight will make any

investor infinitely rich. The rule itself embodies a lot of
foresight.

The expected real return inferred from the conventional
snecification of expectations is excessively and implausibly

volatile. Armed only with the evidence actually available in
each year, nobody would

as wide fluctuations as appear

fitted values for the real return in Table

1.

Correspondingly, the finding of a small coefficient when the
fitted value is the right—hand variable in the consumption

equation is no surprise. Ry the standard argument of errors in
variables, a noisy right—hand variable receives a coefficient
that is biased

toward zero. Nonetheless, a good deal of

investigation suggests that the true coefficient of the expected

real return in the consumption equation is small, even though
the standard econometric technique very clearly uses an estimate

of the expected real return that is badly contaminated. In the
first place, the simple manipulation reported at the beginning

of this section is quite robust, though inefficient. In the
standard econometric framework, it amounts to the use of a

single time dummy as the only predictor in the equation for the

rea! return. Because of its simplicity, it is much less likely
to introduce excess variation into the predicted real return.

of the real return is the most promising way

The prior distribution in this analysis is not a statement
about the investigator's beliefs, as in the usual application of

Bayesian analysis. Rather, it summarizes what the public
believed in 1953 and so presumably is related to sample evidence

from earlier years. The conclusion about the low value of the

intertem!,oral elasticity of SUhStjttj is not sensitive to the
precision of the prior. With the precision increased by a
factor of 3 the coefficient on

—31—

standard error of the elasticity,

S.

But all results agree on

the low va'ue of s.

Sav.ngs accounts

A surprisinci1v large volume of household wealth is held in the

form of savings accounts, so it is relevant to examine the
relation between their real return to and the rate of change of

consur1pton. Recall

that

the basic relation derived at the

beginning of the paper applies to each asset when consumers face

numerous alternative means for holding wealth. For savings
accounts much the same conclusion emerges as for stocks:

By any

reasonabje measure, anticipated real returns have declined
substantially over the past thirty years, while the rate of

growth of consumption has remained almost constant. These two
facts are consistent only with a low elasticity of intertemporal

suhtitutj.
l3ecause the nominal return to savings accounts is tightly

regulated and changes infrequently by

small

amounts, the main

problem in predicted real returns is predicting inflation.

Lagged nominal variables, particularly the money stock and
lagged inflation, might seem logical candidates for predicting

—32--

the

real return,

and

this

indeed turns out to he the case. The

laqqed change in the nominal value of common stocks also emerged

as a useful predictor over the whole sample. Because the real
return to savinqs accounts fluctuates relatively little, the

However, as Euqene Fama (1975) pointed out, the expected real

other forms of consumer assets, there has not been a pronounced

decline in the real earninqs of Treasury hills. Consequently,

brief

comments.

First, the substitution elasticity controls the speed of
convergence of the simple general equilibrium model to its
steae9v state. If the elasticity is zero, then convergence never
occurs——the lonq—run state of the economy depends on its initial

conitions. The simple

idea

conveyed by

the

model with positive

substitution that eventually the economy moves to a point where
the marqinal product of capital equals the rate of time
preference does not appl'7 when the elasticity is

zero.

It is

virtuaUy irrelevant with very low but positivevalues of the
elasticity,

because

convergence can take thousands of years.

Second, the strength of the intergenerational redistribution
effects of the national, debt or unfunded social security,

debated recently by Robert Barro (1976) and Martin Feldstein
(1976) ,

deend

on the elasticity of substitution. Of course, as

Barro points out,

if

families hehave as single individuals with

infinite lifetimes, redistribution among generations is

meaningless. But if the economy contains isolated individuals
with finite lifetimes, then the elasticity of substitution
governs the extent to which redistribution of consumption within
lifetimes offsets the government's attempt to redistribute

consumption across aenerations. With low substitution,
