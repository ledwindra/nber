The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08: Is it Unprecedented?

NBER Working Paper No. 16589
December 2010
JEL No. E30,G01,N20
ABSTRACT
This paper compares the recent global crisis and recession to earlier international financial crises and
recessions. Based on existing chronologies of banking, currency and debt crises we identify clusters
of crises. We use an identification of extreme events and a weighting scheme based on real GDP relative
to the U.S. to identify global financial crises since 1880. For banking crises we identify five global
ones since 1880: 1890-91, 1907-08, 1913-14, 1931-32, 2007-2008.
In terms of global incidence the recent crisis is fourth in ranking and comparable to 1907-08. We also
calculate output losses during the recessions associated with global financial crises and again the recent
crisis is similar in severity to 1907-08 and is fourth in ranking. On both dimensions the recent crisis
is a pale shadow of the Great depression. The relatively mild experience of the recent crisis may reflect
institutional and policy learning.

1. Introduction

A financial crisis in the US in 2007 spread to Europe and led to a recession across the
world in 2007-2009. Have we seen patterns like this before or is the recent experience
novel? This paper compares the recent crisis and recent recession to earlier international
financial crises and global recessions.

First we review the dimensions of the recent crisis. We then present some historical
narrative on earlier global crises in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The
description of earlier global crises leads to a sense of déjà vu.

We next demarcate several chronologies of the incidence of various kinds of crises:
banking, currency and debt crises and combinations of them across a large number of
countries for the period from 1880 to 2010. These chronologies come from earlier work
of Bordo with Barry Eichengreen, Daniela Klingebiel and Maria Soledad Martinez-Peria
and with Chris Meissner (Bordo et al (2001), Bordo and Meissner ( 2007)) , from
Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff’s recent book (2009) and studies by the IMF
( Laeven and Valencia 2009,2010).1 Based on these chronologies we look for clusters of
crisis events which occur in a number of countries and across continents. These we label
global financial crises.

1

There is considerable overlap in the different chronologies as Reinhart and Rogoff incorporated many of
our dates and my coauthors and I used IMF and World Bank chronologies for the period since the early
1970s.

2

International financial crises inevitably are associated with recessions. We then ascertain
the impact of the global financial crises identified by our cluster analysis on real output in
the countries affected. To do this we first demarcate business cycle turning points in the
countries affected by the global crises and then measure the accumulated output losses in
the recessions associated with the identified crises. Not surprisingly we find that the
economic impact of the Great Depression dwarfed that of the recent crisis but so did
several other historic global financial crises. We consider several factors that could
explain the patterns of global financial crises. These include globalization, the gold
standard and whether the US was in crisis. We conclude with some policy implications
of our evidence.

2. Dimensions of the Recent Global Financial Crisis

The collapse in the subprime mortgage market after the collapse of a major housing boom
in the U.S. (which had been propelled by expansionary monetary policy and long
standing government policies encouraging home ownership) and the plunge in values of
mortgage backed securities in the US in 1907, led to a crisis in the US Shadow banking
system (non bank financial intermediaries that had issued and held mortgage backed
securities) (Gorton 2010). These pressures led to liquidity shortages in the interbank
wholesale markets that funded the financial sector. The crisis spread to European banks
via the drying up of interbank liquidity which led inter alia to the run on Northern Rock
in the UK in September 2007 and the exposure of European banks to mortgage backed

3

securities held in off balance sheet SIVs which led to threats to the solvency of banks in
Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Switzerland and Iceland.

Although the Federal Reserve, ECB and Bank of England provided ample liquidity in the
fall of 2007 the crisis worsened with the collapse of Lehman Brothers (in which case the
US monetary authorities did an about face after having bailed out Bear Stearns in March
2008 )and the near collapse of AIG ( saved by a huge bailout) in September 2008.

A credit crunch and a pause in expansionary monetary policy in early 2008 reflecting a
misplaced fear of commodity price hikes leading to inflation (Hetzel 2009) led to a
recession in the US and Europe. The advanced country recession and a collapse in
international trade finance greatly reduced exports from China and other emerging Asian
countries as well as the rest of the world leading to a global downturn. In addition several
eastern European countries were hit by crisis because they were overexposed to foreign
currency denominated debt. They were rescued by the IMF.

The global crisis ended with government bailouts of insolvent banks, guarantees of the
liabilities of the banking system, the provision of credit facilities to unclog financial
markets and expansionary monetary and fiscal policy in many countries. The global
recovery began in the summer of 2009 making the recession which began in late 2007 in
the US and other countries the longest (and possibly the deepest one) in the postwar era.

3. Historical Patterns in International Financial Crises

We provide a brief narrative of events which could be characterized as global financial
crises. We also demarcate several episodes which were primarily regional rather than
global crises.

We first define our terms. The essence of a financial crisis is a banking crisis (Schwartz
1986). According to Bordo, Eichengreen et al ( 2001) “for an episode to qualify as a
banking crisis ,we must observe either bank runs, widespread bank failures and the
suspension of deposits into currency such that the latter circulates at a premium relative
to deposits ( a banking panic), or significant banking sector problems( including but not
limited to bank failures) resulting in the erosion of most or all of banking system
collateral that are resolved by a fiscally underwritten bank restructuring’

This definition allows us to distinguish between pre 1914 banking panics in which lender
of last resort intervention was either absent or unsuccessful, and subsequent crises in
which a lender of last resort or deposit insurance was in place and the main problem was
bank insolvency rather than illiquidity.2

2

Reinhart and Rogoff ( 2009) have a different more liberal definition “ We mark a banking crisis by two
types of events: (1) bank runs that lead to the closure, merging or takeover by the public sector of one or
more financial institutions and (2) if there are no runs, the closure, merging, takeover or large scale
government assistance of an important financial institution ( or group of institutions) that mark the start of a
string of similar outcomes for other financial institutions” page 10.

Financial crises are aggravated when they lead to or are accompanied by currency crises
(a speculative attack on a pegged exchange rate) and debt crises (sovereign debt defaults).
International financial crises are banking crises that are often accompanied by currency
crises (twin crises) or by debt crises (or by both currency and debt crises together) that
occur in multiple countries and across continents. They also involve both advanced and
emerging countries.

Such events are often triggered by asset price booms and busts in key countries. Stock
market and property booms often burst preceding financial crises (Bordo 2003).

The world has seen a number of global financial crises since the beginning of the
nineteenth century and even before (Kindleberger 1978). Before World War I they
occurred in an environment of globalization—the integration of goods, labor and capital
markets in which free capital mobility often was at the heart of asset booms and busts that
led to crises. They also occurred under the classical gold standard which linked countries
together by fixed exchange rates. In the interwar period major financial crises occurred
after the world returned to the gold exchange standard. After World War II under the
Bretton Woods system with pegged exchange rates, capital controls and extensive
financial regulation, financial crises were rare although there were frequent currency
crises. Since the early 1970s along with the switch to a floating exchange rate regime (for
the advanced countries), the removal of capital controls, and the liberalization of
domestic financial markets, international financial crises have reappeared.

3.1 The specie standard era

A number of international financial crises involving banking crises in London, the
continent of Europe, the United States and Latin America occurred during the nineteenth
century when most countries were on specie standards (silver, gold, bimetallism). Also in
that century after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, globalization in trade and capital
increased dramatically (Bordo, Taylor and Williamson 2003). We briefly demarcate
several events in the nineteenth century before our data starts in 1880 and then the crisis
events after 1880.

The first international financial crisis was the crisis of 1825 (Neal 1998, Bordo 1998.).
The opening up of Latin America after the overthrow of the Spanish empire led to the
opening up of international trade between England and the Latin American republics and
massive capital flows from London (and the continent) to finance infrastructure, mining
and government. The investment was fueled by easy monetary policy by the Bank of
England. Many of the ventures financed were fraudulent. This led to a boom on the
London stock exchange. Once the capital outflows impinged on the Bank of England’s
gold reserves, Bank rate was raised and the stock market crashed.

This led to a banking panic which was not quickly stemmed by lender of last resort action.
A sudden stop of capital flow from London led to debt defaults, banking panics, currency
crashes across Latin America. The panic in London spread to the continent and according
to some sources, to the US.

7

Banking panics and stock market crashes in London in 1837, 1839, 1847 and 1857 spilled
over to the continent. The first two crises impacted the US via the cotton trade. The 1847
crisis involved a railroad boom, stock market crash and harvest failure. The crisis was
triggered by tight Bank of England policy. The 1857 crisis started in the US with the
failure of the Ohio Life Insurance Company, leading to a stock market crash and banking
panic. This crisis augured the importance of the United States in future global financial
crises. Major banking panics also occurred in London and Germany.

The crisis of 1873 had a global reach. According to Kindleberger (1978) it started with
the collapse of a property boom in Germany and Austria, then spread through the
continent and affected the US as European investors dumped US railroad stocks. The US
had a major panic associated with a corporate governance scandal in the railroad sector
(Benmelech and Bordo 2008). The collapse of that sector contributed to a serious and
drawn out recession. The crisis spread to Latin America via a sudden stop as the Bank of
England raised its bank rate to offset gold outflows (Catao 2006). This led to a series of
debt defaults across the region and a banking crisis in Peru (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009)

3.2 The Classical gold standard era 1880-1913

The pre World War I classical gold standard era witnessed two major global financial
crises; 1890-1893, 1907-1908. In both periods banking, currency and debt crises occurred

8

in countries across the world. In some of the countries affected output losses were very
large (Bordo and Eichengreen 1999).

1890-1893

In the 3 year span there were two big crises centered on 1890 and 1893 with crisis
events also occurring in the intervening years.

The 1890 crisis is usually termed the Baring crisis. In the 1880s substantial capital flows
from the advanced countries of Western Europe to develop the infrastructure of the
periphery occurred during a period of sluggish domestic demand. Major recipients of
these funds were Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The associated land boom financed by
generous bank lending ended in a bust consequent upon the Bank of England and other
European central banks raising their discount rates to stem losses in their gold reserves
(Bordo 2006). The sudden stop led to a banking crisis, debt default and currency crisis in
Argentina. Barings Brothers (a leading London merchant bank) which was heavily
exposed to Argentine debt became insolvent. It was rescued by a lifeboat operation (a
consortium of key London banks that agreed to backstop Barings assets with a British
government guarantee) orchestrated by the Bank of England which prevented a banking
panic. But panics did occur in numerous European countries, and in Latin America. In
addition to Argentina, a triple crisis occurred in Portugal while the US, Brazil, and Russia
had twin crises.

9

In an environment of continued financial stringency following the Baring crisis, a major
twin crisis broke out in the US in 1893 reflecting concerns over threats by the Free Silver
movement to its continued adherence to the gold standard (Friedman and Schwartz 1963).
Australia had a major banking panic at the end of a land boom financed by British capital;
triggered by a decline in the terms of trade. Other countries in crisis in 1893 included
New Zealand, Italy, Greece and several Latin American countries. In this period Bordo
and Murshid (2002 and 2007) find evidence of both contagion between the core and
periphery countries and a significant risk of a global financial crisis.

The second major global financial crisis was in 1907. A banking panic in the autumn in
the US was at the heart of it. It may have been triggered by the Bank of England
discriminating against merchant banks financing US trade following large payments by
British insurance companies to cover losses stemming from the San Francisco earthquake
(Odell and Wiedenmeir 2005).Other countries hit by banking crises included France,
Italy(which had a twin crisis), Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Chile and Mexico. This crisis
led to significant output losses in several countries (Bordo and Eichengreen 1999).

The last big crisis in this era was in 1914 at the outbreak of World War One reflecting a
global demand for liquidity. Massive lender of last resort operations ( eg the US invoked
the Aldrich Vreeland Act and issued emergency currency),the closing of stock exchanges
and the imposition of capital controls in many countries prevented panics in many
countries .
.

3.3 The Interwar period 1919-1939

The interwar period is notorious for financial crises. They occurred in two waves: 192025 and 1929-33.

The crises of the 1920-25 period reflected the attempts globally by central banks to
unwind the inflation that had built up in the War. It also reflected global imbalances
reflecting shifts in the pattern of global production and agriculture. Disinflation impinged
upon the balance sheets of many European countries leading to banking crises in the
Scanadanavian countries, the Netherlands, Italy as well as in Japan, Mexico and
elsewhere. Some of these were twin crises. The brief global recession of 1920-22 was
quite severe.

1929-33: The Great Contraction.

This episode is infamous as the worst of all crisis periods. It was preceded by stock
market crashes in the US and UK. A series of banking panics in the US beginning in
October 1930 were not successfully allayed by the Federal Reserve (Friedman and
Schwartz 1963 and Bordo and Landon Lane 2010) and turned a serious recession into the
Great Depression. The depression was transmitted around the world by the fixed
exchange rate links of the gold exchange standard (Friedman and Schwartz 1963) and by
the implosion of international fiduciary currency reserves built upon a thin film of

11

international gold reserves (Bernanke 2002). Adherents to the gold exchange standard
who lacked credibility were prevented by “golden fetters” from offsetting banking panics
(expansionary monetary policy would have led to a speculative attack on the gold parity)
which proliferated across Europe, (Eichengreen 1992). Many countries across the world
also were hit by debt and currency crises. Countries only extricated themselves from
depression when they left the gold standard and followed expansionary monetary policy.
The banking panics and deep deflation greatly worsened the real economies of countries
which experienced them (Bernanke and James 1991).

3.4. Post World War II: Bretton Woods 1944-1973

In the Bretton Woods adjustable peg regime characterized by widespread capital controls
and extensive financial regulation designed to prevent a reoccurrence of the financial
chaos of the interwar, there were very few banking crises (or debt crises). However there
were frequent currency crises as many countries were unable to align their domestic
financial policies with their pegged currencies (Bordo 1993).

3.5 The Managed Float and a Return to Globalization 1973 -2010

After the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system the global financial economy reopened.
In addition, in the face of high inflation many controls on the banking and financial
system began to crumble. The financial crisis problem of earlier eras returned.

12

3.5.1 The 1970s.

Banking crises erupted in both advanced and emerging countries in the 1970s. In 1974 in
the US, Franklin National bank was bailed out while in Germany Herstatt bank was not.
Neither of these events were classic banking crises. Other European countries witnessed
significant bank failures as did other parts of the world. In the emerging countries there
were scores of currency crises. However in this decade it is difficult to discern a global
financial crisis.

3.5.2 The 1980s.

The 1970s was the height of the Great Inflation the causes of which include a misplaced
emphasis on the Phillips curve, the end of the gold discipline of the Bretton Woods
system and the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1978. At the end of the 70s the US and other
advanced countries shifted to a very tight monetary policy to break the back of
inflationary expectations. In addition to precipitating one of the worst postwar recessions
in many countries the tight policies also led many countries in Latin America and
elsewhere to default on debts built up in the preceding inflationary era.

The Latin American debt crisis beginning in 1982 in which amongst others Mexico,
Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and diverse countries like Egypt and Turkey defaulted on their
sovereign debt, triggering financial difficulties for banks across the world. Many had lent

13

money to the countries affected. In the US key money center banks like Chase and
Citibank were bailed out.

The IMF and World Bank report scores of banking crises in emerging countries in this
decade. The period 1982-84 may constitute a global financial crisis.

3.5.2 The 1990s

The 1990s was characterized by three regional financial crises: in Europe 1990-91, the
Tequila Crisis in 1994 and the Asian crisis of 1997-98.3

Europe

The liberalization of financial markets in many countries in the late 1980s led to a series
of financial crises. In the Nordic countries freeing the banks from extensive controls led
to a property boom in Sweden and Finland. A bust was triggered by the EMS crisis and
the breakdown of the Soviet empire. These forces produced the Nordic banking and
currency crisis (Jonung and Hagberg. 2005). Banks also failed in Norway. Other
countries like Italy and Australia also had banking crises in this period.

3

Japan had a major banking crisis after the bursting of property and stock bubbles in 1989. Although this
likely contributed to the Asian Crisis of 1997 , it was not an international financial crisis.

14

The Tequila crisis.

Tight Federal Reserve policy in reaction to an inflation scare may have been the trigger
for a massive devaluation by Mexico in 1994. This led to a banking crisis and a rescue
package arranged by the US. Other Latin countries also were hit by debt, banking and
currency crises referred to as the tequila effect. Impact on the advanced countries was
minimal.

The Asian Crisis 1997-1998.

The causes for the massive currency and banking crises in Thailand, Indonesia, Korea as
well as less dramatic disruption in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan
include: overvalued currency pegs, original sin (liability dollarization,) the drying up of
Japanese lending after its banking crisis, corporate malfeasance and corruption. These
crises had contagion effects on other emerging countries possibly reflecting stringency in
advanced country lending. Two prominent countries were Russia which defaulted on its
debt in 1998 and Brazil which had a serious currency crisis in 1998. A threat by the
Russian Crisis to the advanced countries by the incipient collapse of LTCM, a large
hedge fund, which was greatly exposed to Russian debt which seriously exposed the
balance sheets of important counterparties( including New York money center banks) to
loss, , was offset by a Federal Reserve arranged rescue.

15

The Asian crisis had impact across many emerging countries but did not seriously impact
the advanced countries. However many have argued that if it weren’t for the generous
rescue packages provided by the IMF, other governments, and other agencies it would
have become one. On the other hand, others have argued that the rescues were largely
bailouts which would engender future moral hazard (Bordo and Schwartz , 2000).

4. Empirical Evidence

4.1 Identifying Global Crises

In order to quantify the effect that a global financial crisis has on a country’s real
economy (business cycle) we first need to identify periods of global financial distress. To
do this we assemble information on three types of financial crises: banking crises,
currency crises, and sovereign debt crises. We have 57 countries in our sample which
runs from 1880 to 2009. Multiple sources were used to accumulate information on these
three types of crises and the information obtained was aggregated into our database. The
raw data on banking crises can be found in Figure A.1 in the appendix and the raw data
on currency and debt crises can be found in Figures A.2 and A.3 of the appendix.

The sources used were Bordo et al (2001), Bordo and Meissner (2005), Reinhart and
Rogoff (2009), Laeven and Valencia (2010) and the IMF WEO. The dating of currency
crises using an intersection between an EMP index and narratives is similar across the
chronologies as is the dating of debt crises. However there were some differences

16

between Bordo and coauthors and Reinhart and Rogoff on the definition of banking
crises. Their definition is generally more liberal than ours. They include a number of
episodes as banking crises which we do not, such as minor banking crises in Canada in
1893, the UK in 1991, 1994 and 1995 and there are some they do not include like the
major banking panic in the US in 1893. Also recent work by Nelson and Salido (2010)
show different banking crises in the postwar US than either ours or Reinhart and Rogoff.
They demarcate 1973-75, 1982-84 and 1988-91 as crises whereas Reinhart and Rogoff
designate only 1984 as a banking crisis in that period. In addition Jalil (2010) demarcates
several minor banking crises for the US in the 1920s and also in the nineteenth century
that neither of us demarcates. In this paper we include all the crises reported by the
different authors. We do not distinguish between major and minor banking crises.

In order to identify periods of global crisis we first look for clusters of crises. To do so,
for each year, we count the number of crises for each category. These raw counts are
reported in Figures A4 – A6 in the appendix.4 Candidate global crises are then identified
using a centered moving sum of order 2 of these raw counts. That is for each period we
count the number of unique crises for the current period and the preceding and following
period as well. Peaks in the two-period moving sum series are candidates for periods of
global financial crises.

One important consideration, however, is that not all countries are the same in the sense
that a crisis in a large country (e.g. the U.S.) is different to a crisis in a small country (e.g.

4

As noted above in many instances multiple authors identify the same crisis. In these cases the crisis is
only counted once so as not to bias the results towards finding a global crisis.

17

New Zealand) in its effect on the global economy. To account for this effect we weight
each observation by the country’s real GDP relative to U.S. GDP.5 If a banking crisis
occurs in a country whose real GDP is half that of the United States then the observation
is given a weight of 0.5. This weighted count thus reflects the relative importance of the
country (in terms of its size) when deciding whether a cluster of banking crises
constitutes a global financial crisis.

In determining whether a cluster is a global crisis we use the following rule: 1) we find a
local peak of the two-period moving sum of the weighted count series, yt. A local peak is
defined to be a period (t) where
yt  yt 1 and yt  yt 1 .

(1)

In case of ties, ( yt  yt 1 ) then period t is chosen if yt 1  yt  2 and period t+1 is chosen if
yt  2  yt 1 . 2) The local peak, found in 1), is an extreme value (thus the cluster must be
large enough to be considered a rare event), and 3) the countries making up the cluster
must be from different geographical regions.

A peak is considered an extreme event if the weighted sum of total crises is more than
three standard deviations from the mean. In order to account for outliers the upper 10% of
the data is first trimmed before computing the mean and standard deviation of the data.
Once the cutoff is determined we look at the boundary value of the weighted series. The

18

crisis is considered large and rare if it is in the upper tail of the distribution and has a total
combined weight that is greater than the combined output of the US.

The preceding rule is applied to the data on banking crises, currency crises, and debt
crises individually. It is also applied to a combined banking and currency crisis dataset to
look for global “twin”-crises and to a combined banking, currency and debt crisis dataset
to identify global “triple”-crises, to a combined banking and debt crisis and to a
combined debt and currency crisis data set. The results are given below:

4.1.1 Global Banking Crises

The two-period weighted moving sum banking crisis series is depicted in Figure 1. The
horizontal dashed line represents the three standard deviation threshold for (partly)
determining a global crisis and is equal to 1.75. Thus the five identified global crises have
a weighted sum greater than 1.75. Using the rule outlined above we found global banking
crises in the following periods: 1890-1891, 1907-1908, 1913-1914, 1931-1932, and 20072008. The countries involved in each of these global banking crises are reported in Table
1.

In all of the identified periods countries from at least two (and usually more) distinct
geographical regions are present. The most recent global crisis only contains countries
from North America and Europe whereas the other crises contain countries from at least

three distinct geographical areas. It is also evident from Figure 1 that the most recent
global banking crisis ranks fourth in terms of the weighted sum of countries having
banking crises and appears quite similar to the banking crisis of 1907-1908.

4.1.2 Global Currency Crises

Figure 2 depicts the three period moving sum of the weighted count of currency crises
where again the weights are relative GDP in 1990 dollars. Using the same rule as
described above we identify the following periods as global currency crises: 1890-91,
1893-94, 1931-1932, 1933-34, 1970-71, 1970-1971, 1981-1982, 1986-87, and 1992-1993.

The cutoff for crises to be more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean in this
case is 1.5, thus all identified currency crises have total weight equal to 1.5 times the size
of the U.S. economy. The countries involved in these global currency crises are reported
in Table 2.

There are some noticeable differences in the occurrences of the currency crises compared
with the global banking crises found above. The period from 2007-2008, where we did
identify a global banking crisis, does not have a global currency crisis. In fact there are
only two periods where there are both a global banking crisis and a global currency crisis.
These are the 1931-1932 period, and the 1981-1982 period.

4.1.3 Debt Crises

Figure 3 depicts the weighted moving sum of the number of sovereign debt crises for the
period 1880-2009. Using a threshold of 3 standard deviations above the mean there are a
number of peaks identified. However, in no case was the peak large enough to be
considered a global crisis; the largest peak was in 1932 and had a value of 0.58. Thus our
identification does not yield any debt crises important enough to be declared a global debt
crisis. Again we do not observe any global debt crisis for the most recent period (20072008)

4.2 Global “Twin”-Crises

23

In the preceding sections we separately identified global crises for banking, currency, and
debt crisis. We found two periods where there were both global banking and global
currency crises. However, this approach did not check whether the countries included in
each type of crisis overlapped or were different. That is, we do not know whether in these
periods there were both a banking crisis and a currency crisis occurring in parallel (i.e. to
two different sets of countries) or in unison (i.e. to the same countries). In this section we
compute the weighted count of the countries having “twin” banking and currency crisis
concurrently. The moving sum of this weighted count of “twin” crises is depicted in
Figure 4.

Using a threshold of three standard deviations only one global “twin”-crisis is identified:
1931-1932. The two peaks in the 1890’s do not constitute a global crisis as only one
country is involved in each case; Brazil for 1889 and the USA for 1893. This suggests
that the other period where there is an overlap of banking crisis and currency crisis: 19811983 (a banking crisis from 1982-83 and a currency crisis from 1981-1982) was a period
where there was both a banking crisis and a currency crisis but that these crises affected
different sets of countries.

Figures 5 and 6 show the weighted moving sum of the other twin crises (Currency and
Debt and Banking and Debt) and we identify no periods where there were significant
numbers of these types of twin crises.

4.3 Global “Triple” Crises

Previously we did not identify any periods where there were any global debt crises. In
this section we compute weighted counts of countries having all three crises at once and
the moving sum of these weighted counts is depicted in Figure 7. Again there are no
periods that we can identify where there were a significant number of countries having
“triple” crises.

4.4 Robustness
In order to check that our findings are robust to our method we tried a number of
alternative approaches. First we used a fixed threshold to identify a global crisis rather
than use the three standard deviation approach described above. Second we used a three

27

period moving average instead of the two-period moving average reported above. Third,
we used relative per capita real income rather than relative real income as the weight.
For all alternatives the main conclusions that we draw are unaltered. The main
differences between the alternative approaches are the identification of smaller crises
periods when using per capita real income as the weight. All the crises periods identified
above are identified using the other methods.

5. Comparing and Quantifying the Crises

In Section 5 we used informal “cluster” analysis to identify global crises. In that section
we combined data sets on crises from a number of sources and counted the number of
observed crises to look for clusters of crises across the world. In this section we turn our
attention to quantifying the “cost” of a recession and compare these costs across the
different types of crisis and non-crisis periods. In order to be consistent we use a
restricted dataset that consists of countries for which we have data that span the entire
sample period from 1880-2009. This restricted set of countries is nonetheless quite varied
and consists of countries from many regions, a variety of levels of development, and a
variety of levels of openness.

The countries that are included in this analysis are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The United

28

Kingdom, Uruguay, and The United States of America. In order to quantify the loss
caused by a recession we first date business cycles for each country by looking for peaks
and troughs of real output for each country using a common business cycle dating
algorithm. We then compute the cost of each recession for each country and compare this
cost across the many different types of crisis periods identified above.

The set of countries included in our analysis is kept constant over the whole sample even
though data for other countries becomes available over time as we wanted to keep a
consistent set of countries for the analysis and to not bias our results. If the countries to
be added were chosen randomly one would not expect the results to be affected by the
addition of extra countries in the later periods but it is fair to assume that the availability
of data is not a random event and most likely a function of a country’s development. Also
the aim of this exercise is to compare recessions across different crisis periods so it is
important to have a consistent set of countries across time.

5.1 Data

The data that we use is real output in constant 1990 dollars and comes from the dataset
compiled by Angus Maddison.

6

This methodology is described in more detail in

Maddison (2007), but nominal output for each country is first converted into 1990 local
currency units and then converted into 1990 dollars using a database of international
comparisons reported by the World Bank in 1990.

The dataset can be found at http://www.ggdc.net/maddison .

5.2 Identifying Cycles and Measuring Loss.

In order to have a consistent set of dating rules across each country in our sample we use
the business cycle dating procedure of Bry and Boschan (1971) that was updated by
Harding and Pagan (2000, 2002). Here we date the classical cycle – that is the turning
points of the level of real output – using the following rules: 1) the minimum length of a
cycle is two years, 2) a recession or an expansion has to be at least one year in length, 3)
peaks and troughs must alternate. The actual peak years and trough years that we use can
be found in Table A.1 of Appendix A.

It should be noted that we could have alternatively looked at growth-cycles – turning
points in the growth rate of real output – but in order to be consistent across the whole
sample period of 1880—2009 we only compare classical cycles. This means that for
latter periods, where the growth of real output is high, some countries have very long
cycles.

There have been many different approaches to quantifying the loss of a recession. Some,
for example Bordo et al (2001) and Laeven and Valencia (2010) use a measure of how
long the economy took to get back to a measure of “potential” output as a measure of the
severity of the recession. Harding and Pagan (2002) discuss a number of different
approaches to measuring the severity of a recession including duration (time from peak to
trough), amplitude (percentage loss from peak output to trough output) and accumulated
loss (the sum of the percentage differences from peak output to all output levels for each

30

period of the recession). This last measure approximates the area above the actual level of
output and the projection of peak output out horizontally for the duration of the recession.
Harding and Pagan (2002) also use a measure of the steepness of the recession by
measuring the difference between the actual accumulated loss and the loss if actual
output followed a straight line from peak output to trough output – which they call an
excess loss measure.

In our approach we use the accumulated percentage loss as our measure of the severity of
a recession. This measure has the benefit of combining information about the recession’s
depth and duration into one number. The problem with using only amplitude or only
duration is that it would be hard to compare a short but sharp recession with a long but
shallow recession. Which of these recessions are worse? One would have a longer
duration and the other would have larger amplitude. The accumulated percentage loss
measures the total loss due to a recession as a percentage of the peak level of output and
is able to compare all types of recessions. We do not use the other Harding and Pagan
(2002) measure (the excess measure) as our dating rules allow for one year recessions
which would necessarily yield zero excess.

The other measures mentioned above that measure how long it takes the economy to get
back to a measure of potential output are not used either. The main reason is that we want
to compare the severity of the most recent banking crisis in terms of the effect on the
severity of recession during this period. As most economies in our sample had peaks in
either 2007 or 2008 there is not enough data to compute this measure. Since we are not

31

able to use this duration measure to compare the severity of recessions across the
different periods with the most recent recessions we do not report the severity measures
of Bordo et al (2001).

5.3 Results from our Comparisons

As noted above we use a consistent classical business cycle dating algorithm to date
classical business cycles for each of the 23 countries in our sample from 1880 until
2009.7 For each recession that is identified we compute the accumulated percentage loss
of the recession compared to the counterfactual that the country stayed at peak output for
the entire duration of the recession. If the last identified turning point was a peak then we
measured the accumulated loss from this peak until the end of the sample in 2009. For
most countries the last identified peak was in 2007 and 2008 and there is considerable
evidence that these countries have troughed by 2009 (although the algorithm cannot
determine this without knowing the level of output for 2010). Given that we don’t know
the actual trough dates for the last recession we obviously run the risk of having truncated
measures but we do not think this is a major issue given that most of the countries in our
sample appear to have troughed by the end of 2009.

In order to account for country size we weight each loss measure by the country’s relative
GDP relative to that of the United States. Once we compute the measure of severity for
each recession we then compare the severity of recessions over all of the sample and in
particular during periods of crisis. Some summary statistical results on the severity of the
7

For Argentina we only have data from 1884.

recessions can be found in Table 5. The statistics that are reported are the mean of the
distribution, the median of the distribution, and the 25th and 75th percentiles (the interquartile range).

The first number that is reported in Table 5 is for all recessions in our sample. The mean
weighted (weighted by relative GDP) accumulated percentage loss for all recessions in
our sample is -1.12% but it is clear that the distribution of accumulated losses is highly
skewed to the left as the median and 25th and 75th percentiles are much smaller at -0.15%,
-0.68%, and -0.05% respectively. Thus the distribution of accumulated loss of a recession
is skewed to the left with a large number of large negative losses. That is, the distribution
has a “fat” lower tail.

Next we report the mean, median, and inter-quartile range for those recessions that do not
overlap any of the crisis (banking, currency, or debt) periods and for those that do overlap

33

with any of the crisis periods. 8 The mean accumulated loss during a crisis period is
approximately twice that for recessions that occur outside of any of the crisis windows.
The median and 25th percentiles are also shifted left suggesting that recessions during
crises are worse, in terms of accumulated percentage loss, than recessions during noncrisis periods.

We next split the crisis periods into their respective types and report results for the three
types of crises that we identify: banking crises and currency crises. Looking first at
banking crises (periods where there is a global banking crisis) we observe that the loss
distribution is heavily skewed to the left with a mean loss of around -3.03% and a median
loss of around -0.62%. We also split the sample into those countries that actually have a
banking crisis and those who do not (but nonetheless have a recession during a global
banking crisis) and find that countries that have a banking crisis have slightly larger
losses than those countries that do not.

The pattern for the currency crises is different. Again a currency crisis is a period where
there is a currency crisis. First it is clear that recessions during currency crises are not as
severe as during banking crises. There appears to be a discernable difference between
those countries having a currency crisis (their recessions are worse) than those not having
a currency crisis but having a recession during a currency crisis.

8

A recession is deemed to overlap if any of the periods of the recession overlap with any of the periods of
the crisis window.

34

5.3.1 Comparing Individual Banking Crises

The results of the previous section suggest that banking crises are the more important
crises to consider given that recessions associated with them are large and there appears
to be more spillover from crisis countries to other countries for banking crises than other
types of crises. Because of this and the fact that the most recent crisis is a “pure” banking
crisis we next focus our attention on the individual banking crises that we have identified.

The results reported in Table 5 are for all the banking crises across all periods and it is
useful to be able to compare each crisis window to each other. This comparison is
reported in Table 6. Here the summary statistics are reported for each crisis window
identified in Section 5. The results show that clearly the banking crisis of the 1930’s was
associated with much more severe recessions than any other crisis window. The most
recent crisis has relatively small losses compared to the other major banking crises.

Another interesting point to note about the most recent crisis is that the tail of the
accumulated loss distribution is not as “fat” as for the other preceding crises. Figures 8
and 8a contain boxplot graphs depicting the weighted accumulated percentage loss
distributions for each of the identified banking crises windows. The boxplots graphically
report the same information as Table 6. More importantly they also report the tail of the
distribution. Each boxplot reports a box which runs from the 25th percentile to the 75th
percentile. The red line reports the median. The closer the red line is to the 75th percentile

(the top line of the box in this case) the more skewed the distribution. Any observations
that lie outside the inter-quartile range are depicted with red ‘+’ symbols.

Looking at Figures 8 and 8a we see that the most recent crisis is the only crisis without a
very long lower (left) tail. Alternatively, if the distribution is skewed like the other crises
the tail is much shorter. Unlike the other crises, there are no really large losses associated
with the most recent crisis, with the largest accumulated loss being less than 5%.

For Figures 8 and 8a the left tail of the distribution for the 1931-32 crisis is cutoff at -30%. Some
observations with weighted losses less than -30 are not reported.

37

The conclusions one can draw from these observations is that the recessions associated
with the most recent financial crisis were indeed quite unprecedented given 1) the fact
that the output losses were at the low end of what we would have expected after looking
at the previous major banking crises and 2) we did not observe any really large negative
losses (no fat left tail). This is unprecedented given the previous experience of global
banking crises.

6. Discussion

Our empirical evidence in the preceding section indicates that since 1880 the world has
witnessed 5 global financial (banking) crises.10 This result is based on our aggregation of
several chronologies of banking crises where we calculate a moving sum of the weighted
counts by country size and condition on crisis incidence across continents. When we add
in currency crises and search for global twin crises we only find one in the 1930s. When
we add debt crises to the total we find that no triple global crises occurred. In terms of
incidence weighted by country size the 1930s was the worst global crisis by far, followed
by the recent crisis. Although the number of countries affected by crises was lower than
some of the historic crises, the presence of the US and other major countries makes the
recent crisis important in terms of the number and size of countries involved.

We also measured the output losses in global crises. We used a business cycle dating
algorithm to date classical business cycles and for each recession we computed the
accumulated percentage loss as our measure of the severity of a recession. We found that
10

This number is increased to 9 crises when we use a larger window in our moving sum.

38

the distribution of recessions associated with crises was highly skewed with a fat left tail
and that the mean accumulated percentage loss was higher for recessions associated with
crises than those that were not associated with crises. We also found that recessions
associated with banking crises were worse than those associated with currency crises and
we found that banking crises appeared to affect all countries more than currency crises.
The losses during recessions associated with currency crises were larger for those
countries having a currency crisis than those that did not.

We then compared the 5 global banking crises that we identified and found that the
recessions associated with the most recent crisis was quite similar in average loss to the
crises of 1907-08 crisis but not as large as in the 1890-91 and the 1913-14 crises. The
other important finding is that the most recent crisis is not associated with a highly
skewed loss distribution. Unlike all other banking crises there are no really large negative
losses. This result is unprecedented.

Thus, global financial crises have occurred before this one. The most recent crisis appears
quite similar in its economic impact to the crisis of 1907-08 in that the recessions
associated with it are small relative to other crises in history. It is certainly not the worst
crisis in recent history and is most likely not the worst crisis since the Great Depression,
at least with respect to output losses of recessions associated with the crisis.

39

Moreover from our evidence we see that there is a clear link between international
financial crises and the severity of recessions. Indeed global crises may help synchronize
the business cycle (Bordo and Helbling 2010).

We summarize some possible factors that can explain the incidence of global financial
crises. First, international financial crises since at least 1857 seem to occur when the US
(the largest economy since the end of the nineteenth century) is involved. One strong
possible reason for the U.S. involvement in global financial crises is that the US banking
system has long been crisis prone. In the pre 1914 era this reflected two basic problems;
unit banking and the absence of an effective lender of last resort. This contrasted with
many of the other advanced countries which had nationwide branch banking systems
which could more easily diversity portfolios across regions and also which had central
banks which had learned by the 1870s to act as lenders of last resort to the financial
system. .London was also important as a focal point for the global transmission of crises
before 1914 but the Bank of England had learned to become an effective lender of last
resort. England had its last banking crisis in 1866.

Since 1914 the US has had a central bank, the Federal Reserve, which was established in
large part to prevent the type of banking panics which characterized the National banking
era (1965 to 1914). However the Fed failed in its role as lender of last resort to allay a
series of banking panics in the 1930s which it is argued precipitated the Great Depression.
In addition the US kept unit banking (in most states) after the establishment of the Fed
until very recently.

40

The US has also since 1865 had a Dual banking system in which state banks ( with lower
capital and reserve requirements) have been regulated by state banking authorities while
national

banks

have

been

regulated

by

the

federal

Comptroller

of

the

Currency .According to White (1982) this fostered regulatory competition, inefficiency
and instability). Moreover for seven decades after 1914 member banks of the Federal
Reserve (all national banks and some state banks) were supervised by the Federal
Reserve). Since the 1930s a new patch work of regulatory agencies has proliferated to
supervise and regulate the diverse parts of the non bank financial system. Heavy
regulation may explain the absence of banking crises in the U.S (as well as the rest of the
world) from the 1930s to the 1970s. The lack of regulatory coordination and failures in
supervision in the U.S. may have been a cause of the recent crisis.

Second, financial globalization seems to be an important part of the story of global
financial crises. The free movement of global capital and frequent sudden stops was a key
element in the global crisis environment of the 19th century (Bordo, Cavallo and
Meissner 2010). These patterns have reemerged in the second era of globalization since
the 1970s.

Third, the international monetary regime was also important in the proliferation of crises.
When the world was on the gold standard both before and after World War I, crises were
transmitted by fixed exchange rates and in the interwar when credibility was low “golden
fetters” prevented many countries from offsetting them. Moreover the alternating waves
of inflation and deflation that reflected the automatic operation of the gold standard pre

41

1914 may have itself triggered financial instability leading to crises (Bordo 1990).
However today most countries (with the principal exception of the European Monetary
Union) are in a managed float regime and global financial crises are present. This
suggests that increasingly tighter linkages between global financial markets and
burgeoning capital flows today operate independently of the exchange rate regime.

Fourth, asset booms fueled by capital inflows and busts triggered by sudden stops were
key elements in many of the international financial crises pre WWI. In the interwar the
1920s stock market boom was similar in many respects to the railroad booms of the
nineteenth century and was fueled by international capital flows (Eichengreen 1992,
Bordo 2003). Finance for both the tech boom of the late 90s and the recent property
booms in the US and elsewhere had an important international element manifest in the
international scope of securitization and the global proliferation of derivatives.

Policy Lessons

What are some of the policy lessons to be learned from the historical record of global
financial crises?

First, the historical record suggests that international financial crises before 1914 largely
burned themselves out. Countries which had effective LLRs in place like Britain
insulated themselves from them. Others did not and like the US had to suspend
convertibility of bank liabilities into currency. Also the absence of a lender of last resort

42

in the U.S. and key flaws in its banking system made it an important catalyst for
international crises because of its economic importance. Moreover in this era although
there was minimal policy coordination eg between the Bank of England and the Banque
de France in the 1907 crisis, it was minimal and episodic ( Flandreau 1997, Bordo and
Schwartz 1998).In the interwar period the League of Nations was largely ineffective in
coordinating rescues as were other intergovernmental arrangements (Bordo and Schwartz
1999).

In the postwar the IMF and other agencies has dealt with currency crises and debt crises
to some effect. The resolution of banking crises has been largely done by national
monetary authorities. The growing problem of liability dollarization prevented LLR
operations in dollars in the Asian countries hit by crisis in 1997-98. Their problems were
solved by massive international rescues. A similar problem arose in the aftermath of the
recent crisis.

In the recent crisis the question is moot whether international policy coordination was
effective. Many countries did lender of last resort actions to stem the financial crisis in
their own countries. They also pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policy. These
actions likely prevented the recession from being worse. It is not clear that national
authorities pursued these actions because of international arrangements. More likely they
did it because they had learned some lessons from the Great Depression.

43

The lesson from history that countries with sound financial systems, effective lenders of
last resort and efficient financial supervision and regulation fared better in global
financial crises than others has held up in the recent crisis ( Bordo and Meissner 2005).
Countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand whose banks were less exposed to
mortgage backed securities, whose banks did not have SIVs and which did not have
under regulated shadow banking systems largely avoided the recent crisis.

Second, what seems to be novel about the recent crisis is the extent to which financial
innovation partly in response to the supervision and regulation of the banking systems
and financial markets in place in the US and other advanced countries led to the
development of securitization, derivatives and off balance sheet entities designed to
evade capital requirements. These innovations were globally linked through financial
globalization. This increased global systemic risk. In earlier eras, stock (and bond)
markets across countries were linked together during crises but the linkages are much
tighter today and occur across virtually all international financial markets. This
development may make the case for enhanced global financial supervision and regulation
to ameliorate the systemic risks. Although how to achieve this in the face of the sanctity
of sovereignty is problematic to say the least. It also may make the case for capital
controls. However it is not clear that the inefficiencies of widespread capital controls and
the inevitability of their evasion are worth the effort.

Finally, the fact that this crisis was one of the least costly of the global financial crises
suggests that perhaps policy makers in the countries affected learned some of the lessons

44

from the past global financial crises. They followed aggressive expansionary monetary
and fiscal policies. This was certainly not the case before World War II.
