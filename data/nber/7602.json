No previous era and no previous economy has seen material wealth and productive potential grow at such a pace.  The bulk of America's population today achieves standards of material comfort and capabilities that were beyond the reach of even the richest of previous centuries.  Even lower middle-class households in relatively poor countries have today material standards of living that would make them, in many respects, the envy of the powerful and lordly of past centuries.\n\n",
