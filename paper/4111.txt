EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE POR COLLUSION IN TEE U.S. AUTO MARKET?

ABSTRACT

A sopergame theoretic price-setting model of collusion is calibrsted to data frotn the

North Atteorican passengsr car market befoto, dosing, and after the voluntary restraint
arrangcmettts (YRAs) with Japan. Conclusions about whether she model is consistent with the
bans from the various regimes depend on assontptions about market structure, demand elasticities,

sod discs unt factors. If one believes that dte price elasticity of auto demand is about one, for
exutopbs, then the calibrations suggest Etat in, the pre-VR.A and VP,A regimes, only Oenerai
Motors and Pord could conceivably have colluded, and even this limited potential broke down
in the post-VRA regime.

1 introduction
This research examines whether conditions consistent with a familiar model of
impiscit collusion are sadsfied in data for the United States passenger car market during
each of three regimes, The model is a price-setting supergame with asymmetric capacity
constraints, in which excess capacity is taken to 'bnforce "the collusion. The three
regimes are aggregations of years: years prior to the Voluntary Restraint Arrangement
(VRA) 'with Japan; years during the time in which it waa hiudins; and years subsequent

to that time.
Our most important conclusion is that 'whether the nsodci appears bruadiy

consistent with the data depends on what one believes about demand elaancfty and on

what one believes about cartel membership. If one believes thut all three major US
firms and all three major Japanese firms colluded, then the model ma cuns:s:uut yrjmh the
data at very low elasticities of demand (as low as 17, .62, .30 mu the muspnc:mvu reaimes).

These are much lower than generally estimated. Furthermore, the hmgncst of them i5
suspect since the assertion that Japanese firms in the VRA period wore uoiiuding by
restricting output below VRA levels contradicts the evidence. If one bclmcvcs that only
the three major US firms colluded, timen the model is consistent with the data in a

narrow range of elasticities atove .64. .70, and .43 in the respective regimes. Finally, if
one believes that only Oenerai Motors and Ford colluded, a scusible belief if cue accepts
that Chrysler k pour financial cuncitiun made t an untrustworthy conspirator, then

elasticities that range up from i. ii, 1.16, and .73 in the respective regimes support the
mnodel. Hence, if one betmeves that elasticities of much less than one are unreascnabie,

the data are consistent with the story that GM and Ford successfully colluded in the PreVRA and VRA regimes but that their ability to collude was undermined in the PostVP_k regime as Japanese firms engaged in significant direct foreign investment.

The methodoiogy of the research is to conduct fairly stmpie tests of necessary or

sufficient conditions from the modet in each regime. There are two advantages of
conducting the tests for several regimes. Repetition obviously enhances cur confidences

in the conclusions. Furthermore, ii is not unlikely that cartel membership differed across
regimes.

The research has two distinctive analytical features relative to the existing

titerature. Gne is the asymmetry across firms in capacity and excess capacity. The cther
is the consideration of 'bptimal "rules (penal codes) for enforcing collusion.

The research has two distinctive empirical features relative to the existing
ibterature. Gne is a technique for purging the observations of cyclicality, so as to create

a data set relevant for a stationary U.S. auto industry in a sequence of equilibria,

punctuated by the beginning and end of the VRA,' The other is a technique fur
blending fragmentary firm-level and industry-level data to infer important, yet
unobservable, firm-level variables and parameters.

Gne of the most important assumptions that we maintain throughout the paper is
that the mix of model varieties, and the quality and non-price characteristics of each, are
sufficienity similar and stable across the colluding firms during each of the three regimes

that they may he aggregated into a single commodity. Empirical acceptance of this
assumpdon may be facilitated by the two-to-four year length of our regimes. That length

2

was dictated by the timing of the VRA and the need to purge the data of cyclicality. All
things considered, there may be some tradeoff involved in forcing our chosen regime

iengths to reflect three things at once: cyclical stability, trade-policy regime, and
comparability of cross-firm product line.
2, Maximal Cotlnsion with Capacity Constraints
In his criticism of Cournot 's (1838) work, Bertrand (1883) asserted that firms

choose prices rather than quantities. In the real 'world firms usually choose both prices

and quantities, as well as qualities and other characteristics of their outputs. To assume
less is an abstraction and, as usual, the researcher 's problem is to select the most useful
abstraction.

To the extent that the level of production capacity is important, the Bertrand
price-setting model seems to be a superior analytical tool 10 the Cournot quantity-setting

model.2 Furthermore, voluntary restraint arrangements, such as those seen in the U.S.
automobile market during the 1980's, inhibit the foreign firm's ability to choose
quantities, leaving price as their main decision variable over time periods determined by
model mix, quality, and olher slow-to-change features, For Ihese reasons we find the
Bertrand price-setting model a useful abstraction to examine implicit collusion in the
U.S. automobile industry, especially in the context of voluntary export restraints.

We model the major automobile manufacturers as engaging in collusion. Much
work in game theory has gone into developing formal models of collusion. It
demonstrates that players can sustain outcomes that are not consistent with static Nash
equilibria by adopting a penal code that instructs them how to behave after any deviation

3

fr"m collusion an "edt a

f e' any deviation frr"n the edhavior specified by the penal

code. To be effectise a penal code must be credible, that

is,

at each time period and no

n'rsier what has happened ;n tie part, it m:'rt be 'hat each player maxinriaos the present
dircounted value of his payoffs by obeying the penal code from then on, given that all

other players do likewise One example of a credible penal code is attributed to
Friedman (1971). His penal code instructs all players to choose static Nash strategies in

all periods following any devia'ion. The search for optimal penal codes that is. the
oredibie penal codes which most severely punish deviatinn and henoe can support the
rraximai possible collusion, was greedy advanoed by the 'york of Abreu (1988). Lambson
(1927. 1991) applied Abreu 's results 'o Bertrand games.

The model studied in this paper is one of asymmetric Bertrand oligopoly:

although the firms are assumed to have the same ma-ginsi cost, c, they have different
_apaoities, with k defined as the capaoity of firm i. They produce a cross-sectionally

hom'geneous product--an assumption which requires that the mix of model varieties and

'h' p ality of non-price characteristics of each be similar aid stable across ooiluding

rns during each of the three periods. To the extent that the firms compete in most of
tue ditferent product liner, and 10 the extent that they behave in each product line in a
way similar o the behavior postulated below, we might hope that the aggregated markets
will also be characterized by that behavior,

Firms are modeled as having an infinite horizon, 'with the (discrete) time periods

bring indexed by t. At the beginning of each period fl-ms choose prices for the period
rinu.lmnecuaiy. After firms announce prices consumers attempt to purchase from firms

charging the lowest price. Any unsatisfied demanders then attempt to purchase from
firms charging the next lowest price, and so on. If the lowest price firms do not have
sufficient capacity to supply the quantity demanded at their price, a rationing rule is

required to determine how their oulput is allocated among consumers. We adopt the
Levitan-Shubik (1972) rule which requires that consumers with higher reservation prices

be served first. This is the relevant rule if there is a secondary market for the good
because low reservation price consumers who acquire the good will in turn sell it to high
reservation price consumers. (Alternatively, the Levitan-Shubik rule can be thought of as
ignoring aggregate income effects.) Hence, if firm i is the only firm charging the price p

then its sates are mm (k, max [D(p) - E<k,OJ} where D(p) is total demand when all
firms charge p and where

denotes summation over firms charging less than p. If two

or more firms charge p then their total sales are mm (Ek, max {D(p) - E,kt,O]), where
denotes summations over firms charging p. Firms charging the same price must agree
on how to divide sates,3

Let P = (p,.., Pa) be the vecter of prices charged by the firms. (It is
sometimes convenient to write P in the form (, PJ; the price before the sentieoion is
firm iS price and the price vector after the semicolon is the vector of other firms'prices.)

Then firm i's profit function, riP), is simply (p - c) times firm i's sates.

Let p(t,i) be a price, let P(t,i) = [p(t,i)

vectors i = {P(t,i) } ,

p(t,i)], define the sequence of price

and define r = (q,,..p). Then i is a poishmnent (for player i)

and r is a (simple) penal code. Firms can agree on a penal code in order to sustain an
agreed upon collusive price, say .

If any firm, say firm i, charges a price other than
5

then, in the next period, flrms begin to follow the punishment prloe path described by r.

If any firm, say j (perhaps equal to i) deviates from i, then firms begin to follow the

punishment path described by .

If a firm deviates from its own punishment path, its

punishment path is reimposed from the beginning.

Given a penal code,

iet & c (O,i)be the flrm's discount factor and let V3(r1) =

level penal code

Lambson (1987) proved for symmetric Bertrand games (and for a very general

class of rationing rules) that if an optional penal code exists then a security level penal
code is credible, implying that optimal penal codes are security level penal codes. This

result does p hold in all asymmetric Bertrand games, but it is true that the largest firm
can always be driven to its security level, Namely, Theorem 2.1 isa special case of a

result found in Lambson (199l).

IbstortrtmZl: If i-is an optimal penal code and k = maxk then V1() = V.
To see why it may not be credible to threaten to drive smaller firms to their
security levels, consider a very small firm with a security level close to zero. To hold
such a flrm to its security level, all firms would have to charge prices close to marginal

cost and hence garner profits close to zero. Large firms with high security levels may

find it in their best interest to refuse to go through with the punishment. Thus

Lmbson (1987) proof that optimal penal codes are security level penal codes does not
generalize from symmetric Bertrand games. However, Lambson (1991) establishes that

security level penal codes are credible if firms' capacities are not too different.
Furthermore, given the Levitan-Shubik mechanism, if

its security level, security level penal codes provide a bound on the severtty of

punishments and hence an upper bound on the maximal level of collusion,

Empirical Research Strategy

Explicit and implicit in the dynamic collusion that is modeled above are various

conditions that can be examined for empirical consistency. Two concern us here:

(i)

Each colluding firm must grin more profits from the collusion than it could

guarantee for itself in isolation, In other words, each firm share of collusive profits
must exceed its one-period se-curity ievel. Though this may seem a very weak condition,

and thus easily consistent with the data, we found it unsatisfied in some cases for the
largest firms under 'base-case "parameterization.
(2)

Each colluding firm must gain at least as much profit from supporting the

collusive pricing continuously than by 'defecting "and then being 'kunished "according to

the penal code governing the collusion. In other words, under security-level penal codes,
condition (2.2) must hotd, in which the ieft-hand side measures the one-period increment

over collusive profits from a firm defection, and the right-hand side measures the
discounted value of the indefinite sacrifice of collusive profits under punishment.

Since the discount factors are not directly observable, these equations can be sized
up against the data in two equivalent ways. 'Realistic "discount factors can be assumed,
and the equations can be examined directly by measuring other variables and parameters

as described in Section 4. Or the conditions can be Thaintained "as equations and solved

S

for the discount factors that would support such a maintained hypothesis. These implied

discount factors can then be evaluated for lheir realism. One advantage of lhe second
approach is its capacity for meaningful reinterpretation. The model implicitly identifies a
'keriod with the length of time it takes for rivals to detect a given firm S defection from
the collusion;7 discount factors that seem realistically to be too low correspond precisely

to 'defection-possibility periods "that seem too long to believe that an auto maker could
really hide underpricing and overproduction from its rivals.

Voluntary Restraint Arrangements that constrain the capacity of some firms will
reduce both (assuming a fixed collusive price): the temptation of each firm to defect
from the collusion o± the profits sacrificed under punishment (that is, the punishment
cost) that follows defection. In other words, the advent of VRAs, ceteris paribus, will

reduce both the left-hand and right-hand sides of condition (2.2); the attenuation of
VRAs wilt raise both sides. Collusive prices' itt endogenously adjust. An illustration of
the component parts of condition (2.2)

is

given in table 3.1. Even though other things

are not equal across regimes, it is interesting that the respective sides of (2.2) change in
the implied direction 75 percent of the time for large U.S. firms.

A voluntary restraint arrangement can be interpreted as a policy to reduce the
capacity avaitable to the firms 'which are bound by the arrangement. The effects of
imposing a VRA can thus be storied by analyzing the effects of changes in the firms'

capacities, Two questions are central. First, how does the arrangement affect the firms'
ability to collude? Second, how does the arrangement affect the collusive profits of the
varsous firms?

Consider an arrangement that affects only one firm, say j. Instead of being

aisowed to sell up to k. firm j

is

constrained to sell no more than 5) <k1. This has two

effects on collusion. First, the ability of firm j to punish the other firms is reduced; that

is, the security levels of the other firms tend to rise. This decreases the right hand side

of (22) for all i and a fixed collusive price, p. This effect tends to work ggjns
collusion, so only less profitable colibsive prices can be sustained. The second effect, on
the other hand, words f.ctL collusion; firm j finds it less profitable to cheat on a collusive

agreoment. In the absence of the restraint agreement, firm j would receive srp,...p) =
(o-c)k if it deviated optimally from the collusive agreement. With the VRA in place,

however, it can only receive r,...,p)= @-c)v. Hence the demand allocation in
collusion can give less output to firm i and more to the other firms. This makes it more
attractive to the other firms to abide by the agreement so more profitable collusive
prices are sustainable. Nothing can be said about which effect will dominate.

To calibrate the model and perform the tests described above, we sought three

data sets, corresponding tb regimes before, during, and after the YRA with Japan. The
regimes are distinguished from each other in the model by the way the VRA constrains
the capacity of Japanese firms to defect from the collusion and to punish the other
defectors. Thus in empirical calibration, we sought a configuration that allowed capacity
to differ across regimes, yet that forced other fundamental exogenous variables (demand

curves, costs) to remain stationary within regimes, Cyclically was purged from the data
to the degree that stationarity was achieved. This procedure required some creative

to

aggregation over time, since the inner boundaries of the regimes needed also to

represent the advent and attenuation of the VRA.

To obtain a 're-VRA data set9, we averaged passenger car figures for 1979,
1980, and 19811. This had the advantage of combining acknowledged 'good 'and "cad

periods for the U.S. industry, and of creating a 1979-811 average that was remarkably
similar in the aggregate (except capacity) to data for 198111 through 1985, which we used

for our 'hsid-VRA "measures, and to data for 1986 through 1989, which we used for our

'ost-VRA "measures. The similarity encompassed not only quantities and parameters of
the demand curves, but also a form of approximate stationarity for disaggregated prices

by firm.'° The resulting data and parameters are recorded in Table 4.1
The most difficult challenge was to calibrate tirm-by-firm capacity for each of the

three regimes, Explicit firm-by-firm data are confldential, Available aggregates for the
industry as a whole have conceptual problems (e.g., many measure all motor vehicles, not

just passenger cars) and questionable accuracy (e.g., several are simple linked peaks of

production series). For the pre-VRA and mid-VRA regimes, we relied instead on
USITC (1980, l985a) for industry-level capacity, K', and then allocated K among six

U.S. and Japanese 'firms'
General Motors (GM)
Ford
Chrysler
Toyota
Nissan

Honda
Production data for the U.S. firms was collected for each of the years 1969 through 1985
from MYMA (1989), Wards (1984, 1986, 1988) and AN (1985). A graphical smoothing
11

method was used to oalcuiate a measure we call 'bverage peak produotion 'for eaoh U.S.
firm for each year during the entire period (the measure was aiways greater than or

equal to actual production). By assuming thst the ratio of 'average peak produotion "to
oapaoity was identioai aoross U.S. firms15, we were abie to allocate reoorded industry

capaoity among them aooording to time trends in their peak produotion figures. For the
post-VRA regime we relied on Federal Reserve System (1990) for the growth rates of
aggregate capacity for passenger cars and light trucks, appiying these rates successively to

our i985 figure for keal "passenger car capacity.
tf only large U.S. firms are hypothesized to collude, only data in their capacities

are necessary. if, in addition, large Japanese firms are hypothesized to collude then data
on their capacities to import are also necessary. Capacity for imports was initially hard

to conceive. In an extreme view, all global production could be dumped into the U.S.
market--more than 20 million vehicles a year outside the United States. We resolved
instead to try something less extreme and consistent with our underlying model. For the
pre-VRA period, we assumed that a relevant measure of capacity utilization for the
Japanese firms selling imports was an interpolation between capacity utilization rates for

American Motors 'and Volkswagen North American operations and for Chrysler,
calculated as above. Since Japanese firm sales tended to fall between the two, this
reflected a reasonable posture that capacity utilization rates be identical for identically
sized firms, For the mid-VRA period, we assumed that Japanese firm import capacity
'was actual imports, being constralned by the VRA. For the post-VRA regime Japanese
flrm capacity in the North American market was constructed by summing: (i) published

i2

accounts of North American capacity built by Toyota, Nissan, and Honda during 1986-89;

and (ii) ongoing VRA allotments for each firm, even when not binding. We emphasize
that these calculations of import capacity do not enter our tests of hypothesized collusion
among large U.S. firms alone.

Calculated capacities and capacity utilization rates based on these procedures are

recorded in Table 4.2.
5. Empirical Calibration and Results

All theories of collusion that assume the usual form of individual rationality

necessarily require that each firm receive collusive profits that are at least as large as its
security level, that is, each firm must receive profits at least as large as the profits that it

can guarantee for itself independently of the actions of the other firms. Of course, if
punishments are never triggered there is no direct way to observe firms' security levels.
If, however, linear demand is assumed and the Levitan-Shubik rationing rule adopted,
security levels can be deduced. Specifically, under the Levitan-Shubik rationing rule firm

i has a guaranteed residual demand given by

(5,1) d(p) = max [0, a - bp - K]
where p is firm i

price and Km

represents the capacity of i competitors. If the

firm b own capacity constraint is not binding, then its profit from servicing its residual

demand curve can be expressed as

(5.2) (p) = (p-c)

max [0, (a-bp-K)],

13

which, if a-bc-K; taO, it maximizes when price is p =

(a

hc -

K/2b, If its capacity

constraint is binding when it services its residual demand curve by charging p, that is if
Is1

(a

- bc - K)12, then it maximizes profits from its residual demand curve by charging

p** = (a-k1-K1)/b, that is, by charging the price such that its capacity is exactly
demanded. Thus, firm Lb one-period security level is

(i3)

= (a-bc-K)2/4b
=0
(a-bc-K1-k1)(k,/b)

if Is1 ta (a-bc-K,)12 and a-bc-K, taO

ifk ta(a-bc-K1)12 and a-bc-K,

if k1

(a-bc-K1)/2,

As discussed in section 4, each regime is treated scparately, The data themsetves

cstabhsh a point on the demand curve. Assuming linearity, the demand curve is then

comtetety determined by its elasticity. The demand curve and the data on firm
capacity, in tum, determine the security levels of the firms through (53). The data also
provide the profits of the firms. The theoretical requirement that all the firms 'collusive
profits exceed their security levels puts a restriction on which demand elasticities are

consistent with both the data and the theory. The ranges of consistent elasticities are in

Tabie 5. l These ranges depend on very little more than linearity: given linearity, ny
model satisfying a weak form of individual rationality will imply these restrictions.

Calculations were made for each of the three regimes under three different
assumptions pertaining to market structUre, The three assumptions were, respectively,

(1) that alt six of the major automobile cocrations were colluding, (2) that all three of
the major US, automobile corporations were coituding, and (3) that only General

14

Motors and Ford were colluding. Firms that were assumed not to be colluding were

assumed not to be threatening to use any

excess

capacity in punishing a deviate colluder;

hence, the result of dropping a colluder is a reduction in K for each remaining
colluder, ° A priori, the case for the first assumption seems strongest in the pre-VRA

and post-VRA episodes; during the VRA episode the Japanese firms were constrained

by the VRA 's and hence had limited ability to expand output to punish deviation (as well

as limited ability to expand output to deviate). if one takes the view that the Japanese
in the pre-YRA and/or post-VRA period were striving to penetrate the U.S. market,
making them unlikely conspirators in any collusive agreement, then assumption 2 might

seem most reasonable, Finally, if one believes that the tenuous financial condition of
Chrysler during some episodes would have made it an unreliable partner in collusion,
assumption 3 might seem most reasonable.

Given the ranges of elasticities in Table 5.l,one can use (2.2) to consider whether
the data are broadly consistent with security level penal codes. If security level penal
codes are

employed, then V) = i-/(t- J) where J is defined in (5.3). Deviation from

the high collusive price is optimally accomplished by undercutting one co-conspirators

and producing up to capacity; hence 5r = (p-c)k. Finally, if firms maximize joint profits
subject to (2.2) and if the nionopoly price is not sustainable then (2.2) holds with
equalIty, thus determining J.
The collusive profit s(f;p,..., p)is, by assumption, what is observed in the data.

Hence, iming that (2.2) holds with equality for each colluding firm (i.e., maintaining
that collusion

exist, that it maximizes joinl profits, and that security level

15

punishments are credible for all firms) and summing (2.2) over colluding firms, one can
solve for the 'bverage "discount factor, 3, implied by the data and the model 's

assumptions. The discount factors for the extremes of the elasticity ranges for each

regime and each market structure assumption are in Table 5.2.
These data-consistent, model-consistent average discount factors seem on balance

much too low to be believable. Even the most plausible (that is, the largest) of these
discount factors correspond to 'defection-possibility periods "that are six to eighteen
months in length, depending on firms 'rates of time preference.

It is hard to believe that

auto rivals v.outd remain passive in the face of significantly increased sales by a defector

for this long a period before detecting the 'Infraction. "and responding to it. Smaller
discount factors, of course, correspond to even longer and mere incredible defection
periods.

However, these discount factors are derived assuming that all firms can credibly

be driven to their security levels, This assumption is i implied by the theory, which
only guarantees that the iatgest firm can be so severely punished and, hence, that (2.2)
holds with equality only for GM. Table 5.3 contains the discount factors for GM given
the exrremes of the elasticity ranges for each regime and each market structure
assumption. H In every case, GM 'h implied discount factor approaches one as the

elasticity of demand approaches the lower bound of the consistent elasticity ranges

exhibited in Table Si. Elasticities close to those lower bounds (that is, within about .01)
correspond to detection periods of a fe'.v months or Iess '.vith the length of the detection

period approaching rem as the elasticity approaches the tower bound. Thus for the

i6

reader who accepts the lower elasticity bounds as reasonable (for a market structure
assumpteon that he or she also considers reasonable) the data are broadly consistent with
the theory.

gglusio
The above model of dynamic imperfect competition in an asymmetric Bertrand

oligopoly can be construed as broadly consistent with data on the firms producing

passenger cars for the U.S. market between 1979 and 1989. One conclusions on this
point will depend on what he or she believes about automobile demand elasticity and
market structure,

Without reference to any particular theory, and requiring only linearity and a
minimal notion of individual rationality, the data imply that automobile demand
elasticities fell somewhere between 0.17 and 7.05 during the sample period (see Table

5.1). This is, no doubt, a large range. On the other hand, it contains any reasonable .

wQa opinion on what automobile demand elasticities were without containing numbers
above the single digits. The method of data construction in no way required this
outcome in advance, so some confidence in this method is justified.

Further restrictions on the demand elasticity imposed by the theory (along with

the belief that it would take no more than a few months, at the very most, for firms to
detect deviation from collusion) lead one to focus on the lower end of the elasticity
ranges implied by linearity and individual rationality. Whether one finds the model
consistent weth the data then depends on what one believes about demand elasticities

and market structure. For example, if one believes that the elasticity of automobile

17

demand is about one, Table 5.1 suggests that in the PreGTBA and VRA regimes oniy

GM and Ford were able to ooliude and the ooliusion broke down in the Fost-YRA
regime. This is oonsistent with the story that Chrysler S tenuous financial oondition made
it an untrustworthy partner throughout the eighties, that Japanese firms esohewed

ooitusion in the Fre-VRA regime as they attempted to penetrate the American market
and were prevented from being oollusive partners by trade restraints during the VRA
regime, and that all firms lost the ability to ooliude in the oompetitive environment

foilowing the VRA as Japanese capacity in the United States became significant. By
contrast, if one is willing to entertain lower automobile demand elasticities, the data are
consistent 'with even larger automobile cartels.

This assumption would make sense if peaks represented surges of aggregate
demand that took all colluding producers by surprise, and allowed all to produce
temporarily at levels comparably close to full capacity.

K1 was calculated as the sum of the capacities of the colluders and the sales of the
noncolluders,

14. GM discount factor is a U-shaped function of the elasticity. Changing the
elasticity means rotating the demand curve through the observed (collusive) point.
Increasing elasticity thus reduces (increases) profitability to the left (right) of the
observed point. At low (high) elasticities optimal deviation from marginal cost
pricing occurs at prices above (below) the observed point so at low (high)
elasticities the security level falls (rises) as elasticity increases. The result is a Ushaped function with the maximum security level (and hence the maximum
discount factor) in the consistent range occurring at one (or both) of the end
points.
