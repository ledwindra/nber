    "abstract": "\n\nTransferring Fortran subroutines from one manufacturer' s machine to another, or from one operating system to another, puts certain constraints on the construction of the Fortran statements that are used in the subroutines. The reliable performance of mathematical software should be unaffected by the host environment in which the software is used or by the compiler from which the cod eis generated. In short, the reliable performance of the algorithm is to be independent of the computing environment in which it is run. The subroutines of ROSEPACK (Robust Statistics Estimation Package) are Fortran IV source code designed to be semi-portable where semi-portable is defined to mean transportable with minimum change. *This paper described the guidelines by which ROSEPACK subroutines were written.\n\n",

Kirsch for his helpful suggestions on documentation of subroutines, John Dennis, Jim Ferris, David Gay David Hoaglin and Gerald Ruderman for their constructive criticism of this document, and Karen Glennon for her careful typing of the manuscript.\n\n\n"
