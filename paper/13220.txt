ABSTRACT
This essay reviews the family of models that seek to provide aggregate risk based explanations for
the empirically observed equity premium. Theories based on non-expected utility preference structures,
limited financial market participation, model uncertainty and the small probability of enormous losses
are detailed. We impose the additional requirements that candidate models yield consistent inter temporal
portfolio choice and that a representative agent can be constructed which is independent of the underlying
heterogeneous economy's initial wealth distribution. While many models are able to replicate a wide
variety of financial statistics including the premium, few satisfy these latter criteria as well.

Introduction:
Mehra and Prescott (1985) demonstrated that the empirical equity
premium, (the return earned on a well-diversified “market portfolio” in excess of
that earned by a risk-free T-bill), is an order of magnitude greater than can be
rationalized as a premium for bearing non-diversifiable risk in the context of the
standard neoclassical representative agent paradigm of financial economics1.
Inevitably, the subsequent literature has principally focused on modifying the
standard paradigm to generate much larger non-diversifiable premia2. As a
companion exercise, these efforts have adopted an ancillary goal of replicating
the risk free rate, rate of return volatilities, return autocorrelations, return cross
correlations, and return correlations with consumption growth. In this chapter,
we review this literature, which falls into four broad categories:
1. Preference based theories: These theories seek to modify preferences so
that the agent is acutely sensitive in some way to poor consumption outcomes.
Outcomes may be ‘poor’ in either an absolute sense or in a relative sense vis-à-vis
some external benchmark, as in the habit formation literature. Illustrations
sometimes require that agent preferences be defined over objects directly
reflective of the agent’s portfolio experience, such as his recent gains or losses.
While these behavioural formulations lie outside the standard expected utility
construct, axiomatic foundations are nevertheless sometimes available. Part 1 of
this essay focuses on these theories.3

The following chapter (Mehra and Prescott (2007)) surveys the literature on non-risk based
explanations of the equity premium.
2
Mehra and Prescott (1985) can match the premium with a very high CRRA. Alternatively, we
can view the literature as seeking to match the premium (and other financial quantities) with a
low CRRA.

Zin (1991), and Ferson and Constantinides (1991).

2. Disaster scenarios: Researchers have also explored models where utility
is of the standard CRRA variety, yet in which the worst outcomes are much
more disastrous than the worst cases possible in a standard Mehra and Prescott
(1985) context. Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006), in particular, fall into this
category4. Literatures 1 and 2 are dual to one another: either agents in the model
must effectively be very sensitive to bad outcomes, or it is the outcomes
themselves that must be very bad.
3. Trading frictions: Under either of the categories above, the premium will
still be counterfactually small if agents can somehow insure against their worst
consumption outcomes. Since the standard Mehra and Prescott (1985)
representative agent construct is implicitly one of complete markets, perfect
insurance opportunities are available in that context. Furthermore, for models
parameterized to the per capita aggregate consumption process of the U.S.
economy, agents do not find themselves in situations of extreme consumption risk.
There must then be added features to the model, which deny at least some of the
agents with risky consumption profiles access to a full set of state claims.
Incomplete markets (whether in the form of restricted financial market
participation for some agents or in the form of allowing trade in only a restricted
set of assets) and collateral constraints are possibilities that have been explored.5

4. Model Uncertainty: Nearly all the asset pricing literature presumes
rational expectations; the relevant agents in the economy know the true
probability distributions governing the relevant state variables: dividends, wages,
etc. The uncertainty literature presumes that this is not the case; it thereby
introduces another source of uncertainty, a feature that gives rise to an
additional risk premium for equity securities. Barrillas et al. (2006) and
Weitzman (2006) are cases in point.
We do not address this literature in full detail, as many of these topics are
dealt with in specific chapters of the present volume. Category 3, in particular, is
thoroughly considered in the essays by George Constantinides, and by John
Heaton and Deborah Lucas, particularly as regards classical incompleteness (too
few securities are traded). 8 We thus consider only the impact of borrowing
constraints. Loss aversion and narrow framing is carefully considered in the
Barberis and Huang chapter.9 As it constitutes a preference related modification,
we consider it in the present chapter but in an abbreviated form. As a field of
study, model uncertainty as applied to the premium is in its infancy. While
potentially very fruitful, the literature is small and our discussion will be
correspondingly brief. Most research has followed the preference route and this is
the literature that we will emphasize.10 Whenever possible, we cast the discussion
within the original Mehra and Prescott (1985) discrete time representative agent
setting.

1. Alternative Preference Structures
1.1 Preliminaries
The focus of this section is to assess the extent to which plausible
preference structures alone can rationalize the basic stylized facts as they relate
to asset returns and the equity premium. The analysis in the previous chapter
shows that the isoelastic CRRA preferences used in Mehra and Prescott (1985)
can be made consistent with the observed equity premium only if the coefficient
of relative risk aversion is implausibly large.
Before proceeding with our discussion of alternative preference structures,
we examine in detail some especially attractive features of the CRRA class, which
makes it the “preference function of choice” in modern finance and
macroeconomics. These features, while desirable in their own right for logical or
empirical reasons, also constitute common properties that any reasonable
preference specification should display.
(i) Equilibrium Return Stationarity
CRRA preferences result in a stationary equilibrium return process. This
property is readily demonstrated in the context of the Mehra and Prescott (1985)
model, where both the equity return and the return on the risk free asset follow
stationary processes, despite the fact that the level of output in the economy is
growing over time and hence is itself non stationary.11 This is consistent with the
statistical evidence on the time series of asset returns over the past 100 years:
asset returns appear to be stationary, although the level of stock prices and the

magnitude of aggregate dividends have grown enormously. Any serious preference
structure should yield equilibrium return series with this feature.
(ii) Aggregation
Actual asset prices are formed via the trading behavior of large numbers of
heterogeneous investors as each attempts to maintain his individual optimal
portfolio composition, given his information on the future distribution of returns.
Equilibria in such economies are difficult to characterize.
If financial markets are competitive and complete, and agent preferences
are expected utility, there will in general, exist, by construction, a representative
(single agent) economy with the same aggregate consumption series as the
heterogeneous agent economy and the same asset price functions. These
economies are comparatively easy to analyze. In addition, if the representative
agent can be constructed in a manner that is independent of the underlying
heterogeneous agent economy’s initial wealth distribution, we say the economy
displays aggregation.
Aggregation (vis-a-vis the existence of a representative agent) is the
stronger, more restrictive and more desirable property. It implies that assets may
be priced in the representative agent economy without knowledge of the wealth
distribution in the underlying heterogeneous agent counterpart. Under
aggregation, results derived in the representative agent economy are general and
robust. Aggregation also permits the use of the representative agent for welfare
comparisons.12In what follows, we provide a brief description of how the
representative agent is constructed and then point out the additional structure
imposed by aggregation.

12

Suppose, alternatively, that aggregation fails. Then each possible initial wealth distribution,
via its associated representative agent, will display its own asset pricing characteristics. No
general statements may be made.

Consider an exchange economy of k = 1, 2, . . . K agents. We make the
following notational identifications: c kt represents agent k’s period t consumption,
while q et and q bt , respectively, denote the period t prices of the equity and one
period risk free security. The period t price of a state claim to one unit of
consumption in period t+j, if state ! occurs, is denoted by q !t, j . By analogy, the
corresponding period t desired holdings of these securities by agent k are,
k b,k
respectively, ze,
, zt and z!,k
. For notational simplicity, we have suppressed the
t

dependence of these quantities and prices on the period t state. With this
notation in mind, the period t decision problem faced by an arbitrary agent k is:

The assumption that bonds are in zero net supply is not innocuous, although it is
customary in the literature. In particular, it allows representative agent models to match the risk
free rate more easily. For a recent perspective, see Gomes and Michaelides (2006).

Under this equivalence, the ‘representative agent’ is a stand in for the
weighted average of the economy’s members.
As we have noted, the weights and thus the asset price series itself will, in
general, depend on the initial wealth distribution. This is an enormously
complicating feature as it suggests that asset prices in any period are in
significant ways dependent on wealth distributions many years previously. If all
agents in the decentralized multi-agent economy have preferences of the CRRA

type, however, the weights !1, . . . , !K

} will be independent of the initial wealth

distribution, a fact that makes the use of representative agent models for asset
pricing exercises more plausible. More formally, aggregation requires that the
period utility function must either be of the form,
u(c t ) = !e

" k ct

#

or u(c t ) =

unique to agent k. To emphasize this point again, even if the individual
preferences assume neither of these forms, (but are still expected utility) there
will continue to exist a representative agent whose preferences are the weighted
average of the individual agent preferences. However, they cannot be used to
make any statements about ‘off equilibrium’ paths.15
(iii) Time consistent planning.
Time consistency implies that the optimal future contingent portfolio
decisions made at t = 0 remain the optimal decisions even as uncertainty resolves
and intermediate consumption is experienced.
When considering multi-period decision problems, time consistency is a
natural property to propose. In its absence, one would observe portfolio
15

Within the context of seeking to replicate the equity premium, the statement is intended to
remind the reader that, without aggregation, the asset pricing properties may become unique to
the particular underlying initial wealth distribution. As a result, the same asset pricing results
may not apply across various initial wealth distributions and associated representative agents. No
statements of any generality can be made.

rebalancing not motivated by any event or information flow but rather simply
motivated by the (unobservable) changes in the investor’s preference ordering as
time passed. Asset trades would be motivated by endogenous and unobservable
preference characteristics, and would thus be mysterious and unexplainable.
To understand the utility restrictions that time consistency imposes, let us
consider a two period context, t = 0, 1, where any one of s ! S possible states
may occur next period. Denote by c1(s) the investor’s consumption at date t = 1
contingent on state “s” occurring. Johnsen and Donaldson (1985) demonstrate
that if the overall (both periods’ consumption) utility function is to exhibit time
consistent planning, there must exist continuous and monotone increasing
functions f( ) and {u s ( ) : s ! S} such that

u(c0, c1(s) : s ! S) = f(c0, u s(c0, c1(s)) : s ! S)
where us (c0, c1 (s)) is the state s contingent utility function. The recursive
preference structure of Kreps and Porteus (1978), which makes explicit the
preference for the timing of uncertainty resolution, is closely related. Note that
under this formulation, preferences in any future state ŝ may be conditioned on
consumption today c0, but not on consumption planned for states s! " ŝ that, de
facto, have not occurred. In effect, the utility function must be of a form such
that utility representations in future states can be recursively nested as
individual arguments of the overall utility function, a condition fulfilled by the
expected utility representation. We are thus, assuredly, in a time consistent
planning context under the expected utility assumption.16

16

Time consistent planning is satisfied in the Mehra and Prescott (1985) setup, because they
assume an expected utility preference representation, in addition to the CRRA period utility
specification.

11

1.2 Separating Time and Risk Preferences:
One restriction imposed by the CRRA class of preferences is that the
coefficient of risk aversion is rigidly linked to the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution. One is the reciprocal of the other. If an individual is averse to
variation of consumption across different states at a particular point of time, then
this feature implies he will be averse to consumption variation over time as well.
Since, on average, consumption is growing over time, the agents in the Mehra
and Prescott (1985) setup have little incentive to save. The demand for bonds is
low and as a consequence the risk-free rate is counterfactually high.
We illustrate this in the context of a deterministic two period model where
agents have preferences of the form

u(c, !) =

c1"!
,

and solve the following problem

max u(c0, !) + " u(c1, !)

As ! ! " (greater CRRA), (c0 c1 ) ! 1 ; the agent wishes for an extremely
smooth consumption profile across time, a preference that is maintained under
uncertainty. In a setting without uncertainty, this effectively means that the
agent dislikes growth in his intertemporal consumption profile. In an asset
pricing environment in which the representative agent’s consumption is growing

12

exogenously through time (in order that it be properly calibrated), the agent will
thus demand a very high rate of return in order to hold securities, the very
possession of which increases his intertemporal consumption discrepancy. From
the perspective of intertemporal consumption smoothing, the parameter 1 / ! is
referred to as the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (hereafter EIS). While
indeed increasing the premium, increasing the CRRA has the counterfactual
consequence of increasing mean returns to a level much in excess of what is
observed, especially in the case of the risk free security.
In order to confirm these effects, let us explore the mean returns and
volatilities for a number of CRRAs in the context of the basic Mehra and
Prescott (1985) model and calibration17.

From Table 1 there is no doubt that increasing risk aversion increases the
equilibrium equity premium: as the agent increasingly dislikes consumption
variation of any sort, he must be paid an increasing premium in order to be

(2007)).

willing to hold risky securities in preference to risk free ones. It also improves
the volatilities of the respective return series. But the cost in other
counterfactuals is very great. In particular, even as the CRRA is not yet absurdly
large ( ! = 9), the mean equity and risk free returns become much too high at,
respectively, 18.25% and 15.93% annualized. This is a direct consequence of the
single preference parameter construct: in order to induce the representative agent
to hold either type of security – an action that reduces the extent of his inter
temporal consumption smoothing – security prices must fall to very low levels.
Equivalently, the returns on all types of securities must be very high.18

There is no a priori reason that the desire to smooth consumption across
states within a period and the desire to smooth consumption inter temporally
should be tightly bound together. After all, one may speak of inter temporal
consumption smoothing in a no-risk environment (in a context, say, of
motivating savings behaviour), and one may equally well speak of risk aversion in
an uncertain, atemporal environment. The situation considered previously
requires that the same parameter describe the extent of sensitivity to both of
these variations. Empirical studies seem to suggest, in fact, that investors are
more desirous of a smooth inter temporal consumption stream than they are of
an atemporal risk free environment.

Mehra and Prescott’s (1985) calibration admits a small degree of negative autocorrelation in
the growth rate of consumption. Azeredo (2007) argues that the Mehra and Prescott (1985)
consumption autocorrelation estimates may be due to consumption data mismeasurement prior to
1929, and that mild positive autocorrelation is more accurate. If the stochastic process governing
the growth rate of consumption is positively serial correlated, then as the risk-aversion increases
progressively, the equity premium eventually declines and turns negative .The earlier assertion
that a higher CRRA leads to a larger premium is therefore consumption process specific. The
consumption process underlying most Tables and model evaluations in this survey, however, is
that of Mehra and Prescott (1985) in order to benchmark a basis of comparison.
18

1.3 Separating Risk and Time Preferences
Epstein and Zin (1989, 1991, 2001) and Kreps and Porteus (1978) have
emphasized a class of non expected utility preferences that they term
“Generalized Expected Utility” (GEU) which allows independent specification of
the coefficient of risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.19
These preferences separate time and risk preferences in a way that preserves the
time consistency property of the previous section.20
The basic notions involved in separating time and risk preferences are
roughly summarized as follows: first characterize preferences over riskless
consumption sequences (c t ) with a Koopmans (1960) time aggregation V( )
where
(1)

U(tc)=V(u(c t ),U(t+1c)). 21,22

19

This preference construct has as its intellectual antecedents the time consistent recursive
preference structures of Kreps and Porteus (1978) and Johnsen and Donaldson (1985), and the
Chew ((1983), (1989)) and Dekel (1986) preference generalization, which allows the independence
assumption of classical expected utility to be relaxed. The latter is important for at least two
reasons. First, there are widely reported violations of independence in the experimental
literature; the Allais (1979) paradox is perhaps the most celebrated example. Second, this
generalization has permitted the creation of preference structures that allow greater utility weight
on bad outcomes than would arise in an expected utility context; see, in particular, Gul (1991).
Not only is there empirical support for the hypothesis of high sensitivity to bad outcomes, but it
is also a plausible feature that allows consumption based asset pricing models to better replicate
the premium. The reader is directed Backus et al. (2004) for an elegant and detailed discussion of
this preference class.
20

More recently, Kihlstrom (2007) proposes an alternative dynamic portfolio choice model,
which also separates time and risk preferences. At each point in time, investors maximize the
expectation of present and future consumption. Consistent planning is preserved by having the
agents ‘choose the best plan among those he will actually follow’ (Strotz (1956)).
21

We use the same notation as Backus et al. (2004) and Johnson and Donaldson (1985). See the
former study for a careful discussion of all the issues involves.

15

In the above expression, U( ) is the overall utility representation, c t is the period
t consumption, u( ) is the period utility function, and (t c) denotes a continuous
consumption sequence (c t,c t+1...) .This framework is then generalized to evaluate
uncertain consumption sequences essentially by replacing the second argument in
V(,) by the period t certainty equivalent of the probability distribution over all
possible consumption continuations. The resultant class of recursive preferences
may be notationally characterized as

(2)

Ut =V(u(c t ),µt(Ut+1 )) ,

where µt () describes the certainty equivalent function based on the conditional
probability distribution over consumption sequences beginning in period t+1.
Such preferences are dynamically consistent. If the certainty equivalent is
obtained via expected utility, the preferences fall into the Kreps and Porteus
(1978) family. If it is obtained via a more general risk aggregator of the ChewDeckel class (e.g., disappointment aversion risk preferences to be considered
shortly), the preferences are said to be of the more general Epstein and Zin
(1989) variety. These latter preferences have axiomatic underpinnings as well.
In their most basic analysis, Epstein and Zin explore the CES-like
specialized preference ordering that is detailed below:

,
22

Preferences over deterministic consumption sequences which have the form (1) satisfy three
reasonable properties (by construction): (i) history independence (preferences over consumption
sequences (c t ) do not depend on prior consumption); (ii)future independence (preferences for
period t consumption,

c t are independent of future consumption (t+1c) and (iii) stationarity

(preferences are the same at all dates).

a fact that suggests we may unambiguously view the parameter ! of (3) – (4) as
the CRRA (Epstein and Zin (1989) provide a more formal argument). Similarly,
as the parameter ! becomes smaller, the agent becomes less willing to substitute
utility, and thus consumption, intertemporally. The parameter ! can be viewed
as the agent’s customary time preference parameter.

17

Weil (1989) uses these preferences in a setting otherwise identical to that
of Mehra and Prescott (1985) to compute the resultant premium. Even as
specialized to the Epstein-Zin (1989) preference structure, Weil (1989)
demonstrates that the Mehra and Prescott (1985) solution for the equilibrium
price functions, q e (Yt, x i ) = !iYt and q b (Yt, x i ) = ! i still applies with the proviso
that the constants !i, " i now must satisfy a system of non-linear equations.
Using an endowment process {Yt} otherwise identical to that of Mehra and
Prescott (1985), Weil (1989) obtains the results detailed in Table 2.
It is readily apparent that the Epstein-Zin preference construct can, per
se, provide some progress toward the equity premium puzzle resolution, but not
a complete resolution. In particular, if the CRRA is set at 45 and ! at .1, then a
reasonable match to the data (mean-values) is obtained. But if a much more
reasonable CRRA of 1 is hypothesized, the premium is a scant .45% while the
mean risk free rate is 25%.23 Both of these features are counterfactual. As Weil
(1989) argues, generalizing preferences in the direction of Epstein and Zin (1989)
seems only to deepen the puzzle: (1) in abstract economies such as Mehra and
Prescott’s (1985), calibrated to observed per capita income dynamics (Ct = Yt ) ,
there is insufficient consumption growth risk to justify a substantial premium
unless agents are implausibly risk averse. (2) Furthermore, per capital
consumption

23

Consistent with these findings yet using a very different methodological perspective,
Kocherlakota (1990) demonstrates that when the growth rate of consumption is i.i.d. (an
assumption with substantial empirical support) asset pricing models which separate the CRRA
and the EIS as per (1) – (4) have no more explanatory power in empirical tests than those
preferences for which these parameters coincide as in the standard Mehra and Prescott (1985)
paradigm. Weil (1989) also observes that the risk premium is independent of the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution in the i.i.d. case. It must thus have the same magnitude as in the time
additive, expected utility case of Mehra and Prescott (1985)(again for i.i.d. consumption growth).
Kihlstrom’s (2007) generalization also delivers a low premium in the i.i.d. case but for different
reasons: existence of equilibrium places severe upper bounds on the risk aversion measure.

(i) This is Table 1 of Weil (1989).

growth is too high (μ = 1.8%) for the equilibrium risk free rate to be low, when
agents are averse to intertemporal consumption substitution to the extent
observed. In hindsight, these results are not entirely surprising. Even under
Epstein-Zin (1989, 1991) preferences, there is one parameter alone, ! , which is
given the entire role of characterizing the degree of risk aversion. Furthermore,
by separating time and risk preferences, their structure tends to strengthen the
influence of the intertemporal substitution parameter 1/ ! . As a result, agents
must once again be offered a counterfactually high risk free rate in order to
19

induce them to save more in an environment when mean consumption growth is
exogenously fixed at 1.8%. Note that Weil’s findings do not disqualify the entire
Epstein-Zin family since other approaches to obtaining certainty equivalents may
apply. They do suggest, however, that the difficulty may be in separating time
and risk preferences where the agent does not need to be too risk averse to match
the data.
Epstein-Zin preference constructs have been employed more successfully
by Bansal and Yaron (2004) in a richer economic environment. These authors
postulate processes on consumption growth and the dividend which are distinct
but share a small, but highly persistent time varying expected growth
component. The resultant ‘long run consumption risk’ is specially onerous for
Epstein-Zin style representative agents who desire an early resolution of
uncertainty. This latter feature demands a preference specification where the
CRRA>(1/EIS), a precondition that the Bansal and Yaron (2004) calibration
easily satisfies. For the ! = 10 and " = 1.5 case, they are able to replicate all the
stylized facts quite well: Ere = 6.84%, Erf = .93%, ! = 18.65% and !r = .57%.

f

(Table 4 in Bansal and Yaron (2004)).24 That the persistent growth component is
small lends credibility to their basic consumption growth hypothesis, as it is very
difficult, empirically, to distinguish this possibility from the more customary i.i.d.

24

Why the presence of long run consumption risk should be an especially important factor in the
Epstein and Zin preference context is more apparent if we examine the corresponding process on
the marginal rate of substitution,

U1 (c t+1 )

If γ =1/4, the standard power utility case, the expression collapses whereby only consumption

20

consumption growth assumption. While an EIS as high as 1.5 is disputable, there
is no prevailing consensus estimate of this quantity, even as regards to it being
greater, equal to, or less than one.
We view Bansal and Yaron (2004), its predecessors and successors, as
important for a number of reasons.25 First and foremost, it emphasizes the
importance of long run growth variation for the asset pricing literature. Their
paper also suggests that a full resolution of the equity premium puzzle may
demand an improved understanding not only of investor preference structures,
but also of the long run statistical characteristics of the principal aggregate
macro series.
More recently, Kallenbrunner and Lochstoer (2006) have demonstrated
that the consumption growth process postulated by Bansal and Yaron (2004) will
arise endogenously in a fairly standard production style real business cycle model,
purely as a result of the consumption smoothing efforts of the representative
agent armed with the same Epstein-Zin preference specification. While the
authors match a fairly limited set of business cycle facts, their study is important
not only for lending further credibility to the Bansal and Yaron (2004)
perspective but also for the critical issue of cross model verification.
Although standard Epstein and Zin preferences do not necessarily go very
far in resolving the equity premium puzzle, it is also informative to study the full
implication of these preferences for the properties of security returns beyond the
equity premium. Within the standard Mehra-Prescott (1985) context, Epstein
and Zin (1989, 1991) develop an elaborate dynamic programming argument to
derive the following asset pricing equation.

25

We include in the list of predecessors Backus and Zin (1994) and Cochrane and Hansen
(1992). Other implementations of the Epstein-Zin preference construct are Epstein and Zin
(1989), Yogo (2006) and Malloy et.al (2005).

27
The difficulty in having a pricing kernel that is dependent on the return to the agent’s wealth
portfolio is the ambiguity that is introduced in the corresponding empirical tests of the model:
what is a reasonable proxy for the wealth portfolio? Epstein and Zin (1991) use the traditional
“market portfolio” as that proxy, but it can reasonably be argued that this overstates the
covariance of investor wealth and individual asset returns. In particular, there is no labor income
in their model and thus their abstraction implies that human capital wealth is a negligible
component of total wealth.

As is well known, the standard CAPM relates the undiversifiable risk of an
asset to the covariance of its returns with the returns on the market portfolio.
When time and risk preferences are distinct, equation (10) suggests that both
covariances matter: the covariance of an individual asset’s return with the market
portfolio captures its essential undiversifiable risk, while the covariance of its
returns with the consumption growth rate fundamentally captures its risk across
time periods. With separate time and risk preferences it is natural that both
should be separately and individually present. But, as we are aware, this alone
does not, in general, solve the puzzle.28

1.4 Variation in the CRRA and EIS

But what about the basic Epstein-Zin construct generalized to admit time
variation in the CRRA and EIS parameters? Several authors, in particular, have
suggested that countercyclical risk aversion may allow for resolving the puzzle
(cf. Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Gordon and St. Amour (2000, 2003) and
Azeredo (2007) confirms that mild positive autocorrelation in the growth rate of consumption
also leads to negative equity premia for reasonably parameterized Epstein-Zin utility (EIS near
zero) in a standard Mehra and Prescott (1985) setting. For mild positive serial correlation and
EIS near 1 the equity premium is positive but still very small. It is also the case that Epstein-Zin
preferences do not admit the existence of a representative agent, even in the complete markets
context, because they are not of the expected utility form.
28

23

Danthine et al. (1992)). Note, however, that such modifications should still
respect time consistent planning and aggregation while also generating stationary
equilibrium security returns.
Simple generalizations to admit countercyclical risk aversion are, first and
foremost, problematic along the return stationarity dimension. Consider a simple
expected utility, representative agent preference specification of the form
%#
(*
'
E ''$ !tu(Ct; " t )***
''&t=0
*)

where u(Ct; ! t ) =

1"! t

Ct

1 " !t

with the stochastic process on ! t , the period CRRA,

chosen so that corr(! t, g t ) < 0 (gt denoting the output growth
rate, g t =

Yt
Yt!1

!1 ). An exploration of this seemingly minor generalization of the

standard Mehra and Prescott (1985) paradigm is revealing (see Danthine et al.
(2004) for details). In particular, returns are non stationary. This latter assertion
can be seen from a straightforward calculation of the representative agent’s
equilibrium (Ct = Yt) intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS):
(11)

IMRSt, t+1 = !

u1(Yt+1, " t+1 )
u1(Yt, " t )

=!

(Yt )

" t # " t+1

(g t+1 )

" t+1

Clearly the IMRSt, t+1 depends not only on a transformation of the growth
rate of output alone, as in Mehra and Prescott (1985), but also directly on the
level of output Yt. The presence of Yt in expression (11) guarantees that risk free
asset prices and the equilibrium risk free return will not be a stationary series
(the same is true of the risky asset).
We notice also that the presence of ! tand ! t+1 introduces another source
of uncertainty into the agent’s economic environment albeit one that he correctly

24

anticipates (rational expectations) probabilistically. It turns out that this single
parameter curvature variation has big consequences for the equity premium and
risk free rate generated by the model. This is presented in Table (3) below,
where the output growth process is otherwise identical to that found in Mehra
and Prescott (1985).

The number N indicates the length of the time series of prices and dividends that was used to compute return statistics.
N=120 corresponds to 30 years of data. Reported mean returns and standard deviations represent averages of estimates
obtained from 1000 independently generated time series of this length.

25

Note that under these parameterizations, the problem is not that returns are
insufficiently volatile or that the premium is too small but that both these
quantities are too large! Returns on both securities, but especially the equity
security are also much too large relative to the data. The point is not that the
model fails, for the idea that one parameter – even if it now assumes two distinct
values should allow enough flexibility to explain a myriad of financial statistics
remains a bit preposterous. Rather, what is of interest is the qualitative fact that
parameter uncertainty appears to have an enormous influence on the
representative agent’s demand for securities. But can this effect play itself out
more constructively in an Epstein-Zin context?
Melino and Yang (2003) explore a generalized version of Epstein and Zin
(1989) which admits parameter uncertainty in the CRRA for “timeless gambles,”
the EIS, and the agent’s subjective discount factor: 29

They also allow ! t " {!H, !L }, #t " {#H, #L } and !t " {!H, !L } where all
parameters subscripted by H occur simultaneously, and so also for those
subscripted by L (there are two parameter sets); H, L are also coincident with
the high and low growth states, respectively. Roughly speaking, they derive
expressions for the equilibrium Ere, !r , Erf and !r in the context of a
e

f

consumption growth process identical to that of Mehra and Prescott (1985) and

29

More precisely, under this specification, 1 ! " t is the CRRAt, EISt is defined by 1 / (1 ! !t ) ,

and !t is the customary (though now stochastic) subjective discount factor. Formulation (19)
leads to an equilibrium IMRSt of the form: IMRS t +1 = !(s t )g t +1

g t is the period t growth rate, and

Q t = q t / c t , the “price earnings ratio.” From our discussion of Epstein and Zin (1989, 1991), we
e

would expect such a term to be present in the IMRSt .

26

then ask what sets of parameters allow the resolution of these equations to satisfy
the observed values of Ere, !r , etc.
e

Melino and Yang (2003) find that certain reasonable sets of parameters do
allow the exact replication of the four required historical moments. Generally
speaking this is accomplished with “modest procyclical variation in the EIS, but
strong countercyclical risk aversion on the part of the representative agent.”30
Variation in the subjective discount factor is found to have only negligible effects.
A sample of the relevant parameters is found in Table 4.

This is Table 4 of Melino and Yang (2003).

The reader may judge for herself whether any of the reported combinations
constitute a reasonable resolution of the equity premium and associated puzzles.
We venture only to comment that, for all cases, the degree of risk aversion
implied by the low growth state seems high, especially in a context where the
probability that the low growth state will continue for more than one period is
less than 50%. There is also the added complication that risk tolerance cannot

27

be uniquely identified with the ! parameter; rather, it appears that ! , ! , and !
all enter into the preference for random consumption sequences. Melino and Yang
(2003) is important, for it presents with clarity the importance of countercyclical
risk aversion at least as a (joint with procyclical EIS) sufficient quantity for
resolving the first and second moments of the equity and risk free securities.

1.5

Habit Formation
A second approach to modifying preferences, that of incorporating habit

formation, was initiated by Constantinides (1990) and Sundaresan (1989).

31

1.5.1 The Concept
Under this specification, the agent’s period-by-period utility is a function
not only of his current consumption but also of his past consumption history. In
its simplest form the representative agent is postulated as maximizing
(13)

$

E% !tu(Ct " # Ct"1 ) ,
t=0

where Ct!1 denotes the agent’s prior period consumption and ! measures the
intensity with which the prior period’s consumption experience influences utility
today. Note that preferences are no longer time separable under this
specification: by assumption, an increase in the agent’s current consumption,
while lowering the marginal utility of his consumption today, increases the
marginal utility of his consumption tomorrow. Informally, if the “agent eats
more today, he ends up being hungrier when he wakes up tomorrow.”
A number of variations on this basic model are considered in the
literature. Under the most obvious of these generalizations, the agent’s “stock”
of habit is represented as some known function of his entire consumption history:

Ravn et al. (2004) develop a notion of habits being formed at the level of individual goods. It is
a notion that has yet to be applied, to our knowledge, in the equity premium literature.
31

28

u( ) = u(Ct,St ) where St = S(Ct!1, Ct!2, . . .) denotes an aggregator function that
summarizes the agent’s past consumption experience. Alternatively, the effect of
the habit may be captured as the ratio of current consumption to its habit or
!
S $&
#
benchmark level as per u(Ct,St ) = u ##Ct, t &&&, u1 ( ) > 0, u 2( ) > 0 . Both of these
#"
Ct &%

representations are referred to as internal habit models as the magnitude of the
habit is determined by the actions of the individual agent alone. 32
Pollock (1970), and subsequently Abel (1990) postulate a habit that is
external to the agent. Since Abel (1990), this perspective has been referred to as
“keeping up with the Joneses33.” It suggests that the agent is primarily
concerned with his own consumption relative to the consumption of others in
society; for example, u( ) = u(Ct ! "Ct!1 ) , where Ct!1 denotes the societal
average consumption level in the previous period, and ! the measure of his
sensitivity to it. From the agent’s perspective Ct!1 is exogenous. Under this
interpretation the agent wakes up feeling hungrier if those around him had all
enjoyed a large meal. It is an indirect way of modelling an agent’s preference for
relative “status.” In a representative agent equilibrium context, Ct = Ct but this
does not imply that internal and external habit formations lead to equivalent
asset pricing relationships.34

Habits that enter as a ratio to current consumption are compatible with balanced growth (see
King and Rebelo (1988)) whereas difference representations such as (11) are not. In order to
restore balanced growth in the latter case, the difference must be normalized by some series that
grows on average at the same rate as consumption. Such a normalization will appear in most
preference specifications going forward.
33
See Andrew Abel’s chapter in this volume (Abel (2007)).
34
To demonstrate the difference we need only write out the equilibrium equations which the
32

equity price must satisfy: In the case of an internal habit, C t!1 = C t!1 , q et satisfies
a. u1 (C t ! " C t!1 )q et = #

$ {u1(Ct+1 ! " Ct )[q t+1 + d t+1] + u1(Ct+1 ! " Ct )" q t } d F (
e

e

)

where the final term reflects the fact that higher asset purchases in period t reduce the habit in
t+1. In the case of an otherwise identical external habit,

29

We summarize these various alternatives by the tree structure below:

habit
formation

external
measured
as a

difference

internal
measured
as a

ratio

difference

ratio

Strictly speaking, preferences structures of this form lie outside the family of
recursive preference structures that admit consistent planning for a subtle reason:
utility today depends on past consumption which may depend on consumption
plans that are no longer feasible. The way around this is to view past
consumption as a habit state variable, and view utility today as conditional upon
it. In this way, consistency of choice is preserved. Aggregation is also preserved
under this simple habit formation, providing u( ) is of the CRRA form.
1.5.2 Relationship to the Equity Premium
As noted elsewhere in this volume, one source of the equity premium
puzzle is the very low volatility in per capita consumption growth. If the risky

With a finite number of possible dividends (and thus a finite number of habit levels) in either
case the state contingent asset prices can be obtained as the solution to a system of linear
equations (leading to a level stationary equilibrium). This is directly analogous to the Mehra and
Prescott (1985) situation.

capita) consumption risk, agents must be extremely risk averse – much more so
than micro studies to date have been able to identify.
Incorporating a habit feature sidesteps this issue by postulating that
agents are averse to variations in habit adjusted levels of consumption rather
than to consumption variation itself. Especially in circumstances where the
current consumption level and the habit do not differ significantly, small changes
in consumption growth can generate very large variations in habit adjusted
consumption growth. Even in the presence of modest overall habit adjusted risk
aversion, such variation may contribute to a resolution of the puzzle.
Another way to present the mechanism underlying habit models is to
compute the agent’s effective (or local) CRRA in the special case where the habit
is well proxied by a fixed subsistence level of consumption35:
1!"

(14)

u( ) = u(Ct

(C ! C)
! C) = t
1! "

.

Under these circumstances,
(15)

!Ctu11(Ct )
u1(Ct )

=

"

(1 ! C Ct )

.

Note that if the subsistence level of consumption is high relative to actual
consumption (a high threshold for status) then the local CRRA can be very large.
For example, if ! = 3 and

C
! .9 then the effective CRRA ≈ 30. Under this
Ct

habit specification, effective risk aversion is time varying: higher consumption in
period t-1 provokes the agent to be more risk averse, ceteris paribus, in period t.
It is also counter cyclical: when Ct (and output) is low relative to C in a
recession, C / Ct will be high and thus the effective CRRA high. With effective
risk aversion not directly observable, these theories will be difficult to test
35

empirically. Nevertheless, these simple relationships give us some idea of what is
going on.
They also provide an early warning sign that naive habit formation may
not necessarily represent a ‘cure-all’ that allows otherwise standard stochastic
equilibrium paradigms to explain the full range of financial phenomena. The basic
ingredient of the model, per capita consumption, in particular, does not display
much variation in the data. This suggests that under a proper calibration Ct and
Ct-1 will typically be similar in value. With an α close to one and standard
CRRA utility, the argument Ct ! " Ct!1 will frequently be very small and be on
the most concave portion of the agent’s utility surface. Marginal utility will be
highly volatile and, as a consequence, the risk free rate is likely to be
counterfactually highly volatile as well.36 This is borne out in many studies for
a wide range of settings (see, e.g., Constantinides (1990), Jermann (1998), etc.).
Taming this excessive volatility is a particular focus of the habit specification
described in the next section.

1.5.3 The Campbell and Cochrane (1999) Mechanism
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) postulate a process on an external habit,
Xt, and a period utility function of the simple CRRA form:
(16)

u(Ct, X t ) =

(Ct ! X t )1!"
1! "

=

(Ct ! St )1!"
1! "

where Ct in this case denotes the individual agent’s consumption and
" C ! X %'
$
t'
St = $$ t
'' his surplus consumption habit. Note that from the agent’s
$# C
&'
t
perspective, St is exogenous although in equilibrium this will not be so. They
next postulate

(i) consumption growth follows an i.i.d. lognormal process,

$t where ! t ~i.i.d. N(0, !2" ) and

(ii) the log of the surplus consumption ratio log St = st also follows a lognormal
process to be consistent with (i)
(16) st+1 = (1 ! ")s + " st + #(st )($ c t+1 ! g),
where !, s and g are parameters, s = log S ( S denotes the steady state surplus
consumption ratio), and !(st ) is a pre-specified sensitivity function. As a result,
the period t, t+1 pricing kernel is of the form

by identification (i) above. Under this specification it is apparent that the
standard deviation of the MRS, as well as its correlation with consumption
growth (both important determinants of the premium) will be determined by the
form of the sensitivity function. Campbell and Cochrane (1999) go on to make
the following assumption on the form of !(st ) ,

These requirements allow the habit formulation not only to reflect certain key
features of the data but also to generate a plausible habit process.37 In doing so
the authors attempt to set an upper bound on what can be achieved with a habit
model in an exchange setting; that is, they seek to provide a sort of “performance
standard” that other competing habit formulations must exceed. No axiomatic
foundations for the postulated surplus consumption process are proposed,
however.
Lastly, an i.i.d. process on dividend growth is postulated, one that is
imperfectly correlated with growth in consumption:
(21)

! dt+1 = g + "
! t+1 , ! t+1 ~ i.i.d. N(0, !2" ) with corr(!
! t, !"t ) = # . As before,

dt denotes the log of the actual period t dividend, Dt. With an independently
specified dividend process, the Ct = Yt identity characteristic of Mehra and
Prescott (1985) is broken, allowing an implicit wage process, levered capital
structure, etc. The parameters ! and "# remain to be specified.
The model – and, in particular, the surplus consumption process – is
designed to replicate the observed low risk free rate volatility. Taking advantage
of the well-known properties of the lognormal return process in conjunction with
model specifications (16) – (19), it becomes a matter of straightforward
manipulation to derive the implied expression for log rtf :
(22)

!nrtf = !!n" + #g ! #(1 ! $)(st ! s) !

#2%2
(1 + &(st ))2 .
2

Under substitution (16) expression (20) becomes
(23)

37

#
!nrtf = !!n" + #g ! (1 ! $) ,
2

To a first order approximation, (14) and (15) imply X t+1 = !X t + (1 ! !)(1 ! S)C t , which appears

fairly conventional.

34

a constant. This clearly is an extreme case of low volatility, and Campbell and
Cochrane (1999) offer generalizations by which the precise real risk free rate
volatility can be matched as well.
Plausibility dictates that the habit should not be predetermined, except
possibly at the steady state, and formulation (18), (20) also satisfies this
requirement. Indeed the fact that ! c t+1 appears in the expression for the period
t+1 surplus consumption ratio st+1 dictates that current consumption growth has
some influence on the habit.38 Since the habit is external, it represents the
influence on an individual’s preference ordering of the average consumption plan
of others in the society. Even in an environment of instant communication, it is
perhaps unreasonable to presume an immediate and fully external habit
adjustment process.
The sensitivity parameter !(st ) is also increasing in st by construction.
This guarantees countercyclical risk aversion and, as the authors demonstrate, a
countercyclical market price of risk. By making the agent very risk averse when
consumption is already low, this feature accentuates the perceived riskiness of a
variable consumption stream. Table 5 presents some sample results of this
elaborate exercise.

Including current consumption as a part of the habit formation process may be used to ensure
that period t’s consumption never falls below period t’s habit. Otherwise period utility may not
be well defined.

Source, Campbell and Cochrane (1999), various tables.

From these results it is clear that habit formation as articulated by
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) is a powerful mechanism for influencing security
returns in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Its flexibility is even
greater than what Table 5 suggests since Campbell and Cochrane (1999) subject
the model to other tests (e.g., predictability) which it easily transcends. Yet we
remain uneasy, as there is no empirical evidence to support the assertion that
surplus consumption habits evolve in the way proposed. Furthermore, for the
reported simulation, the agent’s effective CRRA varies between one and one
hundred, which is arguably extreme.
The surplus consumption habit process in Campbell and Cochrane (1999)
is highly specialized in other ways. Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2007), in particular,
point out that under their specification, the representative agent would

36

experience substantial welfare gains if 10% of her endowment were periodically
destroyed. The basic intuition is straightforward: while utility is diminished in
the period in which consumption endowment is destroyed, future utility gains
result since the habit is correspondingly lower. If the former loss is more than
compensated by the latter gains, the overall result is welfare enhancing. While
this is never the case under standard linear habit evolution, it is possible under
the Campbell and Cochrane (1999) construct.39 These anomalies suggest the need
for an axiomatic treatment of habit formation.
1.6

Behavioral Models
Behavioral models are ones for which the postulated agents are not “fully

rational.” While this can mean that they do not have rational expectations40 or
that they do not update their beliefs using Bayes’ rule, in the context of this
essay it will be taken to mean that the agents make decisions in accordance with
preferences which are not expected utility defined over consumption or wealth
(indirect utility). In this sense “habit formation” preferences are behavioral,
although their successful use in explaining a wide class of phenomena has given
them a degree of acceptance not typical of the broader behavioral finance
literature. While the proposed family of behavioral preference structures is
39

These observations are not as general as would initially appear. Consider the representative

agent utility function

! ! {g(x ) + v(c , x )}, where x
t

t

t

t

t

is the aggregate consumption history, c t is

the agent’s time-t consumption and v(c t , x t ) is increasing and concave in c t ; g(x t ) and v(c t , x t )
together constitute the agent’s period utility function. With an external habit, marginal utility is
given by !v(c t , x t ) / !c t , independent of g(x t ). The class of utility functions with common

v(c t , x t ) but different g(x t ) support the same equilibrium but may, in general, have different
welfare implications. Campbell and Cochrane indeed focus on equilibrium implications driven
exclusively by marginal utility !v(c t , x t ) / !c t . It is not the case that all utility functions in the
class will necessarily exhibit identical welfare implications and therefore the criticism leveled by
Ljungquist and Uhlig (2007) against Campbell-Cochrane cannot be viewed as a general statement.
We thank George Constantinides for pointing this out to us.
40
By this we mean, in the context of this essay, that agents know the exact probability
distribution governing all random outcomes – returns, consumption, etc. – driving the model.

otherwise quite large, most have not been applied to the study of the “equity
premium” and associated puzzles.41 For this reason we restrict our attention to
four: (1) Happiness Maintenance Preferences of Falato (2003), (2)
Disappointment Aversion and Generalized Disappointment Aversion of Gul
(1991) and Routledge and Zin (2004), (3) the Prospect Theory of Kahneman and
Tversky (1979) as applied, most especially, by Barberis et al. (2001) and (4) rank
dependent expected utility preference structures of Quiggin (1993).
1.6.1 Happiness Maintenance
Consistent with a large body of experimental evidence (see Isen (1989) for
a review) Falato (2003) builds on the assumption that risk aversion may be
procyclical. The phenomenon he seeks to capture is the following: investors who
are experiencing high utility – due either to a favorable income or wealth shock –
become more risk averse as they do not wish these favorable circumstances to be
lost; that is, they seek “happiness maintenance.” Falato’s model postulates that
investors derive direct utility from both consumption and the
consumption/wealth ratio. (As with Melino and Yang (2003), the associated
MRS in his model also necessarily contains as an argument the
consumption/wealth ratio). In particular, Falato (2003) assumes that the agent’s

(g(Ct, Wt;
period utility is defined over a composite good u( ) = u(g ) =
t

1"! t

where g(Ct, Wt; ! t ) = Ct

1"#

! t ))

1" #

!

Wt t and Wt, wealth, satisfies

Wt = (q et + Yt )zet
(his setting is otherwise the pure Mehra and Prescott (1985) exchange economy).
The agent’s full preference ordering over random consumption sequences is thus
given by

It is this latter feature which captures the “happiness maintenance”
phenomenon underlying Falato’s (2003) work: high average dividend
(consumption) growth in the recent past, x t(n) , leads the agent to be more risk
averse over wealth in the current period via the exponent (1 ! ")# t of the
wealth/consumption ratio.
Falato (2003) proves that equilibrium prices exist for a Mehra and
Prescott (1985) economy when the representative agent has “happiness
maintenance” preferences.42 Furthermore, the postulated ordering generates
stationary return series. Consistent planning and the existence of a representative
agent seems likely but have not been fully verified. The issue of full aggregation
remains open, as well. The essential problem is that the necessary and sufficient
conditions for these properties have not been derived in a general behavioural
context.
As with Melino and Yang (2003), the methodology required to calculate
state contingent asset prices and returns involves the solution to a non-linear

Such an exercise is non trivial. The main challenge to establishing existence derives from the
endogenous nature of the pricing kernel, which is, in turn, the result of the utility function’s
dependence on wealth.

(ii)

The µ , ! parameters refer to the output growth process in Mehra and Prescott (1985).

We are drawn particularly to the ! = 3, ! = .24 case which matches nearly all
the moments exceptionally well, with the sole qualification that the SD of the
equity return is about 30% too large. This is furthermore accomplished in a
model with fewer degrees of freedom than, e.g., Melino and Yang (2003). The
presence of the consumption wealth ratio as an argument of the period utility
function is not entirely surprising given earlier work by Lettau and Ludvigson
(2001). What is perhaps more striking (but not reported in the table) is the

40

ability of Falato’s model also to explain the predictable feature of stock returns
(see e.g., Campbell and Shiller (1998a)) at least as well as the habit construct of
Campbell and Cochrane (1999).43 Countercyclical risk aversion is clearly not a
necessary condition for this class of models to replicate, acceptably, the equity
premium and allied statistics. Furthermore, the addition of the (Ct/Wt) ratio
does not require the presence of a scaling factor since the consumption/wealth
ratio series is endogenously stationary.
The remaining behavioral approaches rely directly on counter-cyclical risk
aversion. In both of them, the investing agents are concerned especially with bad
outcomes relative to some benchmark and it is how this latter quantity is defined
that sets them apart.

44

We emphasize the Routledge and Zin (2004)

generalization of Gul (1991) since the latter model does not satisfactorily explain
the premium in the context of a straightforward Lucas (1978)-Mehra and
Prescott (1985) tree economy while the former does.45

In Falato’s (2003) model the cost of the business cycle is also about ten times the original
estimate of Lucas (1985). See also Alvarez and Jermann (2004).
44
As such they are direct descendants of Reitz (1988). Reitz (1988) retains the expected utility
representation and postulates a low-probability-very-low-consumption state. In Routledge and Zin
(2004) and Barberis et al. (2001), the “disaster”’ is measured relative to a benchmark. This fact
facilitates a more reasonable model calibration.
45
Bonomo and Garcia (1993) however combine a joint Markov switching endowments model with
a disappointment version to match the first and second moments of the equity premium and the
risk free rate.
43

41

1.6.2 Generalized Disappointment Aversion
Disappointment averse preferences place a greater utility weight on
outcomes that disappoint. For Gul (1991), this threshold is to be identified with
consumption realizations that lie below the (conditional) certainty equivalent
consumption level while for Routledge and Zin (2004) outcomes more distant
from the certainty equivalent are given special weighting.46
As in the Epstein and Zin (1989) utility construct, time and risk
preferences are separated. Their recursive intertemporal utility function
U(Ct, CEt+1) has the form
(26)

*#
- 1/)
1 &( )
1
) /
%
,
(
U(Ct,CEt+1 ) = ,%%(1 !
CEt+1 /

(C +

,+%$
/.

where CEt+1 is the certainty equivalent pertaining to random consumption in the
following period. In functional form (26), ! is the marginal rate of time
preference and

1
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
1! "

Risk preferences and the certainty equivalent computation are specified as
follows. Let us presume a pure Mehra and Prescott (1985) setting with a finite
number of states and suppose in some period t, the output level is Yti = Y i .
Temporal risk preferences are represented as a period utility function of the form
C!
u(C) =
(! " 0) or u(C) = log C ( ! = 0). The period t+1 certainty equivalent
!

Gul (1991) Disappointment Aversion (DA) preferences in a standard Mehra-Prescott (1985)
economy do not per se resolve the premium. Bonomo and Garcia (1993) enhance the construct
by incorporating a joint process on consumption and dividends that follow a Markov switching
model – in addition to (DA) preferences. They are able to match the risk free rate and the first
two moments of the premium.
46

42

! i ) is then endogenously determined as the
consumption level CEt+1 = CEt+1(Y
solution to the following definitional equation:

#
)
"
Y j *&CEt+1 (Y i )
)(

(Y j)" +$
" ,

If ! = 0 , structure (27) reduces to the definition of a certainty equivalent
in a pure expected utility context.47 Otherwise, there is a penalty, proportional to
! , for consumption realizations that lie sufficiently below the endogenously

determined certainty equivalent. If ! = 1, the certainty equivalent computation
follows according to Gul (1991); if ! < 1 the context is that of Routledge and
Zin (2004). Note that there is no mention of any external reference point as in
the (external) habit formation literature.
Nevertheless, the model generates counter-cyclical risk aversion, a feature
which bodes well for its asset pricing characteristics. Furthermore, GDA
preferences are homothetic, linear in probabilities, and have the same aggregation
properties as CRRA expected utility structures. They admit consistent planning
and Routledge and Zin (2004) provide the axiomatic underpinnings.
Table 7 below gives a quantitative idea of how well GDA preferences
perform in the standard Mehra and Prescott (1985) environment.

When ! " 0 , the Gul-Routledge-Zin structures relax the independence assumption that
underlies the expected utility representation. Independence fails because mixing in some arbitrary
payoff lottery with two lotteries under comparison may fundamentally change the tail properties
of each.

Table 7 is an amalgamation of selected results reported in Tables 1 and 2 in Routledge and Zin (2004).
The return statistics for the risk free rate are identical for the SD(Yt) = .05 and .10 cases because risk free securities do
not result in disappointments.

A number of these results are worthy of explicit mention. When dividend
volatility is low, GDA preferences give only modest premia; they become quite
44

large only when SD (Yt) = .10. For the data period underlying the empirical
background to the article, de-trended dividend volatility is on the order of 12%
which advocates for the model with SD(Yt) = .10; Campbell (1999) argues that
the SD of dividend should be a high as 28%. Qualitative results generally match
intuition; comparing columns (A) and (B), the result of a greater penalty is to
raise risk free asset prices and lower equity ones: risky securities are less desirable
and the premium rises. Comparing columns (B) and (D) the representative
agent becomes atemporally more risk averse and the premium naturally increases.
In general, equity volatilities (SD(Yt) = .10 case) match the data quite well; risk
free rate volatilities are generally too small. Although not part of Table 7, it can
also be shown that the risk free rate is procyclical. Overall, the results are very
good, and the model is advantaged by retaining a utility specification defined
only over the agent’s consumption. Note also that countercyclical risk aversion is
generated endogenously within the (GDA) construct. To see this, consider the
cases of columns A and B: disappointment aversion is the only source of risk
aversion ( ! = 1). As a result, the pricing kernel is risk neutral in the high growth
states (no disappointing outcomes) but substantially risk averse in the low
growth states (see Routledge and Zin (2004) for a more detailed analysis).
There is one other major structure that provides countercyclical risk
aversion: prospect theory as applied to asset pricing.

1.6.3 Prospect Theories
The major reference is Barberis et al. (2001). See also the essay by
Barberis and Huang, in this volume. The idea is to postulate investors who derive
utility not only from their period-by-period real consumption, but also over
equity portfolio gains and losses relative to a plausible benchmark.48 Roughly
See also Benartzi and Thaler (1995). These authors postulated investors with loss averse
preferences over variations in their financial wealth only. Without any direct connection to
48

45

speaking, these investors max U(c) + V(G/L) where G/L denotes gains or losses.
That utility is defined over only equity gains/losses rather than over aggregate
gains and losses to total wealth is an illustration of the notion of ‘narrow
framing’.
Furthermore, investors are more sensitive to losses than to gains (this is
the essence of the notion of ‘loss aversion’), with the extent of the loss sensitivity
depending on the agent’s prior portfolio experience. Equity gains and losses are
measured with respect to a benchmark, and if the investor’s past experience has
been to sustain losses relative to his benchmark, then he is modelled as being
more acutely sensitive to further ones. If his recent experience has been one of
equity portfolio gains, then the agent is modelled as being less sensitive to losses
(provided they are not so severe as to negate past gains). These requirements
lead to a kink in the agent’s utility curve at gain = loss = 0. Roughly speaking,
loss aversion as captured in Barberis et al. (2001) implies linear utility over gains
and losses to the equity portion of an investor’s portfolio of the form
#

V(X t+1, St, zt ) = $ t+1

"(z )X

%
& t t+1

X t+1 ! 0

where
X t+1 = StR et+1 ! R ft St .

Following our customary notation, R et+1 and R ft , designate, respectively, the gross
rates of return on stock and risk free bonds from period t to t+1 and St the
value of the stock portion of the investor’s portfolio. The latter is subscripted by
t alone as the risk free rate from period t to t+1 is solely determined by the risk
free bond’s price in period t. Gains or losses are thus measured relative to what
would have been earned had the stock portion St of his portfolio been invested in
consumption it is impossible to ascertain how their model might describe the joint processes on
equilibrium returns and consumption growth, for example.

risk free assets. The slope parameter ! (zt) measures the degree of loss sensitivity
as dependent on a variable, zt, that recalls past portfolio experience, where zt = 1
captures a case of no prior gains or losses, zt < 1 prior gains and zt > 1 prior
losses. A representative graphical portrayal is found in Figure 1.49

An amplified version of this same representation may be found in the companion chapter by
Barberis and Huang (2007).

or losses (zt >1).
Some careful interpretation is in order. Equation (31) describes the
evolution of the historical experience variable, zt, where R e amounts to the
average stock return and ! is a parameter which captures the memory in the
adjustment process.50 If equity returns are much less than average

R e is actually determined within the model in order that, at equilibrium, the median value of
Zt ! 1 . This turns out, not surprisingly, to be approximately the average equity return.

50

49

( R e / R et+1 > 1 ), this experience tends to increase zt +1 > zt since

! ≥ 0. If

! = 0, equation (31) suggests that zt ! 1 or that prior gains and losses have an

immediate effect on the investor’s risk attitude. If ! = 1 then the benchmark
adjusts slowly. Note that ! (zt), the loss sensitivity, is increasing in zt. Otherwise,

bt = b0C!" where C!" is purely a scaling factor which is included to maintain
stationarity in the equilibrium asset return distributions and b0 determines the
relative utility of gains and losses vs. the utility of consumption. There is,
however, no formal proof that investor preferences of this type survive
aggregation and no axiomatic foundation for their existence.
It remains to close the economy by specifying the exogenous dividend and
consumption processes (as in any exchange model there is one equity security
outstanding, and risk free bonds are priced in zero net supply). Barberis et al.
(2001) consider a number of scenarios. We first report the one which is in the
spirit of a pure Mehra and Prescott (1985) setting.

Note that for very large k – which leads via equation (30) to very high loss
aversion in some states of the world, the premium can rise to a level of 3.50% in
conjunction with about half (10.4%) the observed historical equity return
volatility. Increases in the value of the parameter b0, which place greater overall
relative weight on the utility of gains and losses also lend to increase the
premium but only to 1.26% when b0 = 100. Clearly, it is the loss aversion
parameter that has the power.

This table is drawn from Table III in Barberis et al. (2001).

Comparing Tables 8 and 9, it is apparent that separating consumption
from dividends has a substantial effect on raising the premium, and on increasing
return volatilities. This is not qualitatively entirely surprising, since there is now
much greater dividend volatility – which makes equities more volatile – and this
in turn affects an agent’s V( ) utility much more significantly. Although stock
returns are now less highly correlated with consumption (Table 9), this does not
matter since the investor is concerned about stock market volatility per se. This
latter fact more than compensates for the correlation diminution. By way of
contrast, this feature is relatively unproductive in habit style models as the
increased volatility of returns is offset by its reduced correlation with
consumption; the net consequence is very little change in the premium. An

52

increase in the parameter k, by increasing loss aversion, has a similarly salutary
effect on the premium as in Table 8.
Loss aversion/narrow framing is an appealing idea, and Barberis et al.
(2001) analyze its equilibrium asset pricing implications in a careful and thorough
way. There is, however, a sense in which their study is premature. In particular,
we as yet lack choice theoretic underpinnings and the aggregation properties are
as yet unconfirmed (strict aggregation will not hold).

1.7

Beyond One Good and a Representative Agent

All of the models considered in the prior sections of the review have been
essentially one good, representative agent models. In this section we first
highlight elements of the multi-goods literature which otherwise retains the
representative agent construct. Subsequently, we explore a one good
heterogeneous agent model where preferences are postulated to have a nonstandard expected utility form (rank dependent expected utility).
1.7.1

Multiple Goods
A basic reference here is Piazzesi et al. (2007) which considers

preferences defined over two goods, all non-housing consumption (this category
comprises non-durable goods consumption and the flow of services from nonhousing durables) and housing services. Retaining an otherwise standard Lucas
(1978) style exchange setting, the authors postulate the representative agent’s
preferences to be of the form

(34)

!

max E(" ! t u(Ct )), where
t =0

1#

(35)
(36)

Ct

u(Ct )=

1
"

1# 1
(##1)/#
t

Ct = (c

, and

"
+ $s(##1)/#
)#/(##1)
t

53

In (34) –(36), c t denotes non-housing consumption and st the flow of
housing services; accordingly, ! is the inter temporal elasticity of substitution
and ! is the corresponding intra temporal elasticity. For high ! values, the agent is
very willing to substitute goods within a period; as ! ! " they become perfect
substitutes. In this way, the level of housing services directly affects the marginal
utility of non-housing consumption, (the numeraire), and therein lies an
additional source of consumption risk. In severe recessions where both housing
services and non-housing consumption are simultaneously low, for example, the
marginal utility of non-housing consumption is especially high as the agent tries
to substitute future non-housing consumption for the anticipated shortfall in
future housing services. This increases MRS volatility.
An important methodological insight allows the equilibrium pricing kernel
to be expressed in terms of non-housing consumption, and the share of income
going to housing services, an insight that avoids the challenge of constructing a
time series for the somewhat imprecise notion of ‘housing services’. For the
parameterization 1

!

= 5, " = .99, and # = 1.05 they obtain a premium of 3.5%

in conjunction with a risk free return of 1.8% and a premium standard deviation
of 11%. None of these parameter values is a priori objectionable.51
Another study in the multi good tradition is Ait-Sahalia et al. (2004),
which characterizes investor consumption behaviour using time series of luxury
goods purchases. Roughly speaking, the idea is that since the ‘rich’ own a vastly
disproportionate share of non-pension equity and debt, it is their consumption
behaviour that should matter for equity pricing. For this group, furthermore, the
marginal consumption items are likely to be luxury goods (proxied by sales of

51

Piazzesi et. al (2007) rely on two sources of uncertainty: consumption growth and the log
expenditure ratio for housing. For that study it is important that they be statistically
independent, a property that is assumed. Others have questioned its validity.

54

expensive automobiles, the sales of high-end Manhattan co-operative apartments
etc.)
The distinction between luxury and basic consumption goods is captured in their
utility specification:
(37)

u(c t,Lt )=

(c t - a)1!!
1!!

+

(Lt +b)1!"
1!"

with constants a, b > 0 and ! > ! .

The former assignment implies that subsistence consumption is positive for basic
goods and negative (-b) for luxury goods. In equilibrium, luxury goods are not
consumed by those with low consumption levels (the poor). In fact, there exists a

c=a+b!/" Pt1/" > a such that Lt = 0 for c t ! c (Pt is the relative price for luxury
goods vis-à-vis basic ones). Finally, the rich consume an increasing fraction of
luxury goods as their incomes rise:

(38)

c
lim ( t ) = 0 ,
xt !" x
t

where x t = ct + Pt Lt denotes total consumption expenditure. Of relevance to this
essay is the fact that this specification leads to two unconditional asset pricing
equations of the form:
'"

(39)

! c -a $&
#
E(! ## t+1 &&&

#" Lt +b &% Pt+1

(r

)

f
' rt+1
) = 0 and

'#

(

)

Ait-Sahalia et al.(2004) then focus their model on a number of issues
related to and inclusive of the equity premium puzzle. Using various self
constructed time series, each corresponding to the aggregate purchase of some
type of luxury goods (e.g., luxury cars, wine, apartments etc), as proxy

55

consumption sequences, the authors estimate, respectively, the implied CRRAs
and equity premia, and explore the ability of the model to replicate the cross
sectional returns of the twenty five Fama and French (1993) portfolios. Broadly
speaking, they find that certain of these series co-vary strongly with the observed
return on equity and lead to high premia ( 7.8%, using an index of Manhattan
co-op apartment prices). In most cases, the CRRA estimates are on the order of
1/10 of that obtained using standard NIPA aggregate consumption measures: this
latter series varies hardly at all and is little correlated with equity returns. The
idea is certainly an appealing one, and the results are impressive. Yet the bynow-familiar questions remain: what are the axiomatic foundations, in what sense
is aggregation allowed, etc?
A less radical foray into multiple goods territory is found in Yogo (2006).
As such, Yogo (2006) provides another illustration of both the potential and the
limitations of the Epstein-Zin utility specification. He considers a model in
which the representative agent’s intra temporal utility level is a CES function of
nondurable goods consumption, Ct , and the stock of durable goods, Dt :52

52

In models of this type, the non-durable good is always the numeraire. Technically, period
utility is a function of non-durable consumption and the service flow from the stock of durable
goods. Yogo (2006) assumes the service flow is directly proportional to the stock.

from the optimal portfolio.
Following Hansen and Singleton (1982), Yogo (2006) then estimates the
parameter values (!, ", #, $, %) that are consistent with (1) the above model and
(2) the historical returns on the 24 Fama-French portfolios.53 He obtains the
estimates ! = .024, " = .827, # = .52, $ = .9 and % = 191 , all of which seem
plausible except for the risk aversion estimate, and, possibly, the relative intra
temporal emphasis on durable goods ( ! = .827 ).
That these values can, via (41), (42) and (43) match the data quite well is
attributable to the additional terms in the IMRSt,t+1 expression which are
dependent on the ( Dt /Ct ) ratio. In the data, this ratio is highly pro-cyclical and
thus magnifies the counter cyclicality of the marginal utility of consumption.
Marginal utility becomes very high at business cycle troughs where both
consumption itself and the ( Dt /Ct ) ratio are low. Nevertheless, because durable
consumption is so smooth, the required CRRA estimate is still excessive relative
to that obtained in standard microeconomic applications. While the Epstein and
Zin construct is flexible in accommodating many phenomena, it does not
necessarily do so for reasonable parameter choices. Note that for this story to

As such, Yogo’s (2006) model also displays a form of composition risk (via the

Dt /Ct ratio).
57

work, ! < ". In comparing financial statistics, it is the low value of the EIS that
allows the model to replicate the historically observed risk free rate.
Multiple goods per se are not a guarantee of puzzle resolution,
however. Although Yogo (2006) obtains generally attractive results in a model
with durable and non-durable gods within the Epstein-Zin preference
specification, Giannikos (2007) derives equilibrium premia similar to that
obtained in Mehra and Prescott (1985) using standard CES preferences defined
over non-durable goods consumption and various representations of the durable
goods service flow. His results are driven by positive autocorrelation in the
estimated non-durable consumption dividend, a fact that leads to a negative
premium on the non-durable goods firm (recall Azeredo (2007)). This negative
premium overwhelms the positive premium to the durable goods producing firm,
giving an overall market premium that is unfortunately small, and negative for
many parameterizations.

1.7.2

Agent Heterogeneity

There already exists a substantial literature that explores the magnitude of the
premium in incomplete market settings where heterogeneity is captured via the
experience of idiosyncratic income shocks. In this section, we focus alternatively
on preference heterogeneity, its implications for the equity premium in a trading
environment, and, ultimately, the usefulness of the representative agent
construct. The literature is extremely small: we found only two directly relevant
papers, Chan and Kogan (2002) and Chapman and Polkovnichenko (2006).54

54

We thank Nick Barberis for bringing these papers to our attention.

58

Each studies an exchange equilibrium where financial markets are
complete. Chan and Kogan (2002) postulate agents with ratio habit
preferences of the form
u(c t, X t; !) =

1
(c t / X t )1!!
1! !

where c t is the consumption of an individual agent withCRRA parameter
value ! . The X t term, which is their measure of the economy wide living
standard, is defined as a weighted average of past aggregate endowment
realizations:

x t =ln(X t ) satisfies
t

x t =x 0 e -!t + !t ! c -!(t-s)ysds
0

where y t =ln(Yt ), and Yt is the period t economy wide endowment.
The latter follows a standard Brownian motion process. Note that the choice
of the parameter ! determines how strongly past endowment experience
influences the living standard measure.
Chan and Kogan (2002) construct a representative agent and solve for
equilibrium by solving the associated planning problem. Changes in the cross
sectional distribution of wealth lead to changes in the economy wide level of
risk aversion in the following way. Since the risk averse agents hold most of
their wealth in stocks, when endowment is low and the stock price low, the
fraction of the economy’s wealth controlled by these agents diminishes,
leading to increased economy wide risk aversion. The resultant countercyclical
risk aversion allows their model to match nearly all of the Campbell and
Cochrane (1999) results except for the volatility of the risk free rate. In Chan
and Kogan (2002) it is too high relative to what is observed in the data; in
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) it matches the data by construction. Chan

59

and Kogan (2002) is important particularly for generating countercyclical risk
aversion endogenously in a way that works to resolve the puzzle.
In Chapman and Polkovnichenko (2006), preference heterogeneity works
against these same stated goals. They postulate a setting where investors have
different rank dependent expected utility preferences (RDEU). With its
surprising implications, the paper demands a somewhat detailed review.
Rather than weighing various utility outcomes by their objective probabilities,
RDEU preferences weight outcomes by some non-linear weighting function
defined over the cumulative probabilities of outcomes that have been utility
ranked from worst to best. Typical parameterizations end up over weighting
bad outcomes. In general, a RDEU welfare functional will have kinks at
allocations where consumption outcomes are equal across any two states.
Consider an environment of i=1,…n states of nature and K agents where
all agents have the same CRRA utility function over consumption outcomes
in particular states, Uk (c ki )=

(c ki )1!!
1! !

, where c ki represents agent k’s

consumption in state i. Let (Ck , Pk ) denote a consumption lottery where,
respectively, consumption across states is ranked from worst to best, and P
denotes the vector of cumulative probabilities. More specifically,
(Ck , Pk ) = (c1k ..,cNk ,P1k ,..,PNk ) where c ki <c ki+1 and Pik = ! ! j where ! j is the
j!i

objective probability of the state corresponding to the consumption allocation

c ki . Note that different outcomes will have different associated vectors of
cumulative probabilities. In the Chapman and Polkovnichenko (2006)
formulation, the RDEU value function of agent k is given by
(44)

N

Uk ( {C,P} )=! q k (P)u k (c ki )
i=1

60

where

!

!

q k (P) = (Pik ) k !(Pi-1k ) k is the weighting function. Note that if !k ! 1,

the expression collapses to one of expected utility and if !k <1, the agent is
pessimistic. In general equilibrium, the q k (P) weights will be endogenously
determined, just as the consumption outcomes across states are themselves
determined endogenously in equilibrium. The authors then go on to consider a
two agent, two date equilibrium where the agents differ in their pessimism
parameters, !k . With !1 = 1 (expected utility) and !2 = .4 (substantial
pessimism) they find that the equity risk premium is only 17% of the risk
premium in an economy where the consumers are identical ( !1 = !2 = .4 ).
It is, however, twice the level obtained for the corresponding homogeneous
preference economy, where everyone has expected utility ( !1 = !2 = 1 ). In
solving for the equilibrium they construct a representative agent and solve
accordingly. In equilibrium, REDU economies display limited risk sharing
since the preference structure implies that for small risk premia, the more
pessimistic agent may not choose to invest in the risky asset at all. Aggregate
risk is then priced only by the less pessimistic agent. What is present is
endogenous participation in the equity markets. In a dynamic equilibrium
multi agent RDEU model we could imagine a situation of some agents
entering and exiting the equity markets voluntarily as the economy passes
from expansions to recessions. Would such an economy endogenously exhibit
countercyclical risk aversion? Would the attractive business cycle/equity
premium characteristics of, e.g., the Guvenen (2005) and Danthine and
Donaldson (2002) models be preserved, despite the fact that participation in
equity markets is not fixed a priori? These are reasonable issues to explore.
From the perspective of this paper the results are especially striking. In
particular, Chapman and Polkovnichenko (2006) reminds us that using the

61

representative agent construct in a non standard heterogeneous preference
setting may be uninformative as it ignores important endogenous risk sharing
effects.
Before leaving this body of material, some comparative remarks might be
useful. Table (10) below summarizes the properties of the various preference
specifications considered thus far.

(i)

The question mark indicates that the answer to the question is unknown or not fully understood.

We first note that a number of open questions remain. Many involve aggregation.
Without this property, the results of Chapman and Polkovnichenko (2006) may

62

be duplicated in other contexts. Habit formation of Campbell and Cochrane
(1999), Prospect Theory of Barberis et al. (2001) and GDA preferences of
Routledge and Zin (2004) all yield effective counter-cyclical risk aversion, and in
many respects, their results with regard to the equity premium are similar. A
number of features of the GDA construct would seem to give it an edge, however.
Relative to simple expected utility, it generates the fewest additional parameters
and it is the only structure of the three (to date) with axiomatic foundations.
Relative to the two alternatives cited above they are the only structure that
allows the separation of risk and time preferences. (More recent work of Barberis
and Huang (2001) allows this as well.) Furthermore, there is no need for external
scaling or an external reference point to maintain return stationarity. In short,
GDA preferences have the advantage of economy and simplicity. It is unclear,
however, if any of these constructs will be compatible with the stylized financial
and business cycle facts – or, indeed, with generally accepted consumption
processes – when placed in a production setting.
Numerous other behavioral representations are modelled in the literature.
Constantinides et.al. (2007) for example, argue for a period utility representation
of the form

U(c t ) + LV(Bt )
where c t denotes the period consumption and V(Bt ) =

1-!B

Bt

1 ! !B

the utility of

bequests, Bt . The L parameter assumes a value of 0 except in the final period of
the agent’s life when L=1 (the context is obviously one of finitely-lived
overlapping generations). Since Bt measures the value of bequests, it is a
quantity that will be highly correlated with the return on the stock market. As a
result, agents who are substantially bequest risk averse will demand a high

63

premium to hold equity securities in their final period of life. While this
modelling device does lead to a high premium, other counterfactuals arise.

2.

Production Economies
The production based asset pricing literature is oriented to constructing

models that successfully replicate both the stylized facts of the business cycle and
the financial markets. To review how the business cycle is characterized in the
data and in dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium models, see the essay by
Jean-Pierre Danthine, John Donaldson and Paolo Siconolfi in this volume
(Danthine et al. (2007). Relevant papers with a primary focus on the equity
premium puzzle include Jermann (1998), Boldrin et al. (2001), Danthine et al.
(1992), Danthine and Donaldson (2002) and Guvenen (2005). Lettau and Uhlig
(2000) focus only on the relationship of habit formation to consumption
volatility, although the implications of their results for the premium are
straightforward.
Production models display the feature that the dividend series and the
asset pricing agent’s consumption series are endogenously determined within the
model.55 All the mechanisms reviewed in this essay will have consequences for the
statistical properties of these series. Habit formation in a production context
such as Hansen (1985), in particular, will induce the model’s representative agent
to tailor his investment and labor service decisions in such a way as to reduce,
dramatically, his endogenous consumption volatility vis-à-vis an otherwise
identically parameterized construct without the habit feature: consumption as a
pure macroeconomic quantity becomes counterfactually smooth, and the
associated premium falls essentially to zero. A successful model must thus
display not only a strong desire on the part of agents for consumption smoothing,

55

Accordingly, assets are then priced using the standard Lucas (1978) asset pricing perspective.

64

but also severe (but plausible) technological restrictions which inhibit their
ability to do so.
Within the production literature most models require some variation on
habit formation to generate a high and countercyclical level of effective risk
aversion. The complementary features which interfere with the consequent
consumption smoothing are myriad. We consider Jermann (1998) as an
important illustrative case.
Jermann’s equilibrium allocations of consumption, investment etc., solve:

productivity of .5% per quarter (the calibrated time period).56 Clearly it is the
habit formation feature most prominently that causes the agent to display a
strong desire for consumption smoothing.
But what features stand in his way from doing so? First and foremost is
the cost of capital adjustment function

Jermann’s (1998) exercise are presented in Table 11 below:

All the claims we have made in this section are manifest in Table 11.
Consider column A statistics. This corresponds to an unfettered production
model: no habit and no adjustment costs, so the agent is totally free to adjust his
investment to smooth out his consumption. As a result, the premium is a miserly
.02% which is even lower than its exchange economy counterpart. Column B
corresponds to an otherwise identical case but for ! = 10. The premium does

66

rise, but by an insignificant .24%, and return standard deviations remain much
too low (compare this result with those in Table 1). In column C, the agent
displays habit formation with a habit parameter ! = .82. This greatly amplified
effective risk aversion induces the agent to tailor his investment plan to elicit
greater consumption smoothing. As a result the SD of the growth rate of
consumption declines by more than one half. Despite the added local risk
aversion, the smoother consumption series draws the premium – and the return
volatilities - more or less back to their column A values.
Costs of adjustment (column D) make it substantially more expensive for
the agent to effect consumption smoothing via investment volatility. With this
obstruction, the premium rises but still falls short even of 1%. When habit
formation is incorporated in conjunction with COA (column E), the premium
matches its historical benchmark, confirming the earlier intuition; equity return
volatility is quite reasonable as well, as is the mean risk free rate. Only the risk
free rate volatility is mis-matched, with the model producing a SD more than
twice the historical level. This is not entirely surprising given the knife-edged
nature of the habit formation mechanism and the enormous swings in risk
aversion it tends to generate.
Column F, from an early version of Boldrin et al. (2001) contains the
results for a slightly modified Jermann (1998) model enriched by incorporating an
agent whose utility is linear in leisure (risk neutral), essentially as in Hansen
(1985). Such an agent is unconcerned with variations in his labor supply; under
this specification the agent’s period utility function is of the form

u(c t, c t!1,1 ! n t ) = log(c t ! "c t!1 ) + Bn t, for some constant B < 0 .
Unfortunately, this added flexibility causes the premium to collapse to a mere
.001%, with the equity and risk free standard deviations not far behind at,
respectively, .46% and .48%. This example fully illustrates the difficulty in
incorporating even standard preference mechanisms to production settings. As of
67

this writing, we are unaware of any attempts to incorporate “loss aversion” or
“happiness maintenance” into a production context but the consequences are
likely to be similar.
Note that nearly all recent production models rely in some way on habit
formation. Eschewing this feature, Campanale et al. (2007) explore the business
cycle and agent pricing properties of a production economy very similar to
Jermann (1998) (for instance there is a cost to adjusting capital) where the
representative agent possesses Epstein-Zin preferences and the certainty
equivalent is obtained using GDA risk preferences and special cases thereof
(expected utility and (DA) Disappointment aversion preferences). Solving the
model using traditional discrete state space methodologies, they are able to
replicate a very wide class of stylized financial and business cycle facts, thereby
effectively challenging the habit formation device. Perhaps most strikingly, they
do so for implied risk aversion that is similar to a logarithmic utility expected
utility agent. As with the earlier habit based literature, risk free rate volatility
remains excessive.57 It would also be of interest to know the consequences for
their results of admitting a variable labor supply. The paper is important not
only for introducing these richer preference structures into a production context
but also for more broadly re-energizing the asset pricing production research
program.
Production based asset pricing models are important because they afford
an opportunity for cross-model verification. Since it is the actions of the same
agents that give rise to both macroeconomic and financial phenomena, a
comprehensive, reliable model should be able to explain both sets of stylized facts
equally well. At the current level of understanding, this is clearly not yet the
case.
57

Kallenbruner and Lochstoer (2004) demonstrate that a reasonably calibrated production
model with Epstein-Zin preferences can jointly explain important macroeconomic and financial
stylized facts without the excessive risk free rate volatility characteristic of habit formulations.

68

3. Disaster Events and Survivorship Bias
Reitz (1988) has proposed a solution to the equity premium puzzle
that incorporates a very small probability of a very large drop in
consumption (a ‘disaster state’). Beyond the incorporation of this third
growth state, the structure of his model is identical to that of Mehra and
Prescott (1985). Since disaster states are ones of extremely high marginal
utility of consumption, we might expect their incorporation to push up risk
free asset prices and diminish risky ones. As a result, the premium should
rise. Table 12 presents a sample of scenarios drawn from Reitz (1988).

Taken from Table 3 of Reitz (1988)
Taken from Table 6 of Reitz (1988)

The incorporation of the disaster scenario, even with small conditional
or unconditional probability, does allow for a resolution of the premium. This
is not in dispute although the plausibility of such a huge drop in
consumption is open to question. This model requires a 1-in-100 chance of a
25 percent decline in consumption to reconcile the equity premium with a
risk aversion parameter of 10. Following on these results, Barro (2006)
details all major cross country consumption declines post 1913. While certain
70

European countries experienced consumption declines of as much as 64%
during World War II (e.g. Germany and Greece), even in the worst years of
the Great Depression US consumption only declined by about 30%. In light
of these figures, the percentage declines postulated by Reitz (1988) do not
seem so extreme. One must assess other potential implications of the model,
however. One is that the real interest rate and the probability of the
occurrence of the extreme event move inversely. For example, the perceived
probability of a recurrence of a depression was probably very high just after
World War II and subsequently declined over time. If real interest rates rose
significantly as the war years receded, that evidence would support the Rietz
hypothesis. Similarly, if the low probability event precipitating the large
decline in consumption were a nuclear war, the perceived probability of such
an event has surely varied over the last 100 years. It must have been low
before 1945, the first and only year the atom bomb was used. And it must
have been higher before the Cuban Missile Crisis than after it. If real interest
rates had moved as predicted, that would support Rietz’s disaster scenario.
But they did not. The reader is referred to Mehra and Prescott (1988) for a
detailed response to Reitz (1988) along these lines.
Barro (2006) presents a model in the same spirit as Reitz (1988) but in a
context where more attention may be given to calibration and the historical
record. The historical justification for his calibration is, in fact, fascinating to
read. The point of departure of the paper is the postulation of a stochastic
process for aggregate output growth which allows for rare events in a generalized
Rietz setting. Specifically, he models aggregate output growth as a random walk
with drift, whose innovations are of three possible types:
a) “diffusive” shocks (i.i.d. normal shocks),
b) jump shocks of “type v” -- shocks which represent situations where output
contracts sharply but there is no occurrence of a default on debt, and

71

c) jump shocks of “type w”-- shocks which represent situations where output
contracts sharply and a default on debt ensues58.
In particular, Barro assumes that the log of output Yt ! Ct grows
according to the random walk with drift process
(45)

! t+1 + v
! t+1
log Yt+1 = log Yt + g + u

! t+1 is an i.i.d random variable distributed N(0, !2u ) and v
! t+1 ( jump

shock “type v” ) captures low probability downward jumps in GDP. If a
disaster occurs, with probability p, output declines by the fraction b. Very
roughly speaking, a reasonable calibration requires b to be large and p small.

The results presented here are intriguing and lend support to a resurrection
of the disaster scenario as a viable justification for the premium.
Barro (2006) does not explicitly define a type w shock. We introduce it here as an aid to
exposition.

The distinction between “type v” events and “type w” events is
theoretically appealing in terms of their different implications for quantities and
prices. However, we feel this distinction is largely a consequence of the specific
functional forms used to model the two types of rare events and the assumption
that they are independent-- something we intuitively think is not very plausible.
To support the observed equity premium (in the baseline model) a decline
in GDP growth of 50% is needed. The plausibility of such a substantial decline in
per capita GDP growth is justified by the figures in Barro (2006), Table 1 where
this decline is shown to be 64% in Germany and Greece (during World War II)
or 31% in the US (during the Great Depression). These observations however, are
not at an annual frequency59. Looking at data at an annual frequency, we see
little evidence of such a substantial decline either in GDP growth or in the
59

In a sense the results are obtained using the 4-year drop in consumption as if it is a 1-

year effect. The claimed equity premium should be compared to the observed 4-year effect
4x6=24% and not the 1-year 6%.

73

growth rate of consumption. If the equity premium is estimated at an annual
frequency, then the relevant growth rates should also be at annual frequencies.
We argue that calibrations should be done at the same frequency as observations.
As is standard in the equity premium literature, Barro calibrates his
model using output growth rates rather than consumption growth rates since
in a pure exchange setting they are identical. While this distinction may not
matter in a stylized economy without disaster states, the two quantities
might empirically be quite different in the event of an extreme disaster.
Consumption per capita will probably be a much smoother series than GDP
per capita. In the event that such states occur, consumption is unlikely to
remain a constant proportion of the output. Capital investment and capital
utilization rates will change and act as channels to absorb the negative
productivity shocks (see also section 2) enabling consumption smoothing over
time and across states. For this reason, since we do live in a production
economy, it would be interesting to explore the robustness of Barro’s (2006)
results using cross-country data on the growth rates of per capita
consumption instead of output within that more general context.
A closely related literature concerns ‘peso problems’. This means that
returns are higher than justified by current experience because investors
assign a positive probability to some as - yet - unrealized - disaster state. In
the context of this essay, it suggests the possibility that the observed equity
premium in the U.S. may result from expectations of disaster events which
happen not to have materialized in the sample period of observations. Recent
work by Goetzmann and Jorion (1999) supports this perspective: after
concluding that the high U.S. historical premium is in some sense unique,
they suggest that it may be attributable to the fact that disastrous events
(most especially WW II) affecting many financial markets have largely
spared the U.S. economy.

74

In a production setting similar to Jermann’s (1988) but with a
variable labor supply, no costs of adjustment and no habit (a model which is
in some sense set up with a bias against resolving the puzzle), Danthine and
Donaldson (2002) replicate all first moments of returns, nearly exactly, in a
peso style model where the disaster is anticipated but never realized. The
required ingredients mandate a debt/equity ratio of .3, an anticipated
disaster state where output falls by 50%, a CRRA of 3 and a (conditional)
probability of entering the disaster state of .008. Return volatilities are much
too low, however (this is to a lesser extent true for Barro (2006) as well). A
similar but more detailed exercise is undertaken by Cecchetti et.al. (1993,
2000) in an exchange setting. All this is to suggest that unrealized beliefs
may be critical to the puzzle’s resolution and that the results in Reitz (1988)
and others can be strengthened if reported returns are generated from time
series in which the actual disaster state does not appear. Veronesi (2004)
goes one step further by postulating a peso-style model with representative
agent learning. Dividends follow a simple linear stochastic process where the
drift coefficient assumes one of two values, a normal level of ! and a low,
recession level of ! ; there is a small probability of shifting from ! to ! and
a high probability of returning. The drift coefficient is not observed directly,
however, and Veronesi (2004) derives the period-by-period posterior
probability of being in the normal growth state. This estimate itself evolves
stochastically. Veronesi (2004) then explores the asset pricing characteristics
of this economy for time paths where the low growth state is never actually
realized. He derives high price sensitivity to dividend changes, increased
return volatility in perceived recessions etc., as well as significant equity
premia. Unfortunately, theories built on beliefs other than pure rational
expectations are difficult to test empirically.
Another attempt at resolving the puzzle proposed by Brown et al.
75

(1995) focuses on the related notion of survival bias. The central thesis here
is that the ex-post measured returns reflect the premium, in the United
States, on a stock market that has successfully weathered the vicissitudes of
fluctuating financial fortunes. Many other exchanges were unsuccessful and
hence the ex-ante equity premium was low. Since it was not known a priori
which exchanges would survive, for this explanation to work, stock and bond
markets must be differentially influenced by a financial crisis. Governments
have expropriated much of the real value of nominal debt by the mechanism
of unanticipated inflation. Five historical instances come readily to mind:
During the German hyperinflation, holders of bonds denominated in Reich
marks lost virtually all value invested in those assets. During the Poincare′
administration in France during the 1920s, bond holders lost nearly 90% of
the value invested in nominal debt. And in the 1980s, Mexican holders of
dollar-denominated debt lost a sizable fraction of its value when the Mexican
government, in a period of rapid inflation, converted the debt to pesos and
limited the rate at which these funds could be withdrawn. Czarist bonds in
Russia and Chinese debt holdings (subsequent to the fall of the Nationalists)
suffered a similar fate under communist regimes.
The above examples demonstrate that in times of financial crisis,
bonds are as likely to lose value as stocks. Although a survival bias may
impact on the levels of both the return on equity and debt, there is no
evidence to support the assertion that these crises impact differentially on
the returns to stocks and bonds; hence the equity premium should not
necessarily be materially affected. In every instance where trading equity has
been suspended, due to political upheavals, etc., governments have either
reneged on their debt obligations or expropriated much of the real value of
nominal debt through the mechanism of unanticipated inflation.

76

The difficulty that several model classes have collectively had in
explaining the equity premium as a compensation for bearing risk leads us to
conclude that perhaps it is not a “risk premium” but rather due to other
factors. We consider these in the next section.

4 Market Incompleteness and Trading Frictions
Market incompleteness assumes one of two different forms: (1) certain
securities are not traded, and/or (2) certain individuals are for some reason
excluded from financial market participation. A complete market structure
where all investors can trade any security is necessary for the construction of
the representative agent. In this case, the equilibrium in a heterogeneous full
information economy is isomorphic in its asset pricing implications to the
equilibrium of a representative agent, full information economy, if households
have von-Neumann-Morgenstern preferences. It is this paradigm that has
provided the foundation to the essay so far. In this section we briefly review
context (2), above, since the first is more than adequately considered in the
essays by Constantinides and Heaton and Lucas. In our discussion of (2) we
focus on restricted participation resulting from borrowing constraints
imposed on certain agents.

4.1 Restricted Participation
In infinite horizon models, the effect of borrowing constraints and
transaction costs is to force investors to hold an inventory of bonds
(precautionary demand) to smooth their consumption. As a result, agents
come close to equalizing their marginal rates of substitution with little effect

77

on the equity premium: the economy is essentially one of complete markets.60
Recent attempts to resolve the puzzle by incorporating both borrowing
constraints and consumer heterogeneity have thus focused on finite horizon
OLG economies. One such example is proposed in Constantinides, Donaldson
and Mehra (2002).61
The authors construct an overlapping-generations (OLG) exchange
economy in which consumers live for three periods.

In the first period, a

period of human capital acquisition, the consumer receives a relatively low
endowment income.

In the second period, the consumer is employed and

receives wage income subject to large uncertainty. In the third period, the
consumer retires and consumes the assets accumulated in the second period.
The implications of a borrowing constraint are explored by deriving
and contrasting the stationary equilibria in two versions of the economy. In
the borrowing-constrained version, the young are prohibited from borrowing
or from selling equity short. This is not an artificial constraint since loans
and short sales require collateral (accumulated wealth), which the young
typically lack.62 The borrowing-unconstrained economy differs from the
borrowing-constrained one only in that the borrowing constraint and the
short-sale constraint for the young are absent.
There are two types of securities in the model, bonds, and equity with excoupon and ex-dividend prices qbt and qet respectively. Bonds are a claim to a
coupon payment b every period, while the equity is a claim to the dividend
stream {dt}. The consumer born in period t receives deterministic wage income
w0> 0 in period t, when young; stochastic wage income w1t+1 > 0 in period t+1,

60

This is true unless the supply of bonds is unrealistically low. See Aiyagari and Gertler (1991).
See also the companion papers by Constantinides et. al (2005,2007) and the paper by
Storesletten et. al (2007) in this volume.
62
Lustig and van Nienwerburgh (2005,2006) also explore the consequences of collateral
constraints but in a dynamic housing capital asset pricing model.

78

when middle-aged; and zero wage income in period t+2, when old. The consumer
purchases zet,0 shares of stock and zbt,0 bonds when young. The consumer adjusts
these holdings to zet,1 and zbt,1 , respectively, when middle-aged. The consumer
liquidates his/her entire portfolio when old. Thus zet,2 = 0 and zbt,2 = 0.
An unconstrained representative agent’s maximization problem is
formulated as follows. An agent born in period t solves:

where ct,j is the consumption in period t +j (j = 0, 1, 2) of a consumer born in
period t. When considering the borrowing constrained equilibrium the following
additional constraints are imposed zet,0 > 0 and zbt,0 > 0.
The model introduces two forms of restricted participation. First,
consumers of one generation are prohibited from trading claims against their
future wage income with consumers of another generation.63 Second, consumers
of one generation are prohibited from trading bonds and equity with consumers
of an unborn generation. As discussed earlier in Section 2.3, absent a complete
set of contingent claims, consumer heterogeneity in the form of uninsurable,
persistent and heteroscedastic idiosyncratic income shocks, with counter-cyclical
63

Being homogeneous within their generation, consumers have no incentive to trade claims with
consumers of their own generation.

conditional variance, can potentially contribute to the resolution of empirical
difficulties encountered by representative-consumer models.64
The novelty lies in incorporating a life-cycle feature to study asset
pricing. As discussed earlier, the attractiveness of equity as an asset depends
on the correlation between consumption and equity income. If equity pays
off in states of high marginal utility of consumption, it will command a
higher price, (and consequently a lower rate of return), than if its payoff is in
states where marginal utility is low.

Since the marginal utility of

consumption varies inversely with consumption itself, equity will command a
high rate of return if it pays off in states when consumption is high, and vice
versa.65 In and of itself, this is the standard intuition.
A key insight of the paper is the observation that as the correlation of
equity income with consumption changes over the life cycle of an individual,
so does the attractiveness of equity as an asset.

Consumption can be

decomposed into the sum of wages and equity income.

A young person

looking forward has uncertain future wage and equity income; furthermore,
the correlation of his equity income with his consumption will not be
particularly high, as long as stock and wage income are not highly correlated.
This is empirically the case, as documented by Davis and Willen (2000).
Equity will thus be a hedge against fluctuations in wages and a “desirable”
asset to hold as far as the young are concerned.
The same asset (equity) has a very different characteristic for the
middle-aged. Their wage uncertainty has been entirely resolved: their future
retirement wage income is either zero or deterministic and the innovations

64

See Mankiw (1986) and Constantinides and Duffie (1996).
This is precisely the reason, as explained earlier, why high-beta stocks in the simple CAPM
framework have a high rate of return. In that model, the return on the market is a proxy for
consumption. High-beta stocks pay off when the market return is high, i.e. when marginal utility
is low, hence their price is (relatively) low and their rate of return high.
65

80

(fluctuations) in their consumption occur from fluctuations in equity income.
At this stage of the life cycle, equity income is highly correlated with
consumption. Consumption is high when equity income is high, and equity is
no longer a hedge against fluctuations in consumption; hence, for this group,
it requires a higher rate of return.
The characteristics of equity as an asset therefore change, depending
on who the predominant holder of the equity happens to be.
considerations thus become crucial for asset pricing.

Life cycle

If equity is a

“desirable” asset for the marginal investor in the economy, then the observed
equity premium will be low, relative to an economy where the marginal
investor finds it unattractive to hold equity.

The deus ex machina is the

stage in the life cycle of the marginal investor.
The authors argue that the young, who should be holding equity in an
economy without frictions and with complete contraction, are effectively shut
out of this market because of borrowing constraints. The young are
characterized by low wages; ideally they would like to smooth lifetime
consumption by borrowing against future wage income (consuming a part of
the loan and investing the rest in higher return equity). However, they are
prevented from doing so because human capital alone does not collateralize
major loans in modern economies for reasons of moral hazard and adverse
selection.
In the presence of borrowing constraints, equity is thus exclusively
priced by the middle-aged investors, since the young are effectively excluded
from the equity markets, and we observe a high equity premium.

If the

borrowing constraint is relaxed, the young will borrow to purchase equity,
thereby raising the bond yield. The increase in the bond yield induces the
middle-aged to shift their portfolio holdings from equity to bonds.

The

increase in demand for equity by the young and the decrease in the demand

81

for equity by the middle-aged work in opposite directions. On balance, the
effect is to increase both the equity and the bond return while simultaneously
shrinking the equity premium. Furthermore, the relaxation of the borrowing
constraint reduces the net demand for bonds and the risk-free rate puzzle reemerges.66
In a subsequent paper, Da Silva (2006) generalizes the Constantinides
et al. (2002) restricted participation model to admit habit formation where
the habit coefficients of the old and middle aged differ.67 Using the notation
of this section, the objective function of the period t born representative
agent is

with "1, "2 the habit parameters.

It follows that the MRS and the effective level of risk aversion of the middle
aged agent are, respectively,

It is immediately apparent from (48) that both !1 and !2 appear in the

Bear in mind, however, that the returns reported for this construct are annualized 20-year returns.

for the middle agent.

MRS and that, by (49), the effective CRRA is thus time varying.

Generally speaking, Da Silva and Giannikos (2006) plausibly hypothesize
that !1 > !2 suggesting that the elderly more readily accept consumption
levels altered relative to that of their middle aged working years than do the
middle aged relative to their youth.
The model yields surprisingly good results. In particular, for

! = 2 and ("1, "2 ) = (.7,.2), the premium exceeds 4%. This figure is associated
with standard deviations that match their empirical counterparts quite well
(20% and 7% for the equity and risk free securities respectively); average
returns however are somewhat too high across the board. By (49), the
effective CRRA of the middle aged agent is 3.37 (2.48 for the old agent),
figures that, per se, will not raise eyebrows. Compared to the effective risk
aversion coefficient in Campbell and Cochrane (1999) these figures are
astonishingly low. Generally speaking, a high equilibrium premium can result
even if !1 and !2 are both small, a fact that is not necessarily true of infinite
horizon constructs. A premium of 2.96 is obtained, for example, from a
parameter combination ! = 2, "1 = .30 and "2 = .05. 68 Da Silva’s work is an
example of the case where a small amount of agent heterogeneity goes a long
way towards matching the data. As in representative agent habit models,
risk aversion is effectively stochastic. Nevertheless, returns are stationary
since the MRS depends only on consumption growth rates which are

All figures are obtained in a context where the endowment process is identical to that hypothesized in Constantinides et al.
(2002).

69

The level dependence effects noted in Danthine et al. (2005) are thus absent.
Guvenen (2005) invokes limited participation but within a traditional
infinite horizon production context. In his model, shareholders can trade
stocks and bonds to smooth out their own consumption, while workers can
only trade risk free bonds. Thus limited in their trading opportunities,
workers can only self insure by acquiring bonds, thereby bidding up their
prices, and leading to a low risk free rate. Although shareholders have
multiple

devices

(capital

shares,

in

equilibrium they end up issuing bonds to workers and thus indirectly
providing insurance to them. Not only does Guvenen’s (2005) abstraction
lead to a replication of all the basic financial stylized facts but he is also able
to demonstrate a near equivalence with the habit formation construct of
Campbell and Cochrane (1999).
The restricted participation construct of Guvenen (2005) is related to
the hypothesis that firms’ shareholders directly provide partial income
insurance to their workers in the context of a labor contract (see Danthine et
al. (2007)) in this volume. In either case, the equilibrium outcome is one in
which the wealthier agents with greater access to consumption smoothing
devices end up insuring the less wealthy/restricted access agents. With
regard to replicating the stylized facts, it does not seem important whether
the insurance is provided within the firm or in the financial market. In the
former case, shareholder consumption is more variable as they are residual
claimants: wages essentially leverage their dividend income streams. In the

latter case, (Guvenen (2005)) shareholders have, on net, negative bond
positions: they hold leveraged portfolios, and receive as a result higher risk
consumption streams.
Surely, these alternative mechanisms can be assessed on empirical
grounds – Mehra and Prescott’s (2007) balance sheet analysis of the US
economy emphasizes the latter alternative since wealthy shareholders are
found to be net borrowers in the economy. The actual fact is likely to be a
bit of both. Both alternatives are more appealing – based on more
transparent micro-foundations – than the somewhat higher level abstraction
e.g. of Campbell and Cochrane (1999).
In an important, very recent paper, Gomes and Michaelides (2006) go
beyond Constantinides et.al (2005) by endogenizing stock market participation
(there is a fixed cost to participation and only as agents become sufficiently wealthy
are they willing to pay it) in a production based OLG model where agents experience
idiosyncratic labor income shocks and borrowing constraints (they cannot borrow
against their stochastic life cycle earnings profile). They find that the equity risk
premium is relatively unaffected by the limited participation, and is almost entirely
determined by incomplete risk sharing within the shareholder class. Non stock
market participants are more realistically less wealthy than their counterparts in
Guvenen (2005). In their baseline parameterization they derive an equlibrium
premium of around 4% with a 2.5% risk free rate. The model is itself a new
benchmark and reminds us how the progressive endogenization of previously fixed
decisions can change our perspective on the fundamental drivers of financial
phenomena. It lacks only a standard macro-style labor leisure choice, something that
experience has shown will not be helpful for the task at hand. Nevertheless, Gomes
and Michaelides (2006), appears to be the most comprehensive production
model to date.

85

5. Model Uncertainty
The original Mehra and Prescott (1985) model, as well as all the modifications
considered heretofore in this essay – are rational expectations formulations. As
such, the agents in the model know exactly the environment in which they
operate, including precise knowledge of the stochastic process governing the
evolution of output (also the dividend and consumption) and any other state
variables that arise in more elaborate versions. At best, this is a very strong
assumption.
In reality, the exact form of the relevant stochastic processes is not known
to investors, at least with regard to distribution parameters and it is reasonable
to expect that this ‘model uncertainty’ would itself command a premium. Three
recent papers in this tradition are Mehra and Sah (2002), Barillas et. al. (2006)
and Weitzman (2006).
Mehra and Sah (2002) analyze the consequences of human mood
fluctuations on financial markets. The consequences turn out to be surprisingly
large. They address a very specific question: can small fluctuations in the
subjective discount factor ( ! ) and the risk aversion coefficient ( ! ) of agents
result in large price movements in equity markets? The type of fluctuations that
they consider are those that occur over a short period of time rather than as
secular changes in individual tastes. On a given day, for example, an individual
may be in one of several possible preference states, but he is unaware of these
taste fluctuations and thus does not implicitly incorporate their consequences into
his optimization decisions.
In a variant of the Mehra-Prescott (1985) paradigm, they show that even
changes of small magnitude in ! and ! can have a significant impact on the
evolution of asset prices. Their analysis assumes that taste fluctuations occur
around temporally stable preferences and employs two simplifying assumptions.
First, the growth rate of dividends is assumed to evolve according to a geometric
86

Brownian motion. This allows them to derive a closed form representation for
the equity price in terms of the subjective parameters of interest and the drift
and volatility parameters of the Brownian motion. Second, they assume that
although the parameters change stochastically, the agent’s demands are based on
the assumption that the current realization will prevail forever. Thus the agent,
in his demand for securities, behaves myopically with respect to changes in these
parameters and their analysis has been criticized on this account.
Weitzman (2006) addresses the equity premium, risk-free rate and the
excess volatility puzzles in a pure exchange economy where the representative
agent has standard CRRA preferences. The continuously compounded growth
rate of consumption is assumed to be i.i.d with a Normal distribution. Its mean
and variance however are uncertain. While the first three specifications are
standard, the last differs from the setting in Mehra and Prescott (1985), where
the mean and variance are treated as known parameters that are calibrated to
past sample averages.
The structural uncertainty in the mean and variance of the growth rate
aggregate consumption introduces a form of Bayesian posterior background risk
which is inherited from the prior and which does not converge to zero as the
number of subsequent observations increases to infinity. This background risk
fattens the tails of the posterior distribution of future consumption growth rates
and increases significantly the value of both the equity premium and excess
volatility, while simultaneously decreasing the risk-free rate (as the motivation
for precautionary savings becomes relatively more important than intertemporal
substitution).
In his framework, expected utility fails to exist except when preferences
are logarithmic ( ! = 1).

70

Weitzman circumvents this problem by assuming

that the precision w = 1/! 2 is a truncated-gamma p.d.f. with truncation
70

See Geweke (2001)

87

parameter ! > 0 which represents a lower-bound for the support of the prior
distribution of w. The assumption that 1 /! > " 2 guarantees both the existence
of finite expected utility and that the posterior distribution is in the same form
as the prior, and subject to the same bounding constraint.
In general, with Bayesian learning it should not matter what initial values
are assigned to the parameters characterizing the priors since as the sample size
grows they converge to the true values. In Weitzman’s (2006) context, this holds
true for all model parameters except ! , which controls the convergence
properties of expected utility. The structural parameter ! never loses its critical
impact on the subsequent behavior of agents, regardless of the amount of data
accumulated over time.
One natural concern (and a potential criticism) about the model is that
there is no learning about fundamentals in this setting. If ! does not decline as
the sample size grows, then in what sense is the representative agent learning
through time? In this model the representative agent can never precisely assess
the volatility of consumption growth even if the sample size is infinity.
A second concern is that there is, as yet, no refutable hypothesis. Is the
calibrated optimal value of ! a reasonable one? More importantly how can one
assess whether a value of ! is reasonable? For instance, to account for the
equity premium, it might well be the case that Weitzman is using a low
(reasonable) value of the risk-aversion coefficient, but an unrealistic value of ! .
In Barillas et al., (2006), the agent is in the possession of an
approximating model which he does not entirely trust. This latter fact manifests
itself in the agent postulating a set of unspecified models - which are statistically
similar, as measured by entropy - to his benchmark and which he believes will
govern the data. The consequence of this model uncertainty is to allow an
otherwise standard construct to satisfy the Hansen and Jagannathan (1991)
bounds.
88

6. Concluding Comments
Is the resolution of the equity premium and other financial puzzles
dependent on a wise choice of preference structures alone? There is ample
indication, in many of the models considered in this essay, that certain behavioral
style constructs can come close to such resolution: they work. In many cases,
however, we do not know the axiomatic foundations underlying them or their
behavior in more general settings. In that sense we have very incomplete
knowledge. Yet, the significance of the equity premium and related puzzles
cannot be overstated. The consistency of neoclassical inter temporal economics
would seem to rest, in large measure, on its eventual resolution.
Our sense is that the context of infinitely lived agents may not ultimately
be the most fruitful setting. If one lives forever in a stationary return
environment of complete markets, there is an intuitive sense that small risks
should not matter. Properly measured and accounted for, they should average
out over long horizons. Investors should therefore be largely indifferent to them,
implying a very low premium.
For finitely lived agents nearing retirement, however, the same risks are
critical: a downturn in the stock market is potentially crippling for life, for
example. It is our view that a fully satisfactory resolution of the puzzle is likely
to await more tractable multi-agent models with a richer demographic structure.
