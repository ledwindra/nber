ABSTRACT
Recent globalization trends have refocused attention on the historical evolution of international
capital mobility over the long run. The issue is examined here using time-series analysis of
current-account dynamics for fifteen countries since circa 1850. The inter-war period emerges as an era
of low capital mobility and only recently can we observe a tentative return to the degree of capital
mobility witnessed during the late nineteenth century. The analysis of saving and investment dynamics
also helps make sense of the frequently observed high correlation of saving and investment rates in
historical data.

1. Introduction
Although economic historians have long been concerned with the evolution of
international capital markets over the long run, empirical testing of market integration has been limited. Conventional wisdom suggests that late-nineteenth century
markets were relatively well integrated under the classical gold standard centered
on London; that the inter-war period was one of disintegration and imperfect capital
mobility, especially after 1929; and that the postwar period has been characterized
by gradually increasing capital market integration. 1 This paper seeks to confront
and test such hypotheses by modeling current-account dynamics.
The evolution of international capital mobility is, in principle, closely tied to
the trends and cycles in foreign lending. Yet the presence of flows, is neither a
necessary nor sufficient condition for market integration: a small autarkic country
with a rate of return no different from the “world” market will exhibit no incipient
flows upon opening its capital market. Conversely, countries with substantial barriers
to capital mobility may nonetheless experience capital flows of some sort provided
international rate-of-return differentials are sufficiently large.
Still, despite shortcomings, a substantial literature has evolved using quantity criteria for evaluating capital mobility. An influential contribution was that of Feldstein
and Horioka (FH) (1980) which used data for the 1960s and 1970s on saving and
investment rates to assess whether incremental savings were retained in the home
country or else entered the global capital market seeking out the highest return. The
FH “puzzle” was the surprisingly high correlation of saving and investment, or, put
another way, the very small size of current accounts.
Is it really a puzzle? Methodologically, my main contribution is to go beyond the
traditional cross-sectional FH test, and to offer an alternative time-series approach
based on a more explicit dynamic model. At low frequencies we expect saving and
investment to be highly correlated simply because all countries must abide by a
long-run version of current account balance in order to satisfy their intertemporal
national long-run budget constraint (LRBC).
To give an example, consider a Solovian small-open economy with initial capital
scarcity (capital-labor ratio below steady-state level for a given world interest rate)
and with a zero rate of deterministic exogenous growth. Suppose there are installation costs of capital (or other frictions) that prevent instantaneous adjustment to a
steady-state capital stock. The economy will borrow to invest and will also borrow
to consumption-smooth given its level of permanent income. Saving will be low,
and investment high, at first. But in the long run investment will settle down to a
replacement level as capital approaches its steady-state value, and saving will settle
down to a positive level to offset earlier loans. The current account will reach an
equilibrium, whereby the interest due on debt each period is serviced by a trade
surplus. In steady state, with zero exogenous growth, all real variables are fixed in
levels, so the debt is constant, and hence the equilibrium current account (the change
in debt each period) is zero.

We can show that the precise international finance model is not important here.
The above insight about the LRBC extends to models with non-zero growth and
models of growth with stochastic shocks. Whatever the model, the LRBC is always
invoked as a key axiom. Can we test whether it holds? And what does that imply
for the dynamics of the system? Saving and investment may, in general, have trends
or unit roots; but it can be shown that a sufficient condition for the LRBC to hold is
that the current account be stationary, requiring that investment and saving will be
cointegrated. Hence, a vector error-correction model (VECM) emerges as a natural
theoretical framework, where shocks to saving and investment can be modeled in
the context of a long-run equilibrium relationship between the two. 2
In this paper I develop an applied LRBC framework for studying current-account
dynamics as a tool for assessing capital mobility in a comparative historical setting.
Reassuringly, the empirical results applied to the actual data from the last century tell
a story consistent with the stylized facts. I also find that the results can make sense
of the common FH finding, since the “high” correlation of saving and investment
emerges as a natural implication of the LRBC approach.
The results tell us something of interest about the changing degree of integration
in global capital markets over time. Since our focus is the LRBC condition, our
empirical approach is designed to reveal the changing ability of economies to employ net capital inflows and outflows to escape closed-economy saving-investment
constraints. Of course, this is not the only feature of globalized capital markets, and
a single parameter cannot adequately summarize the various aspects of market integration. A battery of other test on gross capital flows, interest parity, and arbitrage
costs would round out a more complete picture. Though such tests are beyond the
scope of this paper, it suffices to note that they deliver results very consistent with
the picture presented here. 3
2. LRBC and current account dynamics
The theory of the LRBC is well-developed and need not be repeated here in full.
We will be applying it at the level of the national economy, following earlier studies
like Trehan and Walsh (1991), Hakkio and Rush (1991), and Wickens and Uctum
(1993). A brief survey now follows.
Some basic definitions and notation will prove useful. Define gross domestic
product Q as the sum of goods produced, which, with imports M, may be allocated
to private consumption C, public consumption G, investment I , or export X , so
that Q + M = C + I + G + X . Rearranging, GDP is given by GDP ≡ Q =
C + I + G + N X , where N X = X − M is net exports. If the country’s net credit
(debt) position vis-à-vis the rest of the world is B (−B), and these claims (debts)
2

See Jansen (1996); Jansen and Schulze (1996); Miller (1988); Vikøren (1991).
It is debatable whether capital mobility is better measured using models of gross or net
capital movement. Gross flows may reflect integration due to “diversification finance” and
net flows integration due to “development finance”—but the two appear to be often unrelated
(Obstfeld and Taylor 2002).

earn (pay) interest at a world interest rate r , then gross national product is GDP
plus (minus) this net factor income from (to) the rest of the world, GNP ≡ Y =
Q + r B = C + I + G + N X + r B.
It is then straightforward to show that the net balance on the current account C A
satisfies C A ≡ N X + r B = (Y − C − G) − I = S − I , where S ≡ Y − C − G is
gross national saving. Finally, the dynamic structure of the current account and the
credit position is given by the equality of the current account (C A) and the capital
account (K A), with Bt − Bt−1 ≡ K At = C At .
2..1 An economy with zero growth and stochastic shocks
Let us now make the theory of the LRBC concrete. Consider, for example, the deterministic zero-growth Solovian economy mentioned in the introduction. In steady
state, real variables like output Q, income Y , consumption C, capital stock K , assets
B, exports X , imports M, and trade balance N X , all grow at the zero steady-state rate.
Thus, the current account must be zero in steady state, with 0 = Bt − Bt−1 = C At .
Hence, in steady state, 0 = N X + r B, or N X = −r B, and trade surpluses (deficits)
exactly offset interest payments (income) each period.
Is there a way to develop an econometric test of the LRBC suited to a situation
like this? Can it apply even to stochastic settings? Indeed, yes. We know that, when
the interest rate is not constant,
Bt − Bt−1 = rt Bt−1 + N X t .

(1)

Here, change in credit position equals interest on assets plus the current period’s
trade surplus. Following Trehan and Walsh (1991, p. 209), we may iterate this
equation forward in time, solving recursively, to obtain the result that the current
credit (debt) position must be offset, in expected value, by future deficits (surpluses).
Let Rt = 1 + rt with expected value E(Rt+i |It−1 ) = R for all t and i ≥ 0, and let
It be the information of private agents at time t. We can then write
Bt−1 = −

∞


R −( j +1) E(N X t+ j |It−1 ) + lim R −( j +1) E(Bt+ j |It−1 ).
j →∞

j =0

(2)

We define the LRBC hypothesis to be that the last term in 2 must equal zero,
LRBC : lim R −( j +1) E(Bt+ j |It−1 ) = 0,
j →∞

(3)

which states that the present discounted value of the stock of assets must converge
to zero as t tends to infinity.
The key result establishes a sufficient condition for equation 3 to hold:
Proposition 1 If Rt is a stochastic process strictly bounded below by 1 + δ (δ > 0)
in expected value and C At = Bt − Bt−1 is a stationary process, then LRBC holds. 4

Consult Trehan and Walsh (1991, pp. 209–15) for details of the proof.

Note that this test applies to any model with an LRBC axiom. It clearly applies
to all deterministic models. It also allows for stochastic wealth shocks to that may
redistribute wealth across countries, since such shocks are absorbed in the Rt term
(where national net wealth is affected by shocks to the net foreign asset position). We
thus have in this proposition a powerful tool for testing a fundamental assumption
of international macroeconomic models.
2..2 An economy with positive growth and stochastic shocks
Given that I will implement these tests on data that span two centuries, it is
now necessary to see how the theory and testing of the LRBC might change in the
presence of long run growth. Surely this must change the econometric implications,
and intuitively we expect a less-stringent constraint to be relevant. After all, an
economy may be able to “grow out of debt”—debt may not shrink to zero or even
remain constant, but it may grow at a the same steady-state rate slower as the
economy. Can we allow for such possibilities in the model and in the empirics?
Consider again the simple Solvian economy. For simplicity, think first about the
deterministic case. In the steady state, let the world grow at a growth rate g. 5 In any
country, all real variables grow at a rate g also, including income Y , debt B, and the
current account C A. Let 
X denote X/Y for any real variable X . Thus 
B = B/Y

and C
A = C A/Y must be constant in the steady state.
We can now admit a stochastic growth process into the world economy, where all
economies grow at a growth rate gt with G t = 1 + gt , and where E(gt ) = g > 0,
E(G t ) = G > 1. We can easily derive the difference equation for 
B from equation 1.
Given that Bt = Rt Bt−1 + N X t , it follows that

Bt =

Rt


Bt−1 + N

Gt

(4)

Hence the above derivations in equations 1–3 can be applied in an analogous set of
equations with all variables X replaced by 
X and Rt replaced by ρt = Rt /G t . Let
ρ = E(ρt ). The iterated budget constraint becomes

Bt−1 = −




ρ −( j +1) E( N
X t+ j |It−1 ) + lim ρ −( j +1) E( 
Bt+ j |It−1 ),

j =0

(5)

and the new LRBC hypothesis in this context requires the last term to vanish,
Bt+ j |It−1 ) = 0.
LRBC : lim ρ −( j +1) E( 
j →∞

(6)

The sufficient condition for equation 6 to hold follows as an immediate corollary of
the proposition:
5

We suppose that all countries grow at a common steady state growth rate so that no single
country outgrows the rest of the world economy in the long run—for then that country would
be unable to lend or borrow a constant fraction of debt to or from the rest of the world.

4

Corollary 1 If ρt = Rt /G t is a stochastic process strictly bounded below by 1 + δ
(δ > 0) in expected value and C A/Yt is a stationary process, then LRBC holds.
Note that the requirement that E(ρt ) be strictly bounded away from unity can be
viewed as the stochastic equivalent of the condition that the economy be dynamically
efficient, and in the deterministic case it is evidently equivalent to the condition
0 < g < r . In what follows, this condition will be assumed to hold.

3. Capital flows and the LRBC in two centuries
It is the modified version of the LRBC test that we will use next to see if countries
have obeyed their LRBC over the very long run using over 100 years of time series
data for a cross-country sample. I now introduce the basic data to be used in this study.
I collected information on saving ratios S/Y , investment ratios I /Y , and current
account ratios C A/Y for 15 countries covering approximately the period 1870 to
the present. The countries in question are Argentina, Australia, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. 6 .
Since the current account is central to the analysis it is worth spending a moment to
look at the long-run behavior of capital flows in my sample. A sense of the changing
patterns of international financial flows can be gleaned by examining their trends
and cycles. To permit a normalization we look at C A/Y , the size of the current
account balance as a fraction of income.
Figure 1 presents the basic trends in foreign capital flows. Two measures of the
extent of capital flows are used, both of which measure the cross-sectional dispersion
of (C A/Y )it for fixed t, the variance σC2 A/Y,t and the mean absolute value µ|C A/Y |,t .
Quinquennially averaged data are used throughout.
Both measures show similar patterns across time. Consider µ|C A/Y | . The average
size of capital flows in this sample was often as high as 4%–5% of national income
before World War I. At its first peak it reached 5.1% in the overseas investment
boom of the late 1880s. This dropped back to around 3% in the depression of the
1890s. The figure approached 4% again in 1905–14, and wartime lending pushed
the figure over 6% in 1915–19. Flows diminished in size in the 1920s, however, and
international capital flows were less than 2% of national income in the late 1930s.
Again, wartime loans raised the figure in the 1940s, but in the 1950s and 1960s, the
size of international capital flows in this sample declined to an all time low, around
1.3% of national income. Only in the late 1970s and 1980s have flows increased,
though not to levels comparable to those of a century ago.
Flow data, as a quantity criterion, serve only as weak evidence of changing market
integration. However, the data offer prima facie evidence that the globalization of
the capital market has been subject to major dislocations, most notably the inter-war
period, with a dramatic contraction of flows seen in the Depression of the 1930s.
Moreover, this low level in the volume of flows persisted long into the postwar era.

We now turn to more formal tests to see whether this description, and the conventional historiography of world markets that points to the Depression as an era of
disintegration, has broader support. The first important question we ask is whether
the data support the LRBC condition by testing for the stationarity of C A/Y (Corollary 1) using the full time dimension of the data, around 100 years in all cases. Table
1 shows the results of applying the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, with a constant
but no time trend, to the series S/Y , I /Y , and C A/Y for each country in our data
set. 7
The results show that whereas the saving and investment ratios are nonstationary,
the current account-to-GDP ratio is stationary for all countries in the raw data. That
is, every country in our sample appears to be obeying its long-run budget constraint
in the long sweep of history from the late nineteenth century to the present.
This is not to say that, in some periods, countries were unable to run “unsustainable” current account deficits, which were occasionally disrupted by crisis, real
adjustments, or default. Episodes in some countries during the 1890s, 1930s, or
1980s could fit this description, but in the long run analysis we find that such shortrun explosive tenedencies have been, in general, too limited in duration or amplitude
to cause nonstationarity of debt in the Ponzi sense.
Accordingly, our strategy will be to treat such shocks to creditworthiness, ability to pay, country risk, and so on, as a part of the perturbation dynamics of the
system, along with all other real shocks. In modeling we will aim to partition the
system’s behavior between such perturbations and the endoegnous dynamics. Using
this strategy, if the preceding results convince us that these economies have obeyed
the LRBC in the long run, we must now consider what that implies for the dynamics
7

As regards lag selection, the LM test for serial correlation suggested 0 lags in most cases,
with 1 lag on only two occasions. The results with 1 lag are similar to those presented here.

of the current account, saving, and investment, and how we may interpret the results
as a measure of capital mobility.
4. Current account dynamics and capital mobility
It is of interest to do more than just verify that C A/Y is stationary. In fact, the
dynamics of C A/Y can tell us a great deal about capital mobility. We can investigate
the adjustment speed of C A/Y back towards its equilibrium or steady-state value.
To do this I implemented simple AR(1) regressions of the form
(C A/Y )t = α + β(C A/Y )t−1 + t .

(7)

and examined the convergence speed β and error variance σ 2 in each case. I did this
for samples with pooling across space and for each of the 15 individual countries;
and for pooling across time as well as for four subperiods.
I find below that the AR(1) model is an adequate and parsimonious specification
for these purposes. Using the LM test, higher lag orders are not required so that
all the internal dynamics of the model are summarized in the coefficient β, and the
shocks  a random and serially uncorrelated (non-persistent). Thus, interpretation
of the dynamic model is relatively simple.
How should we interpret the model parameters? If β is small (close to zero) we
would infer that the country has a flexible current account and the capacity to run
persistent deficits or surpluses. Conversely, if β is high (close to one) the country
has a rigid current account where deviations from balance are hard to sustain. In
this framework, we might consider the former to be evidence of high capital market

mobility as compared to the latter.
Hence, I take the strong view that β is a summary statistic, derivable from the
dynamic processes of saving and investment (which I consider in a moment) and
pertaining to the ability of countries to externally smooth shocks to saving and
investment. Thus, I consider these parameters to be related to the true, underlying transaction costs that might impede perfect capital mobility—where costs are
broadly construed to include distortions and barriers arising from policies, institutions, and underdevelopment that impinge on the efficient workings of external
capital markets.
How should we interpret the shocks t ? These can be construed as real shocks
to the open economy resulting from a variety of sources: technology, taste, world
interest rates, and so on. These will be considered the forcing terms for the equation,
and for the present purposes assumed to be exogenous. If the error variance σ 2 is
high, it indicates a large range of real shocks to the current account; a small variance
indicates more tranquil times in the external balance.
The parameter β and shocks t clearly have a direct bearing on the FH puzzle.
Feldstein and Horioka coined the term “savings-retention coefficient” to describe
the regression coefficient b in the equations S/Y = a + b(I /Y ) + . Their finding
has been replicated many times, so much so as to be now considered a robust result. 8
Obviously, if capital flows are small, the FH coefficient is bound to be close to unity.
For illustration, the FH test applied to my panel data produces the results shown in
Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 displays the FH coefficient for both five-year and ten-year

averaged data. Figure 3 shows Sinn’s (1992) coefficient for annual data. 9
Now that we have a dynamic AR(1) model of the current account, we see that
the expected variance (for a one country sample, in the time dimension) of C A/Y
is just given by
Var(C A/Y ) =

σ2
,
1 − ρ2

(8)

where ρ = 1 − β is a persistence parameter. Hence, as is intuitively obvious,
countries will only have large current accounts (according to this variance measure
used in Figure 1) if their dynamics allow it: if shocks are large or if the convergence
speed is slow (that is, persistence is high).
This intuition generalizes to AR( p) processes with p lags, provided they are linear
processes, since the variance of the left-hand side of equation 8 is separable into the
effects of the internal dynamics of the system (a function of the coefficients) and
the variance of the error term (which must enter linearly into the variance of the
left-hand side). Thus, one way to resolve the FH puzzle is to see exactly what kind
of sustained current account imbalances the dynamics do in fact permit.
Table 2 and Figure 4 show the results for the AR(1) model. These results are
very striking in that they confirm, for the first time in a dynamic model of current
account adjustment, the stylized facts of the historical literature concerning capital
mobility. 10
Looking first at the pooled data in Table 2 we see that the convergence speed (β)
was very low in the pre-1914 era, about 34% per annum. That is, current account
deviations had a half-life of about 1.5 years, suggesting considerable flexibility to

After 1870 the sample always includes between 12 and 15 countries—not a huge sample,
but comparable in size to Feldstein and Baccheta’s (1991) sample of nine EC countries.

smooth shocks over medium to long horizons. This freedom to adjust was reduced
in the inter-war period, as the convergence speed rose to about 41% per annum,
implying a half-life of about 1.2 years. It was curtailed yet further under the Bretton
Woods era when the convergence speed rose again to 74%, with a half-life now
well under one year. Only in the recent floating period has flexibility returned to the
current account in this sample, with a convergence speed of 32%, not significantly
different from the pre-1914 estimate, though still a little higher as a point estimate.
These findings accord with the notion that the Bretton Woods re-design of the
international financial architecture, as it sought to avoid a repeat of volatile inter-war
conditions, had as its intent a virtual shutting down of international capital markets—
and was very successful in achieving that end. We also find that the contemporary
period looks little different than the gold standard period of a century ago in terms
of current account flexibility.
A brief look at the error variance (σ ) reveals no surprises given our historical
priors. Shocks were largest during the turbulent inter-war years, just as flexibility
started to be lost—despite large shocks measured by σ , the lack of flexibility as
measured by β prevented large flows from developing. Shocks were smallest in
both postwar periods, both during and after Bretton Woods—and that seems entirely
consistent with the long-lasting impact of a highly controlled system designed to
both limit capital mobility and prevent shocks.
The pre-1914 had shocks larger than the postwar period, smaller than the interwar; yet it also had the flexibility to handle them rather well. Thus, the Bretton
Woods re-design was based on a valid premise—high volatility in international
capital markets during the inter-war period. However, it seems clear that the solution
was based not a return to market-based smoothing of shocks, as in the pre-1914 era,
with highly flexible capital flows, but rather an attempt to shut down both the flows
and the shocks themselves.

5. Cross-country variation and the stylized facts
Are such inferences valid in all countries? Is it reasonable to conclude that the
policy reactions of the inter-war period, and their legacy under Bretton Woods,
made the mid-twentieth century a period of low capital mobility? The trouble with
the pooled samples is that they may not be a reasonable sample given the implied
restrictions on the regressions. As Table 2 shows it is easy to reject pooling across
countries, at the 1% level in all cases except the float. It is also the case that the simple
specification with no lags of (C A/Y )t is doubtful, given a specification test on
the inclusion of additional (up to six) lags. With country-by-country estimation, the
absence of a complex lag structure is usually accepted.
Loosening up the specification in this way, whilst allowing us to admit different
dynamics for each country, does not significantly alter our historical interpretation
overall, though it does reveal some interesting heterogeneity of experience. In Figure
4 we see that for most countries the peak in the adjustment speed is experienced
in the Bretton Woods period (9 out of 15 cases). Denmark, France, and Italy are
fairly close, which leaves three other cases. Germany has its peak in the inter-war
period, which is as expected given the severe constraints on borrowing imposed
after Versailles, and only briefly eased by the Dawes plan. Japan has a much larger
peak in the pre-1914 period, which is no surprise given the then-recent advent of
the Meiji reforms. Spain’s pre-1914 peak might be reasonable given that she was
a country on the periphery at that time, and somewhat isolated from the group of
well-integrated gold standard countries by dint of her preference for silver money.
Even so, given wide standard errors, none of these cases present examples where
having a peak in the Bretton Woods era can be definitively rejected.
The error variances also accord well with the pooled results, with peak volatility
in the inter-war period again in 11 out of 15 cases. Unsurprisingly, volatility is much
larger for the smaller economies: the U.S. variance is very small indeed as compared
to countries like Argentina, Australia, Netherlands, and Norway. The Danish case
is also too close to call, and there are three exceptions to worry about once more.
Argentina has its biggest error variance before 1914, which is no news to anyone
familiar with the massive disruptions that caused, and then were caused by, the
Baring Crisis—as massive herding in of foreign capital gave way to a sharp reversal
and several years of austerity and outflows to settle debts. Even so, Argentina’s
inter-war variance is still very high by world standards. Japan and Netherlands also
have high variance before 1914. In each country we have fragile data in this period,
so that is one possible source of noise—as is also true of Argentina. The Dutch were
big players, as capital exporters, in the global capital market at this time, relative to
country size, so that also argues for a volatile external balance. Newly-opened Japan
also might have been exposed as an emerging market, like Argentina, to a good deal
of turbulence in this era relative to the size of their economy. The one other unusual
spike in error variance outside the interwar period—Norway in the Floating era—is
clearly related to a resource shock, the discovery of North Sea oil, an episode that
is by now a textbook example of current account adjustment dynamics.
One would not wish to claim that we can, nor that we should desire, an historical
12

account of this sort to say why each and every parameter has the value it does at
each moment in time. There is an obvious danger of overexplanation. It is merely
worth noting at this juncture that, given the historical priors we have garnered from
various sources over the years—concerning capital market flexibility and the shocks
to the external balances seen over time and across countries—we have been able
to corroborate such claims in a dynamic model of the current account applied to
long-run data.
6. A vector error-correction model of saving and investment
We have shown that the current account ratio C A/Y is stationary. It immediately
follows that the saving and investment ratios, S/Y and I /Y , must be cointegrated,
since C A/Y = S/Y − I /Y is an identity. Hence, without loss of generality, we
can adopt a vector error-correction representation as a dynamic model of saving and
investment. Let s = S/Y , i = I /Y , and let z = C A/Y be the cointegrating term.
Then, the dynamics of s and i take the form,

where we expect γs < 0 and γi > 0, implying that current account deficits (surpluses) bring about adjustment via savings increases (decreases) and investment
decreases (increases).
The model presented here has a very general lag structure, and it is clear that it
implies a more general dynamic model for z = C A/Y than we have seen in the
previous section. Subtracting row two from row one in the above equation, we find
that

where αz = αs − αi , γz = γs − γi , and z = s − i . Only under certain restrictions
would a pure AR representation of C A/Y obtain, independent of lagged S/Y and
I /Y , and this would depend on having identical β coefficients in each row.
The dynamic saving and investment model avoids some of the pitfalls of the
FH approach. The model is not ad hoc, and it does directly account for the LRBC
problem. And because it links to the current account dynamics it gives us a way
of comparing flexibility in the current account to saving and investment dynamics.
In particular, changes in the adjustment speeds γs < 0 and γi > 0 will directly
affect the current account adjustment speed, γz = γs − γi < 0. And changes in
the saving-investment error variance Var(t ) will affect the current account error
variance, Var(z ) = Var(s − i ) = Var(s ) − 2Cov(s , i ) + Var(i ).
13

7. Dynamic model parameters and FH regression implications
We have a dynamic model of s, i , and z = s − i , and we can interpret adjustment
speeds and error variances as telling us something about current account flexibility
and volatility. How do these time-series parameters relate to the FH cross-section
results? Is there any relationship between capital market integration as measured by
the dynamic parameters and the FH coefficient?
To assess this link I undertook the following simulation exercise. First, I fit the
model on actual data. Next, I simulated 100 years of data from a 1900 starting
point for all 15 countries. Then I took the simulated 1990–99 data and performed
cross-section FH regressions. I found the b (FH) coefficient for each simulation, and
repeated for 1,000 simulations. This yielded the distribution of the b coefficient. 11
Next, I repeated the whole exercise for different adjustment speeds γz = γs − γi ,
and different error variances Var(z ) = Var(s − i ). How did I choose a range of
parameters? I took the base calibration of the (s, i ) model and left the lag structure and its parameters unchanged. But I did change convergence speeds and error
variances. I replaced γ with φγ for various multipliers φ, and similarly I replaced
Var() with φVar().
I then tabulated the results so as to see how changes in the underlying dynamic
parameters of the (s, i ) model—the parameters I take as the true measures of the
underlying mobility of capital—affect b, the FH coefficient. 12
Table 3 shows the basic results for changes in one set of parameters at a time.
Holding the error variance fixed, and rescaling the convergence speed in the (s, i )
model shows that faster convergence speeds (of s, i , and, hence, z) are associated
with larger FH coefficients, and the whole range runs from a low of b = 0.5 (when
the convergence speed is cut by a factor of φ = 0.01) to a high of b = 1 (for
φ = 5). 13 This is intuitive: if the current account adjusts very quickly back to zero,
then for a given distribution of shocks we will very rarely see saving and investment

implying that γs and γi had the expected signs, γz = −0.20, and Var(z ) = 0.00073.
12
The first draft of this paper (Taylor 1996) approached the dynamic modeling exercise
with a single-equation ECM model following Jansen and Schulze (1996). The VECM model
developed here is much more general, and does not require a weak-exogeneity assumption
for saving. Using the single-equation ECM framework, in independent work, Jansen (1997)
used a simulation approach to show how parameter shifts in the ECM could affect the crosssectional implied FH coefficient. Our exercise is in the same vein, but it is calibrated to actual
historical processes, whereas Jansen used ad hoc parameter choices to make an artificial
cross-section of countries. We also do not assume a random walk for saving as he did, but
instead model saving as part of a VECM process.
13
When φ > 5 the convergence speed γz exceeds one, the model implies unrealistic oscillations, and the results are suppressed.

taking on unequal values and we would expect a high b estimate.
An alternative experiment holds the convergence speeds fixed and rescales the size
of the error shocks, again using the real data for the base calibration. When I perform
this experiment there is a monotonic relationship of sorts, but the magnitude of the
changes in b are very small as the rescaling of shocks ranges over a multiplicative
factor of 0.02 ≤ φ ≤ 50. This is a very wide range over which to see practically no
variation in the FH parameter (with 0.96 < b < 1). These preliminary results show
that variations in either of the two key parameters of the model (the shock variance
φ and the convergence speed γ ) have an intuitive link to the statistic of interest (the
saving-investment or FH coefficient b).
In Table 3, though, the small response of b to Var(z ) might be the result of
holding γz fixed at a given level; the response could be bigger at other values of
γz . We would really like to know what happens to the FH coefficient when both
parameters (φ, γ ) vary simultaneously and over a wider range. On this question,
the display format of Table 3 appears inadequate for the task of clearly showing
the map from these parameters to the b statistic. Accordingly we turn to a threedimensional graphical display which, though it requires careful interpretation, may
better illustrate the range of results possible in this framework.
Figure 5 plots the mapping from various imposed (φ, γ ) pairs on the horizontal
plane, to the implied value of b of the vertical axis. The figure confirms that at slower
convergence speeds (smaller levels of γz ), higher volatility (larger Var(z )) translates

into a lower value of b, the FH coefficient. This is also an intuitive finding: bigger
disturbances in the (s, i ) model, should, holding the convergence speed constant,
lead to bigger differences between saving and investment levels in each country,
and, hence, a lower correlation of s and i in cross section. 14
Thus, we find that simulated data from the dynamic model generate a range of FH
coefficients between 0.5 and 1, an interval that encompasses the actual range seen
in most FH tests, and which explains why truly small FH parameters (close to zero)
are unlikely ever to be seen in practice. Thus, we might even claim to have attained
some kind of holy grail: a meaningful, albeit deformed, yardstick for the FH tests
can be based on these simulations. Very low convergence speeds can push b as low
as about 0.5—but rarely lower in practice; so this is a plausible lower extreme on the
scale. Conversely, fast convergence speeds soon push b close to one, the plausible
high extreme on the scale.

1-year and 5-year averaging.

8. Conclusion
This paper has related saving and investment patterns in cross section to formal
time series properties implied by intertemporal budget balance. Econometric estimation and simulation exercises apply a VECM model and show that dynamic
model parameters for a panel of 15 countries over 100 years deliver a plausible
interpretation of changes in global capital mobility consistent with the conventional
wisdom of our traditional historical narratives.
Our modeling strategy can also help shed some light on the supposed FedlsteinHorioka “puzzle.” As is well known, there are a number of theoretical models that
can deliver an FH “puzzle” even with capital mobility. Under certain parameter
assumptions, and with a particular market structure, these models deliver a positive
saving-investment association. It is of empirical interest, however, to know whether
such models apply in practice.
Using the calibration methods above, we find that the underlying dynamics of
saving and investment in our historical sample tend to generate a monotonic relationship between current account persistence parameters, shock variances, and the
estimated FH coefficient. So, in this real-world application at least the often asserted
relationship between the FH parameter and underlying measures of mobility appears
to be valid.
Are the conclusions limited and model-specific? They should not be. The LRBC
must be a common feature of all useful models in international finance, with or
without growth, whether deterministic or stochastic. From the LRBC restriction,
certain implied time-series dynamics for debts and the current account must follow—
dynamics that must resemble the models estimated here.
Given the fragility of inference in the FH regression, a time-series approach offers
a more direct method of evaluating capital mobility, one that might be preferred for
its richer description of dynamics, its firmer basis in the theory of the long run budget
constraint, and its ability to detect country-specific differences in the world capital
market. Future studies might extend this result with applications to other samples,
and closed-form solutions might arise in some classes of models.
It would also be helpful to see the dynamic model coefficients derived from the
deep parameters (describing tastes, technology and other processes) of optimizing
open-economy models, or at least their linearization around steady states. There the
current account dynamics might depend on other real state variables (like output,
investment, and government spending shocks, as in real business cycle models) and
nominal variables (like exchange rate, price, and money shocks as in models with
rigidities).

implicitly, via the current account identity, as the investment rate (I /Y )t plus the ratio of the
