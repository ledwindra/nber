The Distortionary Effects of Incentives in Government: Evidence from China's “Death Ceiling”
Program

NBER Working Paper No. 23098
January 2017
JEL No. D73,H75
ABSTRACT
We study a 2004 program designed to motivate Chinese bureaucrats to reduce accidental deaths.
Each province received a set of ‘death ceilings’ that, if exceeded, would impede government
officials' promotions. For each category of accidental deaths, we observe a sharp discontinuity in
reported deaths at the ceiling, suggestive of manipulation. Provinces with safety incentives for
municipal officials experienced larger declines in accidental deaths, suggesting
complementarities between incentives at different levels of government. While realized
accidental deaths predict the following year's ceiling, we observe no evidence that provinces
manipulate deaths upward to avoid ratchet effects in the setting of death ceilings.

Introduction

The tradeo between motivating agents and distorting their eorts is central to incentive
design. As emphasized in Holmstrom's (1979) classic model, this tradeo is starker for dicult

rewards may be optimal.

In these cases weak or even at

Holmstrom's insight in turn has implications for the design and

assignment of tasks within an organization (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991), and even the
assignment of tasks across organizational types: when viewed through the lens of incentive
design, non-prots or government may be seen as a contractual solution to the problem of
imperfect observability (see, for example, Easley and O'Hara (1984) and Dixit (1997)).
Against this backdrop, there has been an active debate - both in academic and policy
circles - on the appropriateness of using performance incentives in bureaucracies. Such practices are common: teachers are assessed based on standardized test-based value-added scores
(Springer et al, 2014), FBI agents on the production of intelligence leads (Gulati et al, 2009),
and police ocers on arrest and crime data (Eterno and Silverman, 2012). In each of these
settings, much of the debate has centered around the extent to which outcome metrics are
manipulable.
We study the eect of incentives on the manipulation of reported outcome measures in
the context of a high-stakes safety targeting program implemented by the Chinese central
government.

Our primary contribution is to show that, even under conditions where ex

ante one would expect that gaming of the outcome measure would be dicult or impossible,
there is still widespread manipulation. This naturally raises concerns about the ever wider
application of incentives in bureaucracies.
In February 2004, the State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS), the national safety
regulatory authority, announced a set of province-level safety targets, or `death ceilings,'

time, Wang Xianzheng, described the measure as a response to a worrying increase in severe
(and well-publicized) accidents in the preceding months. The new rules targeted a reduction
in accidental deaths of 2.5 percent for 2004, with further targeted reductions expected in
future years. Provinces were required to develop their own plans for getting accidental deaths
below the mandated ceilings, and to provide quarterly reports on workplace deaths for a
number of industries (e.g., coal mining; agriculture; manufacturing), and also total deaths
from trac accidents or re.
SAWS publicized provinces' quarterly death numbers by category, along with their yearend ceilings, via news releases that were in turn published in the national newspaper, the

People's Daily.

At least supercially, these reforms were a resounding success: deaths across

all categories fell by about 45 percent between 2005 and 2012, an annual decline of nearly 8
percent.
When we delve more deeply into the public data, however, we show that it was very
likely that manipulation of death statistics played a signicant role in the reduction. Using
McCrary's (2008) test for manipulation of a running variable applied to the distributions of
year-end deaths-to-ceiling ratios in each category, we nd a clear discontinuous drop in the
density function around one, an indication of `sorting' of reported deaths around the ceiling.

2

By contrast, we observe no discontinuity for cumulative deaths through the rst three

quarters of the year.
We next examine cross-province heterogeneity in hitting safety targets, in particular examining the eects of No safety, no promotion (NSNP) laws for local regulators. As noted
above, the 2004 SAWS directive gave considerable discretion to individual provinces in improving safety performance. Starting in 2005, provinces established rules for disaggregating
province-wide death ceilings into municipal-level ceilings, and some went as far as tying local
ocials' promotion to hitting their (local) targets. We show that the provision of local incentives via NSNP was eective in reducing province-level deaths (though this relationship is
signicant only at the 10 percent level). This is consistent with a complementarity between
local and province-level governments in achieving safety targets.
If reducing deaths below government-mandated ceilings comes in part through manipulation, it raises the question of why we observe any discontinuity at all: why not manipulate
reported deaths

well

below the ceiling? There are a number of potential explanations. First,

death misclassication may be costly, and plausibly convex in the extent of manipulation,
an issue we discuss in Section 2.2. Further, if ceilings are set as a function of past reported
deaths, reducing deaths by too much could lead to a ratchet eect with ever-lower ceilings
as a result of performing too well in the present year. As evidence that ratchet eects would
present a concern to ocials, we show that year-end deaths are an extremely strong predictor
of the following year's ceiling, even after accounting for lagged ceilings. Despite this, we do
not nd any evidence that ocials went so far as to manipulate reported deaths

upward

to

secure more favorable ceilings in future years, based on a comparison of pre- versus post2004 growth rates in industrial workplace deaths. The bottom quartiles of the pre-2004 and
post-2004 distributions are virtually identical, so that provinces were just as likely to have
very low reported deaths before and after the advent of death ceilings.

The distributions

diverge primarily at positive growth rates, consistent with strong pressures to report declines
in accidental deaths in the post-2004 period.
We conclude our overview of the results by emphasizing that we cannot rule out a real

gories may be less subject to manipulation and/or control.

response from the imposition of death ceilings. While the sharp discontinuities around the
ceiling that we document in our main analysis are most easily reconciled with responses to
safety incentives via manipulation rather than real safety improvements, we cannot distinguish
whether safety improvements occurred as well. The clustering in reported deaths we observe
around 90 to 100 percent of the ceiling could be the result of a real drop in high-mortality
outcomes (accompanied by manipulation to ensure the nal gure remains below the ceiling).
It could alternatively be reconciled with a pure manipulation story with an audit probability
that is greater just below the ceiling. In the absence of reliable data on industry output or
safety expenditures, we cannot fully rule out these types of alternative explanations.
Our paper contributes to the large body of work within economics on the consequences
of high-powered incentives, and the challenges of incentive design more broadly. While this
work has primarily involved for-prots (see, for example, Oyer (1988) for a classic study on
the topic), we examine the increasingly common phenomenon of high-powered incentives in
governmental and/or non-prot settings. Recent work in economics has considered specically
how these incentives lead to manipulation of reported outcomes, in China and elsewhere. Most
notably, Young (2003) argued that China's extraordinary GDP growth during the last two

decades of the twentieth century was the result of distortions in reporting.

study manipulation of outcomes around a threshold to study agents' responses to incentives,
using approaches similar to ours. Duo et al (2013) analyze the manipulation of pollution
data by third-party auditors of industrial plants in Gujarat, while Dee et al (2011) study
whether New York City teachers alter students' Regents' exam scores (the authors attribute
manipulation to teachers' desires to help their students rather than concern for their own
evaluations).
The results we present have particular relevance for the literature on the tradeos associated with decentralization. As Mookherjee (2006) emphasizes in his survey on decentralization in hierarchies, central administrators may have limited knowledge of local conditions,
and their interests may diverge from those of local ocials. This may lead to moral hazard
that undercuts the benets of local knowledge.

Our study brings this tradeo into sharp

relief in an empirically important setting, given its distorting eects on reporting behavior.
A further benet of decentralization emphasized by more recent research is that it allows
higher-level policymakers to assess bureaucrats' quality (Mookherjee, 2015). Our results suggest, however, that the tournament model of government promotion may be undermined if
performance metrics are subject to manipulation. In our context reported safety outcomes
may still contain some information - as in the earnings management literature, a manager
only misses the mandated target if his organization is in truly terrible shape (Burgstahler
and Dichev, 1997) - but it does not provide the ne-grained signal that would be obtained in

have strongly disputed these claims. See Chow (2006) and Holz (2014).

the absence of manipulation.
Finally, our ndings also may serve as a counterweight to the trend toward increased
focus on evaluation based on observable performance metrics, providing a cautionary tale
on the complications associated with the use of metrics-based evaluation and incentives for
hard-to-measure outcomes that are subject to manipulation. The outcome we focus on here
- accidental deaths - is one that is plausibly less subject to manipulation than many other
outcomes of social interest.
In the next section, we provide background information on the safety reforms of 2004 and
an overview of the data. In section 3 we present our main results. We provide concluding
comments in section 4.

Background and Data

2.1 The death ceiling system in China
On January 9, 2004, the State Council of China, the country's highest administrative
authority, issued a document whose title translates roughly as

Further Enhancing Work

Decision of the State Council on

Safety.4 In addition to re-emphasizing the importance of workplace

safety, the decision stated as an objective that by 2020, China's safety record should be
comparable to those of other middle-income countries.

The document also specied that

safety targets would need to be set at the national and subnational levels, starting in 2004.
Finally, the decision specied that beginning in 2004, provincial governments would have to
provide quarterly reports on accidental fatalities to the State Administration of Worker Safety
(SAWS), which in turn would publicize these reports. (SAWS is the country's workplace safety
regulator, reporting directly to the State Council.)
As a response to the State Council decision, the Work Safety Commission of the State
Council issued a further directive,

Opinions on Setting up a Death Ceiling System,

which

provided a specic target of 2.5 percent for accidental death reductions nationally. Working
with SAWS, the Work Safety Commission further set safety targets for each province in China,
providing ceilings for a variety of industries, including: Agriculture; Chemical production;
Coal mining; Construction; Fireworks; Railway; and Industrial, Non-coal mining, commercial,
and trade (IMCT). Additionally, ceilings were assigned by severity of workplace accident,

including Severe (3 or more deaths) and Very Severe (10 or more deaths). Two nal categories
- which included both workplace and non-work fatalities in their totals - were also assigned
ceilings:

Road and Fire.

We conjecture that these were included because they are more

visible and salient to the general population than, say, fatalities due to poisoning or falls,
which are nonetheless the cause of a high proportion of accidental fatalities. Finally, a ceiling
was assigned for the overall number of deaths across all industries and categories (Overall).
In practice, gures for a number of less prominent categories went unreported, and in
what follows we focus on the year-end ceilings in the eight categories where at least half of
province-year death totals and ceilings were available, including Overall; Agriculture; Coal
mining; Fire; Road; Railway; IMCT; and Severe.

Given the non-independence of these

categories (e.g., many severe accidents take place in coal mining, and all subcategories sum
to the overall gure) and potential serial correlation, we will allow for province-level clustering
of standard errors.
Starting in the second quarter of 2004, SAWS collected reported deaths and death ceilings
on a quarterly basis, which were then published in the

People's Daily.

In the program's rst

year, most categories went unreported, so we begin our sample in 2005.

SAWS stopped

publishing reported deaths and death ceilings at the end of 2011, and the gures were not
reported in the rst and third quarters of 2007 and 2008, as well as the rst half of 2005. We
requested information on reported deaths and ceilings from SAWS for the dates that were not
publicly available, and received supplemental data for 2007 and 2008, as well as the fourth
quarter of 2012.

6 While the target system remained in place at the time of writing, data

were no longer reported publicly after 2012. Thus, our data include quarterly observations
from 2005 through to the end of 2011, as well as the year-end total for 2012.
As part of their eorts at meeting province-level ceilings, some provinces adopted No
safety, no promotion (NSNP) policies that made promotion of local government ocials
contingent on meeting the death ceilings set for their region by the provincial government.
Guangdong was the rst to adopt this policy in 2005, while others followed suit only several
years later.

As of June 2015, 20 provincial authorities, out of a total of 31, had adopted

NSNP policies.

Note that NSNP applies to local ocials - that is, it is set by

ocers to evaluate

local

ocials.

provincial

We list the dates of the passage and implementation of

NSNP policies for each province in online Appendix Table A1, which shows that a number
of NSNP laws were passed during our sample period of 2005 - 2012. This will allow us to
exploit within-province variation in identifying the eects of NSNP on accidental deaths.

6 SAWS

stated that, since gures were not published in the rst two quarters of 2005 and 2012, they

could not provide the information to us, and we cannot infer from their response whether they simply do not
have the information, or have it but are unwilling to share it. For the third quarter of 2012, SAWS did not
collect accidental death information from provincial governments, because of the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China.

2.2 Anecdotal evidence of gaming of deaths
From the outset, the death ceiling system was controversial, with manipulation of reported
gures thought to be widespread. An in-depth report published in the

Southern Weekly

(Hao,

2007), for example, described one common (albeit costly) means of manipulating road deaths:
If an individual was severely wounded in a trac accident, it would be classied as a road
accident (and count toward the road ceiling) only if the individual died within seven days. If
the death occurred eight or more days after the accident took place, it would be classied as
a natural death. This created an incentive to keep accident victims alive for at least a week,
especially when close to the year-end ceiling.
For workplace deaths, problems around ambiguities in death classications led SAWS to

issue a

issuance provides evidence in itself of the inevitable discretion involved in classifying deaths.
It claries, for example, that accidental deaths at unlicensed rms should be classied as
workplace deaths. However, as pointed out by Su (2011), the note had no legal authority, and
the various liberties in classifying deaths that it describes likely continued after its publication.
Deaths were also thought to be under-reported by the local governments responsible for
providing these gures to provincial ocials (Shanghai Law Journal, 2007), following the Chinese adage that translates as Village tells a lie to town, town then tells another lie to county,
until the lie reaches the state council.

8 As we argue below, the imposition of No safety, no

promotion laws may have helped to better align the interests of ocials at dierent levels of
government, thus improving their ability to collude on reported deaths.

2.3 Data
We hand collected province-level quarterly reported deaths and corresponding death ceiling data for each category from the

People's Daily

for 2005 - 2012. For most categories in

most years, we have data for all quarters except, as noted in Section 2.1 above, the rst two
quarters of 2005 and the rst three quarters of 2012.

included in Overall, a ratio of 80 percent is in line with comparable gures from other countries. (For example, the ratio of trac deaths to workplace deaths in the U.S. is about eight

to one. )
The gures in Table 1, when put in per capita terms, also suggest that under-reporting was
likely a serious problem even in the earliest years of the death ceiling program. For example,
there were 98,738 reported Road deaths in 2005, or about 7.6 per 100,000 population, about

argued that the problem of misrepresenting trac fatality gures has increased

since 2004, precisely the period we consider in our analysis (Alcorn, 2011). Aggregating across
all categories of workplace fatalities, the ocial gures in Table 1 imply a Chinese workplace

under-reporting.
We next dene an indicator variable

to denote the province-year observations

when No safety, no promotion regulations were in place; it takes on a value of one starting
in the year following the passage of NSNP regulations (though our results are not sensitive
to this treatment of the year of implementation).
For most accidental death categories, data are unavailable outside the public reporting
window of 2005 - 2012. However, deaths in the IMCT category are available through a variety
of sources for 1993 - 2003, excluding 1998. The 1993 - 1997 IMCT death data were collected
from the China Labor Yearbooks; 1999 from the China Economics and Trade Yearbook; and
2000 - 2003 from China's Worker Safety Yearbooks.

with realized real GDP data (GDP Growthpy ) to dene

3.1 Discontinuities around the targeted number of deaths
We begin with a series of graphs showing of the distribution of

Deathscpy /Ceiling cpy ,

c, and test for manipulation around the SAWS-mandated
ceiling (recall that p indexes province and y indexes year). We use McCrary's (2008) test for a
disaggregated by death category

discontinuity in the distribution of

Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy

around a value of one, the threshold

for meeting the safety target. McCrary's test involves estimating local linear regressions of
the density on either side of the cuto (in our case, around one), and using a Wald test to
check whether the predicted number of observations at the cuto is the same for the two local
linear regressions. If the predicted frequencies are dierent, it suggests that sorting around

13

the cuto is non-random.

In Figure 1, we show a histogram of

Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy

for overall province-level ac-

cidental deaths, with a bin width of 0.077, chosen to match the bin width that will be used
by McCrary's density test. A discontinuity is clearly discernable at one. Figure 2 presents
the McrCrary density test, providing the local linear regressions on either side of 1 (as noted
previously with a bin width of 0.0077). The gap between the density estimates on either side
is -2.72, and a z-statistic of the dierence of -4.23 (p-value < 0.001).

the third-quarter distributions are smooth.

We can, for example, reject the presence of a

discontinuity at 0.75 at least at the 10 percent level for all categories except coal, where we
obtain a p-value of the dierence at the cuto of 0.028 - an even sharper discontinuity occurs
at a value of 1 for coal, however, as many observations are already close to the year-end
threshold by the end of Q3. Thus, the discontinuity in the distribution of accidental deaths
emerges only in the nal quarter of each year.

3.2 Eect of local incentives
We next assess whether provinces are better able to improve their safety records (and
meet their safety targets) after implementing No safety, no promotion (NSNP) incentives
for local ocials.

We do so by comparing death rates and probabilities of meeting safety

targets, pre- versus post-NSNP. Owing to the relative sparseness of the data, we perform this

xed eects, which has very little impact on the estimated coecients. While the coecient
on

N SN Ppy

is noisily measured across all specications, its economic magnitude is large,

indicating that NSNP laws are associated with a 10 percentage point decrease in the likelihood
of exceeding the year-end ceiling. Given the average probability that

province-year observations, this implies a 50 percent reduction in

the likelihood of exceeding the ceiling as a result of NSNP incentives. (Our regression results
are roughly in line with the simple pre-versus-post dierence in means for provinces that

16

implement NSNP incentives during our sample period, of 0.19 versus 0.12.)

N SN P status. Interestingly, for the portion of the distribution
below Deathscpy /Ceiling cpy = 1, the cdf for N SN P = 1 province-year observations is virtually identical to that of the cdf for N SN P = 0 observations, before diverging just below one.
In Figure 3 we show the cumulative density functions for

categories, disaggregated by

This suggests that

NSNP

incentives reduced deaths primarily by lowering the likelihood of

exceeding safety targets - conditional on meeting the target, the two distributions are quite
similar.

3.3 Death targets and ratchet eects
If manipulation is responsible for much of the discontinuity around safety targets, it naturally raises the question of why bureaucrats do not manipulate gures downward to an even
greater extent. Convex manipulation costs and, relatedly, higher audit probabilities for suspiciously low values, are possible reasons that reported deaths might not be manipulated far
below the ceiling.

There must be at least some cost to manipulation under some circum-

stances, else provinces would never exceed their ceilings at all (though we have no record
of government investigations related to manipulation beyond the non-binding guidelines reported in Section 2.2). If ocials wish to avoid attention or scrutiny, there would again be

16 If

we employ the continuous measure of safety compliance,

cients on

NSNP

Deathscpy /Ceilingcpy ,

the estimated coe-

are all negative, though none is signicant at the 10 percent level. This is consistent with

NSNP acting rst and foremost to motivate provinces to get deaths gures below their ceilings, but the data

are far too noisy to distinguish between a general decline in deaths and a drop only below the ceiling.

11

at least some check against extreme manipulation.
A further explanation may be due to concerns over a ratchet eect, where good performance - beating the death ceiling by a wide margin - induces a harsher (i.e., lower) ceiling
the following year. Ratchet eects may appear in any setting where next period's target is
a function of this period's performance. In Figure 4, we show the raw relationship between

log(Deathscpy−1 )

and

log(Ceilingcpy ).

Observations line up on or near the 45 degree line.

(The very strong one-to-one relationship persists even if we remove province, category, and
year eects.) The same pattern could be generated by persistence in target-setting, for example, given the high concordance between targeted and reported year-end deaths. In Table 3,

log(Deathscpy−1 )
and log(Ceiling cpy−1 ) as regressors in predicting the current target log(Ceilingcpy ). As shown

we attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities by including both

in columns 1 and 2, each variable is highly signicant when included on its own (p-value <

log(Ceiling cpy−1 ) delog(Deathscpy−1 ) is virtually unchanged

0.001). When both are included together in column 3, the coecient on
clines by about 85 percent, whereas the coecient on

(though its standard error increases somewhat, the p-value remains below 0.001). In column
4 we allow for the interaction of lagged reported deaths and

I(Deathscpy−1 > Ceiling cpy−1 ),

to account for the possibility that bureaucrats, recognizing concerns over ratchet eects, untether the link between reported deaths and next year's ceiling at lower deaths-to-ceiling
ratios. The interaction term is small in magnitude (-0.006) and statistically insignicant; we
thus nd no evidence that the relationship between lagged deaths and current ceiling changes
as lagged deaths move below the ceiling.
If the static impact of death ceilings is a downward manipulation of reported deaths (as
documented in the rst part of our paper), dynamic concerns may create incentives for upward manipulation in order to secure a more favorable ceiling the following year.

17

We

attempt to shed some light on the question of upward manipulation by comparing the preand post-2004 distributions of accidental deaths.

As we note in the Section 2.3, the only

category where pre-2004 death gures are available is IMCT. If upward manipulation takes
place to secure favorable future targets, we expect that the accidental death growth rate,

%∆Deathscpy =

Deathscyp
Deathscpy

− 1,

would have relatively few low values for post-2004 data, as

compared to the pre-2004 data. In Figure 5, we show the cumulative density functions for
the pre- and post-2004 distributions of

%∆Deaths.

Interestingly, the two functions are near-

identical over the bottom quartile of their distributions; if death gures had been inated as
a result of ratchet eects, we would have expected the post-2004 distribution to be shifted
to the right at low levels. We thus nd no obvious indication in the data of upward manipulation in deaths in response to ratchet eect concerns. At about the 25th percentile, just as

17 In

contrast to downward manipulation, we know of no clearcut anecdote of fabricated deaths to articially

raise the accidental death count closer to the ceiling.

12

the growth rate approaches -10 percent, the lines diverge sharply, a natural eect of death
ceilings being set relatively close to lagged values of

Deaths (and hence the ceiling constraint

starting to bind at this level).

Conclusion
We examine the consequences of a high-stakes incentive program that aimed to improve

safety practices in China.

We argue that the sharp discontinuities in the deaths-to-ceiling

distributions across all accident categories are strongly suggestive of a downward manipulation
of reported deaths.
Our ndings may be seen as a cautionary tale on the use of incentives based on performance
metrics in bureaucracies. However, in the absence data on actual accidental deaths or credible
data on industrial production, there are several caveats in considering the policy implications
of our results. First, it is dicult to assess whether the incentive program we study had

any

real eect on safety (as distinct from the eect on manipulation) or economic activity. This
limits our ability to make a general assessment of the welfare eects of the program. Nor can
we say denitively whether the program was suboptimal in its design: that would require a
full-blown cost-benet assessment that included assumptions about what safety might have
been like under alternative regimes.
We note nally that it is not clear whether the death ceiling program failed to achieve
its objective, from the perspective of the implementing authority, as that would require a
further set of assumptions about the China State Council's objective function. China's central government is plausibly interested in dissent minimization.

If this is accomplished by

reporting year-on-year death reductions across all accident categories, regardless of realities
on the ground, then performance improvements through manipulation may be a perfectly
acceptable result.
These caveats nonetheless suggest a number of ways forward. First, more detailed data
or a dierent setting may allow for a more ne-grained distinction between manipulation and
eort as the source of reported improvements.

More importantly, we may be able to use

the choice of incentives to better understand the functioning and objectives of governments
themselves.

Notes: The first set of columns provide summary statistics on year-end accidental deaths in each listed
category at the province-level. The second set of columns provide summary statistics on the year-end ratio
of reported deaths to the government mandated death ceiling. The IMCT category includes workplace
deaths in industrials, non-coal mining, commercial, and trade; severe accidents are deaths in accidents that
involve three or more fatalities. Other death categories are self-explanatory (see text for details).
