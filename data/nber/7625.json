    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the implications of portfolio theory for the cross-sectional behavior of equity trading volume.  Two-fund separation theorems suggest a natural definition for trading activity: share turnover.  If two-fund separation holds, share turnover must be identical for all securities.  If (K+1)-fund separation holds, we show that turnover satisfies an approximately linear K-factor structure.  These implications are examined empirically using individual weekly turnover data for NYSE and AMEX securities from 1962 to 1996.  We find strong evidence against two-fund separation, and a principal-components decomposition suggests that turnover is well approximated by a two-factor linear model.\n\n",
