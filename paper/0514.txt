       Demographic Differences m Cyclical Employment Variation




                                ABSTRACT


      This paper examines the demographic patterns of cyclical swmgs

in the labor market by decomposing movements in employment into

changes in unemployment and participation.     Differences in labor market

experience by age, sex, race, and enrollment in school are considered,

and implications for .aggregate demand policy are assessed.     The results

confirm the iJrportance of the participation rate in affecting the

cyclical behavior of both employment and une.1T!Ployment.   A key finding

is that young workers bear a disproportionate share of cyclical fluc-

tuations.   Moreover, the evidence suggests that the e.1T!Ployment experience

of high unemployment demographic groups appears to be insensitive to

aggregate demand conditions because of the surge in participation which

accompanies increased e.1T!Ployment opportunities.   Without participation

fluctuation, expansionary .aggregate demand could reduce the UTIe.1T!Ployment

rate of almost every demographic group to a very low level.

          The cyclical behavior of employment and unemployment is a

dominant feature of labor markets.     Cyclical fluctuations in economic

activity affect the labor market experience of all demographic groups.

Wnile the unemployment rates of different demographic groups move together,

the levels about which they fluctuate and the amplitude of cyclical

fluctuations differ greatly.     These differences suggest that understanding

the, cyclical character of labor markets requires explicit examination of

the experience of individual groups.l Moreover, an assessment of the welfare

implications of alternative policies requires consideration of the incidence

of costs and benefits.

          The cyclical sensitivity of unemployment is a reflection of two

quite different phenomena.     Unemployment can increase either because fewer

jobs are available or because more workers decide to seek the available jobs.

These two sources of unemployment have different welfare implications.       While

the former is almost certainly indicative of a worsening labor market

performance, the latter may reflect an improvement in conditions.      Focus only

on unemployment rates is thus very likely to be misleading~ Recent experience

illustrates the point.   During 1977 the unemployment rate fell by about one

percentage point.   If participation had remained constant, the large gains

in employment during that year would have caused more than a two point decline

in the unemployment rate.    Similarly, a constant participation rate over the

last two years would have led to an unemployment rate below five percent today.

          The ambiguous character of fluctuations in    unemploy~ent   suggests

that analysis of cyclical behavior will be improved by simultaneous examination

of movements in employment and participation.     In this paper we analyze the

demographic patterns of cyclical swings in the labor market by decomposing

movements in employment into changes in unemployment and participation.

The paper focuses on the interrelations among participation, employment and

unemployment, with particular emphasis on the participation rate as a prime

determinant of the labor market experience of various demographic      g~oups.


          The first section briefly reviews the evidence indicating the importance

of participation fluctuations.   The empirical model is described and several
                                                                                      "



variants are discussed.   The second section of the paper discusses the empirical

results for various groups.   Differences in labor market experience by age,

sex, race, and enrollment in school are considered.     The results confirm the

importance of the participation rate in affecting the cyclical behavior of

both employment and unemployment.     A key finding is that young workers

bear a disproportionate share of cyclical fluctuations.       For example, teen-

agers, who comprise only 9 percent of the population, account for more than a

quarter of employment fluctuations.     The third section of the paper analyzes

in greater detail the impact of aggregate demand policy on high unemployment

demographic groups.   It is sometimes suggested that these groups have structural

problems upon which expansionary policy has a small impact.      We show

that this conclusion results from ignoring movements in the participation

rate.   These groups have high unemployment rates in times of very strong macro-

economic performance only because of the surge in participation which accompanies

increased employment opportunities.    Without participation fluctuations,

expansionary aggregate demand could reduce the unemployment rate of almost

every demographic group to a very low level.     The fourth    and final section of

the paper summarizes our conclusions and discusses some of their implications.

Section I: Labor Force Participation and the Cyclical Behavior of Labor Markets

            The rate of labor force participation is a fundamental measure of

labor market activity.   As a measure of the supply of labor, participation

has been widely studied using aggregate time series and cross-section data.

Mincer's well-known studies (Mincer (1962), (1966)) demonstrated

th~   importance of participation   f1uctuatiQn~


in understanding employment fluctuations, especially among women.       It is

now widely recognized that structural changes in the labor market (e.g. the

minimum wage) must be understood in terms of their impact on participation

and employment, as well as unemployment.       These insights have generally

not been applied to the analysis of cyclical behavior.      While many recent

studies   have examined fluctuations in participation (e.g., Wachter (1972, 1977),

Perry (1977», and demographic unemployment rates (e.g., Feldstein (1973), Feldstein

and Wright (1976)), relatively little effort has been directed at linking

participation and unemployment dynamics together to explain employment

fluctuations.

           The connections among participation, unemployment and employment can

be seen in the following identity:


                                                                  (1)


where E is employment, N is population, L is labor force and i indexes

demographic groups.   The employment ratio (proportion      of the population

employed) is the product of the participation rate, and the employment rate

(one minus the unemployment rate).     Fluctuations in the fraction of the

population employed thus can be decomposed into the change in the rate of

unemployment and the growth of participation.        Expressing (1) in logs
                                            - 4 -

and differentiating yields the basic decomposition:


                             E             E
                        dIn (N) 1." = dIn ( \
                                              Ll.i
                                                     + dIn (L)
                                                            N i                 (2)

Since persons in the labor force are either employed or unemployed it is clear that:


                        dIn   (i) i   =   dIn (l-UR\ + dIn    (~) i           (3)

where UR is the unemployment rate. 3

           The results of this decomposition for 1972-1977, presented in Table 1, clearly

indicate the importance of fluctuations in participation during the past few

years.   For women, changes in participation are generally much larger than

changes in the rate of unemployment.          On average, variation in the rate of

participation accounts for 70 percent of the variation in the female employment

ratio.   While a much smaller variation in participation has been observed in

the total population, the fluctuations are still substantial relative to

movements in the unemployment rate.         Table 1 thus underscores the

need to examine the interrelations among employment, unemployment and

participation in analyzing cyclical fluctuations in labor markts.           Below

our method of doing this is outlined.


The Empirical Model

          For each demographic group we postulate that unemployment and

participation rates are functions of aggregate demand and time.            The time

trends are included to reflect the impact of slowly changing social fac tors,

and other gradually moving variahles omitted from the equation.            The basic

equations to be estimated are:

Where UP is the unemployment rate of men between the ages of 35 and 44,

T is the time trend, T67 is a second time trend which begins in 1967, and

i indexes demographic groups.

         Equations like (4) are traditional in analyses of labor forece par-

ticipation.        They have provided the basis for estimates of "hidden unemp10y-

ment"     (Te11a     (1965), Dernberg and Strand (1966),         and estimates of the full

employment potential labor force (Perry (1.977)). The unemployment rate of

middle-aged (ages 35-44) males is used as a measure of aggregate demand.

It is expected to influence the level of participation since the costs of

search are affected by job availability.              Moreover, apart from any changes

in the real wage, the quality of available jobs varies over the cycle.

In order to avoid simultaneity problems we use this variable rather than a

demographically adjusted unemployment rate as a measure of cyclical conditions.

The results using Perry's weighted unemployment rate are very similar

to those presented here~ We include lagged unemployment rates to take

account of recognition and action lags in the response to fluctuations.                      The

estimates of the total impact of unemployment are extremely insensitive to

the form of the lag structure.          The broken time trend beginning in 1967 (T67)

is intended to allow for recent changes in secular trends.                    While the choice

of T67 is somewhat arbitrary, the results reported below are very insensitive

to its omission or to its replacement with trends beginning earlier or

later.     Estimation of (4) and (5) with a quadratic term in time had no
                                     - 7 -


significant effect on the results.

      Equations like (5) have not been extensively used in studying

group unemployment rates.    Feldstein (1973), and Feldstein and Wright (1976)

have estimated similar relations in order to study the potential of

aggregate demand to reduce demographic unemployment rates.    Equati.on (5) can be

justified in much the same way as the participation equation.      Aggregate

demand will have different effects on the unemployment rates of different

groups, because of employers' rules in laying off workers, and because of

quit patterns.   Certain groups are more prone to be laid off, others are

more prone to leave jobs and so their unemployment experience is likely to

respond quite differently to aggregate demand.

          The equations to be estimated are not designed to provide the

best or most detailed explanation of the participation (unemployment) rate

of each group.   Our purpose is to estimate a comnlon model for each group

which captures the response of participation (unemployment) to cyclical fluc-

tuations in aggregate demand.    Thus, some potential explanatory variables,

such as real wages and inflation, have been excluded precisely because of

their cyclical variation.    That is, our equation is intended as a reduced

form for. the individual cyclical effects.    Other variables have been Olnitted

because they are essentially orthogonal to the variables included.     We   have

in work available on request reestimated the equations reported here including

variables reflecting demographic factors, inflationary expectations, and house-

hold wealth and liquidity.   While these variables are sometimes significant,

their inclusion has little impact on the estimated cyclical effects.

          The interpretation of the coefficients in equations (4) and (5)

is quite straightforward.    For example, the cyclical responsiveness of
                                     th
the participation rate of the i           group may be measured by:

                                          n                                      (6)

 A value of y PR = 1.0 indicates that a 1 percentage point incr.ease in :the:

.430 to .434).
       Equations (4) and (5) have been estimated using quarterly data for

the period 1950-1976 for various demographic groups.            The coefficients on

lagged unemployment have been constrained to follow a first order polynomial

constrained at the far end to pass through the origin, with a length of

eight quarters.   The identity (1) ensures that the relationship between the

employment ratio and aggregate demand and time is given by:



           in(EN)it   = Bo + a 0 +
                                                                                 (7)




 It follows immediately that the equations presented here can be used to

 decompose the cyclical movements of the employment ratio into its unemploy-

 ment and participation components since:

                                      =                                          (8)
                                       - 9 -


       . We have estimated equations (4) and (5) using a maximum likelihood

technique to correct for serial correlation.      The change in the employment

ratio arising from movements in the unemployment rate and the rate of parti-

cipation is calculated using the identity (8).5 Its approximate standard

error is found by assuming that there is no covariance between yi        and yi •

The regression equations for vari~us age-se~ groups are reported in the Appendix.

In the next section the estimates of cyclical responsiveness are analyzed.



Section II:    Demographic Demand Sensitivities

               Table 2 presents    estimates of the elasticity of cyclical

response of employment, unemployment and participation for several demo-
       . groups.6 Beneath the estimates in parentheses are the estimated
grap h l.C

standard. errors.     As noted above, the numbers in

column 1, which give the cyclical responsiveness of employment, are the

sum of the estimates of the responsiveness of participation and unemploy-

ment (i.e., the employment rate) found in columns 2 and 3.

            A clear implication of the results for men is that teenagers are

particularly sensitive to cyclical developments.       The estimates imply that

a decline in the prime age male unemployment rate from six to five percent

will produce a 4.5 percent increase in the proportion of male teenagers

employed.     Over 35 percent of this change comes from movements in participation.

Among adult males 25-64, participation is very cyclical, with an elasticity

close to zero.      The employment rate, however, has an elasticity close to

unity, so that on average a 1 point reduction in unemployment of mature

men is associated with a 1 percent increase in the employment of this group.

Among elderly men over 65, the employment rate elasticity is 1.02, close

to that for other adult groups.     However, for this group participation is

almost as responsive as that of teenagers.       The net effect is an employment

ratio elasticity of 2.70, suggesting that older men are among the prime

beneficiaries of an expanding economy.     This no doubt reflects the tendency

of firms to induce early retirements in times of business cycle slack.

          The results for women reveal substantial cyclical sensitivity

among the younger age groups.     As in the case of men, female teenagers are

very sensitive to cyclical developments.       We estimate that a 1 point decline

in the prime age male unemployment rate will lead to a 2.5 percent increase in the

participation rate of very young women.        Combined with a large drop in

unemployment, the employment ratio of this group is consequently increased

by over 4 percent for each percentage point change in the prime age male

unemployment rate.    Similarly large gains in employment are estimated for

women ages 20-24 and 25-34.     In each case the elasticity of emplo)rment

exceeds two, with    much of   the gain coming in increased participation.

Women 16-34 thus display a greater degree of cyclical sensitivity than

their male counterparts.

          Women 35-54 are less responsive to cyclical changes than younger

women, but on average, the employment ratio elasticity is still greater than that

estimated for men.   The negative coefficients on participation for older women

sharply reduces the estimated sensitivity of the group employment ratio to changes

in unemployment, even to the point of producing a negative relationship.       For

example, the participation coefficient for women over 65 is -1.5, a value

which swamps the unemployment effect, leading to an estimate of -.91 for

employment.    It should be noted, however, that these estimates are not statistically

significant.

Demographic Contribution to Cyclical Variation
               The estimates in table 2 give evidence of wide variations in

 cyclical sensitivity across demographic groups.              The relative importance of

 the various age groups in accounting for cyclical movements in aggregate

 employment is examined in Table 3.              In columns 2 and 3 we have used the
                                                                     i

respectively.

               The calculations indicate that in aggregate employment is pro-cyclical.

A 1 percent decline in the prime age male unemployment rate leads to a 1.5

percent increase in employment.               A key result of the calculations is that

young workers account for the larger part of the cyclical variatioHs in                employm~::H:.

While teenagers comprise less than a tenth of the population, they account

for more than a fourth of cyclical fluctuations.              Teenagers and young women

20-34 represent only 25 percent of the adult population, yet they experience

close to 50 percent of the cyclical variation in employment.              Prime age males

25-64 are a large fraction of the population (32.6 percent) but account for

less cycli.ca1 employment variation than teenagers who represent only 9 percent

of the population.

             The analysis presented in Tables 2 and 3 demonstrates the importance

of examining changes in participation in connection with related movements in

employment and unemployment.     The results suggest that teenagers and young women

are particularly sensitive to short run movements in aggregate economic activity.

These patterns are consistent with a significant discouraged worker effect.

However, with negative coefficients among older women, and virtually no

responsiveness among prime age men, the aggregate participation rate displays

relatively little cyclical sensitivity.     While aggregate movements in

employment reflect primarily movements in unemployment, substantial variations

in the composition of the labor force do occur over the business cycle.

Race and Enrollment Status

       Variations in cyclical employment experience may be expected to depend

on factors other than age and sex.     Two such factors, race and school

enrollment are examined in Tables 4 and 5, where the decompositions discussed

above are presented for white and non-white workers, and separately for

enrolled and non-enrolled young people.     The results suggest that these

factors make a considerable difference.      The employment experience of

non-whites is much   ~ore   responsive to cyclical conditions than the experience

of whites.    A 1 percent reduction in the mature male unemployment rate raises

the proportion of non-white youth who are employed by about 7 percent, compared

to a little over 4 percent for white youths.      The employment of older non-whites

is not as responsive to cyclical condition~ but still exhibits substantially more

sensitivity than employment among the white population.      For non-white men over

20, the employment ratio rises by 2.5 percent for each 1 point decline in the prime

age male unemployment rate.     This is almost three times as large as the response

for white men.

       The results in Table 5 display dramatic differences in the labor

market behavior of enrolled and out of school youth.      For young men and

women enrolled in school, almost all of the response of employment

is due to movements in participation rather than unemployment.      The opposite

pattern characterizes youth who are out of school.      Increases in employment

for this group come almost entirely at the expense of unemployment.         However

employment of out of school youth appears to be only about half as sensitive

to demand as that of enrolled young people.

          The reasons for these disparities are not clear.   One possible

explanation is that youth who are in school tend to passively await job

offers.    When offered an attractive job, they accept and join the labor

force.    Otherwise, they remain out of the labor force.     This would explain

the observed pattern of participation and unemployment dynamics.

Section III:     The Role of Aggregate Demand

            The results in Section II indicate that aggregate demand as measured

by the prime age male unemployment rate has a significant effect on the unemploy-

ment and participation rates of most demographic groups.       The effect is

especially pronounced in those groups which traditionally have the highest

unemployment and lowest participation rates.     For example," black teenagers,

whose     unemployment rate averaged over 40 percent during 1976, benefit

most from increased aggregate demand.      Their employment ratio rises

by over 6 percent for each 1 point decline in the prime age male

unemployment rate.    Yet, many observers judge that the problems of high

unemployment demographic groups, such as black teenagers, are largely the

result of structural factors and are quite insensitive to aggregate demand.

Perhaps the most widely cited statement of this view is found in Feldstein

(1973).    In this section we analyze the extent to which aggregate demand can

reduce the unemployment of disadvantaged demographic groups.
                                      - 18 -


           Pessimism with respect to the efficacy of aggregate demand policy is

buttressed by the observation that the unemployment rate of certain disadvan-

taged groups has remained high even during periods when the overall rate was

reduced to quite low levels.    In 1969, for example, the unemployment rate for

male teenagers was 11.4 percent while the unemployment rate of balck teenagers

was over 23 percent.   The analysis in this paper makes it clear that this

may not reflect the impotence of aggregate demand.     It may be that the

participation rate of high unemployment groups expands rapidly during

periods of economic expansion, causing the group unemployment rate to remain

at a fairly high level.   On this view, the apparent sluggishness in unemployment

arises because the hidden unemployment which is not measured during times

when jobs are unavailable, simply becomes measurable.     In order to examine the

role of aggregate demand, we have used the equations described in the preceding

section to estimate the unemployment rate which would have arisen in 1976      ~f


the unemployment rate of men 35-44 had been driven to its 1969 level .(1.3 percent).

         The results confirm the widespread view that unemployment rates

would remain high, even in an expanding economy.     For example, the estimates

indicate that male teenagers would have had an unemployment rate of 11.5

percent at the end of 1976 even if the prime age male unemployment rate had

been driven well below 2 percent.   Likewise, black male teenagers would

have had an unemployment rate of over 23 percent.     Similar patterns hold

for young women.   It is significant that the predicted 1976 rates for male

teenagers (both black and total) are virtually identical to the rates which

actually prevailed in 1969.    This result suggests that the empirical model

provides a relatively consistent characterization of the cyclical experience

of these groups.

           In order to examine the extent to which the resilience of high

unemployment rates reflects surges in participation, we have recalculated

the unemployment rates under the assumption that participation rates remain

constant as aggregate demand expands.     Unemployment rates calculated on this

basis are shown in column 3 of Table 5.    They indicate that with constant

participation, increased aggregate demand could reduce unemployment rates of

most demographic groups to very low levels.7 For example, increased employment

would lead to a male teenage unemployment rate of 5.6 percent, comparable

to the average unemployment rate of the entire population over the       postwar

period.   The unemployment rate of young women would be driven   dow~   to similarly

low levels.   However, the unemployment rate of black teenagers would still        re~ain


at levels approaching 17 percent for young men, and 16 percent for young women.

While clearly indica.tive of an important social problem, these calculations

 indicate that considering participation increases significantly the apparent

 power of cyclical expansion in reducing unemployment.

           It is somewhat difficult to interpret the results.    Were participation

 to remain constant, it is clear that aggregate demand could eliminate serious

 unemployment problems for most demographic groups.    Participation, however, does

 not in fact remain constant.   This would seem, if anything, to strengthen the

 case for expansionary policy, since the large surge in participation which

inevitably accompanies cyclical expansion must indicate a chronic shortage

of jobs, or at least that many persons are outside of the labor force      because

 they expect little gain from further employment search.    Encouraging the re-

entrance of these individuals would seem to be an additional benefit of

expansionary policy.   It is clearly fallacious to argue that the potential

entry of the hidden unemployed renders aggregate demand policy relatively

impotent in easing the labor marketproblemd of specific demographic groups.

             These findings have important implications for recent legislation

designed to move the economy towards full employment.          The Humphrey-Hawkins

bill provides for mandatory unemployment targets both in aggregate and for

demographic groups." Our analysis indicates that unemployment targets are

misguided.     Since unemployment rate movements can reflect either desirable

or undesirable changes it is hardly sensible to design policy with a specific

unemployment rate in mind.     Rather, a much better means of serving the goal

of full employment would be to phrase targets explicitly in terms of

employment.     Such a measure would avoid all of the ambiguities inherent in

a CPS interpretation of the unemployment/nonparticipation distinction, as

well as providing a sounder     foundation for policy.      A potential difficulty

with this appnoach is that changes in labor supply patterns would alter

the appropriate employment targets.     These changes are typically gradual

so that allowing for trends in the employment targets may be feasible.
Conclusions

             The central conclusion of this    papE~   is that understanding the

cyclical dynamics of the labor market requires joint focus on unemployment and

labor force participation.    Both contribute substantially to observed

variation in employment.     Since their relative contributions differ substanially

across demographic groups, both must be considered in making demographic

comparisons. Our results suggest that young people bear a very disproportionate

share of cyclical employment fluctuations.       In large part, this is due to

the cyclical movements in their participation.          It has frequently been observed

that high unemployment rates for some groups persist even in cyclical

expansions.    We show that the resilience of high unemployment is due to
increases in participation, rather than continued laek of         emplo)~ent

opportunities.     This finding suggests that the potential contribution of

macro-economic policy to alleviating the employment problems of specific

demographic groups can be quite large.

1Fe1dstein (1973) has demonstrated the importance of demographic dis-
tinctions in analyzing unemployment. Other analyses, notably Mincer
(1962, 1966) and Bowen and Finnegan (1969) have shown the extent of
differences in participation behavior across demographic groups.

2There are additional reasons for treating the unemployment data with
caution. Clark and Summers (1979) have argued that an important part
of transitions into and out of unemployment arises from inconsistent
reporting of relatively consistent behavior~ They cite evidence on rotation
group bias, the effects on reporting of slight changes in the survey, and
re-interview error rates which shows that a sizeable fraction of the
flows between unemployment and not-in-1abor force is an artifact of the
monthly survey.

3Note that as long as UR < .1, it differs negligibly from 1n (l-UR).
Hence (3) can be interpreted as showing that the percentage change in
employment is equal to the the percentage change in the participation rate
minus the change in the unemployment rate.

4For example, the employment elasticity for women 25-34 using Perry's
weighted unemployment rate in an annual version of the model was 2.03,
compared to 2.44 in the quarterly version with correction for auto
correlation.

5None of the con1cusions are significantly altered when the employment
ratio equation is estimated directly. Of course, the identity (3) is
no longer satisfied.

6In interpreting all the results in this section, it may be useful to
note that a movement of 1 point in the prime-age male unemployment rate
correspond to a change of 1.25 points in the overall rate.

7These predictions may depend on the functional form of the estimating
equation. Feldstein and Wright (1976) found little difference in the
response to changes in unemployment between periods of high and low
unemployment.
