We find that the strategy is surprisingly effective. it stochastically dominates buying and holding shorter-term bills for large subperiods, and nearly dominates for the entire sample period, 1949-1988. Our empirical results suggest that abnormal profit opportunities are available from selectively increasing the maturity of a short-term portfolio.\n\n",
