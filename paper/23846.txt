Premium Levels and Demand Response in Health Insurance: Relative Thinking and Zero-Price
Effects

ABSTRACT
In health care systems with a competitive health insurance market, governments or other sponsors
(e.g. employers) often subsidize premiums to encourage enrolment. These subsidies are typically
independent of plan choice leaving the absolute premium differences in place so as not to distort
consumer choice of plan. Such subsidies do, however, change the relative premium differences
across plans, which, according to theories from behavioral economics, can affect choice.
Consumers might be sensitive to differences relative to a reference premium (“relative thinking”).
Furthermore, consumers might be particularly sensitive to a reference premium of zero (“zeroprice effect”), a relevant range for some subsidized health insurance markets. This paper tests
these ideas with two sources of evidence. We argue that observed equilibria in Germany and the
U.S. Medicare Advantage markets are consistent with a powerful zero-price effect, resulting in an
equilibrium focal pricing at zero. This contrasts with the Netherlands where equilibrium
premiums are well above zero. In an empirical test using hypothetical questions in a web-based
survey in these three countries, we also find evidence for both a relative thinking and a zero-price
effect in the demand for health insurance. Our findings imply that well-designed subsidies can
leverage relative thinking to increase demand elasticity for health plans. Creation of a powerful
reference price (e.g., at zero), however, risks subverting price competition.

1. Introduction
Many countries organize health insurance markets according to the principles of regulated (or
managed) competition in order to provide comprehensive and affordable health insurance to
their population (Van de Ven et al. 2013). 2 Health plans compete on price, service and,
depending on the country, some elements of plan quality, such as extra coverage or the
breadth of the contracted provider network. Premiums are generally regulated (e.g., by
requiring some form of community rating) to subsidize the sick as well as to protect
consumers against reclassification risk. Public subsidies play an important role in managed
competition policies, reducing the consumer-paid portion of premiums to ensure access to
coverage.

Public subsidies in some regulated competition markets shrink the consumer premiums for
health insurance by 50% or more. Indeed, in the world’s two largest markets (in terms of
spending) organized according to regulated competition, the Social Health Insurance system
in Germany (from 2009-2014) and the Medicare Advantage program in the U.S., subsidies set
independent of health plan choice reduce equilibrium premiums charged to consumers to
around zero. Since Enthoven (1988), economists have argued that the subsidy should be
fixed, i.e. independent of plan choice. 3 A fixed subsidy would not, the argument goes,
interfere with consumers’ relative valuation of plans or plans’ incentives to compete on price.
Recent research in behavioural economics questions this argument.

According to conventional price theory, consumer choice of plan depends on the absolute
price differences between the available health plans, irrespective of the price level. If a plan
is 100 euro less expensive than an alternative plan, the consumer should make the same
choice (putting aside income effects) if that difference is between a 10 euro plan and a 110
euro plan, or between a 510 euro plan and a 610 euro plan. In practice, however, a fixed
subsidy may not be neutral in its effect on plan subjective rankings and choices. The
behavioral economics literature finds that consumers may also respond to relative prices
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1981). If 10 euro is a consumer’s reference price point for a health

2

Some examples are Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Examples in the US are the
Marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act and Medicare Advantage.
3
Notice that fixed subsidies may vary per individual but not by plan choice. Most countries and health insurance
markets set up as managed competition involve some form of risk adjustment of the premiums as part of plan
payment. See Van de Ven and Ellis (2000) for general discussion of such systems.

plan 110 euro seems very expensive, whereas if 510 euro is a consumer’s reference point, 610
euro may seem not so much more. 4 In this case, fixed subsidies will not be neutral.
Furthermore, experiments find that a zero price is a particularly powerful reference point
(Shampanier et al., 2007).
Research in health economics tests behavioural hypotheses about health plan choice. 5 Taylor
et al. (2015) reviews research related to the complexity of products offered, limited health
literacy and numeracy of the population, inadequate decision-support tools, and an excessive
number of choices. As far as we know, the first paper to feature a “zero-price” effect in
demand for a health plan was by Buchmueller and Feldstein (1997) who studied health plan
choice among employees of a large employer in the U.S. moving to a fixed subsidy equal to
the cost of the least expensive plan. They found that a zero price had special salience and
acted as a reference price. A less than a 10 dollar increase in monthly premiums from a
previous premium of zero caused roughly a five-fold increase in plan switching. A small-scale
experiment among about 2,000 members of a Dutch internet panel checked for relative
thinking. In return for a uniform premium discount, significantly more respondents were
willing to switch to a less attractive health plan (in terms of provider network, coverage or
claims payment process) at a relatively low than a relatively high premium level (Schut and
Laske-Aldershof, 2001).

This paper adds two forms of evidence supporting reference-price behavior in the context of
subsidized health insurance markets. We use the relative thinking-reference price framework
to interpret equilibria in three important subsidized health insurance markets. We
acknowledge that observing bunching in national patterns of pricing in the market data led us
to seek an explanation, so showing that the national patterns are consistent with our
hypotheses does not constitute an empirical test in a conventional sense. Nonetheless, we find
it instructive to provide a theoretical framework with which to interpret the effect of fixed
subsidies in these large health insurance markets. We propose that relative thinking and
reference prices may affect health plan demand in two ways. First, they may affect the slope
of the demand curve as lower reference prices may increase sensitivity to absolute price
4

Income effects cannot be responsible for lower response to the same absolute differences at higher price levels;
in fact they would work in the opposite direction. At a higher price level, consumers are poorer and should value
a given price difference more, not less.

A large literature in health economics studies the price elasticity of demand for health insurance, for recent
reviews, see McGuire (2012) and Pendzialek et al. (2016).

differences. Second, reference-dependent demand may result in a kinked demand curve and
lead to reference-point pricing in market equilibrium. Observed patterns of pricing are
consistent with both effects in subsidized health insurance markets in Germany, U.S.
Medicare Advantage, and the Netherlands, which differ both in the level and salience
reference premiums. It appears that salient reference prices are powerfully influencing health
plan premium setting and consumer choices, particularly in Germany and Medicare
Advantage where zero reference-point prices play an important role.

Our second form of evidence is a conventional test, using responses to a web-based survey of
approximately 3,600 respondents in the three countries in an experimental environment. We
ask hypothetical questions about prices and health plan choice, and the responses confirm our
hypotheses: absolute price differences matter more when price levels are lower, confirming
the presence of relative thinking, and this effect is somewhat larger at a zero price, consistent
with the presence of a zero-price effect.

Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some of the evidence for
reference price effects in the general literature and introduces the key concepts of reference
dependence, relative thinking and the zero-price effect. Section 2 also discusses the potential
impact on price variation, competition, and consumer utility. Section 3 interprets patterns of
plan pricing and studies of demand response in three of the largest markets organized along
principles of regulated competition: the social health insurance system in Germany, the
national health insurance scheme in the Netherlands, and in the Medicare Advantage sector in
the U.S. Section 4 reports the results of a web-based survey of 1,200 consumers in each of
the three countries. Section 5 returns to the three health plan markets introduced earlier and
considers how reframing of premiums might improve market functioning. Our findings imply
that policymakers have an additional instrument to influence choice behavior by consumers,
and as a result, premium setting by health plans. A sponsor can influence price elasticity of
demand for health plans by how premiums are framed for consumers. This no-budget-cost
regulatory tool may be useful in markets for health plans where greater consumer demand
response to price is needed to effectively discipline insurer pricing.

2. Relative Thinking and a Zero-Price Effect

2.1. Relative thinking and zero-price effect: empirical evidence
Consumers may behave differently according to how prices are framed (Thaler 1980).
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) were among the first to introduce relative thinking into the
literature on biases in economic decision-making. They showed that consumers are affected
by relative price differences when only absolute prices should matter. In a well-known
example, Tversky and Kahneman (1981) find that 68% of the respondents in an experiment
were willing to make a trip to another store (located 20 minutes away) to save $5 on a $15
calculator, but only 29% were willing to make the trip for the same $5 savings when the
calculator's price was $125.

The theoretical foundations of relative thinking can be traced to the Weber–Fechner law,
which states that people respond to changes in physical stimuli by comparing it to an original
value (Thaler 1980, Saini and Thota 2010). Furthermore, empirical results on consumer
choice support the generalizations that consumers use reference prices in making brand
choices and rely on past prices as part of the reference price formation process (Kalyanaram
and Winer, 1995).

Grewal and Marmorstein (1994) propose that the psychological utility consumers derive from
saving a certain amount is inversely related to the good's original price. Bartels (2006) shows
that people may even maximize relative savings at the expense of absolute savings. Saini and
Thota (2010) find that relative thinking plays a more important role in decision making if the
cognitive load for consumers is higher, if the purchase involves affect-rich (emotions-based)
products, and if consumers have a stronger individual level preference for intuitive decisionmaking. Azar (2011a; 2011b) also finds that both relative and absolute differences matter and
the proportion of relative versus absolute thinking depends upon the specific circumstance.
Several other studies have replicated these findings in various experimental settings (for a
brief review, see Azar (2014)). Soltani et al. (2012) argue that context-dependent choice
behavior could be a natural consequence of the biophysical limits of neural representation in
the brain.

5

Relative thinking appears to be particularly powerful when the reference point is a “zero
price” (see Shampanier et al. (2007) for review). In a series of experiments Shampanier et al.
(2007) show that a price reduction from a small positive price to a zero price boosts demand
for the free product. They argue that a zero price conveys some benefit in itself; a move away
from zero to a positive price may not only result in a loss of utility because of the absolute
price increase but also in a loss of utility because of having to give up a free product. The
“zero-price” effect is observed in other contexts. Nicolau and Sellers (2011) study choice of
breakfasts when a preferred option is priced higher than a less-preferred alternative. When
absolute differences are the same but the cheaper option is free, demand for it increases.
Hossain and Saini (2015) replicate methods of Shampanier et al. (2007) and find the “zeroprice bounce” is enhanced for hedonic products (for fun and feelings) and subdued for
utilitarian products (for functional benefits). 6

The zero-price effect could be thought of simply as an extension of relative thinking – the
ratio of any positive price to zero is infinity. Given the special interest in a zero price for
health insurance, we will continue to refer to and later test for a zero-price effect within the
broader framework of relative thinking.

2.2. Loss aversion, kinked demand and focal pricing
Another robust finding in behavioral economics, first proposed and documented by
Kahneman and Tversky (1984), is loss aversion, i.e. the asymmetry in reaction to payoffs
above versus below a focal or reference payoff level (see also Kőszegi and Rabin 2006, Terzi
et al. 2016). Heidhues and Kőszegi (2008) show that reference pricing can explain focal and
uniform pricing as the unique outcome even when firms face different cost structures.
Because consumers may be especially averse to paying a price exceeding their reference
price, the price responsiveness of demand is greater for prices above the reference price than
for prices below. Raising prices above the reference price is unattractive to firms because
many consumers leave, whereas reducing prices below the reference price may not gain many
customers. Hence, in an echo of the old theory explaining “sticky prices” in oligopoly, firms
may face a demand curve kinked at the reference price. 7

6

We expect health insurance to be in the latter category.
The reference-dependence reason for a kinked demand is different than that in traditional models of kinked
demand facing an olipopolist (Sweezy 1939), where the kink results from each firm believing that rivals will
follow price decreases but not price increases.

2.3. Health plan choice in case of relative thinking and fixed premium subsidies
According to conventional theory, consumer choice between Plan A and B is governed by the
net benefits of each option.The consumer chooses Plan A if and only if (1) holds :
𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴 − 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵 > 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴 − 𝑃𝑃𝐵𝐵 ,

(1)

where 𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴,𝐵𝐵 represents the benefits (utility) and 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴,𝐵𝐵 the premiums of Plans A and B,

respectively. A fixed subsidy (S) to premiums 𝑃𝑃 reduces both 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴 and 𝑃𝑃𝐵𝐵 by S and therefore
has no effect on their difference or on consumer choice. Kahneman and Tversky (1979)

introduced the idea of diminishing sensitivity; people are less sensitive to changes the further
those changes are away from a reference point. Recently, other types of “relative thinking”
models were developed concerning the role of salience in decision making (for example Azar
2007, Bushong et al. 2015, Cunningham 2013, and Koszegi and Szeidl 2013). We introduce
here a specific form of relative thinking as described by Azar (2007) where people are less
sensitive to price changes at higher reference price levels. Following Azar, we modify
equation (1) by including the reference premium as an approximation of the price level:

8

1 𝛼𝛼

𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴 − 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵 > (𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴 − 𝑃𝑃𝐵𝐵 ) �𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅� .

(2)

Here RP is the consumer’s reference premium, and α denotes the degree of relative thinking
(0 ≤ α ≤ 1). If 𝛼𝛼 = 0, there is no relative thinking and we obtain equation (1), whereas if 𝛼𝛼 =

1, choice between A and B depends only on premiums relative to a reference premium. With

relative thinking, the impact of premium differences is inversely related to the level of RP: for
instance, if the premium of plan A is 50 dollars higher than that of plan B this may matter a
lot if the consumer has an RP of 100 dollars in mind, whereas it may not matter much in case
of an RP of 1000 dollars.
A fixed subsidy S influences relative thinking. A fixed premium subsidy S has no effect on
the difference between PA and PB, but may affect the reference premium RP and thereby alter
choices. For instance, suppose with 𝛼𝛼 = 1, the introduction of a premium subsidy results in a

new reference price RP1 = RP – S. If PA > PB, the relative premium difference between both
plans becomes more pronounced because (PA – PB)/RP1> (PA – PB)/RP (assuming S < RP).
8

Alternatively, an additive model can be formulated, see Azar (2014).

7

Thus, in contrast to conventional theory a fixed premium subsidy may affect consumer
choice. Notice that the effect is non-linear and becomes stronger for subsidies S approaching
RP. In the model the effect is infinite when RP1 =0, i.e. representing an extreme zero-price
effect. 9

2.4. Reference price formation
How references prices are determined is obviously consequential since the implications of
relative thinking and reference dependence differ depending on the specification of the
reference point (Kőszegi and Rabin 2007). Reference point formation appears to depend on
the circumstances, such as the prices a buyer has faced in the past (Kalyanaram and Winer
1995, Kőszegi and Rabin 2006). Experimental research shows that consumers use different
reference prices, some consumers employ multiple reference prices, while others employ
none (Terzi et al. 2016).

In health insurance markets reference price formation may also be influenced by the
government (or other sponsor) by the way premiums are framed or by the level of the subsidy.
For example, the government might announce an expected premium level. Clearly, reference
dependence will have more power to affect market equilibrium if more consumers in a market
share the same reference price.

2.5. Reference premiums and health plan mark-ups
Demand response checks a seller’s ability to mark up price above costs. The potential impact
of reference dependence on markups depends on the level of the reference premium in
relation to the equilibrium premium and the strength of the relative thinking. This is
illustrated by Figures 1 and 2 where we show the situation of a representative health plan with
some market power. 10 In both figures, D0 represents health plan demand in absence of relative
thinking, in which case health plans charge the profit-maximizing premium P0. In case of
relative thinking and a clear-cut reference premium (RP) functioning as a focal price,
reference dependence results in a kinked demand curve D1. In this case a profit maximizing
health plan would set its premium equal to the reference premium because at lower premiums

Adding a positive constant to RP in the denominator would result in a finite zero-price effect.
We assume health plan competition between an equal number of symmetric profit maximizing health plans
and a fixed total population for which insurance is mandatory and the benefits package is standardized. Hence, in
equilibrium, health plan enrollment is equal for all health plans.

its marginal revenue would drop below its marginal cost. The concept of loss aversion (see
for example Heidhues and Kőszegi, 2008) implies that at prices exceeding the reference
premium the demand curve D1 is more elastic than demand curve D0, whereas D1 is less
elastic than D0 at prices below the reference premium. The effect of relative thinking crucially
depends on the level of the reference premium. If the reference premium is set below P0, as
illustrated in Figure 1, relative thinking results in a lower mark-up, whereas the opposite
situation is illustrated in Figure 2. Hence, relative thinking can be a double-edged sword. In
the presence of imperfect competition, it might decrease markups if fixed premium subsidies
result in focal premiums that are close to marginal costs, but might increase markups if it
results in focal prices that substantially exceed marginal costs.

3. Evidence of reference dependence and focal pricing in three health insurance markets

In this section we investigate the evidence for reference dependence and focal pricing in three
health insurance markets. In each setting, fixed premium subsidies stipulated in government
regulations have a large impact on equilibrium premiums and possibly consumer reference
premiums. In two of these settings, the German Social Health Insurance system (from 20092014) and Medicare Advantage in the US, fixed premium subsidies are large enough to drive
market prices to near or even below zero. 11 Hence, these settings offer an opportunity to
check for a zero-price effect and its impact on health plan pricing. The German health
insurance setting is particularly interesting because the premium structure (including the level
of fixed premium subsidies) changed markedly twice over our period of review, shifting
potential reference premium levels. The Dutch universal health insurance scheme serves as a
useful contrast. In the Netherlands, risk-adjusted premium subsidies (per individual) equal
the predicted expenses (per individual) minus 50 percent of the average predicted expenses.
This implies that Dutch health insurers have to cover about 50 percent of the average
predicted expenses by charging community-rated premiums to their enrollees, resulting in
much higher equilibrium health plan premiums paid by consumers than in the US and
German settings. Table A.1 in Appendix A summarizes some of the main features of the
three health insurance markets.

11

We later describe the rebate mechanisms in Germany and Medicare Advantage. Consumers can only buy a
quantity of one health plan and cannot resell the product, so retradability that would eliminate negative prices in
many markets does not operate in the case of health insurance.

10

In each of the three markets the government acting as a sponsor contributes or stipulates a
risk-adjusted subsidy to competing health plans. These premium subsidies are risk-adjusted
and in the case of Germany and the Netherlands fixed per enrolee so as to be independent of
an enrolee’s health plan choice. Medicare Advantage involves a bidding system that partially
links the subsidy to plan’s premium as we describe below. Health plans compete in a market
and choose the level of premiums they charge to enrolees. The general structure of health
plan financing in the three markets is depicted in Figure 3. 12
Figure 3. Two Sources of Financing for Health Plans

In all three markets, premiums are community-rated, meaning plans must charge the same
premium to all enrolees. After a brief description of the premium structure in each country
we consider two kinds of evidence bearing on relative thinking and a zero-price effect.
Relative thinking implies that demand response to absolute premium differences depends
inversely on the level of equilibrium premiums. Zero-price effects imply equilibria in this
range will exhibit particularly strong focal point pricing.

3.1. The German Social Health Insurance system
The German Social Health Insurance (SHI) system, in place in roughly its current form since
1996 when switching health plans became a legal right, covers about 85 percent of the

12

For a review of health plan financing in these three sectors as well as 11 other sectors and countries see
McGuire and Van Kleef (eds) (2018). Notice that this general structure of health plan financing also applies to
other health insurance settings, such as the Swiss health insurance scheme, US employer-based health insurance
(where employers are the sponsor), and the health insurance marketsplaces of the US Affordable Care Act
(ACA).

11

German population (Busse and Blümel, 2014). 13 During this period, however, the premium
structure was profoundly changed twice, impacting premium variation and health plan choice.

We discuss the changes in premium structure for three consecutive time periods before and
after the two reforms, and illustrate the impact of the reforms by three figures showing the
premium distribution among German health plans in each period. The vertical axis will show
the same 0-100 range in order to highlight the contrast in the distributions over time. Two
previous papers have discussed the 2009 reform. Schmitz and Ziebarth (2017) and Pendzialek
(2015) show that framing of prices is important and both find that consumer price sensitivity
significantly increased after the reform when premium differentials between plans became
more salient. We add a graphical analysis to their findings and also study the 2015 reform.
Income-related individual health plan premiums (1996-2008)
Until 2009 German health plans (known as sickness funds) were free to set an income-related
contribution rate for covering all health and administrative expenses. 14 Health plans with a
relatively high-risk population were compensated by health plans with a relatively low-risk
population through a system of mandatory risk-adjusted subsidies across health plans. 15
Despite the largely standardized benefits package, contribution rates varied widely, from 12.2
to 16.7 percent of gross income (see Figure 4). 16 Despite the substantial variation in
contribution rates, switching rates were modest (Tamm et al. 2007; Schmitz and Ziebarth
2017). As shown in Figure 4, in 2008 there was no specific contribution rate that may have
functioned as an obvious shared reference point.

13

In the German social health insurance scheme family dependents, such as non-working spouses and children,
do not have to pay a contribution. Family dependants cannot switch independently but have to follow their
paying family member .
14
Contribution rates were set by health plans as a percentage of gross income, up to a certain income threshold
(43,200 euro in 2008). The first 0.9 percent of income had to be paid by the employee. The remaining
contribution rate was split 50/50 between the employee and their employer.
15
Notice that the general structure of health plan financing, as depicted in Figure 3, does not fit the German
system prior to 2009. Income-related contributions were directly paid to health plans, and redistributed among
health plans in the form of risk-adjusted (and partly income-adjusted) subsidies. Furthermore, people did not pay
a community-rated premium in addition to the income-related contribution.
16
Premium variation across health plans is quite similar to premium variation in terms of enrollment. The
(unweighted) average contribution rate was 14.3 percent and the (unweighted) standard deviation 1.0 percent.
For people with a minimum income (12,000 euro per year) the variation in contribution rates implied that
premiums could vary by 270 euro per year, whereas for people with an income of 43,200 euro or higher
premium could vary by almost 1,000 euro a year.

Focal pricing at zero premiums (2009-2014)
In 2009 the German premium structure was radically reformed to make premium differences
between health plans more transparent and to enhance competition. The income-related
contributions were no longer set by the individual health plans, but set at a uniform rate by the
government, centrally collected in a Health Fund and then redistributed among health plans in
the form of risk-adjusted capitation payments. The level of the risk-adjusted premium
subsidies was set so as to cover 100 percent of insurers’ expected costs on average (Deutsche
Bundesbank 2014). Health plans were allowed to charge so-called “add-on” community-rated
premiums. Furthermore, health plans were also allowed to offer a rebate or negative add-on
premium (also community-rated). Given that on average all of health plans’ expected costs
were covered by the premium subsidies, the expected average add-on premium was around
zero, but of course needn’t be exactly zero for all plans. In 2009 and subsequent years,
however, the vast majority (> 80%) of the health plans charged exactly zero premiums (see
Figure 5). Hence, after the introduction of the new premium structure in 2009 the previously
substantial premium variation across health plans almost completely vanished. 17
17

In addition to the introduction of the new premium structure, the risk adjustment scheme was extended to
include direct measures of morbidity and a complete compensation of income differences. These changes may
have contributed to the strong reduction of the premium variation in 2009.

and www.der-zusatzbeitrag.de

For some health plans, however, a zero premium did not cover costs, and about 10 percent of
all health plans started charging small positive premiums (mostly 8 euro per month) in
2010. 18 In spite of the fact that the resulting premium differences were much smaller than
prior to 2009, the plans charging the small positive premiums experienced a huge outflow of
enrollees (up to 40%), and in 2011 two of these health plans went bankrupt (Pendzialek et al.
2015). Comparing the demand response to premium differences before and after the 2009
reform showed a threefold increase in switching probabilities, while the demand elasticity
quadrupled to about ̶ 4 (Pendzialek et al. 2015, Schmitz and Ziebarth 2017). Apparently,
consumers became much more price sensitive in the range of premiums near zero, consistent
with a powerful zero-price effect. Furthermore, before 2009 many health plans charged
substantially lower contribution rates than the uniform rate set by the government in 2009. 19

18

According to the Deutsche Bundesbank (2014) the pressure on health plans to avoid positive premiums
encouraged them to identify and realise cost-efficiency gains (including achieving scale effects through
mergers).
19
In 2008, about 75 percent of the health plans charged lower contribution rates than 14.9 percent (i.e. the
uniform rate set by the government in 2009), and about 40 percent charges contribution rates lower than 14.0
percent (see: http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/tabelle-so-koennten-sich-die-beitraege-der-krankenkassenveraendern-a-527166.html).

Although these plans could have charged negative add-on premiums (i.e. offer rebates), very
few did. 20 Hence, German health plans can be regarded as facing a kinked demand curve at a
zero premium: very elastic above zero, and very inelastic below zero.

To prevent more health insurer bankruptcies, in 2011, the German government substantially
raised the premium subsidies to health insurers by raising the income-related contribution rate
from 14.9 to 15.5 percent. These higher premium subsidies turned out to be more than enough
to cover costs, and rather than reducing premiums below zero health insurers accumulated
substantial financial reserves (Deutsche Bundesbank 2014). As a result, in 2013, no German
health plan charged a positive premium, and the proportion of health plans offering rebates
(negative premiums) increased to 18 percent (see Figure 5). In view of the accumulation of
financial reserves, however, the proportion of insurers offering rebates was small and the
rebates were modest (varying between 30 and 125 euros per year).
Income-related add-on premiums (2015-present)
In 2015, the German government again reformed the premium structure. First, the German
government lowered the income-related contributions (from 15.5 to 14.6%) resulting in
proportionally lower fixed premium subsidies. Second, flat-rate add-on premiums were
replaced by income-related add-on premiums. Hence, a zero premium in 2014 would be
equivalent to an 0.9 income-related premium in 2015. 21 Each year the German Ministry of
Health calculates and announces the average level of the add-on premium that should be
sufficient to cover the expenses of an average health plan. Health plans are allowed to charge
higher or lower add-on premiums. However, health plans charging a higher premium than the
average level announced by the government, are legally required to notify their enrollees
about this and to inform them about the opportunity to switch to a cheaper health plan. 22
Hence, the premium level announced by the government may now serve as the natural
reference or focal price.
20

Health plans charging a negative add-on premium were typically very small. For instance, in 2011 6.9 percent
of all health plans charged a negative premium, but their joint market share in terms of enrollment was only 0.7
percent. (Calculations based on data obtained from:
http://www.krankenkasseninfo.de/krankenkassen/geschaeftsberichte/).
21
The reduction of the uniform income-related contribution rate by 0.9 percentage points was deducted from the
employee share in the contribution rate.
22
Section 175(4) Socialgesetzbuch V. In addition, since 2015 health plans that raise their contribution rates also
have to inform their enrolees about their right to switch to another health plan. Moreover, they have to inform
their enrolees about the average premium as announced by the government and have to provide an overview of
the premiums of all other available health plans (see: https://www.gesundheitsstadt-berlin.de/durchschnittlicherzusatzbeitrag-2015-bei-09-prozent-festgelegt-4847/).

with open enrollment), obtained from www.1a.net, www.krankenkassen.de, and www.der-zusatzbeitrag.de

As shown in Figure 6, in 2015 most health plans indeed charged a contribution rate of 0.9
percent. Nevertheless, the bunching of health plans at this premium was substantially less
than at the zero premium in 2014 (45 vs 85 percent of all health plans). Interestingly, the
proportion of health plans charging less than the reference price is much higher in 2015 than
in 2014 (i.e. 49 vs 14 percent), indicating that health insurers in 2014 indeed were reluctant to
offer rebates. In 2016 price dispersion further increased and the bunching of health plans at
the “average” premium level as designated by the government (1.1 percent contribution
rate) 23 further reduced to 28 percent, suggesting that the announced premium level is
becoming less widely perceived as a reference price.

In sum, by comparing the different ways premiums were structured over time we show that
the way the German government structured premium subsidies may have had a profound
impact on health plan price competition. Interpreting these impacts within our framework of
relative thinking, two regulatory decisions were especially notable. First, setting premium
subsidies leading to equilibrium prices around zero led to a powerful zero-price effect.

Second, requiring notifications to consumers if a health plan intends to deviate from the
national norm created a reference premium.

3.2. Medicare Advantage (US)
Medicare Advantage (MA), an alternative to traditional Medicare (TM) for elderly and some
disabled in the U.S., enrolls about 17 million beneficiaries, one-third of all beneficiaries.
Medicare pays MA plans a risk-adjusted capitation payment for each enrollee normed on the
average costs in Traditional Medicare (TM) from the enrollee’s county. The formula
determining the payment involves, in addition to risk adjustment, factors related to
geography, adjustments for higher coding of severity in MA compared to TM, quality scores,
and bids through which plans are supposed to declare the estimate of their costs for standard
Medicare benefits for an average Medicare beneficiary (McGuire and Newhouse, 2018). The
upshot of this set of regulations is that Medicare’s payments to MA plans is roughly the
average of costs in TM. MedPAC (2016, 329) estimates that for 2015 the average payment
(including about 4% for quality bonuses) was 102% of TM average costs.

A subsidy equal to costs in TM is sufficient to finance a negative premium for most plans,
since MA plans are, on average able to provide the same benefits as TM at lower cost
(Newhouse and McGuire, 2014). When the Medicare subsidy exceeds the MA plan’s bid,
which is supposed to be a declaration of its costs, the plan must either increase benefits to
beneficiaries (by, for example, reducing the demand-side cost sharing from that in TM) or
reduce the premium charged to beneficiaries.

Medicare beneficiaries pay a premium to Medicare independent of their plan choice, referred
to as the Part B premium. 24 For the large majority of beneficiaries who receive social security
income payments, the Part B premium is deducted automatically from their monthly social
security check. If they choose an MA plan, the beneficiary may also pay a premium to the
plan, which could be positive, negative or zero. A positive monthly premium must be paid by
check or charging a credit card,and is “seen” by the beneficiary in the same way as prices for
other goods and services. A negative premium takes the form of the MA plan paying part of
the Part B premium to Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary, typically, reducing the social
24

The Part B premium is technically voluntary. Medicare beneficiaries are not required to enroll in Part B
(covering physician and some other services) but the vast majority do enroll. The Part B premium only covers
25% or less of the Part B costs so it is a good value for most beneficiaires. Part A of Medicare (mostly hospital
care) is automatic and free to the beneficiary.

17

security payment the beneficiary receives. In our terms, this framing reinforces a “zero-price”
effect in MA. The salience of negative premiums referenced against this zero price may be
lower than for positive premiums (Newhouse and McGuire, 2014).

When the Medicare subsidy exceeds their cost for providing standardized benefits, MA plans
may also increase benefits in addition to reducing the premium below zero, and many plans
do (Stockley et al., 2014). The lower salience of premium reductions below zero means that
plans may stop passing on subsidies to consumers when they hit a zero premium, but continue
to pass on some subsidies through benefit increases. The unequal salience may therefore
distort the form of subsidy pass-through, tilting it towards enhanced benefits and away from a
lower premium. Newhouse and McGuire (2014) find that in 2010 almost half of all
beneficiaries were enrolled in plans that charge a zero premium, and very few were enrolled
in plans that charge a negative premium. The pattern persisted for 2016 (Glazer and
McGuire, 2017). Figure 7 shows bunching at zero for MA premium data for 2016.

A zero premium appears to act as a reference price in the MA plan market. Nothing in the
underlying fundamentals of benefits and costs imply so many plans price exactly at zero if
price should equal average cost. 25 A form of loss aversion may be playing a role. If relative to
a zero premium people are more sensitive to losses (i.e. positive premiums) than to gains (i.e.
negative premiums) demand will be less elastic for prices below zero than above zero.

3.3. The Dutch health insurance system
The Dutch health insurance scheme shares some features with MA in the US and SHI in
Germany (Van de Ven and Schut 2008). However, an important difference is that premium
subsidies to health insurers are much lower than in either of those systems. Risk-adjusted
premium subsidies (per individual) equal the predicted expenses (per individual) minus 50
percent of the average predicted expenses. Health insurers must charge consumers a
community-rated premium to cover the balance of costs (about 100 euro per month).

Figure 8 shows that in 2016 health plan premiums vary between 86 and 114 euro per month
per person. 26 For purposes of comparison, we used the same scale on the vertical axis as in
the US and German figures. In contrast to Germany and US Medicare Advantage there is no
noticeable spike in the premium distribution among Dutch health plans. Only a slightly higher
percentage of the health plans (10%) charge a monthly premium of 99 euro, which is about
the average premium in the market.

There are several possible reasons for the absence of bunching in the Netherlands. First of all,
the Dutch government does not – as in Germany – announce a specific premium level
expected to be sufficient for the average health plan. Furthermore, no regulations require a
health plan to notify its enrollees about the opportunities to switch to another health plan if its
premium (increase) exceeds a certain level. Third, the framing conditions may also be
stronger in Germany as consumer choices are framed as “contribution rates” and are more
discrete expressed in percentage terms. The absence of a clear reference price set by the
government suggests that many consumers use different reference prices (for example last
years’ premium). This is corroborated by the strong price dispersion.
25

There is a second reason for a kink in the demand at a zero price in the case of MA. If a plan bids above the
benchmark, the plan must pass on the full difference in the form of a positive premium. When the bid is below
the benchmark, any savings must be shared with Medicare rather than fully passed on to consumers. See Glazer
and McGuire (2016) for discussion.
26
In 2016 the unweighted average premium and the standard deviation were 100 and 8.5 euro per month,
respectively.

19

The lower premium subsidy in the Netherlands, compared to Germany and MA, results in
higher premium levels, so the expected impact of relative thinking on the slope of the demand
curve may be lower than in the other two settings. Thus, according to our model in section 2,
relative thinking may result in a lower price sensitivity in the Netherlands. Although
consumer health plan price sensitivity is difficult to compare across health systems, the
available evidence indeed suggests that the price sensitivity in the Netherlands is lower than
in Germany (Pendzialek et al. 2016).

4. Testing for a “relative thinking” and a “zero-price” effect
The literature on behavioural economics and our interpretation of pricing in the three health
insurance markets implies that consumer demand response to a lower-priced alternative (e.g,
health plan) may not only depend on absolute price differences (null hypothesis) but also on
prices relative to a reference price (alternative hypothesis). We tested a “relative thinking”
and a “zero-price” effect by surveying respondents from the US, Germany and the
Netherlands, confronting randomly assigned groups of respondents with the same health plan
choices and the same absolute price differences but at different reference premium levels.
4.1. Survey design
The surveys were openly posted on the website of Clickworker (www.clickworker.com), an
internet-based crowd-sourcing company, with a description stating that the survey takes
approximately 5 to 10 minutes to fill out. The survey was posted in Germany, the Netherlands
and the US. Respondents were paid a small amount of money to complete the survey in their
own language. 27 The response limit was set at 1,200 respondents in each country.
Respondents were randomly assigned to a questionnaire with one of the four monthly
reference premiums of 0, 50, 100 or 200 dollars (US respondents) or euros (Dutch and
German respondents).

We took several steps to increase the validity of our results. First, respondents could answer
only one survey. Second, only respondents with completion rates of more than 90 percent at
clickworker.com in the past were eligible. Third, to exclude “robots,” surveys were created
with the commercial program Survio (www.survio.com). Survio requires respondents to reach
the surveys through a link.

The survey contained 12 questions of which the first 10 were about background
characteristics of the respondents. 28 These background characteristics allow us to control for
potential confounders and to test for differences among respondents across different premium
categories. The background section contains questions about age, employment status,

27

Each respondent received 25 cents for a survey that takes about 5 to 10 minutes to fill in.
In our survey two other questions were placed in between the last two questions to prevent easy repetition of
the answers. Appendix C contains the ten background questions and the two relative thinking questions of the
American, German and Dutch surveys that we use for this paper.

28

21

household income and health status. Four questions were related to respondents’ own
experience with health plan choice. We asked respondents whether they were satisfied with
their own health plan, had switched from health insurer in the past five years, perceived
changing from health insurer as difficult and whether they had a reference premium in mind
(and, if so, which premium) when choosing a health plan.

Two questions tested for relative thinking and zero price effect. Specifically we asked the four
randomly assigned groups of respondents in each country whether they were willing to switch
from health plan if: (1) their own health insurer would raise its monthly out-of-pocket
premium by 10 dollars/euros, and (2) a competing health insurer would lower its monthly outof-pocket premium relative to that of their own insurer by 10 dollars/euros.
4.2 Empirical Analysis
For both survey questions we estimated three probit models. The underlying latent variable of
the probit model is 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ = 𝑈𝑈(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 1) − 𝑈𝑈(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 0) where

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ > 0 ∶ person 𝑖𝑖 somewhat or very likely switches to lower priced plan (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 1).

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ < 0 ∶ person 𝑖𝑖 somewhat or very likely remains at the higher priced plan (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 0).
The four reference premiums are represented by 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 , 𝑗𝑗 = 1, . . ,4 (𝑃𝑃1 = 0, 𝑃𝑃2 = 50, 𝑃𝑃3 =

100, 𝑃𝑃4 = 200). We include four dummy variables: 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1, if respondent 𝑖𝑖 faces a reference

premium 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 , and zero otherwise. Moreover, we include a set of 𝑋𝑋 variables with background

information on the respondents. These include dummy variables for different countries, age,
gender, health status, household income, employment status, education, perceived difficulty
of switching health plans, whether persons have switched in the last five years and whether
respondents have a reference premium in mind.
Presence of relative thinking
Relative thinking may be present if respondents switch more often to a 10 euro/dollar lowerpriced plan if the monthly reference premium is lower. Therefore, we estimate for each of the
four dummy variables 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 a separate response parameter 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 in:
Model 1

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ = ∑4𝑗𝑗=1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 + 𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 ,
22

where the 𝛽𝛽 is a vector of effects of the background variables and a constant term in 𝑋𝑋, and 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖

represents the error term. After computing the marginal effects 𝛼𝛼�𝑗𝑗 of the probit model, where

the highest reference premium (𝑃𝑃4 = 200) services as a reference category (so 𝛼𝛼4 = 0), we test
𝐻𝐻0 : 𝛼𝛼�1 = 𝛼𝛼�2 = 𝛼𝛼�3 = 𝛼𝛼4 = 0, i.e., there is no relative thinking, against the alternative

hypothesis

𝐻𝐻1 : Relative thinking if 𝛼𝛼�1 > 𝛼𝛼�2 > 𝛼𝛼�3 > 0.

Presence of a zero price effect

We argue that a zero-price effect may be present if the switching responses at a zero reference
premium are stronger than at the other three reference premiums. The simple model in
equation (2) predicts a non-linear response with stronger responses near zero. We test for the
possibility of a non-linear response by hypothesizing that consumer switching responses are
linearly related to the reference premiums, therefore we introduce an explanatory
variable 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 = ∑4𝑗𝑗=1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 /50. 29 Next, we test whether respondents with a zero reference

premium deviate from this linear relationship, implying that we cannot reject the presence of
a zero price effect:

Model 2

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∗ = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃1 + 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖1 𝜃𝜃2 + 𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 ,

After computing the marginal effects 𝜃𝜃�1 , 𝜃𝜃�2 of Model 2 we test for a zero price effect:
𝐻𝐻2 : We cannot reject the presence of a zero price effect if 𝜃𝜃�2 > 0 (and 𝜃𝜃�1 ≤ 0).

29

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is a categorical variable that contains for each respondent a number 0, 1, 2, or 4, corresponding to their
monthly reference premiums in the survey of respectively, 0, 50, 100 and 200 euro/dollar.

4.3. Data
In total 3580 respondents completed the surveys: 1175 were Dutch, 1196 were German and
1209 were from the US. See Table 2. Among all respondents, 895 (25.0%) respondents were
assigned to a zero reference premium, 866 (24.2%) to a reference premium of 50, 906
(25.3%) to a reference premium of 100, and 909 (25.5%) to a reference premium of 200
euro/dollar. 30 Table 2 provides sample characteristics of our survey and confirms the success
of randomization in terms of the balance of observable characteristics. Across the three
countries, the respondents were relatively homogenous, with some exceptions. The majority
of the respondents were less than 40 years old. There were somewhat more females than
males and the majority of the respondents have a good or excellent health status and a college
or university degree. 31 The majority of the respondents were satisfied with their current health
insurer in all three countries, though the level of satisfaction was somewhat lower in the US.
About half of the respondents reported it to be difficult or somewhat difficult to change
insurers. German respondents show a thirty percent higher switching rate in the past five
years than the Dutch and US respondents which might be related to the recent German
reforms. Interestingly, about 65% of the respondents report having a premium “in mind,”
possibly a reference premium, when deciding to switch to another health plan. The majority
of these respondents use the premium of their current insurer while a minority uses other
information. About 35% of the respondents report not using reference premiums when
choosing a health plan.
4.4. Results
Presence of a “relative thinking” effect
The first question tested respondents’ willingness to switch health plans if their present health
plan raises its premium by 10 dollars/euros per month. In total 2194 of all 3580 respondents
stated they were willing to switch from health plan. Figure 9 summarizes the main results. We
observe a clear pattern in all three countries: respondents were more likely to switch from a
health plan at lower reference premium levels. Table 3 (first column) presents the marginal
30
There were no missings as all respondents completed the survey. We asked clickworker.com to survey exactly
300 respondents for each reference premium in each country, but the Dutch and German survey were closed
somewhat too early, whereas the American survey was kept open somewhat too long. Therefore the number of
respondents differs slightly across categories.
31
The average age of the population in our experiment is similar to Kuziemko et al. (2015) who performed a
web survey experiment with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Other characteristics are similar as well, for
example we have also fewer males and a low number of unemployed persons. However, we have considerably
more persons with a college or university degree. Kuziemko et al. compare the population of their survey with
the population of more traditional American surveys.

reference category. We find evidence for relative thinking: 𝛼𝛼�1 = 13.6% > 𝛼𝛼�2 = 8.6% >

𝛼𝛼�3 = 4.2% > 𝛼𝛼4 = 0, where 𝛼𝛼4 represents the reference category for a reference premium of

200 dollars.

*

The numbers in the columns represent the percentage of respondents that answered (very) likely to
switch to another health plan. One minus this number represents the percentage of respondents who
answered (very) unlikely. Each color represents a reference premium, blue, 0; red 50; grey, 100, and
yellow 200 dollar/euro. TOTAL represent the sum of all US, German and Dutch (NL) respondents.

Respondents stated they are significantly more likely to switch if the reference premium is
lower. 32 For example, an additional 13.6% respondents (or 20% of all respondents intending
to switch) intend to switch if their current monthly reference premium is 0 instead of 200
euros. This figure is of considerable magnitude implying that the relative thinking effect may
be economically relevant. 33 The results in Table 3 also imply that income plays a relatively
minor role. Interestingly, respondents stating that they had a reference premium in mind when
choosing health plans were significantly more willing to switch than those who did not. 34 The
results further indicate that respondents in the US stated they are overall somewhat more
likely to switch. Other significant findings are in line with the health plan choice literature:
32

All three one-sided parameter tests 𝐻𝐻1 : 𝛼𝛼�1 > 𝛼𝛼�2 ; 𝛼𝛼�2 > 𝛼𝛼�3 ; 𝛼𝛼�3 > 0 are not rejected at a 5% level.
We test stated behaviour. Actual responses are likely to be smaller because of transaction costs and other
factors affecting inertia.
34
The marginal effect is 7.6%. This interpretation seems plausible because correlations among the various
background variables are low (see Appendix B. Table B1 for the correlation matrix).

switching propensities are higher for those who are young, healthy and higher educated. 35
Other results were also in line with our expectations: respondents who state finding it easy to
switch health plans, who switched health plans in the last five years and who are dissatisfied
with their health insurer were significantly more likely to switch. The second question tested
respondents’ switching propensity when a competing health plan lowers its premium with 10
dollar/euro. 36 In total 2231 respondents stated they were willing to switch health plans. Figure
10 summarizes the main results (question 2, model 1). Again we find strong evidence for
relative thinking; the responses are even somewhat stronger (and again significant): 𝛼𝛼�1 =

19.3% > 𝛼𝛼�2 = 10.0% > 𝛼𝛼�3 = 4.5% > 𝛼𝛼4 = 0. 37 The marginal effects of the explanatory

variables in Table 3 are similar as in the first question. To summarize, the responses in both
questions clearly reject the null hypothesis and provide evidence of a “relative thinking”
effect.

*

The numbers in the columns represent the percentage of respondents that answered (very) likely to
switch to another health plan. One minus this number represents the percentage of respondents who
answered (very) unlikely. Each color represents a reference premium, blue, 0; red 50; grey, 100, and
yellow 200 dollar/euro. TOTAL represent the sum of all US, German and Dutch (NL) respondents.

35

For example, Royalty and Solomon (1999) find evidence that transition costs are higher for older and less
healthy employees. They find lower price elasticities for the higher educated indicating higher time costs.
36
The exact question was: “You pay a monthly premium of [0, 50, 100, 200] dollar. You find out that another
health insurer sets its monthly premium 10 dollar lower than your current insurer. How likely would you be to
switch to this other health insurer?”.
37
Especially for the US we observe stronger responses for the zero reference premium category.

28

Presence of a “zero-price” effect
We identify the possible presence of a “zero-price” effect by testing whether switching
responses are stronger for a reference premium of zero. In the last rows of Table 3 we present
our results for Model 2. 38 We cannot reject the presence of a zero price effect in Model 2:
𝜃𝜃�2 > 0 (and 𝜃𝜃�1 < 0), albeit only a significant result for the second question. For individual
countries we find significant zero price effects for the Netherlands (both questions) and

Germany (question 2). 39 Thus, our results indicate that – at least in the Netherlands and
Germany – switching responses are higher at a zero premium level, suggesting the presence
of a “zero-price” effect.
4.5. Limitations
The main purpose of our survey was to test the null-hypothesis of no relative thinking. We
found that the null can be rejected and that a “relative-thinking” and a “zero-price” effect are
likely to be present. However, since our survey involves hypothetical choices, the magnitude
of the effects we find are likely to be quite different from actual choice settings when real
money is at stake. We test for stated behavior and do not consider well-known barriers to
health plan switching such as consumer inertia, search costs and information frictions (Handel
2013, Handel and Kolstad 2015). Obviously, it is much easier to say one intends to switch
plans than actually doing so in real life. Therefore the hypothetical switching propensities we
find are much higher than those observed in real health insurance markets. This difference is
likely to be reinforced by the nature of our sample recruitment process, since the participants
to our survey are apparently willing to act on the basis of a small price.
We would like to emphasize, however, that our hypothetical choice experiment is not
meant to provide reliable estimates of the magnitude of actual switching rates, but to detect
whether different reference premiums elicit different behavioural responses. We argue that
our consistent finding of different responses to different reference premiums in three different
settings provides evidence of the relevance of relative thinking in health plan switching
decisions. The magnitude of this effect in real world health insurance settings, is an
interesting subject for further research.

38

We do not report the marginal effects of the background variables; they are very similar to those in Model 1.
The results are available from the authors upon request. Note that the non-linear effect is clearly visible for
Germany and the Netherlands in Figure 10, if one keeps in mind that the first three reference premiums have an
equi-distance of 50 euro while the last two reference premiums have a larger distance of 100 euro. For Germany
(question 1) and the US (question 2) we find positive zero price-effects but not significant. It remains a puzzle
why we do find a (not significant) negative zero-price effect for the US in question 1.

5. Conclusion

Both the hypothetical survey experiment and the observed equilibria in three large markets
with premium subsidies suggest that relative thinking and reference pricing, and especially a
reference price of zero, impact health plan choice and price competition. Policymakers (or
other sponsors) already use the level of premium subsidies as a policy tool to achieve access
to health insurance. Our research suggests subsidy level and design could involve another set
of considerations having to do with the effect of the subsidy on demand response and price
competition. For purposes of this discussion, we will assume that in addition to access to
health insurance, the sponsor would like to increase demand response to price and thereby
heighten price competition among plans. A first policy implication is that policymakers can
increase demand response by increasing a fixed subsidy as a share of the total health
insurance payments. In the presence of relative thinking, a given price difference has a greater
effect on demand if the level of consumer prices lowers consumers’ reference prices. If a
certain level of public subsidy is justified based on access and equity considerations, this
additional benefit from a subsidy increase implies that subsidies should be greater than based
on access/equity alone.

A subsidy can be set “too high” in terms of its effect on demand response and competition.
We counsel special caution setting subsidies such that the reference prices become near zero,
a kind of “black hole” with respect to price competition. Relative thinking is most powerful
as prices approach zero. In other words, once consumers get something “free” is is hard to
dislodge them from this state. It is true that health plans would be highly penalized by setting
a positive price if consumers’ reference price is zero, but this is a good thing only if the
optimal price is not positive. The powerful reference effects creating the kink in demand at
zero implies also the equilibrium market price is unlikely to fall below zero. However, if a
sponsor knows the total price/cost for health plans that it wants, and it wants to get that
through market forces, then it can set a subsidy so that the reference price at the target
spending is zero. This manner of increasing demand response of course requires increased
public funds. 40

40

Notice, however, this does not necessarily require additional cross-subsidies, since each individual’s
contribution to the subsidy-fund and the subsidy each individual receives from the fund can be increased with
the same amount.

30

Our research also implies that for a given level of premium subsidies, and thus at no budget
costs, demand reponses can be altered by changing the design or framing of premiums in the
market. First, policymakers can influence health plan competition by increasing (or
decreasing) the salience of reference premiums. As discussed above, the German government
announced a specific premium level that should be sufficient for the average health plan,
requiring health plans charging higher premiums to inform their enrollees about the
opportunity to switch to a cheaper health plan. The choice of the “announced premium” is one
that can be made not simply as an accounting issue (what is needed to cover cost) but on the
basis of policy considerations about what would be a desirable reference premium. A
government or other sponsor may believe past costs have been too high because of
inefficiency or market power issues. A no-budget cost way of pressuring plans to compete
more vigorously around the target premium level is to in effect create a reference premium at
that level. Second, policymakers can exploit the evidence we found that the ‘relative thinking’
effect might be non-linear, i.e. that demand responses become stronger when reference
premiums are smaller. This finding implies that the presentation of premiums to consumers
may be important. Premiums can be presented to consumers on a weekly, monthly or annual
basis (or as a percentage of income as in Germany). We leave the question of an optimal
presentation of premiums, that may differ for policymakers and insurers, for future research.

Finally some country specific policy implications can be drawn. Consider the Medicare
Advantage program in the U.S., and suppose we regard Medicare to have fallen into the zeroprice black hole. Health plans “should” decrease premiums to consumers but the sharp kink
in demand at zero inhibits them from decreasing premiums. The inefficiencies associated with
the powerful zero reference price include too few beneficiaries choosing Medicare Advantage
and too much of the shared savings going back to plans put into benefit enhancements rather
than premium reductions.

Medicare could use the Part B premium to reframe pricing to beneficiaries at no budget cost.
The standard Part B premium for 2017 is 134 dollars per month. Suppose, instead of
collecting this “automatically” and framing Medicare Advantage enrolment premiums as
something above or below this, Medicare asked beneficiaries to choose between traditional
Medicare priced at 134 dollars per month and Medicare Advantage plans priced also around

31

134 dollars per month. 41 The former “zero premium” plans would now be 134 dollar plans.
It is true that 134 dollars would likely be the new reference price, but not so much a black
hole. Relative thinking implies that with reframing, a health plan offering somewhat better
benefits at a 150 dollars per month competing with 134 dollar traditional Medicare would do
better on the market than at present when such a plan would price at 16 dollars to compete
with “free” traditional Medicare (and other zero-premium plans). Without such a sharp kink
plans would also have more incentives to compete by offering prices below a reference price
of 134 dollars compared to a reference price of 0 dollars.
In the Netherlands health plan pricing could be reframed to reinforce price competition on the
health insurance market at no budget cost by increasing each individual’s income-related
contribution and each consumer’s risk-adjusted subsidy by the same amount (e.g. 700 euros
per year). Then the risk adjusted-subsidy would equal an individual’s predicted expenses
minus 500 euro instead of 1200 euro, as currently is the case. As a result, the communityrated premiums would reduce to about 500 rather than 1200 euros per year. Due to the
relative thinking effect, the lower premium level may make consumers more price sensitive,
inducing more price competition. This measure would also reduce the number of defaulters
and the deficit per defaulter. 42 In addition, the government may reinforce this relative thinking
effect further by more explicitly setting a reference premium. As in Germany, the government
may require health insurers notifying their enrollees if their health plan premiums exceed a
certain benchmark.

41

The idea in this paragraph was proposed in Newhouse and McGuire (2014). The earlier paper did not frame
the analysis firmly in the framework of relative thinking.
42
In 2016 the number of defaulters – defined as those that did not pay their health insurance premium for more
than 6 months – was about 290,000 (2.3 percent of the total number premium paying enrollees).

* The variable ‘premium increase’ is a binary variable which is 1 if the respondent is likely or somewhat likely to switch
from health plan if their present health plan raises its premium by 10 dollar/euro per month, and 0 otherwise. The variable
‘premium decrease’ is a binary variable which is 1 if the respondent is likely or somewhat likely to switch to the health plan
that lowers its premium by 10 dollar/euro per month (see Appendix C). The other variables concern patient characteristics
and are also shown in Table 2 in the text.

In the correlation matrix in Table B1 we computed the Pearson correlation coefficients. Only
the first two variables are highly correlated. Respondents who tend to switch between health
plans when an insurer raises its premium also tend to switch when a competitive health plan
lowers its premium. Other interesting correlations are that older and less healthy respondents
find it more difficult to switch from health plan. Respondents who find it difficult to switch
from health plan also more often didn’t switch from health plan in the last five years.

Appendix C: Survey Questions
We fielded our survey in Germany, The Netherlands and the U.S., in German, Dutch, and
English, respectively. English versions of the questions are listed here. German and Dutch
versions are available from the authors upon request.
This survey consists of background questions about you and a series of questions about how
much you pay for health insurance. which we refer to as the premium. The premium is what
you pay each month for health insurance.
Backgound questions
1. What is your age (in years)?
18-29
30-39
40-49
50-59
60-69
70+
2. What is your gender?
Female
Male
3. What is your approximate net annual household-income (in euros/dollars)?
0 - 10.000
10.001-25.000
25.001-50.000
50.001-100.000

Prefer not to answer
4. What is your highest achieved education level?
Primary school
High school
College or University
5. What is your employment status?
Work for employer
Self-employed
Student
Unemployed
Retired
6. In general. would you say your health is:
Excellent
Very good
Good
Fair
Poor
41

7. Suppose you want to change from health insurer. How easy/difficult would this be?
I don’t know
Very difficult
Somewhat difficult
Easy
8. Did you change from health insurer in the past five years?
Yes
No
9. Are you satisfied with your current health insurer?
Yes
No
No health insurance
10. Suppose you consider switching to another health insurer. Do you keep in mind a certain
premium when you compare different health plans?
Yes. the premium of my current health plan
Yes. a premium which I have seen elsewhere (newspapers. advertisements. news etc.)
No. I compare health plans without having in mind a specific amount.

Hypotheses-related questions
In the case of a survey with a reference premium of zero dollars, the introductionary text was:
Suppose your employer or the government subsidizes health insurance and that this subsidy is
sufficient to cover the full premium of your current health insurance plan. This means that the
monthly premium you have to pay is zero dollars and thus is free of charge.
In the case of a survey with a reference premium of [50.100.200] dollars, the introductionary
text was:
Suppose your employer or the government subsidizes health insurance and that this subsidy
covers part of your premium of your current health insurance plan. This means that the
monthly premium you have to pay is [50.100.200] dollars
11. Suppose your health insurer raises its monthly premium with 10 dollars. This means that
you now have to pay a monthly premium of [10. 60. 110. 210] dollars. How likely would you
be to switch to another health insurer that keeps the monthly premium at [0. 50.100.200]
dollars?
Very likely
Somewhat likely
Somewhat unlikely
Very unlikely
12. You pay a monthly premium of [0. 50. 100. 200] dollars. You find out that another health
insurer sets its monthly premium 10 dollars lower than your current insurer. This means that
42

you will receive 10 dollars per month (or pay [40. 90. 190] dollars per month). How likely
would you be to switch to this other health insurer?
Very likely
Somewhat likely
Somewhat unlikely
Very unlikely
