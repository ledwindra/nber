Gravity Chains: Estimating Bilateral Trade Flows When Parts And Components Trade Is Important
Richard Baldwin and Daria Taglioni
NBER Working Paper No. 16672
January 2011, Revised June 2011
JEL No. F1,F15
ABSTRACT
Trade is measured on a gross sales basis while GDP is measured on a net sales basis, i.e. value added.
The rapid internationalisation of production in the last two decades has meant that gross trade flows
are increasingly unrepresentative of the value added flows. This fact has important implications for
the estimation of the gravity equation. We present empirical evidence that the standard gravity equation
performs poorly by some measures when it is applied to bilateral flows where parts and components trade is
important. We also provide a simple theoretical foundation for a modified gravity equation that is
suited to explaining trade where international supply chains are important.

INTRODUCTION

Trade is measured on a gross sales basis while GDP is measured on a value added basis. For the
first decades of the postwar period, this distinction was relatively unimportant. Trade in
intermediates was always important, but it was quite proportional to trade in final goods. The
rapid internationalisation of supply chains in the last two decades has changed this (Yi 2003).
Indeed, such trade has in recent decades boomed between advanced nations and emerging
economies as well as among emerging nations – especially in Asia, where the phenomenon is
known as “Factory Asia”. There are, however, similar supply chains in Europe and between the
US and Mexico (Kimura, Fukunari, Yuya Takahashi and Kazunobu Hayakawa 2007). As a
result, gross trade flows are increasingly unrepresentative of the value-added flows. This fact has
important policy implications (Lamy 2010), but it also has important implications for one of
trade economists‟ standard tools – the gravity equation.
The basic point is simple. The standard gravity equation is derived from a consumer expenditure
equation with the relative price eliminated using a general equilibrium constraint (Anderson
1979, Bergstrand 1985, 1989, 1990). The corresponding econometrics widely used today is
based on this theory (Anderson and Van Wincoop 2003). As such the standard formulation –
bilateral trade regressed on the two GDPs, bilateral distance and other controls – is best adapted
to explaining trade in consumer goods. When consumer trade dominates, the GDP of the
destination nation is a good proxy for the demand shifter in the consumer expenditure equation;
the GDP of the origin nation is a good proxy of its total supply. By contrast, when international
trade in intermediate goods dominates, the use of GDPs for the supply and demand proxies is
less appropriate.
Consider, for instance, the determinants of Thai imports of auto parts from the Philippines. The
standard formulation would use Thai GDP to explain Thailand‟s import demand, however, the
underlying demand for parts is generated by Thai gross production of autos, not its value-added
in autos. As long as the ratio of local to imported content does not change, value added is a
reasonable proxy for gross output, so the standard regression is likely to give reasonable results.
However, for regions where production networks are emerging, value added can be expected to
be a poor proxy.
Why do incorrectly specified mass variables matter? A large number of gravity studies focus on
variables that vary across country pairs – say free trade agreements, cultural ties, or immigrant
networks. The most recent of these studies employ estimators that control for the mass variables
with fixed effects. Such studies do not suffer from mass-variable mis-specification and so are
unaffected by our critique. There are however a number of recent studies – especially concerning
the „distance puzzle‟ that do proxy for the production and demand variables with GDP. It is these
studies that our work speaks to.
For example, Rauch (1999), Brun et al (2005), Berthelon and Freund (2008), and Jacks et al
(2008) use GDP as the mass variable when they decompose the change in the trade flow into the
effects of income changes and trade cost changes; Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003) also use
GDP as the mass variable in one of their estimation techniques. Since most of these studies are
concerned with a broad set of nations and commodities, the mis-specification of the mass
variable probably has a minor impact on the results – as the findings of Bergstrand and Egger
(2010) showed. More worrying, however, is the use by authors that focus on trade in parts and

2

components such as Athukorala and Yamashita (2006), Kimura et al (2007), Yokota and
Kazuhiko (2008), and Ando and Kimura (2009). These papers all use the consumer good version
of the gravity model to describe parts and components trade and thus have mis-specified the
mass variable.
Literature review
There is nothing new about trade in intermediates. Intermediates have long been important in the
trade between the US and Canada; the 1965 US-Canada Auto Pact, for example, explicitly
targeted preferential tariff reductions on cars and cars parts. It has also long been important
within Western Europe as early studies of the EEC demonstrated (e.g. Dreze 1961, Verdoorn
1960, and Balassa 1965, 1966). The famous book by Grubel and Lloyd (1975), made clear that
much of intra-industry trade was in intermediates, not final goods, and the importance of
intermediates was reflected in early work by well-known theorists. For example, Vaneck (1963)
presents an extension of the Heckscher-Ohlin model that allows for intermediates trade, and
Ethier (1981) casts his model of intra-industry trade in a world where all trade was in
intermediates.
As better data and computing technology became available, the importance of intermediates in
trade was rediscovered and documented more thoroughly. In the context of efforts to understand
the impact of the EU‟s Single Market Programme, European scholars focused on the role of
intermediates. For example, Greenaway and Milner (1987) list this as one of the „unresolved
issues‟, writing “it is becoming increasingly obvious that a significant proportion of measured
IIT is accounted for by trade in parts and components. [Nevertheless,] most of the models
developed so far assume trade in final goods. The modelling of trade in intermediates needs to be
explored further." The issue attracted renewed interest following development of the new trade
theory in the 1980s (Helpman and Krugman 1985)1 and again in the 1990s with Jones and
Kierzkowski (1990), and Hummels, Rapoport and Yi (1998)2, and more recently Kimura,
Takahashi and Hayakawa (2007), and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008).
The traditional gravity model was developed in the 1960s to explain factory-to-consumer trade
(Tinbergen 1962, Poyhonen 1963, Linnemann 1966). This concept is at the heart of the first clear
microfoundations of the gravity equation – the seminal Anderson (1979).3 This article proposed a
theoretical explanation of the gravity equation based on CES preferences when nations make a
single differentiated product. Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003) use the Anderson (1979)
theory to develop appropriate econometric techniques. Subsequent theoretical refinements have
focused on showing that the gravity equation can be derived from many different theoretical

As illustrated by the Brookings Institution book “The global factory: Foreign assembly in
international trade” (Grunwald and Flam 1985).

Leamer and Stern (1970) informally discusses three economic mechanism that might generate
the gravity equations but these were based on rather exotic economic logics; Anderson (1979)
was the first to provide clear microfoundations that rely only on assumptions that would strike
present-day readers as absolutely standard.

frameworks (including monopolistic competition, and Melitz-type trade models with
heterogeneous firms).4
Studies on the gravity equations applicability to intermediate goods trade are more limited. These
include Egger and Egger (2004), and Baldone et al (2007). The study that is closest to ours is
Bergstrand and Egger (2010). These authors develop a computable general equilibrium model
that explains the bilateral flows of final goods, intermediate goods and FDI. Calibration and
simulation of the model suggests a theoretical rationale for estimating a near-standard gravity
model for the three types of bilateral flows. Using a large dataset on bilateral flows of final and
intermediate goods trade, and a dataset on bilateral FDI flows, they estimate the three equations
and find that the standard gravity variables all have the expected size and magnitude.
The value added of our paper is primarily empirical – to show that the standard gravity
specification performs poorly when applied to flows where trade in intermediates is important.
Moreover, the failures line up with the predictions of our simple theory model that suggests a
gravity equation formulation that is appropriate to intermediates trade. Note that when we
perform the estimates on data pooled across a wide range of nations – as do Bergstrand and
Egger (2010) – we find the same results, namely that the standard specification performs well.
We believe the difference in the results is due to the fact that for many trade flows, the pattern of
trade in intermediates is quite proportional to trade in final goods. This is especially for trade
among developed nations.
Plan of the paper
The paper starts with simple theory that generates a number of testable hypotheses. We then
confront these hypotheses with the data and find that the estimated coefficients deviate from
standard results in the way that the simple theory says they should. The key results are that the
standard economic mass variable, which reflects consumer demand, does not perform well when
it comes to bilateral trade flows where intermediates are dominant. Finally, we consider new
proxies for the economic mass variables and show that using the wrong mass variable may bias
estimates of other coefficients.

2.

THEORY

To introduce notation and fix ideas, we review the standard gravity derivation following Baldwin
and Taglioni (2007).5 Using the well-known CES preference structure for differentiated varieties,
spending in nation-d („d‟ for destination) on a variety produced in nation-o („o‟ for origin) is:

On the monopolistic competition frameworks see Krugman (1980), Bergstrand (1985, 1989),
Helpman and Krugman, (1985); on the Heckscher-Ohlin model see Deardorff (1998), on
Ricardian models see Eaton and Kortum (2001); on Melitz (2003) model applications, see
Chaney (2008), and Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008).
4

Another well-known derivation is from Helpman and Krugman (1985); they start from (1) and
make supply-side assumptions that turns po into a constant, but makes nod proportional to nationo‟s GDP so the resulting gravity equation is similar – at least in the case of frictionless trade (the
case they worked with in 1985).

where vod is the expenditure in destination country-d, pod is the consumer price inside nation-d
of a variety made in nation-o, Pd is the nation-d CES price index of all varieties,  is the
elasticity of substitution among varieties ( > 1 is assumed throughout), and Ed is the nation-d
consumer expenditure.
From the well-known profit maximization exercise of producers based in nation-o,
pod   od mo od , where  od is the optimal price mark-up, mo is the marginal costs, and  od is
the bilateral trade cost factor, i.e. 1 plus the ad valorem tariff equivalent of all natural and
manmade barriers. The mark-up is identical for all destinations if we assume perfect competition
or Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition; in these cases, the price variation is characterised by
“mill pricing”, i.e. 100% pass through of trade costs to consumers in the destination market.6
Here we work with Dixit-Stiglitz competition exclusively, so the mark-up is always /(-1).
This means the local consumer price is poo  ( /(  1))mo oo , where  oo is unity as we assume
away internal trade barriers. Using this and summing over all varieties (assuming symmetry of
varieties by origin nation for convenience), we have:
Vod  no p

where Vod is the aggregate value of the bilateral flow (measured in terms of the numeraire) from
nation-o to nation-d; n o is the number (mass) of nation-o varieties (all of which are sold in
nation-d as per the well-known results of the Dixit-Stiglitz-Krugman model).
To turn this expenditure function (with optimal prices) into a gravity equation, we impose the
market-clearing condition. Supply and demand match when (2) – summed across all destinations
(including nation-o‟s sales to itself) – equals nation-o‟s output. When there is no international
sourcing of parts, the nation‟s output is its GDP, denoted here as Yo. Thus the market-clearing
1
condition is: Yo  no poo
d  od1 Pd 1 Ed . Solving this we obtain that no poo1  Yo / o where o
is the usual market-potential index (namely, the sum of partners‟ market sizes weighted by a
distance-related weight that places lower weight on more remote destinations); specifically it is

Here Pd is the nation-d CES price index, while o is the nation-o market-potential index. It has
become common to label the product Pd1  o as the “multilateral trade resistance” term.

If one works with the Ottaviano Tabuchi and Thisse (2002) monopolistic competition
framework, the mark-up varies bilaterally and so mill-pricing is not optimal.

However, it is insightful to keep in mind the fact that “multilateral trade resistance” is a
combination of two well-known, well-understood, and frequently measured components.
In the typical gravity estimation, Ed is proxied with nation-d‟s GDP, Yd is proxied with nationo‟s GDP, and  is proxied with bilateral distance.
2.1. Gravity when parts and components trade is important
To extend the gravity equation to allow for parts and components trade among firms, we need a
trade model where intermediate goods trade is explicitly addressed. It proves convenient to work
with the Krugman and Venables (1996) “vertical linkages” model which focuses squarely on the
role of intermediate goods. Here we present the basic assumptions and the manipulations that
produce the modified gravity equation.
Krugman and Venables (1996) works with the standard new economic geography model where
each nation has two sectors (a Walrasian sector, A, and a Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition
sector M), and a single primary factor, labour L. Production of A requires only L, but production
of each variety of X requires L and a CES composite of all varieties as intermediate inputs (i.e.
each variety is purchased both for final consumption and for use as an intermediate). Following
Krugman and Venables (1996), the CES aggregate on the supply side is isomorphic to the
standard CES consumption aggregate.
The indirect utility function for the typical consumer is:

V  I / Pc ;

P c  p1A P  ; P 




iG

pi1 di



1 /(1 )

(4)

where I is consumer income, Pc is the ideal consumer price index, pA is the price of A, the
parameter “” is the Cobb-Douglas expenditure share for M-sector goods,  is the elasticity of
substitution among varieties, P is the CES price index for M varieties, pi is the consumer price of
variety i, and G is the set of varieties available.
The cost function of a typical firm in a typical country is:
C[w, P, x]  F  a X x w1 P

(5)

Here x is the output of a typical variety, F and aX are cost parameters, w is the wage, and  is the
Cobb-Douglas cost share for intermediate inputs.7
As noted above, mill pricing is optimal under Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition. This,
combined with the identity of the elasticity of substitution, , for each good‟s use in
consumption and production, tells us that the price of each variety will be identical across the
two types of customers. Choosing units such that aX = 1-1/, the landed price will be:

pod   od wo

1

 o, d

(6)

The assumption that the Cobb-Douglas parameter is identical in the consumer and producer
CES price index is one of the strategic implications in the Krugman-Venables model; see their
book for a careful examination of what happens when this is relaxed (Fujitu, Krugman and
Venables 1999). The standard conclusion is that it does not qualitatively change results but it
does significantly complicate the analysis in a way that requires numerical simulation.

Using Shepard‟s and Hotelling‟s lemmas on (4) and (5), and adding the total demand for
purchasers located in nation-d, we have an expression that is isomorphic to (2) except the
definition of E now includes purchases by customers using the goods as intermediates:

(7)

where Id is nation-d‟s consumer income and Cd is the total cost of a typical nation-d variety.
As before, we solve for the endogenous nopoo1- using the market-clearing condition. In this case,
the value that nation-o must sell is the full value of its M-sector output (not just its value added).
Under monopolistic competition‟s free entry assumption, the value of sales equals the value of
full costs, so the market clearing equation becomes:
1
1 1

 d od

Co  C[wo , Po , xo ]

(8)

where the cost function C is given in (5). Solving (8) and plugging the result into (7) yields a
gravity equation modified to allow for intermediates goods trade, namely:

where Ed is defined in (7) and Co is defined in (8), and  o  d  od

Expression (9) is the gravity equation modified to allow for trade intermediates. The key
differences show up in the definition of the economic “mass” variables since purchases
are now driven both by consumer demand (for which income is the demand shifter) and
intermediate demand (for which total production costs is the demand shifter).

3.

BREAKDOWN OF THE STANDARD GRAVITY MODEL

This theory exercise suggests a key difference that should arise between gravity estimates on
nations and time periods where most imports are consumer goods versus those where
intermediates trade is important. Specifically, the standard practice of using the GDP of origin
and destination countries as the „mass‟ variables in the gravity equations is inappropriate for
bilateral flows where parts and components are important. Of course, if the consumer- and
producer-demand moves in synch – as they may in a steady-state situation – then GDP may be a
reasonable proxy for both consumer and producer demand shifter. But if the role of vertical
specialisation trade is changing over time, GDP should be less good at proxy-ing for the
underlying demand shifters. For this reason, we expect that origin-country‟s GDP and destination
country‟s GDP will have diminished explanatory power for those countries where value-chain
trade is important.
These observations generate a number of testable hypotheses.



The estimated coefficient on the GDPs should be lower for nations where parts trade is
important, and should fall as the importance of parts trade rises.
As vertical specialisation trade has become more important over time, the GDP point
estimates should be lower for more recent years.

7



In those cases where the GDPs of the trade partners lose explanatory power, bilateral
trade should be increasingly well explained by demand in third countries.

For example, China‟s imports should shift from being explained by China‟s GDP to being
explained by its exports to, say, the US and the EU. There are two ways of phrasing this
hypothesis. First, China‟s imports are a function of its exports rather than its own GDP. Second,
China‟s imports are a function of US and EU GDP rather than its own, since US and EU GDP
are critical determinants of their imports from China.
To check these conjectures, we estimate the standard gravity model for different sets of countries
and sectors for a panel that spans the years 1967 to 2007. We run standard log-linear gravity
equations using pooled cross-section time series data, namely:

Y
E
ln(Vodt )  G  1 ln  ot  1dt
  ot Pdt


   2 ln  odt   odt



(10)

A key econometric problem is that the price index Pdt and the market potential index ot are
unobservable and yet include factors that enter the regressions independently (e.g. E, Y and ).
Thus ignoring them can lead to serious biases.
If the econometrician is only interested in estimating the impact of a pair-specific variable – such
as distance or tariffs – the standard solution is to put in time-varying country-specific fixed
effects. This eliminates all the terms multiplied by 1 in equation (10). Plainly we cannot use this
approach to investigate the impact of using GDPs as the economic mass proxies when trade in
parts and components is important. We thus need other means of controlling for  o t and Pdt .
Our baseline specification accounts for the terms  o t and Pdt explicitly. As precise measures of
 o t and Pdt are hard to construct, we perform robustness checks using fixed effects
specifications. To ensure comparability with the fixed effects specification, in the key
specifications we enter the importer‟s and exporter‟s economic mass as a single product-term
into the equation, with the shortcoming of forcing the coefficient of the importer and exporter
mass variables to be the same. Specifically, the term accounting for the product of the trade
partners‟ economic mass is the product of importer-d real GDP (so to account for Pdt ) and of
exporter-o‟s nominal GDP divided by a proxied for  o t , constructed adapting a method first
introduced by Baier and Bergstrand (2001) namely:
 ot 

 GDP
d

1
dt * ( Dist od )



1
1

The elasticity value in the  o t relationship has been set as σ = 4, which corresponds to estimates
proposed in empirical literature (e.g. Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2001 and Carrere 2006).
Turning to the trade cost variable, , we introduce standard trade frictions, including log of
bilateral distance, and dummies for contiguity, and common language. Moreover for robustness
purposes we also test for additional time-varying trade frictions measured by cif-fob ratios, as
proposed by Bergstrand and Egger (2010).
The data used for the bilateral trade flows, and the cif-fob ratios are taken from the UN
COMTRADE database. GDPs are from the World Bank‟s World Development Indicators.

8

Bilateral distances, contiguity, and common language are from the CEPII database. Data for
Taiwan, which are missing from the UN databases, are from CHELEM (CEPII) and national
accounts.
Estimation is by simple ordinary least squares with the standard errors clustered by bilateral pairs
since we work in direction-specific trade flows rather than the more traditional average of
bilateral flows.
3.1.
Empirical results
In Table 1 we report the gravity equation estimates for all goods as well as for intermediate and
final goods separately. Intermediate and final goods have been identified according to the UN
Broad Economic Categories Classification (see appendix). The sample includes all the nations
where data is available, namely 187 nations.
Coefficients have the expected signs and are statistically significant. For all six regressions (all
goods, only intermediates, and only consumer goods with and without time fixed effects) the
estimates are broadly similar. The mass variables are all estimated to be close to unity. The
bilateral distance variable is negative and falls in the expected range. The additional trade cost
measure, the cif/fob ratio, is always negative as expected for the sub-samples, but positive for the
aggregate sample. Continuity and language always have the expected sign and fall in the usual
ranges.

These Table 1 results confirm the findings of Bergstrand and Egger (2010), namely that the size
of the estimated coefficients does not vary for consumer and intermediate goods. As such, it
would seem that our concern about mis-estimating the gravity equation is misplaced. However,
as noted above, if the consumer and intermediate trade is roughly proportional over time, GDP
will be a reasonable proxy for both consumer income and gross value added. The real test of the
stability of the parameters would be on a sample where the importance of intermediates trade
was rising significantly.

To check this, we turn to a sub-sample of nations where we a priori expect intermediate trade to
be both very important and growing more rapidly than consumer trade. Specifically, we estimate
a gravity model as in Table 1, but on bilateral trade between pairs of Factory Asia countries (i.e.
Japan, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Taiwan). To gauge the stability of
parameters, we interact period-dummies with the mass variable. The results, shown in Table 2,
are quite different to those of Bergstrand and Egger (2010) and to those of Table 1.
The baseline regressions (without time interactions) show the fairly common result that the
gravity model does not work well on Factory Asia nations. The estimated mass coefficient is
fairly low at about 0.7. The distance estimate, however, at -0.26 is much lower than the
commonly observed -0.7 to -1.0. When we include time interaction terms for the economic mass
variable, we find that the coefficient is not stable over time. When the standard controls are
included, see column (4), the base case estimate is 0.4 to which must be added the period

coefficients which are 0.3 for the pre-Factory Asia period (Baldwin 2006), 0.2 for the 1987-1996
period, and essentially zero (and insignificant) for the post 1998 period.

Note
s: Estimated mass-elasticity coefficients with year interactions and pair fixed effects (as in (10). High and low bars show plus/minus 2
standard errors; Factory Asia countries: Japan, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan.

To estimate the mass variable‟s instability over time more clearly, we re-do the same regression
but allowing yearly interaction terms. The results, displayed in Figure 1, shows the evolution of
the GDP coefficients. The mass elasticity fall over time, with two clear breaks in the estimated
coefficients, 1985 and 1998.
The timing and direction of these structural changes are very much in line with the literature on
the internationalisation of production. According to many studies, production unbundling started
in the mid-1980s and accelerated in the 1990s (e.g. Hummels, Rapport and Yi 1998). The idea is
that coordination costs fell with the ICT revolution and this permitted the spatial bundling of
production stages (Baldwin 2006). The ICT revolution came in two phases. The internet came
online in a massive way in the mid-1980s, and then, in the 1990s, the price of
telecommunications plummeted with various ITC-related technical innovations and widespread
deregulation (Baldwin 2011). The upshot of all these changes was that it became increasingly
economical to geographically separate manufacturing stages. Stages of production that
previously were performed within walking distance to facilitate face-to-face coordination could
be dispersed without an enormous drop in efficiency or timeliness.
As far as the Figure 1 results are concerned, the notion is that as trade became increasingly
focused on intermediates, GDP became an increasingly poor determinant of trade flows – as

11

suggested by our theory. The impact of the mid-1980s changes and the mid-1990s changes are
clear from the estimated GDP elasticities. More specifically, from 1967 to 1985 the elasticity of
these countries‟ bilateral imports to GDP was stable, with a coefficient of about 0.77. Between
1985 and 1997, it steadily decreased to reach a coefficient value of about 0.60, and after 1998, it
further dropped to a figure close to 0.40. The coefficient estimates for the different periods in
Factory Asia are summarised in Table 2 , columns (4) and (5).

For sake of comparison we also report results of time-year interactions with GDP for bilateral
trade between countries where we a priori expect bilateral trade to be dominated by consumption
goods and/or a stable ratio of intermediates to final goods trade. To this end, we re-run the Table
2 regressions for bilateral trade between each of the EU15 nations, and the US, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand. Because most of the internationalisation of supply chains is
regional rather than global (except for microelectronics), we expect these bilateral trade flows to
be less influenced by the second unbundling that so marked Factory Asia trade. The results,
shown in Table 3 tend to confirm our view that the gravity model breaks down only for bilateral
flows where production sharing is especially important and growing quickly. That is, as
predicted by our theory, we find no breaks over time in the trade coefficients while distance
coefficients have elasticity levels which are closer to unity. None of the time interaction terms in
columns (4) and (5) are significant and the other point estimates fall in the expected ranges.

12

3.2. More precise estimates of the impact of components on the mass estimate
These two sets of results are highly suggestive. On data that is widely recognised as being
dominated by parts and components trade, we find structural instability in the mass variable
coefficient moving in the expected direction. However, on data where this sort of production
fragmentation is not widely viewed as having been important, we find that that mass pointestimates are stable over time.
To explore this more systematically, we consider a more continuous relationship between the
importance of components trade and the point-estimate on the mass variable on the full sample.
Our basic assertion is that the composition of trade flows will influence the point estimates of the
economic mass variables since the standard gravity model is mis-specified when it comes to the
mass variable. The most direct test of this hypothesis is to include the ratio of intermediates to
total trade as a regressor, both on its own and – more importantly – as an interaction term with
the economic mass variable. Of course a mis-specification of one part of the regression has
implications for the point-estimates of the other regressors, so we also consider the ratio‟s
interaction with the other main regressors.
To this end, we re-estimate the basic equation on the full sample of 187 countries for the years
2000-2008 allowing for interactions with a variable that accounts for the share of intermediate
goods over total imports in each particular bilateral trade flow.
The idea here is that GDP as a measure for economic mass should work less well for those
bilateral flows that are marked by relatively high shares of intermediates trade. By estimating the
effect on the full sample, we avoid the problem of identifying the exact sources of the variation
in the coefficients. We implement the idea in two ways.
First we estimate the standard regression but include the share of bilateral imports that is in
intermediates (denoted as Mdinterm/Md). This new variable is included on its own and interacted
with the other right-hand side variables. Table 4 reports the estimated results for the coefficients
of interest.
The regression results tend to confirm our hypothesis. The regression reported in column (1)
includes the ratio on its own and interacted only with the mass variable. The coefficients for
economic mass and distance are a very reasonable at 1.031 and -1.173 respectively (both
significant at the 1% level). The ratio on its own comes in positive as expected (bilateral tradelinks marked by a high share of intermediates tend to have „too much‟ trade compared to the
prediction of the standard gravity equation). The ratio interacted with economic mass also has a
negative sign, -0.129, which conforms with our hypothesis (the higher is the ratio of
intermediates for the particular trade pair, the lower is the estimate of the economic mass
variable). All coefficients are significantly different to zero at the 1% level of confidence.
The other columns report robustness checks on the main regression. The qualitative results on
the variables of interest (the mass coefficient, the ratio coefficient, and the mass*ratio interaction
coefficient) are robust to inclusion of interaction terms with any or all of the control variables.
This confirms the more informal tests based on an a priori separation of the sample.
Interestingly, the interaction term is also highly significant and negative for distance in
specification (2). That is, distance seems to matter more for components trade – a result that is
not in line with our simple model, but is expected from the broader literature on offshoring. For

13

example, transportation costs become more important when trade costs are incurred between
each stage of production while the value added per stage is modest.

Notes: Mdtinterm/Md is the share of intermediate imports by a country d over its total imports. Robust standard errors are reported in

The second approach is to use decile-dummies to permit a more flexible relationship between the
share of imports made up of components and the mass point-estimate. The idea is that the
inclusion of the intermediates-ratio imposes linearity on the relationship. The deciles approach
allows the interaction terms to be non-linear, for example it allows for the possibility of a
threshold effect whereby the interaction is significant but only for ratios that are sufficiently
large. More specifically, the dummies categorises the share of intermediates in total imports, i.e.
a dummy that selects bilateral flows where the proportion of intermediate imports is below 10%,
between 10% and 20%, etc. The results are shown in Table 5. All results are robust to the
addition of other trade determinants.
For the variable of greatest interest, the economic mass variable, the coefficient for the base-case
decile is 0.985 which is very close to unity as expected and very precisely estimated. The
subsequent rows show the additional effects for each decile. What we see is that the interaction
terms are insignificant for shares of intermediates below 50% of total imports. However, for high
concentrations of intermediates, the interaction terms are all negative and highly significant – at

14

the 1% level. The additional effects lower the base case point-estimate by around 0.10. The
distance term is a very reasonable -1.1 and highly significant.

The results in Table 5 suggests that there is something of a threshold effect in operation. What
we see is that the standard gravity specification works rather well for bilateral trade flows where
the ratio of intermediates is not too great. For trade flows where intermediates are more
important, however, we get the by now familiar result that the mass coefficient is significantly
lower. Since this share is indeed rather low for most bilateral trade flows in the world (since
production fragmentation tends to be a regional phenomenon), this may help explain the Baier
and Egger (2010) result mentioned above.
To illustrate the point graphically, we plot, in Figure 2, the point estimates and standard errors
using a candle chart. Here the point estimates of the mass coefficients are plotted as the
horizontal bar; the associated standard errors are show with the vertical bar.

A SEARCH FOR MASS PROXIES WHEN INTERMEDIATES ARE IMPORTANT

The previous section provides clear evidence that the standard gravity equation is “broken” when
it comes to bilateral flows where intermediates trade is important. The theory suggests that the
perfect solution would require data on total costs to construct the demand shifter for
intermediates imports. If the economy is reasonably competitive, gross sales would be a good
proxy for the total costs. Unfortunately, such data are not available for a wide range of nations
especially the developing nations where production fragmentation is so important. On the mass
variable for the origin nation, theory suggests that we use gross output rather than value added.
Again such data are not widely available.
This section presents the results of our search for a pragmatic “repair” which relies only on data
that is available for a wide range of nations. The basic thrust is to use the theory in Section 2 to
develop some proxies for economic mass variables that better reflect the fact that the demand for
intermediates depends upon gross output, not value added.
4.1. Fixes for economic mass proxies
We start with the destination nation‟s mass variable. In Section 2 we showed that a bilateral flow
of total goods is the sum of goods whose demand depends upon the importing nation‟s GDP (i.e.
consumer goods) and goods whose demand depends upon the total costs of the sector buying the
relevant intermediates. The theory says that our economic mass measure should be a linear
combination of two mass measures, not a log-linear combination (see expressions (9) and (7)).
This suggests a first measure that adds imports of intermediates to GDP. The idea here is to
exploit the direct definition of total costs as the cost of primary inputs plus the value of
intermediate inputs. For any given local firm, some of the intermediates it purchases will be from
local suppliers, but summing across all sectors and firms within a single nation, such
intermediates will cancel out leaving only payments to local factors of production and imports of

16

intermediates. Our first pragmatic fix therefore is to measure the destination nation‟s demand
shifter by:

Ed  Yd  i o Vdinterm
,i

(11)

where Vinterm is the value of bilateral imports of intermediates. If we summed across all partners,
this measure would include part of the bilateral flow to be explained (namely intermediates from
nation-o to nation-d). To avoid putting the trade flow to be explained on both sides of the
equation, we build the measure for each pair in a way that excludes the pair‟s bilateral trade.
For the economic mass variable size pertinent to the origin nation, we are trying to capture gross
output that must be sold. The proposed measure is a straightforward application of the theory; it
uses the origin nation‟s value added in manufacturing and its purchases of intermediate inputs
from all sources except from itself (due to a lack of data).

Co  AVomanuf  i 0 Vi ,ionterm

(12)

Note that our specification of the gravity equation uses the exports from nation-o to nation-d, so
the second term in this does not include the bilateral flow to be explained. The second term
involves nation-o‟s imports from all nations, not its exports to nations.
4.2. Empirical results
To test whether these proposed proxies work better than GDP, we run regressions like those
reported in Table 4 but with the new proxies for economic mass replacing the standard proxy
(i.e. GDP). The results are shown in Table 6.
The results in Table 6 – compared with those in Table 4 – suggest that our proxies work better
than GDP. The key piece of evidence can be seen in column (1). This includes the ratio of
intermediates in total bilateral trade both on its own and interacted with the mass variable. The
lack of significant of the ratio in either role suggests that our new proxy is doing a better job than
GDP did in picking up demand and supply of intermediates.
Interestingly, the column (2) regression, which allows an interaction between distances on the
ratio of intermediates, suggests that the distance coefficient may also be mis-specified. When the
ratio is interacted with distance, the distance estimate falls somewhat on average but especially
for trade flows where parts and components are especially important (i.e. the ratio is high).
This suggests that distance is more important, not less, for bilateral trade flows dominated by
intermediates. The finding may reflect the well-known fact that most production fragmentation
arrangements are regional, not global (components trade is more regionalised that overall trade).
This result, however intriguing, does not really stand up to minor changes in the specification. In
regression (4), which includes the ratio‟s interaction with all variables, the distance result fades;
indeed only the common language effect seems to be magnified for trade flows marked by
particularly high ratios of intermediates.

Mdinterm/Md is the share of intermediate imports by a country d over its total imports. New mass variables defined in the text.

Importantly, we note that in all specifications, the ratio‟s interaction term on the economic mass
is always insignificant. This suggests that our new mass proxies are doing a better job of picking
up the true supply and demand variables including intermediates.
For symmetry, and to check for non-linear interaction terms, we use our new mass proxies in a
regression akin to Table 5. The idea is to use ratio decile dummies instead of the ratio itself in
order to allow the interactions to vary non-linearly for bilateral flows marked by different
degrees of intermediates trade. The results are shown in Table 7.
To interpret our findings, recall that the significant of the upper-tier decile interaction terms was
taken as evidence that GDP was not working well for trade flows marked by much trade in
intermediates. Thus the results in Table 7 suggest that our new proxy is working better than
GDP.
Specifically, the base-effect for our economic mass variable and the distance coefficients are
estimated at very reasonable point estimates (0.88 and -1.1 respectively). Critically, only one of
the decile interaction terms is significant, and it is positive, not negative as the theory would
suggest. Two other interaction terms are borderline significant and negative, the ones for the
sixths and tenth deciles.

WHY DO INCORRECTLY SPECIFIED MASS VARIABLES MATTER?

A large number of gravity studies focus on variable that vary across country pairs – say free
trade agreements, cultural ties, or immigrant networks. The most recent of these studies employ
estimators that control for the mass variables with fixed effects.8 Such studies do not suffer from
mass-variable mis-specification and so are unaffected by our critique.
There are however as mentioned in the introduction, a number of recent studies – especially
concerning the „distance puzzle‟ that do proxy for the production and demand variables with
GDP. It is these studies that our work speaks to.9

These econometric techniques were introduced by Harrigan (1996), Head and Mayer (2000),
and Combes, Lafourcade and Mayer (2005), Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003), and Feenstra
(2004).

However, since most of these studies are concerned with a broad set of nations and commodities,
the mis-specification of the mass variable probably has a minor impact on the results – as the
findings of Bergstrand and Egger (2010) showed and we confirmed with our Table 1 results.
More worrying, however, is the use by authors that focus on trade in parts and components.10
These papers use the consumer-good version of the gravity model and thus mis-specify the mass
variable.
Once the equation is mis-specified – in particular the standard economic mass proxies are not
correctly reflecting the supply and demand constraints – we are in the realm of omitted variable
biases. The first task is to explore the nature of the biases that would arise from this misspecification. To simplify, assume away GDPs and distance and focus on a pair-wise policy
variable, say, nation-d‟s tariffs on imports from nation-o; we denote this as Tod. The estimated
gravity equation will have the following structure:

ln Vodt  constant  a 5 ln Todt   odt

(13)

where the error is assumed to be iid.
Because intermediates supply is measured by total costs rather than GDP, and the supply of
intermediates that must be sold depends upon gross output rather than value added. This means
that the true model includes an additional term. That is:

ln Vodt  a 0  a 5 ln Todt  a 6 ln Z odt   odt

(14)

where Zodt is the difference between the GDP-based mass variables and the true mass variables
as specified in (7). We can write Zodt as a function of Todt in an auxiliary regression:

ln Z odt  b 0  b1 ln Todt  uodt

(15)

where u is assumed to be iid. Using this notation for the coefficients of the auxiliary regression,
we can see that in estimating (13), we are actually estimating:

ln Vodt  (a 0  bo a6 )  (a 5  a 6  b1 ) ln Todt  ( odt  a6 uodt )

(16)

What this tells us is that the coefficient on the policy variable of interest will almost surely be
biased. The point is that the only way it is not biased is if there is no correlation between the misspecification of the economic mass variables and the policy variable.
What sort of correlation should we expect? Recall that the mis-measurement of the economic
mass variable all goes back to the importance of trade in intermediate goods. Since almost all
bilateral variables of interest are things that affect bilateral trade flows, it seems extremely likely
that the variable of interest will also affect the flow of intermediates. As long as it does, then we
know that the mis-specification of the mass variable will also lead to a bias in the pair-wise
variables.11

Athukorala and Yamashita (2006), Kimura et al (2007), Yokota and Kazuhiko (2008), and
Ando and Kimura (2009).
10

As noted above, the modern techniques for controlling for mass with time-varying countryspecific dummies eliminates such biases since they correctly control for the role of intermediates.
11

For example, let us suppose that tariffs discourage trade overall, but they especially discourage
intermediates trade (for the usual effective rate of protection reasons, i.e. the tariff is paid on the
gross trade value but its incidence falls on the value added only). In this case, we should expect
low tariffs to encourage two things, an overall increase in trade and an increase in the ratio of
intermediates. In this case, the bias in the mis-specified gravity equation is likely to be negative,
since the policy variable is negatively correlated with the omitted variable. Furthermore, the misspecification also affects the standard errors, which would result in a biased inference
(Wooldridge, 2003, ch.4).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we present empirical evidence that the standard gravity model performs poorly by
some measures when it is applied to bilateral flows where parts and components trade is
important. The paper also provides a simple theoretical foundation for a modified gravity
equation that is suited to explaining trade where international supply chains are important.
Finally we suggest ways in which the theoretical model can be implemented empirically.
