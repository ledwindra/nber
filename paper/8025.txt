1. Introduction
This paper studies data spanning 1980–2000 on prices, output, money and interest rates in the
countries constituting the euro area, and focuses on the question of what role the ECB should
attach to broad money in its conduct of policy. It is motivated by two observations. First, the
Eurosystem has adopted a monetary policy framework which emphasizes the role of monetary
aggregates (see ECB [14]). While it has made clear that monetary targeting would not be appropriate under current conditions (Issing [21]), the Eurosystem’s announcements suggest that
broad money growth is a major information variable used when setting policy. Second, it is
sometimes claimed that the Bundesbank’s and the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB’s) outstanding
record of in‡ation control stemmed from their use of monetary targeting. However, a number
of scholars of German monetary policy have argued that the Bundesbank’s “pragmatic” monetary targeting was best viewed as monetary targeting in words only, but in‡ation targeting
in deeds.1 Similarly, many observers have interpreted the SNB’s policy decisions as suggesting
that the deviation of the monetary base from target was by no means the sole factor in‡uencing
policy.2 Furthermore, in December 1999, the SNB [40] o¢cially abandoned monetary targeting, announced a de…nition of price stability similar to the Eurosystem’s, and declared that
“[m]onetary policy decisions will be based mainly on an in‡ation forecast, which will take all
relevant indicators into account.”
The Eurosystem has announced that it relies heavily on two “pillars” in determining the
appropriate level of interest rates. The …rst of these is a money-growth indicator, de…ned as the
deviation of M3 growth from a reference value, which under normal circumstances is supposed to
signal “risks to price stability” (ECB [14]). The second pillar is an in‡ation forecast, referred to
as a “broadly-based assessment of the outlook for future price developments.” The prominence
given to the money-growth indicator has been criticized, for instance by Svensson [35], on the
grounds that it may be a poor predictor of the future path of prices and that instead the second
pillar, the in‡ation forecast, is likely to be considerable more useful in assessing risks to price
stability.
Against this background, the paper examines the role of monetary aggregates as indicators of
future in‡ation when gearing policy to maintaining price stability. We are particularly concerned

by the question of what forms of monetary indicators are useful, if money does indeed play an
important role in in‡uencing in‡ation a year or two ahead. For instance, does the Eurosystem’s
money-growth indicator provide information about the future course of in‡ation? If so, is it
more informative than a “price gap” or a “real money gap”?3 We also investigate whether
monetary indicators dominate output gaps as information variables for future in‡ation.
We note from the outset that an unavoidable problem in studying monetary relationships in
the euro area is the fact that there is little data from the period after the introduction of the euro
on January 1, 1999. One possible reaction to this is to conclude that empirical work had better
wait until more data is available. Alternatively, one can construct measures of aggregate money,
prices, output and interest rates in the countries forming the euro area for the period before the
introduction of the euro, and use these to study the information content of money.4 Of course,
in doing so one must hope that the dynamic relationships between the data will remain broadly
stable even after the introduction of the euro, in de…ance of the Lucas critique. In this paper
we take this second route, fully recognizing the problems that are implicit in the strategy.5
To preview our results, we …nd that the so-called P ¤ model has substantial empirical support.
Thus, the “price gap”, or equivalently and in our view preferably,6 the “real money gap” (de…ned
as the gap between current real money balances and long-run equilibrium real money balances)
contains considerable information about the future path of in‡ation. Furthermore, and perhaps
surprisingly, the real money gap has more predictive power than the output gap. These results
suggest that the real money gap should be an important information variable for the Eurosystem.
Furthermore, we …nd that while the Eurosystem’s money-growth indicator (the gap between
current M3 growth and the Eurosystem’s reference value) does have some predictive power
for future in‡ation, this information is already embedded in the real money gap.7 Thus, the
money-growth indicator has no marginal predictive power in the presence of the real money gap.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses in‡ation, output, money and interest
3
The role of indicators in monetary policy is discussed in a classic papers by Kareken, Muench and Wallace
[23] and Friedman [15]. A recent more general discussion is in Svensson [36, section 3.3]. Svensson and Woodford
[39] provide a rigorous analysis of the role of indicators for optimal policy in a model with partial information
and forward-looking variables.
4
Wesche [46] takes this approach and estimates P ¤ -models on aggregated data for various European groupings
of countries.
5
A third route is to use U.S. data, on the ground that the Euro area will be a closed economy of similar size
as the U.S., and that therefore results about U.S. relations between in‡ation, interest rates, output and money
should be of some relevance for the Euro area. This route is followed in Rudebusch and Svensson [33].
6
In our view, the concept “real money gap” is preferable because it (1) refers directly to monetary aggregates
(which is advantageous in a discussion of the predictive power of monetary aggregates), (2) is consistent with the
insight that demand for money is demand for real money, (3) gives a precise meaning to the (somewhat imprecise)
notion of “monetary overhang,” and (4) lends itself to comparision with the output gap.
7
The issue of the existence of a direct real-money e¤ect on output, argued by Meltzer [25] and Nelson [26], is
not examined in this paper.

rates in theory. Section 3 examines the corresponding empirical relations between these variables in euro-area data, including the empirical properties of monetary indicators, especially the
Eurosystem’s money-growth indicator. Section 4 presents some conclusions.

2. In‡ation and money in theory
In this section we set out a minimum model of the determination of prices. The model emphasizes
the role of monetary factors in the in‡ation process and consists of an in‡ation equation and a
money-demand equation. In what follows, all variables (except interest rates and time) are in
natural logarithms. Logs and interest rates are scaled by one hundred; hence they are measured
in percent. Time should be thought of as being measured in quarters.
2.1. In‡ation determination
The starting point for our analysis is a Phillips curve of the form
¼t+1 = ¼et+1;t + ®y (yt ¡ yt¤ ) + ®z zt+1 + "t+1 ;

(2.1)

where ¼t ´ 4¢pt ´ 4(pt ¡ pt¡1 ) is the annualized in‡ation rate in quarter t, pt is the price level,

¼et+1;t is expectations in quarter t of in‡ation in quarter t + 1 (which we specify further below),

yt is output, yt¤ is potential output, yt ¡yt¤ is the output gap, zt is any exogenous variable or shift
factor (for instance, a supply shock) (we discuss the dating of the exogenous variable further
below), and "t an iid “cost-push” shock, and where ®y > 0.
In P ¤ models (see Hallman, Porter and Small [19] and Tödter and Reimers [42]), in‡ation
is instead assumed to be governed by
¼t+1 = ¼et+1;t ¡ ®p (pt ¡ p¤t ) + ®z zt+1 + "t+1 ;

(2.2)

where ®p > 0. Thus, the P ¤ model replaces the output gap with the negative of the “price gap,”
pt ¡ p¤t , as the key determinant of in‡ation.8 Here p¤t , the long-run equilibrium (LRE) price
level, denotes the price level that would result with the current money stock, provided output
is at potential and velocity at its long-run equilibrium level. Thus, p¤t is de…ned as
p¤t ´ mt + vt¤ ¡ yt¤ ;

(2.3)

where mt is the money stock (in empirical work typically M2 or M3), vt ´ pt +yt ¡mt is velocity,
and vt¤ is the LRE velocity, which we specify further below.
8

Some of the literature has de…ned the price gap with the opposite sign, as p¤t ¡ pt .

3

While the microfoundations of the P ¤ model are not clear (to us, at least), the model has
been used to account for the behavior of prices in a number of countries, and is typically seen
among proponents for monetary targeting as providing a theoretical rationale for focusing policy
deliberations on the behavior of monetary aggregates.9 For these reasons, we use the P ¤ set-up
here.10
Since we focus on the role of monetary aggregates, it is instructive to follow Svensson [37]
~ ¤t , where m
and express the P ¤ model in terms of the real money gap, m
~t ¡m
~ t ´ mt ¡ pt is real
money balances and
m
~ ¤t ´ mt ¡ p¤t ´ yt¤ ¡ vt¤

(2.4)

is LRE real money balances. Since the real money gap is the negative of the price gap,
~ ¤t ´ (mt ¡ pt ) ¡ (mt ¡ p¤t ) = ¡(pt ¡ p¤t );
m
~t ¡m

(2.5)

we can then write the P ¤ model as
~ ¤t ) + ®z zt+1 + "t+1 ;
~t ¡m
¼t+1 = ¼ et+1;t + ®m (m

(2.6)

where ®m ´ ®p > 0. The P ¤ model consequently assigns a crucial role to the real money gap
as a predictor of future in‡ation, analogous to the role of the output gap in traditional Phillips
curves. One immediate consequence of this is that, to the extent the P ¤ model accounts for the
behavior of in‡ation, the real money gap, rather than nominal money growth, is the natural
indicator of future in‡ation. We show in the empirical part of the paper that this is the case in
the euro-area data we consider.
2.1.1. In‡ation expectations
To make the in‡ation equation operational, we need to specify how expectations are formed. For
a forward-looking Phillips curve, the rational expectations hypothesis is typically invoked.11 For
9

The P ¤ model is used to discuss Bundesbank monetary targeting in Jahnke and Reimers [22], Neumann [27],
Tödter and Reimers [42], Tödter and Ziebarth [43] and von Hagen [45]. This may give the impression that the
P ¤ model provides some rationale for money-growth targeting, especially since the P ¤ model seems to be part of
the Bundesbank’s view of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, see Jahnke and Reimers [22]. Svensson
[37] shows that, although the P ¤ model gives a prominent role to monetary aggregates, in particular the “real
money gap,” it does not provide a rationale for money-growth targeting.
Hallman, Porter and Small [19] and Christiano [6] discuss the performance of the P ¤ model for the U.S.
10
See Meltzer [25], Nelson [26], Rudebusch and Svensson [33], Svensson [34] and Woodford [47] for recent
discussions of the role of money in monetary policy and the transmission mechanism.
11
See Roberts [30] for discussion of alternative Phillips curves. Bernanke and Woodford [3], Clarida, Gali and
Gertler [8] and Svensson and Woodford [38] discuss forward-looking Phillips curves with in‡ation predetermined
by one period and given by
¤
¼t+1 = ±Et ¼t+2 + ®y Et (yt+1 ¡ yt+1
) + "t+1 ;
where ± (0 < ± · 1) is a discount factor.

a simple backward-looking Phillips curve, in‡ation expectations, ¼et+1;t , are normally modelled
as being adaptive and given by current and lagged in‡ation.12 In addition to past in‡ation
rates, monetary policy makers’ views regarding the acceptable or desirable rate of in‡ation
play an important role in the in‡ation process by in‡uencing in‡ation expectations. To model
this relationship, we let the expected rate of in‡ation also depend on the euro-area central
banks’ average implicit “in‡ation objective,” ¼
^ t , which we specify further below. This objective,
which may be time varying, can be interpreted as the in‡ation rate policy makers would …nd
appropriate in the near future, but it need not necessarily be interpreted as a formal target. In
our econometric work, we model expectations as deviating from the objective according to
^ t );
^ t+1 + ®¼ (¼t ¡ ¼
¼et+1;t = ¼

(2.7)

where 0 · ®¼ · 1. In this formulation, we may interpret 1 ¡ ®¼ as an index of credibility of the
in‡ation objective. The closer to unity this index is, the more credible is the in‡ation objective,
in the sense of in‡ation expectations being more in‡uenced by the objective and less in‡uenced
by deviations of in‡ation from the objective.
Before proceeding, it is useful to consider the behavior of in‡ation in LRE, which we de…ne
~ ¤t , zt+1 ´ 0, "t+1 ´ 0 and ¼et+1;t = ¼
^ t+1 . From (2.6) and (2.7) we
as a situation in which m
~t ´ m
then have that
^ t+1 :
¼t+1 = ¼

(2.8)

Thus, the LRE rate of in‡ation is given by the central banks’ in‡ation objective.
2.2. The demand for real money balances
To operationalize the concept of the real money gap, we must specify the demand for the real
money stock. Following the large econometric literature on the demand for money, we assume
the following simple, but reasonably ‡exible and realistic error-correction speci…cation,
^ t+1 ) + ·1 ¢m
¢m
~ t+1 = ·0 ¡ ·m [m
~ t ¡ ·y yt + ·i (ilt ¡ it )] ¡ ·¼ (¼t+1 ¡ ¼
~ t + » t+1 ;

(2.9)

where ilt denotes the yield to maturity on long bonds, it a short interest rate, ·m ; ·y ; ·i > 0 and » t
is an iid money-demand shock. Since we use a broad monetary aggregate, M3, in the econometric
analysis below, it is unrealistic to assume that money is not interest bearing. Thus, we consider
12

Fuhrer [16] and [17], comparing forward- and backward-looking Phillipcs curves for the U.S., …nds that
a backward-looking Phillips curve cannot be rejected. Rudebusch and Svensson [32], Gerlach and Smets [18],
Peersman and Smets [29] and Taylor [41] have recently estimated such backward-looking Phillips curves for U.S.
and European data.

the spread between the long and the short interest rate, ilt ¡ it , as measuring the opportunity
cost of holding money. This is consistent with the short interest rate being a proxy for the own
return on money, and long bond yields capturing the return on the main non-monetary asset.13
With the dating of variables in (2.9) and the assumption that in‡ation is predetermined one
quarter, it follows that money demand is also predetermined by one quarter.14
Several aspects of this demand function are notable. First, the inclusion of the term ¡·¼ ¼t+1
on the right side of (2.9) allows the adjustment to a long-run equilibrium to be in terms of the
change in the real money stock (·¼ = 0) or the nominal money stock (·¼ = 1), or intermediate
cases between the two (0 < ·¼ < 1). Thus, the equation does not impose instantaneous homogeneity of money demand with respect to prices. Second, the term inside the bracket can be
interpreted as a long-run money demand equal to
m
~ t = ·y yt ¡ ·i (ilt ¡ it );

(2.10)

where we assume that real money balances are normalized so that there is no constant in (2.10).
Third, we de…ne a long-run equilibrium (LRE) as a situation when output equals potential output
^ t+1 , which requires the inclusion of
(yt = yt¤ ), in‡ation equals the in‡ation objective (¼t+1 = ¼
^ t+1 on the right side of (2.9) to eliminate the e¤ect of ¼t+1 in LRE), and the interest rate
·¼ ¼
spread equals its LRE value. On the basis of graph 2 below, we assume that the interest rate
spread is stationary and that the LRE spread is constant. Thus, the LRE real money balances
ful…ll
m
~ ¤t = ·y yt¤ + ·¤ ;

(2.11)

where ·¤ is a constant, equal to the negative of ·i times the LRE spread.15
13
In most economies, time deposits constitute a large part of M3 and act as a bu¤er stock when funds are
shifted in to, and out of, M3. Since time deposits are typically remunerated at rates close to interbank rates,
short rates are a good proxy for the own return on broad monetary aggregates.
14
See Browne, Fagan and Henry [4] for a survey of European money-demand equations. A similar moneydemand equation for M2, although with the short interest rate being the opportunity cost of holding money
and without the in‡ation term on the right hand side, is estimated on U.S. data and used to discuss monetary
targeting in Rudebusch and Svensson [33].

3. In‡ation and money in euro-area data
Having reviewed out model, we next discuss the data, our estimation strategy and the results.
3.1. The data
As noted above, since the euro was launched at the beginning of 1999, there is little data
available. In order to carry out the empirical analysis, we therefore use aggregate data for the
euro area before the introduction of the euro. The data on output, money and short and long
interest rates are somewhat revised data from Coenen and Vega [10]. They were also updated
using the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin. Moreover, we construct measures of euro-wide consumer
prices and of the energy component in the consumer price index, and a measure of the output
gap.16 Potential output is computed by subtracting the output gap from output. While the
data set starts in 1980:1 and ends in 2000:2, estimation starts typically in 1981:4 to compute
growth rates and to allow for su¢cient lags in the regression equations.
To explore the relationship between the variables, graph 1 plots in‡ation and nominal money
growth measured over four quarters, ¢4 pt and ¢4 mt .17 The graph shows that the in‡ation rate
fell sharply from about 11% per annum in the early 1980s to about 2% in 1986, then rose to
about 5% in early 1992, after which it gradually declined and fell to .8% in the end of 1998
before rising above 2% in 2000. Moreover, the rate of money growth fell from 12% in late 1982
to 3.6% in 1997, before accelerating to almost 6% in the beginning of 2000. While there is a
gradual decline in both variables over the sample period, the bivariate relationship between the
two variables does not appear very tight.18 Of course, this is not necessarily surprising, since the
graph disregards changes in real money growth, which would tend to obscure the relationship
16
After 1995:1, the o¢cial HICP and the energy component thereof are used. For the earlier period we
constructed euro-wide consumer and energy price indices by weighting the growth rates of national price indices,
using as weights nominal GDP expressed in common currency. Annual output-gap data were taken from the
OECD, and were interpolated to obtain quarterly data points. In addition, oil prices were converted into euro
(for use as instruments for the Hausman test) using a synthetic exchange rate.
17
We let ¢4 xt ´ xt ¡ xt¡4 for any variable x.
18
ECB [13, Chart 4] presents a variant of graph 1 which gives the impression of a somewhat tighter correlation
between money growth and in‡ation. In that variant, money growth is leaded by 6 quarters and 4-quarter money
growth and in‡ation is smoothed by 8-quarter moving averages. To our knowledge, this is the only empirical
evidence the Eurosystem has provided to date in favor of its money-growth indicator.

between money growth and in‡ation.19 In graph 2 we show the behavior of the short and long
interest rates; these also fall gradually over time. All-in-all, all the nominal variables illustrate
the gradual disin‡ation achieved in the euro area.
To get a clearer view of the role of money in the in‡ation process, we next turn to the
estimation of the empirical model.

Note that, as discussed in Rudebusch and Svensson [33], the relation between in‡ation and nominal money
growth can be illuminated by the identity

¢4 pt ´ ¢4 mt ¡ ¢4 m
~ t;
where ¢4 m
~ t is 4-quarter real money growth. With an empirical money-demand equation like (2.9), real money
growth will not be stable. This will reduce the correlation between in‡ation and nominal money-growth.

3.2. In‡ation and the in‡ation objective
As a preliminary step, it is useful to consider the behavior of in‡ation. There is little doubt that
the decline of in‡ation has largely been due to the growing commitment on the part of monetary
policy makers in the euro area to achieve and maintain low in‡ation. The gradual decline in
in‡ation can therefore be interpreted as corresponding to a fall in the average (implicit) in‡ation
objective, ¼
^ t , of the central banks in the euro area.
Since, as assumed in (2.7), the implicit in‡ation objective in‡uences in‡ation by a¤ecting
in‡ation expectations, we need to model the evolution over time of the in‡ation objective.
This is not a trivial exercise. To do so, we start from the observation that a main purpose of
the European Monetary System, which was founded in 1979, was to facilitate for its members
to reduce their in‡ation rates to levels similar to that in Germany. While the Bundesbank
never adopted a formal in‡ation target, an implicit in‡ation target (referred to as “unavoidable
in‡ation”, a “price norm” or a “medium-term price assumption” – played an integral part in
the computation of its monetary target. Below we refer to this for simplicity as Bundesbank’s
in‡ation target. Moreover, we assume that the long-run in‡ation objective of the central banks
in the euro area was to reduce in‡ation to the level given by the Bundesbank’s in‡ation target.
Of course, with the average in‡ation rate in the euro area about 8 percentage points above the
Bundesbank’s in‡ation target in the early 1980s, it was clear that the disin‡ation had to be
gradual. In line with this, we assume that the euro-area in‡ation objective in quarter t, ¼
^ t,
equals actual euro-area 4-quarter in‡ation in 1981:1 and thereafter converges to Bundesbank’s
in‡ation target, ¼bt , according to
¼t ¡ ¼bt+1 );
¼
^ t+1 ¡ ¼bt+1 = °(^

(3.1)

where ° (0 · ° · 1) is inversely related to the speed of convergence.
To operationalize (3.1), we need to make an assumption about the size of °. To do so,
let T denote the “half-life” of the deviation between the two in‡ation objectives, that is, the
number of quarters it takes to reduce an initial deviation between ¼
^ t and ¼bt to a half. Any
assumption regarding T has then an implication for °, since the two are related by to the
formula ° = :51=T .20 Thus, the problem of selecting ° can be given an economic content. In the
empirical work reported below, we set T = 12 quarters, which implies that ° = :944. Since this
assumption of the half-life of deviations is arbitrary, we have examined the sensitivity of our

We have ° T = 0:5, which results in ° = 0:51=T .

results to alternative hypothesis about T . Assuming T = 8 or 16 quarters (implying ° equal to
:917 or .958, respectively) has no material impact on the results. Graph 4 shows the resulting
in‡ation objective and the Bundesbank’s in‡ation target.21
3.3. Estimating the model
Fitting the model entails estimating the in‡ation equation, (2.6), the weight the public attaches
to the deviation of in‡ation from the objective in forming expectations of the future rate of
in‡ation, (2.7), the money-demand equation, (2.9) and the LRE money demand, (2.11). We …t
the in‡ation and money-demand equations individually using OLS and also as a system using
SURE. Since we use mainly pre-1999 data, but are interested in the determination of in‡ation in
the period after establishment of the euro, we …nd it natural to perform the estimation on data
ending in 1998:4, and use the data 1999:1–2000:2 to study the model’s out-of-sample performance
and to test for structural breaks.
3.3.1. Estimating ·y
In order to estimate m
~ ¤t in (2.11), we need to know the long-run income elasticity of money
demand, ·y . The long-run income elasticity can be thought of as a cointegration parameter.
To estimate it, we follow the Engle and Granger [11] approach, estimate it separately in a …rst
step, then use the resulting estimate in the subsequent regressions.
Thus, we estimate (2.11) separately with OLS. The resulting equation is (1981:4–1998:4),
m
~ t = 1:51 yt ;
(the constant and the OLS standard error are not reported).22 We then treat 1:51 as the true
~ ¤t accordingly.
value of ·y , and calculate m
3.3.2. The real money gap
Graph 3 displays our estimate of the real money gap, m
~t ¡ m
~ ¤t , together with the deviation
of in‡ation measured over four quarters from the in‡ation objective measured over the same
21
The source of Bundesbank’s implicit in‡ation target through 1998:4 is Bo…nger [5], except for 1985 for which
we use 2.5% (see von Hagen [45]). We assume that the in‡ation target equals 1.5% per year from 1999:1.
22
The OLS standard error (which is inconsistent when the variables are nonstationary) is .02. For comparison
purposes, we also estimated ·y by performing a Johansen test for cointegration on a system consisting of m
~ t and
yt . After …rst testing for lag length and the importance of a time trend, we estimated a VAR(3) without a time
trend on data spanning 1981:2–1998:4. Both the trace and the maximum eigenvalue tests rejected the hypothesis
of no cointegrating vector, but not the hypothesis of at most one cointegrating vector, at the 5% level. Allowing
for one cointegrating relationship, we estimate ·y = 1:51, with a standard error of .03.

shows that both variables evolve in much the same way over time. Moreover, and perhaps
more interestingly, the real money gap appears to move somewhat before the rate of in‡ation,
suggesting that it may be useful for predicting future in‡ation.
3.3.3. In‡ation
We combine (2.6) and (2.7) into the in‡ation equation to be estimated,

~ ¤t ) +

where we have also added four lags of in‡ation in energy prices, ¢qt+1 among the regressors.
(Hence, they correspond to the exogenous variable zt+1 in (2.6)). The reason for doing so is that
energy price movements typically account for a large fraction of the short-term variability of CPI
in‡ation. Since such price movements are largely exogenous and not easily undone by monetary
policy measures, we control for their impact by including the current and three lagged values
among the regressors. A further reason for including energy prices among the regressors is that
not doing so would lead to omitted variables bias. Moreover, and more importantly, it would
increase the variance of the residuals and worsen the …t of the equation. This is of particular
concern in our case since it is more di¢cult to reject the hypothesis of parameter constancy, and
the con…dence bands for out-of-sample forecasts are larger and thus less stringent, in a poorly
…tting model.
Table 1, column 1, reports the OLS estimate of this equation, using the in‡ation objective
corresponding to a half-life of deviations of 12 quarters (T = 12). The coe¢cient on the real
money gap, ®m , is substantial and signi…cant at a 1% level (the p-value is less than .0001).
The point estimate of ®¼ (which captures the importance lagged in‡ation for expected future
in‡ation) is .34, which implies that the weight of the in‡ation objective in expected in‡ation is
.66. The rate of change of energy prices are also highly signi…cant. Overall the equation appears
to …t quite well.
Since the contemporaneous change in energy prices that appear among the regressors is
highly signi…cant, it may be argued that the estimates may be subject to simultaneity bias of
unknown magnitude. To guard against this possibility, we conduct a Hausman test ([20]). Using
11

the current and four lagged levels of oil prices expressed in euros, we obtain a p-value of 0.44.23
Thus, we do not reject the hypothesis that energy prices are exogenous.

We also estimate our preferred speci…cation of the in‡ation equation together with the money
demand function (see below), using Seemingly Unrelated Regression techniques (SURE). The
results in column 2 are very similar to those in column one—although the standard errors are
somewhat smaller—and we therefore do not refer to them further.24

informative than the output gap and Eurosystem’s money-growth indicator, both of which might
contain information about the future path of prices. To address this question, we specify the
money-growth indicator as ¢4 mt ¡ ¢4 m¤t , the four-quarter growth of nominal M3, ¢4 mt , less a

reference value for four-quarter money growth, ¢4 m¤t . The Eurosystem, following Bundesbank,

speci…es the reference value as the sum of an in‡ation target and a forecast of potential output
growth, less a forecast of the velocity trend (see ECB [12] and [14]). Thus, we can interpret
¤
¤
¡ ¢vt+4jt
¢m¤t+4jt ´ ¢4 p^t+4 + ¢4 yt+4jt

as a reference value for nominal money growth for the next four quarters, involving the fourquarter in‡ation objective and four-quarter forecast of potential output and LRE velocity. In
the regressions below, we de…ne the reference value as
¢4 m¤t ´ ¢4 p^t + ¢4 yt¤ ¡ ¢4 vt¤ ;
involving the realized (estimated) values of potential output and LRE velocity.
Table 1, column 3, shows an OLS estimate of the in‡ation equation, (3.2), where the output
gap, yt ¡ yt¤ , and the money-growth indicator, ¢4 mt ¡ ¢4 m¤t , have been added as explanatory
variables. Strikingly, the parameter estimates for the real money gap is una¤ected by the inclusion of the other two variables and remain highly signi…cant. By contrast, the parameters on
the output gap and the money-growth indicator are both numerically small and insigni…cant.
Furthermore, the adjusted R-square falls from .71 to .70. Thus, it appears that neither the output gap nor the money-growth indicator contains any marginal information for future in‡ation
beyond that contained in the real money gap, current in‡ation and energy-price changes.
To further explore the information content of the output gap and the money-growth indicator,
columns 4 and 5 of table 1 show regressions using either the output gap or the money-growth
indicator as the key forcing variable for in‡ation. The output gap is then signi…cant at the 1%
level and the money-growth indicator at the 5% level. Moreover, the adjusted R-square falls to
.64 and .63, respectively. Since both variables are individually signi…cant, we include both of
them. The results in column (6) indicate that both are signi…cant.
From the above analysis we conclude that, while the output gap and the money-growth
indicator both contain information about the future course of in‡ation, that information is
embodied in the real money gap which thus appears to be a superior information variable for
future in‡ation. This conclusion is supported by table 2, which shows that the correlations
between the real money gap, the output gap and the money-growth indicator are sizeable. In
13

particular, the correlation between the real money gap and the money-growth indicator is .72.
Thus, one interpretation of the results in column 5 is that the money-growth is but a proxy
for the real money gap (since column 3 indicates that there is no additional information in the
money-growth indicator).

3.3.4. Money demand

Column 1 in table 3 provides OLS estimates of the money-demand equation, (2.9).25 The results
show that the coe¢cient on the error-correction term, ·m , is signi…cant, as is the total coe¢cient,
·m ·i , on the interest rate spread. Thus, an increase in the long interest rate reduces the demand
for money, while an increase in the short interest rate, which we take to measure the own return
on money, increases money demand. The coe¢cient on the negative of the deviation between
in‡ation and the in‡ation objective, ·¼ = :17, is also signi…cant, implying that the adjustment
to the long-run money demand is mostly in terms of the change in real rather than nominal
money. Overall, the OLS estimate of the money-demand function seems quite good. Moreover,
the parameter estimates are virtually una¤ected when the equation is reestimated together with
the in‡ation equation using SURE (see column 2).
25
Note that, by our assumption of in‡ation being predetermined, the inclusion of ¼ t+1 ¡ ¼
^ t+1 among the
dependent variables does not introduce any simultaneity bias.

3.4. Out-of-sample prediction
Our model has been estimated for the sample 1981:4–1998:4. To explore whether it is stable
following the introduction of the euro in January 1999, we construct one-quarter-ahead out-of^ t , and real money growth, ¢m
sample forecast for in‡ation, ¼t ¡ ¼
~ t , for 1999:1–2000:2, using
the OLS estimates of the two equations. However, since it is arguably more interesting to see
what these forecasts implies for 4-quarter in‡ation, ¢4 pt , and 4-quarter nominal money growth,
¢4 mt , we present the results in terms of these magnitudes. The results are displayed in graphs
5 and 6, where the vertical lines show the beginning of the out-of-sample period, the solid lines
show the actual outcome, the short-dashed lines show the predictions of the model, and longdashed lines show 95 percent con…dence intervals. We interpret the result as suggesting that
our models for in‡ation and money growth are both stable out-of-sample. It is notable that the
predictions from the in‡ation equation are quite good even in late 1999, when in‡ation increased
sharply.
To more formally assess the stability of the two equations, we also perform Chow forecast
tests for a break at 1999:1, obtaining a p-value of .52 for the in‡ation equation and .59 for the
money demand function. Thus, these test support the hypothesis that the equations are stable.

3.5. Granger-causality tests
To more informally assess the information content of the di¤erent variables, we conduct bivariate
Granger-causality tests between in‡ation deviations, ¼t ¡ ¼
^ t , the real money gap, m
~ ¤t , the
~t ¡m

output gap, yt ¡ yt¤ and the money-growth indicator, ¢4 mt ¡ ¢4 m¤t , for 2–8 lags. Since the
results did not appear sensitive to the choice of lag length, in table 4 we report indicative results
assuming a lag length of 6.
The results indicate that the real money gap Granger-causes in‡ation deviations. Indeed,
the null hypothesis of no Granger-causality is consistently rejected for all lags below the 1%
signi…cance level. There is also evidence that the output-gap Granger-causes in‡ation deviations,
although not as strong. For some lags (other than 6) the null hypothesis is rejected at 5%
signi…cance levels.
Importantly, there is strong indication that the money-growth indicator does not Grangercause in‡ation deviations. In fact, the null hypothesis of no Granger-causality cannot be rejected
at conventional signi…cance levels at any lag. This result is fully consistent with the Grangercausality tests in Trecroci and Vega [44], who also demonstrate that the money-growth indicator
does not Granger-cause in‡ation.
Furthermore, there is strong indication that the real money gap and the output gap Grangercause the money-growth indicator, whereas the reverse is not true.

The results from these Granger causality test supports our earlier …nding that the real money
gap is a useful indicator of future in‡ation. While the output gap also is informative about the
evolution of in‡ation, it is less so than the real money gap. Finally, the money-growth indicator
does not seem to contain any useful information for future in‡ation. Overall, we interpret these
results as urging caution in employing the money-growth indicator as an information variables
for risks to price stability.

4. Conclusions
This paper provides a preliminary study of the determination of in‡ation and the role of monetary indicators in the euro area, using reconstructed data for 1998–2000. A main …nding is
that the P ¤ model, in which the gap between the current price level and long-run equilibrium
price level is the main determinant of future in‡ation, has substantial empirical support. As in
Svensson [37], given the emphasis on monetary indicators and aggregates, we prefer to express
the P ¤ model in terms of the real money gap (the gap between the real money stock and the
long-run equilibrium real money stock), which is identical to the negative of the price gap. Thus,
we …nd that the real money gap has substantial predictive power for future in‡ation. It follows
that the real money gap should be an important indicator of future in‡ation for the Eurosystem.
We have also examined the indicator properties for future in‡ation of the output gap and the
Eurosystem’s money-growth indicator (the gap between current M3 growth and the Eurosystem’s
reference value). Surprisingly, the output gap seems to have less predictive power for future
in‡ation than the real money gap. Although the output gap seems to Granger-cause in‡ation,
it does not seem to contain any information not already contained in the real money gap.
Less surprisingly (given earlier theoretical and empirical work), the performance of the Eu17

rosystem’s money-growth indicator is inferior to that of the other two variables. In bivariate
Granger-causality tests, the money-growth indicator does not seem to Granger-cause future
in‡ation. Furthermore, it does not contain any marginal information beyond that already contained in the real money gap and the output gap. To the extent the money-growth indicator
contains any information for future in‡ation, it may be exclusively in its capacity as a proxy
for the real money gap and/or the output gap. Thus, we …nd little empirical support for the
prominent role the Eurosystem has assigned for its money-growth indicator.
Moreover, as argued theoretically in Svensson [34], [35] and [37] and demonstrated empirically
in Rudebusch and Svensson [33], but counter to much conventional wisdom, the lack of predictive
power of the money-growth indicator does not depend on the existence of stable short-run
or long-run money-demand functions. In the present paper, the inferior performance of the
money-growth indicator occurs in spite of well-behaved estimated short-run and long-run moneydemand functions.
In interpreting these results, several caveats need to be kept in mind. First, our empirical
results may be sensitive to the exact choice of data. The way the synthetic euro-area data
has been constructed may matter, and it is possible that other measures of the output gap
are more informative about future in‡ation than the one used here. Second, the real money
gap and the money-growth indicator share with the output gap the dependence on estimates of
potential output, which are notoriously di¢cult and uncertain. Third, calculations of the real
money gap and the money-growth indicator also hinge on the assumed stability of the long-run
income elasticity of money demand, which may shift after the introduction of the euro. The P ¤
model breaks down without such stability (see Orphanides and Porter [28] and Rudebusch and
Svensson [33]). Of course, the introduction of the euro might be associated with a shift in the
long-run demand for euro which would make the P ¤ model unreliable, possibly increasing the
relative advantage of the output gap as an indicator for future in‡ation.
Thus, the …rst two caveats above apply in equal measure to all three indicators studied and
do not provide any compelling reason to modify the conclusion that the information content in
the real money gap is superior to that of the output gap and the money-growth indicator. The
third caveat does not apply to the output gap and may hence provide a reason to modify the
conclusions in the direction of increased relative indicator performance for the output gap.
