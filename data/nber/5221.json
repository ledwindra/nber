    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper draws together a variety of openness measures to test the association between openness and growth.  Although the correlation across different types of openness is not always strong, there is generally a positive association between growth and different measures of openness.  The strength of the association depends on whether the specification uses cross-section or panel data (which combines cross- section and time series).  For industrializing countries, which have exhibited significant fluctuations in trade regimes over time, long run averages may not serve as very meaningful indicators of policy.\n\n",
