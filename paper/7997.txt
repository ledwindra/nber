1. Introduction
Japanese financial institutions, in particular banks, experienced large shocks
in the second half of the 1990s. The deterioration of balance sheets forced some banks
to fail or to withdraw from operations abroad. It started with an increase in
nonperforming loans due to bursting of asset bubbles in the first half of the 1990s and
a difficulty compounded by incomplete disclosure of bank balance sheet conditions and
a lack of scheme to deal with near-insolvent banks. Nonperforming loans became an
important policy issue from the mid-1990s, but market participants could not have
enough information to make accurate judgement on how serious the banks’ conditions
were. Since 1995, as some banks actually failed and discussion on dealing with failing
banks took place, investors have changed their evaluation on the Japanese banking
industry in general and individual Japanese banks. In November 1997, two
banks—including one of the top 10 banks—and two securities firms—including one of
Big Four—have failed. Facing with a widespread fear of financial meltdown, the
government decided to strengthen the banking sector. Capital injection—subscription
to preferred shares or purchase of subordinated bonds—into major banks using fiscal
money took place in March 1998 and, again, in March 1999. The last fiscal injection
seems to have put an end to a saga of the 1990s banking crisis in Japan.
How foreign and domestic market participants evaluate the net worth or
default risk of Japanese bank is reflected in two different indicators, stock prices of
banks in the Tokyo stock exchange and the Japan premium (defined as the difference
between the euro-dollar interbank interest rate for Japanese borrowers and that for
European/American borrowers).
In order to extract the Japanese banks’ reputation among stock market

2

investors, we constructed the relative stock prices of the banking sector against the
rest of the economy. The banking-sector stock price index (Banking-TOPIX) has been
publicly available. The bank stock index, BINDEX, reflects profitability, growth
potentials, soundness in balance sheets, and other performance indicators of banks,
judged by stock market investors. Of course, these banking performance would partly
reflect strength of the economy in general. In order to control for the economy-wide
factors, the difference between the bank stock index and “other industries stock index.”
We have constructed the index of general stock prices excluding banking index (TOPIX
less the banking sector). The “other industries stock index”, NINDEX, is defined as the
difference between the TOPIX and the market-value-weight-adjusted bank stock index.
Then the difference between NINDEX and BINDEX is called the banking spread in the
stock markets, or SP. This indicator shows how investors regard the health of banking
sector in relative to the economy-wide business conditions. The spread has started to
become large in 1995 and continued to become larger in the second half of the 1990s.
The relationship between NINDEX and BINDEX has changed over time. In
the long run, the two indices are cointegrated. However, the cointegration relationship
seems to have changed its structure, as the two indices behave differently in the second
half of the 1990s. We employ an econometric test developed by Seo (1998) in order to
determine when a structural change in the cointegration relationship took place.
Although it has been recognized by casual observations that banking stock prices have
deviated from the overall stock prices, our formal test to determine the timing of such a
change is, to our best knowledge, the first in the literature.
The Japan premium shows fragility, in terms of credit and counterparty risk,
of Japanese banks perceived by foreign banks. The premium was added on to the loan

3

to Japanese banks in the eurodollar interbank market. Since large Japanese banks did
not face any premium in the euro-yen or domestic yen-based interbank market, it was
rather a puzzle why they were charged premium in the particular market. However, it
became a symbol of weakness and vulnerability of Japanese banks. In the second half
of the 1990s, whenever bad news about Japanese banks hit international press, the
Japan premium seemed to have increased. Japan premium started to have increased in
the summer of 1995, and, after some fluctuations, disappeared in April 1999.
After the behavior of the bank stock prices and the Japan premium is
described and analyzed separately, the relationship between them is examined. One
hypothesis is that these two mirrors of bank soundness are correlated closely. One
indicator shows vulnerability, then the other follows. Another hypothesis is that one
indicator could influence the other, but not vice versa. In order to test these hypotheses,
a vector autoregression is conducted.
It has been observed by many market observers and policy makers that both
stock prices of banks and Japan premium reflect market participants’ views of
Japanese banks in various stages of banking difficulties. However, changes in these
variables have not been analyzed systematically. This paper is the first to test the
relationship between the Japan premium and the bank stock prices.
The existing literature is briefly described and related to this paper. Peek and
Rosengren (2000) regressed Japan premium on various dummy variables to find that
changes in credit rating of banks, banking failures, and government announcement on
overhauling weak banking system, among others, have contributed to increasing and
decreasing Japan premium. They also found that policies not differentiating weak and
strong banks contributed to an increase of Japan premium. We extend Peek and

4

Rosengren in two fronts. First, we included the banking stock prices as one of the
explanatory variables of the Japan premium regression. The regression is useful for
separating general information that would be reflected in the domestic stock market
(risk to solvency) and those information that are specific to the euro-dollar market
(liquidity risk in the dollar market). Second, we have identified the Daiwa Bank
incident as one of the major news that contributed an increase in Japan premium,
while Peek and Rosengren failed to find such an effect. The difference in the two
studies depends on constructing a Daiwa incident dummy variable.
Ito and Harada (2000) presented a detailed analysis of event studies on the
bank failure news. They showed that prominent failures—starting from the failure of
Hyogo Bank (the first listed bank failure) in August 1995—gradually created the
perception of systemic risk in the Japanese financial system. The event studies
presented in the earlier paper will be summarized in next section
Peek and Rosengren (1997) examined a claim that the large stock prices
declines in Tokyo affected the Japanese banks balance sheets and forced the Japanese
banks to curtail lending at branches in the United States. Shimizu and Ui (1999) used
a game theoretic approach to explain changes in the expectation about bank failures in
Japan. Daigo, Yonetani, and Marumo (1998) found that announcements of various
measures, such as the changes in accounting method, affected bank stock prices.
Brewer, Genay, Hunter, and Kaufman (1997, 2000) analyzed determinants of the
Japanese bank stock prices. Their most recent paper shows that bank failures had
spillover effects on other bank stock prices.1
The paper analyzes the behaviors of bank stock spreads and Japan premium,
and their relationship in the 1990s. In anticipation, conclusions can be summarized as

5

follows: (1) Japan Premium (JP) has sharply jumped up in three occasions, the Daiwa
Bank incident in 1995, the major failures of financial institutions in November 1997,
and the period of nationalizing two long-term credit banks; (2) Bank stock spreads (SP)
increased in response to several financial institutions failures, in particular those in
November 1997; (3) In some cases, a bank’s failure triggered the decline in banking
stock prices in general, or a sign of systemic crisis, but in some other cases, one bank
failure goes without notice in the stock market; (4) The bank stock index (BINDEX)
and the other stock index (NINDEX) had exhibited a comovement until the mid-1990s;
(5) the structural change occurred in the BINDEX and NINDEX cointegration
relationship sometime in the summer of 1995; and (6) Although SP and JP in general
appears to be influencing each other, the Granger causality tests reveals that SP
Granger-causes JP, but not vice versa.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will describe the data
and reviews the results of event studies. Section 3 will analyze the behaviors of
BINDEX and NINDEX. Section 4 will investigate determinants of the Japan premium.
Section 5 will present a vector autoregression model analyzing a dynamic relationship
between Japan premium and the bank stock price spread. Section 6 will conclude the
paper.

2. Data and event studies
2.1. Bank stock price index
We would like to describe the movement of bank stock prices in relative to
other sectors. The bank stock price index is publicly available, but not the index for all
industries except banking. Therefore, we construct the general stock price index

6

excluding banks by subtracting banking weights from TOPIX. Since TOPIX is the
weighted average of 33 different sectoral indices, by removing the banking index from
TOPIX, we can construct general index excluding banking as follows:
(2.1)

TOPIX t = (1 − α t )NINDEX t + α t BINDEX t

(2.2)

NINDEX t =

where α t =

TOPIX t − α t BINDEX t
1−α t

BINDEXMVt
, and BINDEXMV(t) is current values of banking market
TOPIXMVt

capitalization and TOPIXMV is all sector market capitalization.2 All indices, TOPIX,
BINDEX, and NINDEX are adjusted for stock splits. Figure 1 shows the BINDEX and
NINDEX from January 4, 1994 to April 30, 1999 with the number of observation being
1,282.
Insert Figure1.
We may observe that deviations between the two indices are minor before
August 1995, but after August 1995, the two indices started to diverge. The deviations
seem to widen over time.3
The bank stock prices relative to other sectors is defined as the bank stock
price spread, SP:
(2.3)

SPt = ln NINDEX t − ln BINDEX t
In addition, we will construct a weak banks stock price index. This index will

be used to measure the impact of news events, including the failure of banks, on the
weak banks. First, take Japanese banks with low credit ratings (Baa2 and Baa3 for
long deposit credit ratings in the Moody’s Investment Service, Moody’s Global Ratings

Guide), and define the weighted average of these banks’ stock prices as the Baa bank
stock price index.

2.2. Japan premium
The Japan premium is the premium imposed on Japanese banks’ borrowing
rate by U.S. and European banks in the eurodollar market. It reflected counterparty
risk based on the western banks’ belief that Japanese banks had higher risk of default.
Since the Japan premium emerged in the eurodollar market, and not in the euroyen
market, it also reflects the liquidity problem with the dollars, rather than solvency or
liquidity in the yen. In this paper, the Japan premium is defined as the difference
between the TIBOR (the Tokyo interbank Offer Rate, or the dollar interbank borrowing
rate in Tokyo) and the LIBOR (the London Interbank Offer Rate, or the dollar
interbank borrowing rate in London). The TIBOR market participants are mostly
Japanese banks. Therefore, the TIBOR reflects Japanese banks’ borrowing rate with
Japan premium. The LIBOR market has many western banks and only a few Japanese
banks.4 With LIBOR calculation eliminates the extreme values, the Japanese banks’
rates are excluded from the LIBOR calculation. Hence, the difference between TIBOR
and LIBOR is defined as the Japan premium (JP).5
(2.4)

JPt = TIBORt − LIBORt −1
The relationship between SP and JP can be shown in Figure 2. The bank stock

spread data (the difference in the BINDEX and NINDEX, which is normalized as 100
on January 4, 1994) has a trend and is thus considered to have the possibility of
nonstationary. However the data can be assumed to be stationary so that the trend is
not removed by taking first differences in our estimations but a time trend is used
instead. We will discuss this issue in some more detail in subsection 3.3. Note that the
bank stock spread seems to be constant or slightly increasing at the end of the sample

8

period, while the Japan premium has declined dramatically.
Insert Figure 2

2.3. Event study
Ito and Harada (2000) studied how the news of bank failures were received by
the stock market in Tokyo. Table 1 shows the 8 cases of financial institution failures. It
shows the name of failed bank, the announcement date of the failure, and anticipation
(changes in 10, 5, and 3, days prior to the announcement) and reaction (changes in 3, 5,
10 days following the announcement) of various stock price indices (BINDEX, Nikkei
225, the failed bank’s (or securities firm’s) stock price, Baa3, Baa2, and in some cases,
related financial institution’s price index).
Insert Table 1
From the table, we can make the following observations. First, for three banks
that failed in 1995 and 1996, the failed banks stock prices dropped sharply, as expected,
but the other banks’ stock prices, even the weak banks’ stock prices, did not drop after
the announcement of a particular bank failure. Therefore, each of the failures was
regarded in the market as an isolated incident. Second, for the three financial
institutions that failed in November 1997, Baa2 and Baa3 indices, as well as BINDEX,
sharply dropped after the failure announcement. The fall of Baa2 and Baa3 exceeded
the fall of BINDEX. These sharp reactions is consistent with the view that systemic
risk of banking failures was perceived to have increased by these failures. Third,
reactions to the nationalization announcements of the Long-term Credit Bank (LTCB)
and Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) were more muted, except some reactions in Baa3 and
Baa2 index. In the case of LTCB nationalization announcement, it was anticipated for

9

a long time through the Diet debate, so that the reaction in BINDEX and Nikkei225
were rather calm, although Baa2 reacted sharply. In the case of NCB nationalization
announcement, it was not anticipated in the market. However, the reaction of BINDEX
and Nikkei225 were also calmer. Baa3 reacted sharply. The nationalization of LTCB
and NCB was carried out under a new mechanism against systemic failure6 . The
market took these failures without increased fears for systemic risk.
In sum, bank failures in 1995 and 1996 did not trigger bank stock price
declines of other banks, but those in November 1997 brought down stock prices of other
banks, especially those with low credit rating. Systemic risk of the banking system in
general was feared. By 1998, the mechanism to deal with bank failures was in place,
and nationalization of LTCB and NCB was received without a major impact on other
banks’ stock prices in general, but some weak banks were affected.

3. Bank stock price movements
3.1. Correlation
From a casual observation of Figure 1, there seem to be three periods in the
relationship between the BINDEX and NINDEX. The first period is from January 1994,
the first date of our sample, to August 29, 1995, the day before the Hyogo Bank failure.
The two indices show comovement. The second period is from August 30, 1995 to
December 18, 1996. The deviation of BINDEX and NINDEX seems to widen gradually
over this period. The third period is from December 19, 1996 to the end of our sample,
April 30, 1999. The two indices in this period maintain the same degree of deviation, or
the regaining the comovement in changes.
In order to formally show this casual observation, we calculated the

10

correlation coefficient of the two indices. For the first period, the correlation coefficient
was 0.96 (with samples of 414), for the second period, the correlation coefficient
dropped to 0.88 (with samples of 307). The correlation went up again to 0.97 in the
third period with samples of 561.
We can interpret this as follows. Before the Hyogo Bank failure, the banking
industry was quite a typical industry in the economy. The banking stock movement
tracked the rest of the economy quite well. After the Hyogo Bank failure, the bank
stocks started to do much worse than the rest of the economy. The Hyogo Bank failure
was only the beginning of this deviating trend. By the end of 1996, the deviation
between the two indices reached its maximum. From 1997, the deviation seemed to
remain stable.
This assessment may appear contradicting the event study conclusion.
According to the event analysis the Hyogo Bank failure did not alarm investors about
other banks. However, that event seems to be the beginning of the deviation between
the BINDEX and NINDEX. Since the event analysis covers only ten days after the
event, it does not capture a possible structural change over time. The failures of the
large financial institutions in November 1997 are most dramatic and the event
analysis shows that it had a large impact on other banking stock prices. It may be
natural to expect that November 1997 is the turning point. However, the correlation of
the BINDEX and NINDEX increase after November 1997. But, the deviation between
the BINDEX and NINDEX had already become large. The stock market must have
anticipated low returns in the banking sector, including some failures. After November
1997, not only the banking sector but also the economy in general headed for a
contraction (e.g., the GDP growth rate became –2.5%), so that the relative positions of

11

BINDEX and NINDEX may not have changed. Thus, just the event analysis or the
correlation analysis does not give us a definite conclusion. It takes a more formal
analysis to determine when the structural change took place.

3.2. Cointegration of BINDEX and NINDEX
In this subsection, the comovement of BINDEX and NINDEX will be formally
analyzed using the cointegration technique. First, a unit root test is conducted for
BINDEX and NINDEX. Each of the two indices is shown to have a unit root. Then the
cointegration relationship between the two indices with an entire sample period is
tested. Since the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, it suggests that the two
variables are not cointegrated as an entire sample period. This result supports that the
long-run relationship between BINDEX and NINDEX cannot be assessed because of a
structural change. These test results are shown in Table 2.
Insert Table 2, Unit Root Test and Cointegration Test
We suspect that the relationship may have experienced a structural change, as
the preceding section indicates. Our interest is to determine when the structural
change took place as well as whether the structural change took place. We apply a
technique developed by Seo (1998). The Seo’s technique will identify the timing of a
structural change, while most of others test the existence of structural break at a predetermined time7.
The sample period is from January 4, 1994 to April 30, 1999 with a sample
size of 1282. It is assumed that the admissible range of a break point is symmetrically
set at [0.15, 0.85].
Consider a two-dimensional time series, BINDEX and NINDEX, generated by

12

ECM with the 1 lag length what is selected by AIC. The long-run relationship is
estimated as follows:
(3.1)

 NINDEX t − 2 
 ∆NINDEX t −1 
 ∆NINDEX t 
 + Γ1 
 + µ + u t

 = αβ ' 
 BINDEX t − 2 
 ∆BINDEX t −1 
 ∆BINDEX t 

where α is the adjustment vector, β is the cointegrating vector. The tests of a
structural change in joint vector βα and optimal LM test statistics are defined as
follows:

(

∑
t − t t =t

 1 t

∑



(3.4)

Sup LM ni = Max LM ni [t / n]

where τ is assumed to lie in τ * = τ , τ , t = [nτ ]、t = [nτ ] , i = β , α , βα . It is allowed
that one time structural change in the cointegrating vector at the break point τ . The
break point τ intersects two sub-samples, t = 1,2, ....,[ nτ ] and t = [ nτ ] + 1, ....., n .

[nτ ] is the integer operator of nτ .
The test results are shown in Table 3-1 panel B8. The plot of LM statistics is in
Figure3. From the table, Sup LM test rejects the null hypothesis of parameter
stability at the 5% size. In figure4, LM statistics show a spike that exceeds 5% critical
value of Sup LM test around 360. This timing of the spike is approximately in the
beginning of July 1995.

Hence, it can be assumed that the relationship between BINDEX and
NINDEX that used to have comovements, has been broken at around July 1995. Bank

stock spreads in relative to the general stock prices (SP) increased in response to
several financial institutions failures and news of financial troubles, in particular those
in November 1997. That is the result from the event study analysis. On the other hand,
the result in this section shows that the long run relationship between the two indices
has changed earlier than November 1997.
Next, we consider a direct test for structural change with a known break point.
As figure4 shows, the sample period is divided in two sub-samples: the first half is from
January 1994 to June 31, 1995, the latter half is from July 1, 1995 to April 30, 1999.
Consider the following DOLS, dynamic OLS estimation. The long run
relationship between two indices is defined as:
(3.5)

NINDEX t = µ + γBINDEX t + z t

which is called SOLS, static OLS. By including not just the current change but also
past and futures changes of the regressor, the OLS estimator of the cointegrating
vectorγ on this regression is referred to as the DOLS. The estimator is distinguished
from the SOLS estimator based on the cointegrating regression without changes.
When the lag length is picked as 2 for required regularity conditions9, the
DOLS regression is as follows:
(3.6)

NINDEX t = µ + γBINDEX t + β 0 ∆BINDEX t + β 1 ∆BINDEX t +1 + β 2 ∆BINDEX t + 2
+ β −1 ∆BINDEX t −1 + β − 2 ∆BINDEX t − 2 + z t

where cointegrating vectorγ is simply the SOLS estimator ofγ. The shortcoming of
SOLS is that the bias of the SOLS estimator can be large and that the asymptotic
distribution of t value depends on nuisance parameters. The rescaled t and Wald
statistics based on DOLS have the asymptotic normal and chi-squared distributions.
Therefore, the estimator is asymptotically equivalent to other efficient estimators.
Table3-2 reports the parameter estimates by SOLS and DOLS for two

14

sub-samples. The estimates ofγ based on the first half of the sample and the latter
half very different so that the estimates are not stable over the sample. This finding
suggests that the relationship of BINDEX and NINDEX has been broken around the
end of June 1995.
The possibility could be easily tested by the Chow test of structural change,
that is

NINDEX t = µ + γBINDEX t + δ 0 Dt + δ 1 BINDEX t Dt
(3.7)

+ β 0 ∆BINDEX t + β 1 ∆BINDEX t +1 + β 2 ∆BINDEX t + 2 + β −1 ∆BINDEX t −1
+ β − 2 ∆BINDEX t − 2 + z t

where Dt is a dummy variable whose value is 1 after June 30, 1995 and 0 otherwise.
The Wald statistic for the null hypothesis that δ 0 = 0, δ 1 = 0 is asymptotically χ2(2).
The DOLS estimate of (3.7) is shown in Table3-3. Our test can reject the stability of
parameters at the 1% size. The 1% significant Wald statistics support the view that the
structural change occurred in the BINDEX and NINDEX cointegration relationship at
the end of June 1995.

3.3. Changes in SP
In this subsection, we will investigate what kinds of news have caused the
deviation between BINDEX and NINDEX. We will take several dummy variables to
explain the changes in SP (the log difference between the two indices).

The list of dummy variables and expected signs are summarized as follows:
D1: the day after the announcement of major bankruptcies (+);
D2: the news on public funds for recapitalization of funds (-);

15

D3: seven days following the failures of financial institutions (+);
D4: from the start of the Diet discussions on LTCB to the announcement of
nationalization (?);
D5: downgrading of any Japanese financial institutions (+);
D6: Any day that had news on the Daiwa incident during one month following its
announcement (September 26, 1995) (+); and
D7: Any day that had news on punishment by the US regulators on the Daiwa Bank
operations in the United States from the announcement to the U.S. decision to have
the Daiwa withdraw from the United States (February 2, 1996). (+)

For D1 and D5, we use a two-day event window that includes the day of the
announcement as well as the day after the announcement, in order to account for the
fact that market participants may not have time to react for the announcement in the
evening. For D1, D2, and D7, the Nihon Keizai Shinbun, newspaper, CD-ROM on news
articles database, was consulted.

The following model is estimated for the above dummy variables:
(3.8)

7

SPt = β 0 + β 1 SPt −1 + β 2 JPt −1 + β 3T + ∑ α i Di + ε t
i =1

where SPt is the bank stock price spread, (ln NINDEX t − ln BINDEX t ) on day t, JPt −1
is the Japan premium, (TIBORt −1 − LIBORt − 2 ) , on day t-1, β 0 is the intercept
7

coefficient, T is the time dummy variable and ∑ Di is dummy variables explained
i =1

above. Equation (3.8) is estimated by OLS since SPt is shown to be a stationary
variable (the unit root test is shown in Table 2).

16

Table 4 presents the results from estimating equation (3.8) over the period
between January 4, 1994, and April 30, 1999. The news on the failures of financial
institutions (D3) is shown to have significant impact on SP. As expected, failures have
made market participants to believe that the health of financial institutions was worse
than previously expected. While not statistically significant, the Diet discussion (D4)
on the LTCB and a new framework for dealing with failing banks, as it dragged on,
made SP to increase instead to decrease. The effect of downgrading (D5) did not have
statistically significant effects, even though the sign was right, either because the
Japanese investors who dominate the Tokyo stock market ignored the Moody’s rating
or because the downgrading was well anticipated in the pricing.
Insert Table 4.

4. Determinants of Japan premium
To determine what kinds of news have caused the increase in Japan Premium,
especially whether the response of Japan Premium was based on the domestic news or
other news from abroad, the following model is estimated:
(4.1)

7

JPt = β 0 + β 1 JPt −1 + β 2 SPt −1 + β 3T + ∑ α i Di + ε t
i =1

where JPt is the Japan premium, (TIBORt − LIBORt −1 ) , on day t, SPt −1 is the bank
stock price spread,

(ln NINDEX t −1 − ln BINDEX t −1 )

on day t-1, β 0 is the intercept

7

coefficient, T is the time dummy variable and ∑ Di is the dummy variables listed in
i =1

the previous subsection. The lagged endogenous variables SPt −1 and JPt −1 are
ensured to be predetermined. There is no simultaneity problem in the model because of
the time difference as is described in Table 8. Therefore, it can be investigated whether

17

SP made JP to increase. JPt is also shown to be a stationary variable (the test result
is in Table 2). Equation (4.1) is estimated by generalized method of moments (GMM)
because the standard errors of the OLS regression based on the equation had serially
correlated10.
Table 5 presents the results from estimating equation (4.1) over the same
period in the previous subsection. The lagged SP has a significant impact on JP. This
evidence supports the idea that a decline in the bank stock index in relative to the
general stock index has a significant impact on increasing the Japan premium. In other
words, the evaluation of the Japanese banking industry which is determined in the
domestic market has affected the level of the Japan premium.
The news on the Daiwa bank incident (D6) had a significant positive impact
on the rise of JP, which is consistent with investors being uncertain about the
transparency of Japanese banking information and about the effectiveness of the
supervision system in Japan. Therefore the announcement on the incident increased in
JP. Our result is different from that of Peek and Rosengren (2000), who used a one-day
event window for Daiwa bank incident and didn’t obtain any significant effect on the
Japan premium. Rating downgrading news (D5) has a statistically significant effect on
JP. Downgrading Japanese financial institutions as expected raised the Japan
premium. Foreign banks increased a premium in response to more default risk of
Japanese banks as indicated in the rating change. The news on Diet discussion about
LTCB for temporarily nationalization (D4) did have a significant impact on the
premium, probably because the negotiation took a longer-than-expected period and
foreign banks (investors) were skeptical about effectiveness of the Japanese safety net.
The Diet discussion ended with a new measure introducing effective measures to force

18

banks to quickly re-capitalize. However the long discussion reflected skepticism among
investors and increased the Japan premium.
Insert Table 5.
The regression results presented above and in the preceding subsection show
that the news about vulnerability and stabilization of Japanese financial systems have
tended to widen the spread between the bank stock index and the general stock index.
Although the banking spread in the stock markets, SP, has been affected by domestic
news, the news that affected the Japan premium are sometimes different. The Japan
premium tended to increase in response to the news that made international financial
press, such as Daiwa bank incident in N.Y. and downgrading of Japanese financial
institutions by foreign rating agencies. A dynamic causal relationship between SP and
JP is also analyzed by the same results since the two equations, equation (3.8) and
equation (4.1), are in the same form.
The lagged endogenous variable SPt −1 in the JP equation (in Table 5) is
statistically significant, and based on simple t test, the bank stock index is said to
Granger-cause the Japan premium. However, the lagged endogenous variable JPt −1 is
not significant in the SP equation (in Table 4). Thus, the decline of the bank stock
index in relative to the general stock index affects on the increase in Japan premium,
but not vice versa. In this analysis, the t test is equivalent to the F test in VAR with
one lag. In general, the number of lags in VAR system may be larger than one. We have
examined the VAR system with two lags. But, the result was very similar to the one
presented here.

5. VAR with 2 lags

19

In this subsection we present the results of F statistics and impulse response
functions by VAR system with two lags. The two variables, SP and JP, are
contemporaneous intra-day variables, so that they can be treated by a regular time
series model. A vector autoregressive model will be used to test Granger causality. The
VAR model can be written in the following form with 2 lags of the variables:
2
 JPt  = v1  + π 11,i π 12 ,i   JPt −i  + v1t 
π π 22,i   SPt −i  v 2 t 
SPt  v 2  ∑
i =1  21,i

(5.1)

π 21,i π 22 ,i 

where 

v1t 
  is a vector of white noise
v 2 t 

process shocks to the model. In the model, SP is said to Granger-cause JP if lagged
values of SP have explanatory power in a regression of JP.
Only F statistics in the above VAR for the sample period of January 1994 to
April 1999 are shown in Table 6. The “SP lags” in the JP equation is the F statistics,
which is significant, the bank stock index is said to Granger-cause the Japan premium.
However, the “JP lags” is not significant in the SP equation. The causal relationship is
not changed.
Figures4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 display impulse response functions, with periods
measured on the horizontal axis, and impulse shock on the vertical axis. The response
of SP (JP) to an impulse in the other variable, JP (SP) in the system is investigated. We
trace out the effect of one standard deviation exogenous shock to SP (JP) on JP (SP)11.
Impulse response of JP to JP itself (figure5.1) is strong and persistent. Impulse
response of SP to SP itself (figure5.4) is also strong and persistent. On the other hand,
impulse response of JP to SP (figure5.2) is slightly increasing and persistent. An
unexpected increase in the Japan Premium tends to lower Japanese banks’ stock prices
in relative to other stock prices. Impulse response of SP to JP (figure5.3) is negative but

20

nearly zero which is consistent with a result that JP doesn’t Granger-cause SP.
The bank spread in the stock market and the Japan premium both have
contained important information to understand Japanese financial systems. They
explain fragility of the financial systems. The joint analyses of the two indicators show
that announcements which increased the bank stock spread, especially those after July
1995, also increased the Japan premium over time.

6. Concluding remarks
This paper investigates how financial weakness among Japanese banks were
viewed by the market participants in Japan and abroad. Two indicators, the Japan
premium (premium that Japanese banks had to pay over western banks when they
borrow dollars in the interbank market) and the stock price index of the banking sector
in Tokyo, were examined. How foreign and domestic market participants evaluate the
net worth and default risk of Japanese bank is reflected in the two indicators,
respectively. The relationship between the banking index and the index of general
stock prices excluding banking index has changed is examined.
The Japan Premium that started to have increased in the summer of 1995
disappeared in April 1999 as western banks have increased credit lines with Japanese
banks.The decline in the Japan Premium most likely reflects slow improvement of
Japanese banks’ credit ratings by two capital injection, and improved new regulatory
system. The other indicator, the bank stock spread remains high even after JP has
disappeared. Therefore it seems that Japanese financial crisis (high default risk) has

21

ended in April 1999,but profitability of Japanese banks (in relative to other sectors in
the Japanese economy) remains low.
We presented how the news of bank failures were received by the stock market
and found that bank failures in November 1997 brought down stock prices of other
banks. Systemic risk of the banking sector was feared in that period. Stock prices of
banks with low credit rating were especially hard hit. News on bank failure increased
the spread between the bank stock index and the general stock index.
We also examined what kinds of news have caused the Japan premium and
the deviation of two stock indices. Changes in the spread were influenced by the
domestic news about vulnerability and stabilization of Japanese financial systems.
However, changes in Japan premium were influenced by domestic news as well as news
from abroad.
In order to formally show the deviation of bank and general stock indices, we
calculated the correlation coefficient of those indices. The correlation coefficient smaller
in the period when the deviation seems to widen gradually, so that we became inferred
to find that structural relationship between the two indices have changed over time.
We employed an econometric test that a structural break occurred at the end of June
1995.
News that affected Japan premium and the deviation of two stock indices were
not identical. Based on the OLS regression, news on the failures of financial
institutions were shown to have significant impacts on the spread of the two stock
indices. In the same way, we found that the lagged spread of two indices had a
significant impact on the Japan premium. Therefore it is true that the evaluation of
the Japanese banking industry which is determined in the domestic market has

22

affected the level of the Japan premium. News of the Daiwa bank incident and news of
bank downgrading were also shown to have significant impact on the Japan premium.
A causal relationship between the two indicators have been analyzed by VAR.
The bank stock spread and the Japan premium both have contained important
information with regard to financial system in Japan. The joint analysis has shown
that announcements which have impact on the bank stock index increased the spread,
then increased the Japan premium.

Brewer, Genay, Hunter, and Kaufman (2000) came to our attention after we wrote the
first draft of this paper.

Monthly market valuations are taken from Statistics Monthly of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The monthly figures are adjusted for daily figures by price index changes,
assuming that the number of issued stocks do not change within that month. Any
problem with this assumption is corrected within the month.

One might ask whether divergence may be any way related to a regular business
cycle of a recession or a recovery or a cyclical movement of general stock prices, rather
than a peculiarity of the time. Hence, we will check whether movements of the two
indices in the second half of the 1990s are in any way typical or atypical in the long run
trend. Comparing monthly index of TOPIX and BINDEX from 1985 to 1999, one can
confirm that the relationship has been stable between the two indices until the
mid-1990s, over the business cycles and stock price cycles.

The LIBOR is calculated by the British Bankers’ Association as the average of the
dollar interbank offer rate. From the beginning of our sample period until January
1999, there were three Japanese banks, including the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, in the
16 banks that are samples for the LIBOR. Since highest four and lowest four banks
were eliminated from the average calculation of the LIBOR, it can be safely assumed
that the LIBOR is not influenced by the Japan premium. After January 1999, only the
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi is included in the LIBOR calculation samples, hence there is
no contamination of Japan premium in the LIBOR.

4

Alternatively, the Japan premium can be measured as the borrowing rates of
Japanese banks in London vs. the borrowing rates of western banks in London.
However, we do not have access to the data of individual banks’ borrowing costs.
Therefore, we took the TIBOR minus LIBOR. In essence, our approach produces a
premium very similar to that one by the alternative approach.

Earlier in 1998, a new law was passed to make it possible for the authorities to
nationalize a very weak bank.

Perron (1989) was the first to develop a test of structural changes in the
nonstationary series. Andrews (1993) showed a test for a case where the timing of
structural change is unknown. Quintos (1997) showed a similar test in the Error
Correction Model. Seo has extended Andrews and Quintos and made the calculation
easier.

The OLS variance of the same equation revealed heteroskedasticity-correlated

weighting matrix, initial values are obtained by 3SLS and the procedure by

If the variables have different scales it is useful to consider innovations of one
