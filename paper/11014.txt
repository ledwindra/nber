A Protectionist Bias in Majoritarian Politics
Gene M. Grossman and Elhanan Helpman
NBER Working Paper No. 11014
December 2004
JEL No. D72, F13
ABSTRACT
We develop a novel model of campaigns, elections, and policymaking in which the ex ante
objectives of national party leaders differ from the ex post objectives of elected legislators. This
generates a distinction between “policy rhetoric” and “policy reality” and introduces an important
role for “party discipline” in the policymaking process. We identify a protectionist bias in
majoritarian politics. When trade policy is chosen by the majority delegation and legislators in the
minority have limited means to influence choices, the parties announce trade policies that favor
specific factors, and the expected tariff or export subsidy is positive. Positions and expected
outcomes monotonically approach free trade as party discipline strengthens.

Introduction

In a democracy, the majority rules. Often, this means that policy choices reflect more the
preferences of some citizens than others. This feature of democracy–popularly known as
“tyranny of the majority”–arises in institutional settings in which elected oﬃcials represent
disproportionately the interests of their own constituents and electees who represent the
minority have limited means to influence policy.
In this paper, we argue that tyranny of the majority imparts a protectionist bias to
democratic politics. This is so even when the average citizen covets free trade and when
every citizen has an equal probability of being represented in the policymaking process. By
“protection” we mean policies that favor quasi-fixed factors of production. Thus, protection
in our parlance refers both to tariﬀs that shield import-competing industries from foreign
competition and subsidies that promote exports. The bias refers to the average or expected
policy outcome.
We focus on majoritarian systems in which elected legislators represent geographic regions. The existence of a protectionist bias requires only that (i) party leaders cannot fully
commit their candidates to adopt particular policies if elected (i.e., less than perfect “party
discipline”), (ii) members of the majority delegation in the legislature give disproportionate
weight to residents of their own districts when setting policy, and (iii) members of the minority delegation cannot fully compensate those in the majority to induce a nationally eﬃcient
policy choice. We believe that these conditions are met in most, if not all, majoritarian
political systems.
To establish our point and to study the bias, we develop a novel model of parties, elections,
and legislative policymaking. In our model, we distinguish between the objectives of political
parties and those of individual politicians. The national parties aim to capture a majority
of the seats in the legislature so as to be able to pursue their ideological agendas. An
elected representative seeks to maximize her own political fortune, which requires attention
both to the interests of her constituents and to her relationship with her national party. The
parties move first by announcing positions or “platforms.” These announcements influence the
subsequent elections and legislative deliberations but do not fully bind the elected politicians.
After the platforms are announced, the heterogeneous voters in each district elect a single
representative to the national legislature. Each voter casts his ballot to maximize his expected
utility in anticipation of the prospective actions of the elected body (which will depend on its
composition) and in the face of uncertainty about electoral outcomes in districts other than
his own. Finally, after the election takes place, the legislators in the majority delegation set
policy to maximize their joint political welfare, which reflects both the well-being of their
constituents and the political costs that might ensue from any breakdown of party discipline.
Our model thus incorporates a distinction between “policy rhetoric” (that which is announced
1

by the parties as their legislative intentions) and “policy reality” (that which is enacted by
the elected legislative body).
We show in this context that a protectionist bias results whenever districts diﬀer in
their ownership shares of the industry-specific factors, industry outputs respond positively
to prices, and party discipline is less than perfect. We go on to investigate the determinants
of the size of the bias, one important element of which is the degree of party discipline
embodied in a nation’s political institutions. As we shall see, the geographic distribution of
the industry-specific factors also plays a central role.
Our paper fits well into the burgeoning literature on the comparative politics of economic
policy, a literature that links political institutions to economic policy outcomes. For example,
Persson et al. (2000) compare redistributive policies in presidential versus parliamentary
systems, while Milesi-Ferretti et al. (2002) study transfer payments and provision of local
public goods under diﬀerent voting rules. In this paper and in a companion piece on the
provision of public goods (Grossman and Helpman, 2005), we introduce the extent of party
discipline as a distinct institutional feature of the political system. While we do not model
the instruments of party discipline explicitly, nor a party’s choice of how much discipline to
impose in a particular political environment, we do parameterize in a natural way the degree
of discipline and allow for continuous variation in this parameter, not just full discipline or
none.1 Our measure of discipline captures the (political) cost to individual politicians of
deviating from their party’s announced policy target.
The organization and main findings of the paper are as follows. In the next section,
we highlight our core argument. We abstract from electoral competition and optimizing
behavior by parties, and simply assume that the legislator from each geographic district is a
member of either of two political parties with equal probability. When the legislature operates
by majority rule and neglects minority interests, the expected tariﬀ is always non-negative
and is positive when outputs respond positively to price and districts diﬀer in their capital
ownership. We argue that the protectionist bias reflects the convexity of the profit function
and the lack of policy pre-commitment.
In Section 3, we develop our more complete model of the electoral-cum-policymaking
process. The model includes three stages of policy announcement, district voting, and legislative deliberations. We solve for a sub-game perfect equilibrium and show, in Section 4,
that a protectionist bias arises in both the rhetoric and reality of trade policy. Specifically,
1

McGillivray and Smith (1997) have studied trade policy formation in a plurality system with either high
or low party discipline. They treat trade policy as a dichotomous variable (either ‘protectionist’ or ‘free
trade’) and specify a diﬀerent election-cum-policy game form depending on the degree of party discipline.
Their main conclusion is that industries with broad geographic reach fare better in a system with low party
discipline, while those concentrated in marginal districts fare better in a system with high party discipline.
(See also McGillivray (1997, 2004)). While their paper shares some related concerns, their model and focus is
quite diﬀerent from ours.

each party announces a vector of non-negative tariﬀs (or export subsidies) as its platform
and the random electoral process gives rise to a non-negative average tariﬀs. Both the announced positions and the expected tariﬀs are strictly positive when party discipline is less
than perfect, output responds positively to price, and districts are not identical in their
capital ownership.
In Section 5, we discuss economic and political determinants of the size of the bias. We
show that both tariﬀ announcements and expected tariﬀs are declining in a parameter that
reflects the extent of party discipline but increasing in the disparity in ownership shares of any
two districts, given the ownership share of the third. We also discuss the relationship between
protection and the responsiveness of supply and demand to price. Section 6 concludes.

The Core Argument

In this section, we explain how majoritarian politics can give rise to a protectionist bias in
the trade policies of a small, open economy. We seek to lay bare the core of the argument
in its simplest form. To this end, we abstract from electoral competition and the optimizing
behavior of political parties. We focus instead on the policy choices of a legislature of
exogenous (and random) composition, with legislators representing districts with disparate
interests. Once the core argument is clear, it will be easier to understand the properties of
our complete model, which captures complex interactions between parties, voters, and elected
representatives.
Consider a small country populated by a unit measure of citizens that has one third of the
population living in each of three geographically distinct districts. Individuals consume four
P
goods, labelled 1,2,3, and y. Each individual has quasi-linear utility cy + 3g=1 u (cg ), where
cy is consumption of good y and u (·) is an increasing and concave function of consumption
cg of good g, g ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Assuming that every individual consumes some positive amount
of good y, we write the indirect utility for individual i residing in district j as
Vij = Iij +

3
X

S(pg ) ,

(1)

g=1

where Iij is the individual’s income net of lump-sum taxes and transfers, S(pg ) is consumer
surplus from consumption of good g, and pg is the domestic price of that good. The price pg
of good g is the sum of the given international price p∗ (the same for goods 1, 2, and 3) and
the specific import tariﬀ or export subsidy tg , where tg < 0 represents an import subsidy or
export tax. Note that −S 0 (pg ) = c(pg ) is the demand for good g, as usual.
The numeraire good y is produced with one unit of labor per unit of output. We assume
that the country produces a strictly positive quantity of this good in equilibrium, which fixes

3

the wage rate at one.2 Each good g ∈ {1, 2, 3} is produced with labor and an industryspecific factor that we call “capital.” The return to each type of capital is an increasing and
(weakly) convex function Π(pg ) of the domestic price. The slopes of the profit functions give
the competitive supply functions, xg = x(pg ).
We wish to make the districts symmetric both economically and politically, so as not to
bias the political process in favor of any one district or group of citizens. To this end, we
assume that the districts are symmetric in their ownership shares of capital, in the sense
that residents of each district own a large share of the capital in one industry, a medium
share in a second industry, and a small share in a third industry. In particular, let α1 , α2 ,
P
and α3 be three fractions with the property that α1 ≥ α2 ≥ α3 ≥ 0 and 3j=1 αj = 1. Let
αjg be the fraction of the capital in industry g owned by residents of district j. Then, we
impose symmetry by assuming that α11 = α22 = α33 = α1 , α21 = α32 = α13 = α2 , and
α31 = α12 = α23 = α3 .3
With this ownership structure, the aggregate income of district j is

(2)

where m(pg ) = c(pg ) − x(pg ) is imports (possibly negative) of good g, and thus the three
terms in (2) represent labor income, capital income, and rebated tariﬀ revenue, respectively.
It follows from (1) and (2) that the aggregate welfare of residents of district j is

(3)

Suppose that each district is represented by a single legislator, who might be a member of
either party A or party B. For now, we do not specify how these legislators were elected, nor
do we ascribe any trade policy positions to either political party. Rather, we simply assume
a probability of one half that the representative of district j is a member of party K for
j ∈ {1, 2, 3} and K ∈ {A, B}, with independence across districts. Members of the same party
can compensate one another with political side payments or intertemporal trades, so that
any delegation from a given party will seek to maximize the representatives’ joint welfare.
In contrast, members of diﬀerent parties have no reliable means to eﬀect transfers, so that
2

Positive production of good y requires a suﬃciently large labor supply relative to the derived demand for
labor by producers of goods 1, 2, and 3 at the prevailing equilibrium prices.
3
Once we impose symmetry in the distributions of ownership shares, we can label the districts and goods
so that these assignments of shares are without further loss of generality. That is, we first pick any district
and call it district 1. Then we find the good for which district 1 has the largest share of capital and call that
good 1. Next we identify the district that has the second largest share of capital in industry 1 and call that
district 2. We find the good for which district 2 has the largest share and label that good 2. Finally, we
designate the remaining district as district 3 and the remaining good as good 3.

4

a legislator in the minority delegation cannot influence the policy decision.4 This captures
in extreme the tyranny of the majority. Finally, suppose that each legislator represents the
economic interests of her average constituent.5
The delegation of the majority party may have either two or three members. If the legislators in all three districts happen to be members of the same political party–which happens
with probability one quarter–they will select the vector of trade policies that maximizes
V1 + V2 + V3 . Since this maximand is aggregate welfare and the country is small, they will
opt for free trade in this situation. We record this observation as
t{1,2,3} = 0 ,

(4)

where tL denotes the policy vector enacted by a delegation that includes representatives of
the set of districts L, where tL = (tL,1 , tL,2 , tL,3 ) and tL,g is the tariﬀ applied to good g.
Next suppose that the representatives of districts j and k are members of one political
party while the representative of district is a member of the other. For every combination
of j, k and (no two the same), this happens with probability one quarter. In the event, the
majority delegation chooses the trade policy to maximize Vj + Vk , or

for all g.

That is, the marginal benefit of a trade tax on good g to residents of districts j and k matches
its marginal cost. The marginal benefit is proportional to the districts’ joint output of good
g, and is positive or negative according to whether the residents of districts j and k together
own more or less than the average national per capita share of the capital in the industry.
The marginal cost reflects the familiar deadweight loss from protection.
To make the arguments more transparent, we henceforth adopt linear forms for the supply
4

Dixit et al. (2000) show how political compromise can arise from tacit cooperation in an infinitely repeated
policy game even if the transfers across parties are impossible at a point in time. We do not consider the
possibility of such cooperation here, relying for justification perhaps on the finite political lives of the legislators.
5
Willmann (2004) shows that voters in heterogeneous districts may have incentives to nominate and elect
delegates to a national legislature who represent the interests of those who own more than the district average
amount of sector-specific capital. Such strategic delegation to extremists can benefit the district in legislative
deliberations. The protectionist bias that we identify does not require that legislators are more extreme than
their constituents and it would only be strengthened if this were the case.

where is the district excluded from the majority delegation. We see from (7) that the
majority provides positive protection for industry g if and only if the residents of districts j
and k together own more than two thirds of the nation’s capital in this industry (i.e., if the
excluded district owns less than one third of the capital). Otherwise, the majority sets a
negative tariﬀ or export subsidy for industry g.
When the three districts do not own exactly equal shares of all types of capital (i.e., when
α 6= 1/3 for some ), a majority of any two legislators sets at least one tariﬀ that is positive
and at least one tariﬀ that is negative. The question we now ask is whether the average rate
of protection is positive or negative when the majority delegation includes the representatives
of districts j and k but not . Equation (7) implies that the average tariﬀ is7

Note that the average does not depend on which two districts are included in the majority;
this is a direct consequence of our assumption of symmetric ownership shares. Moreover,
equation (8) implies that t̄{j,k} ≥ 0 and t̄{j,k} > 0 whenever γ 6= 0 and α 6= 1/3 for some .8
We also observe that the expected rate of protection is non-negative in every industry (and
positive whenever γ 6= 0 and α 6= 1/3 for some ), where the expectation is formed prior

With linear supply and demand functions, the second-order condition for maximizing Vj + Vk always is
satisfied.

to the election and thus reflects an equal probability of each possible legislative majority.
The expected protection for industry g is E[tL,g ] = 3t̄{j,k} /4, because a majority delegation
with three members that chooses t{1,2,3},g = 0 arises with probability 1/4, while a delegation
with two members that chooses t{j,k},g also arises with probability 1/4, for each of the three
possible combinations of j and k.
Why the bias in the average protection? Clearly, it derives from the convexity of the
profit function, as well as features of the assumed policymaking process. The convexity of
profits implies that the marginal benefit of protection increases with tg when tg is positive,
but decreases with minus tg when tg is negative. As a consequence, the positive tariﬀs that
emerge when the majority favors protection are larger on average than the import subsidies
that emerge when the opposite is true. The key assumptions about policymaking that are
needed for the result are that (i) candidates and parties cannot fully commit to policies
prior to the election and (ii) legislators in the minority delegation cannot fully compensate
those in the majority to ensure that their constituents’ interests receive equal weight. If
prior commitment were possible, the candidates in each party would announce the vector t
to maximize their constituents’ expected welfare. The choice for each party would be free
trade. And if the minority legislators could make lump-sum transfers to the majority in the
ex post deliberations, again the welfare maximizing choice would be free trade in all possible
legislatures.
In the next section, we develop a more complete model of the political process. The
model includes political parties that choose platforms, voters that maximize expected utility,
and legislators who set policy. A parameter of the model represents the extent to which the
parties can bind the ex post behavior of their geographically-minded politicians. We shall
find that a protectionist bias exists whenever party discipline is less than perfect. We will
then be in a position to investigate the determinants of the size of the protectionist bias.

Platforms, Elections, and Legislative Action

We study a majoritarian system with three geographic districts, two political parties, and a
continuum of voters. The districts are distinguished by their capital ownership shares. The
parties are distinguished by their ideologies and other exogenous characteristics. Voters diﬀer
in their ideological preferences and in their capital ownership.
The political game has three stages. In the first stage, the parties choose platforms τ A
¢
¡
K K is a vector, with τ K
and τ B , which they announce to the electorate. τ K = τ K
g
1 , τ2 , τ2
representing the announced rate of protection in sector g. As before, τ K
>
0
represents
a
g
(specific) import tax or export subsidy, while τ K
g < 0 represents an import subsidy or export
tax. The party leaders seek to maximize the probability that their own national party will
capture a majority of the seats in the legislature.
7

Next come the district elections. Each district elects a single representative to the threemember legislature. The heterogeneous citizens in a district care about trade policy and
about other (fixed) characteristics of the party that is elected. An individual in district j
votes for the candidate from party A if and only if, given the probability distribution of
electoral outcomes in districts k and , his expected utility is higher when the candidate from
this party wins in district j than when the candidate from party B wins in his district.
Finally, the legislature sets the trade policy. The majority delegation chooses the tariﬀ
rates that maximize aggregate welfare of residents of the districts they represent net of any
penalties they will suﬀer by deviating from their party’s platform. The maximization of
constituents’ welfare can be justified on the basis that this furthers their subsequent (but
unmodeled) electoral prospects, or because these are “citizen-candidates” (as in Besley and
Coate (1997) or Osborne and Slivinski (1996)) who share the trade policy preferences of their
fellow district residents. We discuss the penalties further below.
We seek a subgame perfect equilibrium of the three-stage political game. In such an equilibrium, the voters correctly anticipate the influence that the platform announcements will
have on the policies that emerge from the legislature and the parties correctly anticipate how
their announcements will aﬀect voting behavior. As usual, we solve the game “backwards”,
by first considering the legislative deliberations, then the voting, and finally the platform
choices.

3.1

Policy Formation

By the time the legislature convenes to set trade policy, the parties will have announced
platforms τ A and τ B and the voters will have elected some party K to a majority position
comprising the set of districts L. We assume that the majority delegation sets the trade
policy vector, which we denote by tK
L , to maximize the aggregate welfare of residents of the
districts in L net of any penalty they suﬀer for deviating from their party’s announcement
τ K . We discuss each component in turn.
Citizen i in district j realizes utility
K
K
WijK = Vij (tK
L ) + µij + ν j

(9)

when party K wins a majority comprising the set of districts L and sets the trade policy tK
L.
In (9), Vij is a utility component from the economic policy that derives from the quasi-linear
K
preferences given in (1), while µK
ij and ν j are components that derive from the individual’s
evaluation of the ideological positions and other characteristics of political party K (the
former idiosyncratic, the latter common to all residents of district j). The production technologies are the same as before; i.e., good y is produced with labor alone, while good g is
produced with labor and capital, for g = 1, 2, 3. We assume for expositional simplicity that
8

every resident of district j owns the same amount of capital.9 Then

where 3αjg is the per capita ownership share in district j of the capital of industry g. Again,
we assume that ownership shares are symmetric across districts, so that each district owns
a fraction α1 of the capital in one industry, a fraction α2 of the capital in another, and a
fraction α3 of the capital in a third.
The penalty for deviating from τ K represents the national party’s ability and willingness
P
K 2
to enforce “party discipline.” We assume that party K levies a “fine” of 12 δ 3g=1 (tK
L,g − τ g )
in units of political welfare when a majority delegation from party K chooses the policy tK
L
instead of the party’s previously announced platform, τ K . The fine is borne by the elected
legislators from party K and represents a counterweight to their goal of serving their local
constituents. We do not model the instruments that the party uses to impose the penalty,
nor can we capture in our static model the reasons why the party carries out the punishment
ex post. Rather, we take δ as a reduced-form measure of the institutional environment.10 If,
for example, δ = 0, the legislative majority can set the trade policy with complete impunity,
as in the citizen-candidate models of Besley and Coate (1997) and Osborne and Slivinski
(1996). At the opposite extreme, if δ → ∞ the legislators cannot aﬀord to deviate at all from
the party’s announcement, as in Downsian models with policy commitment.

Our results would be exactly the same if residents of a district were heterogeneous in their capital endowments provided that the distribution of ownership shares were independent of the distribution of ideological
preferences.
10
We imagine, for example, that δ will be larger the greater is the national party’s control over campaign
finances in regional elections. Similarly, δ might be large if the national party exercises firm control over the
allocation of committee posts and patronage positions. See Snyder and Groseclose (2000) and McCarty et al.
(2001) for attempts to measure how party discipline in the U.S. Congress has varied over time. Note, however,
that these authors define party discipline somewhat diﬀerently than we do. Whereas we define discipline as
adherence to previously-announced positions of the national parties, they examine whether "backbenchers"
in the legislature vote as a block with legislative party leaders. Clearly, these two manifestations of discipline
are related but not the same.

From (11) we see that a majority delegation comprising representatives of all three districts does not choose free trade unless either the party’s platform is one of free trade or δ = 0.
Although free trade maximizes aggregate welfare, the legislators may choose a diﬀerent trade
policy to temper the response by their national party. In fact, since the aggregate welfare
cost of a small deviation from free trade is small, a legislature of the whole will always move
some way in the direction of the party’s platform unless discipline is totally absent.
When the majority party holds seats in only two districts, the resulting policy reflects
both the capital holdings of the citizens in these districts and the prior party announcement.
The majority delegation sets a positive tariﬀ on imports of good g whenever their party
has advocated protection and the residents of the districts in the majority together own at
least two thirds of the capital in that industry. The tariﬀ tK
{j,k},g may be positive even when
αjg + αkg < 2/3 if party K’s platform calls for protection of industry g and party discipline
is suﬃciently strong.

3.2

The Elections

We turn to the second stage, when the voters cast their ballots in anticipation of the policy
choices that will result from the diﬀerent possible legislatures. A voter in district j cannot

average (and median) voter in each district has no political leanings toward one party or the
other, given the values of the district shocks and apart from the voter’s assessment of any
diﬀerences in the trade platforms. The inverse of the parameter h measures the diversity of
political opinions within a district. The random variable ν j is a popularity or “valence” shock
that aﬀects the relative evaluations of the two parties similarly for all residents of district
j. Each resident knows the value of ν j by the time he enters the voting booth, but not the
values of ν k and ν . The popularity shocks are distributed independently across districts;
each has a cumulative distribution function F (ν), with F (0) = 1/2 and a density function
that is positive at v = 0 and symmetric about this point. Thus, the mean popularity shock
favors neither political party.
Voter i in district j evaluates his expected utility conditional on a local victory by each
candidate, recognizing his uncertainty about the election outcome in the other two districts.

Considering the uniform distribution of µij , the fraction of votes that party A will capture
in district j (as a function of ν j ) is given by sj = 1/2+h(∆j /θj −ν j ) and the probability that
sj > 1/2 is the probability that ν j < ∆j /θj . But ν j has the cumulative distribution F (·).

the announced platforms, τ A and τ B .12

3.3

The Campaign

We turn to the first stage, when the parties announce their tariﬀ platforms. At this stage,
they do not know the values of the popularity shocks. The leaders of each party choose
their platform to maximize the probability that they will capture a majority of the seats in
the legislature. Party A wins a majority if it wins in any two districts or in all three. The
probability of a victory by party A thus equals
ρ = ρ1 ρ2 (1 − ρ3 ) + ρ1 (1 − ρ2 )ρ3 + (1 − ρ1 )ρ2 ρ3 + ρ1 ρ2 ρ3 .
The leaders of party B aim to minimize ρ, or to maximize 1 − ρ. We seek a Nash equilibrium
of this zero-sum game.
Recall that the voters’ economic interests are independent of their party loyalties. Thus,
the parties have similar incentives in regard to trade policy. Moreover, we have introduced
no bias in the parties’ ideological appeal (µij is symmetrically distributed with mean zero
in every district) and no bias in the popularity shocks (ν j is symmetrically distributed with
12

The equations (10)-(14) always have a solution with ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ3 = 0 and one with ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ3 = 1.
If a voter in district j expects either party to win with certainty in the other two districts, it is a dominant
strategy for him to vote for this same party irrespective of the parties’ tariﬀ platforms and his own political
leanings. This is because the election in his own district cannot aﬀect the determination of the majority party,
but only whether district j will be included or excluded from the policymaking process. In the equilibria we
have just described, every citizen in the country votes for the same party. Such equilibria arise only with
extreme coordination of expections. For this reason, we do not consider them any further.

mean zero in every district). It is thus reasonable to look for an equilibrium in which the
parties announce the same trade platforms (τ A = τ B ), oﬀer the same economic welfare to a
given district (∆j = 0 for all j) and achieve the same probabilities of victory (ρj = 1/2 for
all j). Furthermore, the industries look similar to the political parties prior to the elections.
Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that they announce a similar trade tax for each good;
i.e., τ K
g = τ for g = 1, 2, 3. We henceforth focus on symmetric equilibria with these properties.

can use equations (11) and (12) to calculate the responses of these tariﬀs to changes in the
party’s announcement.

this assumption, the solution to (17) would involve the announcement and enactment of an infinite tariﬀ for
some finite values of δ, which would not be consistent with our assumption that demand is linear and the
requirement that consumption is non-negative.

This expression for τ gives the parties’ common equilibrium tariﬀ announcement as a function
of the parameters of the model: {αj }, β, γ, and δ.15 Then we can substitute τ into (11)
and (12) to solve for the actual tariﬀ rates for the various possible election results. In what
follows we assume that the parameter values obey Assumption 1 and that F 0 (0) is suﬃciently
small that the second-order conditions are satisfied.

Equilibrium Platforms and Policies

In this section, we use equations (11), (12) and (17) to characterize the equilibrium platforms
and policies. In so doing, we establish a protectionist bias in both the rhetoric and reality of
trade policy.

4.1

The Rhetoric of Trade Policy

We focus first on the parties’ announcements. We prove16
Proposition 1 Let τ = (τ , τ , τ ) be the equilibrium platform in a symmetric equilibrium. (i)
For δ > 0, if γ = 0 or αj = 1/3 for all j, then τ = 0. Otherwise τ > 0. (ii) limδ→∞ τ = 0.
Proposition 1 establishes the existence of a protectionist bias in the parties’ platforms.
The parties never promise import subsidies or export taxes. Moreover, they promise free
trade only if the districts are homogeneous in their capital ownership shares (and thus their
trade policy preferences) or if the supplies of the non-numeraire goods are unresponsive to
price. For all finite β and δ, if γ is positive and finite and not all ownership shares are the
same, the parties announce positive import tariﬀs or export subsidies.
The conditions for a positive bias are the same as in Section 2. A bias arises when
the districts are heterogeneous, the profit functions are convex, and the parties are unable
15

We have not been able to examine the second-order conditions for a party’s best response to its rival’s
equilibrium platform using analytical methods; the resulting expressions are too complex. For this reason,
we have computed a set of numerical examples and have examined the conditions under which the platform
in (17) describes a best response to a similar announcement by the rival party. We find that Assumption 1
together with an assumption that F 0 (0) is suﬃciently small ensure the existence of the symmetric equilibrium
described by (17). When F 0 (0) is large, however, the second-order conditions for the best response by party
A to party B’s platform are violated at (17).
16
All proofs are in the appendix.

14

to pre-commit to policy. If α1 = α2 = α3 = 1/3, there is no scope for trade policy to
redistribute income. In such circumstances, trade policies impose deadweight without oﬀering
any compensating benefits, and so voters in every district covet free trade. Then the parties
have no reason to promise anything else. If γ = 0, industry rents are linear in price. Then
the marginal gains to those who benefit from increased protection when tariﬀs are positive
are similar to the marginal gains to those who benefit from decreased protection when tariﬀs
are negative. In the event, the parties find no reason to deviate from a free-trade rhetoric in
one direction or the other. Finally, as δ approaches infinity, the announcements converge on
free trade. A very high value of δ allows the parties virtually to commit to a trade policy.
As in Lindbeck and Weibull (1987), the optimal commitment is to a policy that maximizes
average welfare, which is free trade.

4.2

The Reality of Trade Policy

Next we examine the policies that emerge from diﬀerent compositions of the legislature.
When the majority party captures three seats, equation (11) implies that t{1,2,3},g = t̄{1,2,3}
for g ∈ {1, 2, 3} and that

(19)

where τ again is the equilibrium platform given in (17). Note that the average t̄{j,k} does not
depend on which districts j and k are represented in the majority. We organize our discussion
around
Proposition 2 (i) If α = 1/3 for all , then tL,g = 0 for all L and g. (ii) limδ→∞ tL,g = 0
for all L and g. (iii) For δ > 0, if γ = 0 or α = 1/3 for all , then t̄L = 0 for all L and
E[tL,g ] = 0 for all g. Otherwise t̄L > 0 for all L and E[tL,g ] > 0 for all g.
Part (i) of Proposition 2 states that, when the districts are homogeneous in their capital
ownership shares, free trade prevails in all industries no matter what the electoral outcome.
This follows from the fact that each party announces a platform of free trade and no elected
oﬃcials have any reason to depart from these promises. For example, when the legislature has
two members in the majority delegation, the representatives will escape penalties by enacting
free trade, and will also maximize the welfare of their constituents (which amounts to two

15

thirds of aggregate welfare). If all three legislators belong to the same party, again a policy
of free trade avoids penalties and maximizes constituents’ welfare.
Free trade also prevails in the limit as party discipline becomes perfect. As δ approaches
infinity, the parties maximize their prospects of victory by appealing to the average voter
(see Proposition 1(ii)). And once they have promised free trade, the elected representatives
will find it too costly to stray from these announcements.
Now consider the trade policies that result when one party wins the election in all three
districts and ownership shares are not all the same. Suppose the supply curves for goods
1, 2, and 3 slope upward. The residents of the three districts comprise the entirety of the
country, so free trade in every good would maximize their collective welfare. But, we know
from Proposition 1 that their party leaders will have promised positive protection for every
industry. As long as δ > 0, the legislators will sacrifice some goodwill among voters to
appease their party leaders. Equation (11) tells us that τ > 0 implies t{1,2,3},g > 0 for all
finite and positive β, γ, and δ.
What happens when the majority party wins in only two districts (say, 1 and 2) and
ownership shares are not all the same? Consider the trade policy for industry 1, in which
residents of districts 1 and 2 collectively own more than two thirds of the national capital
stock. Then, even if γ = 0 and the parties have announced free trade, the legislature will set a
positive tariﬀ; i.e., t{1,2},1 > 0. Here, the penalty to the legislators for small departures from
the announcement are small while the constituent gains from protection are large. And if
γ 6= 0 so that τ > 0, both the dictates of party discipline and constituents’ interests point to a
positive tariﬀ. The actual protection for industry 1 may exceed or fall short of the campaign
promise, depending on the extent of party discipline. Indeed, we find that t{1,2},1 < τ if δ is
suﬃciently small, but t{1,2},1 > τ if δ is suﬃciently large.17
Now consider the tariﬀ on good 3. Recall that α13 + α23 = α2 + α3 < 2/3. Then
t{1,2},3 may be either positive or negative. Assuredly, an import subsidy (or export tax)
for good 3 serves the interests of the represented citizens. But the majority party will have
promised a positive tariﬀ for this industry, just as for the others. The elected representatives
must weigh the costs of disappointing their constituents against those of deviating from their
party’s position. It is not diﬃcult to generate examples in which t{1,2},3 > 0 even though the
α13 + α23 is small. It is even possible for t{1,2},3 > 0 when α23 + α23 = 0; i.e., when residents
17

Using (12) and (17), it is easy to check that the sign of t{1,2},1 − τ is opposite to that of

But (17) implies that τ → ∞ as δ → 0 and τ → 0 as δ → ∞. Moreover, we show in the appendix that τ is
declining in δ. Together this establishes that t{1,2},1 > τ for δ large, and t{1,2},1 < τ for δ small.

16

of the districts in the majority own no capital at all in industry 3.18 In such circumstances,
the protectionist bias in the announcement induces positive protection for all industries and
all electoral outcomes.
But even in circumstances when protection for some industries can be negative, a protectionist bias remains. As part (iii) of Proposition 2 indicates, the average tariﬀ can never
be negative, and must be positive for any legislative majority so long as ownership shares
are not all the same and supply curves slope upward. Also, the expected tariﬀ on any good
is positive under these circumstances, where the expectation is formed prior to the election.
The protectionist bias in the average trade policy and the expected tariﬀ for a given industry
mirrors the bias in the equilibrium platform.

5

The Size of the Bias

In this section, we examine the political and economic determinants of the parties’ equilibrium
platforms and the legislature’s policy choices. We focus especially on party discipline and the
geographic distribution of the capital stock, but also discuss briefly the slopes of the demand
and supply functions.
As we have noted, the parameter δ in our model captures the degree of party discipline.
It measures the cost to individual legislators of deviating from the policy advocated by party
leaders. While our static model does not allow endogenous determination of the size of δ, we
imagine that it reflects institutional features of the political landscape, such as the party role
in campaign financing and in the distribution of the perquisites of political oﬃce.
In the appendix, we prove19
Proposition 3 Suppose γ > 0 and α 6= 1/3 for some . Then: (i) For finite δ > 0,
∂τ /∂δ < 0 and ∂E[tL,g ]/∂δ < 0 for all g. (ii) limδ→0 τ = ∞ but limδ→0 tL,g < ∞ for all L
and g. (iii) limδ→∞ τ = 0 and limδ→∞ tL,g = 0 for all L and g.
The proposition states that the protectionist bias declines monotonically with the severity
of party discipline. When δ is very small, the political rhetoric is shrill. The party leaders
have very limited means to bind the ex post behavior of the elected representatives, so they
attempt to do what they can by announcing extreme positions. But the announcements are
largely ignored by the representatives who bear relatively little political cost from doing so.
The actual tariﬀs remain finite even as the platforms tend to infinity. Still, the expected
tariﬀ on each good is higher as δ approaches zero than for any positive value of δ.
18

This happens, for example, when β = 1, γ = 1, and δ = 1. Then, if α2 = α3 = 0, τ = 0.83 and
t{1,2},3 = 0.06.
19
Part (iii) of this proposition is just a restatement of elements of Propositions 1 and 2 and is repeated here
only for completeness.

Figure 1: Negative protection for some industries
In Figure 1, we show the relationship between the equilibrium platforms and policies and
our measure of party discipline for one set of parameter values. In drawing the figure, we
have assumed that, for each industry g, all capital is owned by residents of a single district
(i.e., α1 = 1; α2 = α3 = 0) and that β = 2, γ = 1, and x∗ = 1. The top panel in the figure
shows that, for these parameter values, the tariﬀ on good 1 is positive whenever district 1
is included in the majority delegation (i.e., t{1,2,3},1 > 0 and t{1,2},1 = t{1,3},1 > 0) but the
tariﬀ on good 1 is negative when the representative of district 1 is in the minority party
(i.e., t{2,3},1 < 0). The policy outcomes are most extreme when party discipline is totally
lacking and converge to free trade as discipline becomes perfect. The bottom panel shows
the equilibrium platform and the expected tariﬀ for industry 1, both of which are positive
and monotonically decreasing, as is generally the case.
Figure 2 depicts another possibility.20 Here the parameter values are the same as for
Figure 1, except that the supply functions are flatter (γ = 2 instead of γ = 1). Now the tariﬀ
on good 1 is positive no matter what the electoral outcome, although smallest (for given δ)
20

Still another possibility is that the actual tariﬀ on a good is positive only when the two districts with the
largest capital shares are both included in the majority delegation. For example, when β = 2, γ = 1, x∗ = 1,
and α1 = 0.4, α2 = 0.4, and α3 = 0.2, t{1,2},1 > 0 and t{1,2,3},g > 0 for all finite δ, but t{1,2},2 = t{1,2},3 < 0
for all finite δ.

18

when the representative of district 1 is not a member of the majority delegation. Again the
tariﬀ levels, and also the platform and the expected tariﬀs, converge monotonically to zero.
We turn next to the distribution of the capital stock. If the districts are homogeneous
in their capital ownerships (and hence their industrial structures), tariﬀs cannot be used to
redistribute income and their is no political gain to be had from protection. The more uneven
the distribution, the greater is the scope for tyranny of the majority. This suggests loosely
that the protectionist bias may grow with a spread in ownership shares. In fact, we have

The proposition has the following implication. Fix any one of the capital ownership
parameters, say α3 . Suppose α1 > α2 . Now let α1 grow. Then α2 shrinks by the same
amount, because the two must sum to 1−α3 . Part (i) states that this spread of the distribution
of capital ownership results in a more protectionist policy announcement. Part (ii) says the
spread in ownership shares increases the average tariﬀ for any electoral outcome. Part (iii)
states that the expected protection of every industry also rises. Evidently, the protectionist
bias is most severe when the ownership of each industry is concentrated in a single district.

Figure 3: Platform rises and declines with γ
Finally, consider the slopes of the demand and supply curves. As β rises, the marginal
deadweight loss associated with any movement away from free trade grows. From (11) and
(12) it is clear that the elected representatives will choose a smaller deviation from free trade
in every industry for given τ the larger is β. It stands to reason that the announcement will
involve less of a protectionist bias, too, because there is less political appeal of using tariﬀs to
redistributive income when the excess burden is large. Indeed, we have found ∂τ /∂β < 0 in
all of our (many) numerical examples, although we have been unable to prove an analytical
result. We do know, however, that limβ→∞ τ = 0, as is apparent from equation (17). If
∂τ /∂β < 0, it follows that all positive tariﬀ rates are monotonically decreasing in β, while
the negative rates may increase monotonically or fall first and then rise. In any case, all
tariﬀs approach zero as β grows large.
In contrast to an increase in β, an increase in the responsiveness of output to price has
oﬀsetting political implications. On the one hand, an increase in γ exacerbates the marginal
deadweight loss associated with any movement of the trade policy variable away from free
trade. On the other hand, trade policy becomes a more eﬀective redistributive tool as γ
grows larger. We find that a change in γ holding x∗ constant has an ambiguous eﬀect on the
tariﬀ announcement.21 For example, Figure 3 depicts the relationship between the platform
and γ when β = 0, δ = 10, x∗ = 100 and α1 = 0.4, α2 = 0.3 and α3 = 0.3. Clearly, the
announcement becomes more protectionist with γ when γ is small, but it tends toward free
trade when γ is large. Even if the announced τ falls monotonically to zero–as it does for
An increase in γ with x∗ constant corresponds to a rotation of the supply curve around the free-trade
production level.

many parameter values–the realized tariﬀs may display a non-monotonic relationship to the
supply responsiveness. It is even possible that a majority delegation representing the two
districts with the smallest ownership shares in an industry will set a negative tariﬀ for that
good if γ is small but a positive tariﬀ if γ is large, such that the tariﬀ rises, then falls, then
asymptotes to zero, as γ ranges from zero to infinity.22

Conclusions

We have developed a novel model of campaigns, elections, and the policymaking process.
In our model, national political parties aim to maximize their probability of controlling the
legislature, while elected legislators seek to serve the interests of voters in their own districts.
The parties announce policy platforms as in a Downsian world, but these do not fully commit
the elected representatives. The legislators can deviate from their parties’ position in order
to serve their constituents, but they pay a political cost that varies with the size of any such
deviation. Thus, the model distinguishes “policy rhetoric” from “policy reality.”
When we apply the model to trade policy formation, we find a protectionist bias in the
equilibrium outcome of majoritarian systems. We define protection as a policy that raises
the domestic price of a tradeable good above the international price level. Thus, protection
involves positive import tariﬀs or export subsidies. We find that announced trade policies
always involve non-negative tariﬀs or export subsidies, and that the random electoral process
yields an expected policy with similar properties. Both positions and expected outcomes
involve positive protection whenever output responds positively to price, districts diﬀer in
their ownership shares of the industry-specific capital stocks and party discipline is less than
perfect. The protectionist bias reflects the convexity of industry profits as a function of price,
and it arises whenever national parties cannot pre-commit to a policy and when the majority
delegation does not fully incorporate the preferences of the minority in its policy deliberations.
The protectionist bias is larger the more unequal the distribution of industry-specific capital
stocks. Under these circumstances one expects a smaller protectionist bias in countries with
better capital markets, which allow individuals to better diversify asset holdings and thereby
reduce their exposure to electoral risks.
Our analysis provides yet another demonstration of the importance of political institutions
for economic policy outcomes. We have focused here on diﬀerences in “party discipline,”
which we associate with the size of penalties that a national party can impose on individual
legislators if the latter choose to deviate from the parties’ announced positions when they are
in a position to set policy. We do not model the instruments of party discipline, but rather
treat this institutional feature of the political system parametrically. A strengthening of party
22

This is true, for example, when β = 2, δ = 1, α1 = 0.65, α2 = 0.35, and α3 = 0.05.

discipline causes both the tariﬀ (or export subsidy) announcements and the expected tariﬀ
outcome to converge toward free trade. Thus, among countries with majoritarian electoral
systems, we would expected on average to find outcomes closer to free trade in those with
institutions that impose greater party discipline.
Our paper joins a very small literature on the comparative politics of trade policy. We
hope that future research by us and others will elaborate on the determinants of party discipline, and introduce other important diﬀerences in political institutions, such as between
presidential and parliamentary regimes and between systems with majoritarian elections versus some form of proportional representation. If, for example, one takes the view that proportional representation leads to the election of legislators who maximize aggregate welfare,
because their election is not tied to particular geographic or economic interests, then our
model predicts higher average rates of protection in countries with majoritarian elections
than in countries with proportional representation.23 By introducing political features such
as these, we can gain a better understanding of cross-country diﬀerences in trade policies.

23

We believe, however, that it is necessary to model explicitly the construction of party lists in systems with
proportional representation in order to make an informed comparison between majoritarian and proportional
representation, because some procedures for constructing party lists generate biases of their own. In Israel,
for example, the lists of the large parties are determined by internal elections. As a result, those who are
selected for the party list represent disproportionately the interests of those citizens who were responsible for
their victory in the internal party election.

First-Order Conditions
We first derive equations that hold if and only if the first-order conditions (15) are satisfied.
These equations will be used to show that the equilibrium platform is given by (17). To this
end first note that we can use (13) together with (11) and (12) to derive ∆j as a function of
¡
¢
¡
¢
ρk , ρ , τ A , τ B . Denote this functional relationship as ∆j ρk , ρ , τ A , τ B . Substituting this
function into (14) gives
"

¡
¢ #
∆j ρk , ρ , τ A , τ B
ρj = F
, for j, k, diﬀerent from each other.
ρk (1 − ρ ) + ρ (1 − ρk )
B
This is the system from which we can calculate ∂ρj /∂τ A
g and ∂ρj /∂τ g . For a symmetric
equilibrium it is enough to calculate ∂ρj /∂τ A
g.
Diﬀerentiating this system of three equations with respect to the probabilities ρ1 , ρ2 , ρ3
K
and with respect to τ A
g , and evaluating the result at the symmetric equilibrium point τ g = τ
for all K and g, and ρj = 1/2 for all j, we obtain

we find that ∂∆
∂ρ1 + ∂ρ1 = 2Q (τ ). Similarly, ∂ρ + ∂ρ = 2Q (τ ), for other j, k, that are
diﬀerent from one another. This implies that 1T E = [1 − 4F 0 (0) Q (τ )] (1, 1, 1), where 1 is a
column vector of ones, and therefore 1T = (1, 1, 1). We assume that 0 < F 0 (0) < 1/4Q (τ ),
where τ is given by (17). That is, F 0 (0) is small enough, and its upper limit is a function of
the model’s parameters.24 In this event we can multiply (A1) by 1T from the left to obtain

Our simulations indicate that F 0 (0) has to be small for the symmetric equilibrium to exist. When F 0 (0)
is large, the second order conditions of the best response of party A to B’s platform are not satisfied at the
proposed symmetric equilibrium point.

Suppose not; i.e., suppose D(δ) < 0 for some positive value of δ. Assumption 1 implies
that D(0) > 0. Since D (·) is continuous in δ, it can become negative for higher values of δ
only if there exists a δ̃ > 0 such that D(δ̃) = 0 and D0 (δ̃) < 0. Let δ 0 be the smallest δ̃ for
which this is true.

Proof of Proposition 2
To prove part (i), note from part (i) of Proposition 1 that α = 1/3 for all implies τ = 0.
It is then evident from (11) and (12) that tL,g = 0 for every majority L.
Next consider part (ii). Equations (11) and (12) imply that limδ→∞ tL,g = limδ→∞ τ
for every majority L. But limδ→∞ τ = 0 according to part (ii) of Proposition 1. Therefore
limδ→∞ tL,g = 0 for all majorities L.
Finally, consider part (iii). For finite δ > 0 the equilibrium platform is τ = 0 when either
α = 1/3 for all or γ = 0, as stated in part (i) of Proposition 1. Equations (18) and (19)
then implies that t̄L = 0 for all majorities L. Moreover, if α 6= 1/3 for some and γ > 0,
then τ > 0 by part (i) of Proposition 1. In this case, (18) implies that t̄{1,2,3} > 0 while (19)

where D0 and M 0 are given in in (A4) and (A8), respectively. Therefore ∂E [tL,g ] /∂δ < 0 if

We now prove that M 0 /M −D0 /D < 0, which is suﬃcient for ∂τ /∂δ < 0 and ∂E [tL,g ] /∂δ <

It follows that C < 0, which implies M 0 /M − D0 /D < 0. This proves part (i).
For part (ii), first note that limδ→0 τ = ∞ follows directly from (17). Next note that (17)

which is finite. This result, together with (11) and (12), then imply that limδ→0 tL,g is finite
for every majority coalition L and every good g.
Finally, consider part (iii). We have shown in part (ii) of Proposition 1 that limδ→∞ τ = 0.
Using this result, it follows directly from equations (11) and (12) that limδ→∞ tL,g = 0 for all
L and g.

To prove part (i), note that–using (A3) and (A7)–we can represent (17) as
