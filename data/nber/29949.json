    "abstract": "\n\nThe covariance of asset returns with economic states of the world is a fundamental input to asset pricing models.  Using a semi-annual survey of forecasts by a panel of U.S. economists over more than 70 years, we infer forecaster beliefs about covariance between the S&P index and macro-economic factors. We find evidence that life-experience was a significant determinant of beliefs about the co-movement of inflation and stock returns\n\n",
