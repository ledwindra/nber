    "abstract": "\n\nIn this article we examine the Equity Premium in the Indian context and review the related literature.  The equity premium is the returned earned by a well-diversified stock portfolio in excess of that earned by a risk free security such as a Treasury Bill. Consistent with U.S. experience we find that the Indian equity premium has been quite high in the post 1991 period, averaging 9.7% above the corresponding risk free security.  It is difficult to justify such a premium based on theoretical considerations.\nThe article is an entry prepared for the Oxford Companion to Economics in India edited by Kaushik Basu\n\n",
