    "abstract": "\n\nExploiting the random assignment of Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care plans, we find substantial plan-specific spending effects despite plans having identical cost sharing. Enrollment in the lowest-spending plan generates 30% lower spending\u2014driven by differences in quantity\u2014relative to enrollment in the highest-spending plan. Rather than reducing \u201cwasteful\u201d spending, lower-spending plans broadly reduce medical service provision\u2014including the provision of low-cost, high-value care\u2014and worsen beneficiary satisfaction and health. Consumer demand follows spending: a 10 percent increase in plan-specific spending is associated with a 40 percent increase in market share. These facts have implications for the government\u2019s contracting problem and program cost growth.\n\n",
