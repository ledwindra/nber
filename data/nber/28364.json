    "abstract": "\n\nWe study identification and estimation of causal effects in settings with panel data. Traditionally researchers follow model-based identification strategies relying on assumptions governing the relation between the potential outcomes and the unobserved confounders. We focus on a novel, complementary, approach to identification where assumptions are made about the relation between the treatment assignment and the unobserved confounders. We introduce different sets of assumptions that follow the two paths to identification, and develop a double robust approach. We propose estimation methods that build on these identification strategies.\n\n",
