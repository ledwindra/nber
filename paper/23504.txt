Still More On Mariel: The Role of Race
George J. Borjas
NBER Working Paper No. 23504
June 2017
JEL No. J0,J61
ABSTRACT
Card’s (1990) study of the Mariel supply shock remains an important cornerstone of both the
literature that measures the labor market impact of immigration, and of the “stylized fact” that
immigration might not have much impact on the wage of workers in a receiving country. My
recent reappraisal of the Mariel evidence (Borjas, 2017) revealed that the wage of low-skill
workers in Miami declined substantially in the years after Mariel, and has already encouraged a
number of re-reexaminations. Most recently, Clemens and Hunt (2017) argue that a data quirk in
the CPS implies that wage trends in the sample of non-Hispanic prime-age men examined in my
paper does not correctly represent what happened to wages in post-Mariel Miami. Specifically,
there was a substantial increase in the black share of Miami’s low-skill workforce in the relevant
period (particularly between the 1979 and 1980 survey years of the March CPS). Because
African-American men earn less than white men, this increase in the black share would
spuriously produce a drop in the average low-skill wage in Miami. This paper examines the
robustness of the evidence presented in my original paper to statistical adjustments that control
for the increasing number of black men in Miami’s low-skill workforce. The evidence
consistently indicates that the race-adjusted low-skill wage in Miami fell significantly relative to
the wage in other labor markets shortly after 1980 before fully recovering by 1990.

Still More on Mariel: The Role of Race
George J. Borjas*
Since its public release in September 2015, my reappraisal of the wage impact of the
Mariel supply shock (Borjas, 2017) has attracted considerable attention. My study showed
that the long-believed “stylized fact” that the Marielitos did not have a wage impact on
Miami’s workers, first reported in Card (1990), did not truly represent what the data
actually said. Instead, my reappraisal indicated that the wage of Miami’s high school
dropouts, the group most affected by the low-skill Marielitos, had declined substantially
after 1980 but had fully recovered by 1990.
Not surprisingly, my reappraisal has itself inspired a number of re-reexaminations,
including Peri and Yasenov (2015) and Clemens and Hunt (2017). Peri and Yasenov argued
that the problem with my original analysis resulted from the rules I used for sample
selection. I examined wage trends using a sample of non-Hispanic men aged 25-59. Peri
and Yasenov proposed expanding the sample to include women, non-Cuban Hispanics, and
teenagers. As I showed in Borjas (2016), each of those sampling decisions introduced
highly questionable changes in sample composition that contaminated observed wage
trends.
Clemens and Hunt criticize my reappraisal from a different angle. Instead of
claiming that the sample of non-Hispanic prime-age men does not correctly represent what
the ideal sample should be, they instead argue that, from an operational standpoint, this
sample is unrepresentative. There seems to be a data issue, particularly in the March CPS,
that biases wage trends in this sample. In particular, there was a substantial increase in the
black share of the low-skill workforce in Miami in the relevant period. Because AfricanAmerican men earn less than white men, the increase in the black share of the low-skill
workforce would spuriously produce a drop in the average low-skill wage in Miami—a
wage drop that I incorrectly attributed to Mariel.

This short paper examines the robustness of the Mariel evidence presented in my
original paper to statistical adjustments that control for the increasing number of black
men in Miami’s low-skill workforce. The evidence reported in this paper uses exactly the
same sample examined throughout much of Borjas (2017): non-Hispanic men aged 25-59
who live in one of the 44 metropolitan areas identifiable in the CPS during the relevant
period. As a result, any changes in the statistical evidence reported below and the
comparable findings in my original paper can be attributed solely to the biases created by
the changing racial composition of the low-skill workforce.
The statistical analysis clearly shows that although the black share of the low-skill
workforce did rise in Miami, particularly in the March CPS and strikingly so in one single
year (survey year 1980), the evidence consistently indicates that the race-adjusted lowskill wage in Miami fell significantly relative to those in other labor markets shortly after
1980 before fully recovering by 1990.
1. The timing of the increase in the black share
There is a very simple and intuitive way of showing that the rising black share in
Miami’s low skill workforce cannot be the reason for the average wage drop observed
among low-skill workers in Miami after Mariel. The timing of the two events simply does
not coincide.
Figure 1 shows the year-by-year trend in the age-adjusted log weekly wage in the
March CPS between 1976 and 1990, while Figure 2 shows the respective trend in the ageadjusted log hourly wage in the ORG. All calculations reported throughout the paper use
sampling weights. It is worth emphasizing that the wage trends illustrated in Figures 1 and
2 are exactly the ones reported and examined in my Mariel paper.

The figures also plot the fraction of the low-skill workforce that is black. It is evident
that something strange happened to this fraction in calendar year 1979 in the March CPS

6
(which corresponds to survey year 1980), when it rose from 36.3 percent in 1978 to 63.0
percent in 1979. It is extremely unlikely that this shift reflects what was actually happening
in Miami’s low-skill labor market. Notably, the ORG does not show such a large increase in
the black share, as the ORG black share was already high prior to 1979.1 As a result, it
seems likely that the jump in the March statistic reflects a sampling issue, an imputation
problem, or an error in the construction/manipulation of the data by the BLS or IPUMS.
Note, however, that nothing whatsoever happened to the black share of the
workforce in the March CPS between the years 1979 and 1983. Notably these are the years
that witnessed the largest drop in the average wage of Miami’s low-skill workforce. To
emphasize again, the wage trend in Figure 1 is the wage trend used in the Borjas (2017)
paper—it includes blacks. The figure convincingly shows that there is no relationship
whatsoever between the fraction of blacks in the low-skill workforce and the average lowskill wage in those years that the average low-skill wage fell most. Therefore, it is
impossible to explain the steep wage drop in terms of a statistical spuriousness created by a
rising black share in the low-skill workforce. And this leads to an obvious inference: the
Clemens-Hunt argument is not consistent with the timing of the increase in the black share
and the drop in the average low-skill wage.
The ORG data in Figure 2 is equally striking. Again, the average low-skill wage in
Miami (including blacks) fell dramatically between 1980 and 1984 while the black share
rose slightly and then declined slightly over the period–ending up pretty much at the same
place it started. There is simply no way that the large wage drop observed in the first few
years after Mariel could somehow be related to a change in the racial composition of the
low-skill workforce in the ORG.

1 Interestingly, the 1980 census, conducted on April 1, 1980, just weeks before the Mariel supply

shock, reports that the black share in the sample of low-skill, non-Hispanic working men aged 25-54 was 54.5
percent. This evidence is consistent with the data from the 1980 March CPS and the corresponding data from
the ORG. The consistency suggests that the problem may lie with a systematic undercounting or misallocation
of low-skill black workers in the March CPS prior to the 1980 survey year.

7
2. Trends in the age- and race-adjusted wage
The most obvious way of isolating the importance of the change in the racial
composition of the sample on the average wage is to examine the trend in the race-adjusted
wage.
My original paper examines age-adjusted wage trends throughout much of the
analysis. I now conduct a parallel exercise that examines the trend in the age-adjusted and
race-adjusted wage. In particular, I used the sample of high school dropouts to estimate the
following regression model separately in each cross-section of the March CPS or ORG files:
(1)

log wit =

t+

t Ait + t Rit +

t Cit + it,

where wit is the weekly wage of worker i in cross-section t in the March CPS (or the hourly
wage of the worker in the ORG); Ait is a vector of fixed effects indicating the worker’s age;
Cit is a vector of fixed effects indicating the city of residence; and Rit is an indicator variable
telling us if the worker is African-American.
The residual of this regression, or eit, measures the age- and race-adjusted wage of
worker i at time t. These residuals obviously have zero mean. It is trivial to redefine the
residual so that it better reflects the actual wage level in a particular city at a particular
time. In particular, let

ct be the estimate of the fixed effect for city c in

of the age- and race-adjusted wage is then given by the sum (eit +

ct +

year t. The measure
t). The variables

added to the residual effectively allow for a person’s age- and race-adjusted wage to differ
systematically across cities (due to city fixed effects) and for that wage level to differ
systematically over time (due to year fixed effects).

Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the trend in this measure of the age- and race-adjusted
wage measure, using a 3-year moving average (as comparable graphs did in my original
paper). The graph also shows the 95 percent confidence interval. It is visually obvious that

9
something did indeed happen in Miami in the early 1980s in both the March CPS and the
ORG. Is it also obvious that whatever it is that happened in Miami led to a substantial and
significant decline in the age- and race-adjusted low-skill wage.
3. Regression analysis
What would happen to the regression results in the key Table 5 of my original paper
if one were to redo the entire analysis using the age- and race-adjusted wage of workers?
This remarkably easy and intuitive exercise, which would obviously be the first step in any
empirical analysis that attempts to determine the role played by racial composition, is
curiously not reported in Clemens and Hunt (2017).

Notes: Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. The data consist of annual observations for each
city between 1977 and 1992 (1980 excluded). All regressions include vectors of city and year fixed effects.
The table reports the interaction coefficients between a dummy variable indicating if the metropolitan area is
Miami and the timing of the post-Mariel period. All regressions are weighted by the number of observations
used to calculate the dependent variable. The number of observations of the synthetic control is a weighted
average of the sample size in the actual cities that make up the synthetic city.

Table 1 reports the regression coefficients resulting from this analysis. Let me
emphasize yet again: This exercise only adds a race indicator to the micro-level regression
model estimated in my original paper—as summarized by equation (1) in that paper. It
does not change anything else about the sample or regression specification.
It is evident that the regression coefficients–which measure the wage impact after
accounting for the changing black share of the workforce in Miami and elsewhere–still
show a significant wage drop in Miami relative to any placebo one cares to pick. And this is
true both in the March CPS data as well as in the ORG. So the key inference from the key
regression table in my paper is unchanged. Something happened to Miami’s low-skill wage
after 1980.
4. Changing the baseline
As Figure 1 makes clear, it is the change in the black share in the March CPS between
calendar years 1978 and 1979 (corresponding to survey years 1979 and 1980) that can
potentially represent a problem when comparing averaged pre-1980 data with averaged
post-1980 data. There is an alternative and very simple way of determining whether this
data quirk creates a problem for estimating the wage impact of Mariel: simply discard all
the March CPS data prior to calendar year 1979. By starting the series in calendar year
1979, the huge shift in the black share would no longer be able to contaminate the
regression model.
This approach, of course, requires that the baseline—the pre-Mariel period—be
defined differently. The simplest “trick” is to use the CPS data for calendar years 1979 and
1980 as the pre-Mariel years. The 1980 data is obviously contaminated by Mariel, as half
that year’s earnings were observed after the Marielitos arrived. But the use of 1980 data to
define the pre-treatment period should bias the results against finding any impact of Mariel.
I re-estimated the regression models in the March CPS and the ORG using the
calendar years 1979-1980 years as the pre-treatment period. Table 2 summarizes the
regression coefficients.

Notes: Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. The data consist of annual observations for each
city between 1979 and 1992. All regressions include vectors of city and year fixed effects. The table reports
the interaction coefficients between a dummy variable indicating if the metropolitan area is Miami and the
timing of the post-Mariel period. All regressions are weighted by the number of observations used to
calculate the dependent variable. The number of observations of the synthetic control is a weighted average
of the sample size in the actual cities that make up the synthetic city.

It is obvious that excluding from the analysis all the CPS March surveys that
reported a low share of the black workforce barely changes the results. In fact, an “eyeball”

12
comparison of the regression coefficients reported in the top panel in Table 2 with the
corresponding coefficients in my original paper (Borjas, 2017, Table 5) indicates that the
results barely change! As an example, consider the estimated wage impact on Miami
relative to all other cities in the 1984-1986 period. In my original paper, the estimated
effect was -0.393 (with a standard error of 0.022). Excluding all pre-1979 March CPS
observations leads to an estimated impact of -0.385 (0.029). There is no doubt, therefore,
that the post-1980 relative wage drop experienced by Miami’s low-skill workforce was
significantly steeper than that observed in all other comparison groups. This finding is not
surprising given the visual evidence reported earlier, as Miami’s low-skill wage did not
change much in the years leading up to 1980.
5. Combinatorial analysis
As I explicitly noted in my original paper, one of the troubling things about the
statistical methodology involved in Mariel-type research is that the researcher can
influence the answer by picking an appropriate set of placebo cities for comparison. The
increasingly popular synthetic control method is a very clever attempt to get rid of that
influence, but it is still problematic. The researcher is still free to select whichever control
variables he or she wants to use to create the synthetic city. And, as I show in Borjas (2017),
different sets of control variables lead to very different measured impacts.
So my favorite part of my Mariel paper was towards the end, where I chose to
eliminate researcher influence entirely by doing a combinatorial-type analysis. Why not
simply compare what happened in Miami to every single conceivable placebo and see what
the distribution of impacts across potential placebos looks like?
I operationalized this idea by constructing every single four-city placebo. Because
there are 43 cities besides Miami that can be identified in the CPS during that period, that
means that there are 123,410 conceivable four-city placebos. If the resulting distribution
across the 123,410 measured impacts had a lot of positive impacts, a lot of zero impacts,
and a lot of negative impacts, that information would be very informative about what the
"real" impact was. If, on the other hand, the distribution is composed mostly of negative
impacts, that too would be informative.

13

March CPS

Figure 6. Frequency distribution of short-run age- and race-adjusted wage effects,
ORG

I re-estimated the frequency distributions reported in Figure 8 of Borjas (2017)
using the age- and race-adjusted wage data, and using exactly the same regression
specification for estimating the “short-run wage impact.” The short-run effect gives the
relative wage change in Miami between the pre-Mariel period (1977-1979) and the postMariel period (1981-1986). In short, Figures 5 and 6 are identical to what was presented in
my original paper, except that they use age- and race-adjusted wage data.

14
It is again obvious that adjusting the data for race does not change the basic insight.
In the March CPS, the median impact is -0.18, which means the wage drop in Miami before
and after Mariel was around 18 percent larger than it was in the median placebo, and the
95 percent confidence interval covers the range between -0.25 and -0.08. Similarly, in the
ORG, the median impact is -0.05, and 95 percent of the effects lie between -0.10 and -0.01.
In sum, the short-run wage effect is negative, although the numerical magnitude has a wide
range.
I also redid the combinatorial analysis by using the 1979-1980 calendar years as the
baseline (as in the previous section), and then estimated the short-run wage impact for
each of the 123,410 potential placebos. This approach is completely unaffected by the quirk
in the reported black share of the low-skill workforce in the March CPS between calendar
years 1978 and 1979. The median wage effect in the March CPS was -0.23, and the range of
the 95 percent confidence interval was from -0.33 to -0.12. The median effect in the ORG
was -0.07, and the 95 percent confidence interval went from -0.11 to -0.02. The Appendix
presents the figures for the two frequency distributions that use the 1979-1980 calendar
years as the baseline.
6. Calculating the race-adjusted wage
In a recent blog post, Clemens (2017) noted that the regression evidence
summarized in Table 1 is indeed correct. The race adjustment performed in equation (1) by
simply adding a race fixed effect to the micro-level regression model in each cross-section
leads to wage trends that still indicate a decline in Miami’s low-skill wage after Mariel. This
very simple type of race adjustment is, by far, the most straightforward (and parsimonious)
way to fix concerns about sampling.
The blog post, however, also notes that an alternative approach to adjusting for
race—where the race variable in each cross-section is introduced not only as a fixed effect,
but as a fixed effect interacted with metropolitan area and education (so that the racial
wage gap for an education group in a particular city is allowed to vary over time)—takes
away much of the significant wage drop. In an important sense, this response moves the
“goalpost” of the Clemens-Hunt criticism of my Mariel paper. It is no longer that the change
in the black share of the workforce induced a spurious correlation that led to lower wages

15
in post-Mariel Miami; the evidence reported in the previous sections shows that this
particular argument is just plain wrong. It is now instead that the measured wage impact of
Mariel could be zero if we calculate the race-adjusted wage by allowing for the racial wage
gap for low-skill workers to vary over time in a city like Miami.
Let’s put aside momentarily the conceptual issue of whether it is proper to calculate
the race-adjusted wage by netting out the time-series variation in the racial wage gap
within a city (a variation that may have arisen because of immigration). If we had a lot of
data available, the conventional approach to estimating the race-adjusted wage would be to
include a fully interacted set of fixed effects in the regression model. The fully interactive
regression specification used to calculate the age- and race-adjusted wage for worker i
would be given by:

the age fixed effects (Ait), and the variable indicating the worker’s race (Rit). Because the
micro-level regression is estimated separately in each CPS cross-section, the model is also
fully interactive with respective to time. Therefore, this model allows variation in the racial
wage gap across age-education-city cells at a point in time and within each cell over time.
The age- and race-adjusted wage is given by the residual of this regression, and I use this
residual to calculate the mean age- and race-adjusted wage in each city in each year for
high school dropouts.

Notes: Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. The data consist of annual observations for each
city between 1977 and 1992 (1980 excluded). All regressions include vectors of city and year fixed effects.
The table reports the interaction coefficients between a dummy variable indicating if the metropolitan area is
Miami and the timing of the post-Mariel period. All regressions are weighted by the number of observations
used to calculate the dependent variable. The number of observations of the synthetic control is a weighted
average of the sample size in the actual cities that make up the synthetic city.

The top panel of Table 3 summarizes the regression results using this alternative
measure of the age- and race-adjusted wage. The magnitude of the estimated wage impacts
is far smaller (particularly in the March CPS) than in the comparable regressions that
excluded all the interactions in Table 1. This is not surprising because the use of a fully
interactive model nets out much of the wage variation that exists across the various
“markets.” The typical March CPS cross-section in the 1980s, for instance, has 8,865
observations. The fully interactive model adds 2,816 regressors to the regression (or 44

17
metro areas × 4 education groups × 8 age groups × 2 race groups). Given the relatively
small sample sizes available in the March cross-sections and the large number of
regressors, it is also not surprising that this kitchen-sink approach reduces the precision of
the estimates in Table 3 sufficiently so that the null hypothesis of “no effect” can no longer
be rejected. Remarkably, many of the wage impacts remain negative and significant in the
ORG, particularly when there is more variation in the data (as in the regression that
compares Miami to all other cities). So there is still a suggestion that low-skill workers in
post-Mariel Miami experienced a steeper wage drop than comparable workers in other
cities.
However, it is far from clear that one should interpret the regression coefficients
resulting from this fully interactive model as measuring the wage impact of immigration. As
I noted above, the variation in the racial wage gap for a particular education group across
cities and over time might have arisen because of immigration. It seems plausible, for
instance, that a supply shock might affect the wage and employment of low-skill black and
white workers differently.2 There are substantial differences in the jobs the two groups
hold, in the occupations they enter, and in the industries that employ them. A particular
supply shock—such as Mariel—inevitably penetrated some sectors more than others,
affecting the magnitude of the racial wage gap for a particular education group in Miami
relative to other cities. The residual from a regression that nets out this differential impact
removes much of the effect that immigration might have had on the local labor market. As a
result, it would not be surprising if models that calculate the race-adjusted wage after
netting out the impact that immigration might have had on the racial wage gap generate
smaller, and perhaps near zero, measured impacts of immigration.
To illustrate the quantitative importance of this bias, the second panel of Table 3
uses an alternative model that relies on binary interactions.
2 Very few studies estimate the potentially disparate impact of immigration on black and white

workers. Borjas, Grogger, and Hanson (2010) model the source of the different effects, but do not separately
estimate the impact of immigration on low-skill blacks and whites. The wage elasticity—estimated using data
from all education groups—is essentially the same for the two race groups, but immigration has a much
greater adverse effect on black employment. Smith (2012, Table 8) also finds that low-skill immigration leads
to a much greater reduction in annual hours worked by black young men than by white young men. The early
work of Altonji and Card (1991, Tables 7.8 and 7.9, column 4) does estimate the elasticity separately for the
two low-skill groups. The negative wage effect is almost twice as large for blacks as it is for whites.

This model includes all two-way interactions—(city race), (education race), and (age
race)—when calculating the race-adjusted wage in each cross-section. Let me emphasize
that this regression model is estimated separately in each cross-section, allowing for the
average racial wage gap in each city to vary over time, and for the average racial wage gap
for each education (or age) group to also vary over time. The crucial property of the binary
model is that its residual (i.e., the measure of the race-adjusted wage) does not net out that
the racial wage gap for high school dropouts in a particular city (like Miami) might have
changed over time. As Table 3 shows, this alternative approach to calculating the raceadjusted wage leads to a much larger wage drop in post-Mariel Miami than in comparison
cities, and the estimated wage effects, as in my original paper, are significant.

It is easy to illustrate the source of the bias induced by a fully interactive model with
a trivial numerical example, summarized in Table 4. Suppose there are two cities, Miami
and New York. New York did not receive any immigrants, but Miami did. The table shows
the average wage of black and white low-skill workers in the two cities before and after the
supply shock. The top panel gives the unadjusted wage data (i.e., the data that would be
available in the CPS). By construction, immigration had a much larger impact on black
workers in Miami, reducing their wage from $7 to $4, while the wage of white workers fell
by only $1, from $10 to $9.
The middle panel of the table shows the race-adjusted wage in each city. The
regression that includes a complete set of interactions between city, education, race, and
year would “see” that there is a $3 racial wage gap among low-skill workers in Miami prior
to the supply shock, and use that information to conclude that the race-adjusted wage of a
black worker should be $10. After the supply shock, the regression model would “see” a $5
racial wage gap, and use that information to conclude that the race-adjusted wage of a
black worker should be $9.
Suppose that half of Miami’s workforce is black. The average race-adjusted wage in
Miami fell from $10 to $9, or 10 percent. In fact, however, the average wage in Miami fell
from $8.50 to $6.50, or nearly a 25 percent drop. Ignoring the fact that the supply shock
might have increased the racial wage gap greatly underestimates the wage impact of
immigration.
The bottom panel of Table 4 shows what would happen if we used an alternative
regression specification that did not “throw the baby out with the bathwater.” Suppose, in
particular, that Miami is a small city relative to New York, so that the national racial wage
gap in the post-migration period is $3. The regression model that includes only a race-year
interaction would then yield a race-adjusted post-migration wage for black workers in
Miami of $6 (or $3 less than what whites get), indicating that the average race-adjusted
wage in Miami fell from $10 to $7.50, or 25 percent.
I can even extend this numerical example in a more subtle direction. Perhaps the $3
racial wage gap in Miami in the pre-migration period represents the “true” (and
permanent) discriminatory penalty suffered by low-skill black workers in the Miami labor
market. We could then use that information to calculate the race-adjusted wage of a black

20
worker in Miami in the post-migration period, and that race-adjusted wage would again be
$6. The average race-adjusted wage in Miami would again fall by 25 percent.
In short, the empirical exercise used to compute the race-adjusted wage in a city at a
point in time should not follow blindly from a kitchen-sink approach to regressions. Careful
thought must be given to why racial wage differences might arise within skill groups and
across cities, how the time trend of those racial differences might be affected by
immigration, and exactly which value of the racial “wage penalty” should be used in the
calculation of a race-adjusted wage. To the extent that immigration may have contributed
to racial wage differences, particularly in post-Mariel Miami, it is incorrect to calculate a
race-adjusted wage that nets out that variation. In the end, the use of a simple linear race
fixed effect that varies over time, and perhaps even across education groups, seems to be
an important virtue of a more sensible research strategy, both because of the small sample
sizes involved and because it does not introduce any risk that it inadvertently wipes away
the impact we are trying to estimate.

7. Summary
It is evident that adjusting for the racial composition of the workforce in either the
March CPS or the ORG files does not change the key insight of the Mariel reappraisal in
Borjas (2017). The relative wage of low-skill workers in Miami fell significantly in the
period after Mariel, reaching a nadir somewhere around the mid-1980s and recovering
fully by 1990. The claim that changes in the racial composition of Miami’s workforce
created a spurious correlation that explains this wage trend is demonstrably false.
