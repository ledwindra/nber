Deaths of Despair or Drug Problems?

ABSTRACT
The United States is in the midst of a fatal drug epidemic. This study uses data from the Multiple
Cause of Death Files to examine the extent to which increases in county-level drug mortality rates
from 1999-2015 are due to “deaths of despair”, measured here by deterioration in medium-run
economic conditions, or if they instead are more likely to reflect changes in the “drug
environment” in ways that present differential risks to population subgroups. A primary finding is
that counties experiencing relative economic decline did experience higher growth in drug
mortality than those with more robust growth, but the relationship is weak and mostly explained
by confounding factors. In the preferred estimates, changes in economic conditions account for
less than one-tenth of the rise in drug and opioid-involved mortality rates. The contribution of
economic factors is even less when accounting for plausible selection on unobservables, with
even a small amount of remaining confounding factors being sufficient to entirely eliminate the
relationship. These results suggest that the “deaths of despair” framing, while provocative, is
unlikely to explain the main sources of the fatal drug epidemic and that efforts to improve
economic conditions in distressed locations, while desirable for other reasons, are not likely to
yield significant reductions in drug mortality. Conversely, the risk of drug deaths varies
systematically over time across population subgroups in ways that are consistent with an
important role for the public health environment related to the availability and cost of drugs. Put
succinctly, the fatal overdose epidemic is likely to primarily reflect drug problems rather than
deaths of despair.

1. Introduction
The United States is in the midst of a fatal drug epidemic. The number of Americans
dying from drugs rose from 16,849 to 63,632 between 1999 and 2016 (Hedegaard, Warner, and
Miniño 2017). Drug overdoses are the leading cause of injury deaths in the United States,
exceeding the number of motor vehicle fatalities since 2009 (Paulozzi 2012). The rapid growth
in drug mortality originally involved prescription opioids like OxyContin, often in combination
with other drugs (Jones, Mack, and Paulozzi 2013; Paulozzi, Mack, and Hockenberry 2014).
However, the 19,413 and 15,469 fatalities during 2016 with available data reported to involve
synthetic opioids (mostly fentanyl) and heroin substantially exceeded the 14,487 fatalities
involving opioid analgesics (Hedegaard, Warner, and Miniño 2017).
Poisoning deaths, over 90 percent of which are now due to drugs, are by far the most
important factor explaining the declines in life expectancy observed since 1999 initially among
45-54 year old non-Hispanic whites in research by Anne Case and Angus Deaton (2015) and
subsequently among a broader age range of mid-life whites (Kochanek, Arias, and Bastian 2016;
Kolata and Cohen 2016; Squires and Blumenthal 2016). Case and Deaton attribute this rising
mortality to “deaths of despair” (Case and Deaton 2017; Deaton 2017) which they view as a
form of suicide that “respond(s) more to prolonged economic conditions than to short-term
fluctuations, and especially social dysfunctions … that come with prolonged economic distress”
(Deaton 2017, p. 3). 1 In their view, it is the social and economic environment rather than opioids
(and presumably drugs more generally) that are the fundamental causes of increased deaths.
At first glance, the particularly large rise in drug mortality in Appalachia and the rust-belt
seems consistent with the deaths of despair hypothesis. However, other areas not associated with
1

Others have asserted potential roles for rising income inequality, international trade, stagnant wages, increased
unemployment or general social and economic decline (Stiglitz 2015; Meara and Skinner 2015; Pierce and Schott
2016).

declining economies have also experienced strong upsurges in overdose fatality rates, 2 and it is
difficult to reconcile this mechanism with important patterns of life expectancy and mortality.
For instance, why has the increase in drug mortality been dramatically larger for whites than
non-whites, even though the latter group has faced greater economic insecurity and worse
economic conditions? And why aren’t similar increases being observed among midlife adults in
other developed countries that have also faced difficult economic times? 3
One alternative is that it is changes in the availability and use of risky drugs that are of
particular importance – in short that the drug environment rather than economy is the key driver
in rising drug fatalities. Under such an explanation, whites might have been more affected than
nonwhites because they have been more widely prescribed opioids (K. O. Anderson, Green, and
Payne 2009; Burgess et al. 2014; Singhal, Tien, and Hsia 2016) and deaths in the United States
might have increased more than in other countries because the large majority of opioid
consumption has occurred in the U.S. 4 Similarly, drug fatality rates might have increased most
rapidly in rural areas with relatively low average education levels if less educated individuals are
particularly vulnerable to a more dangerous drug environment because they lack knowledge
about the risks (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2010) or have less to lose from them (Becker and
Murphy 1988). If so, the measured effect of changes in macroeconomic conditions should
decline or disappear once county population characteristics are controlled for.
This study sheds light on the relative contribution of these two mechanisms – deaths of
despair versus deaths from the drug environment – to the rapid rise in fatal overdoses. The first

For instance, New Hampshire had the highest state opioid fatality rate in 2014 and Massachusetts had the fourth
highest rate (Ruhm 2017b).
3
Case and Deaton (2017) present evidence showing that there has been little change in drug, alcohol and suicide
mortality since the turn of the century for 50-54 year olds in France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom,
Canada and Australia.
4
In 2007 the United States contained 4.6 percent of the world’s population but constituted 80 percent of global
opioid and 99 percent of global hydrocodone consumption (Manchikanti et al. 2010).
Page 3

part of the analysis estimates the extent to which deteriorating economic conditions explain the
growth in overdose deaths. In addition to drug mortality, Case and Deaton (2015) also emphasize
the importance of deaths due to suicide and alcoholic liver disease (hereafter referred to as
“alcohol”). 5 With this in mind, this investigation also includes deaths from drugs, nondrug
suicides and alcohol (DSA) as a group and, separately, those from nondrug suicides (hereafter
often referred to simply as suicides) and alcohol.
To operationalize the examination of “deaths of despair”, I focus on medium-run changes
in a variety of economic factors including dimensions related to labor market outcomes,
household wealth and international trade shocks. This is distinguished from prior literature
examining how transitory economic fluctuations have affected various types of drug use or
abuse (Arkes 2007; Ruhm 2015; Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees 2017; Martin Bassols and Vall
Castelló 2016; Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017). The working assumption is that
economic conditions cause changes in drug use and problems. However, there is some evidence
of reverse causation – whereby rising opioid use has had negative effects on labor markets
(Krueger 2017). To the extent this occurs, the analysis below may overstate the role of economic
conditions as a contributor to the fatal drug epidemic.
As a second step, evidence is provided on the alternative hypothesis that changes in the
drug environment are a main cause of rising overdose deaths. Since directly measuring the role
of such environmental factors is difficult, the strategy used below is the exploit the dramatic
changes in the sources of drug-related deaths that occurred over the sample period. Specifically,
growth in fatal overdoses early in the sample period was dominated by a rise in deaths involving
opioid analgesic medications, while later increases (since around 2010) have primarily involved

5

Dowell et al. (2017) confirm that mortality rates from these sources have trended upward, albeit by fairly small
amounts.

illicit opioids such as heroin and fentanyl. If economic conditions are the primary driver of fatal
drug epidemic, there would be no reason to expect these shifts in the drug composition to affect
the distribution of the demographic groups killed by overdoses. Instead, individuals selfmedicating for their “despair” would simply switch to the newly more available types of drugs.
Conversely, if the drug environment is the key driver, we anticipate changes in the composition
of overdose fatalities, with groups at higher risk of abusing prescription opioids having the
largest increases in drug death rates early in the analysis period whereas those most vulnerable to
abuse of illicit opioids experiencing the greatest growth in mortality towards the end of it.
Economists and other social scientists have previously examined how specific factors or
policies are related to opioid use or drug fatalities including the roles of: medical marijuana
(Powell, Pacula, and Jacobson 2015; Chu 2015; A. C. Bradford and Bradford 2016; Ozluk 2017),
abuse-deterrent drug formulations (Alpert, Powell, and Pacula 2017; Evans, Lieber, and Power
2017), Naloxone availability (Rees et al. 2017; Doleac and Mukherjee 2017), Medicare Part D
(Powell, Pacula, and Taylor 2015), the availability of substance abuse treatment (Swensen 2015),
advertising (D. M. Anderson 2010), physician market structure (W. D. Bradford 2017), and state
policies influencing the availability of prescription opioids (Dowell et al. 2016; Meinhofer 2016;
Buchmueller and Carey 2018; Dave, Grecu, and Saffer 2017). However, any observed effects
explain, at most, only a small portion of the overall change in overdose deaths. 6 This study is
attempting to examine the broader question of the sources of extremely large (211 percent from
1999-2015) overall rise in drug deaths. The analysis also implements methods of measuring the
combined effects of multiple proxies for economic conditions, accounting for the incomplete

6

For example, Dowell et al. (2016) find that implementing a combination of two state policies designed to reduce
access to prescription opioids (pain clinic laws and mandated provider review of information in prescription drug
monitoring programs) would reduce drug overdose deaths by around 12 percent.

reporting of drug involvement on death certificates, and testing the sensitivity of the findings to
the presence of uncontrolled for confounding factors.
The investigation reveals four main findings. First, counties suffering relative or absolute
decline did have larger increases in drug and total DSA mortality rates than those with better
economic performance. This pattern shows up using most of the economic proxies examined
below, in part because they are generally reasonably highly correlated with each other. Second,
the estimated impact of the economy is dramatically attenuated – by over 70 percent for drug
fatalities and 90 percent or more for all DSA deaths – when adding controls for county-level
characteristics, implying that the observed correlations are likely to be largely spurious. Third, in
the preferred specifications, changes in economic conditions explain less than one-tenth of the
observed increase in drug deaths occurring from 1999-2015 and even less of the growth in opioid
analgesic or illicit opioid-involved mortality. In sensitivity tests, a slightly larger share of the
increase in drug deaths may be explained by economic factors for some groups and, even using
the multiple proxy (MP) methods, it is possible that there is modest remaining attenuation bias.
On the other hand, even small amounts of selection on unobservables would be sufficient to
completely eliminate the contributions of economic factors, making it quite plausible that
“deaths of despair’ play no role at all. Fourth, the patterns of drug deaths across sex and age
subgroups suggests that changes in the drug environment may be an important determinant of
rising drug mortality. Of particular relevance, the explosive growth in illicit opioid death rates
after 2010 was accompanied a rising share of drug deaths being accounted for by males and
relatively young adults, as well as a faster growth in fatalities involving these drugs for them
relative to females and older adults. Overall, the results raise doubts about the hypothesis that

Page 6

economic decline is a primary cause of rising overdose mortality and instead suggest an
important role for the drug environment.

2. Methods
2.1 Basic Framework for Examining the Deaths of Despair Hypothesis
I examine the extent to which sustained deterioration in economic conditions is a driver
of the increase in fatal overdoses by performing a county-level analysis where the outcomes are
changes in various types of drug and DSA mortality rates and the key explanatory variables are
five measures for economic conditions. In all cases, the dependent variables and economic
proxies represent “long-changes”, covering substantial periods of time. In the primary model,
changes in county level fatal overdose rates cover the period 1999-2015, with subperiods
sometimes examined. The economic proxies examine changes over the same or similar periods,
although the end period for the indicator of import competition is 2011, due to data limitations.
Consider a model where mortality rates per 100,000 in county 𝑘𝑘 at time 𝑡𝑡 are 𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 . Let

𝑡𝑡 = [0,1] denote an early and later period (usually 1999 and 2015) with mortality determined
according to:
(1)

𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 𝑬𝑬𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝒃𝒃 + 𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝒄𝒄𝒕𝒕

where 𝑬𝑬𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 represents one or more proxies for economic conditions and 𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 is a vector of

supplementary determinants of mortality. The coefficients on the supplementary regressors can
change over time, reflecting potential shifts in determinants of mortality that differentially affect
population subgroups, while the effect of economic conditions is assumed to be time-invariant.
The change in mortality rates between the two periods can be written as:
(2)

∆𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 = 𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘1 − 𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘0 = ∆𝑬𝑬𝑘𝑘 𝒃𝒃 + 𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘0 ∆𝒄𝒄 + ∆𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘 𝑐𝑐1,
Page 7

where ∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘 = 𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘1 − 𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘0, ∆𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘 = 𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘1 − 𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘0 , and ∆𝒄𝒄 = 𝑐𝑐1 − 𝑐𝑐0 . The regression analog to (2) is:
(3)

where 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 is the error term. 7

∆𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 = ∆𝑬𝑬𝑘𝑘 𝛽𝛽 + 𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘0 𝛾𝛾1 + ∆𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘 𝛾𝛾2 + 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 ,

The coefficients of interest, 𝛽𝛽̂ , show estimated economic effects on mortality growth. A

requirement for unbiased estimates is cov(∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘 , 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 ) = 0, implying that the supplementary
covariates must adequately control for influences on mortality trends that are spuriously

correlated with ∆𝑬𝑬. However, the estimates will be attenuated if the vector of supplementary

covariates contains variables that are caused by changes in economic conditions. This is not a
problem for the predetermined variables, 𝑿𝑿0 , but could be an issue for ∆𝑿𝑿. For example,

individuals, particularly young ones, often migrate to areas with better economic conditions
(Greenwood 1997), implying that changes in age-specific population shares are likely to be
influenced by economic conditions. 8
For this reason, I also estimate an alternative version of equation (3) using
“instrumented” values of ∆𝑿𝑿, denoted hereafter as ∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰 , that are constructed by calculating

changes between initial year county level values of 𝑿𝑿 and census division changes occurring

between the starting and ending analysis years. For continuous variables, these are calculated as:
(4)

∆𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘𝐼𝐼 = 𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘0 ×

7

𝑋𝑋𝑑𝑑1 −𝑋𝑋𝑑𝑑0
𝑋𝑋𝑑𝑑0

It is unclear conceptually how to examine the effects of changes over time in economic conditions in a framework
where these effects are time-varying. Empirically, such a model would be estimated as: ∆𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 = 𝑬𝑬𝟎𝟎 𝜶𝜶 + ∆𝑬𝑬𝑘𝑘 𝛽𝛽 +
𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘0 𝛾𝛾1 + ∆𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘 𝛾𝛾2 + 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 . I briefly discuss below the results of estimating this model when examining changes in total
drug mortality rates.
8
Similarly, Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2017) show that localities hit by international trade shocks experience
reductions in the supply of marriageable men and increases in the fraction of children born to unwed mothers.
Page 8

where 𝑋𝑋𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 refers to the value of the supplemental covariate in census division 𝑑𝑑 containing

county 𝑘𝑘. The operational assumption here is that economic conditions may causally affect the
supplementary covariates within but not across census divisions.9

The vector of covariates also includes binary variables indicating whether states have
specific policies in place (as described below). In all cases, once implemented, these policies
remained in effect through the end of the sample period. Therefore, for these variables. ∆𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘𝐼𝐼 was

set to zero for counties with the policies in place at time 0 (i.e. 𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘0 = 1). Where this was not the
case (i.e. where 𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘0 = 0), the instrumented change was calculated as the expected change in

census division values for persons in counties without the policy at time 0:

(5)

∆𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘𝐼𝐼 |𝑋𝑋𝑘𝑘0 =0 = (𝑋𝑋𝑑𝑑1 − 𝑋𝑋𝑑𝑑0 )|𝑋𝑋𝑑𝑑0 =0 .

As mentioned, estimates using actual values of ∆𝑿𝑿 may suffer from endogeneity bias.

Models controlling for ∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰 largely avoid this problem but at the cost of less fully accounting for
potential confounding factors. Therefore, I present results for specifications that alternatively

control for ∆𝑿𝑿 and ∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰 . Empirically, the estimated economic effects are generally attenuated

more when including ∆𝑿𝑿 rather than ∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰 .

In the most specifications, observations are weighted by 2015 county populations, to

avoid attributing undue influence to the treatment effects observed in small counties. 10 However,
since weighting can reduce efficiency under some circumstances (Wooldridge 1999; Solon,
Haider, and Wooldridge 2015), sensitivity of the results to use of unweighted estimates is
explored. Also, most models examine how changes in mortality rates from 1999-2015 are related
to the evolution of economic conditions over approximately the same period. However, I also

9

For the migration example, this would imply that individuals might systematically move to counties with better
economic conditions within a census region but not outside it.
10
For example, in 2015, the smallest 50 percent of counties contained just 5.8 percent of the U.S. population.
Page 9

estimate specifications where economic conditions operate with a delay, by controlling for
lagged, rather than contemporaneous, changes in these variables over approximately the 19902000 period.
The explanatory variables, ∆𝑬𝑬, 𝑿𝑿𝟎𝟎 , ∆𝑿𝑿 and ∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰 , are standardized to have a mean of zero

and a standard deviation of one (by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation),
so that the regression coefficients show estimated “effect sizes” of a one standard deviation
change in the regressor and the intercept term indicates the average change in the dependent
variable.
The general empirical strategy is to use the econometric results from equation (3) to
estimate how changes in economic conditions affect trends in fatal overdoses and then to
compare these predicted impacts to the total change over the period. In a model with only a
single proxy for economic conditions, this is measured as:
% of ∆M Explained =

(6)

�
β

σM

× 100%

where 𝛽𝛽̂ is the regression coefficient on ∆𝑬𝑬, from (3), and 𝜎𝜎𝑀𝑀 is the standard deviation of the
change in mortality rates. Since ∆𝑬𝑬 has been standardized,

�
𝛽𝛽

𝜎𝜎𝑀𝑀

shows the standard deviation

change in mortality rates expected to result from a one standard deviation increase in the
economic proxy. For example, if a one standard deviation increase in ∆𝑬𝑬 predicts a one-half
standard deviation increase in ∆𝑀𝑀 (i.e. if 𝛽𝛽̂ = 0.5𝜎𝜎𝑀𝑀 ), 50 percent of the mortality growth is

estimated to be accounted for by changing economic conditions.
2.2 Multiple Proxy Estimates

Implementing the strategy just described faces multiple challenges. There is not a clear
conceptual framework determining what aspects of the economy are likely to be most important

Page 10

determinants of growth in drug mortality, nor exactly what is meant by changes in economic
conditions. This is addressed by including proxies for multiple, potentially overlapping, aspects
of the economy including: labor market conditions, the level and distribution of income, housing
prices which are an important component of household wealth, and international trade exposure.
Since no single economic indicator completely captures the effects of interest, estimates
from a lone measure will suffer from attenuation bias. The primary strategy to address this is to
implement the method developed by Lubotsky and Wittenberg (2006) for simultaneously
including multiple proxies in the model and then including a weighted sum of the coefficients to
minimize attenuation bias.
In this approach, 𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘∗ is a latent variable for economic conditions that affects changes in

mortality rates according to:
(7)

∆𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 = 𝛽𝛽∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘∗ + 𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘0 𝛾𝛾1 + ∆𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘 𝛾𝛾2 + 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 .

We do not observe 𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘∗ but instead have multiple proxies, 𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 , where the additional subscript
indicates the jth proxy, which are related to the latent variable according to:
∗
+ 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 .
∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 ∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘

(8)

The key assumptions are that ∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘∗ is uncorrelated with 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 and that all of the 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 are uncorrelated

with ∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘∗ and 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 . The second assumption implies that the proxy variables operate only through
their effect on ∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘∗ and do not independently affect ∆𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 . An important advantage of this

framework is that the covariances between the error terms of the economic proxies (𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ) are

unrestricted and, specifically, are allowed to be non-zero. 11

11

Alternative approaches including instrumental variables estimates and factor or principal component analyses
require zero covariances. Models with a single economic proxy will suffer from attenuation bias. Suppressing the
supplementary covariates and with the simplifying normalization that 𝜌𝜌1 = 1, the OLS estimator of ∆𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 = 𝛽𝛽1 ∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘 +
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝐸𝐸 ∗ )
𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 converges to 𝛽𝛽̂1 = 𝛽𝛽
, which is biased towards zero for positive 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜇𝜇1 ).
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝐸𝐸 ∗ )+𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜇𝜇1 )

Page 11

Equations (7) and (8) cannot be directly estimated, since 𝐸𝐸 ∗ is unobserved, but Lubotsky

and Wittenberg (LW) show that attenuation bias can be minimized by simultaneously including
all of the economic proxies in the model in the regression model:
∆𝑀𝑀𝑘𝑘 = ∑𝑚𝑚
𝑗𝑗=1 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 ∆𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘0 𝛾𝛾1 + ∆𝑿𝑿𝑘𝑘 𝛾𝛾2 + 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 ,

(9)

(where 𝑚𝑚 = 5 in this application), and then calculating the weighted sum of the proxy
coefficients as:

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(∆𝑀𝑀,∆𝐸𝐸𝑗𝑗 )
𝛽𝛽̂ = ∑𝑚𝑚
𝛽𝛽̂𝑗𝑗 ,
𝑗𝑗=1

(10)

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(∆𝑀𝑀,∆𝐸𝐸1 )

where ∆𝐸𝐸1 is the proxy chosen as the base. I use as ∆𝐸𝐸1 the proxy with the largest regression

coefficient (𝛽𝛽̂𝑗𝑗 ) in a model that includes all of the economic measures but without supplementary

covariates. LW show that 𝛽𝛽̂ , calculated in this manner, has the same scale as ∆𝐸𝐸1 . 12 Since the

explanatory variables are all standardized, 𝛽𝛽̂ can also be interpreted indicating effect sizes for

changes in the latent variable ∆𝐸𝐸 ∗ . However, to the extent that the vector of proxy variables does
not fully account for all aspects of ∆𝐸𝐸 ∗ , some attenuation bias may remain.

As an alternative, I address the issue of attenuation bias through a series of instrumental

variables (IV) models, estimated by generalized methods of moments (GMM) to increase
efficiency with heteroskedastic errors, where each of the economic proxies is instrumented by
the other four. These are not the primary estimates for two reasons. First, the IV procedure
assumes that the error terms, 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 , for the individual proxies in equation (8), are uncorrelated with
each other. This is unlikely and implies that the IV estimates could be biased either upwards or
downwards. Second, the estimates may vary sharply depending on which of the economic
proxies is instrumented for.
12

For these estimates, I “reverse code” the standardized changes in median household incomes and home prices (by
switching the sign on the variables) so that positive coefficients on all of the economic proxies indicate that
deteriorating economic conditions raise the growth rate of drug deaths.

tables. 13 All analyses was conducted using STATA Statistical Software: Release 15 (StataCorp
2017).

2.3 Incomplete Specification of Drug Categories Involved in Overdose Deaths
Identifying the drug involved in fatal overdoses is complicated because no specific drug
category is identified on the death certificates on around one-fifth of drug fatalities, leading to a
substantial understatement of mortality rates involving specific drug categories. 14 Corrected
mortality rates were obtained using information from death certificate reports where at least one
specific drug category was identified to impute drug involvement for cases where none was
identified, using a procedure previously implemented by Ruhm (Ruhm 2017b).
Year-specific probit models were first estimated for the sample of fatal overdoses with at
least one drug specified on the death certificate. The dependent variables in these models were
equal to one if opioid analgesics or illicit opioids, respectively, were mentioned and zero if not.
Dichotomous explanatory variables included: sex, race (white, black, other nonwhite), Hispanic
origin, marital status (currently married at the time of death versus not), education categories
(high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, college graduate), age categories (≤20,
21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, >70), day-of-the-week of death indicators, location of death
(hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient/ED, dead on arrival at hospital/ED, home, other) and
census region. Predicted probabilities of opioid analgesic or illicit opioid involvement were next

13

Clustering is at the commuter zone this is the level of the observations on the import exposure variable, as
discussed below.
14
This was the case for 21.9 percent of overdose fatalities in 1999 and 17.2 percent in 2015. For these fatalities, the
death certificate lists only an unspecified category of drugs (ICD T-Code 50.9).
Page 13

imputed, using the probit estimates, for deaths without mention of a specified drug category.
Robustness of the results to the use of uncorrected mortality rates was also examined.

2.4 Selection on Unobservables
A condition for obtaining unbiased estimates of the economic measures of key interest, 𝛽𝛽̂

in equation (3), is that cov(∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘 , 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 ) = 0 or, equivalently, that the supplementary covariates 𝑿𝑿0

and ∆𝑿𝑿 account for all relevant confounding factors. However, if there are omitted variables that
affect mortality rates and are correlated with ∆𝐸𝐸, cov(∆𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘 , 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 ) ≠ 0) and 𝛽𝛽̂ will be biased. This is

referred to below as selection on unobservables and examined using methods developed by Oster
(2016) that extend on those introduced by Altonji, Elder and Taber (2005).
Some additional notation is useful for describing the method. Define 𝛽𝛽 𝑜𝑜 and 𝑅𝑅 𝑜𝑜 as the

coefficient on 𝐸𝐸 and the R-squared from a “short” regression of equation (3), that excludes

controls for 𝑿𝑿𝟎𝟎 and ∆𝑿𝑿; 𝛽𝛽� and 𝑅𝑅� are the corresponding coefficient and R-squared from the

“long” equation that includes the supplementary covariates. Let 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 be the R-squared that

would be obtained from a hypothetical regression that includes an additional vector of covariates,
𝑾𝑾, that are orthogonal to 𝑿𝑿𝟎𝟎 and ∆𝑿𝑿 and capture all remaining determinants of mortality rates.

𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 will be less than one if the dependent variable is measured with error. 15 Finally, δ measures
the relative importance of selection of observables and unobservables: δ=1 implies the two are
equally important; δ<1 indicates that selection on observables is more important. 16
Oster (2016) shows that the true treatment effect is approximated by:
(11)
15
16

𝑅𝑅
−𝑅𝑅�
𝛽𝛽 ∗ ≈ 𝛽𝛽� − 𝛿𝛿(𝛽𝛽 𝑜𝑜 − 𝛽𝛽�) � 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
�.
� − 𝑅𝑅𝑜𝑜

For instance, this will occur if there is misclassification in the cause of death or drugs involved in fatal overdoses.
Specifically, defining 𝜎𝜎𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋 as the covariance between 𝑿𝑿 and ∆𝑬𝑬 and 𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 as the covariance between 𝑾𝑾 and ∆𝑬𝑬,

2
being the variances in 𝑿𝑿 and 𝑾𝑾, 𝛿𝛿 =
and with 𝜎𝜎𝑋𝑋2 and 𝜎𝜎𝑊𝑊

.

The magnitude of the difference between 𝛽𝛽 ∗ and 𝛽𝛽� is therefore increasing in δ, 𝛽𝛽 𝑜𝑜 − 𝛽𝛽�, 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 −
𝑅𝑅� , and 𝑅𝑅 𝑜𝑜 − 𝑅𝑅� . Verbally, the difference between 𝛽𝛽 ∗ and 𝛽𝛽� increases as selection on

unobservables becomes more important, the difference between the observed R-squared (from

2.5 Changes in the Drug Environment
To examine the hypothesis that changes in the drug environment are a key source of the
rise in fatal overdoses, I estimate a series of county-level panel data models examining whether
changes in the group-specific composition of opioid analgesic or illicit opioids death rates
correspond, in expected ways, to breaks or reversals in overall mortality trends involving these
drugs. Define 𝑀𝑀𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 as the specified drug mortality rate per 100,000 (adjusted for incomplete

reporting on death certificates) for group 𝑔𝑔 in county 𝑘𝑘 at time 𝑡𝑡.

A first set of estimates will examine the share of fatality rates accounted for by group 𝑔𝑔

in county 𝑘𝑘 at time 𝑡𝑡, 𝑆𝑆𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 , according to:

Page 15

𝑆𝑆𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 = 𝑿𝑿𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌 𝜷𝜷 + 𝑭𝑭𝒌𝒌 κ + 𝑻𝑻𝒕𝒕 𝛕𝛕 + 𝝎𝝎𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈 ,

(14)

for 𝑿𝑿𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌 a set of time-varying county characteristics that always includes the population share of

group 𝑔𝑔, 17 𝑭𝑭𝒌𝒌 a vector of county fixed-effects accounting for all time-invariant determinants, 𝑻𝑻𝒕𝒕 a
vector of year dummy variables and 𝝎𝝎𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈 an error term.

The time coefficients, 𝝉𝝉�, indicate secular changes in the share of drug deaths accounted

for by the population group. However, they do not unambiguously indicate effects of the drug

environment. Consider the decomposition 𝑻𝑻𝒕𝒕 = 𝑫𝑫𝒕𝒕 + 𝒀𝒀𝒕𝒕 , where 𝑫𝑫𝒕𝒕 indicates the (unobserved)

drug environment and 𝒀𝒀𝒕𝒕 other time-varying determinants of mortality such as national economic
conditions or changes in medical technologies. 𝝉𝝉� combines both effects. However, when there
are abrupt breaks or reversals in the drug environment, these are likely to be the dominant

determinant of changes in the time coefficients, so that the pattern of 𝝉𝝉� will be informative. An
exception is if other factors change at precisely the same time and way as 𝑫𝑫𝒕𝒕 . To address this

possibility, I conducted supplementary analyses for additional drug categories that experienced
different breaks in mortality trends than those for opioid analgesics or illicit opioids.
A more formal analysis of whether trend breaks are statistically significant will be
obtained by estimating spline specifications of:
(15)

𝑆𝑆𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 = 𝑿𝑿𝒌𝒌𝒌𝒌 𝜷𝜷 + 𝑭𝑭𝒌𝒌 κ + +𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝜑𝜑 + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋 + 𝝎𝝎𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈𝒈 ,

where 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 is a linear trend ranging from 0 in 1999 to 16 in 2015 and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 is an additional

trend spline equal to 0 in all initial sample years and then increasing by one unit per year after a
specified time period. For instance, the growth in drug deaths is shown below to be dominated by
opioid analgesics from 1999 to around 2010 but by illicit opioids thereafter. This is represented

in (15) by setting 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 to 0 for all years up to 2010 and then increasing it from 1 to 5,

For example, with two population groups, denoted by 𝑔𝑔 = [0,1], and 𝜆𝜆1𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 the county-population share of group 1

respectively, in 2011 through 2015. 𝜑𝜑� then shows the trend in the share of drug deaths accounted

for by group 𝑔𝑔 from 1999-2010, with 𝜑𝜑� + 𝜋𝜋� indicating the corresponding trend from 2011-2015.

The statistical significance of 𝜋𝜋� provides a direct test of the hypothesis that the group’s mortality
share changed starting around 2010.

I also directly examine how drug-specific mortality rates change over time for a treatment
group (e.g. males) relative to a reference group (e.g. females). The basic regression model is:
(16)

𝑀𝑀𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 = 𝑭𝑭𝒌𝒌 κ + 𝑻𝑻𝒕𝒕 𝛕𝛕 + (𝑻𝑻𝒕𝒕 × 𝐺𝐺𝑔𝑔 )𝜽𝜽 + 𝜁𝜁𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 ,

where 𝐺𝐺 is a treatment group dummy variable equal to zero for a reference group and one for a
treatment group, and with 𝜁𝜁𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 a regression disturbance. In (16), the sample includes

observations for two (or more) population groups for each county and year, and controls are
incorporated for county fixed-effects, general time effects and treatment group-time interactions.

Corresponding trend-spline models take the form:

where 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 is a treatment group linear time trend ranging from 0 in 1999 to 16 in 2015 for

the “treatment” group and equal to 0 in all years for the reference group. 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 is an additional

treatment group-specific trend set to 0 initially and then incremented by one unit per year for

treatment group after a specified time period. 𝝉𝝉� shows reference group time effects, 𝜑𝜑� indicates

the initial mortality rate trend differential for the treatment group relative to the reference group,
and 𝜑𝜑� + 𝜋𝜋� shows the corresponding differential in later periods. This model will be run
Page 17

separately for opioid analgesics and illicit opioids and, in supplementary estimates, for heroin,
synthetic opioid, cocaine and methadone deaths, all of which have different timing of breaks or
reversals in mortality trends. 18
All variables for this portion of the analysis are defined at the county-level and so robust
standard errors are clustered by county (rather than commuter zone).

3. Data and Variables
3.1 Dependent Variables
The outcomes examined in the analysis of “deaths of despair” are mortality rates due to
drug poisonings, nondrug suicides and alcoholic liver disease (DSA deaths), as well as overdose
deaths involving prescription and illicit opioids. Primary data come from death certificates
provided on the Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) files (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 2017). Each certificate contains a single underlying cause of death, up to 20
additional causes, and demographic data. Information is utilized on cause of death, using fourdigit International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, county of
residence, age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, year, and weekday of death. Permission was
also obtained to use restricted geographic information on county of residence. The Institutional
Review Board for the Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia reviewed this
project and determined that it did not involve the use of human subjects.
The analysis covers the universe of DSA fatalities to US residents between 1999 and
2015 (foreign residents dying in the US were excluded). The study begins in 1999 because ICD18

Deaths for heroin and cocaine exhibit two trend breaks. For instance, heroin death rates were flat from 19992006, increased modestly from 2006-2010 and sharply from 2010-2015. In these cases, I also estimated models of:
𝑀𝑀𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 = 𝑿𝑿′𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝛼𝛼 + 𝑭𝑭𝒌𝒌 κ + 𝑻𝑻𝒕𝒕 τ + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 𝜑𝜑 + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 𝜋𝜋 + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 𝜎𝜎 + 𝜁𝜁𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 ,
where treatment vs. control group time trend differences were 𝜑𝜑�, 𝜑𝜑� + 𝜋𝜋� and 𝜑𝜑� + 𝜋𝜋� + 𝜎𝜎� in the early, intermediate
and later time periods.
Page 18

9 codes, used earlier, are not fully comparable to ICD-10 categories (R. N. Anderson et al. 2001).
Underlying cause of death (UCD) codes are used to classify the reason for death. Drug
poisonings are defined as fatalities with ICD-10 codes: X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, Y10-Y14 or
Y352. Nondrug suicides include ICD-10 codes X65-X84, Y87.0 and *U03; alcohol deaths refer
to ICD-10 code K70.
For fatal overdoses, the death certificate lists one or more drug categories involved as
immediate or contributory causes of death. These were included separately in the MCOD files as
ICD-10 “T-codes” and are referred to below as drug involvement. The drug categories examined
in the main analysis are opioid analgesics and illicit opioids, which include both heroin and
synthetic opioids, defined by ICD-10 T-codes 40.2, 40.1 and 40.4
(www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88). Synthetic opioids include several types of
drugs, the most important being fentanyl. Fentanyl has legal uses but recent increases in deaths
from this source are largely driven by non-prescription consumption (Rudd et al. 2016).
Although around half of fatal overdoses involve the use of more than one drug category (Ruhm
2016, 2017a), the analysis below does not examine drug combinations.
Death counts are converted into county mortality rates per 100,000 using population data
from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program
(https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/). The SEER data are designed to supply more accurate
population estimates for intercensal years than standard census projections, and adjust for
population shifts in 2005, resulting from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
In addition to total death rates, mortality rates are separately calculated for males and
females, non-Hispanic whites (hereafter “whites”) and nonwhites or Hispanics (hereafter
“nonwhites”), education groups (high school graduate or less, some college but not graduated,

Page 19

college graduate or more among persons aged 25 and above), and for 20-59 year olds, as well as
for other age groups in some analyses. 19

3.2 Economic Indicators
Five county-level proxies for changes in economic conditions are included in the analysis
of deaths of despair: unemployment and poverty rates, median household incomes and home
prices, and exposure to imports. These are designed to capture multiple aspects of the economy
across the domains of labor market conditions, income, wealth and international trade.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics Database
(www.bls.gov/lau/) are used to calculate three-year averages of unemployment rates, ending in
the year specified (e.g. 1997-1999 for the 1999 analysis year). Unemployment rates are averaged
to smooth short-term fluctuations or measurement error, which will be particularly severe for
smaller counties. Information on three-year averages in poverty rates and median household
incomes (ending in the year specified) are obtained from the Bureau of the Census Small Area
Income and Poverty Estimates (www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/). Data on median home prices
in 2000 are from the US Census; later data are 5-year averages from the American Community
Survey (ACS) for the periods 2005-2009, 2007-2011 or 2011-2015. These data are obtained from
various issues of the Area Resource File/Area Health Resource File (ARF),
http://www.arf.hrsa.gov, and from American FactFinder
19

Several challenges are encountered when calculating education-specific mortality rates. First, education is
sometimes reported in years rather than speciﬁc thresholds. In these cases, ≤12, 13–15 and ≥16 years are classiﬁed
were high school graduate or less, some college and college graduate. Second, schooling status is missing on around
5 percent death certificates for overdoses (e.g. 7.2% in 1999 and 4.7% in 2015). Education-specific mortality rates
are computed by assuming that the county-specific distribution of educational attainment is the same for the missing
and non-missing cases. Third, since the SEER data does not provide education-specific population estimates, these
are calculated by multiplying total or group-specific population by the county education group share, with the latter
obtained from 2000 Census and a five-year averages from the 2011-2015 American Community Surveys, as
provided in the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) County Level Data Sets, www.ers.usda.gov/dataproducts/county-level-data-sets/county-level-data-sets-download-data/.
Page 20

(https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). Median household incomes and
home prices are converted to $2015 using the All-Items Consumer Price Index
(www.bls.gov/cpi/). The last economic proxy reflects changes in exposure to Chinese import
competition between 1999 and 2011, using a measure constructed by Acemoglu, et al. (2015),
that builds upon earlier work by Autor, et al. (2013). 20
In some specifications, lagged rather than contemporaneous changes in economic
conditions are controlled for, covering the period from approximately 1990-2000, rather than
1999-2015. These specifications differed slightly based on the available data. Specifically, for
the starting (approximately 1990) period, unemployment rates are averaged for 1990-1992 and
median incomes and poverty rates were averages of 1989 and 1993 values, and the instrumented
import competition variable is from 1990-2000 using data from Autor, et al. (2013).

3.3 Additional Covariates
Most models control for additional covariates designed to capture the potential effects of
confounding variables. Unless otherwise noted, each of these were available for each year during
the analysis period. The SEER data were used to calculate county population shares of: females,
Hispanics, black non-Hispanics, other nonwhite non-Hispanics, seven age categories (15-24, 2534, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, ≥75 years old); county percentages of persons ≥25 years old with
some college or who were college graduates was also included, using previously described

20
Differences in measured trade exposure occur because of variations in local industry employment structure in
1970. They use an instrumental variables procedure to account for the potential endogeneity of US trade exposure;
the instruments are growth of Chinese imports to eight other developed countries. Their trade exposure measure is
calculated at the commuter zone rather than the county level. For this analysis, all counties within a commuter zone
are assumed to have the commuter zone level of import exposure, using a crosswalk of 1990 commuter zones to
counties. The import exposure and crosswalk files were obtained from: www.ddorn.net/data.htm.

Page 21

information from the ACS. 21 The percentage of household headed by females in 2000 and 2010,
and of foreign-born persons in the county in 2000, 2006-2010 and 2011-2015 were obtained
from the ARF. Information on the number of hospital beds and active non-federal physicians per
1,000 population were provided from the same source and included to proxy the county’s health
infrastructure. 22
The USDA ERS county level data sets, described above, also contain information on the
2013 “rural-urban” continuum code of the county, containing the following nine categories:
metropolitan with population ≥1,000,000, 250,000 - 999,999 and <250,000 (three
classifications); urban area with population ≥20,000 and 2,500 – 20,000 and adjacent to or not
adjacent to a metropolitan area (four classifications); rural area with population <2,500 adjacent
to or not adjacent to a metropolitan area (two classifications). In the regression models, dummy
variables for eight of the classifications are included, with the largest metropolitan areas as the
excluded reference group.
Finally, two measures of the state-level legal environment related to drug use are
incorporated. The first indicates whether the state has a prescription drug monitoring program
(PDMP) that requires reporting to it by drug dispensers. The second controls for whether the
state has legalized marijuana use for medical or recreational purposes. Data for both variables
come from the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (www.pdaps.org). They are included
because there is evidence that each may influence drug use and abuse (Bachhuber et al. 2014; A.
C. Bradford and Bradford 2016; Buchmueller and Carey 2018).

21

Thus, in the regressions, the excluded (reference) categories are population shares of males, whites, <15 year olds
and the non-college educated.
22
The number of hospital beds was not available for 2011 and 2015. The former was calculated by averaging values
for 2010 and 2012; the latter by using the 2014 number of beds.
Page 22

Appendix Table A.1 provides summary statistics on the dependent variables, economic
proxies, and additional covariates measured in (approximately) 1999 and 2015, with
observations weighted by 2015 county populations. The analysis sample consists of 3,098
counties with boundaries that are consistent over the time period and with data available for all
of the economic proxies. 23 The table shows actual values; however, as mentioned, the
independent variables are standardized in the regressions. Also, while the table shows actual
changes in median household incomes and home prices, these are reverse-coded (opposite
signed) in the econometric models, so that positive coefficients always indicate that worsening
economic conditions are associated with higher growth in mortality.

3.3 Analysis of Changes in the Drug Environment
The variables included when examining changes in the drug environment differ
somewhat from those for analyzing the role of economic conditions. In this case, instead of a
having a single observation per county (showing mortality rate changes from 1999-2015), this
portion of the investigation includes panel data with 17 observations (one each for 1999-2015)
per county. This allows county fixed-effects to be included, controlling for all time-invariant
county characteristics and reducing somewhat the need for supplementary covariates. Several
variables included in the analysis of medium-term changes in economic conditions are also
inappropriate to here because there is no time-variation in the data (e.g. import penetration
shares) or since annual values would need to be extrapolated or interpolated from a small number
of years (e.g. home price changes and share foreign-born or in female-headed households)
introducing measurement error which is particularly problematic in fixed-effect models. The

23

Three counties were dropped because information on education shares was missing; 24 and 2, respectively, were
excluded because of missing information on import exposure and home prices.
Page 23

results were generally not sensitive to the exact choice of the remaining covariates and the
specific ones included in the primary models are described below. Separate estimates are
frequently provided by sex and for 20-39 year olds (“younger” adults) compared to 40-59 year
olds (“older” adults). The use of two age groupings is convenient for examining changes in agerelated patterns of drug mortality; these groups contain an equal number of years and constitute a
large share of total drug mortality (e.g. 85% in 2015).

4. Descriptive Patterns
Before turning to the econometric estimates, I provide descriptive information on patterns
of drug mortality over the 1999-2015 period. Figure 1 illustrates the changes in total drug death
rates, suicide and alcohol mortality, as well as opioid analgesic and illicit opioid involved drug
mortality rates. The overall drug fatality rate rose steadily, from 6.0 to 16.3 per 100,000 from
1999 to 2015, a 170 percent increase. Nondrug suicide death rates started out considerably higher
(9.3 per 100,000 in 1999) but rose more slowly, reaching 12.1 per 100,000 in 2015. Alcohol
deaths also increased relatively gradually (from 4.3 to 6.5 per 100,000). Conversely, opioid
analgesic and illicit opioid death rates grew extremely rapidly: from 1.3 and 1.2 per 100,000 in
1999 to 4.8 and 7.4 per 100,000 in 2015, but with quite different patterns. All of the rise in
opioid analgesic mortality occurred from 1999-2011, whereas illicit opioid death rates initially
rose modestly, reaching 2.1 per 100,000 in 2006, and then considerably more rapidly thereafter,
particularly from 2010 to 2015, where the mortality rate exploded from 2.6 to 7.4 per 100,000.
Figures 2 and 3 show corresponding patterns of drug and nondrug DSA mortality for
subgroups stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, age and education. In both cases, death rates were
always higher for males than females and for those without a college degree than for the college

Page 24

educated. Whites had higher death rates and faster mortality growth from both sources towards
the end of the sample period but drug mortality rates were similar for whites and blacks (but
higher than for Hispanics or other nonwhites) in 1999, whereas nondrug DSA mortality rates
were already higher for whites than nonwhites in that year. The age relationships were somewhat
more complicated. Drug mortality rates rose at fairly similar rates for 20-39 and 40-59 year olds,
and were somewhat higher for the latter group, which much smaller growth for >60 year olds.
Conversely, alcohol/suicide deaths were much higher for 40-59 and >65 year olds than for
younger persons in all years, with the sharpest trend increase for 40-59 year olds.
Figure 4 shows that illicit opioid death rates exploded for males after 2010, while
growing much more slowly for females and that the particularly rapid rise in opioid analgesic
(illicit opioid) death rates for whites, relative to nonwhites, occurred between 1999 and 2011
(after 2006). Increases in illicit opioid death rates were skewed towards relatively young adults
(20-39 year olds), while those involving opioid analgesics fatalities particularly affected 40-59
year olds.
Appendix Figures A.1 through A.4 detail additional results for drug and nondrug DSA
mortality for sex, race/ethnicity, age and education subsamples. In addition to the findings
already described, they show larger sex differentials for nondrug than drug deaths and faster
mortality rate growth for whites than nonwhites for all types of DSA deaths. As discussed, illicit
opioid deaths skew younger than those due to opioid analgesics, particularly in the later years.
Rates of nondrug suicides are fairly similar for age groups older than 20, although with the
fastest growth over time for 40-59 year olds, while alcohol mortality is heavily concentrated
among persons ≥40 and again among 40-59 year olds. These patterns raise initial doubts about

Page 25

the possibility that a single set of economic determinants can explain these differential patterns
of mortality rate increase.

5. Changes in Economic Conditions: Econometric Results
I next present econometric results examining the extent to which medium-run changes in
county economic conditions predicted corresponding changes in DSA mortality rates. The first
set of specifications shows models controlling for the proxies for economic conditions, but
without supplementary covariates. Additional covariates, a series of robustness checks are
conducted, estimates are provided for population subgroups and investigation is provided of the
effects of remaining selection on unobservables.

5.1 Models without Supplementary Covariates
Table 1 shows regression coefficients for the economic proxies where the dependent
variables are growth from 1999-2015 in mortality rates due to all drugs, opioid analgesic and
illicit opioid involved deaths, all DSA and suicide/alcohol fatalities. 24 These models do not
include controls for potential confounding factors. As mentioned, changes in median household
incomes and home prices were reverse-coded so that positive coefficients always imply that
worse economic performance is associated with faster increases in mortality. Also, all regressors
were standardized so that coefficients show estimated effects of a one-standard deviation change
in the explanatory variable. The top panel table shows results where the economic measures have
been included separately, with every cell representing the results of a different regression. In the
second panel, the five economic proxies have been included simultaneously, and each column

24

Appendix Table B.1 summarizes separate estimates for nondrug suicide and alcohol deaths for many of the
models discussed below. The estimated effects of economic conditions are small in all cases.
Page 26

presents/ findings from a single regression. The third panel shows the multiple proxy (MP)
estimate from the model with the five economic proxies, as well as the percent of the total
mortality change explained by economic conditions.
When controlled for separately, the economic proxy coefficients are positive for all types
of drug mortality and, except for import exposure, highly significant (top panel). For example, a
one-standard deviation decrease in county median household incomes ($2,817 in 2015 dollars) is
associated with a 2.07 per 100,000 faster growth in overdose mortality and a 0.68 per 100,000
increase in the opioid-analgesic-involved drug death rate. Since the standard deviations for these
two outcomes are 10.37 and 3.58 per 100,000, these estimates suggest that a one standard
deviation income reduction predicts around a 20 percent increase in mortality rates from these
sources. The uniformly positive coefficients indicate that counties experiencing relative
economic deterioration had higher than average growth rates of fatal overdoses. Conversely, the
estimated effects are smaller and, except for median home prices, statistically insignificant for
suicide/alcohol deaths, indicating that economic factors play little role. Also, for this reason, the
coefficient estimates are smaller in relative terms for all DSA deaths than for drug mortality.
Including the five economic proxies simultaneously substantially attenuates the estimated
effects of individual economic proxies in virtually all cases (see the middle panel of Table 1).
For instance, the coefficient on median household income is reduced 90 percent for overall drug
mortality and switches sign for illicit opioid deaths and opioid analgesic death rates. This is
expected because the economic variables are reasonably highly correlated with each other,
except for import exposure which is barely associated with the other four measures (see
Appendix Table A.2). The R-squared is also uniformly low, ranging between 0.011 and 0.082,
providing a further indication of the limited explanatory power of changes in economic

Page 27

conditions. With that said, the p-values from the test that the coefficients for the five economic
proxies are jointly equal to zero always indicate that worsening economic conditions predict
higher growth in mortality rates. 25
The third panel of Table 1 shows multiple proxy estimates, obtained using the
Lubotsky/Wittenberg procedure, as well as the estimated percentage of the growth in mortality
rates accounted for by the latent measure of economic conditions. The MP estimate exceeds the
coefficients for any single economic measure (in either the top or middle panel of the table) by at
least 15 percent – and generally much more – indicating the importance of correcting for
attenuation bias. Dividing the MP estimate by the standard deviation of the dependent variable
suggests that changes in economic conditions are associated with 33 percent of the rise in drug
mortality rates, 26 percent of that for all DSA death rates and 26 to 28 percent of those involving
opioid analgesics and illicit opioids, but just 15% of the change in suicide/alcohol fatality rates.
However, these estimates are likely to be serious biased by omitted confounding factors, an issue
addressed next.

5.2 Models With Additional Covariates
The models just described control exclusively for one or more of the economic proxies
and so do not account for potential correlations with county characteristics. Table 2 begins to
remedy this by summarizing models where the dependent variable is the change in drug
mortality rates from 1999-2015 and various sets of controls are included. Column (a) repeats the
results from Table 1, with the five economic variables included simultaneously but nothing else.
25
I also estimated models that controlled for county level Gini coefficients in 2000 or changes from 2000-2010 as an
additional proxy for economic conditions, to capture potential effects of economic inequality not accounted for by
the combination of median incomes and poverty rates. Growth in inequality generally predicted slower growth in
mortality rates, although often by statistically insignificant amounts. Gini coefficients in 2000 were also negatively
related to mortality rate increases and the predicted effects were usually statistically significant.

Page 28

Column (b) adds to this the set of 1999 county characteristics (𝑿𝑿𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏 ) and changes in these

characteristics from 1999-2015 (∆𝑿𝑿), while column (c) includes instrumented rather than actual
changes in the supplementary covariates (∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰 ).
Controlling for 𝑿𝑿𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏 and ∆𝑿𝑿 reduces the multiple proxy estimate by 85% (2.95 to 0.43),

while instead using the instrumented changes, based on census division trends, attenuates it by

73% (to 0.79). The implies that most of the observed relationship between changes in mortality
rates and economic conditions reflects confounding factors. In model (b), “deaths of despair” are
estimated to explain 5 percent of the rise in drug mortality, and 9 percent in column (c),
compared to 33 percent in specification (a). The MP estimates do remain statistically significant,
suggesting that changes in economic factors may continue to play some role but explain less than
10% of the rise in drug death rates. 26 The most important confounding county characteristics are
sex and race/ethnicity differences, as well as the shares of female-headed households and foreign
born persons. Together, these are sufficient to account for all of the attenuation in the MP
estimate in the model controlling for 𝑿𝑿𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏 and ∆𝑿𝑿, and 87% of that when including covariates
for 𝑿𝑿𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏 and ∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰 (see Appendix Table A.3 for details). The age structure of the county also

plays some role but the remaining supplementary covariates, particularly urban-rural status, the
medical infrastructure variables and the two drug policies are much less important.
The first panel of Table 3 repeats the MP estimate and percentage change in drug death
rates accounted for by economic factors. The next four panels show corresponding estimates for
opioid analgesic, illicit opioid, all DSA and nondrug DSA mortality rates. Comparing results for
models (b) and (c) to (a) indicates that at least 73 percent of the original correlation between

26

I estimated drug mortality models with controls additional controls included for 1999 levels of the economic
proxies. These findings, summarized in Table B.2, indicate slightly higher explanatory power of changes in
economic conditions – 9% and 10% of the total mortality change in models with controls for ∆𝑋𝑋 and ∆𝑋𝑋 I – that were
offset by the 1999 levels being responsible for -3% and -9% of the change.
Page 29

economic conditions and various types of drug mortality growth is due to confounding factors,
with more than 100 percent accounted for in some models, and even greater attenuation for the
nondrug DSA deaths. The estimated change in mortality rates accounted for by worsening
economic conditions ranges from 5 to 7 percent for opioid analgesics, -2 to 5 percent for illicit
opioids, and with no effect or a negative impact for non-drug suicide/alcohol deaths. These
findings indicate that “deaths of despair” never account for more than one-tenth of the rise in
mortality and generally considerably less.

5.3 Robustness Checks
I tested the robustness of the results to several changes in specifications, estimation
methods and samples. Table 4 shows the results of models where observations are unweighted,
(second panel), using reported rather than corrected opioid analgesic and illicit opioid death rates
(third panel), and with changes in the economic proxies measured over an earlier period
(approximately 1990-2000) rather than from 1999-2015 (fourth panel). Using unweighted data,
the percentage of changes in mortality rates explained by economic conditions are occasionally
higher than with weighting, but there is no clear pattern and they never account for more than
one-tenth of the total change. 27 The explanatory power of economic conditions is generally of
similar magnitude when using reported rather than corrected opioid mortality rates, with
considerable sensitivity to the choice of specification for illicit opioids. Finally, the percentage of
mortality rate changes explained is always less when controlling for 1990-2000 rather than 1999-

27
Standard deviations on the dependent variables are usually substantially larger in the unweighted data, but this
does not appear to drive the results as the MP estimates also show no clear patterns of differences between the
weighted and unweighted estimates. Unweighted dependent variable means are also generally larger than the
weighted means, indicating higher mortality growth in smaller counties. However, the pattern is reversed for deaths
involving illicit opioids.

Page 30

2015 changes in economic conditions, and are often negative. Overall, these results confirm the
overall conclusion that economic conditions explain little of the rise in mortality rates.
Next, I addressed examined the results from a series of instrumental variables (IV)
models where each economic proxy was instrumented by the other four. As discussed, IV
estimates can eliminate attenuation bias but require the strong assumption that error terms of the
five proxies and the latent variable are uncorrelated. Results of these models, with 𝑿𝑿𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏 and ∆𝑿𝑿

included, are summarized in Table 5. Appendix Table A.4 shows results after controlling for ∆𝑿𝑿𝑰𝑰
rather than ∆𝑿𝑿. Estimation is by generalized method of moments (GMM), to provide efficient
estimates with heteroskedastic errors.

Generally, the IV and multiple proxy estimates (repeated on the bottom panel of the
table) are of roughly similar magnitude, although the IV results are sometimes somewhat greater
when instrumented rather than actual changes in the covariates are controlled for. For instance,
for drug mortality, the IV estimates for the poverty, household income, home price and
unemployment proxies in Table 5 range between zero and 0.85, implying that 0 to 9 percent of
the change from 1999-2015 is explained, versus the MP estimate of 5 percent. The IV estimates
for these four proxies imply that the increase in opioid analgesic and illicit opioid rates explained
by economic conditions is similar to that obtained using the multiple proxy approach, with most
of the predicted effects being statistically insignificant. The IV coefficients on these economic
measures are negative for all DSA deaths, except for a small and statistically insignificant
positive estimate for median household incomes. The estimates for growth in suicide/alcohol
mortality growth are always negative.
The one exception is for import exposure, where the IV coefficients are often quite large
(although not statistically significant in Table 5). However, as mentioned, this explanatory

Page 31

variable is barely correlated with the other economic proxies (see Table A.2) and so is likely to
suffer from a “weak instruments” problem (Bound, Jaeger, and Baker 1995; Staiger and Stock
1997). 28 The bottom-line is that both the MP and IV estimates indicate that changing economic
conditions explain only a small portion of county-differences in the growth of drug fatalities
rates.
Appendix Table A.5 provides estimates for sub-periods where growth in the specified
category of opioid mortality was highest: 1999-2011 for opioid analgesics and 2006-2015 for
illicit opioids. This is done because of the possibility that including periods with little change in
mortality rates may introduce noise into the estimates. However, doing so comes at considerable
cost, both because the changes in economic conditions cover a shorter period and since data
restrictions imply that the dates over which they are measured may not be ideal. For example,
home price information in the American Community Survey is averaged over a five-year period
(e.g. 2011-2015) to obtain sufficient sample sizes. When examining changes in opioid analgesic
mortality from 1999-2011, median home prices averaged from 2007-2011 are compared to those
in 2000. For illicit opioid fatality rates changes from 2006-2015, median home prices averaged
from 2011-2015 are compared to averages from 2005-2009. These poorly captures the dates over
which mortality growth is measured. 29 Also, import exposure continues to be measured from
1999-2011 in all models. In any case, Table A.5 shows that economic conditions explain a
similar portion (2 to 6 percent) of the increase in opioid analgesic fatality rates from 1999-2011
as from 1999-2015, with a modestly larger fraction (4 to 5 percent) of the growth in illicit opioid
mortality rates explained for the shorter 2006-2015 period.
28
As evidence of this, the F-statistic on the first-stage instruments is 72.5, 129.0, 23.6 & 33.0 for poverty, incomes,
home prices & unemployment but just 5.4 for import exposure.
29
The table note provides additional detail on differences in the variables included for sub-periods. Other home
price series do not provide sufficient information of this analysis. For example, Zillow Research
(https://www.zillow.com/research/) provides county-level home value data but only for some (generally larger)
counties.

Page 32

5.4 Subsamples
Table 6 shows the multiple proxy estimates, associated standard errors and percent of the
change in mortality explained for population sub-groups stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and
education, with additional results for 20-59 year olds and non-Hispanic whites aged 20-59 and
45-54. Growth in drug mortality rates, of all types examined, increased relatively more for
whites, 20-59 year olds, whites aged 45-54 and 20-59 and those without a college education than
for their counterparts (see Appendix Table A.6). Declining economic conditions were often
(although not always) also associated with the largest absolute increases in fatality rates for these
groups and explained a greater percentage share of the mortality rate change for some of them
(e.g. whites) but not others (e.g. the non-college educated). For example, overall drug mortality
rates grew by 13.9 per 100,000 for whites versus 4.8 per 100,000 for nonwhites from 1999-2015.
The multiple proxy estimates differed by a similar proportion (0.8 to 1.8 per 100,000 for whites
versus 0.2 to 0.8 per 100,000 for nonwhites) and economic conditions explained an even larger
share of the change for whites (7 to 17 percent versus 2 to 6 percent). However, this was not
always the case. For instance, drug mortality grew faster for men than women, and the absolute
size of the economic effect is generally larger for them, but the share of the mortality growth
explained is usually similar or smaller.
Table 7 provides results separately for counties in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs),
those that are urban but not in MSAs and rural counties. Although much attention has been paid
to the plight of rural areas, the estimates provide no indication that the deaths of despair
argument is more relevant to these locations. To the contrary, the explanatory power of changing
economic conditions is almost highest for metropolitan counties although, even for these, it

Page 33

never accounts for more than 15 percent of the change in mortality. For rural counties, the
percent of the change in drug mortality rates explained ranges between 0 and 3 percent.

5.5 Selection on Unobservables
The analysis to this point treats the vector of supplemental covariates (𝑿𝑿 and ∆𝑋𝑋 or ∆𝑋𝑋 𝐼𝐼 )

as being sufficiently comprehensive to account for all relevant omitted variables, such that

cov(𝐸𝐸𝑘𝑘 , 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 ) = 0. This is a fairly strong assumption. The methods developed by Oster (2016) are
next implemented to examine how the results change if there is remaining selection on

unobservables. As discussed, the key parameters are 𝛽𝛽 𝑜𝑜 , 𝛽𝛽�, 𝑅𝑅 𝑜𝑜 and 𝑅𝑅� , the multiple proxy

coefficients and R-squared from the “short” and “long” regression of equation (1), as well as δ
and 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 , for which values must be assumed. For many applications, Altonji et al., (2005) and

Oster (2016) recommend setting δ=1, implying equal importance of selection on observables and
unobservables. However, in this analysis it seems likely that the most important aspects of the
selection process will have been accounted for. I therefore provide results assuming that δ = 0.5,
implying that selection on observables is twice as important as that on unobservables. Choosing
a higher δ value would further reduce the magnitude of the estimated treatment effect. For the
base model, I also set 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 0.75, which allows for considerable measurement error in the

dependent variable. These values are somewhat arbitrary and so I also present estimates of 𝛿𝛿 ∗ ,
the relative importance of unobservables versus observables, at which the estimated treatment
∗
effect would be zero (with 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 0.75), as well as for 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
value that would give a zero-

treatment effect (with δ = 0.5). The findings are summarized in Table 8. Column (a) shows the
MP estimate without accounting for selection on unobservables. Columns (b) and (c) display the

Page 34

section-corrected estimated effect and percentage of the total mortality rate change explained
∗
with δ = 0.5 and 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 0.75. The last two columns show 𝛿𝛿 ∗ and 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
.

The striking result from Table 8 is that even small amounts of remaining selection on

unobservables are sufficient to eliminate any estimated role for economic conditions as an
explanation for rising mortality rates. For instance, with δ = 0.5 and 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 0.75, 𝛽𝛽 ∗ is less than

zero in all 10 specifications and, in most cases, δ > 0.3 or an 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 > 0.5 would be sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Thus, it seems quite likely that medium-term changes in county-level

economic conditions are completely unrelated to growth in drug or non-drug DSA mortality
rates.

6. Changes in the Drug Environment
I next examine whether changes in the drug environment, rather than in economic
conditions, are the cause of rising drug mortality rates. The identifying feature of this analysis is
that the nature of the fatal drug epidemic changed sharply over time: being driven by opioid
analgesics from the start of the analysis period through around 2010 and then with these
flattening but replaced by explosive growth in fatalities involving illicit opioids. If economic (or
social) factors are of primary importance, this change would not have affected who would die of
fatal overdoses only which drugs would cause the fatalities. By contrast, if population subgroups are at differential risk, changes in the drug environment should alter the composition of
drug mortality. Particularly important in this regard is that data from the 2016 National Survey
on Drug Use and Health indicates that males and young adults are much more likely than their
counterparts to use and abuse illicit drugs, with much smaller differences (sometimes in the
reverse direction) for legal pain relievers or sedatives (Substance Abuse and Mental Health

Page 35

Services Administration 2017). These patterns imply that while it is ambiguous which groups
should have experienced the largest mortality rate growth in the initial stages of the fatal drug
epidemic (which largely reflected increases in opioid analgesic mortality), the drug environment
hypothesis provides a strong prediction that males and young adults should constitute a higher
share of all drug deaths and experience particularly rapid growth in mortality rates in more recent
years (as illicit opioids have become the dominant cause of rising drug fatalities).

6.1 Overall Overdose Death Rates as Proxies of the Drug Environment
Differential trends in overall opioid analgesic and illicit opioid mortality rates (and other
drugs in the supplementary analysis) are used to proxy changes in the drug environment. These
are imperfect measures. Deaths depend on the quantity of drugs consumed and the fatality risk
from a given use. The latter depends in part on drug purity (or lack thereof) and the availability
of risk mitigating technologies (e.g. naloxone). The former reflects the interaction of supply and
demand for the drugs. However, extremely large consumption increases over short periods of
time will almost certainly primarily reflect supply-side factors, since it seems implausible the
underlying components of demand (e.g. health problems causing pain) will exhibit sudden
dramatic changes. Conversely, supply-side factors change dramatically and abruptly as
technologies evolve, for instance, following the introduction of OxyContin in 1996.
A close relationship between opioid analgesic prescribing patterns and deaths at the
national level has previously been demonstrated (Paulozzi LJ, Jones C, Mack K 2011). I used
data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) to confirm that
these patterns also hold at the county-level and after adjusting for incomplete reporting of drug
involvement on death certificates. ARCOS provides information on flows of controlled

Page 36

substances from manufacturers to retail distributors. Quarterly data were obtained at the zip-code
level from 2000-2015 and converted to annual total per capita grams of morphine milligram
equivalents (MME) in the county for seven major opioids. 30 County-level opioid analgesic death
rates per 100,000 were then regressed on grams of MME per capita in models that also included
county-fixed effects. 31 The MME coefficient was .0055498 with a county-clustered robust
standard error of .0002402. MME per capita rose from 134.7 in 2000 to 711.1 in 2011, and fell
modestly thereafter. Based on these results, the increase in per capita MME predicted a 3.17
(95% confidence interval: 2.93-3.47) per 100,000 rise in prescription opioid death rates from
2000-2011, compared to an actual increase of 3.70 per 100,000. This suggests that higher opioid
analgesic prescriptions could explain around 85% of the rise in associated deaths.
Similar consumption data are unavailable for illicit opioids but there is again good reason
to believe that overdose deaths provide a reasonable estimate of environmental factors related to
these drugs. For example, past year use of heroin among persons ≥12 exhibited no trend from
2002-2007, rose modestly from 2007-2010 and more rapidly thereafter (Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration 2017), mimicking almost exactly the pattern of fatal
heroin overdoses (see Appendix Table C.1). Fentanyl reports to the National Forensic Laboratory
Information System increased modestly from 2001 through 2012 but rapidly beginning in 2013
(Drug Enforcment Administration 2017), again mirroring the pattern of deaths.

6.2 Distribution of Drug Deaths
30

The ARCOS data are less complete prior to 2000 so the analysis starts in that year rather than in 1999. See
www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/index.html for further information on the ARCOS data. The seven opioids are:
Oxycodone, Meperidine (Pethidine), Hydromorphone, Hydrocodone, Morphine, Fentanyl and Methadone. They
were converted to MMEs using conversion factors obtained from: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/PrescriptionDrug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovContra/Downloads/Opioid-Morphine-EQ-Conversion-Factors-Aug-2017.pdf.
31
The regressions contain 50,105 observations from 3,140 counties. Observations were weighted by 2015 county
populations.
Page 37

Opioid analgesic death rates rose rapidly from 1999-2010 and remained relatively stable
thereafter, whereas illicit opioid mortality rates changed little from 1999-2005, then began to rise
modestly before exploding after 2010 (see Figure 1). Fatality rates involving other drugs also
changed over the period but not enough to affect the dominance of these trends. This is
illustrated in Figure 5, which displays shares of total drug deaths involving opioid analgesics and
illicit opioids, and differences between the two. The fraction of opioid analgesic overdose
fatalities increased from 21% to 39% from 1999-2010 and then declined to 30% in 2015.
Conversely, the share involving illicit opioids fell from 20% to 16% from 1999-2005, returned to
slightly above its 1999 level in 2010 and then rose dramatically to 45% in 2015.
Since younger adults and men are relatively heavy users of illicit drugs, the drug
environment hypothesis suggests that their share of overall overdose deaths should also rise after
2010. The predictions are less clear for the 1999-2010 period, although fairly rapid growth in
opioid analgesic deaths for persons in their 40s and 50s, documented in Figure 4, suggests that
their share of drug fatalities may be rising during this time-span.
Figure 6 confirms these patterns. It shows estimated year coefficients from regressions of
equation (14), of the group’s share of county-level drug deaths on vectors of year and county
dummy variables, population share and the three measures of county economic conditions for
which annual data are available (unemployment rates, poverty percentages and median
household incomes). 32 The male share of drug deaths declined around 5 percentage points from
1999-2010 and then recovered by approximately 3 percentage points between 2010 and 2015.
Since sex-specific shares sum to one, the pattern is exactly reversed for females. This is not the
case for 20-39 and 40-59 year olds since some overdose deaths involve younger or older persons.

32

After including county fixed-effects, the estimates were not sensitive to the inclusion of other supplementary
regressors with available annual data.
Page 38

Nevertheless, as anticipated, the share of fatal overdoses involving 20-39 year olds (especially
males) declined rapidly from 1999 to 2009 or 2010, and then increased substantially thereafter
while the pattern was reversed for 40-59 year olds overall and 40-59 year old women. 33
Table 9 provides more formal tests of breaks in trend by showing the results of equation
(15) estimated where 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 indicates the initial annual change in group shares of the specified
type of drug deaths, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 introduces a spline into the trend with a knot at 2010, and the

intercept shows the average group share of drug deaths in 1999. The table shows that there is a
break in the initial trend for all groups, except 40-59 year old males after 2010.
The age-related difference is particularly dramatic. For example, 20-39 year olds
accounted for 41% of drug deaths in 1999. This share fell an estimated 0.49 percentage points
per year through 2010 (when opioid analgesics were the driver of the fatal drug epidemic) and
then rose by 0.86 (1.35 - 0.49) points annually thereafter (when illicit opioids came to dominate
the growth in overdose fatalities). The predicted proportion of deaths involving 40-59 year olds
increased by 0.34 percentage points per year initially and then declined by 1.25 points per annum
after 2010. The male share of drug deaths declined by an estimated 0.34 percentage points per
year through 2010 and increased by 0.15 points annually thereafter. (Coefficients for females are
the opposite of those for males and so are not shown on the table.) Younger (20-39 year old)
females show similar but weaker patterns to those for younger males, suggesting stronger age
that gender effects on the composition of drug use. The share of drug deaths accounted for 40-59
year old males declines throughout the analysis period, although faster towards the end of it.

6.3 Sex- and Age-Differentials in Drug-Specific Mortality Rates

33

No clear pattern of trends was predicted or found for 20-39 year old females or 40-59 year old males, given the
potentially offsetting effects of age and sex on legal versus illicit drug use (see Appendix Figure B.1).
Page 39

Finally, I directly examined whether sex- and age-specific opioid analgesic and illicit
opioid mortality rates (and those due to other narcotics in the supplementary analysis) varied
over time in ways consistent with changes in the drug environment. To reiterate, the strongest
prediction is that illicit opioid mortality rates of males and younger adults will rise rapidly late in
the sample period, since these groups are the heaviest users of these drugs, which dominated
growth in the fatal overdose epidemic after 2010.
Figure 7 shows the regression-adjusted differences in the mortality rate changes for
males, relative to females. Figure 8 supplies corresponding information for 20-39 year olds
relative to 40-59 year olds. These are obtained from estimates of equation (16). Solid lines show
the treatment group differential year effects and dotted lines indicate 95 percent confidence
intervals. Vertical lines show years with breaks or reversals in mortality trends (2011 for opioid
analgesic mortality rates and 2005 and 2010 for illicit opioids). Of interest is whether the
treatment (versus reference) group differentials change substantially around these years.
The patterns in figures 7 and 8 align closely with predictions of the drug environment
hypothesis. Most importantly, illicit opioid deaths involving males and 20-39 year olds,
compared to their counterparts, begin to rise rapidly around 2010 or 2011, which coincides with
the timing of the explosive growth in overall fatality rates from this source. There is also some
indication of modest increases after 2005, particularly for males, consistent with the initial (much
slower) growth in illicit opioid deaths. Male opioid analgesic death rates rise relative to those for
females early in the analysis period but decline in relative terms after 2010. This suggests that
there was some substitution by males out of opioid analgesics and into illicit opioids, but this is
dwarfed by the total rise in male illicit opioid death rates. There was no evidence of a trend break
in relative rates of opioid analgesic fatality rates for 20-39 year olds relative to those aged 40-59.

Page 40

These statistical significance of these patterns was confirmed from estimates of equation
(17), where treatment versus reference group trend spline models were estimated knots in 2011
for opioid analgesics and 2010 for illicit opioids. Illicit opioid death rates initially grew
marginally faster for males and young adults year olds than for their counterparts – by 0.03 per
100,000 annually in both cases. However, towards the end of the sample period, the treatment
group relative mortality rates rose dramatically faster – by 0.91 per 100,000 yearly for males and
0.87 per 100,000 for 20-39 year olds. The differences were less dramatic for opioid analgesic
deaths, with some relative trend reductions for the males and young adults late in the analysis
period. However, these were much smaller than the increases for illicit opioid deaths providing
further evidence that the composition of overdose deaths changed.
Appendix C details the results of supplementary investigation of additional drug types:
illicit opioid death rates were decomposed into heroin and synthetic opioid (primarily fentanyl)
rates and with additional analysis of cocaine and methadone involved drug deaths. Each of these
categories exhibited different trends. Heroin death rates changed little from 1999-2006, rose
modestly from 2006-2010 and quickly from 2010-2015. Synthetic opioid mortality increased
slowly from 1999-2013 and then grew by more than 250% from 2013-2015. Cocaine deaths rates
rose substantially from 1999-2006, declined to 1999 levels by 2009 and increased again after
2012. Methadone fatality increased rose dramatically from 1999-2007 and then declined.
Results of the supplementary analysis provide further evidence that the composition of
overdose deaths followed changes in the drug environment. Male heroin death rate differentials
(relative to females) were virtually constant from 1999-2006, began to increase in 2007 and with
accelerated growth after 2010. There was essentially no sex difference in synthetic opioid death
rates through 2013 but with much more rapid male growth starting in 2014. Cocaine and

Page 41

Methadone differentials rose for men from 1999 through 2006 or 2007 and then fell, with a
subsequent increase for male cocaine deaths starting in 2013. There were no age-related
differences in heroin-involved mortality rates from 1999-2006, but rates for 20-39 year olds,
relative to 40-59 year olds, increased slowly from 2007-2010 and more quickly thereafter. Age
differentials in synthetic opioid death rates were constant prior to 2013, but with dramatic growth
for young adults thereafter. Cocaine deaths became increasingly concentrated among 40-59 year
olds from 1999-2006 and were mostly flat subsequently. Age differentials in methadone fatality
rates were nosier but generally trending upwards prior to 2007 and then falling.

7. Discussion
Counties experiencing economic decline from 1999-2015 had experienced larger
increases in drug, suicide or alcohol mortality than those with more robust economic growth.
However, the relationship was fairly weak and mostly due to county characteristics spuriously
correlated with changes in economic conditions. After controlling for these confounding factors,
less than one-tenth of the increase in drug mortality rates was explained by changes in economic
factors and none of those due to nondrug suicides or alcoholic liver disease. Moreover, even
modest amounts of selection on unobservables would be sufficient to completely eliminate any
remaining association.
These results suggest that the “deaths of despair” framing, while provocative, probably
do not explain the main sources of the fatal drug epidemic and imply that efforts to improve
economic conditions in distressed locations, while desirable for other reasons, are unlikely to
yield significant reductions in drug mortality. Such results probably should not be surprising
since drug fatalities increased substantially – including a rapid acceleration of illicit opioid

Page 42

deaths – after the end of the Great Recession (i.e. subsequent to 2009), when economic
performance considerably improved.
Conversely, the data provide more support for the hypothesis that changes in the drug
environment have played a key role. During the first decade of the 21st century, rising drug
mortality was largely driven by increases in opioid analgesic mortality, but with more recent
growth has largely being due to deaths involving heroin and fentanyl. This shift was
accompanied by a change in the composition of deaths, particularly during the period of rapid
growth in illicit opioid mortality, which has been concentrated among males and younger adults.
These findings are consistent with the idea that population subgroups face differential risks that
depend on specific aspects of the public health environment related to drugs.
Efforts to address the fatal drug epidemic will therefore probably have the largest impact
if focused on such environmental factors, including primary prevention and treatment of drug
problems once they emerge. To date, considerable progress has been made in addressing the
harms from opioid analgesics. These efforts include: establishment of drug monitoring programs;
restrictions on pain clinics and online pharmacies; development of abuse-deterrent drug
formulations; promulgation of opioid prescription guidelines; and proposals for mandatory
provider education (Alexander, Frattaroli, and Gielen 2015; Meinhofer 2015; Jones, Lurie, et al.
2016; Meara et al. 2016; Dowell, Haegerich, and Chou 2016; FDA 2016; Madras 2017).
Expanded treatment options should almost certainly play a larger role given the
effectiveness of medication-based approaches utilizing methadone, buprenorphine and
naltrexone (Schwartz et al. 2013; Woody et al. 2014; Mattick et al. 2008). Among the small
proportion of addicts currently receive treatment, medication-based approaches are limited and
often at insufficient dosages (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 2011; Volkow et al.

Page 43

2014; D’Aunno et al. 2014). Naloxone administration saves lives and efforts are underway to
raise its availability to first-responders and caregivers (Compton and Throckmorton 2013; Coffin
and Sullivan 2013; Jones, Lurie, and Compton 2016; Rees et al. 2017), although the benefits may
be offset by increased drug consumption due to a reduction in risk per episode (Doleac and
Mukherjee 2017). Primary prevention of risky drug use is critical but we know less about how to
achieve this. Ongoing physician education efforts are important, particularly in light of recent
evidence that graduates of highly ranked medical schools or in specialties receiving specific
training prescribe fewer opioids than their counterparts (Schnell and Currie 2017). Communitybased prevention strategies have shown promising results (Hawkins et al. 2008; Albert et al.
2011) and efforts to staunch the supply of illicit fentanyl and its analogs are certainly important.
However, there are questions whether an “all-of-the-above” approach, such as the proposed by
the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis (2017), is best
or whether it would be more efficacious to prioritize a smaller set of key initiatives.

Note: In the top panel, each cell shows results of a different regression where the dependent variable is
the specified drug death rate per 100,000 and only a single measure of economic conditions is included in
the model (n=3,098). In the second panel, all five measures of economic conditions are controlled for
simultaneously. Changes in median household incomes and home prices are “reverse coded” (i.e. the
signs are switched from positive to negative and vice versa) so that, for all measures, positive coefficients
indicate that worsening economic conditions are correlated with higher mortality rates. Observations are
weighted by 2015 county populations. Regressors are standardized to have a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one, so that coefficient shows “effect sizes” of a one standard deviation change in
the independent variable. Change in unemployment and poverty rates refer to three-year averages of
annual rates for the periods ending in 2015 versus 1999. Changes in median household incomes ($2015)
Page 50

are from 1999 to 2015. Changes in import exposure are from 1999 to 2011. Drug poisoning deaths refer
to cases where the ICD underlying cause of death code is X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, Y10-Y14 or Y352.
Opioid Analgesic and illicit opioids refer to deaths involving ICD-10 codes T40.2 and T40.1 or T40.4
respectively. DSA indicates deaths from drug poisoning, nondrug suicides or alcoholic liver disease
(alcohol) and nondrug to deaths from nondrug suicides or alcoholic liver disease. Nondrug suicides refer
to ICD-10 codes X65-X84, Y87.0 and *U03, and alcohol to ICD-10 code K70. Deaths involving opioid
analgesics or illicit opioids are adjusted for non-reporting of the drugs involved in overdose deaths using
the methods described in the text. Multiple proxy estimates refer to the model with all economic proxies
simultaneously included and are estimated using the methods discussed in the text. Robust standard
errors clustered at the commuter zone level are in parentheses. The percentage of total change explained
is calculated by dividing the multiple proxy estimate by the standard deviation of the dependent variable.
P-Value refers to the null hypothesis that the five economic measures are jointly equal to zero. *** p<0.01,
** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Note: See note on Table 1. Each column in table shows results of a different model where the dependent
variable is the change in the total drug death rate per 100,000 from 1999-2015. The sample mean change
in the weighted drug poisoning rate is 10.34 per 100,000 and the standard deviation is 9.06 per 100,000.
X1999 refers to controls for county population shares of: females, Hispanics, black non-Hispanics, other
nonwhite non-Hispanics, age categories (15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, ≥75 years old), and
person with some college or college graduates (among those ≥25 years old), % female headed
households and foreign-born. Also included are controls for 8 urban-rural categories (metropolitan with
population 250,000-999,999; metropolitan with population <250,000; urban with population ≥20,000
adjacent to a metropolitan area or not adjacent to a metropolitan area, urban with population 2,50019,999 adjacent or not adjacent to metropolitan areas, and rural with population <2,500 and adjacent or
not adjacent to metropolitan areas), active non-federal physicians and total hospital beds per 1,000 and
whether the state legal medical/recreational marijuana and prescription drug monitoring program (two
variables). These were measured in the 1999, except urban-rural location is from 2013, % female-headed
households and % foreign-born are from 2000. ∆X refers to changes in these supplementary covariates
between 1999 and 2000, except in the later year, % female-headed households are from 2010 and %
foreign-born are the average from 2011-2015. ∆XI refers to instrumented changes in these supplementary
covariates calculated by adjusting 1999 values by the changes in these variables, from 1999-2015,
occurring at the census division level (see the text for additional details). *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Note: See notes on Tables 1 through 3. Column (a) shows multiple proxy estimates without correction for
selection on unobservables (from Table 3). Columns (b) and (c) show the selection-adjusted treatment
effect and% of the change in mortality rates explained, assuming that δ=0.5 and Rmax=0.75. Column (d)
shows the value of δ that would give an estimated zero treatment effect, with Rmax=0.75, and column (e)
shows the Rmax value that would do so, with δ=0.5. Rmax < 𝑅𝑅� 0.75 implies that the hypothetical R-squared
that would eliminate the treatment effect is less than the observed R-squared from the model that
includes supplementary covariates.

Note: Table shows predicted trends in percentages of drug poisoning deaths occurring among the specified group. The “Trend” coefficient shows
the annual time trend, in percentage point terms, compared to 1999. “Post” shows deviations from the general trend for the period after 2010.
Intercept shows the estimated group-specific mean value of the dependent variable in 1999. Estimates are obtained from county-level regressions
also control for county fixed-effects and the group population share. Sample contains 36,207 county-year observations, for 3,062 counties with a
positive number of drug deaths in the specified year. Observations are weighted by 2015 county populations. Robust standard errors, clustered at
the county level, are shown in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Note: Table shows differences in intercepts and time trends for males compared to females and 20-39
versus 40-49 year olds. The “Trend” coefficient shows the general difference in time trends between the
treatment and reference groups. “Post” show deviations from the general trend for periods after a change
in the overall trend effect. Specifically, “Post” refers periods to starting in 2011 for opioid analgesics and
2010 for illicit opioids. Regressions also control for county fixed-effects and year dummy variables.
Sample contains 106,426 group-year observations from 3,132 counties. Observations are weighted by
2015 county populations. Robust standard errors, clustered at the county level, are shown in
parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
