    "abstract": "\n\nShort-run interindustry comovement may be due either to common shocks or to complementarities that propagate shocks across sectors. This paper assesses the importance of input-output linkages, aggregate activity spillovers, and local activity spillovers to comovement in postwar US manufacturing.  I find that input-output linkages and local activity spillovers are important to comovement, while aggregate activity spillovers are not important.  I find that complementarities are important to aggregate volatility, even after I remove observable aggregate shocks from the data.  Local spillovers are particularly important, explaining between 15 and 36 percent of manufacturing employment volatility.\n\n",
