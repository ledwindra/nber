    "abstract": "\n\nCross-border financial flows arise when (otherwise identical) countries differ in their abilities to use assets as collateral to back financial contracts. Financially integrated countries have access to the same set of financial instruments, and yet there is no price convergence of assets with identical payoffs, due to a gap in collateral values. Home (financially advanced) runs a current account deficit. Financial flows amplify asset price volatility in both countries, and gross flows driven by collateral differences collapse following bad news about fundamentals. Our results can explain financial flows among rich, similarly-developed countries, and why these flows increase volatility.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nCross-border financial flows arise when otherwise identical countries differ in their abilities to use assets as collateral to back financial contracts. Countries have access to the same financial instruments\u2014there are no interest rate differentials, nor risk-sharing motives to trade assets. Trade in financial assets is a way to internationally share scarce collateral. Financial integration leads to a divergence in the prices of assets with identical payoffs due to a gap in collateral values. Home (financially advanced) runs a trade deficit, which reverses in crises. Financial integration increases asset price volatility, and flows driven by collateral differences are procyclical.
