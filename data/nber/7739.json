    "abstract": "\n\nWith fixed costs of participating in the stock market, consumers with high income will participate in the stock market, but consumers with lower income will not participate.  If a fully-funded defined-contribution social security system tries to exploit the equity premium by selling a dollar of bonds per capita and buying a dollar of equity per capita, consumers who save but do not participate in the stock market will increase their consumption, thereby reducing saving and capital accumulation. Calibration of a general equilibrium model indicates that this policy could reduce the aggregate capital stock substantially, by about 50 cents per capita.\n\n",
