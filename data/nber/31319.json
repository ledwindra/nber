    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper documents how US firms organize goods production across firm and country boundaries.  Most US firms that perform physical transformation tasks in-house using foreign manufacturing plants in 2007 also own US manufacturing plants; moreover manufacturing comprises their main domestic activity.  By contrast, \u201cfactoryless goods producers\u201d outsource all physical transformation tasks to arm's-length contractors, focusing their in-house efforts on design and marketing.  This distinct firm type is missing from standard analyses of manufacturing, growing in importance, and increasingly reliant on foreign suppliers.  Physical transformation \u201cwithin-the-firm\u201d thus coincides with substantial physical transformation \u201cwithin-the-country,\u201d whereas its performance \u201coutside-the-firm\u201d often also implies \u201coutside-the-country.\u201d Despite these differences, factoryless goods producers and firms with foreign and domestic manufacturing plants both employ relatively high shares of US knowledge workers.  These patterns call for new models and data to capture the potential for foreign production to support domestic innovation, which US firms leverage around the world.\n\n",
