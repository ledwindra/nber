    "abstract": "\n\nSocial commentators from William Julius Wilson to Charles Murray have argued that increased sorting of people into internally homogeneous\" neighborhoods,schools, and marriages is spurring long-run inequality.  Cali- bration of a formal model suggests that these fears are misplaced.  In order to increase the steady-state standard deviation of education by one percent, the correlation between neighbors' education would have to double, or the correlation between spouses' education would have to increase by one-third. In fact, both correlations have declined slightly over the past few decades. Sorting has somewhat more significant effects on intergenerational mobility than on inequality.\"\n\n",
