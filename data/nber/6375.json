The behavioral principles discussed are: prospect theory, regret and cognitive dissonance mental compartments, overconfidence, over- and underreaction, representativeness heuristic disjunction effect, gambling behavior and speculation, perceived irrelevance of history thinking, quasi-magical thinking, attention anomalies, the availability heuristic contagion, and global culture.\n\n",
